  "<p>House of Fraser, the department stores group, is back in the bid spotlight despite its most active pursuers selling their shares yesterday. </p> <p>Tom Hunter and Baugur, the Icelandic retailer which backed last year's abortive bid of 85p a share for the company by the Scottish entrepreneur, yesterday disposed of their collective 21% stake.</p> <p>But the ease with which Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein placed the stake at 113p suggested that House of Fraser is being eyed by overseas investors. Market rumours suggested that the ambitions of some to acquire big blocks of stock from the share placement were thwarted. </p> <p>House of Fraser shares fell 9p to 118p as investors imitated the two big sellers and took profits following the retreat of the most recent suitors. But sources close to the placing suggested there was considerable appetite for the stock, particularly from mainland Europe. </p> <p>The transaction is understood to have been at the initiative of DKW rather than a reflection of any investment fatigue on the part of Mr Hunter or Baugur. \"We identified buying interest over the recent period and used that as the backdrop against which to initiate a divestment,\" a source close to the deal said. </p> <p>House of Fraser was said to be happy with the way in which the placing was conducted. Stock was snapped up within an hour of being offered and new investors were characterised as being long-term, quality holders. </p> <p>The investment in the group has been profitable for Mr Hunter and Baugur. They are thought to have netted combined profits approaching \u00a320m from their holdings. </p> <p>Having topped up their war chests, they will now inevitably, be associated with any bid speculation in a retail sector which has seen considerable activity, notably Philip Green's failed \u00a39.2bn bid for Marks &amp; Spencer. </p> <p>\"This probably means that Tom Hunter will be twinned with every rumour in the sector from now on,\" said Iain McDonald at stockbroker Numis Securities. </p> <p>House of Fraser has not been immune to the difficulties which have plagued the high street over the last few months. The combination of a wet summer and falling demand from consumers has contributed to the difficulties the company has faced. </p> <p>Despite the recent problems in the retail sector, House of Fraser shares have had sustained investment support over the last 12 months. The sector is still regarded as ripe for further takeover activity, which has underpinned share prices and provided a counter to the negative investment fundamentals created by a hostile trading environment. </p> <p>House of Fraser shares languished below 50p before Mr Hunter indicated he might be prepared to make bid towards the end of 2002. </p> <p>His approach was withdrawn when House of Fraser refused to open its books to his scrutiny. Baugur supported his initiative and Mr Hunter, having refused to make a formal bid early last year, increased his stake in the company to 11% a little under a year ago. </p> <p>House of Fraser shares hit a 52-week low on September 30 last year, closing at 90p.</p>",
  "<p>The Graeme Souness era at Newcastle United began officially yesterday. </p> <p>Souness revealed a few things, about himself, about Alan Shearer, Kieron Dyer and how he sees the black-and-white future. To borrow a phrase used by his new chairman Freddy Shepherd, as Souness pressed the flesh and the right buttons, he showed he has \"something about him\". </p> <p>Souness will need everything about him to be a success at a club where even more famous and celebrated forerunners have, sometimes narrowly, failed. Souness has a two-year contract that becomes a rolling 12-month deal for season 2006-07. </p> <p>Having worked in passionate football cities such as Liverpool, Glasgow and Istanbul, Souness said he was relishing the challenge of Newcastle. </p> <p>\"Going back to being a player, the bigger the occasion the more I enjoyed it,\" Souness said. \"That turns me on. I know the downside to it. I know the media will be critical at times but that's not new - go and work in Glasgow. That's a difficult place to work and I accept this will be the same. I know what will happen if we don't perform to the standards that everyone wants. I'm a big boy. </p> <p>\"The answer is yes, I am looking forward to working in this environment. Maybe I missed that at Blackburn. Blackburn is a fantastic club, fabulous people run it and it's a super place to work but the time for me to move on was right. I could not say no to this job. Outside of Fergie and Wenger, who's going to say no to this job?\" </p> <p>Souness and Shepherd were both of the opinion that \"all the ingredients are in place\" to try to bring that elusive silverware to Tyneside and Shepherd added: \"Of course there is money there to buy players in the window.\" Souness mentioned \"two or three clever additions\" to the squad and refreshingly he did not try to camouflage the fact that Newcastle's central defence requires priority attention. </p> <p>To that end the former Manchester United and Aston Villa centre-half Ronny Johnsen is in talks regarding an initial six-month contract. Johnsen is out of contract and is free to join Newcastle. </p> <p>As it is, Souness, 51, will inherit a squad he described as: \"The best I've had in terms of the quality of player I'm going straight in to work with. </p> <p>\"When you go to a big club, generally that club is in turmoil. Maybe turmoil is too strong, but in a bit of a mess. </p> <p>\"But this club is not in turmoil. The club is in tremendous financial nick, the chairman has done a wonderful job in that department, Sir Bobby Robson has done a great job in getting some great footballers here, supporters turn up and they're like a throwback. </p> <p>\"Everything is right at this football club. This differs in the sense that, when I went to both Liverpool and Rangers, the clubs were in decline.\" </p> <p>Of the much heralded disciplinarian tag, Souness said: \"Everyone starts with a clean slate, it has to be like that. </p> <p>\"You know, I was young once. Nobody liked a night out more than me. The north-east is a good place to have a night out and I used to come here to do that. I know the pitfalls and they have to understand that now is a different time. We'll get the message across slowly. I don't believe there's a group of monsters in that dressing room who need the big stick.\" </p> <p>And of targets for a season that is only five games old, Souness said he would \"take the Champions League now\". But failure to challenge for the top four places, particularly after money is spent in January, will prompt a reaction from Shepherd who said: \"There's nothing transitional about this season.\"</p>",
  "<p>The battle for control of the nascent music download market today stepped up a gear as internet giant Yahoo! announced that it had agreed to buy US music software company MusicMatch in an \u00a389m deal. </p> <p>The move will see the Californian dotcom bellwether taking on Apple's iTunes Music Store and Microsoft's recently announced digital music service. It plans to use MusicMatch's online store and jukebox software to augment its own internet radio service, Launch. </p> <p>Boosted by the popularity of Apple's iPod and online music stores such as the new, legitimate incarnation of Napster, sales of digital music are expected to grow sharply in the next two years. </p> <p>Yahoo! has to date pursued a policy of pushing its Launch service in the US and Europe.</p> <p>This provides listeners with interactive online radio stations tailored to their taste and accompanying music videos. </p> <p>The purchase of MusicMatch will give it a readymade download store with 700,000 tracks and music playing software to compete with Apple, Napster, Sony and the dozens of other online stores that have sprung up in the past 18 months. </p> <p>MusicMatch also recently launched a subscription service, allowing consumers to access its entire library of tracks for a monthly fee. </p> <p>Yahoo! chief executive Terry Semel said that the company was \"committed to being a major player in digital music\".</p> <p>\"This combination bolsters our strategy to capture the largest audience of consumers as they make the shift to digital music, and supports Yahoo's goal to give consumers the greatest choice, control and flexibility in how they interact with music,\" he added. </p> <p>The music company is the latest in a string of acquisitions by Yahoo! with which it has attempted to widen its appeal and boost revenues.</p> <p>In the past two years it has also bought recruitment site Hotjobs, search marketing company Overture, search technology company Inktomi and shopping comparison site Kelkoo in deals worth a total of more than \u00a32bn. </p> <p>After years of viewing the internet as a threat, record companies have recently become enthusiastic advocates of online sales as a means of boosting flagging sales figures.</p> <p>In an effort to further promote the medium, the first official download chart launched earlier this month as a precursor to including digital sales in the official top 40.</p> <p>Record labels are watching with interest to see whether consumers prefer Napster's mixture of subscription and permanent downloads, iTunes' straightforward download service or OD2's hybrid version. </p> <p>In the US, iTunes is the clear market leader with a market share of more than 70%, selling more than 100 million songs since it launched last year. In Europe, it recently announced that it had already sold more than 5 million tracks since launching three months ago. </p> <p>In the UK, much depends on whether Apple's rivals can topple the iPod as the most popular digital music player. Tracks downloaded on iTunes only work with the iPod, while those downloaded using other services will work on a variety of similar devices. </p> <p>Today's deal is the latest in a flurry of activity as the giants of the technology world look to take a lead in the world of digital music. </p> <p>Earlier this year the US digital media company LoudEye, bought OD2, the service co-founded by former Genesis frontman Peter Gabriel, for around \u00a321m in a bid to become the global leader in business-to-business downloads.</p> <p>OD2, the European leader until the arrival of iTunes, does not run a download service itself but provides the technology behind online music retailers such as Coca-Cola, MTV and MSN.</p> <p> <strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "<p>Tony Blair warned today that time was \"running out\" to avert the human and economic catastrophe of unchecked climate change.</p> <p>Speaking at a round-table discussion about the environment, ahead of a speech on the subject this evening, the prime minister described global warming as a \"huge issue\" which needed renewed political will if it was to be tackled.</p> <p>Mr Blair is tonight expected to call for a \"green industrial revolution\" and promise to use Britain's presidency of the G8 group of leading industrial nations next year to push for greater international cooperation to tackle climate change. </p> <p>But Mr Blair will not confirm whether the UK government will expand the use of nuclear power, which many scientists believe is essential to cut greenhouse gas emissions. </p> <p>Questioned about the issue on BBC Radio 1's Newsbeat programme, he said: \"I think there are still major problems [with nuclear power] ... we have to handle the issues to do with storage and waste.\"</p> <p>\"We're not shutting the door on anything but you have to take account of those realities,\" he added. \"And in the meantime there are other technologies that we could be using that would make a significant difference to climate change.\" </p> <p>Mr Blair's speech comes after he was criticised yesterday by the Conservative leader, Michael Howard, for his failure to persuade the US to sign up to the Kyoto protocol, which was designed to reduce greenhouse gases emissions. </p> <p>Mr Howard also side-stepped the nuclear issue yesterday; excluding it from his speech, and replying when challenged about it afterwards that it was a matter for a Conservative government to decide once in office. </p> <p>Scientists are increasingly pushing for the government to give the go ahead for an expansion in nuclear energy, as the only means for Britain to meet its Kyoto target to cut greenhouse gas emissions.</p> <p>A report in today's Times claims that the director of strategic development at the Department of Trade and Industry's energy unit, Adrian Gault, has told ministers that nuclear power will have to provide half of Britain's electricity needs if it is to do so. </p> <p>Currently, nuclear power provides only a fifth of Britain's electricity, but the nation's nuclear power plants are ageing and will be closed down progressively from 2008. </p> <p>Earlier today, Mr Blair's official spokesman played down the DTI advice, describing it as only an option paper, which has not been seen by ministers.</p> <p>Speaking at the round-table discussion, Mr Blair was pessimistic about the prospects of the US government changing its position.</p> <p>\"Let's be absolutely blunt about it: I do not think the US Senate is going to vote for ratification of Kyoto. It would be nice if they did, but I can't see it. </p> <p>\"We have to do two things at the G8 - the first is an explicit acceptance of the science by all the governments there. That has not really happened up until now for a very obvious reason, because the next question is: 'Well, what are you going to do about it?' </p> <p>\"The next thing we need is an agreement on the process to take this forward. That will require an examination of the science and technologies... step by step so that certain measures are taken.\"</p> <p>This evening, Mr Blair is also expected to focus on the environmental impact of the expanding airline sector, saying that he wants to use Britain's presidency of the EU next year to press for the aviation industry to be brought within the EU's emissions trading scheme. </p> <p>And he will say that it is his ambition to use Britain's G8 presidency to \"build a scientific and policy consensus among governments around which vigorous global action can be taken\". </p> <p>The prime minister plans to host a conference on climate change at the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research in February in advance of the G8 summit at Gleneagles in Scotland. </p> <p>He will also add that Britain can lead the world in developing renewal energies, such a wave and tidal power, bio-energy and hydrogen fuel cells. </p> <p>\"We need a green industrial revolution for the 21st century that sustains growth but protects the environment,\" he is expected to say.</p>",
  "<p>British universities are enrolling more foreign students than ever before but the UK's share of the mushrooming global market in higher education is slipping, according to figures released today. </p> <p>The annual study, Education at a Glance, by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), found that between 1998 and 2002 foreign enrolment increased by 34%, with 1.9m students enrolling on courses in OECD areas outside their own country. </p> <p>The UK's share of the market for foreign students dropped from 16% to 12% in this period although it remains joint second with Germany, behind the US which has 30%. The only other near competitors for attracting overseas students are Australia with 10% and France with 9% of the global market. </p> <p>Andreas Schleicher, an OECD analyst, said the UK remained \"a favourite student destination\" and added: \"The UK has traditionally been a country very open to foreign students. Other countries have emulated this.\" </p> <p>The economic forces driving the global market in knowledge are easy to see in the OECD report - graduates earn considerably more than non-graduates - 86% more in the US - and there is no sign that the massive increase in the numbers going to university is cheapening the value of a degree. For the graduate, the cost of university remains a very good investment, argues the report.</p> <p>It states: \"As new data show for the first time, rising tertiary education levels among citizens seem generally not to have led to an inflation of the labour-market value of qualifications. On the contrary, among the countries in which the proportion of 25-64 year-olds with tertiary qualifications increased by more than 5 percentage points since 1995 - Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Ireland, Japan, Korea, Spain and the United Kingdom - most have seen falling unemployment and rising earnings benefits among tertiary graduates over the last years.\"</p> <p>Although the UK government's target of 50% of young people entering higher education remains controversial, it is only the average across OECD countries, where half of today's young adults now enter universities or other institutions offering similar qualifications at some stage during their life. </p> <p>An average 32% complete a first university-level degree, but this ranges from less than 20% in Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany and Switzerland to 45% in Australia and Finland. </p> <p>The report adds: \"Almost all OECD countries have seen a rise in the education levels of their citizens over the past decade, and in some countries the increase has been spectacular. Enrolment in tertiary education, which covers both university-level education and high-level vocational programmes, increased between 1995 and 2002 by more than 50% in the Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Korea and Poland, and by more than 20% in Australia, Finland, Ireland, Mexico, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. </p> <p>\"Austria, France and Germany are the only countries which did not see increases, mainly because rising enrolment rates could not make up for the demographic decline in these countries.\"</p> <p>A spokesman for the Department for Education and Skills said: \"Foreign student enrolment worldwide has increased by a third between 1998 and 2002. The UK has more than held its own, but the cake has got bigger. </p> <p>\"We have every intention of remaining one of the most popular destinations for overseas students. The British Council estimates that the UK economy could earn \u00a313bn a year from international students by 2010.\" </p>",
  "<p>Mistrust and community infighting are hampering the government's flagship \u00a32bn regeneration programme, a Commons committee warned today.</p> <p>The public accounts committee (PAC) said the New Deal for Communities programme was showing \"early promising signs\", but highlighted the problem of difficult relationships between councils and community-based partnerships set up to run the programmes. </p> <p>The committee's chairman, Edward Leigh, the Tory MP for Gainsborough, said: \"It is too early to judge the full results of the New Deal for Communities [NDC] programme, but there are some promising signs that it is achieving successful neighbourhood renewal.\"</p> <p>He added: \"At the same time I am disappointed that mistrust and tensions between NDC partnerships and local authorities have got in the way of progress. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister must address this, for example by setting out clearly local authorities' responsibilities with respect to the programme.\" </p> <p>Under the programme around \u00a350m has been earmarked for 39 separate deprived areas over a 10-year period. The money is supposed to be spent according to local priorities set by partnership boards led by local representatives. </p> <p>In a number of areas the programme has been dogged by delays and bitter disputes between community groups, local councils and professionals implementing the scheme. </p> <p>In its report on the programme, the cross-party committee found: \"Local authorities have not had sufficiently clear guidance on how best to manage their relationship with NDC. Some have attempted to micro-manage their local NDC for example, by introducing excessive scrutiny over project proposals. </p> <p>\"Other authorities have merely acted as bankers, offering little or no professional support and advice. </p> <p>\"Government offices could play a more positive role where there are tensions or disengagement between boards and local authorities.\" </p> <p>The programme was launched by the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, in 1999 as a means of giving local communities greater influence over the way in which funds were directed to tackle deprivation. NDC boards are expected to work in partnership with existing agencies to reduce crime, unemployment, poor health, low educational performance and improve the physical environment. </p> <p>Elsewhere in its report, the committee urged Mr Prescott's office to work with other government departments to streamline initiatives aimed at deprived communities, noting that in some areas the NDC scheme was only one of more than 50 different initiatives. </p> <p>It also warned that it was important that problems in a selected neighbourhood, such as crime and disorder, were addressed rather than displaced to adjacent communities. </p> <p>The regeneration minister, Lord Rooker, said: \"We welcome the PAC's report, which recognises the New Deal for Communities is an innovative approach to tackling the toughest regeneration challenges, and is already showing signs of success. </p> <p>But he acknowledged the problems with the programme. \"NDCs can only deliver real, lasting change when local people and partner agencies work together. In some areas, barriers and mistrust have built up, and I share the committee's disappointment at this.\"</p> <p>Lord Rooker added: \"NDCs are not a threat to the traditional structures, but an asset. Those that are showing the most impressive results so far are in areas where the local authority appreciates this and actively supports and engages with the partnership.\"</p>",

  "<p>Just over a week ago, Frank McGuinness was glued to the TV and the terrible images that were emerging in the wake of the siege at School Number One in Beslan. He dragged himself away to go to the first run-through of his latest play, a new version of Euripides's rarely performed Hecuba. When the rehearsal finished, everybody in the room was silent, so acutely aware were they of the parallels between this 2,500-year-old Greek tragedy and the grim scenario unfolding in Russia.</p> <p>\"Everyone at the rehearsal felt such despair at what had happened at Breslan. You think, what can we possibly do?\" says McGuinness. \"All we can do is produce and perform the play, knowing that Euripides's words speak directly to us about what we humans are capable of doing to each other and our children.\" </p> <p>Set in the aftermath of the defeat of Troy, Hecuba charts the grief and revenge of the deposed queen who has seen her husband and sons humiliated and slaughtered and her daughters raped and dragged off to be enslaved by the enemy. There was a time when McGuinness was \"scared\" of Greek tragedy, although that changed when he adapted Electra for the Donmar in 1997; with Zoe Wanamaker in the lead, the production subsequently transferred to rapturous acclaim on Broadway. But if Electra was gritty, then Hecuba is as hard and unforgiving as a piece of granite. </p> <p>It is often thought of as a broken-backed play, or two entirely different plays, as the suffering Hecuba of the first half is transformed into the terrifying, avenging dark angel of the second. McGuinness is having none of that kind of talk. \"There is a very clear psychological journey. I understand this woman. I understand very well what it is like to live in the aftermath of war.\" </p> <p>So he should. Born in 1953 in the seaside town of Buncrana in County Donegal, close to the border with Derry, McGuinness has lived through the long war in Northern Ireland and the terrible violence that has erupted during the attempts to make the peace. He sees himself very much as a chronicler of conflict. In his first major success 20 years ago, Observe the Sons of Ulster Marching Towards the Somme, he wrote so well of the experiences of the Ulster volunteers in the trenches of the first world war that to this day some people assume he was brought up a Protestant, not a Catholic. In Dolly West's Kitchen, set in Buncrana during the second world war, he shows the dangers of remaining neutral, either politically or morally, in times of war. One of his best known plays, Someone to Watch Over Me, meanwhile, was inspired by the hostage-taking in the civil war-riven Beirut of the 1980s. </p> <p>\"If I hadn't been born where and when I was, I doubt I would have become a playwright,\" he admits. \"But if you want to write about war and its impact on people's lives, plays are a good form to choose. To put it at its crudest, plays are conflict, and I find conflict interesting.\" </p> <p>The war in Iraq and the subsequent bloody so-called peace has seen a recent spate of revived and rewritten Greek tragedies that appear on our stages as if as a reflection of the political situation. But it was the aftermath of the war in Ireland and the peace process of the mid-1990s, not the war in Iraq, that McGuinness had in mind when he first started work on Hecuba. The Omagh bombing in particular was the catalyst. </p> <p>\"Two of the children who died that day came from the same estate in Buncrana where I grew up. At their funeral, the sister of one of the boys started crying and the sound she made seemed to come from the earth itself. It made me think about a grief so terrible and powerful and what it can do.\" He pauses and as he continues you can hear the regret in his voice: \"I heard that sound again when I was watching the women of Beslan crying for their children. It was the same sound multiplied many, many times.\" </p> <p>McGuinness is genuinely horrified that events in Russia mean that Hecuba is an even more potent comment on the terrible pain of grief and the cycle of atrocities and revenge that can follow. He believes that, unlike war poets, war playwrights need a little distance from the events they are dealing with. \"Unlike the poet, the playwright doesn't articulate one person's experience or psyche. In a play, you create a multitude of characters and viewpoints and to do that you need some distance. If you are too emotionally or politically engaged, it isn't good for the play. If you let righteousness carry you away, you are not writing theatre, you are writing propaganda.\" </p> <p>Three years ago, when September 11 happened, McGuinness was just beginning to write a short play for the National Theatre. \"I knew at once that September 11 would have a major impact on my creative life. The National commission gave me the opportunity to address it - but the very last thing I wanted to do was respond immediately. I wanted to take my time. I don't want to be on my soapbox or offering prophecies to the world. I don't like prophets.\" </p> <p>But when a play takes a long time to write - and McGuinness's version of Hecuba has taken six years - events can overtake it. The war in Iraq was happening as McGuinness was working on the text, and having seen in Ireland the difficulty of achieving peace after conflict, he was not impressed by Bush's glib pronouncements of \"mission accomplished\". </p> <p>\"I am certainly not a pacifist; pacifism is not an adequate political philosophy. I firmly believe that there are times when you have to take up arms - and I have respect for all those men and women who are most reluctant to do so, but who feel in the end that they must. It is no accident that that warmonger George W Bush has never been to war himself or that Tony Blair has never done service and is so willing to send his own people to fight lunatic wars. If you create an environment where the waging of war is your solution, you are in terrible danger of unleashing something terrifying and demonic that you will never be able to control. </p> <p>\"War plays remind us of that. Hecuba reminds us of that. It is not a comforting play, particularly not for these dangerous times when there is so much grief. It shows that there is a dark hardness that we all possess, and that the impulse for revenge and war comes from within us all. That means nobody is safe.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Hecuba opens at the Donmar Warehouse, London WC1, tomorrow. Box office: 0870 060 6624</p>",
  "<p>So, I am at Santa Pod Raceway in Northamptonshire, behind the wheel of a Top Methanol category dragster. And not just any old Top Methanol dragster: the American Car Imports dragster, normally driven by the newly crowned European champion, Dave \"Grumpy\" Wilson. But Grumpy has gamely stood aside for a couple of minutes to let me have a go. And, as I have astutely observed, within seconds of sliding into the cockpit, the American Car Imports dragster differs from the car I normally drive in a number of key areas.</p> <p>For one thing, the bonnet is 25ft long, and held merely 3in off the ground by what is in effect a pair of pram wheels. Also, intensive stickering reveals the dragster to be sponsored by, among others, PlayStation 2, whose cash-rich backing for my own, private driving, I have never quite managed to secure. And, unlike in my car, the engine, mounted hard behind the driver's head, and keeping the fat rear wheels apart, has eight cylinders, generates in excess of 3,500bhp and is only marginally smaller than a three-bedroom bungalow.</p> <p>Sometimes, under acceleration, it burns so much fuel so quickly that there isn't room for all the combustion to take place inside the engine. Thus some of the fuel leaps out and does its burning in a startlingly orange halo around the back end. At which point, the dragster appears to be emerging from a ball of fire. Again, this isn't really in the repertoire of the car I drive at home. I did once have a Peugeot 205 which did something similar towards the end of longer journeys, but I decided to get rid of it. </p> <p>Something else the dragster does which my car doesn't: it routinely reaches speeds in excess of 250mph in under five seconds. That's quite fast. It's not the fastest-accelerating race car in the world: that's the Top Fuel dragster, which looks exactly the same as the Methanol dragster, but runs on nitro and would hope to reach over 300mph in that time. </p> <p>But that's just silly. You've got to ask yourself: do you really need to go that fast? Surely, 250mph is enough for any normal person's everyday needs. </p> <p>A Top Methanol dragster would leave Michael Schumacher's Ferrari chewing on its dust. Then again, Schumacher's Ferrari can go round corners, and that's not something that dragsters are entirely comfortable with. Just as problems with staircases hampered the Daleks, so an inability to do bends has prevented the dragster from achieving global domination. </p> <p>Other performance aspects of the dragster that might cause concern for the private owner: the fact that you need to strip the engine after every quarter-of-a-mile run; the consumption figures (see adjacent box); and the need for parachutes in the deceleration phase. I don't know what kind of a driveway you've got, but that would certainly be a problem on ours. </p> <p>Anyway, let's start her up, shall we? I pull on the health and safety headphones, exchange a firm-jawed thumbs-up with Grumpy, and the pit crew fire the engine. The sensation is immediate, visceral and terrifying. The noise is two parts jet plane to seven parts Mot\u00f6rhead, with a sweet top note of pneumatic drill. The fumes are yellow and the consistency of tarpaulin; within seconds, they fill my eyes, causing me to weep copious tears. </p> <p>I've got my foot flat on the clutch, but the engine is fighting it, kicking back, trying to get away. The vibrations shake my chest and threaten briefly to liquidise several of my most cherished internal organs. But it doesn't last long. Two minutes or so later, the stationary engine check on blocks in the pit is completed, the engine is shut down, and I get out. </p> <p>You weren't expecting me to drive the thing, were you? We looked into it, but a) the insurance would have been prohibitive, and b) I would have killed people, starting with myself. That's as suming I didn't stall on the line, which, actually, was the most likely outcome. Holding one of these machines at the biting point requires the nerve of a fighter pilot and the legs of a boxer. </p> <p>I left the driving to Wilson. He's the European champion, after all. He's also 60 years old, so he's had time to build the necessary muscles and hone the required reflexes. The team director, Anthony Cohen, who owns American Car Imports - Britain's leading purveyor of top-spec American cars to Premiership footballers and anyone else who can afford them - told me that when he stood behind Wilson on the start-line, he felt like he was sending a man to the moon. </p> <p>I asked Wilson what went through his mind when he was nailing his dragster up the strip, but he pointed out that there wasn't much time for the mind to get involved. When it worked, it was simply \"a blast\" - the fastest five seconds of a man's life. </p> <p>Later, Wilson took the dragster out on to the track for real, for the final meeting of the European Championships, tearing up the strip in a deafening howl, for the pleasure of several thousand whooping petrolheads.

Diane von Furstenberg found hers in 1976, and has spent a good deal of the time since trying to break free of it. <p>The Diane von Furstenberg wrap dress, in slinky jersey and in endless colours and patterns, has become an instantly recognisable fashion icon, in the mould of the Chanel boucle jacket. It is worn by everyone from Cherie Blair to Jade Jagger. And yet each New York fashion week Von Furstenberg presents a catwalk show in which the wrap dress makes just a few token appearances. Although she could most certainly retire on the profits from her hit frock, she is determined not to be seen as a one-trick pony. </p> <p>The first piece of clothing the audience was presented with was an ordinary white cotton vest emblazoned with the slogan \"Vote\" - one was wrapped and beribboned on each seat, as Von Furstenberg's gift and message to the assembled company. </p> <p>Then, after the traditional half-hour wait, came a silken spaghetti strap dress in green-tinged leopard print and, shortly after, a strapless bustier in white cable knit and a selection of flimsy tops which looked to be made from knotted silk scarves. </p> <p>A jet-setter's palette of ideas followed: a beaded flapper-style dress in African colours, a bright pink sun dress with a Greek key motif, and a kaftan printed with the colours of a tropical sunset. </p> <p>Strapless shapes dominated, with the wrap dress relegated to a supporting role, its most notable appearance in the form of a white shirt dress with pockets and collars, with the wrap belt taking the form of a starchy bow at the back. </p> <p>Von Furstenberg shared her accolades with her design partner, Nathan Jenden.</p>",
  "<p>Recently floated advertising group M&amp;C Saatchi said today that consolidation in the industry was a good thing for independent agencies as they could offer clients a distinctive service.</p> <p>Chief executive David Kershaw said WPP's acquisition yesterday of the world's leading independent agency, Grey Global, posed no threat to smaller companies.</p> <p>\"We are delighted with it. The more consolidation there is the less choice there is for clients to go to independent agencies. We can only benefit as people get gobbled up.\"</p> <p>Asked if consolidation would one day affect M&amp;C Saatchi - whose founding directors between them control the company with stakes locked in for two years - Mr Kershaw said: \"We are very happy swimming along. We do not see ourselves as potential gobblees.\"</p> <p>\"I think there's room for us [to grow]. As [smaller companies] flourish, the gobblers tend to do what they do.\"</p> <p>He said the company's smaller scale - it has a market capitalisation of \u00a373m compared with WPP's \u00a35.9bn - meant there was no inconsistency between its operations.</p> <p>\"Every office can be creatively excellent, can be profitable... there's a real market position to be had and I can't see any fundamental economic benefits to being part of a consolidated group.</p> <p>\"There's no reason why independent agencies can't operate with the same margins as consolidated groups.\"</p> <p>M&amp;C Saatchi's reinvention as a small outfit with just 14 offices round the world is a far cry from its directors' former home, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, an advertising behemoth that rose in the 1970s and 80s to become the world's biggest.</p> <p>And whereas Saatchi &amp; Saatchi's went on a bumper acquisition spree - until an acrimonious break-up in 1995 that saw the agency absorbed into French group Publicis and the Saatchi brothers breaking away to found M&amp;C Saatchi - its successor's strategy is to pursue start-ups and grow businesses organically.</p> <p>In July this year the company decided on a flotation to raise funds for an expansion into continental Europe.</p> <p>Today the company announced its first interim results as a public company, reporting pre-tax profit of \u00a34m in the first half of the year, up 8.8% on a year earlier.</p> <p>Revenues - about 60% of which comes from the UK - were up 10% between January and June, to \u00a329.8m.</p> <p>The company is focusing on expanding its offices, with two major European offices due to be opened in 2005 and a parallel project to open more Asian bureaux under way.</p> <p>Mr Kershaw said that between two-thirds and three-quarters of the \u00a37.5m raised from the company's flotation would be sued to spearhead the push into Europe. </p> <p>The new offices in Asia - where M&amp;C Saatchi already has seven bases - will be smaller and less \"capital-hungry\" than their European counterparts, Mr Kershaw said.</p> <p>The company has started to recruit local talent in Europe and plans to incentivise staff by giving them a 20% stake in the local agencies.</p> <p>Shares in the company rose by 1.9% this morning to 134p, valuing the company at \u00a372.6m.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "<p>Britain's inflation rate dropped to 1.3% in August as lower clothing prices helped to keep it well below the Bank of England's target, official figures showed today.</p> <p>The cost of both adults' and children's clothing recovered more slowly from the summer sales than it had done last year, contributing to a 0.1% fall in the consumer prices index (CPI) from July, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported.</p> <p>Lower prices of toys, computer games and consoles also helped push down inflation, the ONS said. The fall in the inflation rate was in line with market forecasts, although the Bank of England recently said inflation would rise in the coming months to meet the government's target of 2% in two years time. </p> <p>Other downward pressure came from food - mainly vegetables - as a result of significantly increased sales during last year's hot summer. Upward pressure came from the cost of housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels as the price of heating oil increased. The CPI, which differs from the old measure of retail price inflation (RPI) because it does not include housing and council tax costs, had last been lower in April, when the annual rate fell to 1.2%. </p> <p>Although consumer prices remained muted, the ONS yesterday reported that the price of goods leaving factories had again climbed last month, driven by rising world commodity increases. </p> <p>Analysts said the sharp rise in core producer output price inflation last month highlighted the dangers from above-trend growth, a tight labour market and strong oil and commodity prices.</p> <p>\"Consequently, we do not believe that the Bank of England's work is done yet, despite the growing evidence of a slowdown in the housing market and consumer price inflation of just 1.3% in August,\" Howard Archer, an economist with consultancy Global Insight, said. </p> <p>\"We continue to expect a 25 basis point hike in interest rates in November to 5%, and a further rise to 5.25% around next March.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>Q</strong> I've been living and working in London for the last six years in digital marketing. I now find that I'm a bit of an expert but in a very specialised field which ties me to London. I'm working for the best company in my field so there's no other company I'd like to work for, but I find it very unrewarding working in an office environment being tied to my desk. </p> <p>What's more, I'm really bored of the London lifestyle which is why I bought a house by the seaside earlier this year. This way I have a retreat at the weekends and by renting out the spare rooms I have my mortgage covered by rent money. The problem is that I'm finding living in London during the week harder and harder as I'd much prefer to be in my lovely house and not in my rented flat in the City.</p> <p>The ideal I guess in the short-term would be to have a couple of days per week working from home, but I don't think my boss would allow it. In terms of overall direction, I always thought I'd work in government, I spent five years studying it and current affairs/social policy is where I'd like to be, but I've got no idea if I could switch at my grand old age of 29.</p> <p> <strong>A</strong> Your presentation begs the question that if you are keen to work in government and have spent five years studying politics, what are you doing in digital marketing? </p> <p>That said , you are not alone in re-evaluating your options and life-style. Dr Johnson's view that when a man is tired of London, he is tired of life doesn't really hold these days, with its expensive and barely reliable transport system, daily car tax and sky-high property prices. Nevertheless there are many people who would envy your situation of living and working in London and also owning a decent weekend retreat. </p> <p>As your current employer is reluctant to let you work from your home by the sea, I would capitalise on your knowledge and expertise in digital marketing and consider taking the plunge into the world of self-employment, perhaps as an independent, freelance marketing consultant. </p> <p>This will give you the chance to live by the sea and save your rent money on the London flat. But tread carefully! Do not give up your current job yet; use your spare time to research the different options of becoming self-employed. The great news is that there is ever increasing support and advice for those who want to start a business of their own, and what's more, age is no barrier. </p> <p>For a start, check out the useful kit produced by <a href=\"http://www.lawpack.co.uk/\"> Lawpack</a>, the country's leading publisher of self-help books for home and business. This Kit provides a framework for those who are keen to become self-employed as 'sole traders'. It has useful advice on dealing with the requirements and day-to-day practicalities of self-employment, with template documents for organising and preparing accounts. </p> <p>The contents include; basics of self-employment, sources of finance, whom to contact about your plans, cash flow and budgets, keeping records for income tax and VAT and understanding accounts. The material is produced by Hugh Williams, a chartered accountant who started his own accountancy practice in 1973. The address is LawPack, 76-89 Alscot Road, London, SE1 3AW. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.entrepreneursuk.com/\">EntrepreneursUK</a> is an online service that provides help to build businesses for an annual membership fee. There are three practical services aimed at budding entrepreneurs. Its essential guide to earning a living from independent consultancy includes updates and access to the authors.

The library is broken up into separate categories such as regulations and legislation; entrepreneurial skills; business types; finance and grants; business opportunities; buying a business; winning more customers; managing your business; bringing in the experts. </p> <p>Finally if after your research you are truly, madly and deeply keen to go it alone it may be prudent to spend a couple of hundred pounds to assess whether you have the personality, resilience and sense of adventure to pull it off. You will have to cope with a new exciting working lifestyle that has lots of uncertainties so it is important to make sure that this is the right thing for you, and for the other significant people in your life. </p> <p>That is where <a href=\"http://www.careerenergy.co.uk/\"> Career Energy,</a> the UK's leading people-and-work consultancy comes in.

  "<p>Welcome to the Wrap, Guardian Unlimited's round-up of the best of the day's papers.</p> <p>Also in today's Wrap: Kremlin tightens grip, Blair speaks to TUC conference, and Spanish police halt 'Cannonball Run Europe'</p> <p><strong>BATMAN PROTESTER BREACHES PALACE SECURITY</strong></p> <p>\"Holey security, batman!\" The Sun takes the laurels for the most succinctly witty response to the news that a man dressed as Batman yesterday appeared on a ledge at Buckingham Palace, making a protest for Fathers for Justice. The group, which says fathers get a poor deal when couples split up, has previously exposed security failings at the House of Commons by throwing purple powder at the prime minister (or perhaps the chancellor - you never know these days).</p> <p>Most of the other papers circle around what, in hindsight, is the obvious joke. The Times manages \"Holy breach of security,\" and the Mirror has \"Batma'am\" - but the Mail and Express are bursting veins with rage. What, asks the Mail, if it had been al-Qaida? What, asks the Express, if it had been a suicide bomber? The Express gives Fathers for Justice the traditional media treatment of superheroes, describing them as \"a public menace\", but the Mail finds room for a sympathetic word, running a piece by a female writer on what motivates them. </p> <p>The Guardian helpfully provides a graphic of how the man got on to the ledge which, incidentally, shows how quickly police reacted: they had nabbed Batman's accomplice (Robin, since you ask) before he got into the palace grounds.</p> <p>Oddly, the most entertaining and reflective commentary is to be found buried at the end of the FT's Notebook column. \"The fabulous image of a chubby Batman waving to the crowds,\" it says, perhaps shows that Palace guards \"were only looking out for people dressed as Osama bin Laden ... We should at least be thankful that al-Qaida lacks the logistical capabilities of a bunch of disgruntled dads in superhero costumes, otherwise there would be precious little of London left standing.\"</p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/monarchy/story/0,2763,1304115,00.html\">Protesters breach royal security</a></p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2-2004423137,00.html\">Sun: Holey security Batman!</a></p> <p>* <a href=\"http://news.ft.com/cms/s/42b0114c-05ed-11d9-bff2-00000e2511c8.html\">FT: Father of terror</a></p> <p><strong>PUTIN TIGHTENS GRIP</strong> </p> <p>\"President Vladimir Putin yesterday took a chainsaw to the fragile roots of Russian democracy,\" says the FT in an impassioned leader in response to Mr Putin's proposed sweeping overhaul of the country's political system. </p> <p>The changes, which will give the Kremlin greater power than at any time since the fall of the Soviet Union, are \"simply exploiting the Beslan massacre to seize new powers for the Kremlin,\" the paper continues, warning that \"fear of the Kremlin stalks the streets once more\". Under the proposals, the country's 89 regional governors would be nominated by the president, bringing an end to regional elections, and seats in the Duma would be brought under fully proportional system - a move that would give Mr Putin's party, United Russia, even greater control. </p> <p>A \"return to the USSR\" is the consensus of the leader writers - for the Telegraph, the reforms \"are the depressingly predictable reactions of a man who came to power as the strongman of Chechnya and is using the latest terrorist outrage to boost the Kremlin's already formidable authority\". The Herald Tribune remarks that \"across the short spectrum of political opposition in today's Russia, reactions ranged from stunned disbelief to helpless anger\".</p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/russia/article/0,2763,1303957,00.html\">Putin tightens grip on regions and MPs</a></p> <p>* <a href=\"http://news.ft.com/cms/s/2a5a43ee-05eb-11d9-bff2-00000e2511c8.html\">FT: Putin power</a></p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2004/09/14/dl1402.xml&amp;sSheet=/news/2004/09/14/ixnewstop.html\">Telegraph: More power to Putin</a></p> <p><strong>BLAIR GIVES 'LUKEWARM' SPEECH TO TUC</strong></p> <p>One can feel the agony of the sketchwriters today. After Tony Blair's speech to the TUC conference yesterday was built up as the first salvo in the Labour party's civil war, it turned out to be neither combative enough to be an attack nor sufficiently badly received to be considered a mauling. Indeed, it is largely pushed off the front pages by the antics of our chubby superhero.</p> <p>In the Times, Ann Treneman - who spends one fifth of her sketch discussing the Brighton weather - concentrates on Mr Blair's delivery. \"His introduction was extraordinary, but in the wrong way, for it was as flat as you can get. It did not even make it to pancake levels ... Towards the end, when he should have been building up to a barnstormer of an ending, Mr Blair managed to become even more lukewarm. 'To people at work, wondering whether membership of a trade union has anything to offer them, I would say: go and see'.\"</p> <p>Simon Hoggart in the Guardian is in similar straits, but is watching the reception. \"It wasn't aggressive silence, a collective dumb insolence. Neither was it hostile, like the Tory front bench or the women's institute. It was just - silence.\"</p> <p>But the flavour of the event (and it seems there was little enough) is perhaps best captured by Andrew Gimson in the Telegraph, who compares Mr Blair to a successful man being obliged to visit unfashionable relatives. \"Frankly,\" he says, \"it is a relief to both sides when these painful encounters are over.\"</p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardianpolitics/story/0,,1303985,00.html\">All quiet on the union front</a></p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1261240,00.html\">Times: Off-colour Tony fails to warm the comrades</a></p> <p><strong>CLARKE PLANS UNIVERSITY ADMISSIONS SHAKE-UP</strong></p> <p>Deprived of their battle in Brighton, the papers look elsewhere. The Telegraph reports plans by the education secretary, Charles Clarke, to change the university admissions procedure so it happens after students receive their A-level results and not, as is currently the case, before. Mr Clarke describes \"post qualification application\" - PQA - as a \"holy grail\" which has always been seen as desirable, but not achievable. An analysis piece says the changes will also include changes to favour applicants from poorer backgrounds. </p> <p>A leader in the Times mostly applauds the former idea, but laments the latter. It says there is a failure \"to take account of the longer-term consequences of 'positive discrimination',\" adding: \"Mr Clarke's true holy grail should be to eliminate the need for it.\" </p> <p>The Independent runs one of its bullet-point front pages, assessing the prime minister's environmental record ahead of a speech today, in which it says he will demand that the US ratify the Kyoto treaty.</p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/09/14/nedu14.xml\">Telegraph: Radical shake-up in entry to college</a></p> <p>* <a href=\"http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/environment/story.jsp?story=561463\">Independent: How green is our PM?</a></p> <p><strong>'I WANTED TO BE INVISIBLE'</strong></p> <p>\"Helicopters were firing at us.

Abdul-Ahad, who was injured, describes the last moments of some of the 13 Iraqis killed in the attack. \"There in the street, the injured were all left alone: a young man with blood all over his face sat in the middle of the cloud of dust, then fell on to his face.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile, the Herald Tribune says the US \"get-tough approach is showing signs of backfiring\" as the attacks of the insurgents \"grow more brazen and sophisticated\" and \"inside the grim and chaotic wards of Baghdad's hospitals Sunday, the Americans seemed to have won more enemies than friends\".</p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Iraq/Story/0,2763,1303827,00.html\">One morning in Baghdad</a></p> <p><strong>BARRETT HAD 'APPETITE FOR MURDER'</strong></p> <p>\"He was the most sinister man I ever met,\" a policeman tells the Times, describing Kenneth Barrett, who yesterday pleaded guilty to the murder of the Belfast solicitor Pat Finucane. \"When you spoke to him, you knew you were in the presence of pure evil.\" </p> <p>The paper says Barrett \"distinguished himself by his sheer appetite for murder\", but adds that he is unlikely to serve more than two years if he can prove he is no longer an \"active terrorist\".</p> <p>Writing in the Guardian, Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams says that the government must now launch a public inquiry into allegations that Mr Finucane - a Republican with several IRA members as clients - was murdered with the collusion of the British authorities.</p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Northern_Ireland/Story/0,2763,1303974,00.html\">Don't dodge the issue of collusion</a></p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1261213,00.html\">Times: An evil appetite for murder</a></p> <p><strong>SONY REACHES MGM AGREEMENT</strong></p> <p>As the Times puts it, \"James Bond fell into Japanese hands last night\" with the news that Sony has reached a preliminary agreement to buy MGM, the struggling Hollywood studio, for around $4.8bn (\u00a32.6bn). </p> <p>Previous frontrunner Time Warner pulled out at midnight yesterday after Sony increased its bid to $12 a share.

  "<p>The focus in the advertising world yesterday was on WPP as it agreed a $1.3bn (\u00a3727m) takeover of American advertising group Grey Global. But the eyes of the financial community could soon switch to one of the losers in the auction - French group Havas. </p> <p>Despite attempts to assert itself as a predator in a highly acquisitive sector, the world's sixth largest advertising group is now seen in some quarters as prey following WPP's victory. </p> <p>Sir Martin Sorrell, the chief executive of WPP, pointed out yesterday that the industry's \"middle ground\" is a difficult place to be, and the number of companies sitting in that awkward spot is dwindling. </p> <p>By taking out Grey Global, the world's seventh largest advertising group, WPP has blocked Havas's best chance of promotion to the top tier. When the deal is completed WPP will take the mantle as the sector's biggest group from Omnicom. Sir Martin's apparent nonchalance at paying $1.3bn for a major advertising group must have been all the more frustrating for Havas executives. </p> <p>\"Was it a 'must have'? Probably not, but I think it's a good business, has talented people, good operating companies and brands. I think we can make something of it,\" said Sir Martin. </p> <p>He said later that WPP approached Havas 18 months ago regarding taking a stake in its media planning group unit, but it was \"probably wrong\" to focus on Havas after acquiring Grey. </p> <p>But there was at least one silver lining for Havas, a company that announced its third restructuring in three years in 2003. Sir Martin admitted winning the Grey auction was the \"easy part\", with Grey's margins coming in at a worse than expected 5.8% last year. </p> <p>Despite a slowdown in corporate activity during a three-year global advertising recession, the inexorable trend in the advertising world has been towards constructing huge advertising and media services groups. They can offer a one-stop shop for clients. </p> <p>Havas, which is undergoing a restructuring programme, was not only bidding for Grey but also for a place in the big league with WPP, Omnicom, Publicis and Interpublic. With Grey gone to WPP, the middle ground in the advertising sector comprises Havas and Aegis, the global media buying group. </p> <p>The sight of banking group HSBC awarding its global marketing account to WPP earlier this year was a deflating one for Havas. The \u00a3340m deal went to WPP because it offered what Havas could not: globe-spanning marketing services. Havas's clients include Air France and Orange, and its Euro RSCG produces impressive work, but its market capitalisation of \u20ac1.3bn (\u00a3890m) is on a par with Grey's. </p> <p>Havas's courtship of Grey has been loudly criticised by dissident investor Vincent Bollore, who has built a stake of more than 10% in the company and welcomed Havas's failure at the auction. Sir Martin issued an oblique warning to Alain de Pouzilhac, Havas's chief executive, over Mr Bollore. \"Bollore has got about 11% of the company, I understand, and under French rules he has to make some sort of statement about what his intentions are. I would not want to get on the wrong side of Vincent Bollore,\" he said. </p> <p>Analysts at UBS Warburg said Havas was right to approach Grey in search of a greater role as a global advertising group, but a takeover would have been a stretch too far for its finances. The French group's room for manoeuvre is restricted by a \u20ac666m (\u00a3455m) convertible bond issue which matures in 2006, although Havas has indicated it may be able to refinance the debt. </p> <p>Mr de Pouzilhac said Havas had put together a \"competitive bid\" with the backing of Deutsche Bank and investment bank Calyon, but topping WPP's offer would have compromised the restructuring programme. </p> <p>One argument against consolidation, admittedly of minimal consolation for Havas, is the creation of potential conflicts of interest. Critics of the WPP's bid for Grey cited it as a prime example of how global advertising firms could be compromising the quality of their output by retaining clients who are in direct competition with each other. One of its largest clients is consumer goods group Unilever, while Grey's biggest customer is Procter &amp; Gamble, Unilever's biggest rival. </p> <p>The Chinese walls within WPP are sturdy enough to handle the Grey deal, according to a Unilever spokesperson: \"We are fairly sanguine about the whole thing.\" </p> <p>Doug Flynn, the chief executive of Aegis, whose future as an independent company is regularly called into question, dismissed the consolidation trend. He pointed out that the biggest organic revenue growth in the advertising and marketing sector over the past two years has come from two independents: Aegis and Omnicom. </p> <p>\"It's really a Sorrell trend. If you look at the companies that have made great acquisitions they have come unglued. Cordiant, Interpublic and Havas made big acquisitions and came unglued. WPP nearly went bankrupt through its own acquisitions in the early 1990s,\" he said. </p> <p>\"You have got to ask what's in it for the client - and it's sod all,\" he added.</p>",
  "Michael Howard laid out a series of measures to get Britain's climate change policy back on track yesterday and attacked the government's failure at home and Tony Blair's inability to influence George Bush on the issue. <p>In a speech praised by the normally hostile green lobby, he made great play of improving household energy efficiency and encouraging technologies such as wave and tidal power. </p> <p>He proposed removing or reducing the stamp duty on house sales - \u00a38,000 on average - for energy-efficient premises. Those who had paid could claim the benefit when they fitted the appropriate equipment. </p> <p>He stressed the role of the Conservatives, particularly that of Lady Thatcher, in alerting the world to the danger of global warming in the 1980s, and the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions which resulted from the the 1990s switch to gas. </p> <p>Aware that the prime minister is due to speak on the same subject today, he attacked Tony Blair's \"failure to follow up bold rhetoric with action that inspires trust\". </p> <p>He accused Mr Blair of lecturing people while presiding over rising emissions and failing to have a coherent plan for achieving his \"ambitious long term targets for carbon dioxide emissions\". </p> <p>Addressing a conference organised by the Green Alliance, he made no mention of nuclear power, and when challenged afterwards said it was a matter for a Conservative government to decide when in office. </p> <p>The issue was how to ensure security of electricity supply, he said; at this point it was impossible to know what would happen. </p> <p>He was ambivalent about on-shore wind power, saying it had its place in the energy mix. But he accused the government of ignoring opposition from local communities: its new guidelines requiring local authorities to meet targets for renewable energy would bring more on-shore wind farms which Tories would oppose. </p> <p>The government had failed to support other renewables, with all their potential for creating jobs and industries. The Department of Trade and Industry consistently failed to supported wind, wave and biomass technologies beyond the invention stage. </p> <p>Lack of energy efficiency measures and failure to support combined heat and power schemes were two of the government's greatest failures. </p> <p>The average German home was four times as energy efficient as a British one. </p> <p>Guy Thompson, the Green Alliance's director, said he was glad that Mr Howard had chosen to focus on climate change rather than traditional Tory subjects such as agriculture and the countryside. </p> <p>\"We need strong opposition on the environment to hold the government to account,\" he said. \"In view of declining party allegiances, the Conservatives should be going after the votes of the 5 million members of green NGOs at the next election.\" </p> <p>Tony Juniper, director of Friends of the Earth, welcomed the speech and said it had \"set a high bar for the prime minister to jump over\" in his own green speech today. \"We will be looking for some action at last from Mr Blair,\" he said </p> <p>Greenpeace chose yesterday to publish a poll showing that 80% of the public support government plans to increase the number of wind turbines, despite a well orchestrated campaign against them. </p> <p>Its campaigner Jim Footner said: \"This was a good speech with some good ideas, and Michael Howard is right when he says Bush should sign the Kyoto Protocol, but on the ground his party is a serious impediment in the fight against global warming. </p> <p>\"Conservative politicians have tried to scupper wind energy projects across the country, while Mr Howard himself has shared a platform with prominent anti-wind campaigners like David Bellamy, who denies global warming is even real.\" </p> <p>The environment secretary, Margaret Beckett, said: \"Michael Howard's hypocrisy beggars belief. </p> <p>\"Howard opposes the climate change levy and Labour's renewable programme. </p> <p>\"He will not sign up to our goal of reducing emissions by 60% by 2050. </p> <p>\"If he wants to adopt a leadership position on climate change, he could start by supporting some of Labour's most successful policies for tackling climate change.\"</p>",
  "What every woman allegedly really, really wants - apart, that is, from a size 10 figure, Jennifer Lopez's backside and the face of a wrinkle-free angel - is a baby or three. So how come the average number born to British females has fallen by a third in the past 30 years from 2.4 to 1.65? Why is it that an unprecedented one in four women is likely to remain childfree? <p>New research has apparently revealed that one of the main causes for this plunge in the population is the demise of the close-knit extended family. A couple is no longer able to call on this support network for cost-free childcare. </p> <p>In addition, granny and other relatives who traditionally acted as cheerleaders in the fertility Olympics, spurring on the conception of the first child (\"You don't want to leave it too late, do you, dear ...?\") are voices that are now literally much more distant. </p> <p>\"Our findings suggest that the more contact there is between kin, the more couples are urged to have children and pass on the family genes,\" Dr Lesley Newson told a British Psychological Society conference recently. \"All this urging creates social norms which value motherhood ...\" </p> <p>He and researchers from the University of Exeter looked at population trends across a number of western countries. They concluded that the major change was the scattering of the extended family across a wider geographical area than ever before. </p> <p>One of the problems with this is the assumption that a high proportion of childcare is still carried out by one's nearest and dearest, and therefore cheapest. Hardly mentioned in the latest scare about the quality of nursery care, for example, is the fact that only 18% of mothers with children under two work full-time, and half of those leave their child with family or friends. </p> <p>Anyway, population crises are nothing new. Contrary to the myth that motherhood is every female's dream, many are hugely ambivalent. This may manifest itself in a failure to attach to a child, discussed by Madeleine Bunting in these pages yesterday as an urgent contemporary problem, though it has long existed, albeit better camouflaged. If society demands too high a sacrifice in the name of parenthood or places obstacles in the way, ambivalence rapidly transmutes into resistance. </p> <p>In the late 1940s, for instance, the only child, \"the solitary ewe lamb\", was deemed a thing to deplore because he or she was increasingly common. Women, accustomed to nurseries and independence in the war years, were unwilling to produce copiously. A royal commission on population was set up and a family allowance established giving five shillings for every child after the first. </p> <p> Other ideas included rest homes for tired housewives and official neighbourhood babysitters. What actually did the trick in the end was the consumer boom. Men worked while women had spend-a-lot babies. </p> <p>Now, reproductive resistance is more complex. Most families need a wage and a half. Yet parents, in spite of some improvements, are still expected to be seen but not heard in public policy and the workplace. A radical change has yet to occur. </p> <p>What the government offers, instead, is long hours and access to professional childcare. What the average man and woman wants is a cut in the working day, fewer antisocial shifts and greater understanding of the way the family ought to weave into careers. </p> <p>According to research published by the Equal Opportunities Commission last week, more than a third of employers believe that pregnancy is \"an undue cost burden\". A thousand women a year take legal action after being sacked because they are pregnant. </p> <p>\"Others face pay cuts, demotion, hostile treatment or are made to work in an unsafe environment. The impact on these women's lives and the health and safety of the baby can be disastrous,\" says Julie Mellor, the commission's chairwoman. In that context, many women aren't so much turning away from motherhood - as discovering they have lost the option. </p> <p>In the past, couples married in their early 20s and had a baby a couple of years later - because that's what people did. Now, control rules. Medical advances and contraception peddle the illusion that it's possible to choose the \"right\" time - determined, for some, by career advance ment and material satisfaction. But then, when the magic moment arrives, nature refuses to comply - and it's bye, bye baby. </p> <p>If the aim is to stem the population decline - not least to create work slaves for our old age - then restitching the extended family is unrealistic and no cure. Instead, we need a statutory code of practice to protect employed pregnant women; more support for parents; a cultural shift in the workplace and a halt to the media's constant portrayal of babies as nothing but trouble - sabotaging sanity, careers, marriages and solvency. In spite of present terms and conditions, that's still only a tiny fraction of the truth. </p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b>Yvonne Roberts's latest novel, Shake!, is published by Headline </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:yroberts@dial.pipex.com\">yroberts@dial.pipex.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Low-cost airlines warned yesterday that the industry is heading for an \"awful\" winter and new year - which will, however, delight consumers.</p> <p>Ryanair says fares have dropped by some 5% during the first half of the year but could fall nearly 20% by the end of 2004.</p> <p>EasyJet says it is steeled for \"difficult times\" ahead, which could last between six and 18 months.</p> <p>\"It's going to be awful out there. There are going to be continuing fare wars in 2005,\" said Ryanair founder and chief executive Michael O'Leary.</p> <p>Speaking at a UBS transport conference in London, Mr O'Leary said average fares would fall to the further end of its 10%-20% forecast range in the second half of this year.</p> <p>\"Yield [average fare] declines in H1 [the first half] now look like they are at the lower end of our 5% to 10% range,\" he said.</p> <p>Despite the gloom, Ryanair's boss said his company would still meet its targets of full year after-tax profits up 20%.</p> <p>EasyJet warned it would pull out of more airports if landing charges and other rates were not kept at sensible levels.</p> <p>The airline founded by Greek shipping tycoon, Stelios Haji-Ioannou, recently announced plans to quit Zurich. \"If you have airports which are charging stupid prices, you will see us withdraw,\" said easyJet financial director Chris Walton.</p> <p>The results of a review of the company's growth rate, deployment of aircraft and route network, would be announced within weeks, he added.</p> <p>But a downgrading of expansion plans is now expected. \"It will be a very hard winter, and that will last for some time,\" said Mr Walton.</p> <p>\"Whether it is six or 18 months, we are looking at a very difficult time,\" he added. </p> <p>Despite this, easyJet is still watching for opportunities arising out of the financial troubles at Alitalia, which could lead to Italian routes becoming available.</p> <p>The gloomy forecasts come as Europe sees a continuing expansion of capacity with new airlines starting up.</p> <p>EU Jet - formed by a property developer and an ex-Ryanair executive - is the latest to start services from Manston in Kent. Wizz Air of Poland, Sky Europe in Hungary and Air Berlin in Germany are among the new generation of firms.</p> <p>Chris Avery, an airline analyst at JP Morgan, believes Mr O'Leary's bleak forecasts are primarily aimed at scaring off market entrants.</p> <p>\"My view is that Ryanair's bottom end [minus 20%] yield forecasts are for competitor consumption rather than for analyst modelling.</p> <p>\"I would be surprised if it turns out that bad...but then I have been surprised before,\" said Mr Avery. </p> <p>The other problem facing airlines has been rising fuel costs. Most of them have hedges in place to avoid the worst impact of $50 per barrel oil prices but Mr O'Leary said he was confident the global price would decline to $30 by next summer.</p> <p>Its not just the low-cost players that are being brought down. British Airways has been hit hard by rising compe tition and last week announced plans to reduce its \u00a35.6bn debt mountain with the sale of its stake in Qantas of Australia.</p> <p>Other traditional European carriers are looking for ways to compete. Air France and KLM of the Netherlands recently merged to reduce costs and improve profitability.</p>",
  "<p>A powerful grouping of charities, non-governmental organisations and trades unions is today calling on Tony Blair to spearhead a drive next year to eradicate global poverty. </p> <p>The Make Poverty History coalition plans to emulate the success of the Jubilee 2000 debt relief campaign. Calling for a radical shake-up of world trade rules and increased flows of aid to poor countries, the coalition said Britain should use its joint presidencies of the European Union and G8 to kick-start stalled progress towards the goal of halving world poverty by 2015. </p> <p>This would put increased pressure for change on the EU's common agricultural policy as well as the export subsidies enjoyed by rich American farmers. </p> <p>It aims to be the most powerful coalition ever against poverty and calls for urgent action. It is \"looking to Tony Blair to improve the lives of millions of poor people around the world, who have to live on less than a dollar a day\". </p> <p>U2 lead singer and veteran debt relief campaigner Bono added: \"The year 2005 is our chance to go down in history for what we did do rather than what we didn't. This campaign is critical and is coming to a stadium and pulpit near you.\" </p> <p>The group said poverty is killing 30,000 people around the world every day. Billions do not have access to clean water and millions are dying of HIV/Aids. </p> <p>It sees 2005 as a crucial time to put pressure on world leaders through the Labour government, which has been a key backer of initiatives to tackle poverty. Mr Blair's Commission for Africa reports in April while Britain holds the presidency of the Group of Eight rich nations and the European Union next year. Next year also sees the 20th anniversary of Live Aid in July. </p> <p>\"[This] is a year of great opportunity. We can really do something to change the world . If everyone wanting to see an end to poverty, hunger and suffering speaks out, the noise will be deafening. Politicians will have to listen,\" said Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa. </p> <p>The world's rich countries agreed a set of millennium development goals four years ago with the target of halving world poverty by 2015. But campaigners and experts say far more action and commitment are needed by governments if the date has any hope of being met. </p> <p>\"For too long trade justice, debt and aid have been discussed but left on the 'too difficult to deal with' pile. 2005 is a unique opportunity. That's why the unions are joining with faith groups, charities and campaigning groups to urge everyone to take action to make history,\" said TUC general secretary Brendan Barber. </p> <p>The group said it would organise a human chain at the G8 summit in Edinburgh next July similar to the one at the last G8 summit in Britain, in Birmingham in 1998. </p> <p>In the area of trade, the group will fight for rules which ensure governments, particularly in poor countries, can choose the best solutions to end poverty and protect the environment. It will also push for an end to export subsidies for rich countries' farmers. </p> <p>It will campaign for further and faster debt relief for poor countries, building on the work already done and supported by Gordon Brown. Many countries are still spending more on repaying debt than meeting the needs of their people. </p> <p>On aid, it will push for all western nations to provide 0.7% of their national income in aid and make aid work more effectively for poor people.
