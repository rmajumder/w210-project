  "Country types like to have a laugh at urbanites who move to the countryside and complain about the smell and noise - clanging church bells, power-mooing cows, roary tractors. But the dominant noise you hear in the English countryside is not, and never has been, any of these. It is the steady, unwavering, nerve-shredding noise of bleating. Not the relatively relaxing, chilled-out bleat of sheep, but the incessant, much harder to ignore bleat of that never-knowingly-satisfied figure, the English Countryman. <p>Of the several clever things done by the Countryside Alliance, the most astute was the way in which it harnessed this general sense of grievance for its single issue. Foxhunting is not a popular cause anywhere in the UK, and it isn't much more popular in the countryside, where class differences are at least as sharp, and as full of resentment, as they are in town. But one thing almost everyone in the country has, in addition to their specific grievances - phone masts, bypasses, closing post-offices - is a vivid feeling of being generally hard done by. The Countryside Alliance has drawn on that hard-done-by-ness with great skill. </p> <p>Outsiders, however, find the bleating hard to understand. If you, like me, are one of the 71.5% of Britons who lives in an urban environment, then you may find yourself wondering exactly what it is that countrysiders are moaning about. After all, one of the most robust indicators of how satisfactory a place is to live is whether or not people want to go and live there. In France, for instance, rural life is so quiet and so boring that there has been, for generations, a consistent pattern of internal migration from the country to the town. This is the general pattern across the developed world: people go to live in cities because they have better lives there. Not in Britain, though. For 2002, the last year in which there were accurate figures, a net 115,400 people moved out of urban environments into the countryside. In other words, every year a city slightly bigger then Exeter disappears, and reappears wearing green wellies and complaining about the bypass. This has been going on for a decade and a half. Why? Perhaps it has something to do with the fact that people in the countryside have a relatively higher standard of living, better health care, better schools, and live longer. So what's with all this complaining? </p> <p>My own feelings about the English countryside were shaped by the contrast between them and the Far East, where I grew up. We moved to rural Norfolk from Hong Kong, which at that point was the most crowded city in the world. Compared to that, Norfolk was a paradise of space and light and fresh air. Our house was near the Broads, and I would go out in a canoe to explore the network of dykes and rivers almost every day. There was a kingfisher who lived near where I hid the canoe, and the electric-blue shock of his underbelly, so startling among the greens and greys of the reeds, was, every time I saw it, the high point of my day. As a city boy, I had not known that any natural phenomenon could be the high point of a day. A pair of bitterns lived in the marsh, and during the spring you could hear the male's astonishing foghorn boom from, literally, miles away. I thought about taking up birdwatching, but gave up after one afternoon, during which I counted 47 house sparrows. </p> <p>The most exotic of the local fauna was the coypu. A coypu is a 2ft-long \u00fcber-rat with-and this is the clincher - red-orange teeth. They are a rodent cross between Arnold Schwarzennegger and Dracula. At night they used to break in to our vegetable patch (which we had fenced to keep them out) and make terrifying howling sounds, a cross between cats in a sack and hungry human babies. Cool! That was part of the magic of Norfolk, that it had real wild nature in it. Hong Kong was a place of convulsive change, where familiar landmarks would disappear overnight; rural Norfolk seemed calm, stable, and permanent. </p> <p>I was dead wrong about all that. Twenty-plus years later, Britain's coypus are extinct: they were exterminated by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food because of the damage they did to riverbanks. Bitterns are down to their last 50-odd breeding pairs; I spoke to a birdwatcher who said he hadn't heard one in 10 years. Last week, house sparrows were put on the endangered species list; their population has declined by 62% in 25 years, and nobody knows why. The fact that the Broads look more or less the same disguises marked and sudden ecological changes. </p> <p>What I didn't know was the the Broads were not, and never had been, a wild place. Their very existence is the legacy of human actions, from medieval peat diggings. That is typical of the British countryside. There is no nature left in this country. Nothing here is untouched: since the great bronze-age deforestation, man has made his mark everywhere in these islands. Even our greatest, most beautiful landscapes, the Lake District or the Yorkshire Dales, are man-made, created by deforestation and agriculture. (In fact, part of the beauty of England's great landscapes, in the north or in the west, is their human scale, their intimacy: we have no Alps here, let alone any Grand Canyons. Our landscapes don't make us feel small.) Everything in Britain is the product of a choice. So the first thing we have to do when thinking about the countryside is accept that there is no nature here, only culture: only things that we have made and chosen. The way our countryside looks, and the ways we live in it, are products of our choices, and we must let go of any fantasies about nature and timelessness and stasis. We must choose the countryside we want. We have to ask, what is the countryside for? </p> <p>Some of this choosing is simple - not always easy to execute, but simple. We want our beautiful \"nature\" spots kept the way they are, so we turn them into national parks. Running the national parks is not easy. There are 12 million visits a year to the Lake District alone; this wild, natural place needs a lot of managing if it is going to stay that way. But at least we can agree on that. We want our agreed beautiful places to stay as beautiful as possible, and that means we have to treat them as if they were in themselves a finite resource. </p> <p>That, unfortunately, is where the simple part of the choosing ends. For the rest, we have to face a paradox about the countryside, which is that there is a stark division between the land and the people who live on it. Of the 45 million habitable acres in Britain, 4 million is urban plot, and 41 million is agricultural land. But that agricultural land employs only 2% of the working population. So whom do you talk to when you want to talk about the countryside? If you want to talk about the 90% of our countryside which is given over to farmland, you have to talk to a farmer. But you have to bear in mind that farmers, while they represent the overwhelming majority of the land surface of our country, represent an almost invisible minority of the people who live here. </p> <p>They are increasingly aware of it, too. \"When I was growing up I thought people liked farmers,\" Steve Wilson, an arable farmer from mid-Norfolk, told me. \"My dad was a farmer, and, you know, there was this sense that people thought of farmers as a good thing. But over the last years that seems to have changed. You started hearing that farmers complained all the time, and that we get all these subsidies, and so on. And the coverage is all different now, it's hostile.\" Wilson produces more than his father did out of the large flat fields of their property. He is clearly prosperous, but, equally clearly, is stressed. He looks like a red-faced outdoors type, but when he talks about his work it is like hearing someone in a high-pressured City job. \"You have this fantasy of being allowed to just get on with it. But that's not what it's like at all.\" </p> <p>I asked around about this. It seems to be true: people who aren't directly involved in agriculture and old-type country life don't seem to have much love of people who are. Class politics exist in the country at least as much as in town. Some of this is to do with old ways versus new ways, or, more accurately, old money versus new. A man in a cravat, whispering, told me about pheasant shoots where \"nooves\" (his word) \"and rock stars\" kill a thousand birds in a day, so many that some of them are ploughed under rather than sold. \"I think it's wicked,\" said my informant. (In the countryside, posh people still use the word \"wicked\" to mean \"wicked\".) </p> <p>I told Wilson that the night before I spoke to him, I had been staying at a local pub, with comfy bedrooms and the disconcertingly good - and not cheap - food you increasingly find in England's pubs. The conversation was about a local farmer who was digging up a field and kept causing power cuts. \"You can tell he feels guilty,\" one of the locals said, \"because he stops and chats to people in the village. Not that he'd ever admit it.\" </p> <p>Wilson shrugged. \"Time was when farmers were the local community. Now, we're not.\" He waved around him at his farm office, which had the endemic scruffiness of farm back rooms. A VAT registration certificate was pinned to the wall next to a FHM Honeyz poster. \"We think of this as the main purpose of the countryside, but in lots of ways now it's not. We're more cut off.\" He told me that he couldn't go and drink in the pubs he liked as a young man because it is used by former farm-workers whom he had made redundant. </p> <p>So the answer to our question about \"what is the countryside for\", is, in practise, \"growing food\". But this is not what most of the people who live in the countryside do. Mark Miller, a schoolfriend of mine who moved back to Norfolk from a job in the City, took me on a drive round the village where he grew up. When I asked him why he had moved back, and cut his salary by more than 50%, he said, without missing a beat, \"quality of life\". </p> <p>\"But everyone who lives in the country seems to complain all the time\"' I said. He shrugged. \"Of course they do. People feel culturally invisible, they feel no one cares about them and no one knows anything about their lives. They feel modern Britain sees them as irrelevant. That's what they're really complaining about. But in straight quality of life terms, there's no question you're better off in the country.\" </p> <p>\"Most of the land around here is now consolidated in the hands of a single farmer,\" he went on. \"Out of a village population of a few hundred, only about 10 work on the land, and most of them work for other farmers. Mostly people are commuters who live in Norwich. One or two work from home.\" He listed the professions: some were in the service industry cutting hair or cleaning houses or teaching pilates. \"There's a self-employed businessman or two. There's a bloke who made a bomb trading shares online and then lost it in the tech crash. There's a village idiot and a village wife-beater and a couple who are supposed to be swingers. All the usual stuff.\" The village still has a shop and a primary school. One thing which there isn't locally is any foxhunting. There are no hunts near by and even if there were: \"The farmer wouldn't allow it.\" </p> <p>Who represents these people? What single body speaks for them? Well, nobody, really. They live in a rural setting, but, like most people who live in rural settings in Britain, their lives are economically tied to town. An increasing number of them live on the estates like the new one which had suddenly appeared on the way out to our old home from Norwich. This was a road I had taken perhaps a thousand times, in car and on foot, on bike and motorbike, drunk and sober, happy and sad, in every stage of teenage love and teenage dumpedness, and once walking my bike home on its back wheel seven miles at two in the morning because someone had nicked the front one. Turning off down the road on this visit, though, I had to stop because it no longer existed. A brand new, hideous housing estate was built right in the way. Large signs invited me to inspect a display house. If I hurried and bought a small one, I might have change from \u00a3200,000. The quiet road-to-nowhere to our village now involved me doubling back and taking a detour down a roaring dual carriageway. </p> <p>These semi-country estates are going to be more and more of a factor in country life. You can't help but wonder what they're going to be like to live on. Simon Pinker, now a hard-living London adman hitting 40, grew up on one, \"near Windsor if you wanted to sound like a nob, or in Bracknell if you were trying to sound tough\". He says that \"the main feeling you have, especially a teenager, is that life is happening to someone else\". Life in these places - which are exurban, really, to do with the spread of city into the country - is, according to him, dull. Once he had left to go to college, Pinker never lived at home again. \"They're great for young people, and great for old people, and incredibly boring for everybody in the middle. And it is essential that you drive, or have access to a car. On my estate, if you didn't pass your driving test at your first attempt, everybody assumed you were homosexual.\" </p> <p>These estates are changing the British countryside. Norfolk - sleepy, Alan Partridgesque Norfolk, famously preserved by the fact that it isn't on the way to anywhere - has 72,600 new houses in John Prescott's brilliant masterplan to cover the whole of south and eastern England with Barratt show-homes. That is a new city the size of Norwich, already the biggest city in the county by far. This won't involve convulsive, revolutionary change. Nothing dramatic will happen. It's just that life will be, in dozens of small ways, slightly worse: more people, more traffic, more noise, more pollution, more queuing, more time spent at the check-out, longer waiting times at the doctor and the den tist and the hospital, a tighter blast-area of selection by postcode around the good schools, and a general sense that the reasons for wanting to live in the countryside in the first place are gradually and irrevocably fading away. </p> <p>A funny thing happens when people talk about this, though. You listen to all the specifics, nodding politely, and - if you live in an urban environment - with part of your head thinking that this doesn't sound too bad, really. Then about half the time the person you are talking to will use the word \"community\". They will say, \"the community is going\", or there is \"less sense of community\", or they \"miss the feeling of community\". </p> <p>This is the point at which people lose me. I know that community is supposed to be a good thing and that we are all supposed to live in one. It's just that it seems to me to be a fact of modern countryside life that community, in this hearth-hallowed, warm-glow sense, doesn't exist. Far more than the town, the countryside is an atomised, fragmented place. I don't know whether the underlying factors in this are economic (the principal one being perhaps that countrysiders go somewhere else to earn their living, then return to their little boxes to live privately) or psychological (in that people who move to the country are doing so at some level to get away from other people). But I have lived in quite a few places in quite a few different countries, and I have never lived anywhere as essentially unfriendly, broken-up, atomised and fragmented as the English countryside. </p> <p>That was, in the end, the reason we left. Our house had a few acres of marsh land - unusable but beautiful - attached. One day I took my father out in my canoe and we saw that a stretch of trees, mainly beautiful low-hanging willows, had been cut down. It had obviously happened very recently. We investigated and found out that, with nods and winks, a group of locals had agreed to cut down our trees, in order to allow access for sailing boats down a side-creek. Nobody asked my father, and the feeling that the same people who would smile and nod and make small-talk about the weather would do this behind his back caused him to feel he couldn't live in that place any more. He realised that after 11 years, he was still an outsider; that the locals still did not trust him. He felt a deep, bitter, sense of personal betrayal. It gave him an intense feeling of insecurity. By my next holiday from university, three months later, he had sold the house and moved into Norwich. Three months after that he died of a heart attack. The business with the trees did not cause that, but it certainly did not help. </p> <p>It seems to me that people in the English countryside are trapped between the immovable conservatism of our patterns of land use, and the irresistible changes brought by population pressure. You can, on reflection, see why they are prone to complaint. But when they mourn the loss of a sense of community, they are asking us to mourn something which died a long time ago if, indeed, it ever existed. </p> <p>And there is another factor to consider when listening to the countryside blues. Although the countryside I visited had changed, the place which had looked like it had changed the most, and most for the worst, was Norwich. \"This used to be a charming city,\" Miller told me. \"You see that slogan on the sign as you're driving in: Norwich, a Fine City\". It makes you laugh because it's so Alan Partridge but the thing is it used to be true. For one thing Norwich is just the right size. It was always coming top in quality-of-life rankings for the best place to live in the UK. Now, though, it's all changed. The shoe factory closed, the chocolate factory closed. There are these hideous developments everywhere. And then the main thing is these pissed-up groups coming into the city in the evenings. It turns the city centre into a no-go area.\" </p> <p>All this, of course, is another story, and not strictly relevant to what has happened in the countryside. But it is worth bearing this in mind, the next time you hear a countrydweller having a bleat. \"Life in the countryside might have got worse,\" Miller told me, \"but life in the centre of Britain's cities has got worse quicker. That's why we choose to live in the country. We're not thick.\"</p>",

  "<p>Daffodils, cod, Christmas trees and the Highlands' ski resorts could have become victims of global warming by 2050 according to an energy-efficiency report today. Warmer weather will, instead, introduce vineyards to Scotland, stingrays and more types of sharks in our coastal waters as well as termites, scorpions and mosquitoes carrying West Nile virus and dengue fever, the study - Forecasting the Future - says. </p> <p>Published by the Energy Saving Trust, the body established by the government following the 1992 Rio Earth Summit, the document details the likely effect of climate change on Britain if nothing is done to cut emissions of greenhouse gases or reduce energy use. </p> <p>As much as \u00a3200bn-worth of property and infrastructure including 2m homes could be at risk from flooding and coastal erosion by the middle of the century, the projection suggests. The cost of buildings subsidence, exacerbated by weather extremes, could top \u00a3600m a year and storm damage could add another \u00a3800m to annual insurance claims. </p> <p>\"Flooding is a potential problem as winter rains grow heavier and sea levels rise,\" says the report, produced in conjunction with the UK Climate Impact Programme. \"Investment will be needed to protect London and other key places from flooding as well as vulnerable installations such as nuclear power stations. </p> <p>\"Within 50 years parts of East Anglia will have to be heavily defended against rising seas. Some land could be returned to the sea in more managed retreats.\" One such controlled breach of flood defences was carried out on Humberside last year. </p> <p>Average temperatures are expected to be between 1C and 4.5C higher by the end of the century, when golf courses will become increasingly expensive to maintain due to long hot summers. </p> <p>The report is being released as part of Energy Efficiency Week and comes amid a flurry of climate change predictions and warnings that not enough is being done to save energy or provide alternative sources from non-fossil fuel. Under the Kyoto protocol and other EU agreements, the UK must, by 2010, reduce its emissions of six major greenhouse gases by 12.5% compared with levels in 1990. The government has promised to reduce carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions by 20% by the end of this decade and by 60% by 2050. </p> <p>The trust's projections are based on the presumption that such demanding targets cannot be met. Little can be done to halt global warming over the next 30-40 years because of the vast amount of such gases already released by burning fossil fuels, the trust believes. But there is a chance to mitigate the worst impacts of global warming beyond that date. </p> <p>Last week the WWF (formerly the World Wide Fund for Nature) criticised the government for underestimating by 30% the true level of carbon dioxide emissions for which Britain is responsible. </p> <p>\"The prime minister's strong words on climate change in the UK are still being undermined by failure to control CO<sub>2 </sub>emissions,\" said the organisation's director of campaigns, Andrew Lee. </p> <p>\"Emissions at home are rising under Labour. In addition the economy is driving up emissions around the world.\" Food, manufactured goods and raw materials imported from abroad generate large CO<sub>2</sub> emissions abroad, the WWF says, for which UK consumers are responsible. </p> <p>This week Barbara Young, chief executive of the Environment Agency, will reinforce the message that individual consumers must make important choices. Consumption and energy use are rocketing, she will tell a conference in Birmingham. The number of electrical devices used by households in England and Wales is, for example, due to double this decade. The agency's estimate of the damage likely to be caused by flooding in 2080, if no action is taken to control global warming, is \u00a326bn a year. Emissions of greenhouse gases will need to be cut by 75% in 2050 to prevent such dangers, she suggests. More than a quarter of all carbon emissions come from cars and 28% from homes, according to the Energy Saving Trust. \"It is imperative that we become more aware of the energy we use in our homes and reduce our carbon dioxide emissions,\" warns Philip Sellwood, the trust's chief executive. </p> <p>\"Every time a light is switched on or a video is left on standby, carbon dioxide is emitted from a power station, causing damage to the environment. </p> <p>The worst scenario for 2050 in the trust's report are based on studies of the likely impact on the UK's environment. Lack of snow could render Scotland's ski resorts redundant in 20 years. Daffodils, bluebells and crocuses might disappear because of warmer winters, as would spruce trees. Cod would fail to flourish in warmer waters and could be replaced by tuna. </p> <p>Termites are already spreading north on the continent and are in France. Mosquitoes carrying fatal diseases could become a regular feature of the countryside. West Nile fever has already become endemic in the United States due to rising temperatures. Poisonous spiders could also flourish without winter frosts. </p> <p> <strong> On the way in</strong></p> <p> <strong> Creepy crawlies</strong> <br>Ticks, scorpions and poisonous spiders could become common in the hotter UK.</p> <p><strong> Hay fever</strong><br> Hay fever could be experienced for months on end as trees and grasses flower far beyond their previous seasons.</p> <p><strong> Pest control</strong><br> We will need to take action to control fleas, wasps, mice and rats, which thrive mild winters and hot summers.</p> <p><strong> Sharks</strong> <br> More types of sharks and stingrays could visit our warmer waters.</p> <p><strong> Termites</strong><br> These pests are spreading north through Europe and could reach the UK.</p> <p><strong> Diseases</strong><br> Mosquitoes carrying diseases such as Dengue fever and West Nile virus have already invaded the US and could become a regular feature here.</p> <p><strong> On the way out</strong></p> <p> <strong> Cod</strong><br> Warm waters further threaten dwindling numbers, with cod-and-chips potentially relegated to a thing of the past. </p> <p><strong> Scotland's ski resorts</strong><br> With milder temperatures and less snow, Scotland's ski industry has already had to diversify into other activities such as mountain biking and paragliding. </p> <p><strong> Golf courses</strong><br> These could become very expensive to maintain in the long, hot summers, with drought and water restrictions affecting the quality of grass, and waterlogged conditions in winter. </p> <p><strong> The village green</strong><br> Traditional greens could become difficult to maintain, as soaring temperatures and drought turn them brown.</p> <p><strong> Dormouse</strong><br> It could disappear as warmer summers and milder winters threaten its habitat.</p> <p><strong> Sunbathing</strong><br> Holidaymakers are likely to become more cautious of the summer sun.</p> <p><strong> Daffodils</strong><br> Warmer winters will threaten daffs and crocuses.</p>",
  "Parliament is to be protected from potential terrorist attack by boat or barge through the creation of a floating boom in the River Thames. <p>The change is the most likely security improvement to emerge from a cluster of new proposals put to the parliamentary authorities in a new 250-page report from M15 and the Metropolitan police. </p> <p>The boom would stretch up to one-third of the way across the fast-moving Thames preventing tourist boats passing close by the Terrace where MPs and peers sit in summer. </p> <p>But other more drastic proposals are almost certain to be rejected as excessive by MPs and peers anxious to avoid overreaction to the latest surge of domestic protests, notably by militant fathers and pro-hunters, on top of the wider global threat from Islamic terrorist groups. </p> <p>That is likely to mean there will be no road closures around Parliament Square, but that other plans, including better but unobtrusive security fences, more CCTV cameras and stricter wearing of ID passes will be adopted. </p> <p>Though tighter procedures have been introduced in recent years, the only firm decision taken this autumn has been to create a security supremo who will protect both Lords and Commons under a single chain of command. </p> <p>Given the historic separation of both houses that is controversial. </p> <p>MPs in on such discussions are wary of publicising the options for fear of encouraging attacks. But Big Ben, which is vulnerable from Westminster bridge, is a priority, as is full screening of the public gallery where a temporary glass barrier has been installed. </p> <p>Restrictions on access have included the press gallery where no media personnel or guests without security clearance are now permitted. </p> <p>Politicians also want to entice voters to inspect their working lives. \"The key is perimeter security so people who should be here should be able to relax,\" an MP said.</p>",
  "Recently, I got a call from a friend who'd been talking to a friend who had told her that there was going to be a bomb attack in central London on a particular day and had urged her to warn friends and family to stay well clear. There were similar rumours from other friends. How many people altered their plans for that day accordingly? How many others felt a sharp stab of anxiety as they stepped on to the underground escalator on their way to work? How many more have just got so used now to living with fear that it is a low-level constant in their anxious, stressed lives? <p>Fear has become the dominant currency of public life - our politics and our streets - and it reaches deep into our most private emotions. The biggest fears are, of course, those generated by the war on terror - with its motley cast of (mostly fictional) demons from ricin manufacturers to mad mullahs. But there are legions of other fearful phenomena crowding the airwaves and newspaper columns, from obesity to dodgy chicken legs. Some may have a basis in fact, but it is their inflation and our inability to grasp the nature of their risk that is the issue. Despite the unprecedented security of life in the west - we live for longer and are less vulnerable to absolute poverty than any previous generation of human beings - we seem more anxious, and fearful than ever. Why? </p> <p>This is the big question to which Adam Curtis is boldly offering an answer in his hugely important BBC series, The Power of Nightmares. Politicians once offered dreams of a better future; now they offer to protect us from nightmares. Fear becomes the political resource to be mined to boost politicians' own legitimacy and authority, argues Curtis as he traces the parallel development of the neo-cons in the US and Islamist terrorism. </p> <p>His analysis is unfolding before our eyes in the US elections. Power goes to those with the darkest nightmares, he argues. Kerry might be the more effective and competent debater, but that's not the point. Bush echoes the fear he has helped create. Fear is an emotion best assuaged by being shared. As one banner read at a recent Bush rally: \"You make me feel safe.\" </p> <p>The issue Curtis has set to explain is, as one of the most perceptive commentators featured in the series, Bill Durodi\u00e9, director of the International Centre for Security Analysis at King's College, puts it, \"why the juggernaut of the west is so preoccupied by the flea of al-Qaida\". Durodi\u00e9 points out that the number of terrorist incidents has gone down, not up, in the past decade and the vast majority of them are in places such as Kashmir. We face a tiny threat in comparison with what our grandparents faced in the late 30s - estimates of casualties from aerial bombardment in 1937 were put at 600,000 - with a fraction of their stoicism. </p> <p>Curtis's conclusion is basically that the neo-cons needed an enemy against which to define and justify an aggressive American imperialism. The nightmares provide an elite with the means to manipulate and manage the masses. His series has attracted controversy for its claim that al-Qaida doesn't exist (in any of the ways widely imagined, such as a global network of terrorists directed by someone from a hi-tech cave in the Hindu Kush) but what also requires attention is far closer interrogation of two questions he doesn't have room to explore. </p> <p>First, why are millions of perfectly sensible people so susceptible to the nightmares, and so bad at stripping back the fantasy to measure the true scale of risk? Durodi\u00e9 argues in a recent paper that while fear has often been used as a political tool in history, we are particularly vulnerable to it now because of how isolated and fragmented our lives are. He points to the second world war when the only incidence of panic was when people were isolated. </p> <p>Without the moorings of social connectedness to political, religious institutions and neighbourhoods, we have no reality check on our own fears. For example, without gossiping to the neighbour how do we build up that mutual assessment of risk to the wellbeing of our children? Furthermore, he suggests that our profound sense of insecurity is not fuelled by the perception that the world is changing very fast (to which Blair often refers) but rather by the fact that our collective ability to shape that change is so cripplingly weak (not an issue on which Blair wants to dwell). </p> <p>Closely related to this argument, the sociologist Zygmunt Bauman argues, in an essay to be published soon, that politicians have abdicated any responsibility for moderating the impact of the inherent insecurity and instability of market capitalism so they offer to assuage other types of insecurity, in particular our physical safety. Take his argument further, and it seems that as we are left to negotiate our own unpredictable and anxious course through the winner-takes-all society, we search for other focuses for our fear as a relief or justification for our performance or failure. We want nightmares to distract us. </p> <p>Second, what happens to a society that becomes so fearful? It offers politicians power, and it also promises goodies to security consultants, helpful academics and defence and police forces. It gobbles up taxpayers' money, and insurance premiums with precious little accountability. The peddling of fear is a lucrative business: security is the biggest global growth industry. Fear shifts newspapers and glues viewers to their TV screens. The media become profoundly complicit in promoting the interests of those who use fear, from terrorist to security analyst. </p> <p>We need to be much more aware of the corrosive impact of fear on politics and civil society. The ugliest and most powerful of political emotions, it short-circuits and distorts political debate. Once unleashed, it is very hard to reverse. Figures last week showed that while crime has fallen, fear of crime remains stubbornly high. Fear has its short-term uses for both politicians and the media but it delivers diminishing returns. One way to manage fear is to simply switch off: don't bother voting or watching the news, try Wife Swap instead. Worst of all, fear gets displaced. It may start as an insecurity over a job, a worry over a pension, but it can end up as racism. Fear needs clearly identifiable enemies. As the global flow of people speeds up, and our cities and countries become more diverse, there is no shortage of material out of which to fantasise the enemies of our nightmares. </p> <p>So when you feel afraid, question who or what has made you so - and why it was in their interests to do so - assess the risk, and always remember how much destruction fear ultimately wreaks on everything we call civilisation. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> The second part of The Power of Nightmares is on BBC2 on Wednesday </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:m.bunting@theguardian.com\">m.bunting@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Remember BSE, salmonella, E coli, alar on apples? From the mid-1980s right into the 1990s, food safety was rarely out of headlines, causing headaches for the Tories and unsettling the food industry. So when New Labour came into office in 1997, it was determined to sort out the troublesome issue of food once and for all. </p> <p>But the new government mistook food safety for public health. And it listened to siren food-industry voices that collectively said: \"Just deal with safety; ignore the troublesome issue of nutrition; leave that to individual choice; beware the nanny state.\" This was a serious mistake. </p> <p>Although food safety is important, its burden on the NHS and business is about \u00a3500m a year. In contrast, obesity alone costs us \u00a36bn-\u00a37bn a year, and coronary heart disease more than \u00a311bn. </p> <p>It took two reports into the future of healthcare, in 2002 and 2004, to shock the government into listening to evidence that has been around for decades: diet-related ill-health is a huge burden on the public purse - and it is preventable. The situation has now got so critical that many children are so overweight that they're likely to die at a younger age than their parents. </p> <p>This cannot go on, and everyone knows it. The public health white paper, first promised for May, then July, then October, may now appear next month. It has been delayed because a furious debate is going on within and outside Whitehall about what should be in it, with deep ideological divisions. </p> <p>Food companies that once cuddled up to New Labour are deeply unhappy about talk of advertising controls, fat taxes and pressure to reduce portion sizes or introduce traffic-light labelling. Last month the Food and Drink Federation launched a food and health manifesto, calling for \"partnerships\" - anything to deflect regulation. The Grocer, the supermarkets' house magazine, has a Junk the Spin campaign, urging readers to declare war on unfounded attacks in the name of public health. </p> <p>That these interest groups have had to come out into the open shows how worried they are - and how powerful is the evidence for change. They are more used to the cosy chat, the briefing, the \"leave it to us\". But with one-third of MPs supporting tougher controls on advertising targeted at children and the Food Standards Agency launching a \u00a34m anti-salt campaign, things have got serious. </p> <p>Tension within the holy triangle of food policy - the state, consumers/civil society and the supply chain - has erupted. The state, which has previously hidden behind market rhetoric of \"informed consumers\", is now fighting over what to do. Cosmetic change, always an option, will fail the policy laugh test. As the health committee's report on obesity highlighted this May, only joined-up government can deliver solutions to the public health crisis. </p> <p>Transport policy remains car-fixated, when cycling and walking would help build exercise into daily life. Sports policy seeks new Beckhams, yet playing fields for the masses are still being sold off. Agricultural policy churns out fat, when nutritional advice is to eat more fruit and vegetables. Meanwhile, town planning has been powerless before the rise of the new retail baronial class. Advertising warps food culture still further, with more than \u00a3500m a year enticing us to consume this or that sugary, fatty, salty brand. Central government, by contrast, spends \u00a313m on free fruit for four- to six-year-olds - welcome, but hardly tough health policy. </p> <p>At the heart of the political difficulty over food and health is the collapse of the old policy framework. After the second world war, Labour enshrined a new \"productionism\" in its 1947 Agriculture Act. The policy sought to increase output, through intensification of farming. This made sense then. Studies showed rampant nutritional deficiencies, here and globally. Farming under-produced. People paid too much for food. Dietary inequalities ruptured health. All these health failings could be addressed by increasing output and distribution. </p> <p>But times change. Today, the evidence shows the need for another food revolution. Humanity faces complex problems of over-, under- and mal-production and consumption. Intensive farming brought new hazards to workers, polluted waterways and damaged soil structure. </p> <p>If the old productionist policy was a response to problems of poor supply, today we need more subtle solutions. Health has been marginalised in food policy for too long. Cosmetic changes will not bring peace in the food wars that rage between the proponents of two alternative models of where the food supply chain should go. </p> <p>The first is a life sciences approach offering ever more hi-tech fixes with health at best as a bolt-on. Biotechnology gets the publicity but the big money is on nutrigenomics. Obesity in your genes? Suppress the \"fat gene\" with this lo-calorie delivering product range. Prostate cancer? Eat this selenium-enriched high-lycoprene special pizza. But we need population-wide change, not just exemplary improvement by the few. Nutrigenomics, like functional foods, appeals to the worried well. It is good for profits but health-irrelevant. </p> <p>That's why the second, ecological public-health approach is emerging as a serious contender. It sees health as central to society and supply chain alike, and requires the state to join up hitherto compartmentalised policy boxes. The challenge is not just what we grow or eat, but how we transport it. The food supply chain has been rewarded for making food cheaper, but who pays for the pollution caused by long-distance trucks, or jetting in all-year-round fresh fruit from the developing world? </p> <p>Nutritionists agree we should eat two portions of oily fish a week, but sea stocks are so dire there are good grounds to stop eating wild fish. The solution is likely to be in plant-based sources of those omega 3 and 6 fatty acids. And we are advised to eat five portions of fruit and veg a day. If we followed such advice, we'd merely suck in imports, as farmers are simply not growing what is good for health. </p> <p>This, then, is the challenge faced by the government. Does it espouse food as medicine, pursue ever cheaper food, and thereby externalise problems on to health and the environment? Or will it deliver a new public-health policy, making environmental and societal goals central to food and farming? </p> <p>Both paradigms - one integrating the life sciences, the other ecological and human health - are plausible; both carry political risks. If the public health white paper is to pass the laugh test, it must show the government realises the need to change how we live and how the food supply chain works. There are no quick fixes. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Tim Lang is professor of food policy at City University.

  "<p>It's probably not the ideal way to arrive in a snowy country - wearing nothing but your knickers and an anorak - but that was how my four-year-old daughter came to Oslo. </p> <p>Thinking we were past the projectile vomiting stage of babes in arms, I had made the mistake of not packing a spare outfit in my hand luggage. Hanna was sick in the cab on the way to the airport, and again on the plane. And we still had a four-and-a-half-hour bus ride ahead of us. </p> <p>You might be wondering why the resort of Geilo is recommended for people travelling with small children. Isn't the ease and comfort of getting to a place with kids part of the package? </p> <p>Well, if you were sensible, you'd do what most Brits do and take the weekly charter from Gatwick to Fagernes - a 90-minute transfer from Geilo. Sadly, as we had time only for a long weekend, we went on the daily scheduled flight via Oslo. </p> <p>Looking out of the bus window, I realised no airport transfer to a ski resort I had experienced in France, Spain or the US could compare with this. We drove past miles of glimmering lakes with orange sunlight pouring across them. Patchy snow became thicker and storybook copperised red-board houses dotted the sparkling scenery. </p> <p>Fortunately, Geilo lives up to its family-friendly image: a big bonus is the length of the ski season - from November to April. The main ski runs - many easy and intermediate - all arrive back in one place so it's hard to get lost in the frost. Under-sevens go free on the slopes and there's a large, friendly nursery in a timber building at the bottom. </p> <p>Our pad, the Highland hotel, was a five-minute transfer from the slopes. It had a startling collection of axes and knives in the foyer (they have been made in this area for centuries) and, like everywhere in these parts, an obsession with trolls. It had a heated indoor pool, sauna and games room for when the kids were too tired to ski. Everything about the hotel was practical without pretension, including the evening meals, where the kids got their own small buffet heaving with mini-frankfurters, fresh fried fish, mashed potato and jugs of juice. </p> <p>You can't get away from the fact that taking kids skiing for the first time is hard work (all that squeezing into padded pants, fitting helmets, finding boots that fit etc) but here you're all clunked into boots, skis and poles in no time (English is spoken very well). And then you're through the turnstiles, wiggling backwards into a chair lift, your feet like rulers swinging below. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Hanna was having her first lesson with an English teacher: how to get up the nursery slope on a button lift. 'Bend your knees Hanna!' I shouted as she wobbled by, her crash helmet cutting out her hearing. </p> <p>In three days, Hanna did well. She could get up the slope on the button and come down doing a 'pizza'. But the downhill skiing is only part of the thrill. I asked Hanna several months later what she liked best about the trip. It was making a new friend, she replied, and the extra-curricular activities: dog-sledding, sleigh rides and skidooing, to name a few. For me, it was the haunting scenery with its romantic light and wide, deserted, silent expanses. </p> <p>In a clearing in the woods we came across some husky-dog owners: he in baggy leather trousers, sporting a Father Christmas beard and a baseball cap; she with hair in plaits, a suntanned face and icy blue eyes to match those of the huskies. </p> <p>'For breakfast we have a bowl of soup made from the leftovers from the night before ...' she was telling a group of wide-eyed children. </p> <p>'For dinner, a mixture of dried fish/chicken/tripe from a 20-kilo block ...' It was a while before I worked out that she was discussing not her diet, but that of the 17 howling dogs behind her. </p> <p>One of you stands at the back of the sledge controlling the brakes, while the other lies down on a reindeer-skin covered sledge, a pack of five hounds pounding in front, swishing through the woods. </p> <p>'I wonder why she's wiping her face?' mumbled a worried mother next to me as her daughter whizzed into view on a sledge pulled by huskies. She was referring to the dogs' habit of defecating while running. But there was no need to worry. </p> <p>The real bonus for me was the least expected part of the trip - a spot of cross-country skiing. A couple of minutes' trudge from the main slopes of Geilo is a five-kilometre track circling a huge frozen lake. We encountered only one other person. Pure peace. </p> <p>But how can a place like this be family friendly when Norway is so expensive? If you miss the transfer bus, a taxi will cost you \u00a310; a beer is \u00a35; a packet of cigarettes \u00a37. The answer is that most English families come here on one-week half-board packages (similar prices to the Alps but better quality) and pay a supplement to take a picnic from the breakfast buffet to the slopes for lunch. </p> <p>The food at the Highland was excellent and featured lots of reindeer and trout. Best fun is the Friday night seafood special with mountains of prawns, clams, crayfish and mussels, rollmops and salmon. Many Norwegians come at weekends (the buffet being the first stop) though I was bemused by the bloke in front of me who combed the prawns in search of all the non-male ones with fewer gungy bits. </p> <p>Even Norwegians can't afford to get drunk in the hotel bar, which, like the scenery, remained empty, even on a Friday. What are they all doing post-9pm? Are they having a clean family fun holiday - kids tucked up, reading a good book - or are they in front of the box guzzling a bottle of Absolut?</p> <p><strong>Why Scandinavia's cool for the whole family</strong></p> <p>The ski resorts of Sweden, Norway and Finland have made huge gains against the Alps in recent years to become one of the world's top ski regions for families. So what's the secret of their success? </p> <p><strong> The resorts</strong><br> </p> <p> 'Scandinavia has always been perceived as the dark, cold north, and very expensive, but it's not true: it's friendly and relaxed. It's always been a great place for families,' said a spokesman for Crystal Ski. </p> <p>Geilo in Norway is considered the best family ski resort. Sweden boasts the colossal resort of Are, with three skiing areas and an appetite for partying that beats most alpine resorts, plus the excellent Vemdalen. Finland has a small area of interesting skiing in Levi and Yllas, its main attraction an abundance of Santas and off-piste activities such as husky sledding and sleigh rides. </p> <p><strong> Safe Skiing</strong><br> </p> <p> 'Pistes tend to be fenced off and well marked, unlike in France where there's just a couple of easily missed posts. They are well patrolled, reckless skiers are pulled up for bad behaviour, and there's always someone to help if a child gets stuck,' said a Crystal spokesman. Older children can learn to ski off-piste in a safe environment as there is a low avalanche risk. </p> <p><strong> Snow conditions</strong><br> </p> <p> In the Alps you have to go high for the best snow, but because Scandinavia is so far north you can stay low and still find tons of powder, even at 800 metres, so the kids don't freeze or get altitude sickness. Around Christmas time, daylight hours are between 10am and 3pm, but most pistes are floodlit so can stay open till 10pm, unlike the Alps where they close by five. </p> <p><strong> Active alternatives</strong><br> </p> <p> For little ones who tire of skiing by lunchtime, there is plenty to do; husky rides, sleigh rides, ski-dooing, ice-skating, wolf farms, and kids can spot wild elk and reindeer. At Christmas time a visit to Santa can be a highlight for children. </p> <p><strong> Childcare</strong><br> </p> <p> Most Scandinavians speak flawless English, so kids find their instructors easy to understand. Many hotels have children's facilities such as playrooms and ball pools. </p> <p><strong> New this season</strong><br> </p> <p> Geilo has a new creche in the Vestlia Ski Centre for six-month- to four-year-olds, bookable through Thomson and Crystal.

  "He is the man appointed by Tony Blair to protect the public from poisonous chemicals. Yet the rural affairs minister, Alun Michael, has admitted that his body contains a cocktail of toxic substances, many of which have been banned on safety grounds for decades. <p>The minister agreed to have the results of his blood test published to make people aware of the issue of pollutants and chemicals contained in everyday items such as sofas, cosmetics, mattresses and televisions. </p> <p>Tests on the enthusiastic hill-walker and keen supporter of organic food detected 33 hazardous man-made compounds in his blood, including pesticides, flame retardants and industrial plastics. </p> <p>What is worrying campaigners is that more than 90 per cent of these have been banned, some as long ago as the 1970s, after being linked to cancer, immune-system disorders and neurological problems. </p> <p>The findings have been described as proof that no one is safe from the build-up of harmful chemicals in the environment, even if the actual contamination occurred decades ago. </p> <p>The precise health implications remain unknown because many of the chemicals have never been tested on humans. In addition, a method for calculating the cocktail effects of chemicals once they are in the bloodstream has yet to be devised. </p> <p>Michael admitted that his results served as evidence that everybody in Britain was being exposed to chemical contamination, but said the levels were extremely low and should not be a cause for immediate alarm. 'It does demonstrate the range of chemicals to which we are exposed,' he added. </p> <p>Sir Tom Blundell, the biochemist appointed by Tony Blair to chair the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, warned that Michael's results would fuel a growing consensus that the prevalence of untested chemicals in the environment could become a major public health issue. Blundell said he had repeatedly warned ministers that the issue could become the 'next tobacco'. </p> <p>'We are conducting a huge experiment on ourselves and I am not surprised that a large number of chemi cals have accumulated in the tissues of Mr Michael,' he said. </p> <p>One of the substances found in the minister's body belongs to a family of chemicals including perfluorooctane sulphonate, used in chrome plating and fire-fighting foam, which the minister banned only last Tuesday. </p> <p>Announcing his decision to start phasing out the chemical, which has linked to bladder cancer, Michael described it as a substance that 'presents a real and significant risk to the health of the population and the environment in the UK. I am concerned that a substance with these intrinsic properties is still used.' </p> <p>Sixty milligrams of blood were taken from Michael and analysed for 103 industrial substances linked to health concerns. He agreed to undertake the tests in order to raise the issue at a time when Britain is pushing for tighter regulation. </p> <p>Blundell believes the government must act quickly if it is to sidestep litigation. 'The health of millions could be affected by these chemicals and there could be some very serious outcomes. At the moment it remains very difficult to prove the relationship between cause and affect, but that could change,' he warned. </p> <p>Dr Vyvyan Howard, a toxicologist at Liverpool University and a member of the government's advisory committee on pesticides, said: 'Asbestos was known to be bad in about the 1900s, but it still took 60 or 70 years to stop its use. People are going to die in the next 20 years because of decisions already taken.' Although the levels of contaminants in the minister's blood were small, Howard said they could 'hijack the development' of a foetus. </p> <p>Elizabeth Salter-Green, chemical campaigner for environmental pressure group WWF, which organised the tests on the minister, said: 'If Alun Michael was a pregnant mother, it is not unreasonable to assume there could be effects on the foetus. The fact their health effects are completely unknown is ridiculous in the 21st century.' </p> <p>Other chemicals in the blood of the former marathon runner included polychlorinated biphenyls, which have been banned over concerns that they could cause infertility. </p> <p>'We know that in animals some of these substances increase the incidence of cancer,' Howard said.</p> <p>'Temporally and biologically, it is plausible these chemicals may play a role.' </p> <p>Chemical firms reject claims they are poisoning people and Department of Health officials who examined Michael's results told him there was 'no evidence that such trace amounts have adverse effects on health'. Such guidance has angered experts who claim that government officials had no evidence to substantiate these claims. </p> <p>Legislation on the chemicals industry is under consideration by the European Commission, a move that would place the onus on the industry to prove that the everyday use of 30,000 substances is safe. Britain has taken a lead on pushing through the proposals, according to Michael, and has pulled together both environmental groups and industry to agree on a new testing procedure for toxic substances. </p> <p>However, the plans will have to survive lobbying from US interests. A confidential memo seen by The Observer reveals how the US has campaigned aggressively against any crackdown on the industry, arguing it would affect the \u00a320 billion of chemicals that America exports to Europe each year.</p>",
  "<p>A series of graphic warnings about the dangers of climate change and the \u00a3200 billion damage that could be caused by global warming will be launched next week as part of a multi-million-pound government campaign to urge consumers to use less energy. </p> <p>A hard-hitting report will provide apocalyptic descriptions of sweltering summers and massive winter floods, disappearing village greens, daffodils and fish stocks, and infestations of scorpions and pests - all as soon as 2050. </p> <p>It will be followed by a government-backed advertising campaign in the press and on billboards. A bid has also been made to show them on television. The campaign will urge people to use less energy and so curb emissions blamed for global warming which causes climate change. </p> <p>The mass campaign - with a total budget of \u00a36m - will be seen as an admission by ministers that Britain needs to do more to avoid the dangers of climate change. </p> <p>The adverts will urge people to take action in their own lives - from turning down the thermostat to insulating their home to choosing a 'greener' car. The government's Energy Saving Trust (EST) estimates people waste \u00a35bn of energy a year. </p> <p>The report also details an 'Alternative Future' - where everybody drives an electric or fuel-cell car made of recyclable soya oil and lives in fully insulated homes. </p> <p>But environmental critics said the government was picking an easy target and ducking tougher policy decisions which would have much greater impact. </p> <p>'The government is committed to programmes that will increase the amount of carbon in the atmosphere, such as their road-building program and expanding the aviation industry,' said Penny Kemp, the Green Party environment spokeswoman. </p> <p>'We know energy efficiency is important but they are making easy choices. What they are not making are tough economic choices that have to be made if we're going to tackle climate change and tackle it urgently.' </p> <p>The climate change report will be published tomorrow by the government's EST.</p>",
  "<p>Its arched windows are smashed in, its elegant stone entrance boarded up and the only residents of its green-domed cupolas are pigeons. The derelict building called Tower House in east London has seen better days. It has also seen some famous residents. When it was a hostel before the Second World War it gave shelter to Josef Stalin, George Orwell and Jack London. </p> <p>The building's pivotal role in working-class history as a home to thousands of itinerant workers who came to London during the last century to make their living is about to be swept aside. The local council says it has no option but to sell the building to a private developer who will turn it into 100 luxury flats. Naturally, there will be basement parking to ensure that the occupants don't have to venture on to the street outside. </p> <p>Jack London, the author of Call of the Wild and White Fang was first in the line of anarchists, authors and lost souls to shelter here. He christened it The Great Monster Doss House in his seminal work of living among the East End poor, People of the Abyss, in 1902. He described it as packed with 'life that was degrading and unwholesome'. </p> <p>Five years later, Stalin, then Joseph Djugashvili, spent a fortnight there in a sixpence-a-night cubicle when he attended the Fifth Congress of the Russian Social Democratic and Labour Party across the road in Whitechapel. Lenin, meanwhile, preferred to commute from Bloomsbury where he could also visit the British Museum. The congress, to which British intelligence turned a blind eye, consolidated the supremacy of the Bolshevik party and debated strategy for communist revolution in Russia. Stalin never wrote or spoke about his stay in London and most Russian witnesses to it were wiped out in his Great Terror. </p> <p>Tower House was immortalised in 1933, when George Orwell, in Down and Out in Paris and London, praised it as the 'best of all common lodging houses with excellent bathrooms'. He didn't like the strict rules banning cards, cooking and no entry before 7pm. But he was only paying a shilling a night rent and it seemed fairly good value. </p> <p>Down and Out in Paris and London established Orwell's reputation with its groundbreaking reportage about poverty on both sides of the Channel. The author put on tramp's clothing to enter a desperate world of destitution and 'spikes', the casual wards in which men could stay once a month before having to move on. Orwell sold his clothes in Lambeth 'where the people are poor and there are a lot of rag shops'. He compared the joie de vivre of 1930s Paris with the dull streets of prewar London 'sleeping the deep sleep of England'. And he noted: 'It is fatal to look hungry. It makes people want to kick you.' </p> <p>His manuscript, provisionally entitled Confessions of a Dishwasher, was rejected by several publishers including TS Eliot, who felt it lacked narrative unity. When it finally appeared its authorship was credited to George Orwell - his real name was Eric Blair - so that it would not offend his family. Orwell later admitted some of his adventures in the underbelly of society were fictitious. But the book had enormous social significance in class-ridden Britain, a theme to which Orwell returned in The Road to Wigan Pier. </p> <p>By contrast Tower House was claimed to be a house 'fit for an archbishop' by Lord Rowton, the philanthropist who built it more than a century ago to provide cheap and clean accommodation for thousands of working men who flocked to London and were forced to live in disease-ridden lodging houses. For the past 20 years it has lain empty and derelict. The police consider the building a major danger. It is used by street drinkers and heroin addicts and has been the scene of gang rapes and horrific violence. </p> <p>The East End as described by Jack London and Orwell is rapidly disappearing, giving way to communities that are more divided than ever. Even Spitalfields' centuries-old fruit and veg market is to be redeveloped after a 14-year legal fight by local residents to save it. </p> <p>Tower House is the latest victim, and has been the subject of disputes for years. It lies in one of the poorest areas of the country, with the highest infant mortality rates. Tower Hamlets council currently has 32,800 people living in dirty, overcrowded accommodation, with 13,000 of them waiting to be transferred to better homes. </p> <p>Yet the drive to build more luxury flats to service the richest parts of the capital continues, despite the huge need for affordable homes and the recent downturn in the property market. Soup kitchens, factories and lofts are being snapped up by City workers eager for that edgy urban feel and tired of commuting. Tower House is perfect as it is only ten minutes' walk from the City. </p> <p>But the new owner of the 104-year-old building John Christodoulou said he was doing his bit for the homeless. </p> <p>'The council is getting a total of \u00a35.75m in terms of cash and properties for the homeless. It's a good deal. You should have seen the state of the place - the police can't thank us enough - it was full of needles, condoms, you name it. </p> <p>'I want to rent to City people and semi-professionals - they have to live somewhere if we want to keep the City an important financial area.' </p> <p>New figures released tomorrow by the homeless charity St Mungo's estimate that more than 800 homes are needed to clear the bottleneck in London's hostels alone. Its regional director, David Devoy, pointed out the charity has used empty buildings such as Tower House to offer thousands of people a safe place to sleep: 'Luxury flats do not offer a solution to the people we exist to help,' he said. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Romanian builders were yesterday stripping Tower House of the accumulated tons of detritus of 30 years of dereliction. They give an ironic laugh when asked if they knew who stayed there. 'Ha ha, Stalin. But soon it will be nice.'</p>",
  "The American prison company whose director set up Iraq's infamous Abu Ghraib jail for use by the US military is bidding to run a number of prisons in Britain. <p>The Utah-based Management and Training Corporation (MTC) has set up a London headquarters and is in advanced negotiations to operate at least one prison in Britain. It is also planning bids to build and manage a number of other jails, including the extension of Belmarsh in south-east London, Britain's maximum security prison, where terrorist suspects are being held without trial. </p> <p>The disclosure has provoked anger among MPs and prison groups. Brian Caton, general secretary of the Prison Officers' Association, said: 'Serious questions have to be asked about a British prison being run by a company whose director was in charge of setting up a system that led to the atrocities and torture of Iraqi detainees by prison personnel.' </p> <p>After Saddam Hussein's regime was toppled, John Ashcroft, the US attorney general, put MTC director Lane McCotter in charge of reopening Iraq's prison system. He helped to rebuild Abu Ghraib and trained Iraqi citizens to work in prisons. </p> <p>New York's senior senator, Democrat Charles Schumer, has been pushing for an investigation into any alleged role played by civilian contractors in the prisoner abuse scandal. McCotter left Iraq to resume his executive job at MTC in September 2003, a month before the worst documented atrocities against Iraqi prisoners occurred. In a statement, he insisted he had nothing to do with training military personnel to run the prison and had no involvement with Abu Ghraib after handing it over to the US armed forces. He said he was 'offended and sickened' by the abuse of Iraqi prisoners. </p> <p>Last week US Staff Sergeant Ivan Frederick was sen tenced to eight years in prison for sexually and physically abusing detainees at Abu Ghraib. </p> <p>There is no suggestion that McCotter was personally involved in the abuses at Abu Ghraib, but questions have been raised about whether the culture of the US private penal system influenced the environment that allowed the atrocities to occur. </p> <p>McCotter, a Vietnam veteran, has a chequered record of running US jails. In 1997 he was forced to resign as a senior prison official in Utah after a scandal surrounding the death of a mentally ill inmate strapped naked to a chair for 16 hours. This year, Schumer wrote to Ashcroft, asking why someone with McCotter's controversial history was sent to Iraq. </p> <p>Last year MTC was criticised by the US Justice Department over its management of Santa Fe prison in New Mexico which was found to have unsafe conditions and lack adequate medical care for inmates. The company said the problems have been resolved and it has had its contract renewed. </p> <p>Liberal Democrat Home Affairs spokesman Mark Oaten expressed concerns that Britain's prison culture could be undermined by the arrival of American firms. </p> <p>'The government is in cloud-cuckoo-land if it thinks privatising prisons will solve the mess. The problems of suicides, overcrowding and reoffending will not be solved by bringing in a private company from the US.' </p> <p>This view was echoed by Labour MP Gwyn Prosser, who sits on the home affairs select committee and said the Home Office should 'proceed with caution'. Last year the Prison Service announced a \u00a33 billion, 10-year refurbishment programme of Britain's prison network. Since 1992, 13 prisons or secure training centres in Britain have been built and managed by private contractors under the government's Private Finance Initiative. The POA has been vociferous in its campaign against prison privatisation. </p> <p>Carl Stuart, MTC's communications director, said MTC began its corporate life as a training company aimed at helping offenders and has a long track record in successful rehabilitation.</p>",
  "<p>While undergoing treatment for breast cancer, Carol Harrigan went to stay with her brother. When she was given the all-clear she breathed a sigh of relief and moved back home. But within a few weeks the cancer was back. Four months later she died. Her daughter Claire wanted to know why. Was it the house that had killed her? </p> <p>We have all heard about sick building syndrome, but how much do we think about what might be harming our health in the comfort of our own home? There could be a lot more than the ominous dust mite to fear. A report published last week by researchers at Bristol University showed a possible link between the use of aerosols and air fresheners in the home and stomach upsets and earache in young children. </p> <p>Our homes are full of dangerous chemicals, and not just the ones we use to 'clean' them. Asthma and eczema sufferers could be reacting to chemicals in their easy-care bedding. Some fire-retardant chemicals are highly toxic. Formaldehyde gas can be released by carpets, upholstery fabrics, ply and particle board, causing headaches, dizziness, rashes, nausea and irritation to the eyes, nose and throat. Then there are phthalates - chemicals used to make plastic flexible (think vinyl flooring and synthetic carpets). Children who crawl and play at floor level are exposed to the highest levels of these chemicals which can interfere with the reproductive system and have also been linked to liver damage and respiratory problems. </p> <p>'People should be able to trust that everything they buy for the home is free from hazardous chemicals,' says Dr David Santillo, senior scientist at the Greenpeace Research Laboratories at the University of Exeter. 'We are trying to make people more aware of chemicals in products, because they are not getting the information else where.' His team has analysed hundreds of products. Recent examination of samples of house dust revealed the presence of highly toxic fire-retardant chemicals. 'These are turning up in people's bodies. They could be coming from textiles and electronic equipment,' says Santillo. When you think about cot mat tresses it makes you shudder. It's no surprise that reported cases of Multiple Chemical Sensitivity (MCS) are on the rise. It's a condition that is hard to pin down as symptoms are many and varied, often mimicking those of colds or flu and including joint pains, genito-urinary problems and auto-immune disorders. </p> <p>Claire looked at all the potentially toxic things in her mother's home. She also considered the less scientifically demonstrable effects of electromagnetic fields - not just from pylons and phone masts but from power points and appliances in the home - that could damage the immune system. Then she remembered that a dowser had visited the home and announced that it was in an area of geopathic stress, the stress line apparently right below her mother's bed. Geopathic stress lines are said to be areas where 'negative' energy leaks out of the earth's core. In 1929 German scientist and dowser Gustav Freiherr von Pohl drew up a map of areas of geopathic stress in the town of Vilsbiburg. He subsequently found that all the 54 patients who had died of cancer there since records had been kept had slept in beds in areas marked on his map. But there has been little scientific research since. </p> <p>Claire also looked at the things that affect our sense of well-being - light, colour and smell. She left her job in the City to work as a builder and alternative practitioner. She does her own brand of feng shui on people's homes, using colour and aromatherapy as well as practical things like de-cluttering. Occasionally she gets out her dowsing rods. She has been particularly successful at giving homes that positive feeling that makes them sell. And she's rebuilding the inside of her own home as a 'ritual retreat'. </p> <p><strong>Here's how to clear the air</strong><br></p> <p>Banish hazardous chemicals<br> Before you buy anything new for your home, check out Greenpeace's Chemical House (<a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/toxics\">www.greenpeace.org.uk/toxics</a>) that lists products containing potentially dangerous levels of toxic chemicals.</p> <p>Safe cleaning<br> Diluted vinegar, lemon and salt are as effective as many chemically based cleaning products.

  "<p>Over the next 10 days, Wall Street and global financial markets have two significant dates to look forward to: the 75th anniversary of the 1929 stock market crash on 29 October, and the presidential elections on 2 November. </p> <p>The first date speaks for itself. The second finds the US financial community - like the rest of the United States - in a state of conflict. Like the direction of the US economy itself, the financial effects of a win by either candidate are almost impossible to read. </p> <p>Typically, Wall Street is solidly Republican, and appears so this time. Economists give Bush an edge on growth and jobs and Kerry on issues of trade and budget deficits. Pensions &amp; Investments, a trade magazine for money managers, found 58.6 per cent of 1,700 readers backed Bush, compared with 33.6 per cent for Kerry. </p> <p>Neither Bush nor Kerry has stressed their economic plans, perhaps knowing that in all likelihood they will be powerless to effect them. </p> <p>'In general, Wall Street would prefer Bush,' says Gregory R Valliere, chief strategist at Charles Schwab. 'They prefer him on tax policy and as a free-trader, as well as for the likelihood that Kerry would be a far more aggressive regulator.' </p> <p>An LA Times survey found that the financial services industry has opened its chequebook for Bush. Of the President's top 10 corporate contributors (ranked by number and size of employee donations) Morgan Stanley led with $527,030, with Merrill Lynch second at $495,604. </p> <p>The figures speak as a reward to Bush for his tax reforms, especially in reducing the tax on dividend income. Further, since Kerry emerged with the potential to win the election the markets have steadily dropped. </p> <p>But while Bush's economic policies have benefited Wall Street, there is the persistent fear that the broader consequences - spectacular federal budget deficits and soaring personal debt - will take the economy and securities markets over a cliff. </p> <p>The 'disaster now or catastrophe later' school of economic thinking, led by Steven Roach, Morgan Stanley's global chief economist, holds that neither Bush nor Kerry can do much to correct the US's economic course. Under the bleakest scenario, foreign banks will stop buying US securities, the dollar will plunge, the Fed will raise interest rates, consumers will stop spending, house prices will fall and the country will be plunged into recession. </p> <p>That view is as disputable as most of what passes for discourse in this election. Last week Bush campaign managers attacked Kerry's domestic economic plan with a letter signed by 368 economists. The group, Economists for Bush, said Kerry's proposed tax increases threatened the economy's vitality. His plan to 'expand the size and scope of government will limit future economic growth and lead to increasingly grim fiscal choices,' they wrote. </p> <p>The Kerry campaign countered with a letter signed by 169 business school professors, 56 from the Harvard Business School. </p> <p>It read: 'We are concerned that US economic policy has taken a dangerous turn under your stewardship ... your policy of slashing taxes - primarily for those at the upper reaches of the income distribution - has not worked.' </p> <p>Wall Street Democrats accuse their counterparts of placing personal gain ahead of responsibility to clients. 'The average Wall Street firm is run by extraordinarily avaricious, greedy people who don't know their own interests,' said Seth Glickenhaus, 91-year-old founder of the money management firm Glickenhaus &amp; Co. </p> <p>'These are salespeople,' he told the LA Times. 'They're not thinkers.' </p> <p>Kerry has a significant lead on issues of fiscal responsibil ity in the polls. Studies by Brian Knight of Brown University show that the economy tends to do better overall under the Democrats, while benefiting specific industries, such as defence and pharmaceuticals, under the Republicans. </p> <p>But as with so much else in this election, tradition is inverted. Republican administrations would typically be anti-deficit spending, but under Bush the national debt ballooned to $477 billion as money has poured into farm subsidies, social security, healthcare and the military. </p> <p>The argument in some quarters is that in order to be fiscally prudent, it is now better to vote Democrat. With such manifest inconsistencies, and the problems the US faces as babyboomers retire, it's little wonder Bush and Kerry would rather not talk too much about it. </p> <p>In 1992, James Carville coined the political maxim 'It's the economy, stupid!' This year's version, the joke goes, is: 'It's the economy, dammit!' </p> <p>Perhaps more important than who is in the White House is the political balance of Congress. Wall Street likes legislative gridlock because politicians cannot apply their financial ideas. </p> <p>'It's an acceptable scenario to the market because when they have gridlock they do less harm,' says Valliere. While there can be no comprehensive energy policy or tort reform, the new president can still appoint to the regulatory agencies. Both candidates plan to halve the annual budget deficit by 2009; most economists doubt either will be able to. </p> <p>While Bush and Kerry would like to appear in control of the economic future, they are servants of the economic cycle and second to the Federal Reserve. </p> <p>'The candidates might have some impact on jobs in the margins but Greenspan is more important than the President and the economic cycle is more important than Greenspan,' says Valliere. </p> <p>And where are we in the cycle? 'It's an erratic recovery that will prevail.'</p>",
  "<p>Iggy Pop lives in Miami these days, which seems all wrong, until his PA picks you up from chic South Beach and drives you over the bridge, away from the roller-bladers, the hip-hoppers, the glittering sea - to ramshackle Little Haiti, and Iggy's place. </p> <p>We pull up at the end of a cul-de-sac outside a modest bungalow. Modest, except for the soft-top Rolls Royce Corniche nestled under the car port. Iggy is out back, at the bottom of his small garden, sitting by the river in shorts, shirt and flip-flop, singular. </p> <p>He looks amazing, as he always has done. Whippet body burnt to leathery teak, hair blonde and straggly, face like a cartoon: boggle eyes, sunken cheeks, turned up nose, shark grin. A red Indian sun bunny, or, yes, an iguana (in a wig). 'Well, hey!' says Iggy, enthusiastically. 'Come on and look at my river! Isn't it beautiful?' </p> <p>Actually, no: it's brown and sludgy, and on the bank opposite is a rotten old shack and an industrial plant. Still, Iggy seems to like it. He doesn't swim here (no one would), but he sits and looks and thinks, and he works in the house. Iggy, born James Osterberg on 21 April 1947, is now 57 and still not retired; he has brought out no fewer than seven LPs over the past 15 years, the last reuniting him with his original band, The Stooges, alongside more contemporary names such as Green Day and Peaches. This as well as acting in a clutch of films, including Cry Baby, Tank Girl, Dead Man and The Crow II. Plus Jim Jarmusch's Coffee and Cigarettes , released this week. </p> <p>First, though, Iggy takes me on a tour. His place is small but stuffed: Haitian love goddesses battle it out with Mexican madonnas on Italian marble tops and Chinese antique dressers, which cuddle up to cow-skinned chairs, curly mirrors, a cartoon of the serial killer Carl Panzram, a 'cut-up' work by a contemporary of William Burroughs, Brion Gysin. There's an Iggy painting of a Stooges gig on one wall; a Shirelles CD sits like a single on the old record player. The house is dark, except for the kitchen. It's hot and sticky outside; Iggy's place feels voodoo, swampy, Southern. </p> <p>Iggy himself, though, is sunniness personified. What a gent he is: friendly to the point of goofiness, always laughing. This is only shocking if you know his history. On stage: receiving blow-jobs, spiking heroin, brawling with Hell's Angels, rolling around on broken glass, giving his (impressive) dick a regular airing, throwing himself into the crowd, crashing to the floor, losing himself and taking the audience with him like no other rock performer ever has. Offstage: similar. The unstoppable, original Jean Genie. Today, Iggy's booming voice and Come ahn! speech cadences make me think of a motivating corporate speaker. It's just that, instead of 'Believe in yourself! It's all in you!', he's saying: 'With the Stooges' first albums people said, \"A monkey could have written that! My five-year-old could have played that!\" And now they call 'em classic albums and I'm like, FUUUUCK! Fuuuck yooou!' Which is the same thing, really. </p> <p>Iggy's upbeat nature underpins his part in Coffee and Cigarettes. The film is made up of several short ones joined together, each based around two famous participants meeting up for a fag, a brew and a natter. The result is uneven, to say the least. Tough it out, though, for Cate Blanchett's section (she plays both parts), for Alfred Molina and Steve Coogan, the Wu Tang Clan's GZA and RZA plus waiter Bill Murray, and Iggy and Tom Waits. </p> <p>Their bit was filmed in 1992 - I saw it as a short with another Jim Jarmusch movie ages ago - but Iggy remembers it clearly. Jarmusch tagged the film on to the end of a Tom Waits pop video shoot; writing the script himself and giving it to Iggy and Tom the night before the filming. 'Neither of us were thrilled about the content,' grins Iggy. 'Tom walked in, threw the script on the table and said, 'Hey Jim, why don't you circle the laughs here because I don't see any.' And I was grumping over the whole thing about my name (Iggy offers Tom various options: Call me Jim, Iggy, Ig, Jim), you know, I'm in a scene with Tom Waits, who I look up to, and the stage direction is, Tom will be late, Tom will be surly ... ' </p> <p>The very funny scene plays on Tom's awkward git nature and Iggy's desire to please: 'I thought to myself, well Jim's seen something about me. He'd spent time with us both, had a look and went from there. It's just a more thorough version of what all directors do before they cast. They're like, well, she didn't look fuckable, or he looked like a smart guy, or a guy the average American will follow into battle ...' What Jarmusch saw is what you see when you meet Iggy: a sweet guy vulnerable to criticism. </p> <p>He has seen the film once. He likes the bits where 'I totally forgot to act'; it was the first time in his acting career that he'd dropped his armour and got it right. 'It takes time. It's hard for an old git to learn anything new and the only way you do it is the same way you did it when you were 18. Jump into something where you are painfully inept.' </p> <p>The painful ineptness of The Stooges was a major part of their appeal. They formed in Detroit in the late Sixties, when counter-culture wafted and wore beads; they played raw, heart attack sounds to panic the hippies. Iggy and The Stooges' amateurish industrial discord was genuinely ahead of its time, and it came with other talents: the look, the energy, the ideas, a whole charged being that emerged from their outrageous live performances, from what the journalist Lester Bangs called their 'illiterate chaos'. Ask Iggy, though, and he just says: 'We were interesting and we were cheap. That's pretty much how I've been getting my gigs ever since. Not much has changed - maybe the price is a little less cheap, maybe I'm a little less interesting, but still, that's the basic idea, ha-ha!' </p> <p>Neither The Stooges, nor Iggy solo ever had a proper hit single, except for 1986's 'Real Wild Child'. Still, 'I Wanna Be Your Dog ' (1969), 'The Passenger' (a B side, unbelievably) and 'Lust For Life' are proper pop classics. The latter two we owe to David Bowie, who in the mid-Seventies dragged a burnt-out Iggy from an LA psychiatric ward (Iggy scored coke off him whilst in there) and took him to Berlin. There Bowie produced and Iggy performed two era-defining albums in a single year (1977): Lust For Life and The Idiot . Iggy was by no means a Bowie creation, though: they fed from one another, with the cannier Bowie taking Iggy's outrageous style and parlaying it later into Ziggy Stardust. Perhaps in recompense, in 1982, Bowie covered Iggy's 'China Girl', which earnt Iggy hundreds of thousands. Then, in 1996, Trainspotting 's soundtrack introduced him to a new generation; but it is only recently, mostly through licensing his tracks to adverts, that Iggy has made any money at all. </p> <p>This is partly because he was never that interested. Too busy. Iggy's younger years were consumed by consumption - of drink, women, violence, crime, music, experience. And a huge amount of drugs, including those which we think of as modern: 'I had ecstasy when it was called MDA and MDMA. I was homeless, penniless, clothes-less, in poor health, knocking up some crazy woman, wandering round for three and four days ... extremely happy! I had crack when it was called rock cocaine, I had the forerunners of Xanax, I had pretty much anything.' But it was heroin which crocked Iggy - as it does: 'It flips on you pretty quickly.' Why so many drugs? 'Not to boost my confidence about making music: to shut out the negative voices. You don't have next week's rent. Thirty-seven people in important positions think you're no fucking good. You are going to be slammed in your next interview.' </p> <p>Even now, when his only vices are coffee and wine, Iggy says his work is fuelled by 'what Dali characterised as the paranoid critical method': he is always worrying, trying to push his talent to better things. At the moment he is obsessed with making another LP; he tells me he wants to complete the circle - record, release and tour a final Iggy and The Stooges album before he is 60, when he'll retire. That's why he is spending so much time in this house, even though he's actually got a more conventional South Beach pad, where his girlfriend lives with their three dogs, two cats and a bird. Over there is where he eats and sleeps, over here is where 'I wrestle with some matter of grave importance to the future of art, ha-ha, sitting quietly with bombs going off in my head'. </p> <p>In a city of show-stopping women, Iggy's girlfriend, Nina, could get a man arrested: a green-eyed, half-Nigerian, half-Irish amazon, who gave up air hostessing to take care of him. They have been together five years. Her looks really tickle Iggy: 'I'm the old git with the chick with the bam-BOW, the Roller convertible, the little old rock band ... the kinds of happiness that eluded me at 14 are mine now!' </p> <p>Iggy grew up an only child in a rural trailer park in Ann Arbor, Michegan. His dad, Newell, was a teacher, his mum Louella, who died in 1996, a secretary. Iggy looks just like his dad. A clever boy surrounded by kids who were less well-educated - 'economically and socially I was in a funny spot' - Iggy never fitted in. When he went to a posh junior high and was put into a class with kids whose parents were architects, lawyers, ran technical companies, Iggy freaked. Plus, as he points out, 'most kids with successful parents are indulged and given freedom. I was not'; Mr Osterberg, an ex-military man, was a very strict disciplinarian. It wasn't until Iggy played drums in a talent show that he began to enjoy himself; when he finally left school, he lasted one term at university before rebelling utterly and forming The Stooges. At first sight, he seems to have spent the rest of his years in total rejection of his childhood, to the extent of taking his only son, Eric, born when Iggy was in his early twenties, out with him to clubs and gigs when Eric was barely in his teens. (Eric himself ended up with addiction problems, and the two have had 'a rocky few years', says Iggy; he has not met his baby granddaughter as yet). However, Iggy is close to his own dad, and I suspect that Newell's discipline has stood him in good stead. He is still work-driven, still studious. </p> <p>There are a lot of books in his house. 'Though I'm not sure I bring my intelligence to bear on my music. I know some clever people in this business that make successful music, but they're not my favourites. I think, OK, but that's just clever, you know?' Cleverness is not enough for Iggy; he's too smart for that. Which makes me wonder which way he's going to vote in the US elections. He has only voted once before, and he was forced into that. Virgin records, who had just given him a record deal, were promoting Rock the Vote, and he made a few ads for them. A journalist spotted that Iggy wasn't even registered to vote, so he did, and voted Clinton - 'even though I knew he was a crook'. He is registered this time, but won't say directly who he's going to vote for; it sounds as though he's a natural Kerry sympathiser, but is disappointed. 'I wish Kerry would just come out and say, 'You know what, if I'm President, I'll just get us the fuck out of Iraq'. Something positive. But he won't. And people see Bush like they see a class bully: I don't really like this guy, but it's impressive how he throws his weight around.' And of course, this is Florida. Election results aren't exactly reliable. </p> <p>'No. The way Bush talks, I think he could use the same rhetoric that he used to justify an illegal intervention, to stop losing an election. You know: \"OK, we made a mistake in the voting process, but the country really needs us to save it.\"' Why do you think everyone loves you, Iggy? 'I dunno. They say I'm not a sell-out, but maybe I just wasn't sold to the people who don't think I sold out. Dudes come up to me, totally harnessed-in dudes, you know the type, and say, 'Hey, I like your stuff', and they walk away and I think, you ain't got a mother-fucking album!' And he laughs his manic laugh, smart, sweet, free-thinking, hard-working, caring but not caring, tough but vulnerable. The world needs Iggy Pop to save it, not stupid politicians. I think we can persuade him to carry on. Let's all buy his next record, and keep him around. Who'd want an Ig-free world?</p>",
  "The last streets of flat-roofed houses of the al-Shuhada district of Falluja peter out into unpaved roads that make their way between the fields to the villages populated by the Zawbi tribe. <p>Under cover of darkness, the fighters of Falluja's resistance creep across this landscape, moving men and weapons from safe houses in the villages towards Shuhada, towards the battle for Falluja. </p> <p>Early yesterday it was US Marine vehicles that were heading into Shuhada, turning out of their forward operating base - a walled former resort of low bungalows round a lake known to Iraqis as 'Dreamland' - for a house raid that US military sources say netted a 'senior leader' in the network run by Jordanian terror mastermind Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, along with five others. He was named as Abdel-Hamid Fiyadh, 50, who was arrested along with his two sons, Walid, 18, and Majid, 25, and three relatives. </p> <p>For a year and more, this is how the war in Falluja has been conducted: at night, raids by American troops seen largely through the green shimmer of their night-vision goggles; by day, block searches and vehicle checkpoints. </p> <p>On the insurgents' side, it has been prosecuted with an equal, if covert, vigour among the back lanes and along the quiet lanes to the south that act as supply routes between other centres for the rebellion. </p> <p>But it is the city itself and districts such as Shuhada that are the centre of gravity of the insurgency, along with the densely concentrated al-Askari neighbourhood on the Euphrates to the city's east, and the district of Johan in the city's north-west. </p> <p>After a year and a half of gun battles, artillery and tank fire and bombing raids, many of the houses of Shuhada are scarred. But Shuhada is on the brink of even greater violence as US and Iraqi forces mass for what they hope will be the definitive battle of the Sunni Triangle. </p> <p>How that battle unfolds will not only hold the key to Iraq's elections in January, and to a joint US-British military strategy, but to the life of Margaret Hassan and perhaps to how history will judge the actions of both George Bush and Tony Blair. </p> <p>It is a battle that will be fought among the metal shops off Highway 10, where it carves into the city of 300,000. It will be fought along the highway itself that neatly bisects Falluja and, eventually, it will be fought in the warren of narrow, filthy lanes of the slums that sit by the Euphrates, where fighters, at first largely from the al-Buesa tribe, first began their rebellion. </p> <p>Even when journalists could still visit the fighters in Falluja, this was a threatening place, where lookouts would stand on the street corners to warn of American troops and other 'spies'. </p> <p>Now the state of the insurgency in Falluja is largely unknown, save that it has taken deep root in the 'City of Mosques' and its surrounding villages, despite claims by the US military that they have waged a bloody campaign of attrition that has bitten deeply into the leadership of both the insurgents and their allies in Zarqawi's militia network. </p> <p>What is equally uncertain is whether US Marines are capable of bringing Falluja back under control without the massive loss of civilian life that accompanied their last major excursion into the city in April, or without large loss of American lives. </p> <p>It is a moot point. For in the run-up to planned elections in Iraq in January, US forces cannot risk rekindling the sense of outrage that joined Sunni and Shia and Kurd when confronted with the death toll in this city. </p> <p>It is for this fight that British troops of the Black Watch are being brought north into Babil province to release more US Marines for the fight. </p> <p>According to military sources, this time the battle will be different - although there is no evidence of that so far from the bombing raids that have been levelled against districts like Shuhada in the past few weeks which, say the city's doctors, have already claimed many lives. </p> <p>This time military planners say the US Marine assaults will be led by special forces, who will pinpoint insurgent positions as they move through the city block by block, pushing the fighters back until they are stopped by the river and trapped by a cordon around the city. </p> <p>That is the theory. Iraq has a nasty habit of turning the theories on their heads. Nowhere more so than here. </p> <p>Falluja was always a disaster waiting to happen. A deeply religious and socially conservative city with a tradition of Baathism, it had been one of the main recruiting areas of Saddam's security forces, including the Republican Guard. </p> <p>When these were disbanded after the fall of the regime, a large proportion of the city's men were excluded from the new Iraq. </p> <p>It was compounded by another problem. Despite the fact there had been no fighting in Falluja, and the city had negotiated its surrender without the looting that had been seen elsewhere, when American troops did move into Falluja it was to preside over an almost immediate disaster. </p> <p>Sixteen Iraqis were killed and dozens more were injured after the American soldiers opened fire on a demonstration. </p> <p>It was the first in a series of fatal misjudgments that allowed the insurgency to establish a foothold in Falluja. In an experiment that would have far-reaching consequences, American troops retreated from their positions inside the city, relocating to two substantial bases on its outskirts. </p> <p>Rapidly, the fighters in Falluja took advantage of the American withdrawal, using it as cover to ambush US patrols with bombs, sometimes even as they left their gates. </p> <p>By the beginning of the year, those attacks were becoming ever more auda cious, culminating in the downing of a Chinook helicopter full of US troops and the murder of a group of American contractors whose burnt and mutilated bodies were hung from a city bridge. </p> <p>The response was the first serious attempt to pacify the city in April, an operation that left hundreds of Iraqis dead, many of them civilians, with little impact on the insurgency. </p> <p>If that was serious enough in its own right, a worse misjudgment was over the nature of the insurgency itself. For months, despite all the evidence to the contrary about its high level of organisation, senior US officers convinced themselves that the attacks were the work of a few dead-enders, foreign fighters or criminals in the town. And they consistently underestimated the numbers of those fighting them. </p> <p>New assessments have radically altered that picture. Across Iraq, US military intelligence officials conceded to the New York Times on Friday, the estimated numbers of fighters now stand at between 8,000 and 12,000, perhaps 20,000 when active sympathisers are included. </p> <p>They are assessments that contrast sharply with earlier intelligence reports, in which the number of insurgents has varied from as few as 2,000 to a maximum of 7,000, with 400 in Falluja. </p> <p>What US military planners now recognise is that the fighters in Falluja could number many more. And, as The Observer reported last weekend, the insurgents have access to huge sums of money from an underground financial network run by former Baath Party leaders and Saddam Hussein's relatives operating from Syria and elsewhere. </p> <p>All of which raises serious new questions over the nature of the insurgency: has it grown out of plans laid down in advance for Iraqis loyal to the old regime to continue the fight? Was the battle for Falluja, in many respects, always destined to happen? </p> <p>The biggest question is how hard the men of Falluja and their allies will fight and whether they will try to make their stand as definitive a turning-point for Iraqis sick of the US 'occupation', just as the American forces hope that it will be for their own project in Iraq. </p> <p>Fort Carson, south of Colorado Springs, is known as the 'Mountain Post'. It is home to 3rd Armoured Cavalry Regiment, 3rd Brigade, 7th Infantry Division, and the 43rd Area Support Group. It is also home to a group of men whose reported deployment soon to Iraq threatens to have a significant bearing on Falluja's future. </p> <p>The 10th Special Forces Group has for years been catapulted into action from its base in the Colorado mountains. Now, according to US reports, more than 1,000 of them are heading for the Middle East, amid official reluctance to discuss where they are going or what they will be doing. </p> <p>Speculation has been mounting, however, that such a large movement of the Green Berets, with their specialist snipers, linguists, civil affairs specialists and military intelligence officers, could only be headed for two places - for Afghanistan and an attempt to capture Osama bin Laden or, more likely, to spearhead the fighting inside Falluja, acting as forward air controllers on the ground for US bombers and strike helicopters, and leading the hunt for al-Zarqawi. </p> <p>It is a view that is endorsed by John Pike of the Washington think-tank Global Security. 'The Marine units that are being gathered for the battle are short on laser designation [for guiding air attacks from the ground]. They are significantly under-equipped. A special forces group like this would fill that gap.' </p> <p>Pike believes their deployment , alleged to be within the next couple of weeks, is a possible indicator of the political considerations that surround the timing of a final decisive assault. It must not come so soon that bad news from the battlefield - either in terms of American or civilian casualties - can affect the presidential election. </p> <p>'My guess is that, as soon as the US election count - or recount - starts, you will see an awful lot of action.' </p> <p>But in some respects a campaign has long been under way. Since mid-October the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force has been operating checkpoints around the city, while US jets have launched almost daily raids. </p> <p>The city has been the target of numerous airstrikes by precision-guided missiles destroying suspected hideouts of insurgents. </p> <p>One slim hope remains for the beleaguered citizens of the world's most terrified city. Interim Prime Minister Iyad Allawi has made Falluja an offer they can't refuse, insisting that the city hand over Zarqawi and his fighters. If they fail to do so, they face a brutal military operation. The events in Falluja over the next few weeks will shape the future of Iraq.</p>",
  "<p>China, so we are told, is the world's new growth engine: as its economy develops, its 1.3 trillion people will be sucking up cars, televisions and other essentials of modern life. Its factories are already supplying many of these consumer durables to the rest of us. </p> <p>Investing in China is not easy, however. There are virtually no funds that invest just in Chinese companies, although emerging market and Asian funds will usually have some exposure. Into the gap has come Barclays Global Investors which on Monday will launch an ishare for the FTSE/Xinhua China 25, featuring companies quoted in Hong Kong but which do most of their business in mainland China, such as Petrochina, China Telecom and Guangdong Electric Power. </p> <p>BGI is one of the biggest indexed fund managers, specialising in replicating particular indices for its pension fund and other institutional clients. Ishares bring these skills to retail investors too. </p> <p>Ishares are still unfamiliar here - unlike Americans, who use them as a core part of their portfolio - but they are a useful tool in the retail investors' armoury. Ishares track a given index - BGI's stable includes the FTSE 100 and 250, the corporate bond index and large European companies - but are also shares in their own right so can be bought and sold, in sterling, through any UK stockbroker and have a quotation on the shares page of most daily newspapers. </p> <p>Unlike conventional shares, there is no stamp duty because of the way they are set up, so the only cost is the commission you pay your stockbroker. </p> <p>There is an underlying cost of running the ishare itself, but this is low compared with active funds - 0.74 per cent for the China fund, half that for a specialist fund, which also charges as much as 5 per cent entry fee, while the European and UK ishares are even cheaper at 0.4 per cent. </p> <p>Justin Urquhart-Stewart of 7Investment Management thinks we should all use ishares for the core of our portfolio: the basic asset allocation decisions like whether we invest in Europe or the Far East, equities or bonds. </p> <p>He is particularly enthusiastic about two European ones that will be launched on 1 November, which will cover small- and medium-sized companies, respectively. </p> <p>'Ishares give you low-cost access to something you would want to have in your portfolio, but where few brokers have enough knowledge to advise you on which shares to buy,' he said. </p> <p>European small and mid-caps have been performing well lately. The Chinese market is, however, much riskier. While there is little doubt that it is a long-term growth story, a happy ending for investors is not guaranteed and they will need the stomach for many twists in the tale, in the form of market rallies and routs, on the way. There are already questions about how sustainable the recent rapid growth is and there are constant worries about political stability, particularly as the huge rural hinterland becomes more industrialised. </p> <p>But those prepared to bet on the long-term should consider the ishare for a small part of their portfolio. </p> <p>For more conventional British markets, the arguments are more evenly balanced. </p> <p>The consensus is that shares will remain depressed for at least the next few years so the only way to make money will be to pick the right stocks, just as a few in Cairn Energy did wonders for portfolios over the last year. </p> <p>Ishares, by definition, do not discriminate between stocks, which has made indexed funds and ishares less popular with investors. But there is no guarantee that your fund manager will be able to make the right bets to keep the fund in profit, particularly after his fees are taken into account. It could, therefore, be better to follow Stewart's suggestion and invest a proportion of your portfolio in ishares, picking a few active managers for the rest.</p>",
  "<p>If you did a psychological profile of the corporation, what would it look like? Self-interested, manipulative, avowedly asocial, self-aggrandising, unable to accept responsibility for its own actions or feel remorse - as a person, the corporation would probably qualify as a full-blown psychopath. </p> <p>Sensationalist? Joel Bakan, whose provocative film documentary, The Corporation, is due out at this month and whose book of the same is in the shops (Constable, \u00a39.99), doesn't think so. </p> <p>The opposite of a blunderbuss-wielding Michael Moore, Bakan is a Canadian law professor whose brief is as well-ordered, concise and sober as the accusation is grave: behind its benevolent face, he argues, the most important institution of modern capitalism is a Frankenstein's monster that has broken its chains and is now consuming the society that created it. </p> <p>Three key legal interventions have made the corporation what it is, Bakan says. The first two were the innovations of limited liability and the granting to the corporation of a legal personality. At a stroke, 'the corporate person had taken the place, at least in law, of the real people who owned corporations'. And the company, previously dependent on government grant and charter, could now be seen as an independent being, a 'natural entity' with the same rights to exist as an individual. </p> <p>The corporation turned out to be a work of genius, a brilliant amplifier of capital and effort that has made possible the sensational improvements in living standards (in the developed world) of the past 150 years. But it is a flawed genius, and the flaw, perhaps fatal, is the third enabling condition: exclusive emphasis on profit. </p> <p>This is expressed in the book's subtitle, The Pathological Pursuit of Profit and Power. On the basis of case law, Bakan insists, 'managers and directors have a legal duty to put shareholders' interests above all others' and no authority to serve any other interests - the 'best interests of the corporation' principle. </p> <p>The combination of these three conditions (Bakan could have added a fourth, which is that, unlike a human being, the corporation has no natural life span. It can in effect live and get bigger for ever) has far-reaching consequences. </p> <p>The first is that among the interests the corporation has no business serving are those of the society that framed its governing rules. In the interests of shareholders, the corporation is not only entitled but obliged to offload on to others as many of the costs of making profits as possible. </p> <p>In short, says shareholder activist Bob Monks, quoted by Bakan, the corporation is 'an externalising machine, in the same way that a shark is a killing machine' - not because it's malevolent but because that's the way it is designed. This in turn makes the whole notion of corporate social responsibility a logical nonsense, permissible only when it is in the best interests of the corporation (in which case it's not corporate social responsibility) or when, ironically, it is insincere (ditto). </p> <p>CSR, says Bakan baldly, 'is an oxymoron'. You might just as well ask a great white to be nice to fish or a fox to go vegetarian. When it comes down to it, responsibility always takes second place to shareholder interests, in the name of which corporations constantly test the edges of legality and far overstep those of morality. </p> <p>This truly is a world where, as he says, legal compliance is just another cost-benefit analysis. Bakan has hair-raising and gruesomely entertaining sections on spying, cheating and amazingly unethical marketing devices. He also notes three pages of alleged legal breaches by corporate role model GE; sweatshops turning out goods for Nike and Wal-Mart and American companies' reluctance to cease their involvement in Nazi Germany because it was good business for their shareholders. </p> <p>Extraordinarily, Bakan recounts a fortunately inept but serious (and authenticated) business-backed plan to depose Roosevelt and install a fascist regime in the US in the 1930s. </p> <p>The corporation has been much more successful by persuasion, to the extent that swathes of what used to be the public sphere and interest have been surrendered to it. And it still wants more. </p> <p>But as the dominance grows, so do the flaws. In a nightmare version of the effect of the invisible hand, everyone pursuing their own self-interest increasingly produces results no one wants or intends (in the extreme, planetary collapse), but for which no one is responsible. And the pathologically narrow and materialistic view of human nature that underpins today's corporate form not only dominates economic activity - it is also altering humanity. </p> <p>'In a world where anything or anyone can be owned, manipulated, and exploited for profit, everything and everyone will eventually be,' Bakan warns. The sorcerer's apprentice is running amok; the corporation is remaking us in its own stunted and undersocialised image. </p> <p>This lucid and urgent book does leave a couple of stones unturned. It perhaps overestimates the global hegemony of the US model (although not its fundamentalist zeal for hegemony); shareholders certainly own rights in companies, but the assets themselves? </p> <p>Then again it underestimates, or rather does not address, the formidable extent to which the model is underpinned by dominant academic theory. And, perhaps not surprisingly, Bakan's remedies are less well thought-out than his cool and authorititative analysis. </p> <p>He is, though, undoubtedly right that it's time to destroy the pernicious and self-serving idea of the corporation as a 'natural entity'. It's not. It has a right to exist because society gave it one. </p> <p>The corporation was created as an instrument of public policy, and its licence can still, theoretically, be revoked. The presumption of freedom from regulation is otiose. The corporation needs to be re-made in our image - in law, in theory and in practice. </p> <p><strong>The killer instinct </strong></p> <p>It should not come as no surprise that corporations often operate right at the edge of legality; they are explicitly told there's competitive advantage in pushing it to the limit. </p> <p>Thus, in a Harvard Business Review article (since made into a book), tellingly entitled Hardball: Five Killer Strategies for Trouncing the Opposition, two prominent consultants advised that hardball players (ie winners) systematically probe the narrow strip of territory - 'so rich in possibilities' - between the areas society clearly sanctions and those it clearly outlaws. </p> <p>Since the line that separates the two is often blurred, 'by aggressively pushing the limits of existing regulations, a hardball player can sometimes win tremendous competitive advantages'. </p> <p>In short, business is amoral; its only social obligation is to make money within the law. Any source of competitive advantage is legitimate. So winners will operate closer to the legal boundary than losers. Sometimes they will go over the edge - hence Bakan's list of transgressions. </p> <p>Hence, too, an Enron, which far from being an aberration in this context can be seen as an extreme manifestation of the hardball culture that makes self-interest paramount and invalidates moral concerns - a symptom, as Bakan says, 'of the corporation's flawed institutional character'.</p>",
  "<p>Old hands among the Baghdad media can spot the most obvious warning signs. Sometimes it is the BMW filled with tough-faced young guys that circles the block one time too often, or cruises past you on the road and slows to check your vehicle. </p> <p>It is the middle-aged man who sits all day outside the heavily guarded entrance to your hotel and gets up to follow you when you walk out for the third time that day to get into your car and notes down your licence plate. </p> <p>It is the tracksuited man who followed us around Fallujah like a ghost, the gun in his waistband revealed by a fortuitous gust of wind that opened up his jacket. </p> <p>These are ones who are incompetent or cocky or unlucky. You fear most the watchers you cannot see. </p> <p>The security personnel who work for many of the larger media organisations call this being 'dicked'. </p> <p>It was given a graphic illustration earlier this month with the kidnapping of Australian television journalist John Martinkus, who was released after his captors checked his bona fides on the internet. During his captivity he learned - to his shock - that he had been stalked for three days, without knowing it, before he was snatched. </p> <p>Since April, amid kidnappings and murders of Westerners in Iraq, the 'dicking' of the media has reached such epidemic proportions that few journalists who remain in Baghdad feel either safe or able to function at their job as organisations and individual journalists have voted with their feet and left Iraq. </p> <p>In a process that has echoed the perilous peace after the first Chechen war when kidnapping became rife, Iraq is slowly becoming a story too dangerous to cover. </p> <p>The closure of Iraq to the western media has been a slow and grinding process. Staff have been reduced or withdrawn - at the time of writing Newsweek and Time do not have staff correspondents on the ground - while those that do remain are reduced to operating either with armed guards or are trapped in their hotels. </p> <p>Inexorably, the rest of the country has followed, major road by major road, district by district, until even the short drive from Baghdad International Airport to the city centre has become a lethal lottery. The media in Iraq has been forced to use Iraqi assistants as their eyes and ears, putting Iraqi staff in the front line. </p> <p>It was recently and powerfully described by the Washington Post's indefatigable correspondent Rajiv Chandrasekaran as 'journalism by remote control... deprived of detail, intimacy. Deprived of a degree of reporting depth and on-the-ground observation seen through the eyes of a foreign correspondent.' </p> <p>It is not only Chandrasekaran who felt he had become a prisoner of Baghdad. Recently Farnaz Fassihi of the Wall Street Journal wrote an email that percolated through the Baghdad corps and that summed up the views of many. </p> <p>'Being a foreign correspondent in Baghdad these days is like being under virtual house arrest,' declared Fassahi. </p> <p>'I am house bound. I leave when I have a very good reason to and a scheduled interview. I avoid going to people's homes and never walk in the streets. I can't strike a conversation with strangers, can't look for stories, can't drive in anything but a full armoured car, can't go to scenes of breaking news stories, can't be stuck in traffic, can't speak English outside, can't take a road trip, can't say I'm an American, can't linger at checkpoints, can't be curious about what people are saying, doing, feeling. And can't and can't...' </p> <p>For television crews an assignment in Baghdad is now largely about rooftop 'stand-ups' on their hotel, travel outside the main locations - the Sheraton/Palestine hotel compound and the al-Hamra hotel - is a rarity. Some US networks, including NBC, have long been protected by armed guards - most of them former British Marines. </p> <p>Others, such as CNN, have devised ways of protecting the half-dozen or so foreign staff from various risks that include the chilling scenario of their hotel being overrun by gunmen intent on widespread murder. </p> <p>In December it was possible to 'commute' from Baghdad to cities such as Fallujah, to meet insurgent leaders and cover the story from both sides. Within a few months, however, Fallujah would be closed, and to visit would be to risk disaster. </p> <p>Others have simply left. Tim Lambon is a freelance television producer with a background in security who works largely for Channel 4, often also fulfilling the role of 'safety officer' for his crew. </p> <p>'What makes Iraq so difficult is that people are being kidnapped and killed,' he said last week. 'In this job you take into account the risk from mortars and rockets, but what do you do about a threat like this? </p> <p>'It was bad enough in Beirut in the Eighties when you were looking at throwing away three years of your life as a hostage. But in Iraq these guys are killing people pretty fast and not hanging on to them. </p> <p>'The hostile environment courses used to teach you to deal with this by being the \"grey man\" if you were kidnapped. I went on a refresher recently and the advice is now fight and flight. Even then there is fuck all you can do if two cars pull up and box you in front and back.' </p> <p>Lambon is pessimistic about how long journalists can remain under the present conditions, a pessimism that is shared by many, including Mitch Prothero, former bureau chief in Baghdad for UPI and until recently a research assistant for the Committee to Protect Journalists. </p> <p>Prothero is one of those who has recently left, saying: 'As far as I'm concerned you can't cover this story at the moment. Essentially it is all over. It is a terrible choice. It is the biggest story in the world and there is a terrible obligation to cover it. But you don't put just yourself at risk, but your Iraqi staff and anyone who you interview or whose home you visit. </p> <p>'I remember earlier in the year someone from the Coalition Press Information Centre [the US military press centre in Baghdad] saying: \"This is an active combat zone and we don't want to protect you. Either you embed with us or go home.\" Well, now I think I agree. </p> <p>'It used to be the case that the most dangerous thing I felt I could do was sit in a US military vehicle. Now it is the only thing you can really do.' </p> <p>Will I go back? I would like to say yes - because of the Iraqi friends I've made, and because I feel we have a duty to go on reporting what is happening in Iraq. Because it is the biggest story in the world. Because it is what we do. </p> <p>But increasingly my heart and head rejects it.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Sibling rivalries: Boris upsets the twins...</strong><br> </p> <p>Unable to sleep in the early hours of Friday morning, Diary tuned in to BBC1's excellent politics show This Week in time to witness an interesting exchange. Commenting on the furore surrounding Boris Johnson's slur in the pages of the Spectator, Michael Portillo told host Andrew Neil that he didn't think Johnson could hold down two jobs. Furthermore, he suspected that the Spectator's new owners, the Barclays, might share that view. 'I think you may be right!' exclaimed Neil - who, lest we forget, is the brothers' editorial supremo. Does he know something we don't? </p> <p><strong> ,,, while his sister upsets everyone else</strong><br> </p> <p>It has been a bad week for the Johnsons. Boris's sister Rachel pens a column for the Telegraph, where, it pains us to report, she is not much loved by the sub-editors who tirelessly polish her copy. Following her sibling's recent faux pas, Johnson was asked to pen a piece for yesterday's Weekend supplement about the family's propensity for cock-ups, providing Telegraph subs with the perfect opportunity to exact a horrible revenge. The front-page piece was duly headlined 'My Life as a Serial Offender' and the article prefaced with the words 'Rachel Johnson explains how life as a columnist has led her to follow in an unfortunate family tradition by upsetting almost everyone she meets'. Johnson is said to be unamused. </p> <p><strong> Loss of identity</strong><br> </p> <p>There will be much sobbing into champagne glasses in the glitzy world of fashion at the news that Avril Mair, editor of style bible i-D, has left the magazine she has edited for 14 years. Mair insists the departure was amicable and says she plans to do more consultancy work. But Mair's deputy Mark Hooper departed for Esquire last month, leaving the fashion bible rudderless, if no less glamorous. </p> <p><strong> Victoria Regina</strong><br> </p> <p>Victoria Mather, the socialite travel hack who starred in Channel 4's reality-show flop The Dinner Party Inspectors, has landed a new job at Vanity Fair. Mather saw her dreams of becoming a TV star go up in smoke after C4 decided not to commission a second series of the show, but her career as a journalist is taking off. She is leaving high-society rag Tatler to head up a new travel section at the famous American monthly. Mather, who reputedly detests having her name shortened, will continue to be based in London. Congratulations, Vicky. </p> <p><strong> Loan star</strong><br> </p> <p>We return, with some reluctance, to Andrew Neil, who filed accounts at Companies House last week that showed that his company, Glenburn Enterprises, is doing rather well. Neil's group is a small concern and it doesn't have to submit a full return, but Glenburn has \u00a32.7 million in the bank, \u00a3500,000 more than last year. It is also heartening to see that Neil's brother, John, is keeping up the repayments on the \u00a332,000 loan Neil had the good grace to extend to him four years ago, at the generous rate of 5 per cent - only just above the rate of interest and a mere two and a half times the rate of inflation. </p> <p><strong> It's downhill from here</strong><br> </p> <p>An apathetic electorate is a happy electorate. Or so Rupert Murdoch's trusty neo-con economics adviser, Irwin Stelzer, believes. 'I always regard it as a rather healthy sign that about half of Americans don't bother to vote because the government doesn't affect their lives that much,' says the sage-like academic. 'If it's a great snow day in Colorado on 2 November, I think we're going to have a very low turnout - waxing your skis is a lot more important.' </p> <p><strong> Manila envelopes</strong><br> The Financial Times, as editor Andrew Gowers never tires of reminding us, is a global newspaper. So it made perfect sense to move its accounts department to the Philippines, especially as its journalists are forever penning stories about corporations outsourcing back-office functions to the developing world.

  "<p>There is a story, possibly apocryphal, about Prince Charles driving along a country road one Sunday morning and seeing a sign saying 'car boot sale'. 'Strange', he said to his detective, 'why would people want to sell their car boots?' One wonders what the prince would make of eBay, the online auction house that has just announced another record quarter. </p> <p>Profits were up 77 per cent over last year, to $182.3 million. Revenue was up 52 per cent to $805.9m. The UK and South Korea were two of eBay's fastest-growing markets. In this country gross merchandise volume - or the value of goods sold through the site - grew 160 per cent compared with the third quarter of 2003. </p> <p>These are the kind of results that we have come to expect from eBay, one of the few internet companies that has been profitable almost from day one. There are two reasons, I think, for its runaway success: it is providing a service that people really value; and it makes great use of internet technology to provide that service. </p> <p>People often jeer that eBay is just 'a global car boot sale', and of course it is. But the gibe conceals an important truth, which is that goods are worth only what people are prepared to pay for them. In the days before eBay, many things - discarded toys, obsolete computers, accessories for long-lost cameras - were effectively worthless, not because they had no value but because it was impossible to find a person who would pay for them. EBay changed that at a stroke by providing a mechanism for buyers and sellers of virtually anything to find one another. </p> <p>And the strange thing was that initially it appealed more to non-techies than to techies. I remember four years ago showing the site to an elderly woman friend - someone who is about as technophobic as it is possible to be. She loathes computers, but is passionately interested in old porcelain. The moment she saw what people were selling on eBay, she was hooked. And has been ever since. </p> <p>There are millions like her, all over the world - which is what has fuelled eBay's growth. As the numbers of people using it grew, the service began to change not only people's lives but the way many of them do business. It has transformed the crafts market, for example, or the segment of it that uses market stalls, fairs and small stores as vending outlets. </p> <p>Why would you pay good money in rental fees and stand all day in the freezing cold to sell your wares if you could sell them online from the comfort of your home? Of course, this hasn't wiped out real-world craft markets and fairs, but it has added a whole new set of possibilities for people who want to retail their wares. </p> <p>This trend towards using eBay as a DIY retail outlet is exemplified by the growing number of items on the site that have a 'Buy It Now!' tag. This means that they are not being auctioned, but simply sold as they would be in a conventional retail store. </p> <p>Another interesting development is the way companies - including very large ones - now routinely use eBay as a way of disposing of unsold inventory. Sun Microsystems, for example, has experimented with selling end-of-line servers and other kit this way. And eBay has become the first port of call for most of my techie friends when they are looking for something, especially if it's been on the market for more than a few months. </p> <p>When eBay started, sceptics thought it would be overwhelmed with fraud. How could one possibly have a trading site in which complete strangers trust one another enough to make commercial transactions? Yet although there is some fraud on eBay,it seems to be relatively rare. And the main reason for this is the use of software that builds a profile - or a reputation - for every buyer and seller, based on feedback from those who have dealt with them in the past. </p> <p>Every time you complete a transaction on eBay, you are asked to leave feedback on the person with whom you have just done business. The resulting profiles become very important in deciding whether to bid for an item. If you want to succeed on eBay, therefore, you have to pay attention to your reputation for reliability, honesty and efficiency. </p> <p>All of which leads one to ask whether this idea could be extended to other walks of life. Suppose, for example, readers could leave feedback in the same way on newspaper reporters, editors or even - dare I say it - columnists. Hmmm... It might be less painful, though, than what Boris Johnson has just been through in Liverpool.</p> <p>john.naughton@observer. co.uk </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.briefhistory.com/\">www.briefhistory.com/</a> footnotes/</p>",
  "<p>Ever since the Man Group, an obscure but self-important City company, took over the Booker Prize, the annual prize-giving has become more and more like the works outing to the casino. Never mind the bookies barking the odds, ruining the lives of harmless writers with trackside jargon and febrile calculations. Never mind the Las Vegas atmosphere - the TV lighting and slinky women, the ubiquitous champagne flutes and the blank-faced minders in dinner jackets - that's just the way we live now.</p> <p>What is truly regrettable about Booker redux is the degree to which otherwise sensible publishing houses, committed to the best writing in the market, now pin their hopes on an event that is, from a cool business point of view, as reliable as a spin on a roulette wheel, conducted in a blaze of intoxicating national publicity.</p> <p>All the best imprints fall for it. This year, there were high rollers from Chatto, Picador, Faber, Atlantic, Sceptre and Picador (again).</p> <p>It's hard to blame them. The dramatic uplift in sales, profile and - holy grail! - turnover bestowed by the Man Booker Prize is too tempting to ignore. But there is, as the adverts say, 'Another Way'. And, oddly enough, it was another admirable literary imprint - Bloomsbury - which set the counter-example this year.</p> <p>This probably happened more by accident than calculation. In years gone by, Bloomsbury has competed with much success alongside its rivals like Chatto, Faber etc. This year, it was not to be. The perverse and baffling omission of Ronan Bennett's remarkable novel, Havoc in its Third Year, from the Booker shortlist meant that there was no formal Bloomsbury presence on the big night.</p> <p>Did the honchos of Soho Square repine? Did the chairman sit in his half-lit library with a bottle of Glenmorangie and a loaded revolver, contemplating an honorable release from shame? I think not. More likely, he was pondering the balance sheets with the satisfaction of the man who has given up an old vice and directed his energies towards better things. This is so because, by an apt coincidence, the week in which Bennett's masterpiece was given the cold shoulder by the bien pensants of our premier literary prize, Bloomsbury was launching a new edition of its internationally popular English Dictionary (\u00a330, pp2,162).</p> <p>Scrabble players and Lynne Truss will note that it contains more than 12,000 new words and definitions (including 'embed' and 'blogosphere'). Less austere than Oxford, Bloomsbury contains maps, photographs and illustrations with numerous entries on cultural organisations from Unesco to Nobel.</p> <p>Sadly, the dictionary has nothing to say about Man Booker, though it does have a witty definition of 'hedge fund'.</p> <p>Leaving aside the etymological wonder of the thing, this volume is seriously big business. On its first appearance, Bloomsbury's lexicon, a significant departure for a company founded to provide good new fiction for the English reading public, was explicitly linked to its Microsoft sponsor and was known as The Encarta Dictionary.</p> <p>Now, after market research, it has sloughed off its old livery and rebranded itself simply as The Bloomsbury English Dictionary. And good luck to it: the new volume will give Oxford, Collins and Longman a run for their money, to the great benefit of the consumer.</p> <p>After some massive investment, this impressive volume will, infallibly, yield reliable Booker-style revenue for years. Moreover, it will do this on a global scale that Man, prattling on about its commercial ambitions in the international marketplace, can only dream about.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:robert.mcrum@observer.co.uk\">robert.mcrum@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p><strong>The Beauty Queen's Guide To World Peace</strong><br> Dan Plesch</p> <p>Politico's \u00a38.99, pp373 </p> <p>We are in a mess. The world's resources are disappearing; global warming will shortly have us canoeing to work; hope for an international order based on the rule of law is disappearing; the gap between the world's rich and poor is widening; and much of the West is littered with radioactive junk. Globalisation and a military revolution have combined to power a worldwide insurgency with al-Qaeda in its vanguard. It's a wonder any of us get out of bed in the morning. </p> <p>Dan Plesch explains the mess we are in like a doctor with extremely bad news. Globalisation, he says, marks not 'the end of history' but the beginning of a unified human story. Unfortunately, it will be a short story with a tragic ending unless we follow his remedy. </p> <p>The Plesch prescription comprises a large dose of idealism washed down with pragmatism. So his strategy draws on the 'millennium goals' agreed by the United Nations in 2000 - prosperity, security, justice and so on - but also on the British army's doctrine for counterinsurgency warfare. The latter, formulated by General Frank Kitson in the 1970s, insists that 'there can be no such thing as a purely military solution because insurgency is not primarily a military activity'. Instead, Kitson said, success requires various key elements, including good intelligence, a high degree of co-ordination of any overall plan, the creation of a favourable political atmosphere allowing the redress of legitimate grievances and a strict adherence to the law by 'the imperial power'. Read that list carefully. Then think about the strategy so far pursued in 'the war on terror'. </p> <p>Most of the book is taken up with careful policy suggestions. They include greater accountability of big business (largely through the restriction of corporations' current limited legal liability), the strengthening of global democracy by having directly elected representatives on global bodies, enforcing existing arms reduction treaties and, most critically, a shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy. </p> <p>The latter can be achieved within two decades, Plesch argues. Once done, we will be free of our dependence on Gulf oil (and nuclear power), free of the threat of global warming and able to tackle the root causes of modern Islamic militancy in the Middle East while also denying terrorists the 'nightmare scenario' targets of the power infrastructure. This is clearly a no-brainer. I doubt Bush or Blair will read this book, but they should.</p>"
