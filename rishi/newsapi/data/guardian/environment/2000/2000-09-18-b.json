  "<p>Germany's Dresdner Bank yesterday sealed a $1.35bn takeover of Wasserstein Perella, in a deal that will turn many of the New York finance house's 500 employees into multi-millionaires. </p> <p>Dresdner said it was setting aside $190m for a \"retention plan\", rewarding Wasserstein's staff for loyalty after the change of ownership. A Dresdner spokesman said: \"We want to keep people in the medium term.\" </p> <p>The deal will create the world's sixth largest adviser on mergers and acquisitions, strengthen Dresdner's position in America and provide a confidence boost for the German group following the collapse of merger talks earlier this year with Deutsche Bank. </p> <p>Dresdner's chairman, Bernd Fahrholz, said the acquisition would \"enhance the global profile\" of the bank: \"Dresdner Kleinwort Benson and Wasserstein Perella are a perfect match.\" </p> <p>Wasserstein has worked on several high-profile corporate deals recently, including AOL's $165bn offer for Time Warner and Wal-Mart's $12bn purchase of the supermarket chain Asda. </p> <p>Dresdner can add extra financing muscle to back deals, and contributes a wider international network of offices. </p> <p>However, some experts were critical. Analyst John Leonard, at Schroders Salomon Smith Barney in London, agreed that the deal will strengthen Dresdner's investment banking unit, particularly in the high yield bond business, but questioned the deal's price. </p> <p>\"But is this the best use of $1.4 bn? I still find it very expensive,\" he said. \"Even a few years out, it could only be making $75m to $80m profits for Dresdner.\" </p> <p>Dresdner admitted that issuing equity to fund the all-share deal would dilute its earnings this year. It will continue to run Wasserstein Perella as an independent unit, chaired by founder Bruce Wasserstein. </p> <p>A former executive at the investment bank First Boston, Mr Wasserstein established Wasserstein Perella 12 years ago. </p> <p>Since then, the business has built a reputation for punching above its weight, attracting a longer list of blue-chip clients than many of its larger rivals. </p> <p>Mr Wasserstein said: \"The creation of Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein is only the beginning of the next phase of development in what will be even more fulfilling times for all employees of the merged investment bank.\" </p> <p>Analysts viewed the deal as an expensive but credible attempt to restore confidence after these earlier merger failures. </p> <p>\"Dresdner has to move forward with its investment banking unit and a small dilution to earnings is irrelevant. </p> <p>\"The value of Dresdner Kleinwort Benson has to keep growing, it's such an important part of the group,\" said analyst James Alexander at Commerzbank in London.</p>",
  "A week ago, before the week that was, we were swilling in surrogate memoirs. Tony's troubles with Gordon: Mo's troubles with Tony: Gordon's troubles with everyone. Palpitating stuff - but not the real thing, nothing to match trouble on the forecourt or (eureka!) a Tory lead at the polls. Pause, though, for the memoir mills have not fallen silent. They still grind on, a vital commentary on current debacle. <p>Andrew Rawnsley is a tried and tested name to Guardian and Observer readers. He's a serious journalist with serious sources. When he writes about Gordon sitting in a minibus listening to one of Tony's big speeches on the radio and heckling away (\"The New Deal is up and running.\" Grunt. \"He didn't want that.\") he oozes credibility. The relationship between PM and chancellor may be more complex than any single book can chart; that's the way with stormy marriages of mind and ambition. But you don't need to see the whole truth to see enough of the truth. This is a partnership which may, originally, have constructed the electoral phenomenon called New Labour. Now it's a liability. </p> <p>We know - from the pages of Rawnsley - who stitched up who over Europe, who sacked whose mates, who fiddled while Mandelson burned, and danced around the bonfire. We know about love and hate. What we don't know (exactly) is who briefed and counter-briefed Andrew so commodiously - and why. Nor, perhaps more pressingly, do we quite know what our heroes are saying about each other in private this morning. </p> <p>\"Someone who has an extremely good claim to know the mind of the prime minister\", you may recall, once caused a bit of a stink when he talked to Rawnsley about Mr Brown's \"psychological flaws\". But do you remember what that someone went on to say? \"If you go through the real disasters of our time in government - EMU, the Geoffrey Robinson affair, ISAs, single parents - I'm afraid they all have a single thread to them: they are coming out of the Treasury.\" An old list in need of updating. Add 75p pension rises. Add the price of petrol at the pumps - in neon lights. </p> <p>Mr Blair has endured a wretched few days, caught short at a Chinese supper in Humberside all unawares of the tumult around him. Did he make a good fist of the crisis? Not according to some astronomically awful opinion poll verdicts. The first 48 hours of the fire were more flailing than fighting. Stephen Byers and John Reid were fed to the flames bearing notably blue touchpaper and notably duff arguments. But in the end the prime minister found his bearings and dug in on a principle which needed to be sustained. In the end he showed the resolve of leadership, gambling and battling through. </p> <p>Where, though, was the man who would be leader through this travail? The chancellor didn't exactly put himself about, merely reiterating the impossibility of disturbing the sanctity of the Budget process a couple of times. When the going got tough, he didn't get going. Blair ran cover for Brown. What would \"someone with an extremely good claim\" make of that? </p> <p>In a well-ordered world, of course, there would be no cause for recrimination. Policies - including petrol pricing - would have been exhaustively debated around the cabinet table, sealed by collective responsibility. But is that quite the way this chancellor works? Hardly: and the original fallout over the euro is worth invoking here. Mr Blair was anxious not to rule out joining in the first term because that was his political judgment. Mr Brown sought unilaterally to sweep such possibilities from the table because that was his economic judgment. Politics: economics. Thus the cake of governance is carved between the two master chefs. Yet it's a totally unreal division. </p> <p>The 75p pension rise was economics to a set formula. Low inflation equals a few coins in your pocket. Don't load on extra largesse because we're trying - perfectly sentiently - to lower dependence on the state pension anyway. But politically it was utterly crass, achieving the precise reverse of sentient policy. </p> <p>And if that's true for pensions, consider the still more awful debacle of the fuel escalator. The chancellor apparently addressed that in his last Budget when he suspended the escalator. Oh no he didn't! Many things - including Opec meetings - happen between Budgets. And they have instant political impact, demanding instant thought. If the ultimate case is green, it has to be made. If it doesn't stick, it has to be made again and again. Politics and economics don't come in separate boxes. They're inextricably mixed. </p> <p>Here, beyond personalities, is the fundamental point needing fundamental action. Briefing ministers were out and about yesterday, dumping on Gordon (who has no great gift for making friends and influencing people). If there's an immediate scapegoat for this shambles, his name is Brown - and there'll doubtless be a deal of pressure on Mr Blair to exact the penalties of blame. Pressure that a weakened prime minister will have to resist, of course. More flailing in the marsh. </p> <p>But the real problem goes deeper than petty jealousies and old scores repaid. It is structural - in the division of the 1997 spoils and the spheres of influence. Chancellors of the exchequer are very important chaps, but they aren't islands unto themselves. They have to be part of the team, the political team. They have to share and consult and bear joint responsibility - to keep their minds, in short, on all of the job. When, structurally, that isn't the case, then disaster follows automatically. </p> <p>Time to take stock. The febrile polls will blow away. William Hague isn't the tiger in anyone's tank. You'd still bet on continuing Labour government (though not, maybe, on a spring election). But one political thing, I think, has changed for good. Gordon Brown will not - in his dreams or in reality - succeed Tony Blair in some genteel pass-the-parcel of power. The aura of invincibility has dropped from him. Look elsewhere for Labour's next leader. The central alliance is bust. </p> <p>That, surely, must prove a blessing in disguise. There's no more crucial relationship in government than the one between No 10 and No 11. When it fractures -see Lawson and Mrs T - everything falls apart. Even if the petrol gaffe hadn't happened, the euro referendum was geared for inevitable desuetude. </p> <p>Only Blair - the politician - can repair Labour's damaged fortunes. Everything hangs on him, because there is no alternative. Mr Brown can help for a while en poste, then survive in due course by moving on to the foreign office or some more peripheral role. Structure matters. It has been the rot inside New Labour thus far. The lesson of the longest week is that it has to be got right now - or else. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:peter.preston@theguardian.com\">peter.preston@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>You probably missed it. It no doubt didn't even register. Maybe you saw it and didn't think twice, but I'm talking about an ad - yep, an ad - that ran on BBC1's Grandstand recently. </p> <p>This particular commercial consisted of a highly entertaining two-minute film starring the rubbery-faced comic Lee Evans learning how to do tae kwon do. There was no endline, no jingles, no evident branding, no nothing. </p> <p>The documentary-style film was, in fact, wholly funded by Adidas and was one of 12 two-minute films starring Evans attempting various athletic feats, created to promote the sports equipment manufacturer's sponsorship of the Sydney Olympics. Known collectively as The Road to Sydney, the films have been branded \"a new Olympic television programming series\" by 180, the international ad agency which created them, and have been sneaking into the programming of TV stations across Europe in the run-up to the Games. </p> <p>Such communication is evidence of a new trend that is rapidly spreading through the global advertising village, known as stealth advertising. It goes beyond straight sponsorship, beyond even advertiser-funded programming: it simply involves advertisers stripping out all overt branding and sneaking under their target consumers' radars far more subtly. </p> <p>Other examples are plentiful. Robbie Williams's latest album Sing When You're Winning has been \"advertised\" via a series of mysterious postage stamp-sized photos of Robbie dressed up in various guises running across the national press. Shots taken from the CD cover itself, featuring a montage of Robbie in the 1966 World Cup-winning pose, have also been leaked into various newspapers' editorial pages. </p> <p>PlayStation2 has similarly been launching itself via a series of non-branded press ads simply consisting weird images of, for instance, a hyper-wrinkled old woman above the line \"I am horse, sinew, muscle and hoof. I am thunder across your land\" without any logo. </p> <p>Significantly, Alan Rutherford, the worldwide head of media at Unilever, revealed at the Guardian Edinburgh International TV festival last month that he had been approached by a Hollywood studio to help finance a movie by providing \"ads\" that would run throughout it, presumably in some fairly subtle or stealthy format. </p> <p>Simeon Roane, the copywriter on the Adidas films, explains his campaign: \"The Road to Sydney films are ads in that their intended purpose is branding for Adidas, but they are not typical advertising, in a 60-second format with a logo at the end. The idea was that they could work even better if they were perceived as programming and if they didn't run in commercial breaks.\" </p> <p>This bold experimentation has been triggered by the advent of such manifold threats to conventional advertising as the unstoppable fragmentation of audiences and the TiVo Box, the new gizmo which will allow viewers to zap out commercials altogether. At the same time, the explosion of TV channels with looser controls and the imminent advent of broadband platforms on the internet are opening up new opportunities. </p> <p>Ben Bilboul, account director at St Luke's, which has dubbed the phenomenon \"climating\", comments: \"Clients are becoming more and more interested in communicating their brand values in a non-advertising way, preferring to fund entertaining or informative communications. Brands themselves are becoming recessive, the idea being that while consumers watch a client's piece of entertainment or an informative film they are culturally steered towards a particular brand.\" </p> <p>One possible scenario might be a food manufacturer commissioning a 60-second piece of programming or film that extols the benefits of cooking with a wok (demonstrating how the food tastes better, it's low fat, speedier than traditional cooking methods, etc). The manufacturer might then bring out a timely selection of wok sauces which will capitalise on the climate established by the film. Stealth advertising is about promoting the values or lifestyle or attitude of the product rather than the product itself. </p> <p>Morven Sloane, senior product manager at Sony Computer Entertainment, who has been masterminding the PlayStation2 stealth launch, endorses this. \"We thought our audience was getting jaded with brands and bog standard advertising - we wanted to do something more challenging that would drive our image as an edgy, alternative games provider. Our launch campaign is more about intriguing opinion formers and making them wonder what the hell is going on.\" </p> <p>Observers of the trend point to the 1986 movie Top Gun as the pioneer of this \"stealth\" communication: both the US air force and eyewear manufacturer Rayban provided significant financial backing and the result was unprecedented sales of sunglasses and a glut of eager air force recruits. The publication earlier this year of a new book by Naomi Klein called No Logo, which includes a chapter specifically on stealth advertising, is doing much to drive the phenomenon. </p> <p>Mike Mathieson, managing director of Cake, a youth marketing consultancy which is experimenting with non-branded work, claims that the trend particularly applies to youth products: \"Our view is that people of our generation don't like being sold to. We look at different ways of getting into people's mindsets without using the typical corporate sell and we are making brands entertaining, even making them into entertainment units.\" </p> <p>There is, however, a fundamental problem with this fudging of overt commercial messages and blurring of advertising and editorial. Any self-respecting newspaper or magazine editor will normally insist on any form of advertisement being clearly stamped as such. The independent television commission, not surprisingly, is also very hot on stealth advertising - a recent two-minute ad resembling a silent music promo to promote BT Youth's new website getoutthere.com came a cropper with the ITC and had to be clearly labelled \"advertisement\". </p> <p> The ITC states darkly: \"Our concern is that it must be very clear to the audience whether they are seeing a paid-for advertisement or a programme. There must be no confusion or interference with the editorial process. If there is any potential for confusion then the film should be clearly labelled.\" </p> <p>The difficulty therefore is in creating a commercial piece of communication that, firstly, is explicit enough to justify the advertisers' money but, secondly, is subtle enough to sneak past the authorities. </p> <p>Adidas feels it has cracked it with its Road to Sydney films, however, which feature no more branding than Evans and his fellow athletes wearing Adidas clothing. The advertiser was easily convinced of the potential of such a ground-breaking approach, claims 180. </p> <p>\"Adidas was happy because the films are not its only existing branding effort - it still has agencies producing traditional commercials. Also, it felt confident because of the two-minute length and the fact that they were entertaining films and people would therefore want to watch them,\" says Roane. </p> <p>PlayStation2's stealth advertising tactic also seems to have paid off: key opinion-formers' interest has been stoked and advance orders for the unit, which launches on November 24, are already set at 200,000. </p> <p>But perhaps an even better indicator of the potential for this sort of communication is the fact that the BBC is considering splicing all 12 Road to Sydney films together to create a 24-minute Adidas \"ad\" which it will happily broadcast. There may well be an essential dilemma lurking at the heart of stealth advertising and a possible gamble with client money involved, but it is perhaps small wonder that agencies are increasingly testing it out.</p>",
  "<p><strong>REBROV FOR THE OFF?</strong></p> <p>He was a brilliant young Ukrainian striker with a passion for goal-scoring and a penchant for ham radio. They were a struggling English mid-table club with delusions of grandeur and a dour Scottish manager. A marriage made up of two complete opposites couldn't work, could it? That's what the Fiver tried to tell everyone. But when Sergei Rebrov signed for Spurs - and not AC Milan, Arsenal or the zillions of other biggish clubs (OK, Rangers) that wanted him - he was positively beaming. Spurs were going places, he insisted, whispering the words \"Big\" and \"Cup\" into the Fiver's outstretched ear. And, for a brief second, we believed him.</p> <p>Once we disabled George Graham's cunning mind scrambler, however, our moment of insanity passed. And now, after Spurs' 1-0 defeat at Charlton this weekend, Graham's influence on poor Sergei seems to be waning too. \"I chose to play for Spurs because I knew of their ambition to become one of the top clubs in Europe again,\" sobbed a distraught Rebrov, as the assembled journalists tried to remember when Spurs really were one of the top clubs in Europe.</p> <p>A quick flick through Rothmans later - \"nope, thought not\" - and the now clued-up press pack resumed their chat with the increasingly disillusioned Rebrov. \"The manager convinced me that this club was going to be challenging for trophies. That's what I want - and I want it soon,\" he said, not unreasonably stamping his feet. \"It is vital that I do it quickly because I am 26 and in the best condition and form of my career. If I can't then I will be unhappy.\" And if Rebrov's unhappy you can bet the Spurs' fans will be unhappy. Which will probably make for another unhappy season at White Hart Lane. Which will probably make Arsenal's George Graham, the Tottenham manager, unhappy too. Won't it?</p> <p><strong>ADVERTISEMENT</strong></p> <p>Free minidish and digibox from Sky.

As his hamstring was yanked from country to country in search of a solution, the one-time goal-scoring and Ronny Johnsen-kicking hero of many an Englishman became a joke figure. But Owen and his twangy hamstring were made of stronger stuff, and this season he charmed his way back into fickle English hearts with a wonder goal against world champions France. He was back and more popular than ever. What a story!</p> <p>Sadly, all his hard work was today undone in an instant when he spoke of his desire to become the new Alan Shearer. Shearer, you may remember, officially became England's most unpopular man during Euro 2000 for being a bit out of fashion (despite being his country's top scorer). \"Shearer scored lots of goals for England and had a great record,\" explained Owen, as the membership numbers of his fan club dwindled alarmingly. \"Now it is up to another striker to try and follow in his footsteps, and that is my main ambition - to play well and score in the big games.\"</p> <p>Owen would like to start the Shearer years of his career - ie: be criticised, go bald, make weak attempts at proving he has a sense of humour - next month against the Germans. \"At this moment I am not worrying about playing for England,\" he swaggered. \"If I maintain my Liverpool form then it is down to Koogan. I believe I am good enough to play in the team and hopefully he'll pick me.\" And if you prove to him that you can hold your right arm up at exactly the same angle every time you score a goal, we're sure he will.</p> <p><strong>THE RUMOUR MILL</strong></p> <p>Ajax striker Tijani Babangida is poised to join Charlton, according to reports in Holland.

  "<p>Many predictions have been made of violence from the protesters gathering in Prague this week ahead of the autumn meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). But there is more on their websites about banner-making than about gas masks. Since the dramatic scenes in Seattle last November, there has been a tendency to pour scorn on the demonstrators' incoherent critique of globalisation. But that misses the bigger point. Their demonstrations sent shockwaves through governments and they succeeded in focusing attention on issues such as the legitimacy of the IMF, and the clash between World Trade Organisation rules and UN environmental conventions. It is paying off. A dramatic shift is developing in the climate of discussion and policy-making on globalisation. </p> <p> Evidence for this can be found in two reports published last week. The more important is the Bank's World Development Report. It acknowledges revolutionary concepts, such as the fact that economic growth does not automatically reduce poverty, and states that inequality is bad for growth. Most controversially, it recognises that poverty is not simply an economic problem but a polit ical one. Sadly, many aid agencies have belittled the Bank's shift, preferring condemnation to the slow, difficult process of reform. </p> <p>One of the Bank's toughest critiques is of the world's trading system - it claims that $63bn a year is lost by poor countries due to agricultural protectionism - and trade is also the subject of a report published last week by the Performance and Innovation Unit (part of the Cabinet Office). Here, for the first time, the UK government is grappling with the issues identified by demonstrators and non-governmental organisations. For example, it acknowledges that there are serious environmental costs to trade liberalisation. This honesty surfaces only in the text; unfortunately, the recommendations can be broadly summarised as a smug business as usual. That trick will not wash in the white paper on globalisation being drawn up in the Department of International Development and due out on the first anniversary of Seattle. The pressure is mounting on the policy makers to produce convincing responses to the accusations which will be aired in Prague over the next fortnight that global capitalism is failing the vast bulk of the world's population.</p>",

BSkyB is confident it will be renewed. </p> <p>NMM reported that Warner Brothers was planning to withdraw its top films from Sky's movie channels and was considering launching a movie channel in the UK in association with other studios.

  "<p>John Maynard Keynes, one of the founding fathers of the World Bank and the IMF, once toasted economists as \"trustees, not of civilisation, but of the possibilities of civilisation.\" </p> <p>As the bank and the fund begin their protest-ridden annual meeting in Prague, it is worth asking whether today's economists are living up to Keynes' dictum. We have seen that the idea that planned economies provide an economic utopia where civilisation can flourish is nonsense. Nevertheless, the Thatcher claim that liberalised financial markets are always efficient and are mankind's only hope for economic and social progress has also seen to be wanting. </p> <p>Many have been searching for a \"third way\" occupying the middle ground in the place of the polar views of planning vs laissez-faire. This \"third way\" hunt has become the conventional wisdom for Britain's \"New Labour\" and Germany's \"New Social Democrats\". Having apparently seen the writing on the wall, Gordon Brown is encouraging some contingency economic thinking. His Royal Economic Society lecture earlier this year and the fact that the Treasury has started to hold private seminars titled \"Keynes in the 21st century\" indicates that this Labour government's third way includes a search for resurrecting Keynes' civilising economic principles and policies. </p> <p>Unfortunately, Keynes' argument for remedying the serious flaws of our entrepreneurial economy without destroying the spirit of enterprise or the promotion of a civilized society is not well understood by the Bank of England or the Treasury. </p> <p>If Keynes was alive today and the chancellor invited him to address one of the Treasury's private seminars, Keynes would stress the following points. </p> <p>\u0095 The \"outstanding faults\" of an entrepreneurial society are its failure to provide sustained full employment and its arbitrary and inequitable distribution of income and wealth. </p> <p>\u0095 The failure to provide sustainable full employment is not due to supply-side market imperfections such as monopolies or rigid wages. Policies designed to increase wage-price and exchange rate flexibility while liberalising financial markets may well exacerbate unemployment. </p> <p>\u0095 Government's responsibility is to \"exercise a guiding influence\" on private spending decisions to ensure that there is never a persistent lack of effective demand. Government operating budgets should be balanced. If private spending fails to produce full employment (especially if entrepreneurial exuberance fades), government should run a capital account deficit to employ resources to produce, with the cooperation of private initiative, additional productive facilities. </p> <p>\u0095 Unemployed workers and excessive idle capacity is a \"public scandal of wasted resources\". The ultimate cause of such a scandal is nested in the human weakness of speculation and an obsession with liquidity. A necessary condition for solving the unemployment problem involves damping destabilising financial speculation to assure orderly financial markets and providing cheaply all the liquidity that entrepreneurs can use. </p> <p>\u0095 Liquidity is a double-edged sword. The good cutting edge is that by providing an orderly market where financial assets can be readily resold encourages savers to provide funding to entrepreneurial investments. Without liquidity, the risk of funding investments as a minority owner would be intolerable. The \"bad\" edge of the sword is that if a strong bearish view develops, the resulting demand for liquidity impedes the production of new investments even when real resources are available to be employed. </p> <p>In November, Lord (Robert) Skidelsky's third volume of his biography of Keynes, Fighting For Britain, will be published. I advise the chancellor to read Skidelsky's biography to see how these five principles were used by Keynes to develop policies that promoted the possibilities of civilization for postwar Britain and the global community. </p> <p>Paul Davidson is Holly chair of excellence in political economy at the University of Tennessee</p>",
  "<p> Two of the most conspicuous newspaper success stories of recent years have built circulation not through titillation but from the sober concern of business news. In the past year, the FT's circulation has gone into overdrive, adding around 73,000 copies to bring its total daily figure to 459,000 - an increase of almost 19%. Sunday Business is 14% higher than a year ago, with summer sales levelling off at 60,000. The company maintains that advertising revenues are rocketing. </p> <p>The impending launch of Business AM in Scotland has generated much debate about the need for another financial paper in a limited market. But the climate could hardly be better. The newspaper's existence is a product of the extraordinary explosion of interest in all things financial that has spawned not only new papers, but online services, TV channels, magazines and beefed-up attention in mainstream media. </p> <p>The Guardian, which traditionally had an ambivalent relationship with the Square Mile, added pages to its financial section last year, while Greg Dyke made business coverage a priority at the BBC. The media's heightened interest in finance reflects the growing awareness that real power is shifting from politicians to big business. What Rupert Murdoch or Wal-Mart are up to can have as profound an effect on our lives as many political decisions. </p> <p>During the BMW/Rover affair, it quickly became clear who was in control despite Westminster handwringing. Newspaper editors have been forced to reassess the traditional view that politics is the priority on the news agenda. </p> <p>The genesis of public involvement in share ownership was the large-scale privatisation of the Thatcher era. In the 90s, that was cemented by the windfalls from demutualising building societies and insurers. According to the department of social security, a third of Britons now own shares. </p> <p>Interest has also been raised by widespread home ownership, providing many with a sizeable lump sum of capital for the first time - another Thatcher legacy. Cash in the bank and a private pension invested in the stock market produces a vested interest in the economy and sharpens your interest in the financial pages. </p> <p>Jeff Randall, editor of Sunday Business, says the creeping changes in attitude set the scene for the launch of the paper two and a half years ago. \"We unearthed a market most people didn't believe existed because they misjudged the massive social shift in Britain towards interest in business and ownership of shares,\" he says. \"Even my minicab driver has shares in BT, Norwich Union and the Woolwich.\" </p> <p>The internet goldrush has brought a younger, sexier type of businessman or woman into the frame - think Martha Lane Fox rather than the middle-aged balding pinstripe of old. John Penman, Business AM editor, and a former political editor of the Scotsman, says: \"At conference at the Scotsman, the business editor used to come in and nobody would understand what he was talking about - it was like a masonic code. But that's not right because business affects everyone. Where TV shows like Working Lunch have got it right is by making the subject accessible. In Sweden, share ownership is up to 65% of the population and they refer to business as the new rock'n'roll.\" </p> <p>Financial information can now be sourced from a seemingly endless stream of online services such as Thestreet.co.uk, Interactive Investor International and Breakingviews.com. The internet is also playing an increasing part as an easy medium for buying or sell ing shares. For many, going into a stockbrokers would be akin to going into a bookies or a sex shop - a little off-putting. The other recent success has been the influx of US business magazines including Forbes Global and Business Week which have been steadily building circulation. Deregulation of the financial services industry has also created a vast advertising base to support new titles whether they are well read or not. </p> <p>If any doubts were left that finance had gone mainstream, they were dashed by the Sun and Mirror which earlier this year staged an extraordinary battle on their front pages attacking each other's City sections. The Mirror's City Slickers played a notable part in encouraging a punt on the stock market and their downfall of investing in their own tips also proved another point: business can provide some ripping yarns.</p>",
  "<p>In a bewilderingly topsy-turvy week - when the Daily Mail showed sympathy for picketers and the usually supine Mirror snarled at New Labour - the easiest task for the tabloids was deciding whom to cast pictorially as villains. By Friday, when two of them had put up prices, oil company bosses belatedly became public enemy number one, with the Mirror devoting a spread to mugshots of the guilty quintet and even the Mail (not normally known for its attacks on capitalists pursuing profit) depicting Esso's chief exiting No 10 after a \"carpeting\". </p> <p>Competing for the arch-villain role was John Prescott, seen fuming and fidgeting when cross-examined on GMTV in Thursday's Sun - which devoted most of a page the following day to his battered, exhausted face - and \"taking to his heels\" after the disastrous TV interview in the Mirror. Photographed smirking smugly in Friday's Mail, but only as part of an assemblage of crisis images, Gordon Brown got off surprisingly lightly; he figured, however, in the front page photomontage of Wednesday's Mirror, portraying Blair, Brown and Prescott as a troika of inept, impotent fools, their heads atop empty petrol pumps. </p> <p>Equally easy was casting the public as long-suffering heroes and heroines, stoically struggling to work despite queues, jams and shortages: nurses filling up at garages were much in evidence, closely followed by commuters using fossil fuel-free forms of transport such as unicycles, rollerblades and even a sedan chair. </p> <p>Trickier was knowing how to present two key images: the pickets and - bearing in mind that all the London tabloids urged their readers to vote for him - Tony Blair. The shots of a grim Blair at his crisis press conferences were virtually identical, but what did they express: determination and decisive leadership, or frustrated recognition of having been caught on the hop? Perhaps regretting having given the government the image it wanted of tankers at last on the move on Wednesday, unlike the mutinous Mirror, the Sun used the PM's face on its front page on both Thursday (\"Blair Crisis Deepens\") and Friday (\"60 Days to Sort it Tony\"). No paper, however, dared to give him the Prescott treatment: the Mirror came closest on Tuesday with the week's strongest front-page image - also used uncredited by the Sun on an inside page - showing his Jaguar speeding insouciantly past a petrol station queue. </p> <p>As for the pickets, although the Mail's editorial line condemned civil disobedience, its photographers had clearly been instructed to shoot them favourably: in a Wednesday article by Glenda Cooper, for example, words (\"A Very British Blockade: They talked of summer holidays, Radio 4 and why they feel New Labour has betrayed them\") and cheery yet resolute faces combined to convey an unequivocal message - these are our sort of people. The same approach was evident in the photo of a protesting mother and son accompanying leader-page rumblings (\"A Very Middle Class Revolt\") by Simon Heffer; and it reached its apogee in Thursday's extraordinary front page. Suspiciously convenient - was it a single fortuitous shot, or \"staged\", or two shots spliced together? - this showed a smiling father carrying a fist-waving young son on his shoulders, next to placards reading \"Support British Agriculture\" and (markedly smaller) \"Justice For UK Hauliers\". </p> <p>This was a rightwing version of socialist realism, its pose ironically familiar from many a poster appealing for solidarity with such foes of the Mail as striking miners. Significantly, though, the paper portrayed the alliance of farmers, hauliers and motorists in the most heroic light precisely at the moment when it was telling them to stop: above the image, the vatic voice of \"Daily Mail Comment\" urged an end to blockades \"while you still hold the moral high ground\". </p> <p>Every tabloid picture of last week's crisis told an ideological story, with expression, caption and surrounding text combining to leave the reader in no doubt how to view the person depicted. In the broadsheets, in con trast, photos were secondary and illustrative, and every effort was made to purge them of political messages, largely by favouring inanimate scenes of chaos - convoys, parked tankers, petrol-less garages, empty supermarket shelves - with no tell-tale faces from whose expressions the paper's stance could be inferred. This policy was taken to extremes in the Telegraph, which turned its fuel crisis pages into a dehumanised visual wasteland and, when it could bring itself to photograph picketers, bafflingly preferred to view them from the rear. No broadsheet showed Blair's Jag passing the petrol queue. </p> <p>Challenged by tabloids turning their front pages into anti-government posters to come up with something equally striking, the broadsheets offered neutral images - a map (Independent), the feet of a man filling jerry cans (Times), a petrol pump's last drop (Guardian). When the latter was nicked by the Mirror the following day, it had inevitably acquired a message, with Piers Morgan strangely finding himself singing from the same hymn sheet as the Mail's Paul Dacre in telling the blockaders \"Enough is Enough\". </p> <p>This is not to say that comment was studiously restricted to text in the quality press, of course, as the art of the political cartoon (virtually extinct in the tabloids) is still flourishing in the broadsheets. And it was in these cartoons that the only negative images of the picketers were to be found. The Independent's Dave Brown portrayed a crazed haulier holding a petrol pump/gun to the head of a tied-up planet Earth (\"Cut the price . . . or I won't be able to blow his brains out\"). A Peter Brookes cartoon in the Times showed the lorry of a sinister, thuggish trucker dwarfing a petrified bunny with the face of Tony Blair. And Steve Bell in Thursday's Guardian produced the most hostile image of all, depicting a scowling bunch of picketers as \"Fat Blokes United in Disgruntlement\". Identified by the Daily Mail as decent middle-class folk who naturally took the Mail, they here became surly, red-top-reading morons.</p>",
  "<p>After two decades spent living in the public eye, the final act of Paula Yates had no audience. It was a tragic end to what was to the outside world a glamorous, if turbulent, life of sex, drugs and rock'n'roll stars. </p> <p>Since 1982, pretty much everything she did had attracted headlines, often at her own behest. But the media maelstrom around Yates grew so much more intense after a chat in bed with the rock star Michael Hutchence. </p> <p>She had interviewed the Australian frontman of the band INXS for Channel 4's Big Breakfast programme, made by a production company owned by her husband, Bob Geldof. With their legs entwined, the mutual attraction that would consume and destroy her marriage to Geldof was obvious to those watching. </p> <p>Yates became famous as the front woman of the Tube, the groundbreaking Channel 4 music programme. She was hired for the job by Andrea Wonfor, the show's executive producer: \"Everything changed after she met Michael Hutchence. She threw everything away and found nothing left after he died.\" </p> <p>In 1982 Yates, then 22, burst on to television screens. With her blonde hair and low-cut, tight dresses, she came across as a wild child. The reality, says Ms Wonfor, was very different. </p> <p><strong> Restrained</strong><br> </p> <p> Compared to the later stories of drugs and drink, her time at the Tube was relatively restrained as she soon became pregnant with her first child: \"For the whole five years of the Tube, Paula was the bloody boring one. She'd go to bed at 9.30pm, when everyone else was in the bar, and be back up at 6.30am to take Fifi for a swim,\" Ms Wonfor remembers. </p> <p>Yates began dating Geldof, the frontman of the band the Boomtown Rats, in 1977. She was determined to have him and stuck so close to him that other band members called her \"the limpet\". </p> <p>Paula and Bob were one of the most fashionable couples of the 1980s, but their paths to the outside world were diverging. She, to some, appeared narcissistic and shallow, happy only in the world of celebrity and rock stars. He went off to fight famine in Africa and became \"Saint Bob\" after masterminding Band Aid. </p> <p>Their marriage was dogged by persistent rumours of Geldof's infidelity and from their public utterances Geldof and Yates had different expectations about their relationship, and about the role of passion. \"To live your life in a state of passion would be tedious because everything is distorted. It is extremely dull and limiting. Sexual passion burns out,\" Geldof once said. </p> <p>Seven months before she left Geldof, Yates told an interviewer she thought of herself as a \"steaming Jezebel given half an opportunity. Why can't I be? Why can I only be this great lactating person?\". </p> <p>Asked if she was storing up an emotional time bomb, she replied: \"It probably is, and I say to Bob it will be terrible. It will be like the Exorcist.\" </p> <p>By February 1995 she had found her source of passion and left Geldof for Michael Hutchence. But she would pay a terrible price for bagging what she called \"God's gift to women\" and a man who possessed the \"Taj Mahal of crotches\". </p> <p>Geldof was determined not to surrender custody of their three daughters, Fifi Trixibelle, Peaches and Pixie, and the bitterness of the split sapped the joy she found with Hutchence, whom she had fallen for deeply. \"She did really love Michael, she was mad about him,\" said a friend last night. But it was Hutchence who introduced Yates to a drink- and drug-fuelled lifestyle: \"That's when the spiral of decline started,\" the friend said. </p> <p>The break-up with Geldof was acrimonious and detailed by the tabloids, with Yates's connivance. She went to the house they had shared in Chelsea and after shouting abuse at him, threw a rock through a window. Friends were authorised to leak details of the bitter wrangle and Yates's financial straits as her debts at one stage reached \u00a3100,000. </p> <p>In May 1996 the divorce was granted, and Geldof later won temporary custody of the children after a sweet tube containing opium was found at the home of Yates and Hutchence. They claimed it was planted. </p> <p>If the fallout from her relationship with Geldof left Yates emotionally drained, the bizarre death of Michael Hutchence as good as broke her. The singer was found hanging in a Sydney hotel room in November 1997, having consumed vodka, beer, champagne, cocaine, Prozac and other prescription drugs. Yates could never accept it was suicide. The couple had a daughter, Heavenly Hiraani Tiger Lily, who is now four years old. She described his death as like being \"flung to the dogs\", and tried to find comfort in Tiger Lily. </p> <p>Yates branded Geldof \"a killer\" after it emerged Hutchence had hanged himself with a leather belt hours after pleading with the former Boomtown Rat over the custody of Yates's daughters with Geldof. </p> <p>Yates later told an interviewer: \"When Michael died I was tipped over the edge. I was beyond grief. I went completely mad. </p> <p>\"Now I'm starting, relatively, to think straight again. I live one day at a time, one hour at a time. What makes it all worthwhile is my children.\" </p> <p><strong> Rapid decline</strong><br> </p> <p> Yates had to deal with more torment when it emerged that the man she thought was her father, the former Stars on Sunday star Jess Yates, was not. Her mother had had a relationship with the TV presenter Hughie Green and DNA tests showed that he was her real father. </p> <p>Her decline became more and more rapid. She was admitted to a psychiatric hospital with depression and in June 1998 lost custody of her three daughters from her relationship with Geldof and, though to the outside world apparently effervescent, tried to end it all. A friend found her and she was admitted to a clinic. </p> <p>Even there Yates found no stability. She began an affair with a heroin addict, which attracted more lurid tabloid headlines. The stories provoked Hutchence's family in Australia into proceedings to gain custody of Tiger Lily from Yates. When Yates ended the relationship, Hutchence's family dropped the lawsuit. </p> <p>Yates was again in the headlines when she had a relationship with the rock star Finlay Quaye. And in 1999 it was reported that she had collapsed while her daughters with Geldof were staying with her, and that police had to take the children away. </p> <p>Ms Wonfor, with whom Yates and her children stayed last year, said: \"There was a culmination of the madness that overtook her with Michael's death and the change of her father. She is quite a fragile creature. She probably never grew up and maybe that was to do with her difficult childhood; she needed an arm around her a lot.\" </p> <p>After the death of Hutchence, Yates was angered by news that Tiger Lily would only get \u00a32m from the singer's will and became locked in a dispute with his estate. </p> <p>An attempt at a television comeback flopped and earlier this year she won libel damages from the Mail on Sunday newspaper over claims she had deliberately and \"deceitfully\" become pregnant with Hutchence to try and ensnare him in a permanent relationship. </p> <p>She found no let-up at the Notting Hill home she moved to last year, where she was pursued by a stalker. </p> <p>Paula Yates made an art of getting what she desired: Geldof, fame, children and Hutchence. But ultimately, she could not get what she wanted: peace of mind. </p> <p><strong> 1959 </strong> Paula Yates born to former Bluebell Girl Heller Toren.

  "<p>They call Wensleydale James Herriot country, but they are wrong. It's actually God's own country. Broad in the east, the valley of the river Ure becomes narrower as it heads westward deep into the Pennines and the best hill walking in England. But most people need a car to get there. </p> <p>It was not always so. Up until the 1950s, Wensleydale had its own railway, a branch line connecting Northallerton on the east coast line with Hawes Junction on the Settle-Carlisle line. However, the rise of the car as a form of mass transport and the decline of railways meant part of the line closed to passengers in 1954 and the rest followed in 1959. </p> <p>It is not hard to see why people living in Wensleydale are unhappy about rising petrol prices, which tend to be more expensive in the dale than in the more populous parts of the country. With no public transport alternative, higher fuel prices effectively represent a cut in living standards. This is something the local MP, one William Hague, is keen to exploit, posing as the champion of the motorist against a government that has lost touch with middle England. </p> <p>What's more, the government is worried sick that he might succeed. The rhetoric may be tough now, but there will be concessions to motorists and road hauliers in the budget. As it happens, there were concessions in the last budget - described by the AA as the best for the motorist in a decade - although that was conveniently overlooked last week. </p> <p>In the short term this may be justified by electoral politics; in the longer term a retreat from policies designed to raise the cost of pollution will be environmentally disastrous and bad for the economy to boot. </p> <p>The context for the fuel protests is not a world in which motorists are innocent victims, but one in which global warming is leading to a melting of polar ice caps and the threat that rising sea levels will lead to floods in low lying countries such as Bangladesh. Lower fuel prices mean higher demand for petrol and therefore increased C0<sub>2</sub> emissions. </p> <p>That's the bottom line, although there are other knock-on effects from rising car and truck usage - the increase in the number of cases of asthma, for example, or more deaths on the road. The car has killed more Americans than every war in US history; the protests last week appear to have been a real setback for saner environmental policies. </p> <p>There are two reasons why the government is now on the defensive - the less important being that farmers and truckers have a case. Figures show that higher prices are not that effective in cutting consumption, as demand for petrol is inelastic, with an increase in the price of 100% leading only to a 50% decline in usage. </p> <p>It is not hard to see why this is. Public transport is expensive, even when it is available. Not just in the Dales but in the suburbs as well, railway lines reflect the economic geography of the 19th century - heading in and out of city centres (especially London) rather than that of the 20th century, where people often live in one town and work across country. </p> <p>Ironically, many of those branch lines that seemed so anachronistic when Beeching axed them in the early 60s now look a lot more viable. The rail network cannot soak up demand displaced from the roads. Decades of under-investment in public transport means that train companies cannot put on extra services but have to squeeze more travellers onto the same number of trains. </p> <p>But there is a more important reason for the government having always been a bit wobbly when it comes to the environment. As Michael Jacobs, the director of the Fabian Society said in a pamphlet last year, New Labour associates environmentalism with ideas that it rejects, and believes that the majority of the public don't like them much either. </p> <p>\"As has now become familiar, New Labour identifies strongly - and wishes to be identified in the public mind - with ordinary families and their desires to get on in life. It sees environmentalism as at best an irrelevance to ordinary people, at worst as actively hostile to them. While middle England drives cars, enjoys shopping, wants material things and more foreign holidays, greens find consumption distasteful and their enthusiasm for curbing the car is symptomatic of their indifference to ordinary people's lives and opinions - something of which New Labour cannot be accused.\" </p> <p>All this might sound a bit harsh on the government. After all, it has introduced the climate change levy (albeit watered down after intensive lobbying from business), increased the fuel escalator to 6%, has introduced tax breaks for smaller and less polluting cars, and has announced a \u00a3180bn 10-year transport programme. But Jacobs is right. Deep down, the environment does not fit with the new Labour mindset. There is confusion between the sense that the environment is a big issue that over the long term cannot be ignored, and the short-term need to keep motorists, truckers and the Daily Mail off its back. That is why the transport white paper pulled its punches and proposed more road building. </p> <p>Labour's real problem, as was so blatantly obvious last week, is that it does not have a convincing story to tell. Extra billions in tax revenues have been rolling into the Treasury but the motorist and the road hauliers do not seem to have much to show for it. There has been a half-hearted attempt to show that dearer petrol means a better NHS, but absolutely nothing to suggest that it is part of a long-term strategy to make the environment an integral part of Labour's modernisation programme. </p> <p>This looks a long way off. Chris Hewett, of the Institute for Public Policy Research, said in the latest edition of New Economy that ministers are obsessed with raising labour productivity but pay for too little attention to the need for improved efficiency from natural resources. He believes the government sees \"a false trade-off between prudent use of natural resources and economic progress\". </p> <p>Far from being opposing forces, environmentalism and modernisation are two sides of the same coin. If we do not revolutionise industry to make it greener the future looks bleak. To harness new technologies to make cars lighter and use cleaner fuels - such as fuel cells - is not only environmentally sound but modern and progressive as well. </p> <p>There are signs that a revolution in the automotive industry is coming, with cars made of lightweight but ultrastrong fibres rather than metal. Far from wasting resources trying to defend the indefensible, the government should be looking at an industrial policy that would involve serious investment in sustainable technologies - set to be one of the big growth areas in the west as environmental concerns move up the agenda - and regulation policies that encourage car and energy companies to speed up the transition to leaner and greener production. </p> <p>Mr Hewett says that Britain's expertise in offshore engineering skills could be used to develop a manufacturing base in offshore wind technology, but failure to provide help to solar panel manufacturers means that energy companies are going to the continent instead. </p> <p>What are the chances of the government getting to grips with a serious environmental agenda that would see the greening of industry as an opportunity and not as a threat? About as much chance as there is of Whitehall cash for those campaigning to reopen the Wensleydale branch. Many of us nurture dreams of the day when we can change at Northallerton, potter up Wensleydale to Garsdale (the old Hawes Junction) before cruising down across Arten Gill and Dent Head on the Settle-Carlisle to Blea Moor tunnel and the Ribblehead viaduct. </p> <p>There's no harm in dreaming, because one day they may have to come true. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:larry.elliott@theguardian.com\">larry.elliott@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The IMF's latest World Economic Outlook to be released next week expects oil prices to continue to rise in coming months due to the approaching winter, low reserves and strong growth in the global economy. </p> <p>The IMF raised its forecast for global growth from 4.2% to 4.7% in 2000. It predicts 4.2% growth in 2001, according to the report cited in the German press. US GDP is expected to show a record growth of 5.2% this year, falling back to 3.2% in 2001. </p> <p>Euro zone growth is expected to be 3.5 % in 2000 and 3.4 % in 2001, while Germany will see 2.9 % growth this year and 3.3 % in 2001. </p> <p>The report said crude oil and heating oil reserves had not been filled to the usual extent during the summer because of high prices. This would increase pressure on existing reserves during the winter. In the short term, extra requirements would rise to 5m barrels of crude a day. OPEC said it had only agreed to produce 3m extra barrels a day. </p> <p>Even if crude prices were to stabilize at $32(\u00a322) a barrel, oil consuming nations would have to pay $140bn(\u00a3100bn) more for imported oil this year than in 1999. This would amount to 0.4 % of GDP of oil importing nations. </p> <p>\u0095 The euro is currently \"dangerously undervalued\", according to European Central Bank vice president Christian Noyer. In an interview to appear in today's edition of Les Echos, Noyer said: \"The European position is clear. The euro is dangerously undervalued.\" He believes that this view will be confirmed at next weekend's G7 meeting in Prague. </p> <p>Noyer said the euro's value \"does not correspond to economic fundamentals\" and that a \"brutal\" reversal could take place. </p> <p>\"The European economy does not need a weak euro, because it is competitive, even with the euro at a high level. A sustained weakness of the euro could lead companies to slow down their efforts on productivity and governments to hold back on their structural reforms.\"</p>",
  "<p>It is the most eagerly awaited album of the year from the \"best band in the world\". But a month before the first CD has made it into the shops the songs are already freely available on the internet. </p> <p>Kid A, the album on which Radiohead have been toiling since OK Computer became the epitome of 90s cool, can be downloaded on Napster, the controversial website which the music industry is trying to shut down. </p> <p>All but two of the tracks on the album, which is officially released in October, were available at the weekend on the site which the multinationals and some pop stars claim has robbed them of $2.5bn (\u00a31.7bn)in royalties. </p> <p>Sunset (Bird Of Prey), the new single from Fatboy Slim, also turned up on Napster last week, long before it was due to be released. And in the most surprising development of all, the Smashing Pumpkins released their latest album, Friends And Enemies Of Modern Music, on the internet free as a gesture to an industry \"poisoned with greed\". </p> <p>Despite the series of multi-million dollar piracy lawsuits hanging over it and its 19-year-old founder, Shawn Fanning, Napster, it seems, is thriving. </p> <p>Since the first cases were brought against it in the US courts in April by the rock band Metallica and Time Warner/AOL, traffic on the site has quadrupled, while its prosecutors have seen sales drop. </p> <p>Guardian critic Caroline Sullivan believes Metallica misjudged the mood of their fans. \"They looked greedy. Most fans see it in simplistic terms - that Metallica don't love them enough to share their music with them.\" </p> <p>Napster's democratic nature - fans automatically share all the MP3 music files on their computers when they log on - is the secret of its popularity, allowing it to build up a library of 20m tracks while providing a free platform for the music of up to 17,000 new bands in the past year. </p> <p>Even if Time Warner/AOL and the Recording Industry Association of America succeed in closing it, two other sites have sprung up. Gnutella, and Freenet do not need host databases, so they are less vulnerable to legal action. </p> <p>Not all musicians share the views of their paymasters. A spokesman for Radiohead said: \"The band are quite flattered. Obviously, you have to be concerned how they [the music] were obtained, but the fact that they have turned up on Napster so early shows there is huge interest. Radiohead do not think that music on the net is the threat that the industry seems to think it is. It has all got a little heavy.\" </p> <p>Fatboy Slim, real name Norman Cook, is even more relaxed. Napster's share-and-share-alike ethos fits perfectly with his left leaning politics. </p> <p>Damian Harris, the boss of Fatboy Slim's Brighton-based label, Skint Records, said: \"The amount of time companies spend stressing about getting a record on radio, you would think that the idea of some big global listening post would make perfect sense. I don't see why we can't all live in one big happy music sharing world.\" </p> <p>Public Enemy are also fervent proponents of what they call \"free music\". There was less idealism in the Smashing Pumpkins' decision to embrace Napster. Unhappy with how they see the industry sacrificing real content for \"bland, packaged\" Britney Spears-type pop, they put it in on the net as a dramatic gesture \"to a record label that didn't give us the support we deserved\". </p> <p>Shirley Manson, of Garbage is, with Metallica, Alanis Morissette, Elton John and Paul McCartney, among the most vocal of Napster's opponents. She said: \"It pisses me off that the entire world believes it's morally OK to rape musicians of their art and their livelihood. </p> <p>\"If it were Nike, do you think the establishment would sit back and allow it to happen?\"</p>",
  "You probably think the Olympic Games is a vastly important event for all of us Australians, a huge national rite that will \"put us on the map\" - the same map, presumably, on which the last Australian Olympics, in Melbourne in 1956, failed to inscribe us. Actually, despite our traditional obsession with sports, despite the coercive drumming of pre-Olympics hype, some of us don't care that much about the Olympics. We think we matter for other reasons. We suspect we're on the map already. <p>Australians tend to be natural pagans. Everything favours this: the delicious climate of the coasts; the dramatic and seductive landscapes of pounding surf and golden sand; the tanned bodies strutting; the food (some of the finest in the world); and the wines, which are superb. In such a setting, Australians have evolved a natural ethos as pleasure seekers in all areas of life. As the writer David Malouf points out, we don't even think of ourselves as hedonists, because that would be too self-conscious. Australian culture is for the most part deeply democratic, and joyously so as well. It is no longer \"provincial\", a distant and nervous response to norms generated in imperial centres. It is the result of a bloodless and slow-developing social revolution conducted over 40 years as a small society grew larger and immeasurably more complex, shook off its sense of derivative Englishness and its fear of American domination, and learned to trust its own talents. </p> <p>But a reasonable equipoise is with us only some of the time. Jingoism still disfigures the lowbrow end of our journalism. \"One of the ways in which we have matured is that we don't give a stuff about what other people think,\" blustered the columnist Susan Mitchell in the Australian, a national daily, last month. \"We no longer feel we have to explain ourselves to anyone but ourselves.\" </p> <p>This dismal, Serbian-style solipsism was actually meant as self-praise. But on some levels it is, alas, true. One sees it, for instance, in the bristling posture of denial that the Australian government recently took against UN criticism of its flouting of the human rights of aborigines. Australians still tend to be worried about what outsiders think, keep asking and then get furious if the answer is even fractionally less than flattering. </p> <p>Australia is often seen, especially in the US, as the last stand of the wild west, the place and ethos that were buried in America a century ago: a celluloid fiction, reinvented with kangaroos. In reality, Australians are among the most urbanised people on earth. They have seen their national animal, the kangaroo, only in a zoo or as roadkill on the highway. Nearly 90% of Australians live on the coast, not in the outback, wherever that elusive place may be. Our country towns are in decline. Their inhabitants keep moving to the coast. Because Australia has no fertile centre, there is no place for them in that immense, empty outback. </p> <p>So the \"typical Australian\" is not, as foreigners once thought, a bushman. He is a slightly worried guy with a tan, a bald spot, a mortgage, a mower and two kids, whose Australian dream is a double-front brick bungalow on a quarter-acre lot in the suburbs less than 30 minutes' drive from the nearest beach, with two other nice, two-kid, one-PC families on either side of him. </p> <p>And yet there are traits that do, indisputably, come down to modern Australia from the vanished days of the bush, and even from the convict era. They are wound tightly into our social history. One of these is the value set on \"mateship\". Essentially male bonding, mateship began in the harsh world of the penal settlement. It continued in the hardly less tough environment of labour that was the lot of most men in the bush: shearers, station hands and shepherds. To have a mate was to survive; to betray that mate was to be a scab, less than a man; such was the hard calculus of colonial life, and its traces are very much alive in Australia today. </p> <p>A less admirable trait is the Australian fetish of anti-elitism. If you want to nuke an enemy, call them an elitist, especially if they are an intellectual. The word is empty, since no society has ever been able to function without elites of skill, intelligence and ordinary competence. Yet Australians can rarely bring themselves to say they value human superiority. It sounds undemocratic. </p> <p>The one field of exception to this unseemly prejudice is sport, the real religion of down under. The idea of non-elitist sport is, of course, an absurdity. No Australian would waste their time watching a football match in which nobody was better than anyone else, or a horse race in which every nag plunked along at exactly the same speed. And, of course, Australians find no contradiction in that. Ours is the meritocracy that dare not speak its name. </p> <p>Some Australians will tell you they have a classless society. This is the merest fantasy. We began with the most ironbound of all class distinctions, between prisoners and the free. The freeborn (the \"sterling\") were bitterly opposed to giving up their social placement above the ex-convicts and their children (the \"currency\"). But the \"lower orders\" fiercely resented the pretensions of the nobs and were well aware that in a pioneer environment lady luck was a more powerful queen than Victoria Regina. Today's Australians may be more sophisticated than the 19th-century digger with his pockets full of gold dust, but at root the dot.com millionaires of the late 90s are not so different from their mining ancestors. The metaphor of all wealth production is gambling, and Australians are among the most shamefully obsessed gamblers in the world. We have 20 times as many \"pokies\" - poker machines - per person as the Americans. Our styles of wealth production enforce the belief that superiority is luck and only luck: no moral lessons apply. </p> <p>We are poor at symbolising ourselves. Many of us would like to snip the union jack off our flag, but no one can agree on a new design. Our official Olympic mascots and emblems are kitsch, climaxing last month in the Great Medal Screwup. It turned out that all the Olympic medals had been designed to feature not the Parthenon in Athens, not even the Temple of Zeus at Olympia, but the Colosseum in Rome, less noted for Olympic-style friendship than for gladiatorial butchery. What the hell, the officials of the Sydney organising committee of the Olympic Games apparently reasoned; it's still the ancient world, right? Then it befell some luckless Socog flunky to claim it wasn't meant to be the Colosseum, just a colosseum. Nice try, kid. It was too late to make new medals. </p> <p>Apart from the kangaroo, the koala and other enchanting marsupials, Australia seems short of identity icons. There is, of course, Ayers Rock, the most sublime stone on earth. There is also the incomparable Great Barrier Reef, a single coral organism some 1,250 miles long. We have two famous structures, both in Sydney: the harbour bridge and the opera house, the latter a masterpiece by the Danish architect Jorn Utzon. Perched on one of the world's most beautiful sites, a headland in Sydney Harbour, and surrounded on three sides by sapphire water, this great building was never seen in completion by its architect. He resigned under stress and never came back to Sydney, so that the promise of those lovely tiled arcs and shells is not fulfilled by the interior, awkwardly finished by a local designer. </p> <p>Where it counts - which is more in production than interpretation - Australia has a vigorous cultural life. The list of first-rank Australian novelists, headed up by Murray Bail, Peter Carey and David Malouf - writers of exceptional power and social insight - is a considerable one. It has also produced a brilliant biographer and diagnostician of past culture in Peter Conrad, an erudite and dark-minded expatriate from Tasmania. Books, of course, circulate everywhere, whereas paintings and buildings do not. Consequently major architects such as Glenn Murcutt and Philip Cox are little known outside Australia. This is a pity, and even worse is the general ignorance of Australian contemporary painting. It is bizarre that artists as excellent as John Olsen, Colin Lanceley, Tim Storrier and Mike Parr aren't the world figures they deserve to be. The only Australian art that attracts much overseas attention is contemporary aboriginal art, which varies enormously in quality. </p> <p>The clarity of Australian cultural achievement is often muddied by our most irksome cultural shortcoming: a peevishly insecure hatred of \"tall poppies\", people distinguished by their achievements in any area. Australia has never honoured its artists, intellectuals, writers and musicians as fully as its sports figures; there is always an undertow of resentment, of the lowbrows' residual suspicion that the highbrow is conning them. Everyone bitches about this; nobody does anything about it. It is hardwired into us, a proof of \"toughness\". </p> <p>Under valued culturally, Australia is also politically obscure. Why? Because we're so well behaved. We are not the mouse that roared. Historically, we have rarely even contemplated roaring. As the former prime minister Paul Keating has pointed out, Australia has always been short of the defining value systems that are gained through conflict. We have never had a civil war or a revolution. We have never been invaded - though we nearly were during the second world war, by the Japanese. Nobody has ever called us a Great Satan or even a little one. We tend to like Americans more than most nations do, although we do not have the least desire to be like them. </p> <p>Historically, Australia felt little resentment about its colonial control by Britain and its sovereign. Its population was heavy with Irishmen and Irishwomen, but the resentments their ancestors had brought with them soon mellowed into ineffectuality in the antipodean sun. As a colony we were content to fulfil our destiny, which was to supply Britain with cheap wheat, wool and (when required) cannon fodder for wars against the Boers or the Huns. </p> <p>In these, we had little or no stake of our own. Britain, with grim enthusiasm, condemned us to assist in the creation of dead colonial heroes. In the first world war, Australia lost 59,258 young men out of a total of 330,000 sent abroad. Both as a proportion of troops killed or missing and as a proportion of the national population, this was the highest figure for any allied state. </p> <p>It left us in the 20s as a psychologically devastated nation of widows, spinsters and orphans. This enormous death toll was rationalised as a cleansing, an erasure of the inherited stain of the convict era. Winston Churchill, who sent our grandfathers to die on the implacable slopes of Gallipoli, was by no means the only Englishman to think they came from \"tainted\" stock. </p> <p>Australia still had a largely colonial mentality when I was born, in 1938. Only vestiges of it survive today. The most important of these relics is, of course, its monarchy. It is a bizarre fact that no Australian can be the country's head of state. That role is reserved for the king or queen of England, by definition a foreigner, and not even an elected one: the office of the Australian head of state remains purely hereditary, open only to a small clan of Anglo-German squillionaires known as the Windsors. This narrows the field of talent. </p> <p>According to the Australian constitution - a document written for us by the British at the turn of the century - it is ultimately the British monarch who rules Australia through an unelected viceroy, the governor-general. This official may be Australian or may not. They may, on behalf of the King or Queen, cancel any law enacted by the Australian government or even throw out the government and call for new elections. Or they may not. In practice they almost never do. The last and only time they did was in 1975, when the governor-general, Sir John Kerr, fired the Labor government led by Gough Whitlam. </p> <p>This caused shock and resentment. Millions of Australians felt that Whitlam, their hero, the great reformer of government policy in the domains of race, immigration, foreign policy and the arts, had been stolen from them. There are still plenty of people around who regard this as not far from a coup d'\u00e9tat. </p> <p>The firing of Whitlam made many Australians sit up with a jerk. It had never occurred to them before that the Queen had the raw constitutional power to do such a thing. It cranked up the long-dormant impulse toward republicanism. Until the 70s this had been an issue only for intellectuals and a few leftwing workers whose vehemence earned them an undeserved reputation as ratbags (obsessed eccentrics). The problem was democratising the republican issue while detaching it from the ownership of the Australian left. And it did slowly broaden, though its main political instrument, the Australian Republican Movement (ARM), didn't come into existence until the 80s. </p> <p>The growth of republican feeling in Australia coincided with, and was strongly encouraged by, the prime ministership (1991-96) of Keating, a brilliant and abrasive Laborite much feared for his insults (\"pansies\" and \"unrepresentative swill\" were among the milder epithets he launched at his foes in parliamentary debate) and greatly misunderstood for his tastes: given his passions for antique French clocks and Georgian furniture, Keating was the most cultivated Australian ever to serve as prime minister. The ARM's chief unelected backer was a formidable young merchant banker named Malcolm Turnbull. (Full disclosure obliges me to say that Turnbull is married to my niece Lucy, herself the deputy lord mayor of Sydney.) Despite Keating's defeat in the 1996 elections, Turnbull and his fellow republicans were able to bring the republic issue to a nationwide vote last year. </p> <p> The result was a triumph of electoral timidity, worsened by fake populism. By a queer flip-flop of logic, a majority of Australian voters (55% to 45%) decided that to have an Australian president appointed by a democratically-elected government was elitist and unsafe, whereas to have an immensely rich hereditary monarch as their head of state was somehow democratic. </p> <p>The monarchists won the referendum, not because Australians were devoted to the Queen and her successors but because feuding republicans couldn't agree on which model of republic to uphold. Should the new-style head of state, an Australian president, be appointed by parliament? Or should they be elected in a national campaign, in the American manner? The ARM wanted the former, but Australians hated the idea of an American-style republic - or American-style anything - in their public life. This split the republican vote, to the boundless relief of the monarchists, who could never have carried the issue on their own. </p> <p>Soon after the referendum, the Queen and her cold fish of a consort, Prince Philip, toured Australia. The crowds were small and more curious than enthusiastic; the media polite but indifferent. The romantic, near-mystical queen worship that had surrounded her tour in 1954 was gone forever. Being smarter than the monarchists, the Queen could easily read the signs. She openly acknowledged the possibility of a stable republic in Australia. </p> <p>The current prime minister, John Howard, is an obdurate monarchist. But the next in line as head of his conservative Liberal party, Peter Costello, is a republican. The Australian Labor party is republican through and through. It is only a matter of time before the less reactionary and nostalgic Liberal politicians come out of the closet, and then the monarchy in Australia will be finished. </p> <p>It is hard to say why, apart from habit, there should be any nostalgia for royal forms among Australians, especially when we are so fond of our national anti-elitism. But people, including Australians, want figures to admire. \"If we don't have the Queen, whom can we look up to?\" was one of the frequent complaints at referendum time. The thought that in a democracy you don't look up to your superiors, but sideways at your fellow citizens, wasn't much aired in monarchist circles. And Australia has always been short not only of convincing shared ceremonies of national identity but also of shared folk heroes. You can count them on the fingers of two hands. Two are alive - the great cricketer Sir Donald Bradman, now 91, and the swimming champion Dawn Fraser. The veterans of Gallipoli, a few of whom still live, are invested with a collective heroism. The other heroes are dead. They include a racehorse, Phar Lap; and a criminal, the bushranger, Irish nationalist and proto-republican Ned Kelly, hanged for theft and murder in Melbourne in 1880. </p> <p>Another reason why some Australians want to keep the monarchy is unease about mixture. The Queen evokes the loyalty and gratitude of the \"pure\" Anglo-Australian because she personifies \"pure\" Britain. This worked fine half a century ago, when more than 90% of Australians were still of British descent and could feel themselves to be, as the then prime minister Robert Menzies would later put it, \"British to the boot heels\". But today the picture of exclusionary Australia, the continent-size British island just below Asia, has almost faded away. The white Australia policy, that disgraceful provision whereby no one of Asian or black descent could settle in Australia, was abandoned in the 60s, never to be revived. Whole suburbs, such as Cabramatta in western Sydney, have become south-east Asian enclaves. Though Australia admits only some 85,000 legal immigrants a year, the Asian component is very visible and it excites xenophobia. The role of the Queen as head of state has a calming effect, suggesting that the \"old\" Anglo-Australia is still notionally within reach. </p> <p>Compared with their older selves, Australians - especially the younger ones - are a tolerant people. We are one of the world's most successful multicultural democracies, and this is a triumph of no small consequence. Australians on the whole realise that multiculturalism, that forbiddingly bureaucratic polysyllable responsible for so much hot air, really means learning to read other people's image banks, not a forced renunciation of one's own. They realise, quite naturally, that the desire to \"give people a fair go\", which is one of the traditional moral imperatives of Australian life, also applies to immigrants. </p> <p> This does not, however, mean that Australia's road to multi-culturalism has been stoneless. Translated into government policy, multi-culturalism in the 80s became, its critics say, not just a neutral recognition of diversity but a pork barrel for buying the temporary loyalties of ethnic groups. </p> <p>Maybe, but it doesn't ultimately matter. Immigration has done its work. It has changed Australia irrevocably. Nobody old enough to remember the dullness of its old monocultural cuisine can regret that. The British empire has gone. The Commonwealth is no longer, to put it mildly, a decisive linkage between nations. The Australia Act of 1986 formally defined Britain as a foreign country. Australia's economic links to Britain, though not insignificant, are small and dwindling in comparison with its trading ties to the near north, once known as the far east. </p> <p>Britain is in the EU and will act in accordance with its interests there, giving no priority to Australia. Australians who feel they are British because they speak English are fooling themselves but no one else. You can no longer \"be\" Australian and, without conflict, \"feel\" British. The two nations are too far apart. </p> <p>\u0095 A longer version of this article appears in this week's Time magazine.

  "Polly Toynbee (OK, keep on trucking, September 14) asks why the Green party wasn't on the streets protesting against the lorry drivers seeking cheap fuel. Some of us were doing what we were elected for: pressing the European parliament to take on board climate change. <p>In the same summer that scientists found water at the North Pole where for 50m years there's been ice, I was steering a report through the European parliament arguing for the introduction of environmental charges and taxes on the aviation industry to encourage airlines to reduce the CO2 emissions. The report was agreed by the parliament by an overwhelming majority on the day the fuel protests started. Why wasn't the Guardian telling its readers about this sensible step forward? </p> <p>The Greens are pressing the government not to back down in the face of the misguided fuel protests. The royal commission on environmental pollution is proposing that the UK reduces its greenhouse gas emissions by 60%. Now is the time for the government to take the lead in showing how neither air passengers nor road hauliers and private motorists pay their way since the tax take from transport does not cover all the resulting costs of roads, accidents, damage to buildings, chronic respiratory illnesses and climate change causing flooding and changes to agriculture. <br><b>Caroline Lucas MEP</b><br> Green party </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>\u0095 Liberal Democrats believe that the government must be more open about the money it receives from fuel and how it is spent. Taxes on fuel should not be a back-door way of raising revenue - they should be used to reform the tax system to protect the environment. Because revenues raised have not been returned to the travelling public, we have voted against increases in fuel duty by both Labour and the last Conservative government. We also believe that oil companies should not be allowed to exploit those reliant on personal transport in rural areas. </p> <p>We call on the government to: place a cap on fuel taxes (in real terms) for five years so that the government does not profit from future increases in fuel prices; use the VAT windfall that it has received from the higher than expected fuel prices to ease the burden on the travelling public (it should not be used to boost the chancellor's pre-election war chest); ensure that oil companies recognise their social responsibilities, both in respect of pricing and security of supply (if they fail to do so, we will take measures to tax their excess profits); and support people in rural communities who rely on fuel through rate relief on rural fuel stations and increased investment in community public transport. <br><b>Matthew Taylor MP <br>Don Foster MP <br>Dr Vince Cable MP<br>Charles Kennedy MP</b></p> <p>\u0095 I agree with William Hague, that we must have fair taxation of fuel if UK road hauliers are to compete with their European counterparts. The commonsense way to do this would be through a unified taxation policy throughout the EU devised to take account of environmental issues. The problem is that Hague doesn't support the EU and he has abandoned the former Conservative government's environmental policy!<br><b>David Woods</b><br> Lichfield, Staffordshire </p> <p> </p> <p>\u0095 I'd like to propose a personal vote of thanks to those who blockaded the refineries last week.

  "John Prescott has barred Mike O'Brien, the Home Office minister in charge of freedom of information, from access to the financial details of a deal to build Britain's first private toll motorway. <p>Mr O'Brien is still at loggerheads with Mr Prescott over the \u00a3750m Birmingham northern relief road, following the deputy prime minister's u-turn on Labour's election pledge to cancel the scheme. </p> <p>The road runs through Mr O'Brien's North Warwick constituency, and he was one of four Labour MPs who backed protesters taking the government to court to reveal details about the deal. The protesters won a ruling giving Mr Prescott discretion to release commercial figures related to the controversial scheme. </p> <p>However, Mr Prescott has refused to release any financial information, to protect the consortium planning the development. He cited \"commercial secrecy\" - one of the main planks for withholding documents under the freedom of information bill promoted by Mr O'Brien - as the reason for not handing it over. </p> <p>\"No doubt Mr Prescott has had to act on the best legal advice of his civil servants,\" Mr O'Brien said. </p> <p>The MP and the protesters wanted details of the tolls for drivers, and of the huge compensation bill Mr Prescott would face if the government ever cancelled the scheme. </p> <p>After Tony Wright, Labour MP for Cannock Chase, tabled a parliamentary question, protesters also found that almost \u00a320m was to be spent on widening the M42 connecting road to help traffic use the private motorway. At that time MPs had been told that construction of the private road would cost taxpayers nothing, and details of the widening scheme had been withheld from the public inquiry into the scheme. </p> <p>The deal had been signed by the Tories under Lord Parkinson when he was transport secretary, and included confidentiality clauses. </p> <p>Before Labour was elected, Frank Dobson, then environment spokesman, pledged that Labour would not build the road. Mr O'Brien was also quoted in a Labour press release as saying: \"The road is environmentally damaging and unnecessary. It will not cure congestion on the M6.\" </p> <p>Labour is also committed to all private road deals agreed by the government being open to public scrutiny - but the deal was signed by the Conservatives in 1994, and, says the party, the rule cannot be retrospective. </p> <p>Yesterday, Mr O'Brien said he still opposed the building of the road even though it was government policy. \"Mr Prescott has got his views on the road, I have got mine and I have not changed mine. I still oppose the road.\" He blamed the Tories for signing the confidential deal. </p> <p>This has not impressed protesters. Gerald Kells, of Friends of the Earth, said: \"Mr Prescott has used as little open government as he can get away with and left the public completely in the dark.\" </p> <p>Mr Prescott's official statement says: \"The secretary of state has decided to withhold all those parts of the agreement which fall within the discretionary exemption on commercial confidentiality. In his view to disclose these provisions would harm Midland Expressway Ltd's (the consortium of banks and builders) commercial interests, and would not substantively add to anyone's understanding of the possible environmental impacts of the proposed road.\"</p>",
  "<p>British Telecom and its American counterpart AT&amp;T, are contemplating a radical transatlantic plan to break up the two telecommunication groups and reconstitute themselves as two focused global businesses, covering mobile telecoms and international business services. </p> <p>At the same time, two \"rump\" businesses, covering traditional domestic fixed line telecoms, including the domestic phone network, would be created in Britain and the US. Such a move amounts to one of the most ambitious pieces of corporate alchemy ever seen. AT&amp;T is valued at about $120bn (\u00a386bn). Its mobile business alone is reckoned to be worth $70bn. Despite BT's sliding share price, the company is worth \u00a352bn. </p> <p>But sources warned that the plan was still in \"skeletal\" form and was just one of a wide range of options being examined as BT and AT&amp;T try to reposition themselves. </p> <p>AT&amp;T chairman Michael Armstrong and his counterparts at BT, chairman Sir Iain Vallance and chief executive Sir Peter Bonfield, have developed deep business ties and the two groups have transatlantic alliances covering mobile and international business service units, respectively named Advance and Concert. The idea of solidifying these two existing alliances into separate entities, each of which could be floated in its own right, has been toyed with for months. Both managements are under intense pressure from Wall Street and the City to unlock shareholder value and at the same time shed their reputations as introverted former monopolies. </p> <p>John Malone, an AT&amp;T board member and largest individual shareholder through his vehicle Liberty Media, has long been agitating for a split-up of the US company. He argues for splitting off the wireless group entirely - making it easier for Wall Street to value the rest of the company's assets, while underscoring their trading discounts. </p> <p>But the practical obstacles to what would amount to a simultaneous merger and multiple demerger of BT and AT&amp;T are daunting. Potential trip-wires would include the allocation of senior management posts among the two in ternational and two domestic businesses formed, decisions on domicile - whether British or American - and also the attitude of regulators in Washington, Brussels and London. </p> <p>Analysts point out that a deal would take many months, or even years, to implement, and would result in upheaval for 250,000 global staff. </p> <p>There is this idea that the company is just sitting on its hands, one banker close to BT noted but, like AT&amp;T, whose stock price has halved this year, BT executives, having watched the company under-perform by a similar margin, feel increasing frustration at the market's refusal to acknowledge the amount of restructuring already under way.</p>",

  "<p>Anita Roddick, founder of the Body Shop, yesterday said she planned to step down from the high-street chain. </p> <p>The launch of her book, Business As Unusual, today marked the end of an era, she said. She needed \"breathing space\" and \"the political freedom to do other things after 25 years in commerce\". </p> <p>\"I'm not sure how much longer I'm going to hang around... I don't want to keep on emoting about the shape of a bottle or whether or not we should go for elderberry body butter,\" she said in a Sunday newspaper interview. </p> <p>Her ambitions , she added, were to \"smash the World Trade Organisation, blow up the armaments industry, do some real populist campaigning that moves politicians to concentrate on something other than their own careers\". </p> <p>She said she would stay on at Body Shop as co-chairman with her husband Gordon \"for at least two years\". The two of them started the Body Shop business, with a first store in Brighton. The have since built up a global chain of 1,754 shops which now has a market value of \u00a3220m. </p> <p>The company was floated on the London stock market in 1984. Profit became the driving force: \"Everything became about how much we were worth,\" she said sadly. </p> <p>Her position has been the subject of City speculation since Patrick Gournay, former boss at Danone of France, became chief executive in May 1998. The following year profits had slumped to \u00a33.4m but in March the company reported a bounceback with a pre-tax profit of \u00a328.8m </p> <p>A Body Shop spokesman said last night there was no question of Ms Roddick quitting immediately. \"She is still very much a part of the business, but is increasingly doing things of her own.\"</p>",
  "<p>The soothsayers were back in business last week, this time casting their prophetic eyes over the future of our employment. Tomorrow's Work, the latest report into the future of the world of business, paints a picture of six-hour days, double pay and all the flexibility that an employee's heart desires. </p> <p>Following a survey of 1,500 workers and 150 companies, the report is confident in its predictions. Author Graeme Leach, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, boldly claims that, by 2020, the nine-to-five rat race will be extinct and present levels of self-employment, commuting and technology use, as well as age and sex gaps, will have changed beyond recognition. </p> <p>\"The labour market in 2000 is far more traditional than perceived,\" says Leach. \"It is not dominated by part-time employment, flexible working, home-working, teleworking or portfolio workers. But by 2010, I think that's all going to be different. There's going to be huge sea-change in the labour market.\" He anticipates that, in 20 years' time, 20-25% of the workforce will be temporary workers and many more will be flexible, that 25% of people will no longer work in a traditional office and that 50% will work from home in some form. </p> <p>There remains, however, a temptation to mumble that we have heard it all before. The future of work and the benefits for workers have been championed frequently in the past, but to no avail. We all continue to trek to our offices on a daily basis because, as much as we moan about it, we know that working in-house is the most effective way of getting things done. Leach is all too aware of this scepticism, arguing that that is why his report forecasts the real changes to happen 20 years from now. </p> <p>\"What our survey showed was that around 20% of organisations think there's going to be massive organisational change within the next decade, and 60% think it's going to be significant. If they are already preparing for that, the changes won't be far behind.\" </p> <p>It is a position shared by Jeremy Myerson, director of the Helen Hamlyn Research Centre. \"Nobody knows what it's going to be like exactly, but there are various things that we can predict,\" he says. \"For example, the demographics of the workplace are going to change. By 2020, more than 50% of Europe's adult population will be over 50, and there will be a relative shortage of young workers, so employers will have to have more age-friendly policies.\" </p> <p>He goes on to forecast a more feminised workplace, spread over a range of locations with miniaturised, fully portable technology. \"The current divisions at the moment between stuff you have on a hard screen, and stuff you carry around on paper will go. Instead there'll be display technology which involves electronic screens with all the character istics of paper. This is not over the horizon - this is all very close. This will all be current by 2020.\" </p> <p>Of course, no prognosis is complete without its doubters and Clare Lees, associate director of the Henley Centre, which forecasts work trends, is just one of these. \"The paperless office will never happen,\" she says. \"Not until we start changing habits in schools, where kids grow up writing and reading books, will we start changing our attitude to paper.\" Likewise, she is not convinced by the home-working habit. \"Right now, only 1% of the working population are formally contracted home-workers - it's hardly the mass market.\" </p> <p>Lees highlights instead the \"homing at work\" trend, where lengthening working hours encourage people to do home-shopping and internet surfing at the office. \"In some companies, that's been actively encouraged, because if they're expecting people to work long hours it's a bit of a trade-off,\" says Lees. \"Giving people that flexibility is kind of a treat, but since more than 52% of working adults say they do some kind of homing at work, it's reasonable to say that if you didn't offer that, people would just walk.\" </p> <p>One of the business benefits of flexible working, of course, is that the costs of equipment, phone calls and computer use are all lessened by the presence of fewer full-timers in the office. It's a trade-off Barbara Narkiewicz is willing to accept, having gained more from her job since she started her flexible three-day week contract with Kelly Services recruitment company. \"Hooked to my ISDN line at home, I can be very productive over a short space of time,\" she says. \"I don't get distracted and I don't have to commute every day.\" Her decision to work from home was taken because she felt she wanted more leisure time for other things: \"I just wanted to fulfil other ambitions that weren't work related.\" </p> <p>In line with Leach's report, Narkiewicz is convinced that a growing appreciation of leisure time will see more workers following her initiative: \"I feel a lot of people want to do a similar thing. More and more people will start to work like this.\" </p> <p>Lucy Cox, an office manager and receptionist with GCI Jane Howard, has been job-sharing for a year. As a single mother, the appeal of shorter working hours is that they allow her to spend more time with her son. \"A lot of mothers I know are in a similar position. They don't want to be stuck in a domestic situation. They want to mix with adults and bring some money home, but they don't want to feel that they're constantly fighting a battle to meet their children at the correct time. I can see it happening more and more.\" </p> <p>Her desire to \"mix with adults\" is one that will ensure the office situation will survive in whatever form. Home-working can be a lonely business and one which not everyone would voluntarily embrace. As Leach himself admits: \"There's a fear of being outside the loop, of being seen as not working. It's very difficult to imagine those pressures will disappear. Assuming they continue, then so will the office environment.\" </p> <p>\"There will always be workplaces,\" says Myerson, \"because you need a sort of intense interactive experience.\" Leach agrees that \"the reason you'll go to an office in the future is not to process information or to do private considerative work, but to meet other people. The office of the future will be much more of a social landscape.\" Even dissenter Lees is ready to concede that we could end up in \"the ridiculous situation where you're doing all your work at home but having to go into work to socialise.\" </p> <p>Leach is keen to stress that flexible working doesn't necessarily mean working from home. \"Work will be done anywhere the laptop can be plugged in or connected to the office. We are still saying that the overwhelming majority of employees will work in an office environment but it will change. The key thing is that it will be a change the workforce generally feels positive about, as opposed to it being forced on us, and taken as the price of globalisation and economic competition.\" </p> <p>Cox is testament to that positivity and has no fears for what the future holds. \"I think with what I do - running an office - even if people do work more from home or on the mobile, you've still got offices that need to be staffed. There's still a job there. It's definitely not the end to work as we know it.\"</p>",
  "She talks as she lives, without pause for breath. She exists IN CAPITAL LETTERS, with emphasis , high on aphorisms and Inspirational Quotations. \"I do take the moral high ground. I take it because I prefer kindness over rapacity, public good over private greed. I don't give a toss. If you don't like someone because they're espousing a better way... fuck it, life's too short.\" <p>Mockable, inexorable Anita Roddick. Queen of Peppermint Foot Lotion, with her do-goody slogans, her till-side petitions, her estimated fortune (shared with husband Gordon) of \u00a340m. The batty alma mater of the Body Shop behemoth, with more business than sense; the anti-entrepreneur who put principles before profit, didn't test on animals, recycled, traded fair, battled in Seattle. </p> <p>The Artemis of green consumerism has now given up day-to-day running of the business she and Gordon set up 24 years ago in her home town of Littlehampton. Following an effortless trajectory in the eco-hungry 80s, the Body Shop stuttered under the demands of global expansion, sustaining heavy losses in the US and failing to adapt to the changing face of the beauty market. As the formula lost its freshness, so the Roddicks' familial approach lacked the tight professionalism demanded by a multinational. </p> <p>\"So you brought in new people, people who were strangers, then you had to let go. And that letting go was much easier than the media thought it would be. I don't do anything I don't want to do,\" she adds, believably. </p> <p>Roddick's exhausting, exhaustive autobiography, Business as Unusual, published today, charts the company's uneasy transition in counterpoint to her own evolution. In print and in person, she refers to the Body Shop's corporate centre with indulgence and incomprehension: \"The Board\" is at once petulant toddler and piranha. </p> <p>One chapter recounts an archetypal stand-off when the Gulf War broke out. Roddick put together an instant anti-war campaign, posting billboards and setting up petitions in every shop. A week later, the board voted to drop it, deeming it too political and bad for the company's image. </p> <p>Undaunted, Roddick insisted on involving everyone in head office; the company closed for a day. \"I'll never know what would have happened had the debate turned against me. I was saved by a couple of members of staff who had been to the Falklands and served in Northern Ireland. They explained what war was like, that war is never meant to save democracy, and I didn't have to say anything.\" </p> <p>The joy in the past, she says, was when you didn't have to explain: \"You instinctively knew it was a good idea and you had the resources to back it up. Now there's presentations, there's conflict, there's less bravery. That's not bad, it's probably how you survive, but it's less interesting for me. The minute you put an anti-ageing cream out, I'm out the door, the minute you stand for nothing, but they're not that...\" She decides against \"stupid\". \"They understand that this company was built on more than products.\" </p> <p>Her gaze is even but her hands and feet are frantic: shoes off, shoes on, shoe lost under the chair; palm cupping, now a fist, now fingers spidering across the table. Roddick is small but everything about her feels big: the copper wire hair, the mouth etched with a particular set of lines from pursing in polemic. Her energy is abundant and heedless of boundary. She is the kind of woman who leaves the toilet door open so she can continue a conversation. The passion is personal, activism is everyday. </p> <p>\"You do become more radical as you get older. Men become more familial or collegiate, they play golf. [Golf is clearly the nadir of pointless activity.] But women have an amazing way of reinventing themselves.\" </p> <p>She continues to devote most of her time to Body Shop business, she says, doing \"the belly to belly stuff\", going on delivery runs at 5am, visiting the company's community trade initiatives and working on a slew of projects from Easterhouse to Ogoniland. She is also developing a range called Wise Women \"because nobody is dealing with products for my age group [she is 57]. Our face is looking after itself but our body is one sack of dead skin. They need products that make you feel less dry, a million more products for the feet. I listen to 80-year-olds and what offends them? Feet! It's an ignored area.\" </p> <p>Does she balk at being synonymous with Peppermint Foot Lotion? \"I bloody love it. I'd be depressed if it was a bloody bubble bath, there's nothing of value in that, but the lotion and the community trade project, I'm a happy bunny with that one.\" </p> <p>The campaign fest could grate. Is it real? Is it naive? Is it embarrassing? \"It's been a consistent pattern,\" she points out. \"Take the money and turn it into something beyond profit for shareholders, shape a company's dynamics and the consciousness of people you employ. I'm too intelligent to think people I employ go home dreaming about moisture cream.\" </p> <p>But what about those who simply work to support themselves? \"Absolutely, that's 90% of what we have and you can't fire them for being boring, you can't fire someone if they're not political. What you do is say you will have the best working conditions, sabbatical time, a child development centre, a love programme that allows you to train for anything you want, but don't mess around with the values.\" </p> <p> Born in a bomb shelter in 1942, Roddick was the product of an improbably romantic union between her mother and her father's cousin. Her nominal father died when Anita was 10, still believing her his daughter, and cousin Henry moved in. She delights in the tale. \"The duplicity was incredible: the only Italians in town and she was conducting an affair with her husband's cousin! I loved that.\" </p> <p>Her mother taught her to be uncynical about love and that love and work were seamless. As a child, she learnt the lot of the poor and the outsider. But she traces her sense of outrage to a specific. \"It's a kick-start from the day I knew my dad died. The same week I picked up this book on the Holocaust. It was the first time photographs of the concentration camps came out in paperback. I really do connect that outrage with loss.\" </p> <p>Do public events upset her more than private ones? \"It's not about what affects you most, it's about what you can do to solve the problem. What you can do,\" she stresses. \"When it becomes abysmal is when you have a sense of outrage and you do nothing. I take this stuff so bloody personally.\" </p> <p>I ask her to place some self-descriptives in order of importance. (\"Couldn't we have some better words? What about community organiser?\") She puts activist first, businesswoman last, partner and mother second equal. And gladly acquiesces to the suggestion that her daughters, Justine and Sam, now mothers themselves, were at times secondary to her work. \"If they were unhappy, if they were ill, everything dropped. If they were just being boring little kids, I was doing my life. They were never the pivot of my horizon and I never wanted to be theirs.\" </p> <p>As for Gordon, her husband and partner for over three decades, famously the provider of \"sympathetic sperm\" for a broody Roddick, whom she later \"learned to fall in love with\": \"It's been an amazing journey and it hasn't finished yet. What we've now got to work out is the pattern of life outside the company, how will we mould our interests into things that are really productive, what moral and political influence can we have.\" </p> <p>It all sounds rather draining. Is Gordon as obsessive? \"Probably not. He's much more behind the scenes. He has leisure, which I don't have. He plays golf, he balances his life better. But I don't want to be in his shadow. </p> <p>\"All my real passions, that's what gives me the joy. Like the journey I took last week with Leonard, this old Korean vet, sitting in the middle of the desert and he's been painting this mountain for 10 years. He's got quotes in the picture, he's got 'God is love'. I love the obsession, that notion of continuity. He's been there for years, doing the same thing, staying focused.\" </p> <p>And what about the cynics who might venture that a decade is just too long to spend on one painting, that perhaps Leonard might benefit from psychiatric intervention, or that he might make a more beneficial contribution to society if he drove back into town and got a job? </p> <p>\"Up your bum.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Business As Unusual is published today by Thorsons at \u00a317.99.

  "<p>Rangers, supposedly the untouchables, needed these points after skittish behaviour in the Premier League. Last Wednesday the Ibrox machine crushed Sturm Graz in the Champions League, but domestically Rangers have lurched like an old tractor. This was their first league win in three attempts. </p> <p>Only now are the stakes truly becoming high for Dick Advocaat's side. On Wednesday they travel to Monaco in their second Champions League match, a night which will measure their mettle in the bigger environment. Advocaat will already be plotting. </p> <p>Poor Antti Niemi, the brave and agile Hearts goalkeeper, must wonder what he could have done to keep them out. He made a series of blocks and catches only to see Rangers score from a rebound after yet another fine save. It did not require someone of Ronald de Boer's calibre to score from five yards. </p> <p>One had some sympathy for Hearts. They turned up at Ibrox with all the eagerness of errant schoolboys arriving for the cane. Having pulled off late-night heroics in Germany on Thursday, holding Stuttgart to 1-0 in the Uefa Cup, the Edinburgh club, claiming exhaustion, had requested the postponement of this match. Rangers haughtily said no. </p> <p>The Hearts manager Jim Jefferies has received a few skelpings in this arena. Three years ago, in a farcical match, he watched as three of his players were red-carded. On at least two other occasions he has seen a point or points stolen in the dying seconds. He did not need this latest row to know that Ibrox is the cruellest place. </p> <p>Even worse, the Hearts coffers seem to be perennially empty. When Jefferies won the Scottish Cup by beating Rangers in one of the Scottish game's great post-war achievements in 1998 he had needed at least one or two financial injections. This season all we've heard from Tynecastle, supposedly the home of one of Scotland's big clubs, is that monthly losses are killing the club. </p> <p>In a typically gutsy performance, Hearts were made to rue their missed chances. In their first attack Gary McSwegan headed tamely at Stefan Klos, then Juanjo, their precocious Spanish youngster, dribbled this way and that past a posse of Rangers defenders before meekly allowing Klos to save again. </p> <p>De Boer sealed it for Rangers in the 58th minute, prodding home the rebound after Billy Dodds' shot. Rangers savoured this test but real scrutiny awaits in three days' time.</p>"
