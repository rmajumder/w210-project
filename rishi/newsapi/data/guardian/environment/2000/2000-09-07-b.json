  "Britain's first privately run state school opened yesterday, with more than 100 computers, a cyber cafe, and a swipe card system instead of a morning register. <p>Kings College in Guildford, based on the site of the Kings Manor school closed down by Surrey county council after a series of poor Ofsted reports, welcomed 140 students from year seven and year 12. The remainder of the 400 school population will start today. </p> <p>Information technology will be taught throughout the curriculum and pupils are being encouraged to send and receive homework via email. </p> <p>The lunch break has been abandoned in favour of two half-hour \"brunch-breaks\". </p> <p>Staff gave a presentation with overhead projector and a motivating pep talk. Each pupil has signed a contract pledging to abide by school rules. It has a strict policy on exclusions. </p> <p>David Crossley, the principal, said: \"We want our pupils to be autonomous learners but we will absolutely not be a soft touch. </p> <p>\"We have constructed a modern working environment, not a factory, and we want to convince every single pupil that they can achieve.\" </p> <p>A-levels have been replaced by the international baccalaureate in the sixth form. A private company, 3E's Enterprises, a subsidiary of the City Technology College in Kingshurst, Birmingham, is running the school. </p> <p>Yesterday new figures showed 86% of primary schools and 98% of secondary schools are connected to the internet. This year 4,400 more primary schools have gone on-line. </p> <p>\"We are well on track to meet our pledge to connect every school to the internet by 2002,\" said Michael Wills, minister for technology and learning. </p> <p>The government will this month launch a drive to encourage parents who want to support their children's learning on computer.</p>",

  "<h2>Ithaka by Adele Geras (David Fickling Books, \u00a312.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335504225\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2005/10/20/ithaka_final.jpg\" alt=\"Ithaka by Adele Geras\" width=\"128\" height=\"195\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=0385603916\">Buy Ithaka at the Guardian bookshop</a></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  This is the story of the women who wait for Odysseus to return from Troy. Of the many versions of Homer's epic, this is the first - with apologies to James Joyce - to do justice to the women in the story. It's a home, rather than a homecoming, narrative. Touching and engaging. <p> <br></p> <h2>The Rainbow Opera by Elizabeth Knox (Faber)</h2> <p>First of two books about a world in which some people are able to control dreams. A political candidate pays a corrupt dreamcatcher to give people dreams promoting his candidacy. Cousins Laura (a dreamcatcher) and Rose (who doesn't have a skill) embark on a journey to discover that not all is well with the way dreams are being used.</p> <h2>The Moth Diaries by Rachel Klein (Faber, \u00a39.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335504226\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2004/06/30/mothdiaries.jpg\" alt=\"The Moth Diaries\" width=\"128\" height=\"195\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  With teenagers flocking to see Mean Girls at the cinema this month, it's a good time to give them this book, a more literary take on the life of a 16-year-old girl cloistered in an American boarding school. The action takes place in the 1960s, but the girls' private dramas unfold in a rarefied world, isolated from the political turmoil of the anti-war demos going on outside. The narrator's best friend, Lucy, becomes enchanted with exotic new girl Ernessa, who has a terrifying secret. The narrator's diaries record her friend's distress, and the tragedies that result. <h2>Time Switch by Matt Chamings (Faber, \u00a35.99)</h2> <p>Some time in the 1870s a boy invents a time machine. Then, in our time, another boy appears at the bottom of a family's garden. The story opens with a funeral in 1879, setting the tone for a tale that is scary, but also funny. This is Chamings' first book, written after he was made redundant, and it is a gripping story.</p> <h2>Poison by Chris Wooding (Scholastic, \u00a312.99)</h2> <p>Poison, stroppy adolescent par excellence, takes the blame when her baby sister is kidnapped. But this is an alternative world of phaeries and changelings. Poison sets off on a journey to rescue her sister, but soon comes up against the limits of her own willpower.</p> <p> <br></p> <h2>Viaduct Child by Patrick Wood (Scholastic, \u00a312.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335504227\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2002/12/05/viaductchild.jpg\" alt=\"Viaduct Child\" width=\"128\" height=\"189\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  Dushma is a non-person, living by a railway viaduct in a London that is recognisably like our own but also scarily different. Dushma is a non-person because a scan carried out when she was still in the womb showed that there was something odd about her brain. The state doesn't like anyone who might be a burden on resources. If you are not registered, you can't go to school, see a doctor or travel on public transport . . . you don't exist. So when the police raid her flat, Dushma escapes into the disused underground tunnels, where she joins up with a gang of teenagers living on their wits. This supremely confident first novel creates an all too believable future world of iron-gloved state control. And Wood doesn't cop out with any patronising \"happy ever afters\". <br> <h2>Malka by Mirjam Pressler (Picador, \u00a39.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335504228\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2002/12/05/malka.jpg\" alt=\"Malka\" width=\"128\" height=\"202\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  It is September 1943. In the sleepy rural Polish backwater close to the Hungarian border, Jewish doctor Hannah Mai is burying her head in the sand, convinced that the Nazis will do her and her two daughters, teenage Minna and seven-year-old Malka, no harm. Then the round-up of Jews begins. Hannah sets off with her daughters towards the border. Then Malka falls sick and, faced with a kind of Sophie's Choice, Hannah takes the one chance offered to get herself and Minna to safety on the understanding that Malka will join them later. Instead, Malka ends up in a Jewish ghetto. Based on a true story, this is a powerful tale which explores not only the Holocaust, but also the complexities of motherhood and the reflexes that make us battle to survive. <h2>Sabriel by Garth Nix (Collins, \u00a312.99)</h2> <p>Another fantasy novel with a strangely named heroine. But that is the only formulaic thing about Garth Nix's darkly complex novel. Sabriel is the daughter of Abhorsen, an \"Old Kingdom\" necromancer who can cross into the land of the dead. Sabriel has inherited his gift but attends a boarding school on the other side of the wall in the New Kingdom. The dead have a nasty habit of not staying dead in the Old Kingdom. When Sabriel receives a message from her father that he is trapped in death, she crosses the wall to try to save him and finds herself face to face with the forces of darkness. Nix weaves a thrilling adventure story as Sabriel must face her fears and journey into death. The writing displays both wit and charm - a rare gift in the fantasy genre.</p> <p> <br></p> <h2>Massive by Julia Bell (Young Picador, \u00a39.99)</h2> <p>Novels for teenagers about eating disorders can be tricky. Bell's debut novel is tough, grimy and truthful as it looks at three women in the same family with food problems. For Carmen's mum Maria, thin equals success. She despairs of her podgy teenage daughter and, when a job opportunity arises in Birmingham, she whisks Carmen away to the big city. Soon Carmen is discovering her roots, including a grandmother who equates food with affection. Bell comes at her subject with a clever obliqueness, using the dislocated experience of the strange city to reflect Maria's and Carmen's fixations on food. A small chink of hope at the end suggests that Carmen will break the vicious circle and that the legacy will not be passed on.</p> <h2>Exodus by Julie Bertagna (Picador, \u00a39.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335504229\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2002/11/15/Exodus.jpg\" alt=\"Exodus by Julie Bertagna\" width=\"128\" height=\"195\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  It is the future. It is more than half a century since the fuel ran out, the oceans rose and drowned the cities, and the ships that supplied the island where Mara was born stopped coming. Now Mara's island is cut off and there is no future for her people. Using the defunct technology that was once the web, Mara discovers there might be a new world out there, with tall cities out of reach of the water. <br>This is a miracle of a novel, one that defies those critics who claim that teenagers don't need novels written specially for them. It has a memorable heroine, is written in stark, simple prose and uses an imaginatively created world to look at our own problems - whether it is global warming or the refugee crisis. This is a book you will remember for the rest of your life. <p> <br></p> <h2>Dovey Coe by Frances O'Roark Dowell (Walker, \u00a34.99)</h2> <p>On the cusp of adolescence, Dovey Coe watches the world intently, feels things strongly and always speaks her mind, which can get her into trouble. Particularly when her pretty elder sister, Caroline, starts toying with the affections of Parnell Caraway, the no-good local rich boy who always gets what he wants and would like to add Caroline to his collection. Over my dead body, thinks Dovey, but it is Parnell who ends up dead and Dovey on trial for his murder.<br>Frances O'Roark Dowell's novel is a delicately written account of life as an outsider in a rural American community in the 20s. Dovey is such a wonderful, strong character that she seems to speak directly to the reader, while the writing has the wistful quality of precious, long-distant memories.</p> <p> <br></p> <h2>The Haunting Of Alaizabel Cray by Chris Wooding (Scholastic, \u00a35.99)</h2> <p>Chris Wooding's novel was passed over for these pages when it was published in hardback last year on the grounds that the cover looked like a record sleeve for a heavy metal band circa 1975 and the fact that it fell into the fantasy horror genre. Big mistake. Inside is one of the most intelligent, atmospheric and spine-tingling novels published for teenagers in recent years.<br>Wooding sets his novel in a London that is most certainly in the future but feels Victorian gothic, where a sinister Masonic society is plotting to take over, a curious Jack the Ripper stalks the streets and in the Old Quarter, overrun with wolves and wych-kin, young Thaniel is doing battle against baby-snatching ghouls, the influential Fraternity and the demons we conjure for ourselves. Breathtakingly brilliant.</p> <p> <br></p> <h2>Warehouse by Keith Gray (Red Fox, \u00a34.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335504230\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2002/07/10/warehouse.jpg\" alt=\"Warehouse\" width=\"128\" height=\"197\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  The Warehouse is a place you can go when you've got nowhere else to go and have run out of money, options and even hope. It may be so rundown that even the young people who call it home describe it as \"Crap Palace\", but it is a place of safety in an uncertain and often dangerous world. Particularly for 15-year-old Robbie who is being used as a punchbag by his unhappy, vicious elder brother Frank, and for poor little rich girl Amy who set out to prove to her parents that she could hack it on her own but wound up in trouble within hours of leaving home. <br>Gray's novel is cleverly structured grabbing the reader by the scruff of the neck and pulling him or her into the entwining stories of this community of outcasts. Tough, tender and true. <p> <br></p> <h2>The Journal of Danny Chaucer (Poet) by Roger Stevens (Dolphin, \u00a34.99)</h2> <p>Novels written in poetic form are big news in the US teenage fiction market, and this home-grown effort is up there with the best. Danny Chaucer is an Adrian Mole without the wimpishness or pomposity, and the gap between Danny's fantasy life and reality is wittily chronicled in a story that follows the thyth of the school year, first love and loss, and all the pains of growing up. Particularly the sledgehammer blow when his best friend goes off with Jenny, the girl of his dreams.<br>Stevens' verse is jaunty, knowing and tart and he gets right inside the dark, dark corners of the adolescent male mind. Although the verse form may take a page or two to get used to, it actually makes this an easier and less daunting book for reluctant readers than the traditional prose novel.</p> <p> <br></p> <h2>Fake by KK Beck (Scholastic Press, \u00a37.99)</h2> <p>Danny has been having problems with his mum and unsympathetic stepdad. Even so, it comes as a shock when he is forcibly shipped off to the Utah desert to attend a jackboot training camp for kids with \"behavioural issues\". Only, he never gets there. Keith, also being escorted to the camp, has a go at the escorts with a crow bar and goes on the run with Danny. But keith has his own interests in mind.<br>This is a thumpingly good thriller, cleverly plotted and tightly written, with a growing Kafkaesque quality as Danny realises that his identity has been stolen and there is nothing he can do about it. As perceptive on parental agendas as it is on teenagers' needs and mindsets, Beck's novel is a racy read with plenty to ponder.</p> <h2>Number 99 by Patrick Cave (Oxford University Press, \u00a36.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335504231\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2002/04/24/number99.jpg\" alt=\"Number 99\" width=\"128\" height=\"204\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  When the camp where 13-year-old traveller Kez lives is raided by police, she thinks it is just another example of prejudiced attitudes towards people with an alternative lifestyle. But with her mother mysteriously missing and the authorities behaving very strangely, it soon becomes apparent that something more sinister is going on. Placed as the 99th foster child of a kindly woman in Camberwell, Kez hooks up with foster child number one (now a flash success in the civil service), and a local boy who is an outcast of a different kind, to get to the bottom of things. Cave's very readable novel doesn't quite hang together as seamlessly as a good thriller should, but the theme is developed without moralising or sentimentality as the novel perceptively considers different ways of life and the choices we make about how we want to live. <h2>Spindle's End by Robin McKinley (David Fickling, \u00a310.99)</h2> <p>When young Katriona pulls the lot that wins her a chance to go to the big city for the little princess's christening day, it changes her life. Suddenly, she finds herself responsible for a tiny little baby whose life is under threat. There are times when ordinariness is the very best disguise something - or someone - can have, and life in Katriona's village doesn't come more ordinary. Ordinary, that is, for a country where magic is \"so thick and tenacious that it settled over the land like chalk dust\". I would recommend very few of the novels written for teenagers that pass through my hands to a discerning adult reader. So this is a bit of a find. An extraordinarily imaginative retelling of the Sleeping Beauty fairytale, McKinley's book is genuinely enchanting but emotionally tough.</p> <p> <br></p> <h2>Break Point by Rosie Rushton (Piccadilly Press, \u00a36.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335504232\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2002/03/27/breakpoint.jpg\" alt=\"Break Point\" width=\"128\" height=\"197\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  Sixteen-year-old Emily is fantastic at tennis and could have a glittering career ahead of her, particularly now that she's won a scholarship to a famous tennis academy. Emily's mum, a single parent, who has scrimped and saved to help Emily on her way, is over the moon. There is just one problem: Emily has had quite enough of tennis. She wants a social life and a chance to stay on at school and do A-levels, go to university and maybe work with an aid agency in Africa. It shows how three successive generations of women - daughter, mother and grandmother- are confined or liberated not just by circumstance and the era into which they were born, but also by the personal choices they make. The teenager who reads this could end up looking at her mother differently. <h2>Changing Emma by John Brindley (Dolphin, \u00a34.99)</h2> <p>On the day Emma gets her GCSE results, her parents win \u00a323m on the lottery. Only her gran remembers to tell her how well she has done. But who cares about school and GCSEs when you are rich beyond your wildest dreams? Soon, old friends are forgotten as Emma is living it up, attracting the attention of the local dreamboat and feeling like a million dollars. This is an old-fashioned morality tale dressed up in a racy, contemporary format and one that is memorable for the way it gets right under its anti-heroine's skin to portray the pain of knowing that you are behaving really badly but unable to stop. Even if they haven't won \u00a323m, most teenagers have been to some of the dark emotional places Emma visits here.</p> <p> <br></p> <h2>Wicca: Book of Shadows by Cate Tiernan (Puffin, \u00a34.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335504233\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2002/02/14/wicca.jpg\" alt=\"Wicca: Shadows\" width=\"128\" height=\"191\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  Do you have a teenage daughter who loves Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Dawson's Creek? Perhaps she is a rather reluctant reader, but don't despair - help is at hand with this new series that crosses high school angst and romance with witchcraft. Sixteen-year-old Morgan is the shy one in a crowd led by her stunning best friend Bree. But when Cal, an attractive new boy, arrives in town and invites them all to join a coven, Morgan finds herself the centre of attention. The discovery that she is a blood witch brings tensions to the surface and romance to a head. Despite the witchcraft, it does deal realistically and sensitively with teenage worries. A new book will be published each month between now and August. <p> <br></p> <h2>Thursday's Child by Sonia Hartnett (Walker, \u00a34.99)</h2> <p>It is the worst years of the Great Depression, and Harper Flute and her family are struggling to survive in a shanty shack on a dusty, unforgiving piece of land. On the day the new baby arrives, Harper takes little brother Tin fishing. Buried in a mud slide, Tin miraculously survives but can't stop tunnelling. Soon he is living permanently underneath the shack burrowing away, with consequences that are both tragic and liberating. In its evocation of the adult world seen through the eyes of a child, this book has the feel of an American classic, such as To Kill a Mockingbird - although its author is Australian. Certainly, few British novelists for young people deliver with such density or so uncompromisingly. Hartnett writes without self-censorship or artificial boundaries between adult and children ' s literature. The result is a deep, and deeply moving, novel.</p>",
  "<p><strong>SPECIFICITY FOR YOU</strong></p> <p>It's the four-headed bureaucratic monster that wants to ban prawn cocktail crisps, stop the sale of bendy bananas and (for all we know) eat our children alive. And now - if you believe Sepp Blatter, Gordon Taylor and Tony Blair - the European Union have got their Brussels snouts set on destroying the beautiful game. Run, footballers run, because your livelihoods are at stake! Well that's what the papers have been telling us. And like the fools we are, the Fiver believed them. Until today anyway, when we just happened to bump into EU culture commissioner Viviane Reding. </p> <p>\"Contrary to what has been alleged in some press articles the Commission has no intention of abolishing the transfer system altogether,\" said Red Viv as she stuck pins into her over-priced Luis Figo doll. \"We just want to see a transfer system that respects both the principles of Community law and the specificity (translation anybody?) of sport.\" Eh? said the Fiver. And so Viv guided us through footballexploitation101, explaining that \"the current system has not prevented the over-commercialisation of sport, the widening of the gap between the economically powerful and less powerful clubs and the fact that players - and especially young players - become objects of speculation\". </p> <p>\"Right on comrade!\" we chimed as Viv expanded further (like a policy balloon). The commission will agree to \"accept transfers in specified periods only\" just like Fifa want, she claimed. And \"compensation reflecting costs incurred by a club for training young people\" should be included in the new law too. To prove her goodwill, Viv even said that, though the EU had waited for ages for Fifa to provide alternatives to the present system, they would still extend the deadline of September 20. All of which makes us want to join the Euro love boat, get on down with the member nations and give them some serious loving - which, after all, is what the EU is all about.

Ray Parlour will be entitled to phone up any Granada employee at any time of the day or night, and ask them what's going on in Coronation Street. Meanwhile Silvinho could land the job of his dreams as a presenter on the Baby Channel.</p> <p>This may all sound a touch fantastical. That's because it is. But all the same the Gunners have done a deal with Granada Media today, selling them 5% of the club (rising to the customary 9.9% if the proposed new stadium goes ahead) as well as a 50/50 share in new company AFC Broadband (so that in future years you'll be able to watch Ray Parlour misplace a pass on your mobile phone). Granada Media will get all this for a combined fee of \u00a347m, plus a couple of Blind Date goody bags. They now have online/broadband deals with the three biggest clubs in the country, following similar arrangements with Liverpool and Man Utd.</p> <p>As is often the case when you've just been handed the GDP of Botswana, Arsenal chairman Peter Hill-Wood was in a pretty chipper mood today. \"This partnership will assist us in meeting Arsenal's two strategic objectives,\" he said. \"First, to build both a world-class team and a new stadium with an increased capacity.

The shock news from this part of the world - besides the temperature, which is as warm as a woolly wombat - is that this very tendon is to be operated on later this week leaving the hunky young Australian out of action for at least three months, and maybe until the new year. Hang on a minute, I'd better hide, there's a team of spies trying to hunt me down in a tiny submarine.</p> <p>That's better (I've hidden between the toes). Anyway, while Harry's tendon has not snapped, it has been painful since the end of last season and the operation will look to tidy up the sheath of the tendon (take it from me, it looks like a squat). A long period of rehabilitation will follow, and so Harry will definitely miss Leeds' matches in the first group stage of Big Cup. Leeds are yet to comment on developments, which leaves me free to go surfing down Harry's alimentary canal.

  "The Prince of Wales today announced a new scholarship in commemoration of Stephen Lawrence, aimed at increasing the number of architects from ethnic minorities. <p>\"How wonderful it would be if, through my foundation, we could help to increase the proportion of black and ethnic minority practitioners in the field of architecture,\" he said.</p> <p>In the inaugural Stephen Lawrence Memorial Lecture, Prince Charles spelt out his vision of the UK's architectural future and paid tribute to the murdered black youth, who had been on a work placement with a firm of architects when he was fatally assaulted in April 1993.</p> <p>Speaking at the Prince's Foundation for Architecture and the Urban Environment in Shoreditch, London, he expressed his \"deepest sympathy\" to Stephen's parents, Neville and Doreen, who were present at the lecture.</p> <p>\"Stephen Lawrence was cruelly robbed of the chance to develop his potential talents in the field of architecture. I am sure that his parents, who did so much to support him in his ambition, will join with me in hoping that the Trust established in Stephen's memory, and my Foundation, can find a mutual interest in working together to find more opportunities for those with talent to find a role in building design.\"</p> <p>The Prince pleaded for \"an architecture of the heart\" and renewed his attack on unsightly modern buildings.</p> <p>Warning of a \"tide of uglification\" threatening the country's heritage, he said: \"\u0085the quality of architecture, and what can only be described as the thoughtlessness of the design of so many of our built environments, serves to undermine the quality of life of the communities in which they stand.\"</p> <p>He singled out the art of \"place-making\" as having fallen victim to 20th-century architecture and urban planning practice. \"There has, I feel, been a tragic loss of respect, often even of any acknowledgement, of the value of craftsmanship, artistry and tradition in the teaching and practice of architecture.\"</p> <p>Questioning basic design rationale, he said, \"Sadly, it seems to remain the case that architecture, and especially the process of architectural training, largely, and sometimes completely, ignores the value of a grounding in traditional techniques that, until fairly recently, were considered to be the life blood of any designer's learning. </p> <p>\"This, to my mind, is a short-sighted tragedy and, I believe, serves to undermine the very integration of craftsmanship, art and building that is surely the ultimate ambition of architecture itself.\" </p> <p>The foundation's purpose, he said, was to stem this decline. \"We are in desperate need of people who have a real sensitivity to their environment and who understand how to blend the past sympathetically with the present.\"</p> <p>Later in the day, the Prince stunned members of the public visiting Buckingham Palace by touring through the state rooms, accompanied by private protection speech. Continuing the theme of his lecture, he alluded to a certain on-going political furore, quipping to visitor Ros Taylor, 76: \"It is better than going to the Dome.\" </p> <p>A spokesman for the Prince's Foundation said the lecture would be an annual event aimed at inspiring young black and Asian people. He added: \"We wanted someone high profile to do the first lecture, and someone who is interested in architecture and our environment.\"</p>",

  "<p>The future of beleaguered sports website Worldsport.com is looking increasingly tentative, following unsuccessful attempts to secure fresh funding since the business went into administrative receivership at the start of July.</p> <p> The company, which is currently being bank-rolled by millionaire chairman and founder Alan Callan, is understood to have racked up debts of around $6m (\u00a33.9m) since the business was relaunched in February this year, according to a well-placed insider. Callan is believed to be looking to raise more than $8m (\u00a35.2m) to enable to business to stay afloat into 2001.</p> <p> Worldsport, an online niche sports broadcaster that works with sporting federations, such as the World Olympians Association and the Global Association of International Sports Federations, called in London-based insolvency adviser Leonard Curtis to rescue it on July 7. In the two months since being appointed, Leonard Curtis has not been able to help Worldsport.com find the large amount of funding it needs. </p> <p> A spokeswoman for receivers Leonard Curtis said they were still talking to a number of potential investors. A meeting is scheduled for three months after the receivers were called in to determine the future of the company.</p> <p> Chairman Callan is currently receiving treatment in the US for an illness. In his absence former Daily Mirror deputy editor Brendon Parsons is running the business and overseeing the funding crisis. Mike Miller, headhunted from BBC Sport, is also another remaining key member of the management committee. Worldsport was unavailable for comment.</p> <p> Personnel at Worldsport has been cut dramatically, from its June high of 178 to the current level of around 70, most of which was the result of 80 in July at the beginning of July or resignations since then. The company is now being run by a skeleton management committee, following the departures of the chief financial office, the chief accountant, personnel director, editor and in-house lawyer. Nevertheless, the remaining staff bill is said to be more than \u00a3500,000 per month.</p> <p> Contractually, Worldsport is obliged to honour the partnerships it has with various official sports organisations and federations, although cash-flow problems have caused a number of problems. These 150 or so deals Worldsport has signed are believed to have already cost the company a few million pounds. However a number of federations served notice on Worldsport in July for breach of contract. Leonard Curtis wouldn't comment on the letters. </p> <p> Worldsport was relaunched in February but went in voluntary receivership and laid off staff in July when it became apparent that funds were running low, creditors were not being paid and site traffic was falling short of projections. At the time, Worldsport said it would have secured funding within two weeks but the proposed deal with venture capital house Hicks Muse Tate &amp; Furst fell through. Staff were then told funding would be secured by August 21, but again nothing materialised. </p> <p> Given the saturated nature of the online sports market, an out-and-out recovery looks unlikely, particularly since there is very limited demand for the type of esoteric sporting coverage (korfball, women's squash etc.) provided by Worldsport.</p>",
  "<p>Britt Allcroft, creator of the Thomas the Tank Engine TV series and deputy chairman of the Britt Allcroft Company, is to step down from the board after a radical revamp.</p> <p>The rights-owning family entertainment studio is to change its name to Gullane Entertainment as part of an aggressive push into the global market. The news came as the company's annual pre-tax profits jumped from \u00a34.8m to \u00a36.78m - up 39%. </p> <p>Chief executive William Harris said: \"Britt is a very creative person and has been the corner stone of the company for so long, but she has not been involved in the day-to-day running of the company. She will continue to build the Thomas brand and come up with new characters.\"</p> <p>Harris said the name change reflected the company's progress since its flotation in 1996, when it relied heavily on the success of the Thomas franchise. It has since paid \u00a314m for Media Merchants, inheriting a number of children's programme rights, and launched an internet operation.</p> <p>The company also owns the rights to children\u00d5s programmes Sooty and Art Attack, with film studio Disney backing an overseas licensing campaign for the latter. </p> <p>Harris said the company is on the lookout for more lucrative franchises in the \u00a314m price bracket.</p> <p>The blip on Britt Allcroft's figures was the Thomas and the Magic Railroad film, starring Alec Baldwin, which was savaged by critics on both sides of the Atlantic and pulled from screens within weeks of its release.</p> <p>Harris defended the film, which has grossed \u00a312m worldwide but incurred \u00a326m production and marketing costs, saying it has boosted the international profile of the Thomas brand.</p> <p>\"We put $3.3m (\u00a32.2m) into the film, and collecting $20m (\u00a313m) from other companies for film prints and advertising is not a bad return. The amount of promotion has had a massive impact on the company,\" he said.</p> <p>The company's own research showed that 90% of under five-year-olds enjoyed the film, although Harris has ruled out sequels for the next few years after distributors had their fingers badly burnt at the box office.</p> <p>Britt Allcroft shares rose 10p to 615p in early trading.</p>",
  "Michael Heseltine today accused Tory leader William Hague of using the Millennium Dome's financial troubles to score \"easy political points\". <p>The former deputy prime minister, responsible for the dome in John Major's administration, said that closing the flagging south London attraction would not make financial sense. </p> <p>\"The effect would be to actually put the costs onto the small business creditors and the staff,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. </p> <p>\"Now I defy anyone to stand up in their editorial columns or in the House of Commons and say that they think the millennium commission should renege on its obligations, and it should allow the creditors go hang. </p> <p>He continued: \"If that's what you believe, say it, but don't make easy political points that there's money to be saved in closing the Dome, because there isn't.\"</p> <p>Mr Heseltine acknowledged that there were many aspects of the project which could have been done better, but argued that in terms of regenerating the formerly blighted Greenwich peninsula area, it had been a considerable success. </p> <p>\"The overriding argument for locating the dome at Greenwich was to end those blighted years and to regenerate the site. In that we have been successful,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Hague today repeated his call for the dome's immediate closure. Responding to Mr Heseltine's claim that he was not fully aware of the facts when he made his first call for closure yesterday, he today argued that the government was sitting on the facts. </p> <p>\"The government won't publish the PriceWaterhouse report into the dome. They don't want anybody to have the full facts,\" he said. </p> <p>Arriving at the CBI's Global Scotland conference in Glasgow, the Tory leader coupled his demand with an accusation that the prime minister was shielding his old friend Lord Falconer, the cabinet office minister responsible for the project. </p> <p>\"I think he [Mr Blair] is protecting his old flatmate [Lord Falconer]. The only reason they are keeping it open is to save the government's face.\"</p> <p>\"It is not a success, it has become worse than a national embarrassment and it ought now to be closed,\" Mr Hague repeated. He added that the \u00a347m additional lottery funding given to the dome earlier in the week could have been donated to good causes instead. </p>",

There are famous names, and some unexpected ones too, giving their revealing choices. JK Rowling picks one about a boy who is eaten.</p> <h2>Boing! by Sean Taylor (Walker Books, \u00a310.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335504193\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2004/08/25/boing1.jpg\" alt=\"Boing! by Sean Taylor\" width=\"128\" height=\"195\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  While his young son watches television, the Great Elastic Marvel, five times world trampolining champion, is practising the deadly difficult quadruple, headfirst flip. Practising so hard he falls out of the window, and begins a series of death-defying leaps round the neighbourhood, lively exclamations as he goes. Buoyant text, exuberant drawings. <br> <h2>How to Catch a Star by Oliver Jeffers (HarperCollins, \u00a310.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335504194\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2004/08/25/star1.jpg\" alt=\"How to Catch a Star by Oliver Jeffers\" width=\"128\" height=\"128\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  A beautifully told, beautifully painted story about reaching for the stars. The little boy loves star-gazing so much he wants to hold a star of his own. It's a scheme made for disappointment, but after setbacks, he does succeed. Jeffers' story-telling satisfies while still leaving room for a child's own imagination to decide what actually happened. <br> <h2>Is It Because? by Tony Ross (Andersen Press, \u00a39.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335504195\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2004/07/28/isitbecause.jpg\" alt=\"Is It Because?\" width=\"128\" height=\"195\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  The latest from the author of the I Want my Potty series is a book about bullying. The central character is a young boy who is being picked on by a certain Peregrine Ffrogg. Fortunately, he has an ally in a clever dog, whom he asks all the questions about why these horrible things are happening to him. Brightly coloured characters on pale watercolour backgrounds act out all the boy's musings about the bullyIf only the ending were true - that the bully's victim always comes out confident and on top. But still, this is a book that even the very small will understand, and all will appreciate the flights of imagining. <h2>Wanda's First Day by Mark Sperring (Chicken House, \u00a310.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335504196\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2004/07/28/wandasfirstday.jpg\" alt=\"Wanda's First Day\" width=\"128\" height=\"128\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  Wanda is off to school for the first time, complete with slimy lunchbox. She wears black and rides a broomstick. When she gets to the classroom, she finds that everyone else is wearing pretty dresses and has gossamer wings. Her spells turn out differently from theirs too - larger, uglier.Wanda asks Miss Dewdrop, the teacher, whether she is in the right class, a worry further compounded when a class of witches go past with one fairy in their midst. \"Do you like it here, Wanda?\" asks Miss Dewdrop. When Wanda says yes, her teacher replies that is all that is needed to belong. Sparkly drawings for a happy story. <h2>The World Came to My Place Today by Jo Redman, illustrated by Ley Honor Roberts (Eden Project, \u00a310.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335504197\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2002/12/05/worldcame.jpg\" alt=\"World Came\" width=\"128\" height=\"131\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  Not a novel, but a wonderfully imaginative book which shows children how their everyday environment connects with the wider world. When George's little sister gets chickenpox, he can't go out to play and wishes that the world could visit him. Grandpa points out that it already has, showing George the rice in his cereal that hails from China, the oranges in his juice that came from Spain, and the newspaper that is made out of Canadian trees. Mingling its narrative with an entertaining geography lesson, this is part activity book and part storybook. The appealing drawings are cleverly mixed, collage-style, with photo-graphs. An original, enjoyable book that performs the conjuring trick of making the world seem at once bigger and smaller than it really is. <br> <h2>Moonthief by Roger McGough, illustrated by Penny Dann (Kingfisher, \u00a39.99)</h2> <p>\"Look there's a new moon out tonight,\" says Bobby bear to his sweetheart Betty. \"I wonder what they did with the old one,\" replies Betty. This is a book for anyone who has ever had the same thought. It is slightly mad and whimsical, but then it is written by that master of the daft and improbable, Roger McGough. Bobby comes up with all sorts of ideas about what you could do with the moon if you crept up into the sky and stole it away when no one was looking. This \"moonthief\" reckons it would be great for housing a goldfish, for use as a Frisbee or for tenpin bowling. The saccharine ending aside, this is a thoroughly enjoyable piece of moonshine. The five-year-old I tried it on had no objections at all and loved the charming illustrations.<br> </p> <h2>Utterly Me, Clarice Bean by Lauren Child (Orchard Books, \u00a38.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335504198\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2002/10/23/bean.jpg\" alt=\"Utterly Me, Clarice Bean\" width=\"128\" height=\"181\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  Lauren Child is a star in the picture- book market and plenty of children will already know Clarice Bean, her off-the-wall heroine for the under-eights. Now Child has written a full-length story about Clarice and her obsession with detective novels, an obsession that proves useful when strange things start happening, the school homework project competition is announced and her best friend disappears. Although this longer novel is very welcome, with fewer pictures, the charm of our heroine is somewhat diminished and it is perhaps Child's misfortune to be publishing at a time when there is already a glut of books for this age group featuring ditsy Bridget Jones-style eight-year-olds. But for a few good belly laughs, Clarice Bean wins hands down every time. <br> <h2>Tell Me If You Like . . . by Gerard Greverand, illus Magali Bardos (Pavillion, \u00a310.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335504199\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2002/10/23/tellmeifyoulike.jpg\" alt=\"Tell Me If You Like\" width=\"128\" height=\"178\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  This one will tickle the fancy of adults as well as kids. As is so often the case with the best children's books, it is based on a very simple idea. It takes the form of a series of questions: Tell me if you like wobbling a loose tooth with your tongue? Tell me if you like rummaging about in your nose for the biggest bogey? Tell me if you like smelling the warm, wet road after a storm? There is literally page after page in this vein, ranging from the lyrical to the downright silly and even the philosophical - with witty illustrations that amply assist in jogging the memory banks. It whisked me straight back to my own childhood thoughts, sensations and experiences, and also gripped the imagination of my seven-year-old who was inspired to start compiling her own lists of likes. <br> <h2>Beware of Girls by Tony Blundell (Penguin, \u00a34.99)</h2> <p>A long time ago, Tony Blundell wrote a very entertaining book called Beware of Boys. This follow-up is just as sharp and funny, and offers an enjoyable spin on the Little Red Riding Hood story for those of us who always thought that Little Red Riding Hood was nice but rather dim (fancy not knowing your granny from a wolf in drag).</p> <p>This little girl is definitely the smartest child in the forest, so when the big bad wolf reads a book about little girls and grandmas and finds that the pictures make him very hungry indeed, he is outwitted and defeated before you can say \"snack on legs\".</p> <p>Blundell's pictures are as witty as his text, and this version of the traditional tale, with its very modern heroine, will delight young readers - even boys and maybe even wolves.</p> <h2>Looking After Murphy by Jamie Rix, illustrated by John Bendall-Brunello (Hodder, \u00a34.99)</h2> <p>Sally and Jim are not at all sure about their Granny Lally. Can it really be the case that the cream is sour so they shouldn't touch it, particularly when Granny Lally looks like the cat that got the cream? And would her doctor really order her to watch at least an hour of Celebrity Knitting every day? When Granny is asked to look after the children's hamster and he runs away, she learns that the truth may be painful - but is better in the long run. Trying to pass off another hamster from the pet shop doesn't work at all.</p> <p>Jamie Rix's simple story broaches the difficult subjects of lying and lost pets (both of which give parents sleepless nights) with humour and enough ambiguity to make sure that this engaging tale is always a story and never a tract.</p> <h2>Man on the Moon (a day in the life of Bob) by Simon Bartram (Templar, \u00a39.95)</h2> <p>This book is as irresistible to parents as it is to young boys. It shows great humour as it tells the story of Bob who has the job of being the man in the moon. Well, when you think about it, someone has got to do the job. So why not Bob, who when he isn't in his spacesuit for the journey to and from work wears a Fair Isle sweater and lives in a house just like you and me?</p> <p>In fact, Bob is such a down-to-earth bloke that he refuses to believe in aliens. Silly man. You and I, the readers, know aliens exist because they keep popping up on the pages, just out of Bob's view or when he's got his back turned to vacuum the moon. Anyone who liked Toy Story will fall for Bob, for Bartram's artlessly clever prose and the big, bold, wonderfully-detailed illustrations.</p> <h2>Jethro Byrde, Fairy Child by Bob Graham (Walker, \u00a310.99)</h2> <p>Most books that have anything to do with fairies bring me out in a rash. They so often seem to have been written in icing sugar. This one by Australian writer Bob Graham, who won the 2000 Smarties Gold Prize for Max is different, very different. In fact, mixed up in here with the story of the fairy travellers who Annabelle finds among the cement and weeds, is a very entertaining fable about tolerance of difference. Even the fairy folk travellers defy all stereotype. They sell hot dogs and hamburgers.</p> <p>Graham's books bubble with good humour and the knowledge that there are many ways of looking at the world provided you keep an open mind. The drawings make much of perspective and are cleverly mixed into the text, almost comic book-style, for variety.</p> <h2>The Quigleys by Simon Mason (David Fickling, \u00a310.99)</h2> <p>A proper little novel for small people, Mason's book takes the form of four interlinking stories about the Quigley family: mum (always tired), dad (a bit useless), son Will and daughter Lucy. Each chapter concentrates on one member of the family.</p> <p>The first about dad's inadequacies as a babysitter is the weakest in the collection. But the others are a giggle, providing wonderful snapshots of the chaos and joys of family life, all the ups and downs - including mum's birthday celebration and Lucy's determination to dress as a bee when a bridesmaid. Mason's prose is gently humorous, but he also gets at the often-unspoken truth of family life: that what can go wrong will go wrong, and that however much you plan, things seldom turn out as you expect.<br> </p> <h2>Lily's Purple Plastic Purse by Kevin Hanks (Hodder, \u00a34.99)</h2> <p>If you have a child starting school in September, rush out and buy this book at once. If you already have a child in infants, it will make a brilliant end-of-term present for their teacher. It has an exuberant heart that beats with sheer joy about the pleasures of school and inspirational teachers.<br>Lily loves everything about school and particularly her teacher Mr Slinger, who is her hero. But when she is given a beautiful purple plastic purse, she is so keen to show it off to the class that she gets in to trouble. Will it be the end of a beautiful relationship?</p> <p>There is one thing wrong with this book: the print is so small, it is hard for early readers to tackle alone. Otherwise, everything about it is just so perfect you will share it again and again.</p> <h2>Six Storey House by Geraldine McCaughrean (Hodder, \u00a37.99)</h2> <p>It is great to come across a novel written for this age group that feels like a proper book rather than an extension of a school-reading scheme. Constructed like a literary version of one of those cross-section books that show you the interior workings of a building, Geraldine McCaughrean's quirky story gets to the emotional heart of a big old house and, more particularly, the people who live there. Among the motley crew of engaging residents are lonely Dexi, whose single mother is always at work; Widow Shoo, who is so distracted by her washing that she hangs the baby on the line; and Mr Tring, the composer who has lost his tune. A modern fairytale where \"can't\" becomes \"can\" and the six-storey house is transformed into seven, this is a delicately written tale for children just embarking on books with chapters.</p> <h2>The Adventures of a Nose by Viviane Schwarz, illustrated by Joel Stewart (Walker, \u00a310.99)</h2> <p>This is a really original and quirky story about a nose. A nose? Yes, a nose that is looking for its place in the world, where it can \"fit in and really stick out\". The quest is a long one and requires journeys to places that are cold and tingly, hot and spicy - and visits to the library and doctor. I shall long treasure the image of the Nose lying on the psychiatrist's couch. The great thing about this is that it is more than a one-joke story and works on several different levels. On one hand it is a fable about being yourself and finding your place in the world, and on the other hand it makes the reader think about the functions of the nose. It is a very clever book - and enormous fun.</p> <h2>Claydon Was a Clingy Child by Cressida Cowell (Hodder, \u00a39.99)</h2> <p>Claydon will not let go of his mother's leg. He is convinced that it is safer that way. So wherever mummy goes, Claydon goes too, even though mum is a dangerous-sports enthusiast and spends her days skateboarding, sky-diving and playing rugby. Soon Claydon's terrified teddy is pointing out that although mum is \"an excellent person in many respects she is also - and I mean this nicely - a maniac\", and that Claydon would be much safer playing on his tricycle. What teddy doesn't bank on is that a taste for death-defying feats obviously runs in the family. Perfect for the clingy child, or indeed anyone of any age who is suffering from separation anxiety, Cowell's book is a stereotype-busting, laugh-aloud delight that bursts with life and colour while offering gentle reassurance.</p> <h2>The Kiss That Missed by David Melling (Hodder, \u00a310.99)</h2> <p>You are probably right to be suspicious of any children ' s book that is aimed at the St Valentine's market, as so often these stories are really for adults who have never grown up. But it is worth making an exception for this wonderfully comic little charmer. Melling has fairytale fun with the story of a bedtime kiss that is blown by the king to his son that misses and bounces out of the window and into the night. Instead of \"follow that taxi\", it is a case of \"follow that kiss\", a job entrusted to the accident-prone loyal knight who soon finds himself in the wood where there are \"wild creatures with wild eyes, too much hair and very bad manners\". There is plenty more in this vein, and a dragon besides, but eventually it is happy ever after. Melling's illustrations are as snazzy and snappy as his prose - and it's fine to be reminded that bedtime rituals cannot be hurried.</p> <h2>All Your Own Teeth by Adrienne Geoghegan, illustrated by Cathy Gale (Bloomsbury, \u00a39.99)</h2> <p>Stuart lives in the city and is determined to be an artist. When he has painted everything the city has to offer, he sets off to the jungle in search of wild animals. He puts up a sign: \"Wanted: Hansum wild animal to sit still for painting. Must have all your own teeth and a nice big smile.\" But Stuart has never seen a wild animal before and he thinks that the elephant's trunk is ugly, the cheetah is far too spotty and the hippo looks like a chocolate pudding. Geoghegan's story, illustrated with zany comic gusto, will make both parents and children laugh out loud, not least because it has a nasty twist worthy of Roald Dahl. A very enjoyable bedtime snack and a useful reminder that it is never wise to insult a crocodile's friends.</p> <h2>Slow Loris by Alexis Deacon (Hutchinson, \u00a310.99)</h2> <p>This is a really thrilling debut from young writer-illustrator Alexis Deacon. Its originality jumps out of the covers. Slow Loris lives in the zoo and everybody, including the visitors and the other animals, thinks that he is really boring because he does everything so slowly. What they don't know is that, at night, when they are all asleep, he is really fast. When his secret gets out, soon all the animals are enjoying a wild nocturnal life. Most illustrations for the young are bright and breezy; in contrast, Deacon's drawings are dark, murky, full of detail and totally compelling. While Slow Loris going fast is a blur, all the humans in the zoo look sleepy or bored. This is off the wall and sly in a way that books for this age group aren't supposed to be.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"#a\">Early career</a> <strong>|</strong> <a href=\"#b\">Diner</a> <strong>|</strong> <a href=\"#c\">The Baltimore movies</a> <strong>|</strong> <a href=\"#d\">Homicide</a> </p> <p><strong>Adrian Wootton:</strong> Welcome to the National Film Theatre.</p> <p><strong>Barry Levinson:</strong> Thank you very much.</p> <p><strong>AW:</strong> We're going to follow a very standard format. We're going to talk about Liberty Heights in a few minutes and then open up for questions from the audience. I just want to do a bit of a career rewind and talk to you about some of the other high spots of your career before Liberty Heights, and go back to near the beginning and how you actually became involved in the entertainment business. In particular, television, because I know you kind of fell into the entertainment business, it wasn't a kind of choice or career decision, you didn't go to a film school, you basically got to work for a television company and then started writing for comedy shows.</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> Well it's kind of convoluted way of going about things. I worked at a local television station and I got a chance to direct and do all those things - worked kiddie shows, Ranger House show with the hand puppets and things like that. I finally ultimately got tired of all that and moved to Los Angeles and didn't really know what to do with myself. I got involved with an acting school and studied for a couple years. They used to have improv exercises that you would work on and you would do improvs. Craig Nelson who is an actor and is in a show called Coach in the United States. We began to do some improvisational stuff and we used to get laughs and things. I said to him \"Gee (because we were both broke) we'll play some clubs and pick up a dollar here and there.\" And so we started doing that while we were still studying. Then it occurred to me that I didn't have to do an improv to do that, I could just write it down. I never really wanted to be an actor. And that was the beginning of it, I began to write things down and eventually became a writer on a television show.</p> <p><strong>AW:</strong> I am right in thinking, be very interested to hear about it, you actually came over and worked on a particular British television show in the early 1970s.</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> Yeah, Marty Feldman.</p> <p><strong>AW:</strong> What kind of experience was that?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> Yeah, well it was great. Marty was an extraordinary character. I was here for one year. It was great as an American to come over and working on the show. We wrote a lot of material, there were a lot of film pieces and also some video stuff as well. I got a chance to meet Spike Milligan, who was a recurring actor on the show - you know it was an incredible period in the early 70s.</p> <p><strong>AW:</strong> And then you went obviously, back to the States and carried on writing for television and you did things like the Carol Burnett show. Then you met Mel Brooks who became a kind of mentor would you say - at least in the early stage. . .?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> I got a chance to work with Mel Brooks on two of his films: Silent Movie and High Anxiety. But the way it would work is that we would come to meet for breakfast in a delicatessen and we would meet and then we'd go back to the studio, then we'd have lunch. Then we'd write \"til the middle of the afternoon. And ultimately when we finished and he was filming it, I had a chance to be on the set everyday when it was being filmed and through the editing process and the scoring process. So it was like being an apprentice - going to film school - for me. I did that for two films and actually acted in High Anxiety in one crazy little scene. . . </p> <p><strong>AW:</strong> The shower scene. . . </p> <p> <strong>BL:</strong> The shower scene where I'm screaming \"Here's your paper\". It's an interesting thing how that actually happened and the reason I did it. One day we were talking the Hitchcock movies. I said I was imitating Bernard Herrmann's score in the shower scene which has the \"Heh! Heh! Heh! Heh!\" thing there. We were talking one day and we were kidding and I said we could have this scene where this guy comes in and says \"Here! Here! Here! Here's your paper\". We laughed at that and then Mel said eventually \"You have to do that scene\". So that happened. In doing the two movies I began to see things and go, \"Gee, what happens if the camera is over here, what happens if that, what happens if this is a little quicker, what happens if you do this\" and y'know everyone has there own way of working, but I began to think about how rooms should look etc and that was really the beginning of me thinking about that possibility.</p> <p><strong>AW:</strong> Then obviously you had your directorial debut, you were writing screenplays with your then partner as well, but you made your directorial debut with Diner. Which, I think everyone was laughing at the clip, has gone down as a kind of contemporary classic. I just wondered how difficult it was to get that movie made at the time, particularly as it didn't fit a particular niche.</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> No it didn't. It was by accident it got made. I think MGM in the early 80s was going through all kinds of transitions etc, the cost of the movie was only going to be about $5m, and I think, because they never. . . I only know this from when I saw the dailies, they said apparently I was in Baltimore filming and they said that the guys look awfully old for high school. What they thought was it was one of those high school y'know comedies, high school kind of fool around comedy. Apparently nobody really read it, it was a cheap movie, it fit their schedule in terms of things so fine, let the guy make that high school comedy. I used to work with Mel Brooks so they figured oh it's going to be one of those really silly movies and that's how it got made. And when they saw it they were truly appalled. I say that, not joking, because they really did not want to release the movie. In the beginning, Diner opened up in two cities, St Louis and Phoenix, Arizona. And they pulled it out of release. They said, \"See it doesn't work\". By accident, Pauline Kael had seen the film and another critic from the Rolling Stone had seen it and they asked, \"Where's it playing?\" Well it was not playing anywhere. And they said \"Well, we're going to run a review of it\". MGM panicked and thought that there were going to be these major reviews and the film is not playing in the United States. And so they quickly put it in on a Friday with two days notice in New York City at this festival theatre. And it opened up to sold out business for the entire weekend. Then the following weekend it broke a house record and they still didn't think it would play anywhere and so it went city by city breaking house records. It never did play nationally, it slowly went around the country.</p> <p><strong>AW:</strong> But presumably because it got those reviews and also it had fabulous casting - people who went on to become very big stars obviously Micky Rourke and Ellen Barkin. It must have helped you to get the next movie made. </p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> You have a movie and it proves itself and then certain things happen. Actually I have to give a lot of credit to Robert Redford who saw the movie early on, really enjoyed it. We sat, we met a couple times, he said, \"I'd love to do a movie with you\" and I'm thinking, this is Robert Redford. You know, he's won an Academy Award, he's talking to me about directing a movie he's in. So you just think that it's Hollywood stuff or whatever. Until one time we were talking and I was mentioning an idea for movie and he said \"I don't know, it doesn't feel right for me\" and we began talking about baseball, because he's a big baseball fan, and I'm also quite a fan. We began talking about baseball, which led to The Natural. He had a version and that's what happened - we went off and did that film.</p> <p><strong>AW:</strong> Then obviously you made a succession of films, I haven't got time to touch on all of them, I'm sure that there is going to be questions about a number of them as we open up, but you became an extremely commercially successful director in the 1980s. You won Academy Awards for things like Rain Man, you had enormous success with Good Morning Vietnam. The question I wanted to ask you, spanning those films, is about working with talent. You've talked about Robert Redford, you've now worked three times with Dustin Hoffman: Wag the Dog, Sphere and obviously Rain Man and you've worked with actors who are traditionally regarded as being difficult. Difficult stars, people who are incredibly demanding. I wondered if you could talk a little bit about the process of working with those stars and what's the secret, in your terms of actually managing that?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> I don't know. Some actors are supposed to be very difficult, but I've not found that to be the situation. All I try to do is create an atmosphere that seems comfortable enough, that it removes tension and everyone feels free. If they feel free then behaviour happens, small moments happen and that's what ultimately works the best for me. So they can't just do anything, but within this kind of controlled freedom is where I basically try to function really. A lot of time mistakes are very interesting - you look for the behaviour that's not the one you expect. It's the moment that you don't expect, it's the moment that in an audience that you think \"Oh, that's interesting. How did that happen. Oh, I like that\". It's those moments, those odd moments that you look for and sometimes by creating this kind of loose atmosphere you find those little moments that somehow mean a lot to an audience when they really register right.</p> <p><strong>AW:</strong> In terms of obviously this period, during the 1980s and early 90s and again with Liberty Heights, you've kept on returning back to Baltimore to movies which you write, direct and produce. Can you talk a little about the Baltimore films, leading us into Liberty Heights? They obviously do come from a personal wellspring apart from you coming from Baltimore and you talking about aspects of your childhood and aspects of your own autobiography kind of mixed up with fiction. I just wondered, did you ever plan that you were going to carry on making movies about Baltimore?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> No, it was purely accidental. First of all, just to get Diner made would have been an achievement in that I got a chance to direct. Tin Men came about only because of a comment, and it stuck in my head when I was filming Diner, the assistant director put the extras in. When I came in, I said, \"There's too many young people to the left, we need older extras on the left\". He said \"Why?\" and I said \"Because that's where the tin men sit\". And he said \"The tin men?\" And I told him that these were the guys, they were older and they would come in at X number at this particular time at night and they would hang around and I started to tell a few stories about the tin men that we knew. So that kind of stuck in my head and then four years later or whatever it was, all of a sudden I kind of hit on an idea that I thought would be interesting and that's where Tin Men came from. But then I never thought there would be a third one until one day Avalon occurred to me. When I began to think about the head of the family, the storyteller, the rise of television which became the new storyteller, the break-up of the American family as an idea and then Avalon came. So, and then suddenly, Liberty Heights which was only based, or came about because of a review that I read of Dustin Hoffman in Sphere. The comment that I found so peculiar just kicked off this whole idea for Liberty Heights.</p> <p><strong>AW:</strong> The films that you write and direct, obviously there is, apart from the personal nature in them, the Baltimore City, there is quite a radical difference between those and many of your other movies. Because of the writing, actually and because of the - we heard everyone laughing at the Bonanza conversation in Tin Men or the roast beef conversation in Diner. Those conversations overlapping dialogue, the rhythm of conversation, the importance of that in these men's and women's lives seems to be at the heart of those movies.</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> I mean, it certainly it is a strong part. It's finding those nonsensical pieces of conversation that we all do all the time. We do all the time. When we're talking on the telephone, there are arguments with people who agree when they both think that they disagree. There are all those moments and misunderstandings that are part of the human condition and when you can find one that works, that is appropriate to what you're doing, it's interesting and it gets their attention and in many ways it helps expand character without having to have exposition. You kind of get it. The roast beef sandwich in Diner is really about the friendship. They know each other so well that you don't have to say, \"How long have you known each other?\" \"We've known each other for seven years\". We don't need that. We just know from that what this relationship is about. It's interesting to do, it's fun to do when you can. It's always the thing that upsets studio people because they're always appalled.</p> <p><strong>AW:</strong> Why?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> Well, I mean, when I did Diner and they looked at the cut of the film and one of the executives said, \"You know you've got a lot to learn about editing\". And I said, \"Well, I'm sure that I do\", I said, \"As an example?\" He said, \"Well you know like that roast beef sandwich thing. He asks for the roast beef, he's not going to go on about it, he's going to ask for it, boom, cut, get on with the story.\" And I said, \"But that is the story\". I told you earlier, they're going to show Tin Men on television in the States and they have to cut it for time, they have to make it shorter. So they sent me suggested cuts that they would make. One of them was to eliminate the Bonanza piece, \"Just take that out. You don't need that\". And so it's always, I've had that all my life, \"You don't need it, you don't need it\". And ultimately if you can hold onto it, you do, because part of that is the flavour. <strong>[ <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/levinson/0913levinson1.ra\">Listen to the soundclip</a> ]</strong></p> <p>The interesting thing about movies, it's not always - y'know, you have to have structure etc and all those things, but an audience responds, in many ways, we walk away and certain things stay in our heads that are memorable. We remember Casablanca, there are a couple moments that we remember. I always think of films and when you talk to someone in the street about a movie and you say, \"What do you think of that movie?\" and they say \"I love that film\". You say, \"Really, what about the scene with the sister?\". \"Oh I thought that was terrible, hated that\". \"Well what about the song?\", \"That didn't make any sense to me, didn't like that either.\" \"Well what about the thing with the. . .\" \"Oh, was kinda fake, I hated that\". \"Well what did ya think of the movie?\" \"I loved it\". And you'd say, \"Well, why\". Certain things we respond to in a way and therefore we love a movie and conversely so, we can see a movie and didn't like it. You say, \"Well what about that?\" \"Oh, I loved that, that was very good\". \"Well what about so and so?\" \"That was terrific, the way they did that\". \"What did you think of the movie?\". \"I didn't care for it.\" \"Why?\" I don't know. It's the magic of it all that's very hard for any of us to understand. What is it that we connect to that stays with us it's hard to understand.</p> <p><strong>AW:</strong> I want to talk about something that it also set in Baltimore, but is radically different from your movies. Homicide, on the face of it, is not something one would automatically associate with Barry Levinson being interested in because you've never been particularly interested in things of that genre - the genre of the crime thriller, and obviously it casts a completely different light on Baltimore in terms of its depiction of its streets and depiction of the environment. What led you to create Homicide?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> Well it was sent to me, well because almost everything that is written in Baltimore is sent to me. And David Simon, who was a writer for the Baltimore Sun, spent one year following the homicide squad in Baltimore and he chronicled that period of time. This was sent to me as a possibility for a feature film. And I thought well, if you do a feature it will be a homicide squad and you'll have a couple of stories and I thought it would be better as a television series where you keep the episodes and just see how these people have to deal with death on a daily basis. What is that about, how does it affect them and their relationships etc - so I thought it was better served as a television show. I ultimately got a commitment from NBC and then we went off to shoot it. I directed and cast the original piece. And what I thought would be a departure, was not to follow, in a sense, a traditional cameral style, because it is not an action show, it doesn't have chases, etc, to let the camera create action by the fact that it was slightly off, there was jump cuts and things like that that created a certain kind of energy to it and being fairly ragged and crude in a way and that was its style. It caught on in the States and we had a nice seven-year run. </p> <p> <strong>Sound clips</strong><br> \u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/levinson/0913levinson1.ra\">On cuts that the studio wanted to Diner</a> (53 seconds) <br>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/levinson/0913levinson2.ra\">On his childhood</a> (1min 28) <br>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/levinson/0913levinson3.ra\">On film language and editing</a> (1min 16) <br>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/levinson/0913levinson4.ra\">Life imitating art in Wag the Dog</a> (1min 41)</p>",
  "<p>Nasa has again extended its deadline for completion of the International Space Station, which is now targeted for 2006.</p> <p>When the first segment of the $60 billion project was launched in 1998, the completion date was in 2004. Later, as Russia fell behind on a key module, the date was moved to 2005. This time, the delay is not linked to problems on the ground, said Bob Cabana, the station program's manager for international operations. Instead, Nasa has begun to rethink its entire approach to the construction project some 240 miles above Earth. </p> <p>The new schedule allows crews of US astronauts and Russian cosmonauts, who will live aboard the orbiting outpost, to begin scientific research almost as soon as the first crew, Expedition One, reaches the station later this year. </p> <p>But the new launch schedule, which targets April 2005 for the ribbon cutting, reflects Nasa's fading confidence in the ability of the United States and Russia to complete the next 35 assembly missions on a schedule that would require a launch every month or so. </p> <p>The new schedule, approved by Nasa's partners in Russia, Europe, Canada and Japan last month, \"spreads it out a little,\" Cabana said. \"I think its a much more realistic schedule.\" </p> <p>At the same time, Russian space officials are making clear that their funding problems have not abated. The Russian programme is funded through March, a four-launch schedule that includes the first three-member Expedition One crew aboard a Soyuz spacecraft. However, funding beyond that is cloudy. </p> <p>Russia's Ministry of Finance has not released funding for the following year, with nine Russian launches scheduled, and space officials there expect they will have to fight for their money. </p> <p>\"It's a very ugly process, really,\" said Mikhail Sinelshikov, the Russian Space Agency's chief of piloted programmes. \"We've been living under such circumstances for a long time.\" </p> <p>Nasa's space station programme manager, Tommy Holloway, was optimistic, saying \"I really expect they'll find the money and be able to fulfil their obligations.\" </p> <p>But US space officials say the decision to extend the construction period has less to do with Russia's problems than with lessons learned from their one-time competitors, who have been successfully flying space stations since the 1970s. </p> <p>Nasa's work ethic is largely based on missions designed to last no more than a week or two, something perfected during the Apollo moon programme and reinforced by almost 20 years of shuttle flights. </p> <p>This \"sprinter's mentality,\" as space officials have referred to it, has led to planning where every five-minute increment of an astronaut's time in space is planned months in advance. Although that may work for an 11-day shuttle mission, Nasa has begun to see advantages in the \"marathon\" approach of the Russians. </p> <p>\"It's our nature to want to plan things six months in advance, while the Russians will take a look at it and say, 'That is feasible. We know that that can be done. We'll wait until we're a month out to take a serious look at it and we won't nail down the final plan until a week ahead of time,'\" said Jim Van Laak, a senior space-station manager for Nasa. </p> <p>\"That's not in Nasa's current view of how we do business. It's something we're either going to have to adopt of make a compromise toward,\" he said. </p> <p>One reason is the strain on crews on the ground and in orbit. Nasa likes to put astronauts to work almost the minute rocket engines stop firing. The Russians like to give space-station crews several days to recover from their launch and become acclimated to their new environment before starting full work days. </p> <p>Representatives for all space-station partners were at the Kennedy Space Centre on Wednesday in advance of Friday's launch of the space shuttle Atlantis. Nasa said Atlantis was in good shape after the launch pad was hit by lightning Tuesday night. </p> <p>If all goes as planned, this supply and assembly run will begin what Nasa calls the most ambitious 12-month period in the history of human space flight. </p> <p>Between them, the Russians and Americans will try to launch a dozen or more missions. At the end of that time, the station should be the largest manufactured structure ever to fly in space and one of the brightest objects in the evening sky.</p>",

Very much like that scene, I happened to walk in, I was dressed as a Viking and that scene took place. </p> <p>Q1: Did they let him out of the house?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> No, that's what happened, no he refused to go out. He was extremely stubborn; the same thing with Frank Sinatra not getting out of the car is also my cousin Eddie as well. It is true.

But that is him. </p> <p><strong>Q2</strong>: What was the studio's reaction to Toys, and did they interfere?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> No, they didn't interfere with that film because it was so out there, there was really nothing, y'know.</p> <p>Q2: Did they understand it?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> No, but to be honest with you, most critics didn't understand it either. I probably got criticised for that film more than for any other film I've done in my life. To the point I'm going, \"What did I do?\" It was a surrealistic kind of comedy and it was peculiar and people were living in a pop-out house and it dealt with certain kind of issues and it was an odd-ball kind of film in a way, but a better example would be Rain Man. So Rain Man, for instance, they would say, \"Listen\" and here's the way they would deal with it, \"cause they didn't like the ending but they didn't say it that way and they say, \"Listen, so if you ever feel like you wanna re-shoot some things at the end, y'know, feel free to do that\". I just tell you one quick story, we did have a screening for an audience, where they fill out the cards and they say, \"What do you think of the ending?\" I'll always remember one card that said, \"What do you think of the ending?\" and the person wrote in: \"I was hoping the little guy would snap out of it.'</p> <p><strong>Q3:</strong> The ending of The Natural had a certain tacked on feeling. Was that intentional?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> Yes it was, because it was a fable, because of the way the movie progressed it seemed like a logical conclusion. It's an interesting thing because y'know, Bernard Malamud who wrote it had a different ending. It was a much darker ending. We talked about the difference between the book and the film. The film goes a different way than [novelist] Malamud went. On the other hand, I don't think we could have gotten away with Malamud's ending which was he strikes out and he's accused of throwing the game and it ends with \"Say it ain't so Joe, say it ain't so\". It's sort of something where we wouldn't get away with either. And probably it becomes one of the screenwriter going his direction which was into this kind of, I guess, sort of, full fantasy type of work that seemed consistent to that, in my mind. At one time we almost thought that we would just have him swing and it would go, \"Strike three\" and the to black, and that would be the ending. Just to see what the reaction of the studio would have been, which would probably have been to pass out. That Robert Redford strikes out at the end and it just goes to black. . . it seemed consistent to what we were doing.</p> <p><strong>Q4:</strong> Why did you part company after something like 12 years of working with Mark Johnson as your producer?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> Well, I think because Mark wanted to do a number of films at that point and I was doing certain things. There comes a point because we started out together, that we have different kinds of ambitions. He wanted to pursue other pieces and so at that point in time it seemed the right thing to do. He's gone on to do other things and I've obviously done other things. Although we've just worked this past year on a piece called An Everlasting Piece, which I shot in Ireland. It was a very small movie and it takes place in Belfast in the 80s. It was written by someone who grew up in Belfast and it's a comedy that deals with a couple of wig salesmen. They sell hairpieces. One's Catholic and one's Protestant and they kind of deal with one another set against the backdrop of the 80s in Belfast. So we worked on that one together, y'know, so we still obviously stay in contact.</p> <p><strong>AW:</strong> Do you enjoy being a producer yourself? Because obviously that's something that you've become, I mean apart from your own movies with Baltimore Pictures and now Baltimore Spring Creek Pictures, you've got a kind of roster of productions which aren't necessarily yours.</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> Well there's two different things to it. I mean, one, there are some films that are personal to me that I want to do; there are other ideas that come along and I say, \"I'd like to see that\" and if I can help to facilitate that in some fashion then I would love to do that. So y'know, Analyse This, this past year was out of our company and Perfect Storm was out of our company and Quiz Show was out of our company and some things I'm probably forgetting. Some things are just nice, you say, \"I'd like to see that happen\" and then there are those that I feel more emotionally connected to.</p> <p><strong>Q5:</strong> I want to ask about An Everlasting Piece - why did you get involved with something that seems to be out of the normal course of your film-making, your milieu?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> Well Mark Johnson gave me the script and I thought it was interesting and he said, \"What about directing?\" I said, \"I don't know, I'm not sure that maybe it shouldn't be an Irish director who does it\" But I said, \"I'll tell you what I'll do, why don't we get some Irish actors together and have a reading of the script and I'll see if what I think is humorous and where I think things work, work. Then if I feel comfortable enough, then I'll do that.\" And we had a reading of it and I thought all the things that were humorous and where the drama was actually, I was very comfortable with and so I agreed to do it. When I went to Belfast, I was sort of surprised because it reminds me of Baltimore! It has the row houses, it's very similar in parts to Baltimore. I was sort of shocked by it, I thought I was doing sort of the Belfast version of Tin Man. It has aspects of that, of course there is the political climate, which we don't really focus on, we really deal with the relationship of these two guys trying to sell hairpieces. It's always the odd man out because if they're in a Catholic neighbourhood then the Protestant is out, or vice versa. And it was an interesting piece because you can deal with those issues without dealing with them head-on and dealing with the comedy which is not the comedy about the troubles, it is really about the relationship between these two guys in what I might consider a much more of a human comedy, and so that's how it happened.</p> <p><strong>Q6:</strong> Do you use self-destructive characters in your personal movies, to ensure the films - because they are based in your memory - don't become too sentimental and soppy?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> Well I don't think I consciously do any one thing, I think it just becomes, when you lay it out in your head, you go down the road that seems to make sense to you, rather than saying I think I need to do this because it will counter-balance this, etc etc. I think any time you deal with certain things that take place in the past you always struggle with, especially if you're not really action-oriented and you're character-oriented, you're always going to have to deal with the aspects of what is going to be a clich\u00e9 from what we know versus what happened. But I don't try to consciously do any one thing to counter-balance what I think, y'know, someone may think or feel. I have to kind of just rely on my own instincts.</p> <p><strong>AW:</strong> I just wanted to ask you one supplementary question which is about the burlesque aspect of Liberty Heights. What made you make that such an important focus of the action - and also not just as a setting where people meet and talk, it's almost like a commentary as we go through the film, you cut to burlesque dancers throughout the film, what is the kind of importance of burlesque in Liberty Heights?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> Well it's part of the transition as well because it's the end of that. A lot of the other things are all at the beginning and that's really the end of that. It was also the end of, in a sense, the ultimate irony that the numbers racket which ended was taken over by the government and that became the big lotteries that we had and a lot of those people were arrested - the government took for being \"Well that's a good idea, we'll do it instead\". I thought the setting of things that are ending and things that are beginning and also my father, a lot of his friends had been involved on the block where they had the clubs etc and they always had sort of shady kind of, y'know, things that went on. It wasn't like Mafioso stuff, but there were these questionable things. Like a mother says at one point, \"Because it's illegal, but it's not so bad\". I thought y'know, it is a true story, about the guy hitting the money, but would have busted them. In the context of it all, I thought it was the right texture for it.</p> <p><strong>Q7:</strong> Why did you set the black young girl in the school [in Liberty Heights]. I ask this because I grew up in Baltimore, and I just don't think that she is credible.</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> First of all, it was real. Actually I am surprised that you would ask that question, because there were, in my year, three blacks. All of them were middle class. Because Forest Park was a middle class section, the middle class blacks went to the middle class school. Rather than the poor blacks who would still be down at Dunbar etc and that part of town. And it wasn't until bussing began to move people from one neighbourhood to another. But at that point in time, it would definitely be a middle class black individual that would be going to Forest Park.</p> <p>Q7: You have it set in '54?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> Yes, in '54, the beginning of the desegregation of the school system. I actually took a real situation and she actually, her father was a doctor. So I just took the thing that I knew about.</p> <p><strong>Q8:</strong> How do you feel about the lack of depiction of Jewish culture in British television and film?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> I don't know enough about the situation here to really comment on it because I'm not familiar with the shows on television because we wouldn't have seen them in the States, so I really don't know enough to give you a good answer.</p> <p><strong>Q9:</strong> Why did you do Disclosure?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> I thought it was interesting to me to deal with the issue of sexual harassment because it became like, the corporation's paranoia of the 80s versus what the corporation's stories in the past might have been in terms of take-overs and whatever, power plays and all that kind of stuff. What I was intrigued by was the politics of that, and I was also intrigued by whether or not you can create suspense, hold the audience together, for two hours and try to get them involved in terms of the tension of it, when in the end, no one has a gun and no one is going to shoot anybody, in the end the guy could lose his job. Just that. But yet you create a world of certain suspense and intrigue and there is no gun, there is no one coming to kill you. So I like that idea of dealing with suspense and using the sexual harassment issue to kind of play that out. So that it becomes all these glass walls, it seems so friendly and becomes a point of paranoia. That intrigued me on that respect.</p> <p><strong>Q10:</strong> Was Tom Cruise your original choice in Rain Man?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> I came into the film late. Dustin and Tom had both been signed to do the movie and four directors had been involved and all of them dropped out. Finally I had a conversation with Dustin Hoffman, who talked to me about it and he was explaining the story and I said, \"Oh that's interesting, I don't see what the big problem is\". Sydney Pollack was the last director to drop out because he couldn't figure out how to handle the story. So I came late into the process and so I took over and my big thing was to throw out all the story stuff they had. Let's just simplify it. We've got two guys in a car. I'll tell you this, because every director approaches things in a different way. Sydney Pollack said to me, and for him, ultimately, it probably wasn't the right film to do. He said, \"I don't want to do a movie about two schmucks in a car\" and I said, \"Sydney, I think that it's a good idea\" and ultimately I took out the adventure aspects of it and let's just focus on these two things. The salesman who can sell and can charm, with this individual who can't be sold, who can't be charmed and who you can't really communicate with. At some point it's going to turn back on yourself and you're gonna have to deal with yourself because there is no one else to deal with. And so that's what happened. When we went on the road to shoot it, we just kept finding other things and trying other things as we went along. So a lot of it became improvisation along the road. And to not focus on the issues of autism, because it's not a disease that can be corrected, and yet at the same time, let's not be afraid of humour, because it's also a part of it. And when I spoke to families of autistic children they could tell you stories because it's part of like, almost a pressure release. Because they have to be able to talk about it with some kind of humour, otherwise it's just so difficult for them. But not to be afraid of that as a texture to the film. So long answer to that, they were already there when I came on.</p> <p><strong>Q11:</strong> What was this thing you've got with Cadillacs?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> In many ways because it's the American dream and in these films it is part of that. You go to see the Cadillac and the American dream is there. But all is not well in America, and so in the course of the year of this film, going from rushes. . . that's the changeover from the '55 to the '56 model and the '54 to the '55.. the '56 comes out in '55 and the '55 comes out in '54 - that's the way it works - but that's the dream. So life goes on and the dream is still the American dream and yet we haven't attained that and we still struggle with things. In Tin Men, it was because every Tin Man wanted the Cadillac because that meant they were a success. So it has always been the symbol of success in America, so that I've always used it in one way or another.</p> <p>Q11: Do you have one?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> My father had one, as soon as we moved to suburbia and we had enough money, he got that Cadillac. </p> <p><strong>Q12:</strong> Would you like to make a film about the film business?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> I don't know, it would depend on what the . . . I mean I've done it in a peripheral way. . .</p> <p><strong>AW:</strong> Well, isn't Wag the Dog really a kind of a film about the movie business?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> Yes and how politics is the movie business, yes. I mean, so the movie business has crept into everything and certainly politics because it is a show. They need to do very much the same kind of way - they've taken more and more film techniques, in fact some of the candidates even work with directors about how to speak to an audience and what's the most effective way to do that, and so, yeah it does link up. The closest I came to it was this film called Jimmy Hollywood, which I don't really know if it was shown over here. Which was Joe Pesci and it was a really kind of modern Hollywood, which was run-down and derelict, and you have a guy who is really not mentally stable in many ways who dreams and aspires to be an actor, and because of circumstance where people think he is some kind of vigilante, he begins to play out a role and begins to think of himself in those terms. But not the film business, the inner workings of it, no.</p> <p><strong>Q13:</strong> What was your continuing creative involvement with Homicide after you'd actually directed the first episode and green-lit it?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> In terms of scripts, stories that we're going to do, I'd look at rough cuts, make suggestions.</p> <p><strong>Q14:</strong> When are we going to see the last of the series - when are Channel Four going to show them?</p> <p><strong>AW:</strong> We've been talking about that tonight, whether the National Film Theatre - if we can't get it on British television - whether we can get the episodes that haven't been screened in the UK. Here, as you can tell, there is a lot of enthusiasm for that, Barry.</p> <p><strong>Q15:</strong> When you shot Wag the Dog, you shot it quickly. Was it strange to sit back and see life imitating art?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> Both things, I mean we shot it very fast, we shot it in 29 days, we were supposed to shoot it in 30 but we started going so fast that we couldn't stop, y'know. And we had to do it very quickly and we did it very inexpensively, even though we had big movie stars. And then of course, obviously when events began to be close to what happened in Wag the Dog, it was shocking. To have the fact that we had a girl scout and Monica Lewinsky and they both wore berets, I mean it was. And there was a sexual act that happened in the White House and then ultimately, the bombing raid that took place, it was almost surrealistic how close it was. The ultimate irony of it, in one way and sometimes it's a little bit like, y'know you go, \"Good\". There was phenomenal reviews, except in Washington DC, and secondly the critic took us to task by saying: \"It's a stupid title for a movie, y'know, Wag the Dog\" and suddenly to turn around within six weeks to have Kissinger saying on the news \"This is not a Wag the Dog scenario\". Wag the Dog became a part of the language. And also to take task that we didn't know enough about politics because these things cannot occur and etc etc. All of these things started to occur, so I got a private joy out of that. But it is odd when you do something and how similar things are, that can happen in life. I was pretty shocked. <strong>[ <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/levinson/0913levinson4.ra\">Listen to the soundclip</a> ]</strong></p> <p><strong>Q16:</strong> I just wanted to say that Liberty Heights is wonderful - are we going to have anymore Baltimore movies?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> That's a hard question. One, I don't know if, I mean I have certain ideas and I also think it gets more difficult to do those, it gets more and more difficult to do kind of smaller, not that it's small, because it's actually fairly difficult to do those, there is over 5,000 extras and we're all over the city. Most of the things that you see don't quite exist like that. The street with all of the clubs, that doesn't exist and a lot of things had to be faked for the film. But it gets harder to do films about people. Not extraordinary people, just people. And it's harder to sell them and the marketplace gets more, kind of big event, ride films - when you read a review it's a \"real ride\". I'm still of the mind that if it's a ride, you get on the thing and you go for a ride but that the ride in a theatre has to deal with people, it has to deal with character and some of the things that I can relate to. And not that there isn't room for the some of the other things, but that you'd like to have the blend but it is getting more and more squeezed out of the market place. I mean I don't know a James Bond. That's not something I relate to on a normal basis. I can enjoy one of those movies, but I don't know a James Bond. I also like to see the things that I sort of know about, that happen in the society that we live in and the world we live in today. But it gets more and more difficult all of the time. </p> <p><strong>Q17:</strong> What the process you follow when it's not a script that you've originated, what kind of input do you have? Do you rewrite? I know in Levinson on Levinson, you talked about working with James Herbert, perhaps you could just generally talk about working with other script writers.</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> Ultimately I have to be comfortable enough with the material and with the dialogue and everything else. Sometimes I will change dialogue or work with an actor and fix things if it doesn't sound right to my ear, so you modify and change things, even on scripts that you're not considered a writer. Scenes, etc, a number of things that take place. But certainly in terms of dialogue, it has to feel comfortable enough to my ear because if it doesn't, then I keep thinking something's wrong. Sometimes it's not the performance, the dialogue sticks out as something isn't natural enough for me.</p> <p><strong>AW:</strong> At that point we have to stop, I'm afraid but we have got a lovely clip of Rain Man for you to end this evening. I'd like to thank the Guardian, Warner Brothers. Barry Levinson for giving us a wonderful new movie, Liberty Heights. I'd like most of all to thank Barry Levinson himself for being our guest this evening. </p> <p> <strong>Sound clips</strong><br> \u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/levinson/0913levinson1.ra\">On cuts that the studio wanted to make to Diner</a> (53 seconds) <br>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/levinson/0913levinson2.ra\">On his childhood</a> (1min 28) <br>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/levinson/0913levinson3.ra\">On film language and editing</a> (1min 16) <br>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/levinson/0913levinson4.ra\">Life imitating art in Wag the Dog</a> (1min 41)</p>",
  "<p> Shandwick Public Affairs has poached a senior member of Tony Blair's press office to be its new director of media relations.</p> <p>David Peel will join Shandwick this autumn to advise the company's blue-chip clients on media relations and crisis management.</p> <p>Colin Byrne, chief executive of Shandwick Public Affairs, said: \"There are few greater media relations challenges than working at the heart of modern, active government. David's appointment further strengthens our position at the cutting edge of strategic media relations, issues management and public affairs.\"</p> <p>Peel, 40, has worked in Whitehall media relations since 1992. He worked in the Departments of Environment, then Education and Employment, before joining the prime minister's press team. During his years in Whitehall he he has worked closely with senior ministers and with the prime minister's private office. </p> <p>The prime minister's press secretary, Alastair Campbell, said: \"David has been a great asset to the Downing Street press office and I have no doubt that he will put his considerable talents to very good use in the private sector.\"</p>",
  "<p>On Tuesday morning William Hague reiterated that yes, he really did drink 14 pints a day in his youth. While millions have reacted to this boast with incredulity, I believe him. In fact, I'm not convinced he ever stopped. For the latest chapter of what the Tory leader calls his \"common sense revolution\" contains the first official notification of a plan that could only have been hatched in the bottom of a bottle. The Conservatives' solution to the impositions of what they call \"a European federal superstate\" is to join an American one. </p> <p>Senior Tories, backed by the Daily Telegraph, have long been campaigning for British membership of the North American Free Trade Agreement. At first the plan was to leave the European Union. Now they seem to believe that other European nations will subscribe to their interesting variety of common sense. In their draft manifesto, published on Tuesday, the Conservatives reveal that they want to \"extend the free-trade zone across the Atlantic\". The publication is called Believing in Britain. It would be better christened Believing in America. </p> <p>Quite what the basis of this belief might be is anyone's guess. If you want to know what would happen to Britain as a member of Nafta, you need only look at Mexico. The weakest member of the original pact, Mexico has become a dumping ground for the unsavoury industrial practices Americans want to keep out of their own backyards. Under the agreement, there is nothing the Mexican government can do to stop this: while in theory its signatories are obliged to offer foreign corporations precisely the same terms as domestic ones, in practice they must give them far more. Nafta empowers companies to sue governments for the removal of regulations which might affect their profits. So US corporations have begun suits against environmental protection laws in both Mexico and Canada. </p> <p> W hen the agreement was signed in 1993, its US negotiators promised that that it would generate 200,000 new American jobs a year. Four years later, US government departments admitted that they could find only 1,500 new jobs, while 204,000 had been lost. Some people suggested that the jobs had moved to Mexico, but between 1993 and 1997 unemployment there rose by 2m, while wages fell by 29% and 28,000 small firms disappeared. What had happened was that big companies, most of them from the US, merely expanded their markets at the expense of everyone else. </p> <p>As new members of Nafta, we would not be better off than Mexico, but worse, for we would be obliged to accept the outcome of negotia tions to which we were not party. The Conservatives might moan about Maastricht, but at least we were there. </p> <p>The contradictions between this crazy plan and the rest of the Tories' draft manifesto reveal a political naivety so touching that you almost want to give the poor inebriates your vote. \"To protect the competitiveness of our haulage industry\", the Tories would \"charge foreign lorries to use our roads\". Under Nafta, whose stated purpose is to create equal conditions for domestic and foreign corporations, this would be immediately struck out. The Conservatives' commendable plan to \"return discretion to local communities, enabling them to protect their neighbourhood\" is a precise description of what Nafta prevents. Whitehall, the manifesto complains, is \"imposing an oppressive uniformity and reducing the opportunity for local initiative\". Just wait till you see what Nafta can do. </p> <p>Nor, of course, is there any way in which this plan could be reconciled to the Tories' commitment to defend our \"national sovereignty\". \"We are being guided,\" the manifesto complains, \"by people who believe that Britain cannot survive as an independent nation in a global economy and should instead become a small part of a regional bloc.\" The solution? Britain should become a still smaller part of a much bigger bloc. </p> <p>It could be argued that the Tories are simply responding to an alarming global reality: under pressure from big businesses hoping to become still bigger, trade blocs are expanding and beginning to elide, with the result that national parliaments are being forced to submit to ever more supranational laws. But by insisting that he wants to keep the pound and defend our \"independence and integrity\", William Hague creates the impression that he wants to stop all this rather than encourage it. The Conservatives have long sustained the irreconcilable beliefs that while European integration is bad, global integration is good. </p> <p>If Mr Hague really sought to defend national sovereignty, there might be something to be said for him. But, for all his subtle xenophobia, in truth he is the enemy of independence. If you want to belong to a federal superstate, vote Conservative. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:g.monbiot@zetnet.co.uk\">g.monbiot@zetnet.co.uk</a></p>",
  "A confidential report commissioned by the government into the controversial Ilisu dam project has revealed significant underestimates of the chaos and misery it would bring to tens of thousands of people. <p>Up to 78,000 Kurdish people, around three times the number originally thought, will be made homeless and landless by the British-backed scheme in Turkey, according to the report seen by the Guardian. </p> <p>The report makes clear that thousands of already extremely poor people are at risk of \"falling into greater destitution\" if the government goes ahead with its plan to make \u00a3200m of taxpayers money available to contractors Balfour Beatty to allow the dam to be built. </p> <p>Reports that the government was dropping the dam project have been formally denied by Richard Caborn, the trade minister. He was writing to protesters on behalf of the prime minister, who has been threatened with high court action because damming the Tigris would alter the flow of water to Iraq and Syria without any consultation. </p> <p>His letter reiterating the British support for the project came on August 22, four days after the report on the flawed resettlement plan was sent to the Department of Trade and Industry by Ayse Kudat, 56, who is Turkish but has most recently been the World Bank's head of social development. </p> <p>The report, leaked yesterday to the Guardian, had been kept secret even though the department said it would make documents connected with the Ilisu project public. </p> <p>The report said the dam would inundate the most fertile irrigated land in the area where landlessness and poverty was already widespread. Half of the people did not grow crops but grazed animals on pasture, worked for cash payments and relied on subsistence gardening \"to stay alive\". </p> <p>The people who were forced to move would be at high risk of falling into greater destitution, Dr Kudat said. </p> <p>Dr Kudat was employed by the export credit agencies of the UK and other European countries to report on the Turkish plans to resettle Kurds in the area to be inundated. She said some of the area was not accessible because of Turkish military operations against the Kurds, but potentially the number of people affected was between 47,000 and 78,000 - up to three times the government's original estimate. </p> <p>The government made its support for the project conditional on a proper resettlement plan but Dr Kudat noted that many similar plans round the world had failed. She said sweeping institutional reforms were required in Turkey if there was to be any hope of an Ilisu plan working. </p> <p>\"In the Turkish context, past failures have been particularly severe with respect to inadequate and inappropriate delivery of resettlement housing,\" she said. </p> <p>There had been a lack of concern for the well being of those forced to move, failure to consult them, and no monitoring of social impact. </p> <p>She said the Ilisu catchment already contained thousands of people displaced from previous projects who had not been properly settled or compensated for losing their homes. </p> <p>The coalition of environment and human rights groups opposing the dam said the report highlighted 10 serious problems with the Turkish resettlement plan which violated World Bank and OECD guidelines on financing such projects. These included Turkey's failure to provide a resettlement budget. </p> <p>Kerim Yildiz, a director of the Ilisu Dam Campaign, said: \"This report clearly indicates that the Turkish government is in no position to fulfil even the basic conditions put forward by the UK government. </p> <p>\"It provides more than enough evidence for the government to abandon this ill conceived and destructive project.\" </p> <p>A trade department spokesman confirmed that no decision had yet been made on whether the Ilisu project would be backed, but it was conditional on the resettlement plan being satisfactory.</p>",
  "<p>The boom in mobile phone text messages helped IT services group Logica offset slow trading in its previously core financial services division. </p> <p>Surging growth in its telecoms division, driven largely by the popularity of text messaging among youngsters, enabled Logica to beat analyst revenue forecasts in what it described as a \"challenging\" market environment. </p> <p>Revenues for the year to June 30 climbed 28% to \u00a3847.4m, profits before tax and exceptional items grew 54% to \u00a397.4m and earnings per share rose 43% to 17.6p. Order intake was up 40% at \u00a31bn. \"Despite a market that has been difficult to say the least we have been able to deliver a 40% rise in revenues and profits for the seventh successive year,\" said chief executive Martin Read, above. </p> <p>A combination of profit taking and concerns about the slow recovery of the financial services division af ter the Y2K spending lockdown knocked the shares back in early trading yesterday. They recovered to close off 35p at \u00a321.40. </p> <p>\"These weren't blockbuster numbers but certainly credible bearing in mind the difficult market conditions over the past 12 months,\" Deutsche Bank analyst David Rees said. </p> <p>The lack of spending on financial services shaved 19% off that division's revenues and knocked the European and North American markets heavily. \"We could do better in those markets,\" Mr Read said, warning that it could be sometime before growth returns to normal.</p>",
  "President Bill Clinton opened the millennium summit with a call to better equip the UN to halt civil wars, eradicate poverty and stop the spread of deadly diseases that know no borders. <p>\"Fifty years ago the UN was formed to 'save succeeding generations from the scourge of war'. We are that succeeding generation,\" he said. </p> <p>\"There are assembled here more people with the power to create peace than have ever gathered together in one place in the history of the world. Can we seize this moment?\" </p> <p>He told the world leaders that they had an opportunity to make a difference in trouble spots, from the Middle East to Burma. With the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, and the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, among those listening in the general assembly hall, he asked them and their allies to support a peace deal. </p> <p>\"To those who have supported the right of Israel to live in security and peace, to those who have championed the Palestinian cause these many years, let me say the time to help both sides take risks for peace is now,\" he said in his final address to the general assembly as president of the United States. </p> <p>In a gesture towards the warming relations between Washington and Tehran, the Iranian president, Mohammad Khatami, moved the time of his address forward so that Mr Clinton could hear it. Mr Khatami, who was due to speak in the afternoon, made his address on the perils of globalisation in the morning. Mr Clinton remained in the general assembly to listen. </p> <p>\"Globalisation should not be utilised to open greater markets for a few or to assimilate national cultures into a uniform global one,\" he said. </p> <p>\"In one corner of the world, human beings have attained acceptable material living conditions . . . In another corner, far more populous, they are struggling with a multitude of afflictions, ranging from poverty, ignorance and exclusion to undemocratic rulers who are often subservient to major powers.\" </p> <p>While several delegates decried the widening economic gap between rich and poor countries, Mr Clinton said the world had never seen greater freedom, prosperity or opportunities than existed today. </p> <p>But he acknowledged that the US and other countries must do more to halt the spread of poverty and the increase in civil wars, which have killed more than 5m since the end of the cold war. </p> <p>\"We must find ways to protect people as well as borders,\" he said. \"Let us equip the United Nations to do what we ask.\"</p>",
  "The fundamental conflict between the jealously guarded sovereign powers of nation states and the constantly evolving but as ever ill-defined supranational role of the United Nations overshadows this week's New York millennium summit. In theory, more than 150 heads of government have come together to tackle global problems of poverty, education, democracy and human rights. In practice, the implementation of any resulting initiatives will be subject to the test of national self-interest, applied 150 times over. And as always, any and all subsequent (and glumly predictable) failures will be blamed not on the countries concerned but on the hapless UN itself. <p>This cynical, convenient scapegoating, this game of musical chairs in which it is Kofi Annan who is always left standing when the orchestra stops, cannot be allowed to go on. As the secretary general has made clear, the UN ultimately can achieve only that which its members wish. This reality applies with particular force to those nation states which hold permanent security council membership. Yet paradoxically, the US, the most powerful of them all, is frequently the least supportive of legitimate UN aspirations (such as the international criminal court) and the quickest to blame the UN when things go wrong. In its haughty disdain for the UN, the US congress places itself in oddly roguish alliance with states like Iraq and Serbia which repudiate the UN's authority on essentially identical grounds - the quasi-neurotic safeguarding of sovereign power. </p> <p>The UN suffers from many avoidable problems, as Mr Annan freely acknowledges. Its peacekeeping operations are frequently shambolic, its numerous agencies too often beset by bureaucracy, incompetence and pernicious patronage (perpetuated by nation state purse-hold ers). From the security council down, its proceedings lack transparency and democratic scrutiny. Its clout is potentially undermined by parallel organisations like the World Trade Organisation, the IMF and G7. But if it is to fulfil its potential as the leading, indeed only, inclusive permanent global forum, as a force for good rather than an excuse for failure, the basic, debilitating disconnection between national means and agreed international ends must be overcome. </p> <p>If that means demanding that Russia or China relinquish their veto powers and embrace a community of equals, dream on. Yet a modern trend towards the ceding or relaxing of the traditional sovereign prerogatives of nation states is already discernible. The Organisation of African Unity, for example, recently accepted the principle of intervention in a country's internal affairs. Regional economic organisations like Asean move slowly but perceptibly towards common, binding political platforms. Sovereign states recognise an ever-growing body of supranational law, conventions and treaties, governing not just trade and defence, as in the past, but human rights and environmental standards. And what else is the EU but an ever greater pooling of national sovereignty? </p> <p>Britain's proposals, tabled yesterday by Tony Blair, to expand the security council and professionalise peacekeeping, are useful but partial steps towards creating a stronger, credible UN. The logic of such measures extends much further, towards the goal of a truly democratic world body supported and empowered rather than subjugated and subverted by its elite members. If a UN did not exist, one would have to be invented. Acknowledging that by their presence, New York's 150 leading lights must cede to it the power to succeed.</p>",
  "<p>It's all that weather balloon's fault. Where would popular culture have been over the last 10 years without the infamous New Mexico UFO crash seamlessly slipping into an urban conspiracy mythology that includes everything from JFK to Nazi time-travel plots, as well as prompting the consumption of student-friendly alien blow-up dolls, T-shirts and, of course, X-Files paraphernalia? As any self-respecting alien buff knows, Roswell is the Mecca of the ET cover-up brigade, with thousands of wannabe Mulders gleefully booking a room at the Alie'inn every year in the hope of seeing some Top Secret black-budget successor to the Stealth Bomber zooming at light speed over Area 51. Roswell is an established brand name in what passes for the global counter-culture - we all want to believe - so it should come as no surprise that it's now spawned its own TV show. </p> <p>Roswell High is the latest example of fusion television, splicing two popular genres (conspiracy thrillers and teen melodrama) in a surprisingly successful way - it was probably pitched to television executives as The X-Files meets Dawson's Creek. This genetic modification trickles down from the production team, with Jason Katims (writer and executive producer) having worked on My So-Called Life, David Nutter (director and executive producer) coming straight from The X-Files, and Jonathan Frakes (director), better known as Riker in Star Trek: The Next Generation. </p> <p>For this mix and match strategy to work, it's essential that the elements of both genres sit comfortably together . In the same way that Buffy is currently worrying about which college to go to, as well as dealing with the Mayor's impending plans for an occult Armageddon, Roswell High understands that the characters can't hide from the Men In Black without also hiding from teachers when they've skipped their geometry classes. The success of the show comes in the way it plays the two genres off each other. </p> <p>In tonight's opening episode, Liz Parker (Shiri Appleby) is accidentally shot while waiting tables in the local Crashdown Cafe. As she's clearly being established as a major character, there's no way we're going to see her die in the pilot, so in steps classmate Max Evans (Jason Behr) with his entirely useful alien powers, healing her in an instant after a quick laying-on of his suspiciously human-looking hands. Unfortunately for him she sees the whole thing, and wants some answers - opening up a whole can of interstellar worms. </p> <p>As the actual Roswell incident took place in 1947, their high school age has to be explained away first: Max and his fellow extraterrestrial biological entities (sister Isabel and moody friend Michael Guerin) are the surviving descendants from the original crash victims, and were put in incubators and then adopted by unsuspecting parents in Roswell after they emerged as fully formed five-year-olds sometime in the 80s. </p> <p>They've been living undercover ever since, laughing along with all the alien jokes that make up daily life in UFO Central, all the while worrying that they're about to be exposed and experimented on. The trio have formed a lifelong pact to keep their otherworldly relations a secret - and now they have to deal with trusting someone else. But, as with most secrets in high school, it's all too much for Liz to handle on her own, and she soon blabs everything to her best friend Maria (Majandra Delfino). So that they can pass notes to each other in class about their new Major Crisis, they dub the trio \"Czechoslovakians\" (no doubt an alien-enough sounding country from the perspective of the notoriously geographically challenged US teens) and happily throw themselves into fighting the powers that be (the local sheriff, who's convinced that something is Going On) with all the Scoobytastic gusto of Mulder's Lone Gunmen. </p> <p>At the same time, as Liz confesses to her diary, it's just as exciting for her that the previously unassailable Max is now talking to her as it is that she's found out that life on other planets really exists. His dreamy good looks are as important - if not more - to her as his alien biology (though she never quite seems to come to terms with the concept that the two might be mutually exclusive when it comes to physical compatibility). </p> <p>TV drama thrives on providing legitimate reasons to put characters in jeopardy week after week - that's why so many are set in police stations or hospitals. With Roswell High, the writers have made their lives easier by giving themselves two highly potent strands of tension to play with. What better reason to mistrust society and to be in constant peril than to be an alien, stranded light years from your own planet with no real understanding of how you got here, or how to get back (these kids don't have the number to phone home)? And, at the same time, what better place for these unwitting visitors to be hiding in than a high school? Teenagers have never needed to be aliens to feel alienated. </p> <p>\u0095 Roswell High, tonight, 6pm, BBC2</p>",
  "\u0095We welcome Barbara Roche's decision to take a serious look at immigration (Skills shortage prompts immigration rethink, September 4). It is long overdue. Few would disagree that migrants of all kinds can make a significant contribution to our economy and society. One thing the government could usefully do is to examine what needs to be done to make the best use of the skills and experiences of refugees and asylum seekers already in the UK. <p>Whereas it takes at least seven years and \u00a3200,000 to train a doctor from scratch, a refugee doctor can be prepared and converted to practice in the UK in months at a cost of \u00a33,000. For the sake of the health service and for refugee doctors, of whom there are 1,000 in London alone, the government needs to examine ways in which it can ensure these desperately needed skills are not wasted. </p> <p><b> Nick Hardwick</b> <br> Refugee Council </p> <p>\u0095Francis Wheen's diatribe (Babs' split personality, G2, September 6) against government immigration policy unfortunately laboured under a fundamental misunderstanding of the distinction between asylum and migration. </p> <p>Like the UNHCR, the government believes that the asylum system should not be used for economic purposes. It exists to protect people who are fleeing persecution under the UN convention, whatever their skills and qualifications. Economic value does not come into it and nor should it. </p> <p>The government does believe, however, that there should be an open debate about the role managed migration can play in helping the UK compete in a global market place.

  "<p>Tony Blair warned Bill Clinton last night that the US risked pushing the world into a trade war as he sought to save Scotland's cashmere industry from the threat of tit for tat sanctions which threaten thousands of jobs. </p> <p>The prime minister was last night holding urgent talks with Mr Clinton in New York in a last ditch attempt to prevent an escalation in the US-EU trade war. </p> <p>Washington and Brussels are at odds over EU rules for imports of bananas and hormone treated beef, which the US says discriminates against its producers, and over the payment of billion-dollar subsidies to US exporters. </p> <p> Britain is furious that despite its support for the US maintaining its Foreign Sales Corporation regime, cashmere has been added to the list of goods targetted for punitive tariffs in the latest phase of the American plan to the impact of sanctions. </p> <p>With both Mr Blair and Mr Clinton attending the Millennium Summit, a first round of talks on Tuesday night resulted in the US government postponing for 24 hours plans to announce those European industries in jeopardy. </p> <p>The US Trade Representative's office was expected to publish a new hit list of European products yesterday in the daily Federal Register. The list, delayed since June, has been held up largely by UK pleas not to include cashmere among other targets such as pecorino cheese and mineral water. </p> <p>The US authorities have resorted to punitive taxation on certain luxury goods, such as Louis Vuittion handbags and truffles, after they found that the usual tariff - of 100% - did not put off consumers. The new rate of 200% will mean Louis Vuitton handbags sell in the US for $1,200. </p> <p>UK sources said that they believed the US president had the power to remove cashmere from the hit list, although they admitted he could do little to change the new regime drawn up by hardliners in Congress known as \"carousel retaliation\". </p> <p>Washington was authorised last year by the World Trade Organisation to impose more than $300m of sanctions on European Union goods after the Geneva based body which polices global trade, ruled that Europe's regime for protecting Caribbean bananas and banning US hormone treated beef was illegal. Cashmere was exempted from the original list of goods, but in May Congress directed US trade officials to rotate sanctions through a wider list of goods. </p> <p>\"Carousel retaliation is simply pandering to domestic opinion in the US,\" said Trade Secretary Stephen Byers. \"It clearly contravenes the rules of world trade. It is simply unacceptable conduct and is an example of exactly how not to resolve trade disputes.\" </p> <p>Anthony Gooch, spokesman for the EU's trade commissioner Pascal Lamy said last night: \"Carousel retaliation is throwing petrol on a fire. It inflames a situation rather than dampening it down.\" </p> <p>Senior British sources said there was real danger of an escalating cycle of retaliation in which barriers to trade were erected on both sides of the Atlantic. </p> <p>They added that it was no co-incidence that the US move came immediately after the WTO ruled for the EU in a separate dispute over billions of dollars worth of tax breaks given by Washington to boost exports by US multi-nationals. \"The Americans are upping the ante\", one said. </p> <p>Britain is concerned that sanctions would be the final blow to the Scottish textiles industry, which is heavily dependent on cashmere exports to the US. \"If sanctions are imposed, the loss of jobs will be significant\", said Tony Taylor, the chairman of Scottish Entreprise Borders. \"Europe has got to sort the problem out and sort it out quickly.\" </p> <p>Industry experts estimate that more than 4000 jobs could be lost in the Borders region as a result of sanctions.

  "Thursday night is burger night at Fisherman's Wharf. Expats in Gap khakis and Teva sandals gobble up cheeseburgers and Mexican lager. The prices are in dollars. The talk is of Brent crude and oil pipelines. You could almost be in Texas, or Louisiana, except the portions are slightly too small, the meat has been flown in from Dubai and the waitresses are talking among themselves in Azeri - a Turkish dialect that is now the official language of Azerbaijan. <p>This small country of 8m people is on the verge of celebrating its 10th year as an independent nation. It is also on the brink of an oil windfall that varies from large to stupendous, depending on who you are talking to. Azerbaijan's share of the oil reserves under the Caspian sea are estimated to be worth around $80bn, but there could be much more. Fisherman's Wharf is one of many restaurants that have sprung up to cater for the city's sizeable foreign population. It is a reminder of one of the country's deeper paradoxes that the expats in Baku tend to be oil workers or aid workers: either there to make money, or there to dole it out. </p> <p>Fisherman's Wharf itself is a misnomer. There's not a wharf or a fisherman in sight. The restaurant sits in a public park, separated from it by a narrow moat stocked with a few chubby goldfish. While the diners enjoy tequila and chicken fajitas, the Azeris sitting in the park have to make do with the simpler pleasures of Russian ice cream. The moat between the park and the restaurant is only a few feet wide, but as far as the ordinary Azeris are concerned it might as well be the Caspian sea. </p> <p>The average wage in Azerbaijan is about $40 a month, barely enough for a round of drinks at one of the expat watering holes. In spite of the oil, living standards have fallen since the country became independent from the Soviet Union in 1991. And yet, in Baku at least, it is hard to escape the evidence of the oil boom. At a Mitsubishi dealership, Azerbaijan's new elite pay cash for new four-by-fours. Rugged vehicles are prized because they can stand up to the potholed roads. Enormous mansions are going up on the outskirts of the city and the view from the public beach includes an oil platform just offshore: the new money is visible everywhere, and everywhere there is an opportunity to spend it: outlets for designer clothes, sushi bars, numberless basement dives lined with sad-eyed prostitutes from central Asia. </p> <p>There's an odd symmetry, too, about the glut of foreign investment in the oil industry. At the dawn of the 20th century, Azerbaijan produced half of the world's supply of oil. The Rothschilds and the Nobels were among those who made fortunes here. Azerbaijan has been producing oil for more than 100 years, and yet the wealth seems to have flowed out of the country without leaving much of a residue for the majority of its people. </p> <p>There are some elaborate turn-of-the-century mansions in the old city that were built with the first flush of oil money, but vast swathes of the country give no indication of the wealth it is heir to. The president of Azerbaijan, Heydar Aliyev, is fond of telling his people that the country is developing with every passing day, and they can look forward to excellent lives. But some Azeris are already sick of hearing they're going to be the new Kuwait. </p> <p>\"Five years ago, they said everything was going to be great in five years,\" says Rasul, a 20-year-old worker on Oily Rocks, a Stalin-era oil platform. This mind-boggling collection of rusty roads and oily wells stands on trestles 60 miles out to sea. There were once 120 miles of roads defying the elements at Oily Rocks, but three-quarters of them have fallen apart. Rasul told me he'd had enough, and was waiting for a visa to emigrate to the Netherlands. </p> <p>On the streets of Baku, unemployed teachers and former soldiers jostle for work sanding the parquet floors of the newly rich. Locals call them \"slave markets\". Cars pull up periodically and after a quick discussion a deal is struck and the floor sander takes his seat in the car. These people are scornful of the idea that the oil is going to bring them any benefit. \"The oil is nothing to do with us,\" one told me. \"We are slaves.\" </p> <p>I had gone to Azerbaijan to make a documentary for Channel 4 about the way globalisation is changing the country. Far from diminishing the gulf between rich and poor, the arrival of the global economy seems to have thrown it into sharper relief. On the same street corner, one man is buying a SIM card for his mobile phone, while another sits in the dust with welding equipment that looks like it might have been salvaged from the Titanic. </p> <p>Outside the oil industry, the economy in Azerbaijan is moribund. The word used most frequently in connection with the country's economy is not oil, but corruption. Azerbaijan regularly heads the lists of the world's most corrupt countries, where it jostles for the top spots with Nigeria, Indonesia and Russia. </p> <p>I had applied for an interview with President Aliyev so I could ask him directly about corruption, not really expecting anything to come of it. But he is keen to project a media-friendly image, and one Sunday afternoon, I found myself at his dacha. </p> <p>Aliyev is a dapper man of 77. He handled my questions with suave assurance. \"Naturally, there is corruption in some parts of our society. This is a common disease,\" he says as we chat in a palatial marble hall overlooking the Caspian sea. He is keen to portray himself as a good tsar, surrounded by corrupt officials. He says that even if he fired everyone who takes bribes, the people he replaced them with would also be on the take. It suits him to say so because it deflects responsibility from him: after all, he has ruled the country on and off since 1969. He is bossy and autocratic - an ill-judged intervention from an underling provoked a furious response as we were walking around the garden for the television cameras. It's hard to believe he doesn't get exactly what he wants. </p> <p>But the expats at Fisherman's Wharf have a lot of time for the president. He stays involved in the oil industry, and is rumoured to deal personally with problems. His son Ilham and brother Jalal are both vice- presidents of the state oil company, which has a stake in every barrel of oil pumped from the Caspian sea. </p> <p>From the viewpoint of Fishermen's Wharf, the main concern is the issue of succession. Aliyev is beginning to look his age and last year underwent heart surgery. The foreign oilmen wish him long life over their margaritas, because his death is likely to trigger an unseemly period of jostling at the very least, and possibly something much worse. With Iran to the south, Russia to the north, and a conflict ticking away with Armenia, Aliyev's successor will have to share his gifts for balance-of-power politics if the fledgling nation is to survive. </p> <p>What all this will mean for the foreign oil interests is still unclear. But if I was at Fishermen's Wharf, I'd think about having that burger to go. </p> <p>\u0095 Unreported World: All the President's Oil is showing tomorrow at 7.30pm on Channel 4</p>",
  "France's fuel crisis deepened yesterday as the government warned that there would be \"no further negotiations\" with the road hauliers who are continuing their blockade of oil refineries and fuel depots throughout the country. <p>With rationing, including a ban on filling jerrycans, now in force in more than 50 of France's 96 districts, there were long queues again outside the estimated 20% of petrol stations that had stocks left. </p> <p>Lionel Jospin's Socialist-led government is being increasingly criticised for its handling of the dispute, described by the Green party, which is a member of the coalition, as shortsighted. </p> <p>The latest protesters to join the hauliers, farmers, taxi drivers, ambulance companies and coach companies in demanding an urgent cut in French state fuel taxes were the barge owners who, along with a handful of sightseeing boats, blocked traffic on the river Seine outside the finance ministry yesterday. </p> <p>\"Like everyone else, we are being irreparably harmed by the rise in fuel prices,\" Bernard Baussart, head of the 1,000-strong independent barge-owners' association, said. </p> <p>\"This was never a secure profession and now we're seeing up to 20% of our profits disappear literally in smoke.\" </p> <p>After consulting members, the two leading road haulier's associations, FNTR and Unostra, rejected as \"wholly inadequate\" an overnight offer by the transport minister, Jean-Claude Gayssot, of a backdated 3.5 pence rebate on every litre of fuel bought this year, plus a 2.5 pence a litre refund next year - an offer worth \u00a3100m a year. </p> <p>The hauliers said they would reinforce their blockade and warned that their members were \"more determined than ever\" to see the high fuel taxes cut to a level approaching the European Union norm. Only the union TLF, representing some large haulage firms, accepted the deal. </p> <p>Mr Jospin warned that the government \"would go no further\" and that there would be no further negotiations. </p> <p>Adding to the prime minister's woes, the main agricultural union, FNSEA, whose members are helping man about 50 of the 85 barricades maintained around refineries and depots for the past three days, said it wanted farmers to be exempted altogether from state fuel taxes. </p> <p>Ambulance and coach companies staged go-slows on main roads around several cities, including Paris, while the main taxi-driver's union announced a national day of action today. </p> <p>Fuel shortages began to bite at France's regional airports yesterday. Several planes flying into Lyon - including three international flights - were diverted to other airports because refuelling could not be guaranteed. </p> <p>Commentators, even on the left, said the government had exacerbated the crisis by trying to buy protesters off one by one rather than tackling the underlying problem. </p> <p>The escalating protests, which appear to have caught the Socialist party off guard, brought tension with its Green party colleagues. </p> <p>The Green party spokesman, Denis Baupin, accused the government of \"waiting until things degenerated and reacting, as usual, in the heat of the moment, offering concessions which run counter to the general interest\". </p> <p>The vice-president of the employers federation, Denis Kessler said: \"We have always considered it abnormal that most problems in our country degenerate into a show of force.\" </p> <p>\"Everyone tends to turn with their problems to the state, which is happy with that situation because it gets a lead role.\"</p>",
  "<p>Sir Ian Prosser, the chairman and chief executive of Bass, is to split his boardroom roles, handing over day-to-day management of the leisure conglomerate to pubs boss Tim Clarke. </p> <p>Mr Clarke, 43, fought off competition from finance director Richard North to become chief executive. He will take on the job from the beginning of next month. </p> <p>A former analyst at stockbroker Panmure Gordon, Mr Clarke joined Bass ten years ago and has overseen the growth of retail brands such as All Bar One, Edwards and Browns. </p> <p>He said: \"I'm pretty excited about it. We have an enormous amount to work on - I'm very much a front-line orientated manager and I shall be spending a great deal of time out and about in the different businesses.\" </p> <p>Mr Clarke claims his favourite tipple is draught Bass. He is a regular drinker at the company's White Horse pub in Parson's Green, south-west London. </p> <p>The change is significant for Bass's board - Sir Ian, 57, has a reputation as an autocratic manager and has held both the top jobs since 1987. He will remain executive chairman, responsible for the group's strategic direction, but he was winding down his role in preparation for the company's usual retirement age of 60. </p> <p>Sir Ian said: \"This is an evolutionary change.

  "<p>'People have always eaten people. What else is there to eat? If the Juju had meant us not to eat people, he wouldn't have made us of meat!\" So explains the exasperated father to his idealistic son in Michael Flanders and Donald Swann's revue skit from the 1950s, The Reluctant Cannibal. The teenage self-righteousness of the son (\"Eating People is Wrong!\" is his insistent protest) contrasts with the world-weariness of the father, at a loss to explain his son's sudden extremism (\"To think, he used to be a regular anthropha-guy\") while maintaining his station in the tribe (\"Me! Chief Assistant to the Assistant Chief!\"). The appeal of Flanders and Swann's satire lies in its portrayal of cannibalism as something that only na\u00efve teenagers might find totally abhorrent - global capitalism, say - when to jaded grown-ups it is just the way of the world. </p> <p>The irony is that to many people throughout history, cannibalism was the way of the world. Contemporary western horror of eating people could be an aberration, and has a lot to answer for in the world of anthropology, which is a western creation. Evidence for cannibalism abounds - even if circumstantial - both from the modern world and throughout history, but academic anthropology has found itself in a funk of denial. This explains why Richard A Marlar of the University of Colorado School of Medicine in Denver and his colleagues have gone to great lengths to substantiate a case of cannibalism from the western United States. </p> <p>Writing in today's Nature, Marlar and colleagues examine what happened at an archaeological site called Cowboy Wash, in southwestern Colorado when, sometime around AD 1150, a small settlement was suddenly abandoned. At around the time of the desertion of Cowboy Wash, seven people of various ages and both sexes were killed, dismembered and cooked. Signs of butchery are evident, and traces of human blood remain on implements found in the remains of the houses, even after 850 years. Cooking pots contain traces of human myoglobin, a protein only found in skeletal and heart muscle - in other words, meat. The researchers have published many of these findings in report after voluminous report, alleging that they have stumbled on nothing less than a cannibal feast - to deluges of denial. Signs of butchery, even cookery, do not necessarily mean human ingestion, claim critics. </p> <p>The researchers provide the clincher in their Nature report. The evidence that challenges the scepticism is humble enough: just before leaving, one of the diners at the grisly occasion left a small deposit on the cooling hearth. This coprolite ( the technical term for palaeo-poo) has yielded much to modern scrutiny. First, it is completely devoid of plant matter, including the corn and other plants that the Anasazi Pueblo people of the region lived on. The pooper had not eaten any plant matter for more than a day: he or she would have eaten meat, exclusively. But what meat? </p> <p>Biochemistry reveals traces, again, of human myoglobin, suggesting that the depositor had just enjoyed a cannibal repast. The myoglobin was human - it did not come from any conceivable animal that might have been munched instead. Even this may not be conclusive, for feces may contain cells sloughed from the diner's intestine, and even quantities of blood. The researchers show that myoglobin is not found in intestinal wall cells, and it is absent from blood - this was demonstrated by analysis of the bloody stools of modern volunteers. </p> <p>Modern abhorrence may have driven cannibalism underground. For almost 40 years, Jared Diamond of the University of California, Los Angeles, has travelled the remote forests and mountains of New Guinea, a place where cannibalism was customary in some areas until recently - yet he has never personally witnessed it. He thinks that it is the expressed dislike of cannibalism by westerners that has made it so hard to prove. When colonial administrators in newly conquered countries outlaw the practice at the merest rumour, first-hand evidence by dispassionate outsiders will naturally be hard to come by. \"Would you invite someone to watch you doing something if it would get you arrested?\" asks Diamond in a commentary in Nature. Official disapproval aside, cannibalism is often a ritual to which outsiders are unwelcome. </p> <p>Considered globally, cannibalism should be less a moral issue than one of custom. I like Marmite, but then I have been raised on the stuff. I have yet to meet an American who can stand it. There is a place where people regularly eat minced, raw flesh with raw eggs broken on top (it's called Belgium). And there are other places in which deep-fried locusts are quite the thing. In parts of New Guinea, and in the Old West, eating people could have been as natural as fish and chips on a Friday night - only prejudice prevents us from admitting it. Could it be that we're afraid of being eaten ourselves? As Flanders and Swann's cannibal father asserts menacingly, \"they'll eat you even if they can't digest your opinions.\" </p> <p> \u0095 Henry Gee is a senior editor of Nature and author of Deep Time (Fourth Estate)</p>",

A great experience also needs to be immersive, like playing computer games or talking to a lover over dinner. </p> <p><strong> What are your favourite sites? </strong> <a href=\"http://web2.si.edu/revealingthings/\" target=\"_new\">The Smithsonian Institution</a> has found a special way of ordering an online exhibition and of enabling visitors to find new routes. The navigation mechanism was a real \"a-ha\" experience for me. </p> <p>I'm also very impressed by the START Natural Language Question Answering System at <a href=\"http://www.ai.mit.edu/projects/infolab/\">MIT MediaLab</a>. I think that Amazon is still pretty wonderful. You order books. They arrive. But have a look at the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com\">American site</a>, to see how they're enabling users to add value in simpler ways than just submitting reviews. This passes my 'coral reef' test - allowing tiny amounts of added value to accrete into something very impressive. </p> <p><strong> What would you do if you could do anything? </strong> As long as I can carry on learning and doing something I believe to be worthwhile, I'm happy to be where I am. But I do find the commercial world rather tempting. </p>"
