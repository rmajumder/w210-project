  "<p>Does it matter who owns London's stock exchange? In recent years Britain has seen a number of what used to be regarded as key industries, including motor manufacturing and computers, taken over by overseas companies. </p> <p>People quite naturally feel a bit queasy when they hear of yet another British institution - this time the London Stock Exchange (LSE) - passing into foreign hands. But queasiness is not by itself enough to block a chain of events that seems to have gathered unstoppable momentum. The story so far is that the plans of the London and German bourses to merge (as a prelude to a global alliance involving others) have been thrown into disarray by what is regarded in the City as a cheeky takeover bid for the LSE from the upwardly mobile Swedish company, OM. Yesterday, the German bourse responded by inviting OM to drop its own \u00a3808m bid in order to join the Anglo-German project as another partner. Whatever emerges from all this, one thing is certain: the LSE will never be the same again. </p> <p>It can hardly complain. It voluntarily demutualised, thereby creating the possibility of a takeover bid. And, in any case, an institution whose raison d' etre is that a free market in shares leads to the maximum economic efficiency can hardly object if the process leads to foreign ownership. That is what happened after Big Bang in the mid-80s, when Mrs Thatcher made a bonfire of the City's restrictive practices. The result was that foreign companies snapped up the City's historic institutions, so that today there are virtually no large domestically owned investment banks.</p> <p> But because overseas financial companies were attracted to London, a huge number of new jobs were created in the south-east which would not otherwise have existed. The Japanese dubbed this \"Wimbledonisation\" - after the tennis club, not the football team - because the UK gained considerable economic benefits from staging the event even though most of the players were foreign. The LSE is a relatively small company (the bid values it at less than a quarter of the market capitalisation of Freeserve, the internet start-up) and whoever wins it will still be subject to regulators appointed by the government. If there is a \"national interest\" at stake here, it is simply to get the most efficient, cost-effective stock market possible so as to maintain and expand the existing customer base. If customers are dissatisfied they will take their shares to alternative bourses or, if they are big enough, trade among themselves. A series of technical problems (including the closure of trading earlier this year) has not given the LSE a reputation for managing technological change well. Maybe OM could bring a sharper technical edge. </p> <p>A pan-global stock exchange may produce economies of scale but it will also bring with it the dangers attached to monopolies, like keeping prices higher than they should be. In these days of electronic share trading, you do not necessarily need a global umbrella to succeed on a world scale, especially since you are merely trading share certificates. It must also be remembered that foreign take-overs of British assets always attract more publicity than when UK companies and individuals buy assets abroad. Last year, the UK spent \u00a3125.3bn in direct investment abroad, compared with inward investment of only \u00a353.3bn. In the first quarter of this year direct investment abroad - at \u00a3125.25m - had already matched that for the whole of last year, compared with only \u00a39.8bn of direct inward investment. So we are hardly in a position to complain.</p>",
  "<p>Dr George Kassianos, GP, author of Immunisation, Childhood and Travel Health </p> <p> The Department of Health should be applauded for its vision. Since the meningitis C vaccine was launched, cases in 15- to 17-year-olds have fallen by 77% and in babies by 73%. We live in a global village and new bacteria are constantly entering the country and putting people at risk, so at three months, babies are immunised against diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, polio, haemophilus influenzae B and meningitis C, and at 13 months receive MMR. With all drugs there's a risk of side effects but these are the safest on the planet. <strong>Verdict: Yes </strong></p> <p><strong> Rachel Jones</strong>, National Meningitis Trust </p> <p> We are very much pro the vaccination because we see the devastating effects of this disease. We gave \u00a360,000 towards the clinical trials. More than 15m people in Britain have been vaccinated and 16,000 have reported reactions - mostly fairly minimal and temporary, such as headaches or drowsiness - which is not as frightening as it at first seems. Before the vaccine was available there were around 150 deaths a year from 15,000 cases of the disease. Survivors may be left with brain damage, deafness and limb loss. It is the biggest infectious killer of children under five. <strong> Verdict: Yes </strong></p> <p><strong> David Salisbury</strong>, head of immunisation programme, Department of Health </p> <p> Britain has the highest attack rate so we worked with the manufacturers to develop the vaccine. The Department of Health has nothing to gain in cutting corners and only introduced the jab when we had proved it to be completely safe. The vaccine was tested on 20,000 children, with a five-year follow-up period. Around 7,000 children have reported reactions but on most report cards, more than one symptom is listed, such as nausea and vomiting, and these lists (of fairly standard and short-term symptoms) give the 16,000 total. <strong> Verdict: No </strong> </p> <p><strong> Jackie Fletcher</strong>, jabs group for parents of vaccine-damaged children </p> <p>We're concerned that there haven't been enough long-term safety trials and that there will be a cover-up. Britain was the first European country to introduce the jab, 12 months earlier than first planned. With the MMR the safety trials only lasted 21 days, which wasn't enough. I've met hundreds of mothers whose children were fine up until the vaccination and afterwards their lives changed dramatically. The Department of Health is blas\u00e9 about rolling out new procedures too fast on young babies whose immune systems are barely developed. <strong>Verdict: No </strong></p> <p> <strong> Tracey Lindley</strong>, mother of Paul, 14, Chloe, 3 1/2, and Jodie, 18 months </p> <p>Jodie, a happy, good-tempered baby, had the meningitis and MMR vaccines together. Within days she was covered in spots and a week later there was excessive screaming, vomiting and diarrhoea. She was biting her fists, thrashing her head around and twitching in her sleep. A hospital doctor said it was likely to be a reaction to the jabs but there was no way of knowing which one. I was told to bring her back for tests but, months later, we still haven't been able to see the same doctor, and the others have been dismissive of the seriousness of Jodie's condition. <strong> Verdict: No </strong></p> <p> <strong> Andrea Killen</strong>, mother of William, 2, and Tess, 3 1/2 months </p> <p> I had both my children vaccinated for meningitis and before last weekend's news reports hadn't heard anything negative about it. But I'm more scared of my children contracting the disease than reacting to the jab. I don't know anyone whose children have reacted to the meningitis C jab and it had no visible effect on William and Tess. They haven't had MMR yet as it's too potent for such small children when administered in one hit and I don't think it's worth the risk. My children will be having MMR broken up, although you have to go private to do it like that. Verdict: No</p>",

  "<p>When I wrote the book Earth in the Balance in 1991, terms like \"global warming\" and \"greenhouse gases\" seemed exotic, unfamiliar, and unimportant to the lives of ordinary Americans. That has changed dramatically - except for those who still want to pretend that no one cares. There is a powerful awareness of the danger, and a widespread determination that we must not and will not leave our grandchildren a ravaged planet ringed with a thickening layer of carbon dioxide concentrations. So we have to strengthen, not weaken, environmental protection across the board, from global warming to stabilising world population. </p> <p>Last November, under pressure from utility lobbies, the majority in Congress sought to write dozens of loopholes into the Clean Air Act, weakening enforcement of the law against old and dirty power plants. Instead, we need tough standards for soot and smog, with reasonable flexibility but a real timetable for implementation. In the Environment Decade, polluters should pay to clean up the pollution they've created rather than impose the burden on taxpayers. It was President Kennedy who, in speaking of a safer world, reminded us that \"we all breathe the same air\" - and if \"we all cherish our children's future,\" then we have an obligation to make it safe to breathe that air. </p> <p>As we realise and explore the interconnectedness of all the global environment problems we face - as we increasingly understand that they are not separate issues but interlocking strands in the rich fabric of the ecosystem - lots of snippets of data, including measurements of Arctic ice, counts of lost species, urban pollution measurements, and satellite records of sea surface temperatures, among others, help us put together an integrated picture of multiple stresses on the environment. We are coming to see that the solutions are not isolated either - that one depends on and reinforces the other. For example, reducing greenhouse gases will also reduce traditional air pollutants, and an effort to eliminate smog also inevitably limits carbon emissions. We have to move forward on all fronts at once. </p> <p>Saving the environment involves more than one policy, one presidency, one nation, or the work of one generation. The task is as small as the decision each of us can make to recycle or buy energy-efficient products, and as great as the imperative facing all the countries of the earth to limit carbon emissions, save rain forests, and repair the ozone layer - policies that in the end can be accomplished only on a global basis. One of our greatest hopes is young people, those who will inherit the earth and the challenge of restoring its balance - the ones who will live long enough to know surely whether this peaceful battle for the planet is finally being won. </p> <p>Today, our Global Learning and Observations for the Environment programme (Globe) has become history's largest environmental education programme for children in school. As vice president, I have fought for and won funding for Globe as one of the last small items to be approved each year in the federal budget. It is a beginning - in a sense, a pilot programme - that in the decade ahead must lead to universal environmental education. Globe is a pioneering effort to create a feedback loop that will bring the data that describe the evolving condition of the earth within the conscious authority of young citizens as well as scientists. </p> <p>In the decade to come, we have to find ways to secure a truly livable planet where 10bn people will live. In 1900, people had no idea how the earth might sustain the 6bn people we have now. Meeting that challenge evoked amazing technological advances and unprecedented environmental dangers. Our challenge now, which requires the education of us all and the raising of our collective awareness on a global basis, is to restore and save the earth even as we add still more members to the human family. This will not be easy or simple; there will be setbacks, and fierce resistance from those who profit from pollution. We will have to make new policies, develop new technologies, and think outside the conventional boxes. But the effort we are making is both a great challenge and a great adventure. It is nothing less than a commitment, for the second time in human history, to find and shape a new world. </p> <p>As I go back over what I wrote in Earth in the Balance and reflect on the progress we have made since it was first published, I can reaffirm that even though our environmental challenges are vast, we can meet them. We know that the crisis was made by our human carelessness, and it can and must be solved by our human initiative. The 20th century was many things, good and bad, but it was for much of its course a century of pollution. Since the 60s and the first Earth Day, in 1970, we have made some remarkable gains. Especially in the last seven years, we have laid the foundations to make the first decade of the 21st century the Environment Decade, for America and for the world. The agenda for that decade, discussed in this foreword and prefigured in these pages in 1992, is practical, essential, and fundamental. It will help the economy, not hurt it. And it can truly save the earth as we know it. </p> <p>This was my conclusion when this book was first published: \"We can believe in that future and work to achieve it and preserve it, or we can whirl blindly on, behaving as if one day there will be no children to inherit our legacy.\" The choice is ours; the Environment Decade is within our reach; the earth is in the balance.</p> <p>\u0095 This is an edited extract of a new foreword to Al Gore's Earth in the Balance, published by Earthscan on September 14, (\u00a312.95)</p>",
  "<p><strong> Flight of fancy</strong><br> BAA, the people who want to build Terminal 5, the monster addition to Heathrow, have just released figures showing that there were 453,000 flights in and out of the airport in the year up to July. Flight numbers were one of the most bitterly contested parts of the enquiry, and it's useful to note that BAA predicted accurately in 1995 that Heathrow would reach these levels. Not by 2000, however, but by 2020. This suggests that BAA have grossly miscalculated the growth of the airport, and that Heathrow is now full to capacity. Were T5 to be built, by BAA's figures, it would add another 30m passengers a year, or up to 150,000 flights a year. So where will these planes land? What will be their environmental affects? That's one for Inspector Roy Vandermeer QC who is thought to have finished his epic report, and could be delivering it to environment secretary John Prescott as early as November. </p> <p><strong> Mersey meeting</strong><br> Liverpool, suitably, will next week host more than 400 delegates to one of the most interesting meetings of the year - the International Ecological Restoration Conference. Delegates include the head of the New York parks department, native Americans, artists, ecologists from the Galapagos, China and Seattle. Even the fact that it coincides with the opening of the National Wildflower Centre on September 6 and that the US environmental protection agency will be present, is not enough to attract any ministers or bureaucrats from our own department of the environment or DTI.

So what does the Corporation of London, which runs it, expect to happen to the great green and wooded space now that global warming is with us? A new report predicts that hedgehogs and butterflies will flourish, that flooding and droughts will be more common, that there could be more grassland fires and a higher chance of the Turkish oak taking over from the English oak. \"A new way of thinking is required that cuts across individual economic sectors to identify appropriate adaptation strategies,\" say the authors. The same might be required of the corporation's best friends- the City bankers, who over the years have given so much money to corporations who have proceeded to lay waste to much of the world and help bring on global warming.</p>",
  "<p>Mr vice president, eight years ago when presidential candidate Bill Clinton chose you as his running mate, I was excited. I had just read your book Earth in the Balance. It inspired people like me, who care deeply about the environment. It made us believe that there was one person in high elective office who had done his homework, who had read the science, queried the experts, thought hard. You understood our concerns as no other politician did. </p> <p>You realised, back then, that if the environment doesn't work, nothing else - not the schools, not the health care system, not the economy - can work. You recognised that restoring the environment cannot be done on the margin or achieved through compromise. You called for a \"global Marshall Plan\" to make the environment \"the central organising principle of our civilisation\". You called our economic system \"partially blind\". You even had the guts to talk about ethics and faith and an \"environmentalism of the spirit\". </p> <p>So now I have a burning question for you. </p> <p>What happened? Over eight years we have seen only tepid environmental measures from you and your president. Back-pedalling. Compromise. Window-dressing. You know that as well as I do. </p> <p>Why? Where did your understanding and commitment, and courage and spirit go? If I could really ask you that question, over a beer maybe, off the record, safe from microphones, I wonder what you might answer. </p> <p>Would you say, \"Hey, I've only been vice president. I've just been biding my time, seething, waiting till I can be number one and finally move on my environmental agenda\"? </p> <p>Would you say, with devastating self-understanding: \"You know, it's a lot easier to be righteous when you're not actually in power. You wouldn't believe the pressures, from outside and from within oneself, that seduce one into caution - caution based on the insatiable desire for still more power. I've discovered, to my sorrow and shame, that I'm not up to resisting that desire. My mind and heart may be driven by principle, but there's something much stronger in me that will pitch out principle for power every single darn time\"? </p> <p>Or would you say (and this is the response I most fear): You know, no one - no one - can attain or exercise high elective office in the US without constant obedience to the money and power that put him there. Politicians are just the puppets of campaign donors. I tried for an energy tax; you saw what happened. I tried for a strong greenhouse policy; the oil, coal and car companies ran right over me. I could see that global free trade would be an environmental disaster, but the corporations said 'fight for free trade or we contribute only to Republicans'. I gave up. I'm just playing games now, trying to advance a few baby steps in good directions. They aren't enough to save the environment, but they're better than giant Republican steps in bad directions? </p> <p>Mr Gore, you can see why I and so many other Americans need to know your answer. It would tell us not only whether to vote for you, but whether to vote at all. Is our political system so corrupt that no one, no matter what his understanding or commitment, not even Ralph Nader, can do what is necessary to save the climate, the forests and soil, fish and waters? Is the cynicism of the voters who stay home completely justified? Is it time for some kind of serious revolution to take back our democracy? Or is there hope; should we give you a chance? </p> <p>Mr vice president, you're one of the few people in all the world who can tell me the answer, straight and true. </p> <p>\u0095 Professor Donella Meadows is an environmental and systems scientist who teaches at Dartmouth College US, and is co-author of The Limits to Growth (1972) and Beyond the Limits</p>",
  "<b>quizzer</b> <br> Why does Britain need an e-envoy? Isn't the point of the internet that it develops without regard to governments and national boundaries? <p><b>AlexAllan1</b><br> Let me start with quizzer's question about why we need an e-envoy at all. Tony Blair felt that the internet was at the heart of so many different policies that he needed someone who could take an overview of what was going on and what the Government needed to do. We work with Departments like the Department of Trade and Industry on the market and business framework, with Department for Education on skills and so on, and we are driving the plans to get government itself online. </p> <p>I think there's a job that needs doing here - we're certainly not short of work :-)</p> <p><b>rmarriott1</b><br> Mr Allen, how does it feel to be appointed e-envoy by a Government which is doing everything it can to destroy the UK's future in the developing new e-commerce economy? The following measures are doing real and lasting damage to the UK's competitiveness in the new e-business world: </p> <p>1. IR35 - this vindictive tax measure is driving UK IT consultants out of the country in droves. I myself start a contract in New Jersey in October, leaving the UK precisely because of IR35. My skills - distributed database systems and the integration of large databases with the web. </p> <p>2. NICs on share options - bad policy which is inhibiting investment by high tech. companies. Real examples - Veritas has halved its investment in the UK because of this measure and Cisco is rumoured to have diverted its investment plans to Eire for the same reason. </p> <p>3. RIP Bill - it is simply stupid for the UK Government to attempt to go it alone in internet regulation - far better to wait for international agreement. As a consequence of RIP, four UK based ISPs have threatened to move offshore. </p> <p>Mr Allen, I suggest you resign in protest at the Government making your job impossible.</p> <p><b>AlexAllan1</b><br> rmarriott1 - as you can imagine I get more email about those three topics than almost anything else. </p> <p>Let me take the RIP Bill first. The Government has amended the law as it went through Parliament, in response to all the points that were made. That's the essence of our Parliamentary system. I don't believe the Act is a threat to e-commerce in the UK. The Home Office has made clear that the burden on ISPs will not be excessive and the Treasury has agreed to additional funding. And the provisions on keys have been modified to make it clear that what's wanted is plain text. We do need to make sure we have laws in place to deal with paedophiles, terrorists etc. </p> <p>I'll answer on share options and IR 35 in a moment.</p> <p><b> rmarriott1</b> Obviously we need to make sure we have laws in place to deal with paedophiles, terrorists etc. My point is that internet as a global phenomenon can only be regulated at the supra-national level. Either this should be done through GATT or the WTO, or through a new body set up for the purpose. The reason ISPs are threatening to leave the UK is not because of the cost, but because of the regulatory disadvantage UK only action places them in. </p> <p><b>RealAlien</b> Mr Allan, In your response to the question re: the RIP bill, the bill itself shows how out of touch the Govt. is with IT and the Internet in general. </p> <p>Even the US has said that the powers in the RIP bill are excessive. Taking as examples our European partners, France and others have relaxed their laws, while the UK has greatly increased, are they then wrong or being complacent? In the global market, companies can and are going to countries that are seen to be reducing regulatory burdens. Sadly, the UK is increasing while our EU partners and the rest of the world are reducing theirs. The powers are not needed, and anyone with knowledge of the Internet will know that paedophiles, terrorists and criminals will not be deterred or even caught by the additional powers. It is merely an amateur attempt to regulate. </p> <p><b>AlexAllan1</b><br> rmarriott1 and RealAlien - Most other countries have or are planning provisions to require ISPs to enable emails to be intercepted: we are not alone on this. Witness the interest in the US in the FBI's use of the so-called Carnivore system to plug into ISPs and intercept email traffic. The Dutch have passed legislation on this in very similar terms to our own.</p> <p><b>JosephSW</b><br> Dear Alex, </p> <p>I run a small IT consultancy (I am not a disguised employee), and have a real opportunity to join a new e-Commerce company in this country. </p> <p>The new company has been approached by a thriving marketing company to act as its e-Commerce partner. However, because of the new IR35 measures my existing business will not be able to afford to fund the initial startup costs... the company profit is being taxed at 52% before it can be re-invested for growth. </p> <p>Is it clear to you now that IR35 is killing new e-Commerce ventures in Britain?</p> <p><b>jrharding</b><br></p> <p>Mr Allen The danger of a _genuine_ business falling foul of IR35 is real and the penalties are horrendous (personal bankruptcy and even imprisonment) How are _genuine_ small business's supposed thrive in this environment?</p> <p><b>AlexAllan1</b><br> I promised to come back on IR35 and share options, though don't expect easy solutions. </p> <p>On IR35, the Inland Revenue have made it clear that if someone meets the tests for self-employment, then they won't be affected. I know some contractor groups have sent in model contracts which seem to meet that test, though others seem to feel this won't help them. We'll have to monitor how that works out in practice. It's not a question of attacking entrepreneurship: there was some genuine abuse by people avoiding employees income tax and NICs by becoming contractors even though the reality was that they were in the same position as before. The difficult bit is stopping that without hitting people who have genuinely set up businesses.</p> <p> <b>AlexAllan1</b><br> On share options, the Treasury made some changes in the last Budget. In many circumstances we now have very similar effective rates of taxation to the US. But I know there are areas where firms feel the new rules still discourage firms from using share options as a way of giving all their employees a stake in the success of the company. Stephen Timms, the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, led a review of this and I'm sure will want to monitor how the new arrangements are working.</p> <p><b>rmarriott1</b><br> Mr Allen, thank you for your response on the IR35 issue, but you must realise that this is a dog's breakfast of a tax change. If there were real abuses to be dealt with, proper and genuine consultation with representatives of the businesses affected could have framed workable regulations. IR35 is arbitrary, unfair and discriminatory. Affected businesses are left in a state of dire uncertainty since the IR in their wisdom will not vet contracts until they have been signed. If a contract is affected by IR35 it is impossible to action it profitably. Mr Allen, are you in any way independent, or do you have to slavishly endorse every silly thing the Government does?</p> <p><b>AlexAllan1</b><br> On IR35, I'll make sure the Treasury see the comments posted here, and will discuss with them the arrangements for monitoring the impact. </p> <p><b>Nsedgwick</b><br> Alex, I think the IR35 comments cannot be expressed loudly enough. The new IR35 legislation is causing huge uncertainty and doing real damage to entrepreneurial Web/e-commerce/IT businesses such as mine. The PCG now has over 11,000 members who stand opposed to these draconian measures. In reality the number of legitimate businesses damaged by IR35 is much greater.</p> <p>Something must be done and quickly! NS. </p> <p><b>SysOut</b><br> You have used the arguments of paedophiles and terrorists to interfere with our rights and our privacy - those are the arguments of dictators - it is totally unacceptable. </p> <p>Were you to do the same with people's post - people receiving letters with envelopes which had been opened, you know very well what the reaction would be. </p> <p>This is immoral and disgusting - until now the speciality of police states. </p> <p>The fact that others (usa) do it, does not make it right or better - where is the moral backbone we expect? </p> <p><b>AlexAllan1</b><br> Sysout - I'm sure I won't convince you, but the law for some time **has** allowed the police or other agencies to get a warrant to intercept letters or phone calls. They can only do this when they have evidence that someone is engaged in crimes such as I mentioned. What the RIP Act does is extend this to other forms of communication.</p> <p><b>SysOut</b><br> Thanks Alex for your answer - I will remain, as I hope others will, vigilant of government activity in matters of data protection and privacy.. </p> <p><b>ALargeElk</b> A quick flick through http://www.parliament.uk shows that less than half of MPs can be contacted by email and only about 80 have their own homepages. Do you feel that 'to improve the democratic process', educating those at the top would be a good place to start?</p> <p><b>AlexAllan1</b><br> ALargeElk asked about MPs email addresses and home pages. I have had discussions with the Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology and with the Hansard Society about this. They are keen to encourage more MPs to use the internet and are looking at ways to help them get online. Many MPs are interested but worried about how they would handle what they fear could be a flood of email. There is quite a lot that can be done to make handling emails easier, so I hope we will start to see more MPs publishing their email addresses. I was in Rutland yesterday and the (admittedly small!) Council told me that every one of them published email addresses on their web site.</p> <p><b>dsi</b><br> What do think about using the internet as a tool for those with disabilities, enabling them to get access to information they might not otherwise be able to get?</p> <p><b>AlexAllan1</b><br> dsi - there's certainly a lot that can be and is being done to help people with disabilities take advantage of all the opportunities offered by the internet. The Government's web site guidelines have been drawn up in consultation with the RNIB and others so as to make sure that Government sites are as accessible as possible to everyone. </p> <p>It's a great tool for communication, as you say.</p> <p><b>fmk</b><br> alex - do you believe your task is being needlessly undermined by daft reporting of minor security hitches which, if they happened in the real world, wouldn't merit a para in your local paper, but because they happen in the e-world, they are front page news (ref barclays this week)?</p> <p><b>AlexAllan1</b><br> fmk - I agree that far too much is made of some of these incidents, and it does all serve to make people fearful of doing transactions online. Clearly, firms need to have proper security procedures in place so that people can be confident their personal data won't be misused. But it's far more dangerous giving your credit card to a waiter in Soho than dealing with a reputable web site using SSL for example. </p> <p><b>Paulos</b><br> How and by when will the voting process change for the electorate. If not via the internet, is there not scope for voting via the national lottery terminals - it strikes me that apathy at the ballot box could be re-addressed in this day and age. What are you recommending to your boss? </p> <p><b>AlexAllan1</b><br> Paulos - I agree we need to think imaginatively about how we can make voting easier, so that more people will participate. I was in Australia for their last election, and they have compulsory voting. I don't see that going down well here, but what was striking was the way they made voting so much easier - people could vote anywhere in their State rather than just at a single polling station. Various experiments were made during the recent local elections here and we need to analyse what worked best. There' quite a lot more to do - a rolling electoral register where you can change your registration details online is one example of a service I believe would make things easier.</p> <p><b>meethoss</b><br> At this moment in time, it is very expensive to hire a company to bring E-Commerce in to your site, and very complicated to set it up yourself. Will you be providing any sort of solution to this? </p> <p>E-Commerce is a vital part of trading and many companies are not taking advantage of it due to the complications, expenses and lack of knowledge on the subject. </p> <p><b>AlexAllan1</b><br> meethoss - it needn't be that expensive for small firms to add e-commerce to their sites. I guess I'd better not endorse individual companies, but I visited a firm in Yorkshire recently who had a really easy system for setting up and hosting e-commerce sites at a reasonable price. Local Business Links should be able to provide advice on what firms in any region are doing that.</p> <p><b>meethoss</b><br> In regard to your statement about voting on-line, I would like to point out the fact that the Internet is not the safest environment and is susceptible to attacks from \"crackers\" from all over the World. How would you ensure that the election was totally secure and that it could not be changed to influence votes for certain parties?</p> <p><b>AlexAllan1</b><br> meethoss - we'd clearly need to make absolutely sure about the security of online voting before we enabled that. I believe the technologies are or will be there, but they also need to command public acceptance. The Electoral Commission would need to be closely involved to rule out any possibility of fraud or manipulation.</p> <p><b>jrharding</b><br> Mr Allen </p> <p>Do you feel that the government is depending far too much on large consultancies for advice on IT.

The new Office of Government Commerce has a role to play in this. I'm very conscious of your point: a small consultancy firm recently explained to me that the bureaucracy and number of meetings involved in tendering for Government contracts made it impossible for them to afford to do so. We want to tap into innovative thinking in this area.</p> <p> <b>AlexAllan1</b><br> Thanks - I've got to sign off now.

  "<p>'London, UK, July 17 2000. Fifty hopeful broadband entrepreneurs aim to leave a central London hotel with projected deals worth between $1m and $10m...,\" puffs the press release from First Tuesday, the match-making club which new media types love to slate (but still be invited to, of course).</p> <p>Why should we care this time? Is it because broadband - the bandwidth technology which will enable video and film to be streamed down the phone line to our PCs and mobile phones - is the new path to profitability? The word that can throw the lifeline to floundering dot.coms and launch a flotilla of new start-ups in an otherwise suicidal market?</p> <p>Surely Channel 4's E-Millionaire Show, which culminated in a spectacular dot.bomb, was proof enough of what happens when an immature industry is over-hyped and sold to the public as lottery tickets? After its growing pains, the market has matured, as has, so we are told, First Tuesday which has announced a merger with Yazam, a first-stage investor, and is preparing for a relaunch in the autumn. </p> <p>So Thursday's event in the Park Lane Hotel was not the cattle market it used to be. The \"young pretenders\" have been put through two screening tests (only the top 10% to 15% of the 300 entrepreneurs who applied were chosen) and only half of the venture capital firms who registered have been invited. </p> <p>Lines of numbered tables are laid out with refreshments in the ballroom at which the hopefuls wait attentively for the VCs to sign their \"dance cards\". They have 10 minutes to entice their dates to a further meeting before the gong is sounded and everyone moves round one place. Almost civilised. \"Thank God. I was starting to feel too old for all of that networking stuff,\" confides David Phillips, 30-something CEO of music portal iCrunch. He is about to go into the third of his 10 pitches that day. </p> <p>After introducing his team, he launches into the routine. iCrunch, which aggregates and exploits digital music rights in the alternative European market, sees \"a natural extension from dance music to dance culture and being able to go deep and vertical in terms of the music and the lifestyle\", he explains. \"We then add value to it by bundling it with editorial, content and community.\"</p> <p>Phillips, a former AOL executive, is no web wannabe. Just 16 months old, iCrunch is working with 50 music labels, and has deals with HMV and EMusic. It is talking to \"everyone\" from telecoms companies to magazine publishers, including a major music channel with whom it is discussing \"a branded channel distribution deal\".</p> <p>The pitches are slick and seamless. Phillips disarms a question about competitors by comparing Peoplesound.com to the \"meat market\" of the early First Tuesdays. \"This is a more mature, filtered environment... We are getting in the new acts, breaking in the new talent.\"</p> <p>So where are the wannabes? Sometimes you can tell them by their overly-austere suits. DataKlick online marketing research's managing director, Lisanne Davie - aged 23, with punk red hair and a chin stud but tucked into a smart outfit - and her portly director of strategy, David Liley, could fit the description. Davie approached Liley with her idea nine months ago when he was running a web design agency and she was a junior telemarketing officer. He gave up his job to join her.</p> <p>DataKlick, however, is a serious contender. Its vision for making market research \"fun\" for its \"cohort of willing consumers\" is by paying them to take part in market research surveys (from 50p to \u00a33 for a few minutes) and using broadband multimedia streaming. Their company's competitive edge, they maintain, is that it is 20% cheaper than its rivals and can get results within two hours. The second VC they met today offered to write a cheque out for several million if they fulfilled certain criteria which they believe they can meet within six months. Flushed with excitement, they don't want to count their chickens but at this rate they could be floating in 18 months. </p> <p>By far the wackiest pitch was IndiaGeek.com, a broadband channel which according to a co-founder, Farrukh Dhondy, will provide \"satirical and innovative\" programming for the Indian diaspora. Dhondy, a columnist on the Asian Age and former Channel 4 commissioning editor, formed AMI Net last year with Shekhar Kapur, director of Bandit Queen and Elizabeth, and the CEO, Mohan Chopra, backed by money from \"friends and fools\". It has offices in London and Delhi. </p> <p>\"We are building for the day when the computer becomes the TV screen. Whatever John Birt says, the TV is never going to run successful interactive shows,\" says Dhondy. Despite the postmodern name, IndiaGeek claims to be coming up from grassroots. \"There's a new consciousness. Indians are obsessed with Bollywood and yet only one in 100 films succeeds - people are looking for something new.\" The web channel will stream short films, animations, drama, comedy and \"tasteful erotica\". \"Nothing is sacred. We're going to slaughter a lot of holy cows. We are going to do revelations, to take the cover off: corruption, cruelty, slavery, oppression, wife-burning - give India its first burst of investigative and observational documentary films.\" Free from government censorship, IndiaGeek can go where the Asian networks fear to tread.</p> <p>Dhondy believes they have no competition, \"because no one knows what to do with broadband. They see it as a dumping ground for Bollywood films or old TV shows. They are not exploiting the grammar of the net.\"</p> <p>IndiaGeek is hoping to close a deal for $3m in the next few months for a spring launch. From an investors' perspective, too, the day has been fruitful. \"I've seen six companies,\" says Thomas Kenney, of Nokia Ventures, who is over from the US to \"check out the cool technologies, applications, services for 3G mobile internet - investing at an early stage\". He has arranged second meetings with four start-ups. Kenney is \"surprised\" by the 2% brokerage fee that First Tuesday has introduced. \"In the States, if a VC agency asked for that it would be 'get outa here!'.\" But in Europe, he concedes, it is a different market. </p> <p>At the end of the day, no one is exactly walking out with a deal. If they performed well, they have a handful of business cards and invitations to meet up. The next generation of net entrepreneurs crawls into the lobby, exhausted, with their mobile phones beeping, but encouraged that when it comes to broadband a bit of the old dot.com fever still exists.</p>",
  "<p>Imagine the scenario. At the conclusion of their annual shindig in Jackson Hole last week, the world's central bankers decided on a job swap. For the next year, Alan Greenspan would take up the reins at the European Central Bank in Frankfurt with the rest of the federal reserve board, while Wim Duisenberg and his colleagues at the ECB would take up residence in Washington. </p> <p>There is little doubt about what Mr Duisenberg would do faced with US inflation rising at 3.6% a year: he would put up rates in October whatever the consequences for the presidential election in November. But the more interesting question is what Mr Greenspan might do with the European economy if he were in the hot seat tomorrow. The markets are assuming that an ECB rate rise of 0.25 basis points is a certainty, with a half-point increase to bring Euroland inflation back under its 2% ceiling by no means ruled out. </p> <p>But the ECB has put itself in something of a bind. Higher interest rates are supposed to make the euro more attractive to investors by offering a higher rate of return, and this, in turn, should lead to lower inflation. If, after all the hawkish talk of the past few days, the ECB fails to raise rates, the euro will tumble. Yet, it may still tumble even if rates do go up, and the more rates are raised the further it may fall. Why? Because markets these days are less concerned about a currency's yield than about the prospects for growth that it offers. Dealers could easily conclude that higher European rates will choke off Europe's recovery, widening the growth deficit with the booming US economy. If that is the interpretation put on the ECB's decision, the euro will fall not rise, making Europe's alleged inflation problem even worse. This, indeed, seemed to be the way markets were heading yesterday when despite a concerted attempt to talk up the euro, the single currency fell below 90 cents against the dollar. </p> <p>So how would things stand were Mr Greenspan in charge? In the absence of a surge in European productivity to match that in the US, he might conclude that there is no alternative but to raise rates. But, in fact, Mr Greenspan's give-growth-a-chance strategy predated by several years any hard evidence of an improvement in US productivity growth. Were a similar line to be adopted tomorrow, there would be a short-term risk of the euro falling to a new record low. But over the medium term, the euro-dollar rate relies on the relative growth rates of Europe and the United States. Mr Greenspan seems to understand this. The question is: does Mr Duisenberg? </p> <p><strong> Gag exchange </strong><br> </p> <p> It was not wholly expected - participants in the battle for control of the great London Stock Exchange each turning up with a bag of gags. </p> <p>But that is what we got yesterday as Sweden's OM Gruppen, effectively a technology company which specialises in trading systems, tabled its unsolicited \u00a3808m takeover bid. </p> <p>First, we had the Swedes talking about saving the \"crown jewel\", which might be transformed into the future Microsoft of the UK with the right sort of visionary management. Then came the pooh-poohing from inside the exchange, claiming that all this technology is \"not state of the art, not difficult stuff\". </p> <p>In may not be, but if the London exchange had managed to do anything other than botch each and every systems project over the past 15 years its officials might not be in the pickle they are today - actively encouraging a \"white knight\" takeover by Frankfurt's Deutsche B\u00f6rse. </p> <p>What is clear is that we are witnessing the final act of so-called Wimbledonisation of the City. We invented the game, but now watch foreigners take all the trophies. </p> <p>The process has taken three centuries, most vividly illustrated over recent years by the steady capitulation of the City's great family-owned merchant banks which, having survived so many wars and plagues and scandals, finally succumbed to primarily American and German buyers. With capital having gone global, they just did not have the stomach for risk. </p> <p>These buyers, of course, now speak for a good portion of the ownership of the London exchange. And the big investment banks, as we now call them, simply want a market system that allows the most profitable (and global) clients to move in or out of equities with the minimum of fuss and at the lowest possible cost. </p> <p>Against this bloc vote are the small stockbrokers, many of them still British owned, who, in a straightforward sort of way, fear for their jobs. They just cannot understand why London is looking to give anything away while it continues to enjoy such a dominate role in equities across Europe - especially if the technology is such a cinch. </p> <p>The debate, and the education programme, have only just begun.</p>"
