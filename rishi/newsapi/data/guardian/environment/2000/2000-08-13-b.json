  "<p>The delicate, fine-boned woman in the silk Chanel blouse sitting quietly for her photographs in the elegant tea room of a London hotel is not at all what I expected. Naively, I had been picturing Sara Paretsky as her steely, fast-talking heroine, private investigator V. I. Warshawski; brash and tough, with fighting skills honed on the mean streets of Chicago's South Side. </p> <p>This soft-spoken, finely groomed woman with the neat, feathery hair doesn't look as if she often drops down empty lift shafts and flings herself on to the roof of moving trains, and of course there's no reason why she should, except that the detailed authenticity of her Warshawski books convince you that she must have lived at least some of it. But she shares with her character a determination and resilience that flashes sometimes in her quick eyes; like Warshawski - indeed, because of Warshawski - Paretsky knows what it's like to be a woman fighting her way through a man's world. </p> <p>Now that female detectives are almost de rigueur, and Paretsky's own books have over six million copies in print, it's difficult to imagine that only 20 years ago it was virtually unheard of for women to be writing hardboiled crime in the Raymond Chandler vein, and those who did were actively dissuaded from creating female protagonists.</p> <p>'If I hadn't been a crime fiction reader, I might never have tried to write for publication,' Paretsky says. 'Women didn't do that. But I got this bug that I wanted to have a woman detective, because I was so put off by the way women in crime fiction acted. Either they weren't there at all, or they would be total victims, or they'd be sexually active, so then you knew they were rotten to the core.' </p> <p>Paretsky has been working to fracture stereotypes of women since childhood. She grew up with her four brothers in rural Kansas, where her father was the first Jewish teacher to be hired by the university. 'We were like a family of giraffes,' she smiles. 'All the fundamentalist Christians wanted to come round and see if it was really true that we had little horns.'</p> <p>I ask if she felt isolated at school and she offers a little shrug. 'Sometimes, but not because of being Jewish - more because my parents were very contemptuous of ordinary social conventions.' Her parents were bookish and fond of music and Paretsky describes her mother as 'a phenomenal storyteller, much more inventive than I am,' which might have seemed an ideal environment to encourage an intelligent young woman. But after school, Paretsky encountered another glass ceiling to be broken through. </p> <p>'Although my parents were very progressive in their social and racial politics, they were very conservative in their sexual politics,' she says, slightly sadly but without bitterness. 'They had four boys to educate and they didn't think it was really worth educating girls, because they just get married and their education goes to waste. It was very hurtful at the time.' Instead of university, she was sent to secretarial school, but afterwards took a job as a dishwasher to fund herself through university; she went on to do a PhD in history and a master's in business. </p> <p>A summer of community service work in Chicago with deprived children ignited her obssession with the city that forms the backdrop to the Warshawski novels, and where Paretsky still lives with her husband. Warshawski came later, while Paretsky was working for a large insurance firm. </p> <p>'It was the fall of '78, and I was in a meeting with this guy who was really lethal and undermining all his subordinates - not just the women, he was evil to everyone who worked for him. And I suddenly thought, \"Here is my detective. She's a woman like me, but when she meets a guy like, I'll call him Fred, she doesn't worry about what to say. She's not afraid of getting fired or being nice, she just says whatever's in that balloon over her head, which we nice girls were brought up not to do\".' </p> <p>So she embarked on the first Warshawski novel, Indemnity Only, published in 1982. 'It took a long time to find a publisher - not only because I was a woman with a woman detective, but mainly because New York is so parochial, they thought no-one would read a novel about Chicago.' </p> <p>Paretsky is a woman with political ideals and a strong social conscience, unafraid to get her hands dirty with projects such as mentoring girls in inner-city schools or working with refugees. Her books tackle difficult issues, but she resists being described as a 'political' writer. 'Political fiction tends to be pretty dreary when it's trying to make a point. In a way I think my literary role model is Dickens,' she says, without a hint of self-consciousness, 'in that he was a great storyteller, but the stories came against the backdrop of the horrific social inequities that existed in London in the 1850s and that he had experienced first hand. </p> <p>'I think because it's always been such a struggle for me to find a voice and get people to listen to me, I am more focused on people who are voiceless. But storyline and characters absorb me much more than the political stuff.' Nevertheless, her tenth novel, Hard Time (Penguin \u00a35.99), its title a deliberate homage, has Warshawski confronting high-level corruption: abuses in the prison system, globalisation of the media, the exploitation of immigrant workers. </p> <p>'It really concerns me the way government is for sale these days, and the massive amounts of money companies can spend to buy the legislation they want. So if you don't have an independent press that is really diligent there's no way that abuses will be exposed or people called to account. So if your press is all owned by Hollywood studios, and these are the people who are giving a hundred million dollars a year to George Bush, then...' she spreads her hands out, indicating helplessness. </p> <p>If that makes the book sound worthy and heavy-going, fear not - she is quite right about story line taking precedence. Hard Time had me sitting up most of the night until I finished it. But it is a harrowing read in places, particularly in her exposure of the way women prisoners are treated. Although not allowed into women's prisons, she spent a lot of time talking to former prisoners and lawyers and there is a quiet anger and frustration in the book. </p> <p>'I felt angry, and I felt really powerless,' she says, with fierce eyes. 'The average age of a woman in an American prison is 20, 65 per cent are illiterate, 80 per cent are black or Hispanic. There's a tremendous amount of sexual assault and violence, and if the women complain they get put in solitary. It was hard for me to put V.I. behind bars because I like her to be in control, not to be that vulnerable where she got beaten up and nearly killed.' She pauses and looks thoughtful. 'I hope I never have to go to prison,' she says earnestly. 'I don't think I'd be strong enough, physically or mentally.' </p> <p>Perhaps not physically, but I would not doubt the strength of her mind. Paretsky is a fighter and you wouldn't want to be one of the bad guys.</p>",
  "<p>Children taught at home significantly outperform their contemporaries who go to school, the first comparative study has found.</p> <p>It discovered that home-educated children of working-class parents achieved considerably higher marks in tests than the children of professional, middle-class parents and that gender differences in exam results disappear among home-taught children.</p> <p>The study, to be published by the University of Durham in the autumn, will support a call for the Government to introduce legislation to help the growing army of parents who are choosing to remove their children from schools. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/oct/11/unschool-children-monitor-home-schooling-education\">Rise of the home \u2018unschoolers\u2019  \u2013 where children learn only what they want to</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The number of home-educated children in Britain has grown from practically none 20 years ago to about 150,000 today - around 1 per cent of the school age population. By the end of the decade, the figure is expected to have tripled. Home education has won so much support in Scotland that more than 200 campaigners from across Britain are to march to the Scottish Parliament next month to demand a relaxation in legislation which makes it harder for parents to educate their children at home in Scotland than in England and Wales. </p> <p>\u2018Home-educated children do better in conventional terms and in every other way too,\u2019 said Paula Rothermel, a lecturer in learning in early childhood at the University of Durham, who spent three years conducting the survey. She said: \u2018This study is the first evidence we have proving that home education is a huge benefit to large numbers of children. Society just assumes that school is best but because there have never been any comparative studies before this one, the assumption is baseless.\u2019 </p> <p>Rothermel questioned 100 home-educating families chosen randomly across the UK, conducting face-to-face interviews and detailed appraisals of their children\u2019s academic progress, in line with recognised Government tests. She found that 65 per cent of home-educated children scored more than 75 per cent in a general mathematics and literacy test, compared to a national figure of only 5.1 per cent. The average national score for school-educated pupils in the same test was 45 per cent, while that of the home-educated children was 81 per cent. </p> <p>Rothermel said: \u2018The improved exam results could be down to the sheer quantity of parental attention and the sense of long-term security that gives them... It could also be down to the fact that families who home educate from birth had worked with their children from the word go and without the disruptive transition at an early age to the very different environment of school.\u2019 </p> <p>Rothermel found that the children of working-class, poorly-educated parents significantly outperformed their middle-class contemporaries. While the five- to six-year old children of professional parents scored only 55.2 per cent in the test, children far lower down the social scale scored 71 per cent. Rothermel said: \u2018This was really a staggering finding, but better-educated parents are probably more laid back than poorly-educated parents and so are less likely to push their children.\u2019 </p> <p>Alison Preuss, a mother of three, has been home teaching for six years and is director of Schoolhouse, a Scottish support group for parents who have opted out of conventional schooling. She said: \u2018In school [children] have knowledge poured into them, while at home they\u2019re proactive in choosing what they learn. It\u2019s a better preparation for university because they are used to motivating themselves. </p> <p>\u2018Their social skills and general knowledge are more advanced because they\u2019re not restricted by the confines of a national curriculum. They can explore a huge variety of subjects, concentrating in depth on whichever ones capture their imagination.\u2019</p>",
  "Building a state is a monumental, precarious and rarely peaceful business. Even some states we now consider natural parts of the landscape are recent creations which have stood on the edge of disintegration within living memory. Losing the colonial war in Algeria nearly brought France to its knees. From South Korea to Argentina, Greece to Egypt, it's a similar story. The panoply of flags, rule of law, orderly changes of government, civil peace and relative economic stability are all recent and hard-won achievements. And although it is now lost in the sands of time, Britain, too, had its share of civil war, murder and division before the contemporary British state emerged at the end of the seventeenth century. <p>It is in this context that Vladimir Putin, this week celebrating his first year in office as first Prime Minister and latterly as President, should be judged. In the West, Putin is now seen as the butcher of Chechnya, the ex-KGB stooge with a scant regard for democracy, liberty and market economics, whatever lip service he pays to its principles. As he appoints his old security friends to key Ministries and offices, we should be wary of another instinctive authoritarian rebuilding his power base in Russia. We should hold our noses and keep our distance. Putin is the next Pinochet. </p> <p>But has the West been misreading the Russian leader? Cast Putin as a state builder, the necessary if insufficient precondition to establishing a successful capitalism in Russia, and you start to see him in a different light. Moreover, he begins his endeavours from a disastrous starting point. Russia moved from a crumbling Tsarist structure to an authoritarian police state in one jump. After its collapse, there is no system of contract and property law; no impartial bureaucracy or judiciary; no common glue holding civil society together; little sense of governmental legitimacy. </p> <p>He is constructing a state on a site where the old, corrupt outgrowths of communism still flourish and in a country with more than 100 ethnic groups, some of whom, like the Chechens, do not accept any authority or legitimacy beyond their ethnic boundaries. </p> <p>The often forgotten advantage of communism was that, whatever its massive failings, it did offer a unifying ideology to a part of Euro-Asia otherwise riven by vicious ethnic hatreds. Tito, for example, never accepted the economistic interpretation of communism that implied no role for markets or private enterprise; he expressly ran Yugoslavia as a mixed economy. For him, communism was the perfect political doctrine for holding a fissile, ethnically divided community together; ethnic cleansing was ideologically outlawed. </p> <p>Many professional middle-class Russians took the same view about the Soviet Union. At least communism kept the ethnic menace at bay and could hold the country together effectively. The endless parades in 1945, piling up German battle standards in Red Square, were a self-conscious repetition of what Tsar Alexander had done after victory over Napoleon, propagandising communism's effectiveness as a substitute for an orthodox state. </p> <p>The events of the last decade amply justify the fears about Russia's governability. The small army of ideological free-market economists who argued that the sole preconditions for a successful capitalism were private property and flexible prices were not simply economically na\u00efve, they were political innocents who had forgotten their history. Of course, in the absence of a strong centre and no cultural, ethnic or political reason to be loyal to Moscow, the governors in Russia's cities, provinces and federal regions would spend money like water to keep their restless, poverty-stricken and ethnically diverse populations happy without collecting taxes, the heart of the still massive government budget deficit and proximate cause of the high and volatile inflation rate. </p> <p>And, of course, capitalism in a state that could not offer even relative price stability, impartial justice, trustworthy banks and the rule of law would quickly collapse into quasi-banditry. Add the ghastly economic legacy of communism, with its massive inefficiencies, and the whole cocktail was likely to deliver what it has - economic collapse and a vacuum of political authority on a titanic scale. On one calculation, 80 per cent of businesses and 60 per cent of the state are said to be corrupt; even those figures could be an underestimate. In this respect, the infamous 'oligarchs', the Mafia-style bosses who dominate Russia's business through gangsterism, are as much the symptom as the cause of Russia's ills. </p> <p>Putin not only understands all this, he says so openly and is acting to correct it. His state-of-the-nation address to the Duma last month was astonishingly frank. The Russian government and state processes are the principal causes of 'raging corruption', the outflow of capital and the 'dictatorship of the black economy', he said. What was impeding economic growth were the twin enemies of criminal business and corrupt officialdom. Yet there was no going back to a command economy and communism. The only way forward was capitalism, but, paradoxically, that required strong political authority at the centre, an authority that would be strengthened rather than weakened by free media scrutiny, the rule of law, democratic competition and impartial administration. Who can disagree? </p> <p>Putin is acting extraordinarily bravely in the circumstances. He has appointed seven federal super-governors charged with curbing the autonomy and spending of 89 provincial and regional political bosses. This is not just a political but an economic necessity as their spending now constitutes 40 per cent of all public spending. On top, he has insisted that all taxes should be collected centrally, a privilege which the regional governors guarded jealously against all Yeltsin's efforts but which they have now ceded to Putin. No concession at this juncture on autonomy was ever possible to the Chechens; it would have undermined the entire effort to re-engineer the Russian state. </p> <p>Having concentrated tax-raising powers in the centre, he has signalled he intends to exploit his new authority. A fortnight ago, he held his infamous meeting with 21 leading 'oligarchs' in which he read the riot act - there could be no more tax avoidance, no more shipping money abroad and no more doing deals by literally holding a gun to people's heads. Already, he grimly warned them, he had permitted the temporary arrest of Vladimir Gusinsky, a Murdoch-style media mogul and challenged Boris Berezovsky, the businessman closest to Yeltsin. More would follow. Last Thursday, as good as his word, Russian tax police raided the headquarters of the giant oil company Sibneft, run by another of the oligarchs close to Yeltsin and hitherto untouched. </p> <p>All this is to serve a 10-year plan of economic reform, sequencing investment first in manufacturing and later in high-tech industries, raising growth, curbing inflation and cutting the budget deficit. The plan, modelled on what the Japanese and South Koreans have done, is criticised by free marketeers as too statist, but as their advice has been so calamitous they have little or no credibility. Yet even to get near achieving it, Putin is having to reconstruct a state; he's showing every sign of possessing the vision and nerve to pull it off. </p> <p>Tony Blair has been derided for so quickly offering his support, but he is right. Putin has his warts and he has yet to prove his commitment to media freedom, human rights and genuine democracy. Yet he is doing what has to be done within extraordinary constraints and in an extraordinary environment. We need him to succeed.</p>",
  "They make good pictures. Flames, smoke and drama raging uncontrolled across the western states of America; women and children, the helpless victims of torrential floods, made homeless in India; Masai warriors taking their cattle across Kenya's Uhuru highway to find water in Nairobi. <p>It is not just that our lust for dramatic pictures (and their availability) has made us more aware of natural disasters - their incidence is genuinely increasing. Five of the hottest years of the last millennium took place in the 1990s. The twentieth-century's 10 warmest years all occurred in its last 15 years. Snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere and ice floes in the Arctic Ocean have decreased. Globally, the sea level rose between four and 10 inches over the past century. Worldwide, precipitation over land has increased by about 1 per cent. </p> <p>Certainly, humans have devised many more ways of destroying nature's delicate checks and balances, for example by ill-considered economic development along river banks which causes deforestation, soil erosion and, ultimately, uncontrollable flooding. None the less, no one, not even the United States government, any longer doubts that carbon emissions in industrialised countries have led to the much-predicted greenhouse effect and consequent global warming. In January, the United States National Academy of Sciences panel found that surface air temperatures had increased by 0.7 to 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit over the past 100 years. </p> <p>The case for lowering carbon-dioxide emissions is now overwhelming. Since the adoption of the Kyoto protocol in 1997, when major countries agreed to work toward reducing CO &lt;-&gt;2 <!----> emissions, US policy has been held hostage by special interests, particularly those in the oil industry. Now, all major presidential runners have made the giant step of accepting the truth of global warming. This provides an opportunity. </p> <p>The next global-warming conference will be held in the Hague in November. The US is set to propose that the Kyoto targets should be amended to include the notion of 'carbon sinks'. Countries which demonstrate improved crop land and forest management (which can absorb carbon dioxide) would be given carbon credits to trade against their emissions. In other words, the pressure would be off industry to reduce CO &lt;-&gt;2 <!----> emissions. </p> <p>It is an ingenious idea but deeply flawed, self-evidently so now that so much of US forest land is burning. The weather events in this infant millennium alone are sufficient to declare a global emergency. The US should treat it as such and take unequivocal action in the Hague to adopt the Kyoto targets.</p>",
  "The two men could not look more different. One is lean and frosty in his sharply pressed military fatigues and trademark aviator sunglasses. The other is tubby, loud and was a one-time putative father-in-law of Diana, Princess of Wales. <p>But Mohamed al-Fayed, owner of Harrods of Knightsbridge, and Hun Sen, strongman Prime Minister of Cambodia, have found a common interest that no one ever suspected: oil. </p> <p>Cambodia is the latest in a series of exotic locations targeted by Fayed as he looks for more ways to make money. On 21 March, Hun Sen and Fayed spent two hours in a plush office in the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh, discussing an oil concession in the poverty-stricken state. </p> <p>For Hun Sen such a deal could mean investment for his economy and diplomatic legitimacy for his regime, and for Fayed a sought-after entry into a virtually untapped, fabulously lucrative source of oil and gas. </p> <p>For environmentalists and human rights activists, the deal raises grave concerns. </p> <p>Fayed had flown into the city's Ponchentong airport following an invitation from Hun Sen through a mutual friend. The Egyptian-born tycoon, 67, was in Thailand to oversee the expansion of his recently launched oil exploration projects, run by Harrods Energy, a Bermuda-registered company. </p> <p>The company's Bangkok-based subsidiary recently spent $4 million (\u00a32.7m) on a stake in the natural gas exploration block in the Gulf of Thailand. </p> <p>Analysts see Cambodia as one of the few remaining 'virgin territories' for oil. 'No one is sure how much there is to be had, but there is a good chance of making a lot of money for minimal outlay,' one Malaysia-based expert said. </p> <p>One company reported to already have a presence in Cambodia is Unocal, an American oil firm widely criticised for its involvement with the hardline Taliban regime in Afghanistan. </p> <p>Human rights activists are already criticising Fayed for doing business with Hun Sen. The Cambodian leader seized power in a bloody coup three years ago. Since then he has been accused of murdering scores of political opponents. A United Nations report accused him of running an elite military unit which killed and tortured at least 40 activists from the ousted Royalist Party during the takeover. </p> <p>Elections in 1998, though given approval by international observers, are widely believed to have been rigged and marred by widespread intimidation of voters. A 45- year-old opposition party worker died from a blow to the back of the head after having an ear sliced off and his eyes gouged out. The police recorded a verdict of suicide. </p> <p>During the election, government security forces violently put down pro-democracy demonstrations, shooting and killing protesters who included Buddhist monks. A spokesman for Amnesty International said yesterday: 'Businesses must use their influence to ensure they are not linked in any way to human rights abuses. The bottom line is that if they fail to do so, their corporate reputation will suffer.' </p> <p>But Fayed has never shied away from controversy. In April he announced a deal with Libya's Colonel Muammar Gadaffi, who is still under US sanctions. Fayed's Harrods Petroleum company is to help the Libyan national oil organisation develop three major fields. </p> <p>Fayed's talks with Hun Sen in March centred on the exploration of three oilfields in the centre of Cambodia close to the famous Tonle Sap lake system, the world's largest freshwater fishery. </p> <p>Last week a spokesman for Fayed confirmed that Harrods companies were involved in seismic surveys in the Battambang, Pusat and Kampong Chhang regions just to the west of the Tonle Sap. Some of the fields are only 50 miles from the famous Angkor Wat temple systems, one of the most delicate archaeological treasures in the world. </p> <p>He also confirmed that the exploration was aimed at establishing if oil and gas in two major subterranean basins is of sufficient quality to warrant further investment. The basins extend under the lake and environmentalists fear that any development in the region could have disastrous results. 'It is a fragile eco-system and any accident would have a massive effect. If something went wrong, there is nothing there to tackle it,' said Patrick Alley, co-founder of Global Witness, campaigners in Cambodia. Alley pointed out that, with its enormous fisheries, the lake provides 70 per cent of the protein consumed by Cambodia's 10 million people, most of whom live around its shores. </p> <p>After years of war and the devastation wrought by Pol Pot and his extremist Maoist Khmer Rouge, everyone agrees that Cambodia - where life expectancy is still only 48 - desperately needs investment. 'But I would be happier if the government were dealing with a company with a more established track record,' Alley said. </p> <p>Harrods said last week: 'Mr al-Fayed realises the importance of the environment and will not engage in any drilling or exploration to the detriment of the environment. He is keen to increase revenue for the country to benefit the population of Cambodia but the environment must come first. </p> <p>'Harrods Energy has a long history of work and studies carried out to protect the environment before carrying out any exploration.' </p> <p> jason.burke@observer.co.uk</p>",
  "An environmental disaster off the British coast was averted when the skipper of a huge oil tanker and his senior crew allegedly went drinking on land and capsized their inflatable craft on the way back, The Observer can reveal. <p>In an incident described as 'horrifying' by environmentalists, the Matco Clyde, owned by Exxon-Mobil and involved in one of the world's worst oil disasters, in Alaska 11 years ago, was left with a depleted crew while the skipper and three crew went out drinking in gale-force winds and rough seas. </p> <p>The allegations, to be aired in a court case next month and which Exxon has tried to keep secret, hark back to 23 March this year. The Matco Clyde, which carries up to 100,000 tonnes of oil, was anchored 12 miles off Buckie in north-east Scotland. The wind had hit force seven when the captain, chief engineer, third mate and bosun went ashore in an inflatable dinghy. According to sources, they went drinking and allegedly ignored a request by the chief mate, who was looking after the vessel, to return when the weather worsened. </p> <p>At about 6pm, the captain and fellow crew tried to make their way back to the tanker in the Moray Firth when their dinghy lost power and capsized, leading to a full-scale air and sea rescue. </p> <p>A helicopter airlifted the crew to RAF Lossiemouth, where a rescuer reported the crew appeared drunk. 'Their breath smelt of drink,' one source told The Observer . </p> <p>An environmentalist with knowledge of the incident said last night: 'The company had to launch an investigation due to the high-profile rescue. If not for that, the incident probably would have been covered up, as is the case for most large companies.' </p> <p>The Maritime and Coastguard Agency immediately revoked the captain's and the chief engineer's shipping licences, preventing them from going to sea. The agency would not comment on the details, which will be disputed in a shipping tribunal court on 18 September in Eastleigh, Hampshire. But this is the first time the agency has suspended such a licence before the outcome of a full investigation. </p> <p>The crew deny that they were drunk and they have the backing of their trade union, the National Union of Marine, Aviation and Shipping Transport Officers, which is angry that the Coastguard Agency suspended their licences before the inquiry. </p> <p>It is understood that the seamen will claim they were suffering from hypothermia, which causes slurred speech and bad co-ordination, and that this might have been confused with drunkenness. </p> <p>The incident involving the 18-year-old Matco Clyde will inflame sensitivities in Scotland, where locals are still dealing with the consequences of the Braer oil tanker sinking off the Shetlands in 1993, spilling more than 80,000 tonnes. </p> <p>Exxon was responsible for one of the world's worst ecological disasters when the Exxon Valdez foundered off the Alaskan coast in 1989 and blighted the area with more than 11 million gallons of spilt oil. </p> <p>A statement made to The Observer by Exxon said: 'We can confirm an incident took place involving crew members of the Matco Clyde while returning to the vessel in March 2000. The incident did not involve the Matco Clyde vessel. A full investigation was started immediately and crew members involved were suspended pending the result of that investigation.' </p> <p>Environmental campaigners have long been concerned about drinking among crews of large oil tankers. Tony Juniper, director of Friends of the Earth, said: 'It is shocking Exxon appears not to have learnt from the Valdez disaster and is playing Russian roulette with the environment.' </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:antony.barnett@observer.co.uk\">antony.barnett@observer.co.uk</a></p> <p><b>Useful links:</b></p> <p>For Friends of the Earth: <a href=\"http://www.foe.co.uk\" target=\"new\">www.foe.co.uk</a><br>On survivors of the Exxon Valdez oil-spill: <a href=\"http://www.exxonvaldez.org\" target=\"new\">www.exxonvaldez.org</a></p>",
  "<p>The mapping of the human genome has confirmed Darwin's theory of evolution, according to Bill Castell, chief executive of Nycomed Amersham. He is hoping that the Nasdaq flotation of Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (APB) will finally persuade investors that his group has evolved into one of the stars of the healthcare industry. </p> <p>Nycomed Amersham has undoubtedly made great strides since 1990 when, to quote Castell, its idea of innovation was to put radioactive material in a different-shaped phial. Now, it is a global business with a market-leading position in imaging, its instruments were used to sequence three of the first four chromosomes to be mapped, and it is a market leader in the fast-growing area of genetic sequencing. </p> <p>The City has not ignored the transformation. A share price which is about 29 times the expected earnings for the full year is a decent premium to the market, but is more than 10 per cent below pharmaceuticals companies such as GlaxoWellcome or its betrothed, SmithKline Beecham. And they do not have a hi-tech gene mapping subsidiary to float. </p> <p>Nycomed Amersham is clearly convinced that floating 10 per cent of APB, planned for the autumn, will unlock hidden value in the group. The genetic blueprint may now be complete, but the big bucks will be made in exploiting that information. There are plenty of rivals muscling in on its territory, but none covers the waterfront in quite the way Nycomed Amersham does. </p> <p>Analysts estimate that the business will attract a valuation between $4 billion and $6bn (\u00a32.6bn to \u00a34bn). That would value its share at around \u00a31.9bn, leaving the remainder of Amersham's businesses valued at just over \u00a32bn, or less than 20 times earnings. True, some parts of the business - such as its seeds for cancer therapy and some of its unpatented products - are achieving pedestrian sales growth. But the core imaging business managed a 17 per cent sales increase, driven by products such as Myoview, its heart diagnostic product. </p> <p>Critics point out that half of APB is in research products, where sales last year rose by just 3 per cent, and wonder whether the float will achieve the valuations predicted. And they question whether the rest of Amersham deserves a premium rating. But Castell and his team have done an excellent job evolving Amersham from a public-sector monolith to a highly focused, innovative business. That will eventually be recognised in the price. Buy the shares. </p> <p><strong> Reed sounds a stronger note</strong><br> </p> <p> Crispin Davis's appointment as chief executive of Reed Elsevier may not have been greeted with universal acclaim but, a year on, the City is finally warming to his approach. Interim profit before tax may have fallen 4 per cent, after adjusting for things like currency and exceptional items, but that was because of increased investment on internet initiatives. The underlying picture was of a business which not only knows where it wants to go - something the old management was good at - but also has a plan to get there. </p> <p>There are new executives in key management positions (apart from finance director) and Davis appears to have tight control. The \u00a3750 million three-year internet investment programme announced in February is already bearing fruit. So far, \u00a3110m has been spent, rising to \u00a3260m by the year-end. </p> <p>Internet-generated sales reached \u00a3160m in the first six months of 2000, and are expected to be \u00a3400m for the whole year. The science division was the biggest beneficiary. But there are also signs that it has managed to stop the rot in the legal business, where it has launched a service for small firms and is establishing a good presence in universities. </p> <p>On cost control, it is likely to exceed the promised \u00a3130m savings this year, suggesting there was a lot more fat in the group than analysts realised. </p> <p>The only thing that really spooked the City was Davis's interest in US publisher Harcourt Brace, which is up for sale. But analysts take the view that Davis was expressing more a healthy interest in the affairs of its rivals than a serious intention to acquire. </p> <p>After a faltering start, Reed's shares have recovered strongly in the past two months. They may now pause for breath, but those prepared to wait for their rewards should buy now. </p> <p><strong> Bolt from Colt is over the top</strong><br> </p> <p> The collapse in Colt Telecom's share price after Paul Chisholm, its president and chief executive, announced that he planned to spend more time with his family in the US, perfectly illustrates how illogical the City's attitude to technology stocks is. </p> <p>Colt Telecom is one of the more successful of the new generation of phone operators. It has done all it promised in establishing its European network, attracting large corporate customers and increasing its revenue. </p> <p>The number of buildings connected to its network in the second quarter of the year jumped by 68 per cent over last year, while the number of minutes switched rose by 138 per cent. Profits are, of course, still a rather distant prospect but at least it has funds - \u00a32bn to be precise - which should be enough to get it into that position. </p> <p>Chisolm's departure is significant. He was the driving force behind the company's growth and will be missed. But he is hardly making a dash for the door with binbags full of trade secrets. Indeed, he is doing all he can to ensure an orderly succession: he will not finally depart for Boston until next year, and will stay on the board after a successor is appointed. </p> <p>But such high-flying companies are valued less on common sense than on sentiment. Any unexpected news is likely to move the price sharply. That does not make it logical, however. Compared with some of the internet upstarts, Colt is well established with a long pedigree. A new chief executive, backed by the existing management team, should be well equipped to carry the business forward. Investors have some cause to be worried about how Colt's business model will adapt in the face of rapidly changing telephone technology. </p> <p>The slump following Chisolm's departure looks overdone.</p>",
  "<p>Skanska, the Swedish construction giant, is preparing to bid for a major UK building firm in a move that confirms the growing pressure for construction firms to consolidate. </p> <p>Skanska, which in the past two weeks has bought building groups in the US and the Czech Republic, told The Observer that it has a \u00a31 billion war chest and is hoping to strike a deal soon. </p> <p>'We've always regarded the UK as an attractive market,' said Peter Wallin, Skanska's head of investor relations. 'Over the past two years, we have approached a couple of companies, but it's been hard to reach deals even though the price of the sector has slumped. The UK still is interesting to us, though, and we would like to agree something soon.' </p> <p>It is understood that Skanska's preferred targets are Balfour Beatty, Carillion and, possibly, Amec. </p> <p>Industry analysts believe Skanska, which last year turned over \u00a38 billion and employs 60,000 people worldwide, is more likely to bid for Carillion. 'I see a bid of between 180p and 190p appealing to management,' one said. Such a bid would value Carillion at \u00a3400 million. </p> <p>Skanska has positioned itself to become one of the world's biggest construction firms. It has sold most of its non-core assets, including a chunk of UK property, and has virtually no debt. </p> <p>Shares in Britain's major building groups companies rose over the past month following Chancellor Gordon Brown's Comprehensive Spending Review. </p> <p>Since 18 July Amec has risen 40 per cent, Laing is up 25 per cent, while Balfour Beatty has risen 20 per cent. </p> <p>Brown's \u00a343bn windfall means that growth in the construction sector is set to double to 3 per cent. </p> <p>The global construction industry is in the midst of consolidation. The takeover frenzy has been sparked by customers rapidly slashing their list of contractors and giving performance incentives to those that remain, in a bid to match the efficiency gained by the rationalisation in most sectors. </p> <p>Already this year Amec has bought Canadian project management firm Agra for \u00a3220m. Last month, Vinci, the construction arm of Vivendi, agreed a deal for Groupe GTM, making it the biggest European construction company. And Bouygues, the sector leader until Vinci's announcement, has bought up all the remaining shares in Colas, its road-building arm. </p> <p>Blue Circle, Britain's biggest cement producer, last May narrowly fought off a hostile takeover bid by French group Lafarge.</p>",
  "On 14 May 1913, the Omega Workshops were registered as a company in London's Fitzroy Square, not far from Tottenham Court Road. They were set up by Roger Fry, alongside other Bloomsbury friends, the painters Vanessa Bell and Duncan Grant. Out of the workshops came their own idiosyncratic style of naive surface decoration, colour and pattern, applied to everything from ceramics, textiles, and carpets to woodcuts, tiles, and larger pieces of hand-painted furniture. <p>The Omega Workshops were ahead of their time. More than 80 years later, with stores such as Habitat, Heals, The Pier and Purves &amp; Purves on Tottenham Court Road, the area is a mecca for shoppers in search of furniture, sofas, kitchenware and trinkets for the home. But in the past month, the spirit of Bell and Grant has been revived in a corner of Charlotte Street, not far from the location of the Omega Workshops. </p> <p>Charlotte Street is the latest venture by Tim and Kit Kemp, the entrepreneur/ interior designer husband and wife team who, since 1985, have been quietly building up an empire of six 'boutique' hotels across London, including the Covent Garden Hotel, favoured by the film/fashion/ celebrity set long before New York hotelier Ian Schrager's hip hotels opened. In fact, Schrager, along with Philippe Starck and his team, shacked up in the Covent Garden while in London working on their own hotels. Christina Ricci moved in for six months while she was filming Sleepy Hollow . And over the years, regular guests at the Kemp hotels have included Giorgio Armani, Calvin Klein, Isaac Mizrahi, Linda Evangelista, Helena Christensen, Kathleen Turner and Jeanne Moreau. </p> <p>The property on Charlotte Street - an impressive 1888 building which was last used as a dental warehouse - was spotted by the couple two years ago, and has been given the Kemp treatment over the past 18 months. Its doors opened in July, without any fanfare. Instead, Meg Ryan has made the odd impromptu appearance, simply wandering in off the street for a coffee at the brasserie, and an American film director took a residency for a few weeks in one of the hotel's two penthouses. </p> <p>The starting point for Kit Kemp's interior design came from the Bloomsbury style and the Omega Workshops. In the brasserie, there is a mural, painted in the style of some 1916 frescoes entitled Scenes of Contemporary London Life by Roger Fry and his Omega colleagues for a client at a smart Berkeley Street address. Kemp commissioned a work in homage to it, with the London of 2000 as his inspiration. The people in the mural are chatting into mobile phones, and wearing jeans and trainers. It wraps around the brasserie, giving the place a life and vibrancy even when it is empty. This is typical Kemp. She knows how to take a reference from the past and make it fresh and of the moment. Instead of shipping in a team of set builders and stylists to recreate Charleston, the Sussex home of Vanessa Bell and Duncan Grant, Kemp has simply sprinkled the place with the Bloomsbury influence, with specially commissioned wallpaper, printed with a detail from an Omega woodprint, the odd piece of hand-painted furniture, and a collection of paintings and woodcuts, including work by Vanessa Bell, Duncan Grant, Roger Fry and Henry Lamb. </p> <p>Kemp spent a large chunk of the budget on the art collection, and it is what gives the hotel a more intimate, personal appeal. Wander into the spacious lobby, and the first thing you see is a 1967 sculpture by Lyn Chadwick on loan by the artist, who is also a friend of the Kemps'. There are also two abstract landscapes by the Wales-based painter Roger Cecil. A larger-than-life plaster ram's head watches over the comings and goings - a find at one of Kemp's favourite shops, Talisman Antiques in Dorset. In the smaller of two lounges, there are fat, squidgy sofas, where you can sit and admire the Roger Fry still life of flowers, the Henry Lamb line drawing, and the charmingly child-like flower painting by Winifred Nicholson. Kemp found it at the Art 2000 fair in north London, and couldn't resist splashing out \u00a310,000 for it. </p> <p>The artworks look quite at home in the lounge, alongside a series of framed dry herbs, found by Kit on her travels in France, and the Bloomsbury-style standard lamp with painted shade. In the bigger lounge, which looks out over Rathbone Street, there is work by Vanessa Bell and Duncan Grant, and a more contemporary painting of beach huts by Keith Purser. </p> <p>'The art was the starting point for the interiors,' says Kemp. 'I didn't want to do a pastiche on the past. It had to look cooler, airy and modern. The art works within it.' The theme is carried through into the 52 bedrooms, each of which is decorated in a different style. Room 500 has an African theme, with giraffe-print sofas and wood prints from the Hogarth Press. Another room is decorated in pink, with embroidered tulips. Each room has its own little gem, be it artwork or hand-made furniture. 'It's good to mix a modern feel with older objects,' says Kemp, who knows a good hotel when she stays in one. She has just returned from the Hotel du Palais Biarritz, which was built for Eugenie by Napoleon. Two other favourites are the Posta Vecchia near Rome, a Renaissance palazzo which became a hotel after J Paul Getty, who furnished and lived in it, sold it, lock stock and marble fireplace, in the 70s. 'They have a vegetable garden,' says Kemp, 'and guests eat whatever is in season.' </p> <p>It's all about the personal touch. In 1985, when the Kemps opened their first hotel, the chintzy, homely Dorset Square, and the capital's first country-house hotel, such places were still a novelty in London. The discerning business traveller had to make do with the older, more traditional hotels. 'Hotels were so stereotyped then - all cellophane-packed, not individual at all. We wanted to put a bit of adventure back into the hotel.' Since then, London has sprouted enough posh and stylish hotels to rival New York, with the Metropolitan, the Hempel, the Sanderson and St Martins Lane, One Aldwych, My Hotel off Tottenham Court Road, and Terence Conran's recent Great Eastern Hotel in Liverpool Street. And there is the Kemps's own empire, including the Pelham in South Kensington, and Durley House in Sloane Street. Already, they are working on their next venture, 16 Sumner Place in South Kensington, which promises to provide chic b&amp;b and a gorgeous garden for the stylish traveller spending their own money. This autumn, Kit will also put the finishing touches to their new restaurant in Westbourne Park Road. </p> <p>'People are more sophisticated now,' she says. 'They read magazines like Departures and Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveller and they don't want to have a mass-produced experience.' And with Charlotte Street, Kit Kemp has created an environment in which Virginia Woolf herself might have felt at home.</p> <p>\u0095 Charlotte Street Hotel, 15 Charlotte Street, London W1 (020 7907 4000)</p>",
  "What is the ultimate high? And why do so many of us expend so much time, energy and money looking for it? Being catapulted 1,000ft in the air in the front seat of a glider, bungee jumping from a bridge or abseiling off a cliff are all adequate metaphors for the ultimate high. Any external experience that pushes you up against death will trigger the release of adrenaline, the internally produced chemical most associated with the high of a peak experience. <p>Others are more inclined to take their brush with death less dramatically, by ingesting psychotropic substances or meditating. Le petit mort , the little death experienced during orgasm, is a big favourite, as is the momentary loss of self while dancing or playing live music. Even clinching business deals can produce an ecstatic effect. </p> <p>But unless you've learned to defy the basic laws of gravity, the problem with an ultimate high is that it is inevitably succeeded by an ultimate low. Which is fine as long as you have the time and will to process it. </p> <p>The ancient Taoists, together with all practitioners of authentic spiritual paths, keenly observed the perpetual interplay between peak and trough, calling it yin and yang. They then decided to eschew chasing the jagged peaks, aspiring instead to attaining a high mountain plateau state, affecting mind body and spirit simultaneously. This sustainable high they called the t'ai chi - literally, the supreme ultimate. </p> <p>As we are all subject to pressurised lifestyles, we might find it desirable to aspire to this plateau, which incorporates all our daily activities. </p> <p>What it boils down to is training yourself to relax your body and breathing. Then step behind the thoughts in your mind so that you can preside over them, like a general observing the troops. </p> <p>At the same time, relax your chest. This will enable you to feel love for others: not an airy fairy, romanticised love where you idealise people, ignoring their thorns or missiles, but a grounded compassion for the essential being within each of us, behind all the various disguises (bank manager, artist, IT expert, etc). </p> <p>In this state of love, you feel connected and at one with all aspects of your environment. With practice you will learn to sustain a consistent state of moment-by-moment, manageable 'highness'. </p> <p>Examine your behaviour of late. If you've been overly cynical, pessimistic or downright nasty, you might wish to experiment with the following perceptual reframing technique. </p> <p>Greet everyone you meet with the thought: 'I am willing to look beyond the role this person is playing and love them rather than fear them.' </p> <p>It's an experiment, requiring you to temporarily suspend your belief system. Don't judge the results before the three days are up. Simply repeat the thought as often as you can remember, regardless of whether you think you mean it or not. The likely outcome will be enough of a taste of the t'ai chi reality to inspire you further. </p> <p><b> Your questions answered</b></p> <p>Dear Barefoot, I've been waking up tired and remaining so through the day. I've also been putting on weight but haven't been eating more. Can you suggest anything?<b><br> Susan Murphy, North Yorkshire</b> </p> <p>This could indicate a spleen energy deficit. The spleen (according to Oriental physiology) regulates both weight and the strength of your blood. Pinch the skin on the back of your hand and release it. If it leaves a white mark, ie if the blood doesn't return quickly, it's likely you're anaemic and should visit a GP. It sounds like you need to be more sanguine. Munch on watercress, as this is one of the best ways to get a quick iron fix. Try Floradix natural tonic as well. Include millet in your diet to strengthen the spleen, and visit a shiatsu specialist to stimulate your spleen manually. </p> <p> Barefoot Doctor: I'm only in my late twenties, spend a lot of time every day on my feet and am starting to develop varicose veins in my legs. Is there anything I can do to prevent it worsening?<br><b> Karen Wilkins, Newcastle</b> </p> <p>Practitioners of Chinese medicine attribute to the spleen, the function of holding the blood in your vessels. Varicose veins indicate a spleen energy deficiency, which can be remedied somewhat by visiting a Chinese herbalist. Take tea or capsules of Rutin (from health food stores) regularly to increase elasticity of the blood vessels. Lymphatic drainage massage can also be effective as well as yogically stretching your hamstrings, calves and quadriceps to ease constriction around the blood vessels. Additionally, practise inverted yoga postures or simply sit with your legs higher than your hips for a while each evening after work to aid the veins in transporting the blood back towards the heart. </p> <p> Dear Doc, I've been suffering from piles for a few months. They get worse when I'm tired or stressed. I'm particularly stressed at work at the moment and wonder if you know any quick fixes. <b><br>Mr I Robertson, Purley, Surrey</b> </p> <p>Piles are a form of prolapse which occurs when your spleen energy (normally responsible for holding things up against the pull of gravity) is out of adjustment. The quickest fix I know of is to boil cabbage every morning and drink a glass of the juice. Visit an acupuncturist who will probably insert a needle in the crown of your head to encourage your energy to rise and pull things up into place. Avoid rich food and alcohol and don't spend too much time sitting on the loo. Apply homeopathic haemorrhoid ointment regularly. </p> <p> Stephen Russell is author of 'Handbook for the Urban Warrior' and teaches Taoism, meditation, Chinese medicine and t'ai chi.

  "<p><strong> Contact</strong> Through your independent financial adviser </p> <p><strong> Aim </strong> To provide a tax efficient alternative to with-profits bonds, including the option of regular income withdrawals. </p> <p><strong> Bells &amp; whistles</strong> The bond provides capital protection for 95 per cent of the investment, plus the chance to benefit from returns linked to the performance of five stockmarket indices. </p> <p><strong> How it works</strong> Your money is invested in SLI's Protected Worldwide With Bonus fund. This fund is linked to five major stockmarket indices worldwide. At the start of each quarter, about 93 per cent of your investment is put in a deposit account earning interest. The remainder is used to buy options in each of the stockmarket indices. At the same time, SLI announces five predetermined bonuses - one for each index. After three months, a full bonus will be added to your investment for every index that has not fallen. You will also receive a partial bonus for an index which has fallen by less than 5 per cent. If the index has fallen by more than 5 per cent, you lose the money invested in that particular index's option. The most you can lose in any quarter is 5 per cent. </p> <p><strong> Minimum </strong> \u00a315,000, additional investments \u00a31,500. </p> <p><strong> Charges </strong> An annual charge of 1.6 per cent for the first five years, plus an annual management charge of 1.25 per cent. </p> <p><strong> Tax </strong> The Bond is based offshore in the Isle of Man, so any bonuses can be rolled up tax free, but will be taxed at your relevant rate of income tax when brought into the UK. You can withdraw up to 5 per cent of your original investment as income every year, deferring any tax liability for 20 years. </p> <p><strong> Risk</strong> Low risk </p> <p><strong> Should you invest?</strong> Kim North of London independent financial adviser Pretty Technical Partnership thinks the bond is very attractive for cautious investors. 'With profits bonds are having a hard time and there are few other avenues for risk-averse investors to get any kind of returns. But it would take a global markets melt down to lose 5 per cent with this product.' </p> <p>Amanda Davidson of London firm Holden Meehan, however, thinks the minimum premium and charges are high, and the product far too complicated for ordinary investors to digest. 'While I understand that an investor would be very unlucky indeed for all the indices to fall by more than 5 per cent in any quarter, because the protection is reset every three months it actually means you can lose up to 20 per cent a year - a lot for a cautious investor to stomach.' </p> <p><strong> Points out of 10</strong> North - 8, Davidson - 4.</p>",
  "<p>Recovery funds are dead, long live recovery funds. That is to be the chant from M &amp; G, which is asking holders of its recovery unit trust to approve changes in its investment policy. </p> <p>On the face of it, the changes are minor. It is adding the option to buy companies 'whose future prospects are not fully recognised by the market' to its existing policy of buying companies which are in difficulty or out of favour. It is removing the requirement to sell following recovery or re-rating. And it now says that it will invest 'primarily' in such companies. </p> <p>The changes will make a big difference to the composition of the fund. They will give the manager scope to invest in a far wider range of shares, allow him to run with the winning shares and to invest in some of the racier areas of the stockmarket. </p> <p>The changes were prompted by the appointment of Tom Dobell as manager. But it also recognises that the recent pedestrian performance was at least partly caused by its restricted investment criteria. </p> <p>Launched in 1969, it is one of the oldest unit trusts around. Anyone lucky enough to have invested \u00a31,000 when it launched would now be sitting on \u00a3191,200. Later investors have been less lucky, however. Over the last 10 years, it ranked 141st out of 161 trusts in its sector and over the last year it comes in 258th of 301. </p> <p>Looking at its composition, that is hardly surprising. Technology stocks, despite remaining among the best performers over the last five years, account for less than 2 per cent of its portfolio while cyclical services, such as retailers and leisure companies, account for 25 per cent. </p> <p>John Hatherly, head of global analysis for the firm, says the aim is to 'reinvigorate and refresh' the recovery style and make its performance less volatile. Dobell's background has been in small company stocks so investors should expect the proportion of the fund invested in these - and particularly in technology - to increase. </p> <p>The changes may make the fund's performance less volatile in the medium-term. Short-term however, volatility could actually increase as the managers alter the portfolio to fit the new remit so new investors may prefer to wait a few months. </p> <p>Existing investors have to vote on the changes on 23 August. It would be sensible to support them.</p>",
  "The Edinburgh Festival is more than its sum total, an effervescence, an explosion, a raging torrent of need, a need for fusion, an alarm call or a call to arms. It's a massive shout against the turgid slime of materialism in the arts: TV comedy shows, sitcoms, formula movies, money-motivated mulch for morons. <p>Like a huge tide of sweat, the great, rolling mass of culture-starved humanity filters though every room, cavern, hall, church. Yes indeed, for now the empty cavernous churches, once thinly populated and sermonised by the shrill voices of dull dutifuls, are packed and restored to the church - the church of the stage. </p> <p>Yes, there is in this Festival an element of the preacher, the divulger of valued thoughts; the dissenter; lamentations on the state of man; burning issues; contentious views, passionate beliefs. We are gathered together to bond our values, to weave a giant tapestry of beliefs. </p> <p>The Festival, the guts and viscera of the Festival, is generally now in the Fringe, even in the street. Not in the subsidised, well-heeled, polished product which has succeeded in other cities, well-honed, well-reviewed, audience-tested and worthy, like a product off the assembly line. </p> <p>The real Festival is made for the audience, to be tested and tasted by those who lay eyes on it mainly for the first time. The real Festival is cooked and finished under the scrutinising eyes of thousands, either done to a turn or scorched out of existence. </p> <p>For the real Festival, it is best to be a virgin, offering yourself for the first time, gift offerings carrying all the greater risks and excitement by exposing yourself to the Festival audience. </p> <p>These are the most varied, eclectic, curious audiences in the world, since there is no audience like the Edinburgh Festival audi ence. So, ideally, you must open here with pumping heart, sweaty brow, unfinished, not quite ready, allowing the people to tell you how it is best polished and shaped. So you offer your audienece the raw, not the pre-cooked. </p> <p>You invoke the compassion of the audience and their confirmation and identification of heart. Like pilgrims, we come offering our wares, our sacred thoughts. </p> <p>It's not London, or even the provinces. It's nothing to do with money, begging, guilt of neglect, or directors' dream visions. This is stripped-down theatre, bare of revolves, sets, flying idiots and stars. This is empty space. The actor is the messenger, not the director, and not the smart neophyte, not the fashionable playwright, but the messenger pounding on to the stage. </p> <p>Of course, the director has a place, but the right place. Not the sole place. Here can at last be revealed the actor. Stripped down. Bare. Unadorned. Unshackled. Hercules unchained. You have nothing to lose but your chains... </p> <p>On Monday morning, we enter the Assembly Rooms for the first time and check the space. </p> <p>We are forced to fight for the precious area of the stage since, unbelievably, much of it is used for storing the junk, props and detritus of the other shows. </p> <p>Naturally we carry nothing and have to pay the price. </p> <p>Eventually, we manage to claim our territory. A few lights are rigged up. Our environment is the set, our team of players and the music. We rehearse Messiah and it starts to come to life in its new setting, like a beast trembling in its crucible. </p> <p>The acoustics ring the voices back. Since so many shows follow us in the assembly belt of Edinburgh, we are racing against time. Always time - costumes time, rehearsal time, lighting time - and yet the play is slowly put together and it starts to breathe. </p> <p>On Tuesday morning, the audience file in at the unearthly hour of 11.30am and sit expectantly. </p> <p>Christ walks on the stage carrying his piece of wood. He stands in a beam of light. The first performance begins...</p>",
  "<p>I can't prove it, but taking the children on holiday must surely be right up there among the top five triggers for mental torment along with divorce, moving house, running out of toilet paper, and not being left any money following the sudden death of a well off relative. Of course, everyone puts a brave face on it for the sake of the holiday snaps, and we do make a point of bringing back hand-tooled plaster reproductions of Mount Snowdon for people with less fortunate taste than ourselves, and sending postcards to our mums joking about the typhoon that hilariously turned our caravan upside down while we were out trying to find a McDonald's in Brittany. That's all part of the fun. I'm not saying it can't be fun. The problem is... well, it's not exactly relaxing, is it? </p> <p>Gone are the days when you might have spent the afternoon vegetating on a sun lounger with a chilled margarita and the Daily Mirror , or wandering around the Uffizi catching up on neoclassicism, or perhaps tramping the dappled byways of the Dordogne, sojourning at a homely auberge for a spot of boeuf, burgundy, bed, brioche and non-reproductive sexual intercourse. But that was then. </p> <p>Now we are parents. It turns out that children don't much like sitting around reading yesterday's papers or being enlightened on the system of arts patronage under the Medicis or being taken on long walks with nothing to look at but haystacks. They're forever wanting you to make sandcastles or get wet in a variety of ways or watch them skim pebbles. And while it's true that there's about five minutes in your life when your first baby can still pass as hand luggage and it is theoretically possible to eat in a restaurant without stopping to breastfeed or wipe the sick off your shoulder, your days are numbered. This year the Amalfi coast, next year Bournemouth. </p> <p>My wife's friend's sister Carol, a newly single parent who has just got back from 10 days in Norfolk with Bella, her two-year-old daughter, says: 'What I miss are those warm, balmy evenings strolling around some small mediterranean town, deciding where to eat, dropping into a bar for an aperitif... just being able to chill out. I used to be quite snooty about English seaside holidays,' she adds, 'but it's surprising how quickly you can get used to windbreaks and deckchairs and sand in your food - and it is less hassle than going abroad for me at the moment.' </p> <p>Carol shared a cottage with her single-parent friend Janine and Janine's toddler Dennis. 'I had this mad idea that it would be a bit of a girls' holiday together - Janine's parents came for the first weekend and I thought they might babysit, but they went out to the pub instead! And Bella and Dennis didn't get on very well. Bella kept hitting Dennis with her tennis racket and stealing his toys, which made me tense, but then he'd be forever standing on the table or getting yoghurt on the sofa. I did think Janine could have been a fraction more hands-on, but what could I say?You know how it gets if you're even minutely critical of someone else's parenting techniques. Dennis would be allowed to stay up till midnight, whereas I'd normally put Bella to bed at eight, which was impossible with Dennis still running around. And Bella was still getting me out of bed at 6.30 every morning, so I was getting the worst of both worlds. I came back needing another holiday. </p> <p>'But it was fun too,' she adds. 'We did sometimes manage to get the two of them to play together while we sunbathed or had a coffee. And with the grandparents there for a couple of days, it was nice to be part of a strange hybrid family. I did feel Bella was at least getting some experience of a typical ghastly English holiday.' </p> <p>But going away with another family can numb the pain, especially if you have more children than they do. This year we took our four to Devon for a week with our old neighbours and chums John and Fiona, who have just the one cool, together, undemanding 12-year-old daughter, Harriet. Of course they are used to a less frenzied pace of life than us, but they soon got used to being woken up at dawn by our three-year-old, and didn't seem to mind the ambient whining soundtrack and new bulk cooking rota. Being in a spacious, well-resourced environment helped, especially one with its own corkscrew. Because we did manage to salvage the later part of our evenings to sit around drinking and making fun of John's range of surfwear. Fiona, who is a primary school teacher and accustomed to blocking out peripheral noise, read her usual eight books during our stay. Even I got to page 28 of Philip Roth's American Pastoral, which is a quite dense novel, chiefly about gloves. </p> <p>The days, however, were full of not sitting down. It was all right for John, who enjoys nothing more than splashing about in a frogman's outfit and discovering his inner child. I have no inner child. Just outer ones. 'You shouldn't expect to relax,' says my wife. 'The holiday is for the children. Think of them.' </p> <p>She's right, of course. I ought to be getting the hang of it by now. The thing is, it doesn't matter how many hours you spend watching them hold their breath underwater or how much money you give them to waste on machines, they'll always discover something they haven't moaned about yet. Do holidays have to be so fraught with anxiety? Are they like Christmas in that respect? </p> <p>Dorothy Rowe, the psychologist, writer, and something of an expert on things that get you down, says: 'Holidays can be very challenging. You can get bored, the kids are difficult, perhaps someone gets ill. You're in an unfamiliar environment. Holidays are supposed to be wonderful, but a lot of kids would rather be at home where they know what's what. It's up to adults to make it work, but then it's down to adults when things go wrong. That's what parents are for - for the children to blame.' </p> <p>'It's all a bit depressing,' I say. </p> <p>'Depression is something else,' she says. 'But it can be very dispiriting.' </p> <p>And, as Louise and Nick (not their real names) have discovered in the last couple of years, there's nothing like having a surly teenager in the family to make things worse. 'If you don't get it right, it can be an absolute nightmare,' says Louise, who has two boys, eight and 10, and Gemma, 15. 'The boys are easy to please and Nick is very good at getting any nearby children together for football or rounders. But we can't expect Gemma to play rounders now. She'd just hang around scowling and being difficult for two weeks and wanting to go home - or, worse, to a fairground.' The answer, says Louise, is to a) go abroad so Gemma can at least hold her head up at school - France is ideally situated, being right next door to Britain; b) book into a large, raucous Eurocamp or similar with a nightly disco and boys with earrings and tattoos; c) open a bottle of Chablis. </p> <p>This year the family went to a site near Bordeaux - the same place they went last year. 'Both times Gemma has made friends with other teenagers. After the first day we hardly saw her, because she was out enjoying herself and being independent. She loved it. This year we let her invite a friend from school along, which was better for her, though slightly worse for us, in terms of privacy and space. But I suppose we're beginning to realise that every holiday she has with us now could be her last.' </p> <p>My wife says we should enjoy the children while we can. Of course, she agrees that holidays can drive you scatty but she says they provide a family with a history of shared memories. They are like magical milestones on the highway of routine. Okay, she didn't actually say that last bit. But it's true that we do still talk about the trout that our eldest caught in France, and the bats that lived behind the shutters, and Bridget the camel in Tunisia and how the youngest lost his shoe in the souk and how our little trio of cuties won the fancy dress as mice in the Isle of Wight. </p> <p>And the funny thing is... I can't seem to remember any of the bad bits.</p>",
  "<p>He calls himself 'the happy environmentalist', making it sound like the title of a fairy story. Sitting in the living-room of his beautiful house in Cheltenham - light floating in through the tall, clean windows; on the shelves books, children's videos, board games; on the cream walls two square, bright paintings of blue skies and blue seas; all around the room photographs of his two daughters smiling, his wife smiling, himself smiling from under his locks of dark hair - this seems a world of well-tempered tranquillity, prosperous contentment and a particularly English ease. </p> <p>Yet the worlds Jonathon Porritt deals with are, as he says himself, ones of 'deep gloom and darkest dismay', where the news is very rarely good and often apocalyptic: poisoned beaches, toxic air, leaking gases, endangered species, a torn sky, a dangerous sun. So, he says, 'happiness can seem such an illegitimate emotion; optimism strange amid such deep, dark gloom. Happiness is quite psychologically complicated for someone like me. A lot of my friends are worn down by the literal despair that they feel at living with this pattern of destruction. In the face of dire news, people may easily become paralysed and feel powerless.' He smiles with great charm. 'Not me. I have never felt despair. I remain an optimist. You see, I think I can change things - still, even now, I think I can change what is happening.' </p> <p>Jonathon Porritt has just been appointed by Tony Blair as the Government's key adviser on sustainable development; he will chair the 15-strong Sustainable Development Committee. He's rather modest, and mildly rueful, about his new position, which he calls 'a monstrous challenge'. He doesn't think that he was their first choice. 'In fact, I wasn't even a candidate at all,' he says. 'I've never had any internal dealings with the Labour Party. I've always been critical of them. I have not sought to defend this party's record, and I won't begin doing that now. I'm not going to be suddenly going, \"oooh, I got it all wrong, all along\". I've always been dark green and radical. Now here I am on the inside, or sort of. I have to report on the Government's performance on sustainable development, and you can't be on the inside doing that. You can't be too close, or there would be no usefulness in it for them; no credibility for others. I nailed that down with Michael Meacher, whom I have always admired. It will be a critical dialogue.' </p> <p>When he was invited to do the job, he was 'very surprised indeed. I said, \"I'm still a member of the Green Party, you know\". They said, \"no problem\". I said, \"what if I campaign for the radical greenies at the next election?\" They said, \"well, it might sit a mite uneasily; this is an independent body\". I said, \"what if I make critical speeches about the Government?\" They said, \"Jonathon, that's part of your job\".' He thinks that he can be outside and inside, all at once. </p> <p>In fact, that's pretty much what he's been all of his working life: inside and outside, establishment and radical, friend to the powerless and to the Prince of Wales. He was born to be a Sir - his father, who died eight years ago, was Baron Porritt of Wanganui and Hampstead. He was educated at Eton, where he was 'very happy; I had a wonderful time, I'm afraid - my whole childhood was very happy and untroubled... no torments there'. </p> <p>He went to Oxford, where he obtained a first-class degree in modern languages. His sister works in finance; his brother is a property developer. Nothing prepared him for being an environmental activist and a thorn in the side of the establishment to which he belongs by birth and manner, except for his childhood love of wildlife. After Oxford, he started training as a barrister, but it bored him, so he spent the next 10 years teaching at a London comprehensive, during which time he became active in the Green Party, becoming its co-chair in 1980. </p> <p>He left teaching and the chair of the Green Party (which by then was a wrangling and rivalrous organisation headed towards its Sara Parkin farrago) to become director of Friends of the Earth, which he built up into the face of 'respectable radicalism', firmly grounded in science and fact and setting its face against wacky and mystical environmentalism. He has written books on environmental issues, presented television series on them; he has chaired the United Nations environmental and development committee for the UK. In 1996, he became a founder and director of Forum for the Future, a charity campaigning for solutions to today's environmental problems. The Forum tends to highlight good news rather than pointing out the bad, and its members include Richard Rogers, Jonathan Dimbleby and Will Hutton. A lot of its work is done with large companies - if Friends of the Earth was a bottom-up organisation, Forum for the Future is a top-down one. </p> <p>The great and the good, I say, and he smiles at the buried question mark. </p> <p>'This conflict has been true all my life. I don't see it as a tension, but as a set of opportunities. I have always felt that. The fact that I know how the establishment world works, because I was born into it and educated into it, has not been a disadvantage to me or the organisations I've worked with. The opposite is true: it has helped me to do much more useful work. At Friends of the Earth, being at ease with the people who were on the inside track, in the corridors of power, it was plain useful for us. I could take this radical message to people who simply wouldn't have listened to others, but who would listen to me. </p> <p>'I'm upfront about this. I've used my privilege to get greater leverage for green ideas. I've done it calculatingly. I have turned it to good effect. It's not complicated for me. I feel no guilt.' He adds, after a pause, that it is, however, 'much too easy to forget what it is like to be powerless and to have no voice. I am familiar with worlds where people don't just forget - they have never known. They are blind to injustice, inequality, poverty. Things are genuinely invisible to them'. </p> <p>But he insists that 'that is absolutely not true for me. I will not allow myself to forget what my work is about and be seduced by power. I just won't. I still feel the same way about it as I did when I started. I can remember the first impulse as clearly as yesterday. I am,' he continues, 'an environmentalist not because I care about Nature, which I very much do, but because I care more about the human species. I care about things like social justice, fairness, equality, human potential - and survival. Part of the quality of life is our relationship with the natural world. Diminish that and we diminish ourselves. There are other activists who start from the other way round - that what matters is the natural world. Well, I think I have a huge sense of its spiritual significance. My attitude is not just utilitarian. But I see nature through a human lens.' He laughs: 'Anyway, you should try talking about spiritual things at Friends of the Earth; they'd shout you down in a blaze of materialistic fury. They are a rationalist, instrumentalist organisation. That's why they are so effective; they don't get cluttered up with, you know, stuff.' </p> <p>He respects science, but only so far. Poetry creeps into his analyses. He is scornful of scientists such as Richard Dawkins, and his anti-religious, absolutist fervour. He hates the great divide between scientists and the rest of us - C.P. Snow's famous two cultures, and the yawning gap between them; the hole into which the world will fall. His latest book, Playing Safe: Science and the Environment (Thames and Hudson) contains a wealth of scientific information about the parlous state of the natural word, but also several swipes at arrogant scientists and their assumption that science is authoritative, objective, value-free and the last word. </p> <p>He was one of the people who turned Friends of the Earth into a respectable, science-led place, but he bemoans its dry-eyed materialism. He loves James Lovelock and the Gaia principle; he calls for holistic solutions; he approves of the Prince of Wales's dogged championing of 'the sacred'; he can't stand media cynics; he talks about cosmic harmony and psychic disconnection, and about synthetic chemicals and sewerage systems. The world for him is not just a great rock but a 'whispering pond'. </p> <p>'I do believe in a world that is a created world and not just an accident. God is probably the best word to describe that force. Well, I know it doesn't correlate much with what most people mean by God. And since I don't believe you can have a pick'n'mix Christianity, then I'd probably subscribe to the Christian faith. But as a Christian, I'd better tell you I fail on every count. I don't, for a start, believe in life after death. I do believe in reincarnation, by which I mean a literal, physical reincarnation, so that when we die we are promptly recycled into a million different organisms.' </p> <p>In other words, he believes in decay. 'Yes. I love the thought. It thrills me. It turns me on. I revel in the idea that I'll be incorporated back into the world like that. I love the idea of being buried in a grove, a tree growing out of my heart. I'm not at all scared of death. Even less after seeing my father die. He was 92, after all, but none the less, he was very gentle, very accepting. We talked a lot about his death, and he thought there was nothing you needed to make a fuss about. I don't worry about dying at all.' </p> <p>So where are the things that trip him up? 'Hmmm. Well, getting a balance. Some things have fallen by the way in my life. In my early adulthood, I had a really strong network of friends. I felt passionately about friendship. That's gone, if I'm honest. I've sacrificed that to family and work - I work tremendously hard in the week, and I spend every weekend with my family and I protect my space with them; that always takes priority. But I worry about friendships; it troubles me.' </p> <p>Other things, he says, do not trouble him. He is lucky, cheerful, optimistic. Environmental work creates 'fear, guilt, anger. It touches on the darkest places of your psyche. And I've worked there all my life, but I do not feel despair. And now, with the Forum and its emphasis on best practice, I work with other things - like joy, fulfilment, success. It taps into other parts of human energy. And I think, I really do, that in some ways things are getting better. The pattern of destruction, well, the news remains uniformly bad, and often getting worse. But in terms of awareness, things are better. It's an area that is not so measurable, but I believe there's a growing commitment to changed behaviour, and a readiness for change. It's very different from the Eighties, let alone the Seventies.' </p> <p>There's such joy, he says, in the business of protecting the earth. 'It's not a crabby, grim business at all. The essence of it is joy.' If he ever does get a bit depressed at the enormity of the task, 'I just get out there, into nature. I reconnect.' He chuckles. 'I hug those trees. I'm very flaky, you know. God knows what the Government's done. Appointed a complete flake. </p> <p>'Maybe what I'll do after this is to start chaining myself to railings again. I'd like that sense of life being a cycle. I could loop round, back to where I started. Into the corridors of power and out the other side, chained to the railings and shouting for change.'</p>",
  "<p>Although he presents himself as an environmentalist guru, Al Gore has always been enthusiastic about genetically modified 'Frankenfoods' - and for many good reasons. One might be that he himself is a GM product. No man in the history of American politics can have been so carefully and deliberately groomed, moulded, deconstructed and reconstructed for the Presidential race for which Al 'GM' Gore presents himself at the Democrat convention, opening in Los Angeles tomorrow. </p> <p>When Gore arrived for his first day as a journalist on the Nashville Tennessean newspaper in the autumn of 1971, most staff knew he was no regular cub reporter. Gore was being packaged to them as the young man who had just returned from his stint in Vietnam - wearing his country's uniform although he bitterly criticised its war - now making his way in the world free from the overbearing family tradition of politics. In contrast to the cynical realpolitik practiced by his father, Senator Albert Gore I, Al Gore II had studied esoteric spiritualism. He was a decent enough reporter too - he pursued a local corruption case all the way to a court hearing (although the target was acquitted). </p> <p>But the package was a deceptive one. Had he really wanted to go into journalism, the Harvard-educated Gore could have walked into other, more prestigious newsrooms than that which happened to have been in his father's political back-pocket in Nashville. The editor of the Nashville Tennessean was John Siegenthaler, who employed celebrity interns who would enhance his own contacts in Washington. </p> <p>In Vietnam, Gore's father had been able to pull a few strings (although without such sordid efficiency as George Bush's) and secured Gore a job as an army reporter. Accordingly, he had been mollycoddled around, a safe distance from the action which he reported in vivid detail from second-hand accounts. 'Gore was not the journalist type,' recalls his former colleague on the desk, Phil Sullivan. 'It didn't seem like that was what he was setting out to do. Siegenthaler saw him as someone who was going into politics.' </p> <p>But although his colleagues knew exactly what he was up to, Gore himself could have had no idea that the more relaxed and apparently self-confident summer intern sitting at the next desk would, in two decades time, be the man to whom he would turn for yet another in the long series of makeovers that would define his career: Carter Eskew, 'message guru' of the current campaign, laboratory technician of the present-day GM Gore and Svengali of the LA convention. </p> <p>It is hard to know which aspects of Al Gore's life are fact and which are fanciful, or indeed whether there is any difference between the two. Gore himself plays along with the entwinement, turning even the rawest and most intimate moments of his life - such as his own son's scrape with death in a car accident - into theatrics, part of the electoral strategy. </p> <p>The packaging of Al Gore as President of the United States began when he was still in utero. On the day Gore was born, the Nashville Tennessean hailed the birth on page one: 'Well, Mr Gore, Here He Is', with the Knoxville News Sentinel adding only a year or two later: 'There may be another Gore on his way to the political pinnacle.' </p> <p>Gore grew up not in Tennessee but in what is now the Ritz Carlton Hotel on Embassy Row in Washington DC, attending an \u00e9lite prep school and spending summers on the tobacco farm in his father's home state. He played with a toy submarine in the Senate swimming-pool and bounced on President Nixon's lap. Albert Snr was a rags-to-riches, Scots-Irish politician, a New Dealer unafraid of unpopular positing and ultimately defeated after an 18-year career only when Nixon unleashed a slush of illegal finance against him, as revealed by the Watergate papers. Like his son, he enjoyed taking the ethical high ground and like his son he betrayed it. But it was Gore's mother, Pauline, who claimed the initial packaging of her son - 'I trained them both,' she said of Alberts I and II, 'and I did a better job on my son than I did on my husband.' </p> <p>The most striking thing about packaging Al Gore is the regularity with which it happens and the extent of the metamorphoses. The most dramatic was the apparent conversion from new-age eco-catastrophist to Vice-President in 1992 and, more recently, from a woodentop with as much political razzmatazz as a traffic jam to something from Sopranos central casting. </p> <p>The task in 1992 was particularly daunting and almost effective. Gore pre sented a curious figure at the time, as expressed in his book, Earth in the Balance . It was published at a time when politicians were full of foreboding about the various apocalypses of global warming, over-population and ozone-depletion and making routine pilgrimages to the Amazon rainforest. </p> <p>Gore had been understandably affected by his son's narrow scrape with death after a car hit the child as the family was leaving a Baltimore Orioles baseball game. He had immersed himself in alternative psychotherapy, new-age thought and the fad philosophy of Gaia, popular among right-wing eco-catastrophists, suggesting that the human race is merely part of a single, natural organism. </p> <p>'It cannot be accidental,' wrote Gore in one of his more wayward passages, 'that the percentage of salt in our bloodstreams is the same as the percentage in the oceans of the world.' Gore laments mankind's alienation from this natural order, putting the blame squarely on Ren\u00e9 Descartes. Quite apart from its intellectual absurdity, Gore's position had two curiosities: the fact that it did not put off the embryonic Clinton administration and its brazen disingenuousness. </p> <p>On his 1998 tax return, Al Gore lists a $20,000 royalty payment from the Union Zinc Company for the right to mine zinc on his farm in Tennessee. The income, which has netted Gore $450,000 over the years, is the legacy of Gore Snr's lucrative relationship and joint ventures with fraudulent tycoon and Soviet agent, Armand Hammer, also chief executive of the environmentally controversial Occidental Petroleum Company. Among other ironies, Hammer was caught making illegal contributions to Nixon, used to topple Gore Snr. Hammer and Gore Snr enjoyed a two-way deal: Hammer boasted that he had Gore in his 'back-pocket'; he found protection from anti-communist investigations and open doors in Washington; Gore Snr secured campaign funds, a six-figure directorship upon retirement and donations for his son's Congressional campaigns. </p> <p>After hosting Gore and Tipper at innumerable parties, and being Al's guest at Ronald Reagan's inauguration in 1987, Hammer died in 1990. But the $20,000 a year was a handsome supplement to what Gore complained were 'slave wages' on the Tennessean , and still listed in 1992 as his most important source of income after his salary, now eclipsed by the $1.1 million in royalties from Earth in the Balance . </p> <p>The relationship between Gore and Occidental has remained a mutually advantageous one. Occidental loaned $100,000 to the Clinton-Gore inaugural committee in 1992, and has donated some $500,000 in 'soft money' to the Democratic Party since Gore made it on to the ticket. </p> <p>This was the administration-in-waiting that decided it needed Al Gore on the ticket. When he took the initial call from scout Warren Christopher, Gore was attending the Rio Earth Summit in 1991, waving his copy of Earth in the Balance . Baby-boomer Clinton liked the generational chemistry with Gore, and the Vietnam 'record' which, on paper, contrasted with his own. Gore appealed to the 'new Democrat' right wing for a number of reasons. He had been recruited by the party as an attack dog to see off Jesse Jackson's candidacy in 1988 and had done a good enough job. Even then, Clinton also needed someone with a stable marriage to offset his embarrassment over Gennifer Flowers. </p> <p>Gore was duly put through the mill, drilled into shape even by people who disliked him at the political core of Clinton's campaign: Hillary, James Carville and George Stephanopoulos. He was worked over by speech coaches and a ballet choreographer, who counselled him on his awkward movements. The wrathful impatience with conventional politics sketched in Earth in the Balance was silenced as the book became the first ever bestseller that a publisher refrained from pushing. Clinton liked the volume, but Carville, Harold Ickes and the realists on the party's Left, trying to win an election, found it insane at best, scary at worst. Gore the Rainbow Warrior duly became Gore the Vice-President. </p> <p>But what kind of packaging was it? The nadir of Gore's life-as-theatre came at the party convention in New York that year, Gore's 'coming-out' event. He told the delegates and viewing millions how he had watched Albert Gore III 'fly 30 feet through the air and scrape along the pavement... I ran to his side and held him and called his name... his eyes were open with the nothingness state of death'. Gore was reading every word off the autocue. </p> <p>The history of Vice-Presidents assuming the top office is a patchy one, as Pauline Gore must have realised when she expressed coded disapproval of her son's supporting role to the 'provincial' Bill Clinton. It was a concept in promotion pioneered by the shock of Truman's takeover from Franklin Roosevelt and L.B.J.'s even more dramatic succession of J.F. Kennedy, but these were without preparation. It worked differently in the more ambitious cases of Nixon, first of the 'modern' Vice-Presidents, and George Bush. </p> <p>A year ago, a lifetime of grooming 'Veep' Al Gore for the presidency seemed doomed to failure. A bumper sticker appeared: 'Stuck in Traffic? Blame Al Gore'. Gore had creased the nation's sides by telling CNN's Wolf Blitzer he had 'taken the initiative in creating the internet'. Hillary Clinton's candidacy in New York created a Medusan triangle inside the White House with resentments in all directions. Most importantly, Gore was making instantly and utterly forgettable speeches: 'Gore' was spelled with a 'B'. </p> <p>A Wagnerian family psychodrama was playing out between Clinton and Gore - 'father' and 'son' - which was, with hindsight, crucial to Gore's selection of running mate last week. Throughout the Lewinsky scandal, Gore had walked a high wire between loyalty and disgust. Apart from Hillary, he was the most senior victim of the President's deceit but also had the highest honour under Clinton's patronage to betray if he abandoned him. </p> <p>Gore's political father (Clinton) finally blessed Gore's ambition to become President in 1998, the year that his actual father died, thereby turning Clinton's political paternity into something more complex. Gore always knew that his success lay in the passing of power by both to him, as George Bush Snr has done to his son. But there was a problem - the motives of both Gore's father figures were entirely narcissistic. One wanted a President Gore who would bear the family name in the White House, the other a President Gore to rescue his legacy from the stains on Monica's dress. </p> <p>In his hour of need, Gore was shunned by the surrogate father in a way he never was by Albert Snr. Out of the blue, Clinton made an unsolicited call to the New York Times, making clear his displeasure at the way Gore was conducting his campaign. On the morning his remarks were published, the atmosphere in Gore's White House office was one of 'stunned disbelief'. Meanwhile, down the corridor, Gore had been shut out of the huddle that gathered around the President to discuss the advisability and fallout of the Times interview. Gore's retort came sharp enough. He told Diane Sawyer he thought Clinton's behaviour during the Lewinsky scandal had been 'inexcusable... especially as a father'. </p> <p>Gore assembled a team with specific instructions - to repackage him again, almost from scratch. One source told The Observer that Gore himself even admitted privately that 'I would not vote for the Al Gore I read about'. A war council was convened by the new campaign director, Tony Coelho, a former Congressman dogged by allegations of embezzlement and scandal, to do just that. With Coelho was Bob Shrum, former wordsmith for Teddy Kennedy who will have written Gore's sink-or-swim Los Angeles speech; Gore's daughter, Karenna Gore Schriff, and wife, Tipper; Eskew and stringent political director Donna Brazile, who acted as pastor and conscience to the otherwise devious bunch. </p> <p>According to one present at the meeting, the message was to 'free Gore from his office and from the White House' - to declare UDI from Bill and Hillary. Gore moved his campaign headquarters from Washington to his supposed 'roots' in Tennessee. The move was also a good way to cull a troubled, squabbling staff, to sort out the wheat prepared to sacrifice everything to follow him from the chaff who preferred to stay around their DC dinner tables. Brazile added a trial by salary, cutting everybody's by two-thirds. Gore and his senior staff remained in the comfort of Washington. </p> <p>Diane Sawyer conducted the first TV interview in Tennessee with Gore and Tipper on his late father's tobacco farm. Gore wore jeans and cowboy boots. Sawyer threw the first pitch, a fastball. Her grandmother, she said, who was in tobacco farming, wanted to ask: how many strains of tobacco are there in the US? Gore stared back blankly, a look of wounded hatred in his eyes. The second question was about the maintenance of fencing between two properties; Gore was equally clueless. </p> <p>Addressing the crowds at his launch rally in Tennessee, Gore pledged to 'take my own values of faith and family to the Presidency' and promised: 'If you entrust me with the Presidency, I will marshal its authority, its resources and its moral leadership to fight for America's family.' It was a brazen slap in Clinton's face. Gore's campaign hit the road with speeches luxuriating in the strong economy, but barely mentioning Clinton. He needed to share in the President's public successes (and stubborn popularity among Americans) while denouncing his private failings. </p> <p>Winter came, and the packaging team devised a new, folksy Al Gore who stopped talking about 'livability' and held town meetings and his audience to raise their hands until he had identified who had the most grandchildren. As the jester of American politician-watching, Professor Todd Gitlin at New York University, puts it: 'The difference between Bush and Gore now is that Bush is fake trying to be real, while Gore is real trying to be fake.' </p> <p>But even the 'fake' package had trouble selling himself. Gore was tainted by the Russian money-laundering scandal. A photo opportunity in a canoe backfired when it emerged that 170 million gallons of water had been released to stage it, during a drought. Bill Bradley was making headway he simply didn't deserve. Coelho's tyrannical style was driving the team to distraction to no effect; he was hardly the Carville figure the campaign so obviously needed. There was bitter internal strife between one-time partners Eskew and the (now late) Bob Squier, policy adviser. The two men had once run a consultancy together but their combined presence on the Gore campaign was, said old White House hand Dick Morris 'like asking the Albanians and Serbs to work together'. Then came a final split from Bill, a bit of the sex appeal and the final makeover. </p> <p>The Gores had decided that marital bliss was the key to the post-Monica era, but now they added a bit of libido to their version. On stage, Tipper would summon him with a wave of her hand, saying: 'He's so sexy', and he would respond: 'I love it when she beckons me with her finger like that.' The chic feminist Naomi Wolf was recruited to refurbish Gore's wardrobe and promote his sexual chem istry from what she labelled 'Beta to Alpha' grade. </p> <p>It seemed to work. Brazile's puritanism played counterpoint to this flippancy. Gore became almost a control freak over his campaign, designing his own logos and websites. The result appeared on television during the New Hampshire primary opposite Bill Bradley. To the nation's amazement, Gore suddenly looked hunky, like a football quarterback dressed as a small-time Mafiosi. He was confident yet relaxed. </p> <p>Gore has since applied the new style to new crusades, none more virulently than that against America's drugs and medicines industry. Gore lambasts the pharmaceutical companies for 'gouging the consumer unfairly' and claims credit for a recent industry retreat in agreeing to allow South Africa and other countries to manufacture cheaper generic drugs to counter the Aids pandemic. But even this genetic modification is flawed because, as ever with Gore, it is disingenuous. Gore's claim that he pushed for the generic production of Aids medicines in South Africa is especially unconvincing. Last December, The Observer revealed the web of consultancies and lobbying that connected Gore to the major drug producers suing the South African government for trying to produce generics. </p> <p>This campaign is the final act in Gore's lifelong White House drama. The first scene has already been successfully played out: the overdue shedding of Coelho and his replacement by William Daley, a rough-cut professional and one of America's fourth dynasty after the Kennedys, Bushes, Gores, that of the past and present mayors of Chicago, Richard Daley Snr and Jr. If anyone can save Gore, it is Daley, as Gore must have known when he called him shortly after midnight to offer him the job. A groggy Daley said he'd like to think about it over a cup of coffee. 'OK,' replied Gore, 'go get your coffee and I'll hold.' </p> <p>The second scene was concluded last week with Lieberman's appointment. But this only complicates the third scene, which opens in Los Angeles tomorrow - that which is supposed to star President Al Gore, but in which President Bill Clinton will inevitably play centre stage. That was always the problem in packaging Al Gore - fathers. </p> <p>If this was Wagner, the aged, flawed Wotan would be standing at the foot of the mountain, spear in hand. Young Siegfried would slice it in half and Wotan would say: 'Pass on, for I cannot stop you.' But Al Gore Snr never taught his son how to use the sword, and neither did Bill Clinton. In the end, it was they who did the packaging, and neither was prepared, in the final hour, to be outshone by Al Gore.</p>",
  "<p> Seeing a killer whale close up in its natural surroundings is a heart-stopping moment. Of awe, not fear. It doesn't have to do anything spectacular such as leap in the air or hunt in a pack, with David Attenborough narrating. </p> <p>Simply watching this gargantuan and graceful beast glide slowly through a piercing-blue stretch of ocean is utterly thrilling. Around 100 killer whales spend all their springs and summers pursuing the wild king salmon and chilling out between meals just yards off the San Juan archipelago of tiny, lush islands not far from Seattle, at the northern end of the US Pacific coast. </p> <p>The Free Willy movies were filmed around here and the area is a real draw for nature lovers and sailors, especially those who want to watch whales. Tourists take to boats and canoes to observe the resident orca - to give killer whales their polite Latin name - or just sit on the shore with a picnic, as the whales often swim close by. </p> <p>When a group of eight of us in an open-backed cruiser chanced on a group of three killer whales it was an emotional moment. Our skipper had been about to give up and turn back to the harbour because a bone-chilling and seemingly impenetrable late-spring mist was gathering. </p> <p>But as suddenly as it had descended, the fog evaporated, just as a giant male orca bobbed its head up out of the water some distance away, looking around in what whale watchers call a 'spy hop'. Moments later two towering dorsal fins cut through the water next to the boat and a calf followed behind, breaking the surface with its body and flashing its characteristic white patches. </p> <p>The orca family was in no hurry, content to swish and dive in the millpond sea. The snow-capped Olympic Mountains formed the backdrop to the glassy ocean on one side, a hazy view of Vancouver Island, just across the Canadian border, on the other. </p> <p>It is not hard to see why the San Juan islands have become the holiday playground for burnt-out Boeing bosses and millionaire Microsoft net-heads who work for Seattle's two biggest employers. These and other urban stressballs consume the tranquillity and natural feast from their timber lodges, discreet guesthouses and yachts. There are no traffic lights, nightclubs or high-rise blocks. But there is fresh seafood, ancient woodland, crystal waters and the chance to commune with the sealions, whales, bald eagles and cormorants. </p> <p> Even getting to San Juan Island, the largest in the archipelago, is special. Trippers take off in seven-seater De Havilland Beaver seaplanes from the middle of Lake Union amid the skyscrapers of downtown Seattle. After an hour's low-level flying over Puget Sound with spectacular views of the snowy Mount Rainier volcano, the plane skims into San Juan Island's diminutive Friday Harbour. There are also ferries from the mainland. Either way it feels like arriving in paradise. </p> <p>But wonderful as it looks, there is trouble in paradise.The killer whales are under threat. An adult orca needs almost 50 kilos of salmon a day. But Bill Wright, who owns San Juan Safaris, which runs boat and canoe trips to see the whales, estimates that the region's salmon population has declined by 90 per cent in the past 100 years, with its annihilation greatly accelerated during the 'greed is good' Eighties. </p> <p>He partly blames aggressive logging in nearby Washington and Oregon states and the transformation of near-desert landscape inland into lush ranches with golf courses using thousands of gallons of water for irrigation and artificial fertilisers. These actions decimated the topsoil and filled the rivers pouring into the whales' Pacific feeding waters with silt and pesticides he said. </p> <p>In addition hydro-electric programmes have dammed many of the rivers, providing inadequate salmon 'ladders' alongside and therefore making it virtually impossible for the fish to swim upriver to their breeding grounds. Combine all that with straightforward over-fishing and it won't be long before the islanders start to lose their orcas. </p> <p>Wright is very conscious that what looks like perfection is already an illusion and that the fragile ecosystem will break down without greater protection. He said: 'Some of the worst damage was inflicted at the height of Republican economic aggression, and there was only thought for money in these parts, no thought for tomorrow and no thought for our environment.' </p> <p>The local island newspaper is full of stories of the whale population shrinking and familiar individual orcas failing to return from their winter feeding grounds. The scarcer minke and grey whales are also reportedly being spotted less frequently. </p> <p>Whale watching itself has come in for criticism. Wright is an example of a local businessman who is also an environmentalist. He makes a living taking tourists out on his cruisers and believes the orca don't mind the dozens of tourist boats from different companies that criss-cross their habitat during the summer. Boats are not allowed to drive within 100 metres of a whale and must switch their engines off in the vicinity. </p> <p> Wright said: 'I was there yesterday and some dolphins surrounded the boat for 15 minutes, leaping and diving around the hull. They were curious and obviously loving it.' </p> <p>He said that, since the hunting parties that used to come out from the Seattle area to shoot whales were banned in the Seventies, the whales were in better shape than they had been for 30 years. As well as being a leading figure in the San Juan whale watching industry, Wright is also involved in environmental and conservation movements seeking better ways to protect the orca. </p> <p>But some locals disagree that commercial whale-watching is beneficial. One boat captain said it was not uncommon to see 100 boats out in the single stretch of ocean just off San Juan Island watching the whales at the height of the season - in August. </p> <p>He said: 'When things get really busy out there I think the whales do get upset. I see mothers with calves slapping the water with their fins repeatedly. I always interpret it as the equivalent of them shaking their fist, saying \"get out of here\" to the humans,' he said. </p> <p>Others spoke of the rules governing whale watching as being too lax and poorly enforced in the area. 'There are boats coming from Vancouver Island, mainland Canada and the San Juan Islands, so there isn't one system. People try to be considerate, but it gets pretty chaotic out there at the height of the season,' said one. </p> <p>A greener alternative to the cruiser boats are the paddling trips in kayaks. As well as the chance to see whales close up in absolute silence, there is the exhilaration of paddling past the wooded island peninsulas and rocky outcrops with their resident eagles and seals. And giant starfish and anemones are visible on the seabed in the shallows. Kayaking, however, will never be the money-spinner that whale-watching boat trips are. </p> <p>The other local debate is the one about the whales and the area's Native American communities, or what this all-white enclave mostly refers to as 'Indian tribes'. Native Americans hunted and fished these waters as long as 10,000 years ago, but have long since been driven out and corralled on mainland 'reservations'. </p> <p>Lee Brooks, who runs a small Native American art and sculpture gallery at Friday Harbour, said he has listened to torrents of poisonous ranting from both islanders and visitors about the very existence of the people who produce the crafts on display. </p> <p>Some islanders blame the Native American populations in Washington State for over-exploiting their ancient fishing rights. One group has caused a storm by winning the right to kill five minke whales a year, which has prompted a local environmental protest ship to blockade their boats during the hunting season. </p> <p>Brooks said: 'The environmentalists did not want to discuss or negotiate with the Native American fishermen - there was no dialogue, just leafleting and placards.' </p> <p>He is dubious about the merits of the tourism industry that makes a fortune off the orca's graceful backs and on which the island now depends. He believes the whale-watching industry has been allowed to grow too far. </p> <p>He looked out of the gallery window disconsolately as another seaplane arrived from Seattle and a Canadian ferry docked, disgorging more pleasure seekers eager to indulge in nature's bounty. </p> <p>'The orcas are dying and time's running out to save them,' he said bitterly.</p> <p><strong>Fact file </strong></p> <p><strong>Flights</strong></p> <p>Joanna Walters travelled to Seattle with British Airways (0845 77 333 77) from Heathrow.

  "<p>UK carmakers and components suppliers were warned this weekend by a leading industry expert that they must learn to live with the high pound. </p> <p>But the Government was given notice by the expert, academic Nick Matthews, that the euro will eventually become the global currency of the motor industry, and that manufacturers will continue to suffer real financial pain as long as Britain fails to commit itself to the single currency. </p> <p>The warnings came after Toyota, which builds cars in Derbyshire and engines in north Wales, last week put further pressure on the Government to join the euro by demanding that suppliers of components sign all contracts for future new business in euros. </p> <p>This was the latest call in a catalogue of protests this summer from virtually all the companies building cars in the UK: the high value of the pound against the euro is, they insist, threatening existing factories as well as future investment in Britain. </p> <p>Toyota's announcement followed a meeting between Nissan chief Carlos Ghosn and Tony Blair at the end of last month at which the Prime Minister was warned that the Nissan plant in Sunderland did not have a future if currency imbalances meant it was not awarded the contract later this year to build the next Micra model. </p> <p>The Government has so far steadfastly refused to bend to the manufacturers' appeals either to join the euro or to commit itself unequivocally to joining, in order to encourage the pound and the euro to move closer in value. </p> <p>Matthews, senior fellow at Warwick University's international manufacturing group, said that rather than relying on the Government, carmakers and suppliers would have to 'get used' to the industry costing in euros and adapt to the environment in order to survive. </p> <p>'The aerospace industry costs in US dollars the world over, whether trading parts or whole aircraft, because the planemakers work in dollars and because North America is the leading marketplace,' he said. </p> <p>'What is happening with the motor industry is that Europe is the world's single biggest car market, and the euro is becoming the currency of the auto business.' </p> <p>European motorists buy around 16 million cars a year, ahead of North America with 12 million and the Far East with 10 million. </p> <p>Matthews said: 'It does not matter whether you currently operate with pounds, yen or dollars: the future for the industry is the euro. Everyone outside the eurozone, including the UK and places like Norway, Poland and the Czech Republic over time will be forced to cost components in euros as the norm.' </p> <p>Smaller UK component suppliers have most to lose from the large manufacturers demanding to pay in euros, as they are least flexible and all their staff and materials costs are in sterling. </p> <p>The motor industry is consolidating, with an increasing number of tie-ups between US, European and Asian manufacturers. International barriers are being broken down and companies are increasingly buying parts wherever in Europe they can get the best price, rather than remaining loyal to local suppliers. </p> <p>The carmakers will benefit from buying in the eurozone, or paying UK suppliers in euros. But British car factories are still at a disadvantage in terms of selling their cars in the UK in competition with cheaper imports, as well as trying to make profits when exporting into the eurozone. </p> <p>British car factories are less cost-effective than many of their continental counterparts because their tooling and equipment are outdated, often because of under-investment. Nissan's Sunderland plant - now more than 10 years old - is heading the same way. This means the plants cannot produce the huge variety of models that firms want to make from a single, expensive platform. </p> <p>This problem contributed to Rover's near-collapse, and to Ford's decision to stop making cars at Dagenham. </p> <p>This exacerbates the problem of Britain becoming a less attractive place for foreign-owned carmakers to invest. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Mark Schennum, vice-president at Gemini Consulting, said the UK government seemed to be 'letting the market' bring the value of sterling nearer to the euro. 'If your suppliers bill in euros, it puts downward pressure on the pound anyway,' he said. </p> <p>It would be 'political suicide' for the Government to join the euro now, because public opinion was firmly against it. </p> <p>Schennum said UK carmakers were 'undoubtedly hurting', but the Government needed to consider seriously whether the manufacturers could adjust successfully to the currency situation. </p> <p>He felt that their protests were part of a backlash against the Government's ruling that the price of new cars in Britain must be slashed. </p> <p>He added: 'Britain is still getting more than its fair share of inward investment from around the world compared with the rest of Europe.'</p>"
