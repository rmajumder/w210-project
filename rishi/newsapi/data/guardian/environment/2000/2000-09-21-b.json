  "<p>American regulators seem likely to give the green light to Time Warner's $350bn merger with AOL, brushing aside objections from competitors such as Walt Disney. </p> <p>The news will come as a boost to the two media companies, which are getting a much rougher ride from the European commission. </p> <p>A leaked document from the US federal communications commission, which is scrutinising the deal's competition implications, has revealed a draft recommendation for the tie-up to go ahead. </p> <p>The only condition is that the groups make legally binding their promise to open up their cable television networks to other internet access providers. </p> <p>It is expected that accessing the internet through televisions will become much more common over the next few years. Regulators are keen to ensure that cable television companies do not act as \"gate keepers\", preventing other access providers from reaching customers. </p> <p>Insiders cautioned that the document was merely an \"early snapshot\" of the FCC's view, and more serious sanctions remained possible. </p> <p>An FCC spokeswoman said: \"We are still at the preliminary stages of analysing this merger.\" </p> <p>Walt Disney has been among the opponents of the deal - it is worried that the merged company would have greater power over the distribution of its programming on cable television networks. The deal is the biggest in American corporate history - it will create the world's fourth largest company with 100m subscribers. </p> <p>Time Warner and AOL are now likely to concentrate on putting their case to the European commission - which has indicated that it will block the deal without significant concessions being made. </p> <p>The commission is concerned that the combined company would dominate music publishing - particularly because of its joint venture with EMI. </p> <p>There is also anxiety in Europe about AOL's alliance with the German group Bertelsmann in Europe and Australia. EMI said yesterday that it had offered sufficient concessions to satisfy the commission. It is believed to have agreed to dispose of four publishing catalogues and record labels in France, Denmark, Greece and Spain. </p> <p>An EMI spokesman said the company's pledges addressed concerns \"without materially harming the viability of the deal or removing the commercial rationale\".</p>",
  "<p>Incubators - companies that invest in and provide operational support to early stage internet and technology companies - have been out of favour with investors since the dot.com shake-out in the spring. </p> <p>But Schroder Salomon Smith Barney says there is growing evidence that successful incubators can be expected to give investors the high returns that successful start-ups offer. </p> <p>In Wild Wild West, a glossy, 154-page report published yesterday, SSSB picked out NewMedia Spark, down 2.5p to 64.5p, Brainspark, off 6p at 94.5p, and Inflexion, up 3p to 87.5p, as its favoured plays. </p> <p>In the absence of revenue or meaningful revenue streams, SSSB says, investors should be judging incubators by what it calls \"valuation events\" - external private funding rounds, initial public offerings or trade sales of portfolio companies.</p>",

  "<p>The news that Omnicom and True North have resumed talks over a possible merger will come as a surprise to no-one. When DaimlerChrysler, which spends more than $1bn on advertising through the two companies, said it wanted to cut down to just one major agency it must have seemed the logical thing to do.</p> <p>Whereas once clients sought to prevent their agencies from consolidating, now they seem to be positively encouraging it. DaimlerChrysler has welcomed the move, saying it wants to encourage anything the pitching agencies can do to improve efficiency - ie drive down the cost of running its advertising business.</p> <p>But what is surprising is that the decision to begin talks appears to be a direct consequence of the review. It is a mark of the power wielded by a major global client that agencies will react so quickly and so dramatically. DaimlerChrysler says \"jump\" and the agencies say, \"how high?\".</p> <p>Traditionally, clients have insisted on strict agency demarcations, with their rivals being handled by advertising agencies as far away as possible from their own. This has meant lots of independent agencies handling a diverse range of clients. But the increasingly global nature of business means fewer, bigger clients who want to be able to call on their advertising agency to fulfil pretty much all their marketing needs, anywhere in the world - and that means the ad agencies need to get bigger and more powerful.</p> <p>Procter &amp; Gamble has for a long time had a reputation as the most protective of clients. It is a measure of the power of the world's biggest advertiser that Saatchi &amp; Saatchi was forced to demerge from Cordiant Communications in 1997 because its status as a P&amp;G roster agency meant Bates Worldwide, Cordiant's other agency network, could not pitch for any other household product advertisers.</p> <p>More recently, though, P&amp;G has wielded its authority to persuade agencies to go the other way. Realising that it was no longer served by the leaders of the advertising industry, P&amp;G told its agencies - Leo Burnett, D'Arcy, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi and Grey - that it would welcome any moves to consolidate. It was not long before D'Arcy and Leo Burnett had obliged by linking up with the Japanese agency Dentsu to form Bcom3.</p> <p>Then earlier this year TBWA teamed up with Hakuhodo of Japan to form a joint venture that will serve the two companies' joint Nissan client. And there is still considerable scope for further consolidation. The $64,000 question is, who will be next?</p>",
  "<p>I was having a quiet drink with an old friend the other day when he told me, very proudly, that he had just finished his first novel. This was completely out of character - he had never displayed any interest in writing before - and, with mounting amazement, I asked him what it was about. </p> <p>\"Oh, it was the first Harry Potter book; it really was excellent. I don't know why I haven't tried reading books before,\" he said. </p> <p>After insisting he buy the next round for cracking such an awful Queen Mum gag (weak and terribly old but loved by an insane segment of the population purely because of this), I looked back at the feelings that rushed through my head when I thought he really had completed his first novel. </p> <p>Topping the winner's rostrum was undoubtedly amazement but there, in second and third place looking disappointed as amazement's national anthem played, were envy and depression. Envy because I have never managed to finish a novel and depression because I am worried I never will. This dismal duo could well sound familiar to you; many people dream of writing a novel but few actually finish one, and fewer still get it published, become millionaires and bask forever in the glow of literary appreciation. </p> <p>My biggest problems, the same as many thousands of people, are that I find it hard to get started and am overly critical of the words I do manage to write. In search of a solution to these, I turned to the web. </p> <p>One of the first sites I came across was <a href=\"http://www.inkspot.com\">www.inkspot.com</a>, which describes itself as an \"award-winning resource and community for writers of all ages and levels of experience\". This actually is not too far off; there are plenty of helpful articles on different aspects of writing, a discussion forum and masses of links to other online resources. </p> <p>Reading the articles and joining in the discussions helped me to get a better perspective on my writing. Although I knew in theory that the first draft of a book does not have to be perfect, the truth of it was brought home to me only by chatting to people who had gone through the process. </p> <p>If you are unsure about what you are doing, getting on to the right discussion forum can really help. Inkspot also offers a free bi-weekly email newsletter, called Inklings, which keeps you in touch with new articles and features on the site. </p> <p>I found another discussion forum at <a href=\"http://jp.onelist.com/community/1writers\" target=\"_new\">http://jp.onelist.com/community/1writers</a>. There are a few people there who like to discuss novel writing but there are many more who are just interested in writing bad poetry, so be careful. </p> <p>A much more down to earth and practical site can be found at <a href=\"http://www.manistee.com/~lkraus/workshop/\">www.manistee.com/~lkraus/workshop/</a>. The rather tortuous web address leads to the Internet Writing Workshop, which aspires to create an environment where works in progress can be passed around and critiqued, and to provide a support group where writing can be discussed in depth. </p> <p> Unlike Inkspot, this is a seriously active community. Membership is restricted to people who regularly participate in criticising other members' works, apart from the general discussion group where generic topics such as How can I overcome writer's block? are discussed. </p> <p>I joined the Novels List, which - surprisingly enough - is for the submission and critiques of novel-length fiction. Books are posted to the list in bite-sized chunks, so you can criticise them in manageable parts. </p> <p>The fact that you have to do a certain amount of criticism each month, or face expulsion from the group, means that you really do start to learn from the process. </p> <p>The chance to read and identify parts of other peoples' writing that are poor, indifferent or excellent is incredibly useful when it comes to analysing my own work. I can look at a section and easily see where I've gone wrong because I've seen the same mistake in someone else's prose. </p> <p>Critters is another online critiquing workshop, at <a href=\"http://www.critique.org/users/critters\">www.critique.org/users/critters</a>. Confined to serious science fiction, fantasy and horror writers, it operates a similar system to the Internet Writing Workshop. It boasts more than a thousand members, each providing a critique per week. If you have finished a novel, there is a special section for getting the entire thing criticised quickly, rather than piece by piece. </p> <p>Stepping back into the literary mainstream for a moment, <a href=\"http://www.purefiction.co.uk\">www.purefiction.co.uk</a> is the only British site that is really worth visiting. Soon to be relaunched, the old site nonetheless has plenty of articles on the business of novel writing, from plotting a thriller to choosing a central character and jump-starting your creativity. This is all useful but the danger of reading about writing a novel, rather than actually writing it, is omnipresent. </p> <p>The most valuable sites are those that link you to other writers, so you can share ideas and criticisms. For me, this has meant increased determination and self-confidence. I am still nowhere near the end of my book, but my writing output has increased and I no longer fiddle with every word as I go along. </p> <p>Expect to be buying my quirky, modern British novel, Dog On Roof, from your local bookshop in spring 2002.</p>",

  "After 28 Greenpeace activists, including former Labour minister Lord Melchett, were cleared over the destruction of a field of genetically modified maize, environmental groups says that government plans to increase GM trials are doomed. Wendy Gracefield explains the issues. <p><b>What were the protesters in court for?</b><br> Lord Melchett is a former Labour minister, working farmer and head of Greenpeace UK. On 26 July last year, he and 27 others made a dawn raid on a six-acre GM maize crop being grown by three brothers for seed company Agrevo. They broke into remote Walnut Tree farm, near Lyng, Norfolk, shredded the crops with a lorry and cutting machine and started bagging them up. The volunteers, who were all wearing white decontamination suits, were quickly stopped by the vigilant farmers, who fought back by using their tractors as battering rams.</p> <p><b>So why did Greenpeace object to the GM maize?</b><br> Greenpeace says genetically modified food destroys the environment and is bad for human health. In fact, the group argued that they had a legal excuse to uproot the crops because leaving them to flower and pollinate would have led to a greater crime - the contamination of other crops in the vicinity. Similar widespread objections means supermarkets are stepping up the sale of organic food. Protesters object to crop trials that could possibly spread genetically modified species to other crops that are currently GM free.</p> <p><b>What is GM food anyway?</b><br> Farmers and growers have always used traditional methods of cross breeding to make their tomatoes sweeter, their trees sturdier and their plants hardier. In the past, genes were transferred between the same species, but new technology means they can be transferred within different species. In Britain, the Department of the Environment has agreed to 73 sites for GM trials this year. They include 12 spring-sown oilseed rape crops, 12 forage maize crops and 24 beet crops. Twenty-five sites are being planted with GM autumn-sown oilseed rape. Environmentalists worry that this will disturb the natural balance and have, as yet, unknown health consequences.</p> <p><b>Why bother growing it then?</b><br> Scientists argue that genetically modified crops could be the key to richer wildlife and efficient food production. GM foods can be made to be very hardy, resistant to common diseases and faster growing. Sir John Beringer, the dean at Bristol University recently told a London science conference that.the presence of more songbirds on British farms would depend on encouraging the survival of more weeds and insects. Genetically modifying crops would help to do this.</p> <p><b>Any other advantages?</b><br> Fruit and vegetables can be modified to improve our health. Scientists are now in the process of altering apples and strawberries into antibacterial treatments that would protect against tooth decay. An apple a day really might keep the dentist away. Tomatoes and bananas are also being tipped as a worldwide vaccine for hepatitis B. Scientists say that, if they are genetically altered to contain the vaccine, it would save millions of lives as hepatitis B is the precursor of liver cancer, the single biggest cause of cancer deaths.</p> <p><b>What will happen to British grown GM crops now?</b><br> It is hard to tell what effect the court case will have on future GM development, but it is unlikely to stop it altogether. The Department of Environment has vowed to continue with its trials. It says that, if it were to stop the strictly controlled research, there would be widespread GM crop planting but there would be no scientific feedback. Meanwhile, Friends of the Earth claims the protesters' victory means other groups are legally able to destroy GM crops that are about to go to pollen. Lord Melchett warned that Greenpeace might take similar action in future. He said: \"We don't have immediate plans, but, if the government don't do anything and the chemical companies don't stop planting these crops, we can't rule anything out.\"</p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/gmdebate/\">Special report: GM food</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Greenpeace</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.greendirect.co.uk/gmo.htm\" target=\"_new\">Grassroots magazine</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.nuffieldfoundation.org/bioethics/publication/modifiedcrops/rep0008132.html\" target=\"_new\">Nuffield Council on Bioethics</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.foe.org/\" target=\"_new\">Friends of the Earth</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.detr.gov.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Department of the Environment</a></p>",

  "<p>Not content to rest on its laurels while it awaits EU regulatory approval on its \u00a314bn merger with Time Warner, EMI has revealed details of a wide-ranging partnership with Europe's largest free music download website Peoplesound.com - the first deal of its kind in Europe.</p> <p>The three-year exclusive tie-up means that Peoplesound.com can tap into EMI's global administration for its own artists or pass the artist on to EMI to sign while sharing joint ownership of that artist. While the deal is a non-cash deal, details of how royalties will be split between the two companies are not available.</p> <p>Peoplesound.com has developed a database-driven tool to recognise which artists are the most popular on its site, helping it to decide which artists to sign up for its own online music publishing division. </p> <p>\"Publishers are moving more and more into new media but they have to make sure they build businesses that are attractive to both consumers and artists,\" said Ernesto Schmitt, president of Peoplesound.com, adding that Farmclub.com (Universal Music's attempt to do online music publishing) wasn't working for precisely these reasons. He added that it was very significant that a major label was partnering with an MP3 website, effectively recognising that MP3 will play a big part in the future of the music industry.</p> <p>Commenting on the partnership, Helen Snell, analyst at ABN Amro, said: \"It sounds like a very sensible deal from EMI's point of view - there's nothing to be lost as it's merely tapping into a new A&amp;R source and it saves on EMI's legwork. The benefit will be that EMI gets to test something in the marketplace before having to sign up the artists.\"</p>",
  "Everybody knows that the taxes on petrol and diesel are lower in Europe than in Britain, yet the fuel price protests are not confined to Britain. Truckers and farmers all over Europe are protesting. This confirms that the recent cost increases in Britain owe more to the rise in prices charged by the oil companies than to anything that the British government has done. It also demonstrates that whatever happens to fuel duties, we need to address the fundamental problems of unjustified fluctuations in world oil prices. <p>In 1990 in the run-up to the Gulf war, the oil companies pushed up the price of petrol and claimed it was because of inexorable market forces which had forced up the worldwide price of crude oil. As shadow energy secretary, I set up Labour's petrol price monitoring unit. This exposed the truth, eventually accepted by nearly every commentator not in the pocket of the oil industry, that the increases owed little to a shortage of oil and a great deal to profiteering by the oil companies. </p> <p>They are at it again. The impression the oil industry has created is that there is a shortage of oil which has increased the world price and that the companies are innocent victims of market forces. Oh yeah! </p> <p>Let's look at the facts. Figures from the International Energy Agency show that the world production of crude oil in August this year was higher than in 1998. Yet in 1998 the average crude oil price was just $12.52 per barrel compared with $34 per barrel today. Over and above the August production figures, output is expected to rise by 1.7m barrels per day or 2.2% of total world production. Some 0.8m of these extra barrels have been promised by OPEC and a further 0.94m extra barrels are expected from non-OPEC countries. So production shortages, or fear of production shortages, can't be the explanation. The companies also claim that oil stocks are low. They don't mention that the stocks that are low are mainly their stocks and that it was they who decided to stock less. </p> <p>The oil companies also claim that oil consumption has risen as a result of economic expansion. Surely an effective global oil system should be able to respond without needing huge price increases. </p> <p>No one can safely say whether there is an oil shortage because although production figures are available worldwide, storage and consumption figures are not. So the world is laid open to the effects of rumours and propaganda from speculators who usually lay the blame for price increases on OPEC. This badly managed cartel must take some of the blame - but only some. </p> <p>Most people have the impression that the world depends overwhelmingly on OPEC for its oil supplies. Not so. Only 40% of the world's oil supplies come from OPEC countries. They make up only four of the top 10 producers. Saudi Arabia leads with 8.2m barrels a day, but is closely followed by the US on 8.1m and Russia on 6.5m. Combined Norwegian and UK production from the North Sea totalled 6.3m barrels a day in the first quarter of this year, although it had fallen to 5.7m by August. </p> <p>The North Sea also illustrates that the cost of producing oil hasn't risen much since 1998, yet the oil companies are getting nearly three times as much money for every barrel they produce there. And that is broadly true the world over - it is the price of crude that has risen, not the cost of producing it. </p> <p>So who is getting the extra money? The answer is the oil companies. They produce the oil. They transport it. They store it (or don't store it). They refine it. They retail it. Above all, they buy and sell it. Oil trading is done by oil companies and speculators. No Martians are involved. The price of oil and oil products is what the oil companies pay and get paid. That is why they run up such huge extra profits during periods when oil prices are high. This is harming the rest of us because it means that the oil sector is taking a much bigger share from the world's economy. </p> <p>The impact of this on Britain and Europe is there for all to see, but it pales into insignificance compared with its impact on Africa. Nigeria and Libya may benefit, but to meet the higher oil prices the rest of the African countries face ruinous calls on funds they don't possess. They cannot do without oil. They need more oil to expand and prosper. Yet they simply can't afford it. Countries which were looking forward to better times, with debt written off and increased production and exports, now face being crushed by a mountain of new debt just to pay today's higher fuel bills. </p> <p>Under the present system, consumer countries, both rich and poor, are suffering. Many producer countries, including some members of OPEC, suffer from the economic, fiscal and social uncertainties caused by wild fluctuations in oil prices. The only constant beneficiaries of the present system are the oil companies. </p> <p>Clearly, the present global market in oil isn't working. It is doing the world more harm than good. Almost everyone would benefit from more stability. So I hope that when the G7 meet this weekend, they won't just pressurise OPEC to increase production. What they need to do is to work with oil producers and consumers around the world to develop a structure which provides more stability in the production, transport, storage, refining and distribution of oil and oil products. </p> <p>The present system is unsustainable and needs to be changed. A worldwide, transparent and accountable system should take its place. It would not be perfect, but it would be better than what we have got. It might even be so successful that oil companies in the UK would do everything necessary to keep the forecourts properly supplied. That'll be the day. </p> <p> Frank Dobson MP was shadow energy secretary 1989-92 </p> <p>comment@theguardian.com</p>",
  "<p>Anti-globalisation activists and international bankers are bracing themselves for a week of street action and possible confrontation planned to coincide with the annual meeting of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund in Prague. </p> <p>Hundreds of protesters have already gathered in the Czech capital and tens of thousands are expected to arrive within the next few days in the run up to the opening day of the summit on Tuesday. </p> <p>Yesterday they outlined their protest schedule, which peaks with plans to blockade the meeting place of the world bankers and financiers, in an effort to persuade leaders to \"dismantle\" the two institutions. </p> <p>\"We will surround the conference centre until we've made our point clear, and until they decide for themselves on abolishing both institutions,\" said Alice Dvorska of Inpeg, the Initiative against economic globalisation, an umbrella group uniting most of the protesters. </p> <p>The summit is the first of its kind to be held in a former Soviet bloc country. A counter summit, S26, on Tuesday will be accompanied by protest action in more than 40 other countries. Organisers stressed that S26 would be non-violent and would start in the morning with a \"rally for global justice\", with thousands of protesters expected to gather in Prague's Namesti Miru (Peace Square). They would then begin a \"unity march\" towards the conference centre in the south of the city, despite being refused a legal permit by city hall officials who cited \"traffic complications\". </p> <p>Police spokeswoman Iva Knolova said: \"Thanks to the security measures we have taken, the opponents will not manage to carry out the planned blockade, and we will increase even further the number of guards around the congress centre and monitor the situation closely.\" </p> <p>Authorities expressed fears that Prague would become a stage for violence, announcing a ban on demonstrations in some city districts, and in many cases refusing to grant legal permits for specific rallies and marches. </p> <p><strong> Festive mood</strong><br> </p> <p> But Ms Dvorska said: \"We hope to create an atmosphere that is festive and celebratory, but that also demonstrates our outrage at the unjust, misguided policies that the IMF and World Bank force upon the world.\" </p> <p>In the north-east of Prague finishing touches were being put to a huge tent-city at the giant Strahov stadium. It will open today and has room to house 15,000 protesters at a cost of \u00a326 per person for the duration of the conference. </p> <p>Protesters said they had sent an open letter to the Czech President, Vaclav Havel, asking the former dissident to defend their right to protest. \"In November 1989 we won some fundamental democratic rights, including the right to free assembly and free expression of political opinions,\" the letter read. \"We demand that our fundamental civil rights and freedoms are respected.\" </p> <p>Visitors arriving in the Czech Republic yesterday were reporting long delays at the borders amid stringent police checks. </p> <p>Police said they had turned back 600 people on the border with Germany. \"Half of them weren't allowed in because their cars were deemed to be in too bad a condition, and most of the others were carrying dangerous objects or didn't have valid documents,\" said west Bohemia police spokeswoman Milada Sucha. </p> <p>Chelsea Mozen of Inpeg said they were lobbying for three Dutch cooks who had been turned back: \"We find it hard to believe how organic vegetarian cooks could be a threat to national security.\"</p>",
  "<p>Greenpeace's executive director and 27 other environmental activists were yesterday cleared of causing criminal damage to a field of genetically modified maize, in a verdict with profound implications for the future of GM crop trials and direct action. </p> <p>Lord Melchett and his fellow protesters, 13 of whom also work for Greenpeace, were acquitted at a retrial at Norwich crown court after claiming they had lawful excuse to attack the crop at a farm in Lyng, Norfolk, in July 1999. </p> <p>The not guilty verdicts were greeted with cries of delight and tears from some of the defendants and applause from the gallery. Outside some defendants were congratulated by jury members. </p> <p>At the original trial in April the 28 were cleared of theft, but the jury was unable to reach a verdict on criminal damage charges after seven and a half hours. </p> <p>The defendants, who include a Baptist minister, a beautician and the caretaker from Greenpeace's London office, were awarded costs for both trials. The total cost to the crown prosecution service was estimated at \u00a3250,000. </p> <p>Speaking outside the court, Lord Melchett said the verdict sent a clear message to the government. \"The time has come for Mr Blair and the chemical companies to stop growing GM crops. </p> <p>\"We have known for a long time that people don't want to eat GM food; supermarkets won't sell GM food and now the time has come for people to stop planting GM food.\" </p> <p>He said the verdict did not give a green light to other protesters to destroy crops, but refused to rule out similar action by Greenpeace in the future. </p> <p>\"The next step is for the government to take action. We don't have immediate plans, but if the government don't do anything and the chemical companies don't stop planting these crops, we won't rule anything out.\" </p> <p>A spokesman for the Department of the Environment said the crop trials would continue. \"If we halted our strictly controlled research then there would be widespread GM crop planting without us getting the evidence we need,\" he said. \"Our top priority is to protect the environment and human health.\" </p> <p>Seventy three sites were chosen for crop trials this year and already 12 spring-sown oilseed rape crops, 12 forage maize crops and 24 beet crops have been harvested. Twenty five sites are being planted with GM autumn-sown oilseed rape. </p> <p>Under EU law the government has no plans to ban GM crop planting, but the biochemical companies have agreed to take part in a four-year trial programme, now in its second year. </p> <p>William Brigham, the farmer on whose land the GM maize was grown, said the verdict gave \"the green light to trespass and the green light to vandalism\". </p> <p>\"This attack was a frightening experience for myself and my family,\" he said. \"Greenpeace is a massive environmental pressure group and we are a small family farm. They used bully boy tactics to get their point across and today the bully has won.\" </p> <p>Scimac, the industry body which represents Aventis, the biotech company which developed the GM maize on Mr Brigham's farm, also condemned the verdict. </p> <p>\"This raises concerns that go much deeper than the safety of GM crops,\" its chairman, Roger Turner, said. \"It raises fundamental questions about the ability of our legal system to cope with the gradual erosion of respect for public rights and authority. </p> <p>\"We are disappointed that an extreme minority do not have enough confidence in the strength of their argument to let science decide.\" </p> <p>Mike Schwarz, a partner at Bindman and Partners, the solicitors who acted for Greenpeace, said the verdict was a vindication of the jury system. \"Juries understand reasonable citizens' actions. But to get to juries you have to get past police forces keen to clamp down on protesters and a CPS which wants to keep these cases in magistrates courts and away from juries.\" </p> <p>The verdict provoked anger from the National Farmers' Union, which described it as \"perverse\" and as declaring \"open season\" on farmland. </p> <p>The NFU's president, Ben Gill, said he would be writing to the home secretary, Jack Straw, ahead of a planned meeting to discuss the issues raised by the case. </p> <p>\"We find it extraordinary that even with such clear evidence a not-guilty verdict was reached,\" he said. \"This gives the green light to wanton vandalism and trespass.\" </p> <p>Peter Tidey, chief crown prosecutor for Norfolk, defended the decision to bring a retrial. \"Criminal damage is a serious offence and allegations that an offence was premeditated and carried out by a group of people are taken into consideration when deciding whether to proceed,\" he said. </p> <p>The attack on Mr Brigham's crop took place at dawn on the July 26 last year when the 28 protesters, 19 men and nine women aged between 22 and 52, converged on his farm. </p> <p>Dressed in white overalls with the Greenpeace logo on the back and accompanied by four journalists including a video cameraman, the group set about removing the entire six and a half acre crop. </p> <p>They had brought with them a tractor with a cutting device and a tipper truck. \"I was there with the intention of removing the entire crop, of bagging it and returning it to its owners, AgrEvo Ltd [now Aventis] in King's Lynn,\" Lord Melchett told the court. </p> <p>The aim of removing the entire crop was crucial to the defence case. The protesters argued that they had lawful excuse under the Criminal Damage Act 1971 to uproot the crop, as leaving it to flower and pollinate would have led to a greater crime - the contamination of other crops in the vicinity. \"We are delighted the jury agreed with us,\" Lord Melchett said. </p> <p>Greenpeace targeted the maize on Mr Brigham's land after he gave an interview to the Eastern Daily Press in which he said he would be growing the crop under contract for AgrEvo. </p> <p>The publicity prompted villagers in Lyng to hold a public meeting to discuss the crop trial. Mr Brigham was invited but, on the advice of AgrEvo, did not attend. </p> <p>Following the meeting, Lord Melchett wrote to him urging him to discontinue the trial. Shortly afterwards the farmer gave an interview to Farmers Weekly in which he indicated that the maize was due to flower within a week. This prompted Greenpeace to carry out its action. </p> <p>\"That crop, when it flowered, would release GM material widely,\" Lord Melchett said. It posed \"the most serious environmental threat... it's alive, so it can't be cleared up like chemical pollution, or even nuclear waste.\"</p>",
  "<p>The chancellor, Gordon Brown, launched a robust defence of the embattled International Monetary Fund and World Bank yesterday. </p> <p>The two organisations are under fire from anti-globalisation protesters who blame them for widening the gap between rich and poor, and from rightwingers in the US Congress who reject their roles in managing world markets. </p> <p>Mr Brown, speaking ahead of the IMF/World Bank annual meeting in Prague this weekend, said both institutions played a vital role in preventing instability in the world economy, but more must be done to ensure that globalisation worked for the poor as well. </p> <p>\"The message from Prague for us all - governments, institutions, demonstrators - must be that in the new world of open capital markets, the proper course is not to retreat from global cooperation or globalisation,\" Mr Brown said. </p> <p>\"The way forward is to enhance international economic cooperation. So we reject those that argue we should turn our back on globalisation, in effect a return to the protectionism of the 1930s.\" </p> <p>Mr Brown's speech to a meeting of Commonwealth finance ministers in Malta came after the new managing director of the IMF, Horst K\u00f6hler, pledged that his organisation would listen to its critics. \"This Prague meeting, hopefully, is a major milestone in this dialogue and open discussion on the future role of the fund,\" he said. </p> <p>The IMF is under attack from aid agencies and development lobbyists as well as the protesters camped on the other side of the river from the meetings. It is accused of dragging its feet on debt relief, imposing harsh economic remedies on developing countries, and ignoring the widening disparities between rich and poor. </p> <p>Mr K\u00f6hler acknowledged yesterday that large parts of the world had not shared in the prosperity brought about by closer global economic integration. \"The huge income inequalities in the world, are in my view, a major problem for a good future in this millennium,\" he said, but stressed that the IMF still believed in its traditional remedies of strong non-inflationary growth, open markets and privatising inefficient state enterprises. </p> <p>Debt relief was an important first step to tackling poverty, but \"it is no quick fix to solve this issue\", Mr K\u00f6hler said.</p>",
  "<p>The conciliatory tone of the new chief of the International Monetary Fund yesterdayy as he welcomed delegates to IMF and World Bank meetings in Prague fell on deaf ears as protesters gathered to demonstrate against globalisation. </p> <p>Some 18,000 bankers, finance ministers and government officials will be struggling through barricades to try to debate reform of the financial system, the ailing euro, the need for more international trade liberalisation, and ways of speeding up debt relief to the poorest countries. </p> <p>But they will be matched by around 20,000 protesters for whom the annual meeting of the IMF and its sister organisation, the World Bank, symbolises everything that is wrong with globalisation - its domination by the rich and powerful, its lack of concern for the poor, and its disregard for the environmental consequences of unfettered growth. </p> <p>Horst K\u00f6hler, the new managing director of the fund, is presenting himself as its new caring face, concerned about globalisation's downsides as well as its opportunities. Yesterday he described the organisation as an \"open institution\" which learns from \"experience and dialogue\". </p> <p>But Ann Pettifor, the director of Jubilee 2000, the coalition campaigning for cancellation of unpayable third world debts, describes the fund and the bank as the last great communist banks, unaccountable either to the markets or to western taxpayers who ultimately foot the bill for their lending. </p> <p>The group of seven industrialised countries, which controls nearly half the votes on the IMF's board, is able to direct the destinies of the poor countries who are the fund's main clients but control less than 2% of votes. </p> <p>As far as the fund is concerned, the world economy has come through the financial crises of 1997 and 1998 and is now in good shape. All that is needed for the rosy scenario to continue is for a little less growth in the US and a little more in Japan and Europe to take up the slack. While accepting that some mistakes were made during the crises, it broadly believes that globalisation - the greater integration of the world economy by breaking down barriers to trade and movements of capital - is a force for good. </p> <p>For the protesters, by contrast, the problems in Indonesia and Russia were symptomatic of a financial system that is inherently unstable, just as the moves to open up trade shows the indifference of big business to the environment, and the sluggish pace of debt relief illustrates a lack of concern for the poor. </p> <p>Chastened by the chaotic scenes in Seattle last December, when talks aimed at launching new trade negotiations collapsed amid violent scenes on the streets, the fund and the World Bank are trying to show that they are listening to protesters. Last week the bank released its world development report, which stressed that growth had to be accompanied by policies to remove inequality, tackle corruption and promote democracy. </p> <p>Jessica Woodroffe, head of campaigns at the World Development Movement (WDM), said that while the fund's new head might be talking a different language, on the ground it was business as usual. </p> <p>The fund is accused by the WDM and other non governmental organisations of giving poor countries hundreds of hurdles to jump before they can have their debts written off by western creditors. They include unpopular budget tightening measures and complex privatisations. </p> <p>\"Holding up debt relief because a country has not privatised its cotton or copper industry is absurd,\" said Ms Woodroffe. \"It is nothing to do with ensuring debt relief is spent on poverty reduction but everything to with the IMF forcing countries to fit its Jurassic economic models.\" </p> <p>Western politicians have been caught unawares by the way in which the protesters have used new technologies - particularly the internet and the mobile phone - to organise themselves. </p> <p>But unlike the fuel tax protesters who brought Britain to a halt last week, the ragtag army flooding into Prague lacks a defined programme. The bank and the fund hope that, in the absence of positive ideas that engage with the broad mass of voters, the demonstrations will eventually peter out. </p> <p>Clare Short, the international development secretary, says that the destruction of the fund, the bank and the World Trade Organisation would not help the poor, but simply leave them at the mercy of truly unregulated capitalism. Progressives, she believes, should instead try to reform the institutions. </p> <p>But so far, Ms Short's arguments have made little headway. The success of the protesters in shutting down Seattle has meant that every subsequent international meeting has seen a standoff between demonstrators and the police. Prague offers the first real opportunity for anti-globalisation groups in Europe to protest and they intend to make the most of it. </p> <p>\"We want to make the financiers' lives as difficult as possible in Prague and disrupt their meeting,\" said Viktor Piorecky, a spokesman for Inpeg, an umbrella group organising many of the 200 planned demonstrations and gatherings. </p> <p>\"We don't consider the IMF and World Bank to be legitimate institutions and they don't have the right to have meetings somewhere and decide about other people's lives,\" he added. </p> <p>Amid concern that violence will erupt, schools in Prague will close and businesses will shut for the duration of the meetings. Even Prague's taxi drivers, normally eager to take advantage of outsiders, have decided to take a holiday. </p> <p>For the Czech authorities, hosting the fund and bank meetings has turned into something of a nightmare. The gathering of the great and good of international finance was supposed to showcase the country, the first former communist regime to host the event, and to reveal how far it had come in the decade since the fall of the Berlin wall. </p> <p>\"The government will certainly respect the right of demonstrators to express their views about these organisations, but it will not respect any right to violent protest actions,\" the prime minister, Milos Zeman, said last week. </p> <p>But now there are fears that the face presented to the world will be of the old Czechoslovakia, with police crush ing protests as they did in 1968, rather than of the new Czech Republic, plugged into the market-driven global economy.</p>",
  "A few months ago I used this column to argue that the World Bank was destroying health and education in the developing world. <p>In Zambia, for example, the conditions the bank had attached to its loans - cuts in state spending and the privatisation of services - had contributed to a 25% increase in infant mortality since 1980 and, as parents now have to pay to have their children educated, a disastrous decline in school enrolment. </p> <p>The bank, oddly enough, didn't seem to be too happy about my analysis. \"It is simply false,\" Mats Karlsson, one of its vice-presidents wrote, \"to claim that the World Bank is further impoverishing people.\" It was, he insisted, lending developing countries more money for health, education and poverty reduction than ever before. </p> <p>This is perfectly true. This year, for example, the World Bank will be handing out some $1.9bn for schools in poor countries. It will also be destroying schooling worth many times this amount by continuing to insist that countries put debt repayments ahead of public spending. It has yet to explain why on earth it is making dollar loans for schools in the first place, when nearly all their costs are incurred in local currencies. Only if local provision is to be replaced by foreign contractors, or if children are to be given computers before they are taught to read or write, does lending hard currency for basic education make sense. First they break your legs, then, by way of compensation, they offer you a pedicure. </p> <p>At their grand summit in Prague at the end of this week, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund will insist, as the IMF's former managing director has claimed, that they are now \"the best friends of the poor\". The bad old days of \"structural adjustment\" -forcing all the countries they deal with to accept precisely the same neoliberal prescriptions - are over. Instead of being obliged to accept policies imposed by the first world, debtor nations will now be allowed to devise their own \"poverty-reduction strategies\". </p> <p> This sounds fine, until you discover that, as the World Development Movement has documented, the recipient countries can request whatever they want as long as it's neoliberalism. As one senior bank official pointed out, the new scheme is a \"compulsory programme, so that those with the money can tell those without the money what they need in order to get the money\". </p> <p>To me, the abiding mystery surrounding the World Bank and the IMF is why anyone still believes that they are capable of reform. The New Economics Foundation concludes its devastating critique of the two bodies by suggesting only that they should \"undergo democratic overhauls\". Even the Guardian's usually far-sighted economics editor, Larry Elliott, has argued that those who believe the World Bank and IMF are inherently corrupt \"are not only wrong, but are giving succour to extremists on the right who oppose all but minimalist government and despise internationalism\". There is, most commentators agree, no alternative to the existing global financial system. </p> <p>This is not a consensus that John Maynard Keynes would have joined. In 1944, he warned that a financial system which imposed penalties and strictures on debtor nations but not creditor nations would ensure that the rich became richer and the poor became poorer. He proposed a global financial institution which would charge interest on both debt and credit. Creditor nations would thus be encouraged to spend their surpluses in debtor nations, automatically correcting imbalances in trade. </p> <p>The US proposed an alternative system. Help for debtor nations would be confined to a fund and a bank which lent them money when they got into trouble. These would both be based in Washington and effectively controlled by the creditors. As Keynes foresaw, the US proposal would ensure both that debtor nations fell further into debt and that creditors - the US in particular - could exercise ever-greater economic and political power over them. But the US told Britain that if we didn't accept its proposal, we wouldn't get our war loan. </p> <p>The World Bank and the IMF, in other words, were conceived as the policemen for a coercive and grossly unbalanced world order. The idea that they could deliver anything but disaster for the world's poor is laughable. If, as they will claim in Prague, they want to help build a fairer world, then they must start by closing themselves down. </p> <p>\u0095 George Monbiot's new book, Captive State: the Corporate Takeover of Britain, is published today by Macmillan </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:g.monbiot@zetnet.co.uk\">g.monbiot@zetnet.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>A mythical landscape of snow- covered fantasy, Lapland is inhabited by Santa Claus and his team of industrious elves creating colourful gadgets for the world's children. Finland, the country on whose peninsula the real Lapland perches is actually inhabited by Nokia and a constellation of inventive, mobile technology companies developing the next generation of colourful gadgets for the world's grown-ups. </p> <p>In less than ten years Finland has moved at a meteoric pace from a country dependent on the export of paper and pulp for the majority of its GDP to one which is leading the world in cutting edge mobile internet and phone technologies. </p> <p>It is more than a little ironic that such an economy should spawn the very technology tipped to eliminate dependence on and demand for paper. Stranger still is that - just as the mobile internet is on the verge of changing how we do business for ever - the paper industry in Finland is running at optimum. </p> <p>In a staggeringly short period of time, Helsinki has emerged as the centre of the next big technological revolution. We may not be writing the epitaph for paper just yet, but the script for the true impact of mobile communications is being written before our eyes. </p> <p>Sixty-five per cent of Finland's population owns a mobile phone - the largest penetration in the world. It also has the cheapest rates for telephone calls in Europe. </p> <p> For the Finns, internet banking is taken for granted, text messaging is a national pastime and acting as the world's mobile technology laboratory is as natural as snow in winter. </p> <p>Multinationals, like IBM, are rushing to invest in Finnish start-ups. In just two years the country has gone from having a handful of venture capitalist firms specialising mainly in engineering to attracting hordes of hi-tech investors eager to back the next big thing. </p> <p>Mika Nieminen, founder and chief executive of m-commerce software developer More Magic, estimates that the amount of venture capital chasing a home in m-commerce is around $3bn. </p> <p>More Magic predicts that transactions made through mobile handsets could be worth upwards of $50bn by 2004. </p> <p>Even Sonera, the long established Finnish national telephone company, is diversifying into the mobile internet portal market and is aiming to be a global player thanks to m-commerce. They put the mobile boom down to \"A telecom friendly government\". </p> <p><strong> Wireless community</strong><br> </p> <p> A receptive business and legal climate, and a small but technophile population, makes Finland the ideal market to develop and pilot new and experimental technologies. In Arbianranta, a quiet stretch of industrial park in a corner of Helsinki, something remarkable is taking \"shape in the form of the \"virtual village\". </p> <p>The theory goes that in the virtual village wireless and broadband technology will allow you to turn your home appliances on before you get home. If you want to pick up some shopping on the way there you can check the inventory of the local shop to see if it has what you want, order it and pay for it before you get there. If you need a taxi don't bother telling it where to pick you up. Your sim card in your mobile phone is connected to the village network and a digital map will tell the taxi firm your exact location. </p> <p>In practice all this happens in the virtual village. The brainchild of Digia, a Helsinki-based wireless software developer, the village sprang into life after a $1bn investment from Helsinki city council and blue chip partners including, IBM, Nokia, Symbian and Sonera. Within five years, say the Finns, the village will be the world's first truly wireless community. </p> <p><strong> Old models redundant</strong><br> </p> <p> When fully operational it will be the test centre for cutting-edge experimental mobile technologies. More than this, however, it will act as a laboratory for testing new business models to accompany the technology. Founder and chairman of Digia, Pekka Sinonen says: \"The village will help identify business models from the processes in everyday life.Behaviour will drive technology. Not the other way round.\" </p> <p>Mr Sinonen claims the old model of inventing the technology and then trying to find a suitable business or commercial application for it will be redundant. The village, he says will produce an organic method for developing less risky business models and strategies. It is all made possible by smart phones, the next generation mobile phones equipped with a Psion-designed operating system.The smart phone is your PC, palm pilot, phone and personal organiser rolled into one. It will be faster, more versatile and user-friendly than any previous technology. It will be the physical embodiment of technological convergence. </p> <p>It is this new age of mobile technology which will make money for global brands like Nokia in the future. But it will also facilitate the growth of m-commerce for new and old business alike.</p>",
  "<p>With the bid for <strong> Thames Water</strong> out in the open, market professionals yesterday were trying to track down the next takeover target. </p> <p>Various stories were doing the rounds, some of which dealers had heard many times before. But on a day when the FTSE 100 was falling to a 12-week closing low the tales provided an interesting diversion. </p> <p> <strong> Royal &amp; Sun Alliance</strong> was once again said to be on full bid alert after heavyish buying of the stock (almost 8m changed hands) reignited talk that a European insurer is poised to make an offer. The usual suspects, such as France's Axa and Germany's Allianz were being touted. However, the stock closed down 4.5p at 460.5p, indicating that most traders were not taking it too seriously. </p> <p>Meanwhile, there was chatter of an approach for perennial takeover favourite <strong> Hewden-Stuart </strong>, up 0.5p at 69.5p, and, more interestingly, a tale concerning <strong> DFS Furniture</strong>. </p> <p>Shares in the furniture retailer and manufacturer rose sharply, touching 330p before coming back to 16.5p better, a 5.35% rise, at 325p. While there was speculation of a takeover approach, most punters were looking at the company's fundamentals. </p> <p>DFS publishes its full year figures on October 12 and by all accounts trading has been very strong. In fact, profits for the year to July 31 are likely to be the highest in the group's 32-year history. If this is the case, the gossips argue, then DFS can reasonably be expected to pay another special dividend. Last October, they point out, DFS surprised the City with a \u00a310m special dividend and, with a healthy cash position, they claim a repeat performance is on the way. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the wider market suffered a nasty sell-off over concerns about the state of corporate earnings and the inflationary effects of the high oil price. Weak from the outset, the benchmark FTSE 100 index ended down 123.6 points at 6,279.9, with most of the damage coming in the last hour as dealers offloaded stock in response to a downward lurch in the futures market. </p> <p>Telecom and oil stocks led the market lower. News of profit-warning from US group Sprint and, closer to home, a large placing of stock sent telecom shares reeling. Market heavyweight <strong> Vodafone</strong> eased 15.75p to 247p, while <strong> British Telecom</strong> slipped 19p to 791p and <strong> Marconi </strong> shed 60p to 985p. </p> <p>However, <strong> Energis</strong>, down 67p, or 11.32%, to 525p, was the worst performer of the lot after announcing a placing of 77.7m shares to raise \u00a3400m. The placing conducted by Cazenove and Dresdner Kleinwort Benson was said to have been oversubscribed. </p> <p>Mining stocks were also out of favour as investors steered clear of cyclical stocks on concerns the oil price will hinder global economic growth. <strong> Billiton</strong> fell 17.5p to 246.5p and <strong> Rio Tinto</strong> surrendered 70p to \u00a310.60p as HSBC Securities lowered its rating to \"hold\" from \"add\". </p> <p>But a handful of tech stocks managed to hold their own on the back of Nasdaq's strong showing on Tuesday.<strong> CMG</strong> rose 98p to \u00a313.28p, <strong> Misys</strong> added 20p to 650p and <strong> Baltimore</strong> advanced 12p to 700p. </p> <p>Spirits firm <strong> Diageo</strong> gained 8.5p to 585.5p as a three week tour of major institutional investors got into full swing. </p> <p>In the mid-cap world water stocks sparkled after Thames Water, up 238p to \u00a311.53p, confirmed takeover discussions. <strong> Kelda Group</strong> put on 21.5p to 371.5p, <strong> Anglian Water</strong> advanced 32p to 560p and <strong> Pennon</strong> rose 30.5p to 630p. </p> <p>But chemicals company <strong> British Vita</strong> fell 20p to 175.5p after a profit warning from its US associate Spartech. Meanwhile, steel group <strong> Corus</strong>, off 5p to 51.5p, was marked down again following a profit warning from French rival Usinor and talk that Schroder Salomon Smith Barney had placed 38m shares at 54p. </p> <p><strong> GEI International</strong>, a tiny machinery and packaging group, plunged 3.75p to 2.75p on news that it is to cancel its listing.</p>",
  "<p>Diet in the first days of pregnancy could determine a baby's health in later life according to research at the University of Southampton. </p> <p>Embryos are \"programmed\" by their environment. A malnourished mother means a slower development for the embryo, ending in a lower weight at birth. And low birth weight has been linked with diabetes, high blood pressure, a greater risk of stroke and other disadvantages. </p> <p>But Tom Fleming and colleagues at Southampton think that this programming could begin even before the embryo implants in the womb, in the first few days after conception. </p> <p>Today's New Scientist reports that after female rats mated they were fed a low protein diet for the next four and a half days, the timespan between fertilisation and implantation. Thereafter, the rats ate normally. </p> <p>Female baby rats born to these mothers were small, but only at birth. They then grew with unusual speed before settling down to a normal growth rate. Males were born normal-sized, but grew abnormally: they also developed high blood pressure, shrunken livers and enlarged kidneys. </p> <p>The researchers also took early embryos from the underfed mother rats and counted the cells: they had fewer cells because there had been fewer cell divisions, as if the process of growth had been slowed down. </p> <p>The relationship between diet and fertility and development of a baby is puzzling. Scientists have tried half-starving rats, feeding them sufficient protein but severely restricting their calorie intake, and found that this seemed to extend lifespan but lower fertility. Researchers have observed that under-nourished human mothers are likely to have children with low birthweight and a tendency to obesity and diabetes later in life, as food supply improves. </p> <p>But mothers also have their own way of protecting their unborn infants: one explanation for morning sickness is that it developed to protect embryos from food-borne illness or potentially hazardous chemicals. The other feature of early pregnancy, a sudden aversion to certain foods, might also be part of the natural machinery of foetus protection. But researchers find it harder to make generalisations about the effect on embryos in the first few days of life because most do not survive: 80% perish naturally.</p>",

There are various scare stories coming out that are causing people to overreact, like telling people to get all the food, water and medication they need because it s going to be like world war three.

  "New evidence that high voltage power lines cause cancer by making particles of pollution stick to people's lungs has been uncovered by a team from Bristol University. <p>The team's research shows that car exhaust particles get an electrical charge from overhead power lines that makes them \"sticky\" - giving people living close to the lines two or three times the average daily dose of potentially damaging pollutants in their lungs. </p> <p>David Henshaw of Bristol University said the discovery is the missing link that shows how power lines can cause cancer clusters - something the global electricity industry has spent millions of pounds researching without finding a conclusive answer. </p> <p>His work is supported by Dr Alan Preece at the Bristol Medical School, whose independent research in the west country showed that people living up to 500 metres downwind of power lines have a 29% greater chance of contracting lung cancer. This finding matches the area where \"sticky\" particles from car exhausts drift downwind of power cables. </p> <p>Both men believe that building new houses near power cables, or allowing new power lines near houses should be stopped until their research is investigated. A ban already exists in US and Sweden. </p> <p>The scientists have been backed by William Hague, the Tory leader. Northallerton, in his constituency, has an unexplained cancer cluster next to a power line. </p> <p>Work to find a link between power lines and cancer has been going on for 20 years, but scientists have been studying a different possible cause - the effect of the magnetic field created by the lines. </p> <p>What Prof Henshaw's team found was not a direct effect on the body, but an indirect mechanical effect, which allowed the build up of pollutants in the lungs. </p> <p>Measurements taken all over the UK and Europe showed that all power lines were surrounded by a corona of electrically charged ions. The older and rougher the lines, the greater the corona. Ions from the corona were carried downwind of the lines, attaching themselves to up to 15,000 particles per cubic metre of pollution floating past in the air. </p> <p>The ions gave the particles an electrical charge and made them stick to surfaces. When they got into the capillaries in the lungs they were attracted to the surface and stuck. </p> <p>Prof Henshaw said: \"This would not happen if the lines were buried. We have the technology to do it , it is just more expensive.\" </p> <p>Dr Preece, an epidemiologist in the oncology department at Bristol will tell Radio 4's Costing the Earth programme today that he looked at the incidence of cancer in the whole of the south-west of England to judge the relative risk for those living within 400 metres of power lines. </p> <p>\"We found an excess, particularly lung cancer, in that group of people, who had been living within 400 metres of a line at the time of diagnosis.\" He said the most surprising element was the cancers only occurred downwind. </p> <p>Dr Preece would not discuss his findings in detail until they had been reviewed by other scientists but a report to the Bioelectromagnetics Society in Munich earlier this year said the excess was 29% - and that had taken into account the effects of smoking. </p> <p>Mr Hague said that in his constituency he had eight cases of childhood leukaemia, liver cancer and other illnesses near a power line. After meeting Prof Henshaw, he said: \"In respect to construction of new lines, National Grid should look carefully at new evidence before going ahead with more.\" </p> <p>Dr John Swanson, scientific advisor to the National Grid, and advisor on electric and magnetic fields for the Electricity Association said he accepted that Prof Henshaw had shown that power cables affected airborne particles. \"I do not believe he has shown that has a consequence for health.\" </p> <p>\"We have never said in a categorical way that power lines are safe, that simply would not be honest. What we say is that when you look at the totality of studies you come to the conclusion that the balance of evidence is that power lines do not have an effect on health.\"</p>",
  "For well over a century the Irish have been doing the world's dirty work, leaving in their tens of thousands to build Britain's motorways, work on Australia's farms or serve in the bars of America. <p>But after a decade of breathtaking economic growth, Ireland finds itself in an unfamiliar position - it is running out of workers. With unemployment close to zero, the government estimates it will need to attract 200,000 people to its workforce in the next six years to sustain its boom. </p> <p>In a historical twist, it is to the vast Irish diaspora that the country is now turning. On Saturday the Irish government's training and employment agency, Fas, will launch a global recruitment tour in Manchester, offering access to 50,000 vacancies in the republic. Over four months the tour will go from Newfoundland to New Zealand, via Birmingham, London and Sydney, in an attempt to address an employment shortage that one Dublin recruiter yesterday described as desperate. </p> <p>The reversal in Ireland's economic fortunes could scarcely be more spectacular. In 1993 unemployment was running at 16%, and as recently as 1988 60,000 people were leaving the country each year to find work. That trend has reversed: last year 42,000 people moved to Ireland, 7,000 of them from the UK. But according to the Economic and Social Research Institute, an independent Dublin think tank, even if the country's double digit growth should slow in the next few years as many economists are predicting, the Celtic Tiger will still need fresh meat. </p> <p>Recruitment levels have reached particularly critical levels in five industries: communications, information technology, construction, the health services, and hospitality and catering. </p> <p>\"Companies over here are becoming more desperate,\" said Alan O'Rafferty of Atlanco, a Dublin recruitment consultancy specialising in the construction industry. \"It could be said that some companies are at breaking point if they don't get the staff. They don't ring us any longer and say, 'We want this and this,' they just ring and say, 'We want to see anything you have got.' It is entirely an employee's market.\" </p> <p>Louise Fisher, a personal assistant at a Dublin construction firm, moved from Manchester this year. She had made two weekend trips to the republic, was impressed by the opportunities on offer, and decided to move on a trial basis. </p> <p>\"I flew over on Monday, and on the same day I had interviews with two employment agencies,\" said Ms Fisher, 36. \"I had been offered my job by Wednesday, I flew home on Thursday to pack, and started my new job the following Monday. </p> <p>\"There's so much work out there it's unbelievable. I am now seriously considering settling here, because you can really pick and choose your career.\" </p> <p>Dermod O'Byrne, the events manager at Fas, who is coordinating the tour, said the initiative had started as an attempt to encourage Irish exiles to come back but was then widened to include those whose families were of Irish origin. </p> <p>All such restrictions have now been abandoned - the tour will also take in Berlin, Prague and even Ljubljana in Slovenia. Any workers who were \"job ready, skilled and experienced\", were welcome to apply, he said. </p> <p>\"We are going to a number of locations, and in each we will try to identify beforehand the market skills that may be available. Once we know what's available we know which employers to bring with us.\" </p> <p>But he said the agency was sensitive to suggestions that it was attempting to poach workers. \"We say we're only borrowing our cousins for a little while, and they can have them back later if they want to return.\"</p>",
  "<p>Sir Richard Branson has turned the thrust of his Virgin Mobile business across the Atlantic with plans to launch an assault on the US mobile phone market. </p> <p>The company is understood to be holding discussions with US networks AT&amp;T, Voicestream and Sprint in the hope of setting up a joint venture modelled on the existing British business. </p> <p>Virgin Mobile in Britain is a 50/50 split between Virgin and One2One. </p> <p>The negotiations with the US networks are described as being at an advanced stage. </p> <p>Virgin Mobile has opened an office in San Francisco and appointed former McKinsey consultant John Tantum to run the US operation. </p> <p>Since the agreement with One2One was signed last year, Virgin has brokered similar agreements with Singapore Telecom to expand the business throughout South-east Asia and with Cable &amp; Wire less Optus in Australia. Mr Tantum said the company was seeking an equity relationship in the US but declined to comment on individual negotiations. </p> <p>\"We've talked to all the operators in the US and there is a high level of interest,\" he said. \"We are engaged with a number of operators and in some cases in fairly detailed negotiations about what sort of relationship Virgin will have with a network operator.\" </p> <p>The deal with Singapore Telecom saw the Asian busi ness injecting $450m and Virgin contributing a further $50m. </p> <p>\"We are very likely to have an equity relationship with a carrier,\" Mr Tantum added. \"The appealing thing of the 50-50 arrangement to us is that it aligns the incentives. We both have the same interests in making the company successful.\" </p> <p>The US presents a vastly lucrative opportunity with current penetration rates far lower than in most parts of Europe. The development of the industry in the US was hampered by a system whereby the recipient of a call paid the bill and by the failure to agree a standard technology across the country. </p> <p>The lack of a national operator may make it difficult, however, for Virgin to achieve its ambition of becoming a player across the length and breadth of the US. </p> <p>Sir Richard has outlined hopes of developing a global mobile brand and the business has become one of the main focuses of the Virgin empire. He recently sold a stake in his flagship Virgin Atlantic airline to fund investments in mobile phones and the internet. </p> <p>Virgin Mobile UK, which began last November, claims to have signed up 400,000 customers. The company introduced an integrated MP3 mobile phone earlier this month. </p> <p>The Virgin brand name is less well known in the US where its most high profile business is its chain of 20 Megastores - the group's music retailer. Other ventures in cluding Virgin Cola have proved less successful. </p> <p>In the US, the mobile business will target a younger market than the UK, aiming at 15-to 30-year-olds. </p> <p>At home, Sir Richard will discover today whether his bid for the National Lottery will face a renewed challenge from incumbent operator Camelot. A verdict is due in the high court in the judicial review of the National Lottery Commission's decision to negotiate exclusively with Sir Richard's People's Lottery.</p>",
  "<p>There are two ways into Apocalypse, the much-discussed new exhibition at the Royal Academy. You can either walk in, or you can crawl. Norman Rosenthal, co-curator of this exhibition with Max Wigram, invited me to take the latter route. Concertinaed through a grubby, cramped little hatch on my hands and knees, I found myself in a narrow, dank, rubbish-strewn and dimly lit maze. Unsure which way to go, ducking and bungling my way through, I turned and turned again, following what little light there was. Poking my head into a cement-lined cell, I found myself reflected between greasy mirrors, a head in a grim void. Moving on, crab-wise, I finally wormed my way out. </p> <p>This is not so much a habitation or an art installation as a model of an artist's mind, his ever inward-digging bolt hole. Gregor Schneider's Cellar (1985-99) is a version of the house where he lives in Germany, a house he has altered and goes on altering all the time, constructing within it hidden rooms, false windows, spaces within spaces. It is a series of illusions and traps, a sinister lair. How the artist lives, one can only imagine with reluctance and trepidation. There is apparently a room in Schneider's house whose sound-proofed door can be opened neither from within nor from without, should it slam behind you. </p> <p>There is a way out here, a stumble into the larger space of the darkened gallery that contains Schneider's structure. Did the air-kiss-and-tell socialites at Monday's exclusive Prada party at the Royal Academy snag their rags on the rough concrete, rip their tights and spoil their creases on the dirty floor of Schneider's contribution to the show? Heavens, I do hope so. Did the conversation pall in the room where the Holocaust happens, the table-top world that Jake and Dinos Chapman have spent two years making, corpse by corpse, violation by violation? I have no doubt. Nor that the cognoscenti parked their expensive behinds on the polished wooden slatted seats of Darren Almond's shiny glass-and-aluminium bus shelters, which are eventually to be installed in Auschwitz. Almond's work is expressive because of its normality, its hygiene, its cleanliness, its sense of forgetting. </p> <p>Mike Kelley's installation, on the other hand, is a false memory, a reconstruction of the photo of a play in a high-school yearbook. The original photograph is scary in itself, and Kelley has upped the ante, producing a perfect simulacrum of the set - a dingy room containing a rumpled bed, a stupid sculpture on a plinth, an oven with an open door. He has also produced a play, shown on video, whose two participants, closely modelled on the original photo, act out a dark and funny two-hander. Like Endgame, or Steptoe and Son, or Joseph Losey's 1963 film The Servant, the play acts out two lives trapped in the room. It deserves several viewings. It is mannered, twisted, obscene and hilarious. Suicide, Sylvia Plath, ass-fondling, power games and art are its subjects, all done in an early-sitcom style. </p> <p>Like Jeff Koons's work, and like Richard Prince's paintings with stupid old jokes stencilled on them, Kelley's installation digs into the familiar world of the American banal. Whether Kelley wants to be heir to Edward Albee or David Mamet is another matter. Bleak as hell, made bleaker yet by its hilarity and ponderous cliches, Kelley's work has a lightness that most of the rest of the show tries for but can't quite manage. </p> <p>In Chris Cunningham's new video installation Flex, life and death and sex are given a booming Aphex Twin soundtrack. Bodies are beautiful, against interstellar smoky blackness. It is terribly compelling and exciting, but where does it leave us? Looking at a woman with her mouth mashed in and red with blood from a man's punch. His foreskin peeled back in close-up, prelude to an atavistic fuck. It is as though Cunningham was trying to live up to the show's full title, Apocalypse: Beauty and Horror in Contemporary Art. </p> <p>Looking at Wolfgang Tillmans's photo of a rose, a rose bleeding red into its white background, I cannot but find it, in the context of Apocalypse, sick, like Blake's rose, like a bloom of blood on a sheet, the tell-tale fleck in the sputum. Tillmans's virulent towering cloudscapes, updating John Martin's eschato- logical 18th-century paintings, are born of aeroplane-window views, stains in the developing tank. In the age of Aids (from which Tillmans's lover died) maybe his work is about grabbing beauty where you can, holding on to moments, seeing beauty or the poignant in the simplest things. The tenderness of his images shines through. </p> <p>As does the malaise in Luc Tuymans's paintings. The reddish-green light, the shapelessness of his rendering of pillows, the bare bulbs dangling in Lamproom, the banality of his image of a folkloric festival, are all some way repulsive. His painting of a cloth embroidered with stilted leaves and flowers, tobacco-stained yellow and hopeless (they have, like Lady Bertram's needlepoint in Mansfield Park, little wit and no beauty) points to the same thing: a sort of disgustedness. They deal, in a certain way, with corruption, in which the bourgeois taste for painting is implicated. There is a deceptive relationship between the image and the manner of its articulation, the work's actual subject and its motif. </p> <p>Maurizio Cattelan's joke sculpture of the Pope, a life-size and realistic sculpture of the pontiff floored by a meteor that appears to have crashed through the glass roof of the gallery, may be found offensive. This act of Cattelan - not God, nor an indifferent universe - is no more troubling, nor funnier, than many of the cartoons one finds in newspapers in Catholic countries. Impeccably staged, it presents a very old kind of apocalyptic vision - of horsemen and fires in the sky, heavenly portents and divine retribution - that we might have thought had disappeared. Yet only this week a Liberal Democrat was promoting a Star Wars offensive against falling rocks and cosmic debris. Plus \u00e7a change - Cattelan's work is a see-once-then-forget-it gag. That so much effort has gone into it renders it monumentally absurd. </p> <p>Tim Noble and Sue Webster's spotlit pile of rubbish bags and detritus casts a shadow image of the artists on the wall - as a prelapsarian couple on a country hillside. Like Mike Leigh's Nuts in May, or Beckett's ever more hopeless peregrinations through bogs and corncrake-inhabited fields, this tableau associates the bucolic with the road to heaven or hell. A road, in this case, paved not with good intentions, but with pure crap. And what are the couple thinking, up there on the hill? I imagine their heads filled with air, or with the endlessly spinning images in Angus Fairhurst's hand-drawn film animation, with its mesmerising cycle of proliferating forms, which wheel, wiggle, multiply and mutate. The forms become overlaid as they turn, ending up with a rotating circle of jumbled black scribble. Being mesmerised can be trance-like and transcendental, which I guess has a kind of beauty in it. Or it can be distressingly repetitive, like an inner voice saying the same thing again and again till you'd chop your own head off to make it stop. Or the whole experience can be merely irritating, and watching Fairhurst becomes a scopophilic version of picking at a scab. His work makes you want to run amok through the galleries, beating other visitors about the head with your Acoustiguide. Time for my medication. </p> <p>The works that - I can only guess - are intended to show a modern idea of beauty are at best horribly pretty. I was too tall to crouch in a praying position in Mariko Mori's high-tech, translucent pagoda, and had to sit with my knees somewhere up about my ears as though I were straining on a potty. Before me, on a curved, womb-like screen, water rose and fell, rain twinkled, jewelly little shapes flickered and swam. This 3-D multimedia experience (you'll have to queue, probably for hours) is all the more tiresome and pathetic for the effort that has gone into it. It bought out the inner child in me, the one that wants to smash things up. </p> <p>Ditto Jeff Koons's paintings of kiddy toys in their world of popcorn, plastic smiles and gaily coloured balloons. This is a heaven made of Mylar. It is impossible to know whether Koons is celebrating childhood's world of grimacing, wide-eyed plastic, or if he is telling us something about the horror of our formative, Toys R Us years. </p> <p> His room comes directly after Hell, the Chapmans' concentration camp diorama, in which mutants run the camp, and the Nazis are the victims. One traces a thread between Koons's infantilism (which makes us realise that children don't inherently like this stuff, but have it imposed on them by adults) and the pre- adolescent grisliness and black humour of the Chapmans' evil world. Hell is a grotesque spectacle of the unconscionable. So too, we must remind ourselves, is Schindler's List. Spielberg's attempt to be sensitive was as meaningless as the Chapmans' impulse to horrify and entertain, which at least has the merit of honesty about our voyeuristic urges. Dealing with the Holocaust as imagery for art, the movies, or literature is inevitably difficult. Hell is saved - if salvation has any meaning here - by the gags, the ludicrousness of it, the impossibility of treating its subject fully and truthfully, without becoming mawkish, mendacious or prurient. The Chapmans' answer is to go too far, which is perhaps not even far enough. </p> <p>In his 1967 book on the apocalypse, The Sense of an Ending, Frank Kermode observed that it is only the outward signs of apocalypse that have changed with the centuries, and that its threat has always been felt to be imminent. \"It is commonplace to talk about our historical situation as uniquely terrible,\" he wrote, \"but can it really be so? Many of [our predecessors] felt as we do. If the evidence looks good to us, so it did to them. Perhaps if we have a terrible privilege, it is merely that we are alive and are going to die, all at once or one at a time.\" This is either itself a common-place, or it is profound. It only matters if this knowledge helps us live more fully. If this show is anything, it is also either banal or profound. Perhaps it is both, but not always in the way it was intended. </p> <p>Apocalypse is at the Royal Academy, London W1 (020-7300 8000), from Saturday to December 15.</p>",
  "As Charles Kennedy put the finishing touches to today's party conference speech in Bournemouth a trusted ally was asked if the genial Liberal Democrat leader is really hungry enough to be a successful modern politician. <p>\"Of course, Charles is hungry, he's very ambitious. He wants to be prime minister,\" his colleague replied. The answer will surprise critics in the Lib Dem ranks who feel that Kennedy has not hit the ground running as fast as they would wish in the year since he succeeded the energetic Paddy Ashdown. </p> <p>After Action Man, Inaction Man. \"Where's the bloody strategy, Paddy had a strategy for everything, even lunch,\" the critics murmur. Today's speech must address that concern, MPs agree. There will be affection, but it will be tempered with expectation: solid policy thoughts, some inspiration and strategic direction. </p> <p>Mr Kennedy refuses to be panicked. \"I'm not going to do a William Hague. I'd rather people accuse me of having a low profile while my popularity goes up than have a high profile making a fool of myself while my popularity goes down,\" he tells his staff. </p> <p>Mr Hague, at 39, a year his junior, has been an important factor in Mr Kennedy's first year. He privately admits it would have been harder finding political space for the Lib Dems with John Major or Kenneth Clarke as Tory leader. Mr Hague's populist lurch to the right - on crime, asylum, tax-and-spend - has genuinely angered Mr Kennedy. </p> <p>It did not stop him inviting William and Ffion to dine at his Westminster flat with girlfriend Sarah Gurling to establish better personal rapport. Fortunately they turned him down. That was before the sensational byelection capture of Romsey by Sandra Gidley which cheered the activists. </p> <p>This week's conference has (as so often) been overshadowed by dramas in the world beyond Bournemouth. But even here Mr Kennedy has been lucky. Furious with Tony Blair, voters have not all swung to the Tories. Half Labour's defectors have parked their votes with the Lib Dems, giving them poll ratings of 21% (NOP) and 22% (Guardian/ICM). </p> <p>Lib Dem strategists believe it is a blip which will subside, but it is a handy blip, one which will still send them into the coming campaign with a higher base line and give some credibility to what will be the key theme of Mr Kennedy's speech at lunchtime. </p> <p>It will be aimed at \"One Nation\" moderate Tories in the south where 50 potential Romseys lurk, provided they are not frightened off by tax-and-spend. </p> <p>Even allowing for luck and bullish polls, what is surprising in Bournemouth this week is how little backbiting there has been among activists who like nothing better than to dwell on the shortcomings of whoever happens to be their leader. When one such sceptic, Lord Russell, dined the other night with MP Robert Maclennan, they agreed - to their surprise - that \"Charles hasn't put a foot wrong\". </p> <p>\"I haven't felt happier in the party for years,\" confided Mr Maclennan, Mr Kennedy's Highland neighbour. The historian in Lord Russell, often a thorn in Paddy Ashdown's flesh, believes that \"Charles has a Gladstonian instinct for good timing and for the centre of gravity in his party. Any decision he takes will be in the interests of the party\". </p> <p>That last phrase is a dig at Mr Ashdown's obsession with Lib-Labbery and the joint consultative committee (JCC) he formed with Tony Blair - albeit without getting either of the promised referendums, on the euro or electoral reform for Westminster. One of Mr Kennedy's tasks this past year has been what aides call \"a gentle distancing\" from the JCC, ready to fight Labour hard in the election, but done without a fuss. </p> <p>A few delegates complain that Mr Kennedy privately promised to get more out of Mr Blair. They also say that he may be good at doing media, but lacks drive or organisational skills. </p> <p>Policy needed a shake-up when he inherited the leadership. They had even slipped on the environment where Lib Dems were once ahead of the game. Europe, another key policy area, was frustrating for different reasons, Labour's caution on the euro. </p> <p>Those fields, plus a strong commitment to good public services and a Highlander's gut instinct for social justice are what will distinguish the Lib Dem manifesto. </p> <p>But Mr Kennedy's hold on his party also rests on the tours he has made of the grassroots and the \"more open and collegiate, less military\" style he has adopted among Commons colleagues. </p> <p>His most nervous moment in the past year was his appearance at the Cenotaph on Remembrance Sunday. Mr Kennedy is old enough to remember the fury over Michael Foot's duffle coat appearance in 1981. Notoriously parsimonious about clothes (\"I've been trying to get him out of \u00a399 suits,\" says one aide) he went out and bought a \u00a3500 overcoat. </p> <p>Optimistic talk of winning an extra 50 seats is just that. Mr Kennedy (always a byelection pessimist) believes he can do better than the current 47 seats, but his chief interest is in positioning Lib Dem candidates in second place, not third place, with an eye to the general election of 2005.</p>",
  "<p>When Lord Melchett, former Labour minister, working farmer and head of Greenpeace UK, arrived at remote Walnut Tree farm, near Lyng, Norfolk, with 27 others just before dawn on July 26 last year, he knew the environmental group had just a few minutes to destroy the six acre GM maize crop being grown by the three Brigham brothers for seed company Agrevo. </p> <p>With luck, the farm machinery they had brought would work faultlessly, the police would be alerted too late and the \"polluting\" maize would be bagged up and on its way back to the company's head office in King's Lynn before anyone could stop them. </p> <p>The first half of the operation went to plan. Lord Melchett had set off at night from his family farm, some 30 miles away at Ringstead, Norfolk, with an industrial crop cutter on the back of a wagon. Most of the other Greenpeace members had travelled there from London in two minibuses. </p> <p>The rendezvous was near the GM field at 5am. By the time Lord Melchett arrived, the 27 volunteers - who included nine Greenpeace staff and supporters from all over Britain including a Baptist minister - were waiting behind a hedge. </p> <p><strong> Decontamination suits</strong><br> </p> <p> Within seconds, the padlock on the gate barring the GM trial field had been cut, lorry and cutting machine had gone in, followed by the volunteers all dressed in white \"decontamination\" suits. The gate was immediately re-padlocked and Melchett spent an infuriating few minutes trying to set up the machinery. </p> <p>What Greenpeace had not counted on was the alertness and the anger of the Brigham brothers and their determination to protect their crop. Within seconds of the environment group's cutter speeding through the field like a whirling dervish, the three brothers were heading from the farmhouse towards the field on foot and by tractors. </p> <p>The meeting was short but epic. There were moments of real drama and danger for the volunteers and the clash was described as a confrontation between outsiders and locals, with Greenpeace being alternately hailed by the anti-GM lobby and condemned by government and most of the media. </p> <p>William Brigham tried to physically stop the volunteers who had immediately begun cutting the crop by hand and putting it into bags. Meanwhile, John and Eddie Brigham were turning their tractors into mobile battering rams. </p> <p>The two Greenpeace minibuses were damaged. As one brother on his Massey Ferguson ambushed the Greenpeace cutter on its second revolution round the field, striking it down with one blow of his front end loader, another was slamming a heavy JCB-type shovel on top of the Greenpeace lorry preventing it moving. </p> <p>Within 10 minutes, the Greenpeace action was effectively over, with only the volunteers left cutting by hand. At most, one sixth of the field which was about to flower and pollinate, causing what Lord Melchett said would be \"inevitable pollution\", had been cut down. </p> <p>The brothers had caused an estimated \u00a35,000 of damage to the Greenpeace machinery and Greenpeace had caused about \u00a3650 of damage to the crop. </p> <p>The police arrived at about 5.30am. By this time one of the Brighams was speeding round the field in his tractor in pursuit of anyone in a white suit and the volunteers were hiding or throwing themselves deep into the maize to avoid injury, </p> <p><strong> Ecological arguments</strong><br> </p> <p> As the police moved in to arrest Greenpeace members and lead them to relative safety, the political and ecological arguments started. William Brigham confronted Lord Melchett, accusing him of being a criminal: \"I find it amazing that a man calling himself a democrat and is a former government minister sees fit to take the law into his own hands.\" </p> <p>Lord Melchett said: \"This is decontamination of the countryside. This crop shouldn't be grown. We are doing something that the public wants and is for the benefit of the environment.\" He added that Greenpeace was trying to protect other farmers. </p> <p>William Brigham argued that he, rather than Lord Melchett, was working for the community, and that he and his brothers were acting in an ecologically responsible way. </p> <p>\"I wanted to trial these crops to see if there were any downsides,\" he said. </p> <p>Within hours, the Greenpeace 28 had been driven off and Lord Melchett was preparing to spend two nights in Norwich prison after being refused bail.</p>",
  "<p>Yesterday's verdict acquitting 28 Greenpeace protesters of criminal damage to a field of GM crops is likely to have ramifications far beyond the confines of Norwich crown court. </p> <p>According to Charles Secret, director of Friends of the Earth, the jury's decision could spell disaster for the government's plans to increase the number of genetically modified farm scale crop trials. \"As far as I can see this throws the door open for people to legitimately destroy GM crops that are about to go to pollen. </p> <p>Under government plans, trials in 25 fields for maize and oilseed rape and 30 more for either sugar or fodder beet are due to get under way by the end of this year, with more farm-scale trials planned for next year and in 2002 before the results are fully evaluated in 2003. </p> <p>A total of 75 participating farms are needed over the next three years for a viable study, but even before yesterday's verdict, doubt had been cast on the government's ability to recruit enough farms, a fact confirmed by the National Farmers Union yesterday. </p> <p>\"It is vital that any farmers involved in future trials are better protected or of course they are not going to want to take part,\" a spokesman said. \"We are extremely shocked and angered by the verdict. This is about criminal damage to farmers' crops and has distressing implications for all farmers.\" </p> <p>In March, two weeks after the government announced the location of 31 farms in England and Scotland that had signed up for the trials, two of the farms pulled out under pressure from local people. Greenpeace has also issued a hit list of 26 farms it says are taking part in the trials. </p> <p>The government had issued only a six-figure grid reference to identify the fields where the trials are due to take place, but anti-GM campaigners will be hoping that the jury's decision in the Greenpeace case will trigger a domino effect, with more farmers deciding to boycott the trials. </p> <p>Although the jury's verdict does not set a precedent for future cases, legal experts said yesterday that a number of similar verdicts would probably see the crown prosecution service re-evaluating whether to bring similar cases to trial. </p> <p>Yesterday the Department of Environment Transport and the Regions was adamant the trials would continue. \"If we halted our strictly controlled research then there would be widespread GM crop planting, without us getting the real scientific evidence we need,\" the department said in a statement. \"Our priority is to protect the environment and human health. These farm scale evaluations are vital for us to assess whether there are any unacceptable effects.\"</p>",
  "<p>New regulator <strong> Philip Fletcher</strong> has signalled that he favours a substantial restructuring of the industry less than two months after succeeding <strong> Sir Ian Byatt</strong> , the former <strong> Ofwat</strong> chief. Shares in the sector have fallen 50% since their peak two years ago - not least because Sir Ian imposed average price cuts of 12% and hefty capital spending targets to improve the environment in his last review. That settlement prompted arethink. <strong> Kelda</strong> announced plans this year to return <strong> Yorkshire </strong> to its original owners, its customers, and make it a debt-financed mutual. Sir Ian scotched that idea but variants are known to have been considered by <strong> Anglian</strong> and <strong> Pennon</strong> , or <strong> South-west Water</strong> . Mr Fletcher, former receiver for the <strong> Metropolitan Police</strong> and an <strong> environment department</strong> official, has said he favours separating ownership of water and sewage assets from their operation. The idea lay at the heart of the bidding war between <strong> Nomura</strong> and <strong> WPD</strong> for control of multi-utility <strong> Hyder</strong> , won by US-owned WPD last month. WPD plans to retain the assets of Hyder's <strong> Welsh Water </strong> but hand over operations to Warrington-based <strong> United Utilities</strong> . <strong> Severn Trent</strong> has challenged this in the high court, where the case will be heard today. Mr Fletcher has upset the status quo by endorsing such schemes: his remarks have been seen as the catalyst for the announcement from <strong> Thames Water</strong> . But he said yesterday he would like Ofwat to move from being a \"facilitator\" to a \"promoter\". </p>",
  "<p>Could it really have been so simple? Not so long ago, a couple of guys would come up with an idea for an internet start-up, have a lot of cash thrown at them to buy brand recognition, and as much time as they wanted in which to become profitable. Taking their cue from the US, most dot.com companies over here tried to get one round of seed funding followed by two or three rounds of venture capital to tide them over until flotation. </p> <p>Not any more. As venture capital becomes thinner on the ground and valuations of floated start-ups consistently fail to set the market alight as they once did, the \"trade sale\" is back in fashion. Selling off the business is fast becoming part of the long-term plan, rather than a necessary measure after suffering bankruptcy further down the line. </p> <p>In the summer, an ill wind began blowing away the prospects of many a UK and European dot.com company. Boo.com, ClickMango, ToyCity and most recently Dressmart.com all joined the growing list of start-ups running out of cash, as PriceWaterhouseCoopers promised many would, in its report in May. </p> <p>Now, more research published by the management consultancy last week suggests time is also running out for start-ups to fulfil any aspirations of growth and market share, as the period allowed for profitability begins to shrink rapidly. \"Dot.coms are no longer able to coast along on the promise of profits without making any money,\" the report says. \"While this pressure has been growing for some time and there have been some high-profile dot.com failures, many are only now realising they are soon to be judged on a traditional price/earnings ratio. The time-scale is three years and closing.\" </p> <p>Many have begun to recognise that only a trade sale will put them in a position to cope with these new demands, and this summer has seen a number of high-profile deals. </p> <p>First Tuesday, the networking organisation responsible for galvanising so many dot.com ideas on this side of the Atlantic, was sold to an Israeli venture underwriter, Yazam, in July for $50m. </p> <p>Co-founder John Browning, says the company decided to sell despite offers of venture capital, because the prospect of faster growth via an established infrastructure was so attractive. \"The sale gave us more global offices, in-house expertise and more product offerings. We could have tried this on our own, but it would have taken a year. And in this market, a year is a long time.\" </p> <p>It also meant bypassing the ordeal of having its intangible services put through the City wringer to seek a subjective valuation. Browning says many industry watchers missed the point and accused First Tuesday of \"selling out\", rather than just selling. </p> <p>Somehow, amid the hype of the e-commerce explosion, a myth got written into industry folklore: nothing less than an initial public offering will do. The IPO would be the exit strategy of choice, converting the founders' paper millions into real ones and returning the venture capitalists' stake - plus some. </p> <p>However, a focus on US trends, encouragement from investment banks, venture capitalists and incubators plus hype from the press all played a part in sustaining this myth. </p> <p> Robert Conway of PriceWaterhouseCoopers financial advisory services agrees. \"In Silicon Valley, everyone wants to float on Nasdaq. Six months ago everyone thought that would happen here. Now the bubble has burst, you can't IPO a company without a robust revenue stream.\" </p> <p>A company that came to exemplify the trials and tribulations of bringing a start-up to market is the UK video-on-demand provider, Yes TV. In April, following the correction in telecoms media and technology stocks, it twice put off a \u00a3560m flotation on the Stock Exchange. Forced to cut the intended flotation price by 30%, it scrapped the offering the following month, just two days before trading was scheduled to commence. </p> <p>Similarly, Chello Broadband, the internet service provider owned by Dutch cable company United Pan-Europe Communications, spent months preparing to float on the Amsterdam stock exchange, then opted for a merger with the non-US assets of Excite, in July. </p> <p>But for <a href=\"http://www.ace-quote.com\" target=\"_new\">Ace-Quote</a>, an UK-based online marketplace for the IT and telecoms industries, the decision to sell came much earlier. It was first approached just before Christmas by DCI, a successful German company, operating in the same industry and listed on the Neuer Markt exchange, after only six months' trading, and while still searching for first round venture capital. The founders finally gave in to DCI's advances in May for \u00a333m. </p> <p>\"We never got to the VC part,\" recalls Helga St Blaize, co-founder of Ace-Quote. \"But we certainly saw how difficult it was going to be to get funding. We knew dot.coms would have to start behaving in a grown-up fashion.\" This desire to be seen to be grown-up has prompted others to consider a trade sale, an option sought by both private and already floated companies, particularly the rapidly consolidating European internet service provider sector. </p> <p>Enter World Online. The Dutch ISP that floated on the exchange steeped in ignominy in March, saw its shares dive from their initial \u20ac 43 to as little as \u20ac 10 in May, after it emerged that founder Nina Brink had sold a substantial part of her stake before the IPO. Now the loss-making ISP is considering an offer from Italian giant Tiscali. </p> <p>Gerry Montanus, senior partner at Atlas Ventures, sees both offensive and defensive trade sales as a growing consideration over the coming year. \"It is more of a challenge now than in the past, to get private funding. For listed companies with high market capitalisation, it will be advantageous to them to pick up companies operating in areas they want to access.\"</p>",
  "<p>Winter in the Antarctic , the coldest and windiest place on earth. Millions of kilometres of sea remain frozen all year, but as temperatures plummet, up to 20 million square kilometres of ocean - an area twice the size of the USA - are covered with a white layer of ice. </p> <p>The ice may appear barren, but a closer look reveals a multitude of microbial life. Small as they are, these microbes exert an influence over the whole Southern Ocean, and may control the destiny of penguins and seals thousands of miles away. The loss of their habitat, the ice, through global warming, could have devastating consequences. </p> <p>To understand this story, stop looking at things from a warm-blooded human perspective - we wouldn't last long in that cold - and think small. For the microbes that get trapped in the ice, it's not a bad place to be. </p> <p>Temperatures on the ice surface can reach -30C, but on the underside it is a relatively hospitable -1.8C, free from wind and currents. The microbes of this region can function well at freezing temperatures, often as actively as organisms in far warmer waters. </p> <p>\"Ice algae\" were formally described more than 150 years ago. Any passenger on an ice- breaking ship would notice the brown and green layers on the underside of ice that had broken up.But these organisms were not thought to be an important part of the ecology of Polar seas, and attention focused on the algal blooms in the open ocean. </p> <p>As the sea begins to freeze, algae become attached to the growing ice crystals and get concentrated as the ice forms. The majority of the algae live in channels of brine formed when salt gets squeezed out as the water freezes, giving rise to salt concentrations five times higher than seawater. </p> <p>Only a tiny fraction of the light hitting the surface of the ice reaches the bottom, where the majority of the algae live, so the organisms must be well adapted to high salt concentrations and low light. </p> <p>The ice is home to a diverse and complex ecosystem, composed of more than 200 species of algae, as well as a massive diversity of bacteria, viruses, protozoa and higher organisms such as amphipods and even flatworms. It is a mini-ecosystem in a frozen sponge. </p> <p>Algae are microscopic plants that use the sun's light to harvest carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. When spring approaches, the algal population explodes on a diet of sunlight and minerals from the sea. British Antarctic Survey biologist Simon Brockington says: \"Diving in the middle of winter, the new ice is pristine white. Later in the year it can be like looking up at a field of grass.\" </p> <p>The area of the southern sea-ice far exceeds that of the Antarctic continent, covering an area up to two and a half times the size of Australia. That's a very large meadow. </p> <p>As the algae bloom, they suck in millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide which they convert into carbon. This is an important process in the global carbon cycle, and scientists estimate that the ice algae account for 5% of the total amount of carbon trapped through photosynthesis in this region. </p> <p>Algae are the fuel for the entire southern ocean ecosystem because, like grass, they are grazed by bigger creatures. They sustain the most important Antarctic marine food resource, the small shrimplike krill. Krill can graze the underside of the ice at an amazing rate, clearing a 20cm square in five minutes, says Peter Marshall at the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar Marine Research. Krill are the main meal for many predators such as penguins, seals and whales. </p> <p>Twenty years ago, prior to comprehensive research into the sea-ice, it was assumed that krill were fed by the summer algal bloom in the open water, then hibernated on the sea floor in winter. However, scuba divers under the winter sea-ice off the Antarctic Peninsula saw krill nibbling the ice-algae which were still present in the ice. </p> <p>Two thousands of miles north east of the Antarctic Peninsula, on the island of South Georgia, British Antarctic Survey scientists were studying creatures at the opposite end of the food chain, penguins and fur seals. Three or four times a decade they observed terrible years for breeding, with few pups or chicks surviving. Feeding studies showed that the lean years for these creatures were also lean years for the krill, with no juvenile krill in the water. Krill are not only important for wildlife, but for commercial fisheries too. So it was vital to find out what was causing these slumps. </p> <p>For answers, scientists looked to the Antarctic Peninsula, a major breeding ground for krill and the possible source of the South Georgia krill. A strong relationship was observed between the extent of sea-ice and the krill numbers. In years when the climate reduced the ice cover near the Antarctic Peninsula, krill production slumped. So the icy pastures of the ice-algae may be having a huge impact on the ecology of the whole Southern Ocean. </p> <p>Biologist Robin Ross of the Marine Science Institute, University of California, thinks that without the winter pasture krill \"wouldn't be able to live through winter\". </p> <p>If normal climatic conditions were having such a profound impact on Southern Ocean ecology through sea-ice formation, what havoc could global warming cause? </p> <p>Warmer temperatures can mean thinner sea-ice, which, says biologist William Ambrose of Bates College USA, \"is likely to promote lux uriant growth of algae\", based on observations from thin sea-ice years in the Arctic. </p> <p>Ironically more algae mean less ice. Being dark, ice-algae absorb heat from the sun more than the ice that surrounds them, speeding up melting and pitting the ice with a honeycomb of large pores. But if atmospheric warming reduces the area of sea-ice, the future could be bleak for penguins, seals and the fishing industry. \"If global warming caused low ice extent for three out of four years\" says Ross, \"there could be a serious problem for krill survival.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Dr Alison George is a microbiologist with the British Antarctic Survey in Cambridge .</p>"
