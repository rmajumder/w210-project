  "<p>'You couldn't stay on an extra hour tonight, could you?\" may once have been a genuine one-off plea. But for today's support staff, it is an increasingly common mantra. Before you know it, leaving at your contracted time of 5pm is little more than wishful thinking. </p> <p>\"The average UK employee works seven hours a week for nothing,\" claims a new survey by the TUC, which adds that we now work the longest hours in Europe. \"Four million staff regularly contribute more than five hours a week unpaid, and half regularly work on their days off.\" Little wonder the report found that workers are cheated out of \u00a323bn in unpaid overtime every year. Another recent survey, published by Abbey National, has discovered that, irrespective of whether overtime is rewarded in paypackets, almost one in four UK employees puts in extra time and half regularly take work home. </p> <p>So when's the revolution, or at the very least, the odd protest? Surprisingly, you'll rarely find employees objecting, according to the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD). Its study, Living At Work, reveals that one in eight people who work long hours say they do so because they genuinely enjoy their jobs. </p> <p>Indeed, work has rarely been so fashionable. Dramas such as Ally McBeal are glittering advertisements for office life, featuring characters who hardly ever seem to go home. Personnel Today magazine agrees that some people thrive on working long hours - at least for part of their lives: \"Soho twentysomething media whizz-kids, for instance, favour a seamless blend of work and life.\" </p> <p>Others do it for the extra money or to enhance career prospects, claims the Institute for Employment Studies (IES). Nevertheless, the IES found that more often, negative work pressures are to blame for the \"let's work late\" culture. Greater competition, fewer staff and tighter budgets are contributing factors, along with increasingly demanding clients - which has come about largely as a result of today's 24-hour society. </p> <p>\"There are 1m people at work at any time between 9pm and 1am in the UK, and this figure is likely to double in the next 10 years,\" predicts sociologist Michael Willmott of the Future Foundation. \"That's down to the internet, with activities such as divorce-filing and house-buying now possible at any time of the day or night. In addition, open-all-hours supermarkets, all-night bars and late-night gyms - and the increasingly global economy - are accountable.\" </p> <p>Heavy and unwelcome workloads are cited by the IES as the chief reason for the millennial rise in overtime. For PAs, the story is particularly bleak. If your manager works into the night, the chances are that you will too. And, according to research by the CIPD, managers overwhelmingly constitute the group working the longest hours of all. \"Other kinds of secretaries also suffer,\" says a spokesperson. \"The more work the boss takes on, the more administration there is. Overtime has an incredibly fast spiralling effect and support roles are the worst hit. If they don't complain, it tends not to be because they enjoy having no life. Rather, it's usually due to fear.\" </p> <p>This fear, not surprisingly, is exacerbated in organisations where long hours are interpreted as demonstrating commitment. Angela Howard, a researcher in working hours, claims this increasingly common myth is a legacy of the mid-90s, \"when there was a culture of job insecurity that drove many people to work harder and longer. These levels became the norm and that's why overtime - especially unpaid - doesn't get the objection it should.\" </p> <p>Whether you're in a slave-driven organisation or you actually want to work all the hours God sends, the impact is serious. Consider a survey of Toyota in Japan where 124,000 of the 200,000 employees were found to be suffering from chronic fatigue - which was affecting their precision - due to excessive working hours. </p> <p>What's more, the Industrial Society recently found that workaholism has become the biggest threat to marriages and long-term relationships. So stressed-out have some late-night workers become that they are suing employers. Lucy Daniels, associate of the Work Life Research Centre, claims this threat partly accounts for the efforts of some major employers finally to start attacking presenteeism. \"To be fair, the main reason is that they're realising the severity of repercussions. But some are also, quite simply, scared of lawsuits.\" </p> <p>For companies such as PricewaterhouseCoopers - which now examines employees' timesheets to identify people who spend too long at work - the implementation of the Working Time Directive and the government's recent emphasis on work-life balance have been significant. And, says Ian Brown, HR manager at GlaxoWellcome, where managers are now expected to tell staff who continually stay late to go home, generation X-ers should also be thanked for changes. \"These people - the young high-flyers who can afford to have greater demands of employers in today's tighter employment market - are actually turning down job offers in companies that lack progressive working-hours policies.\" </p> <p>A company at the forefront of decreasing overtime is BT. A complete overhaul of working practices has been outlined in its recent document that reveals staff will be warned that working too many hours has a \"damaging effect\" on them, their families, and their communities. Joanna Foster, chair of the National Work-Life Forum, is optimistic that \"the next few years will see a surge in organisations adopting similarly specific polices on lower working hours.\" </p> <p>But there is such a thing as taking the drive too far. British companies would be advised to ignore the example of American oil tycoon, Armand Hammer, who became notorious for firing employees for incompetence if they were found in the office after hours. </p> <p><strong>Clockwatching</strong><br>We asked two PAs to calculate how many hours they work</p> <p><strong> Sally Gordon, 30, works as PA to the MD of Pink Elephant UK, a Reading-based IT service management company. She is a strict 9-5er.</strong> </p> <p>\"Unless there's a really good reason, I refuse to work longer than my contracted hours. In my last job, I had hardly any life and I didn't want a repeat of that. I asked careful questions at interview as well as asking around in the office. When I realised that most people do go home on time - and that a bit of assertiveness goes a long way if ever there is an issue about it - I decided that I would take the job. </p> <p>\"I think it helps that there's a bar on the premises. It gives me and my colleagues an extra incentive to say, 'Right, we're off'. In fact, on a Friday afternoon, everyone clears the office simultaneously to go for drinks. Some days, the boss comes round and says, 'OK guys, finish off. We're all going home now.' </p> <p>\"I resented my previous employer hugely because of the expectation to work unpaid overtime. I wound up hating my job. Here, on the other hand, I feel that I work for a company that respects my right to a life, and that, in turn, makes me respect them.\" </p> <p> <strong>Rachel Smith (not her real name), 25, works as a PA for an advertising company in the West End. She begins her day no later than 7.30am and rarely leaves the office before 7pm.</strong> </p> <p>\"Most days, I could reasonably finish all my work within an eight-hour day. But I get resentful looks from colleagues if I look ready to leave at 5pm. If ever I do that - which is very seldom - I loudly announce that I'm taking work home and pack files and paperwork. It's assumed that I'll give up my evening to work, whereas I won't even open my case. </p> <p>\"Sometimes I do enjoy staying late. Since I'm single and not on a huge wage, I can't afford to go out every night. So it's a case of sitting in front of the TV with an M&amp;S dinner, or having a laugh with people in the office. </p> <p>\"But most of the time, the reason for staying on is because of peer pressure and the clear message that the organisation gives out about long hours being the best way to prove you take pride in your work. </p> <p>\"Some weekends, I sleep until at least lunchtime because I'm so tired from my working week. That is making me think about moving on. But I'm worried it will be just the same in other offices.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong> 1 Wonder Boys </strong></p> <p><strong> The stars: </strong> Michael Douglas, Tobey Maguire, Frances McDormand, Robert Downey Jr </p> <p><strong> The pitch: </strong> Michael Douglas acts his age </p> <p><strong> What it is: </strong> Adapted from Michael Chabon's novel, it's a freewhelling film about a crumbling novelist/lecturer (Douglas), his lover (McDormand), his star student (Maguire) and his very camp agent (Downey). The action takes place over the course of a wild weekend after his exasperated wife leaves him, and Douglas embarks on a substance-fuelled journey of discovery aided and abetted by Maguire, his oddball star writing pupil. Douglas is no stranger to playing morally compromised characters (Fatal Attraction, Wall Street), and is alternately charming and childish in the lead. It is director Curtis Hanson's first film since LA Confidential and is something of a labour of love for the journeyman-turned-A list auteur. </p> <p><strong> The prospects: </strong> This low-key film isn't exactly what everyone was expecting after the scale and complexity of LA Confidential , but it has a wonderful cast and witty script. About to get a re-release in the States for the awards season, Maguire cements his reputation as a shining young talent and could be in line for the Oscar nod he deserved last year for Ride With the Devil. (Opens in November) </p> <p> <strong> 2 In The Mood For Love </strong></p> <p><strong> The stars: </strong> Maggie Cheung, Tony Leung </p> <p><strong> The pitch: </strong> Brief Encounter in Hong Kong </p> <p><strong> What it is: </strong> Beautifully shot Sixties-set love story directed by Wong Kar Wei, about neighbours who suspect that their respective spouses are having an affair, and the restrained relationship that emerges. An atmospheric story that will delight and beguile the director's fans. </p> <p><strong> The prospects: </strong> Many critics thought that this, not Dancer In The Dark , was the best film at Cannes. Will only enhance Wong Kar Wei's hefty reputation. (Opens in October) </p> <p> <strong> 3 Memento </strong></p> <p><strong> The stars: </strong> Guy Pearce, Carrie Anne Moss </p> <p><strong> The pitch: </strong> Oliver Sacks meets Kubrick </p> <p><strong> What it is: </strong> In what is surely the most stylistically daring film of the season a man (Pearce) suffering from continual memory loss tries to reconstruct the events surrounding his wife's death. What's more, the story is told backwards. </p> <p><strong> The prospects: </strong> The few people who saw director Christopher Nolan's debut, Following, raved about it. The star power here, added to Nolan's talent, should get him a decent audience. (Opens in October) </p> <p> <strong> 4 Billy Elliot </strong></p> <p><strong> The stars: </strong> Jamie Bell, Julie Walters </p> <p><strong> The pitch: </strong> Ken Loach does West Side Story </p> <p><strong> What it is: </strong> Theatre wunderkind Stephen Daldry follows Sam Mendes's footsteps with a high-profile debut film. In this case, the story of a boy (Bell) in a pit village during the miners' strike who nurtures the unlikely dream of being a ballet dancer. </p> <p><strong> The prospects: </strong> The set-up sounds like a comedy sketch, but the film went down a storm at Cannes and Edinburgh. Possibly the best British film of the year. (Opens next week) </p> <p> <strong> 5 The Way Of The Gun </strong></p> <p><strong> The stars: </strong> Benecio Del Toro, Ryan Phillipe, James Caan, Juliette Lewis </p> <p><strong> The pitch: </strong> Peckinpah with twists </p> <p><strong> What it is: </strong> A thriller every bit as complicated as you would expect of the directorial debut from the writer of The Usual Suspects to be. Del Toro and Phillipe are the bad guys who kidnap pregnant surrogate mother Juliette Lewis, not realising who she's connected to. And that's very much only the start </p> <p><strong> The prospects: </strong> There hasn't been a big American crime movie for a while, and it could be this one. (Opens in November) </p> <p> <strong> 6 Girlfight </strong></p> <p><strong> The stars: </strong> Michelle Rodriguez, Jaime Tirelli, Santiago Douglas, Paul Calderon </p> <p><strong> The pitch: </strong> The feminist Rocky </p> <p><strong> What it is: </strong> Bracingly realist tale of a teenager from the South Bronx (Rodriguez) who decides she wants to box, despite the opposition of her abusive father (Calderon) and the boxing authorities. Made by first time director Karyn Kusama and with a first-time actress as the star. </p> <p><strong> The prospects: </strong> The indie movie of the autumn: Rodriguez is truly sensational. (Opens in November) </p> <p> <strong> 7 Road Trip </strong></p> <p><strong> The stars: </strong> Breckin Meyer, Tom Green, Amy Smart </p> <p><strong> The pitch: </strong> The Sure Thing collides with Animal House </p> <p><strong> What it is: </strong> Cheerfully dumb (but not stupid) comedy about a college kid (Meyer) and his mates chasing across the US in search of a misplaced video of him having sex with the wrong girl. Drugs, frat houses, sex-obsessed pensioners and snakes are involved </p> <p><strong> The prospects: </strong> Good. It is by far the best of the recent run of grossout comedies. (Opens in October) </p> <p> <strong> 8 The Yards </strong></p> <p><strong> The stars: </strong> Mark Wahlberg, Joaquin Phoenix, Charlize Theron, James Caan </p> <p><strong> The pitch: </strong> Mean Streets revisited </p> <p><strong> What it is: </strong> Grimy story of crime, corruption and (of course) loyalty in New York City, with Wahlberg as the guy just back from serving time for the crime he didn't commit, and swiftly getting involved in more dubious situations. </p> <p><strong> The prospects: </strong> It had a great buzz at Cannes, but that only means so much. Wahlberg and Phoenix were both in huge summer hits, and New York crime stories never go out of style. (Opens in November) </p> <p> <strong> 9 Black And White </strong></p> <p><strong> The stars: </strong> Power, Robert Downey Jr, Mike Tyson, Ben Stiller, Bijou Phillips </p> <p><strong> The pitch: </strong> A socio-anthropology essay in which Claudia Schiffer takes her clothes off </p> <p><strong> What it is: </strong> Friend-of-the-stars James Toback enticed Tyson, Schiffer, Brooke Shields and the Wu-Tang Clan to appear in this sprawling satire about race relations, threesomes, the music business and sports in contemporary Manhattan </p> <p><strong> The prospects: </strong> Add hip hop and boxing fans to the plain curious and you should have an audience for Toback's fascinating but uneven film. (Opens in November) </p> <p> <strong> 10 House Of Mirth </strong></p> <p><strong> The stars: </strong> Gillian Anderson, Eric Stoltz, Dan Ackroyd </p> <p><strong> The pitch: </strong> Gillian Anderson does costume drama </p> <p><strong> What it is: </strong> Typical Edith Wharton tale of a woman (Anderson) overstepping the bounds of polite society. Notable for the unusual casting (Dan Ackroyd) and the distinctive British director Terence Davies. </p> <p><strong> The prospects: </strong> An intriguing mix of elements makes for a very interesting proposition. Now if Anderson's fanbase can be persuaded to see it, we might have the weirdest hit of the year. (Opens in October)</p> <p><strong>Star of the season: Robert Downey Jnr</strong></p> <p>Or the artist formerly known as prisoner P50552 at<br>the California State Penitentiary. Early last month,<br>Downey Jnr was released after serving 12 months<br>of a three-year sentence for jumping probation on<br>drugs charges. His early release, it seemed, had a<br>good deal to do with a Vanity Fair profile which<br>detailed his life behind bars alongside the likes of<br>'Sugar Bear' and 'Big Al', not to mention the<br>attentions of a 'pre-op transexual'. </p> <p>For more than a couple of decades, the<br>35-year-old Downey Jnr's life has resembled a<br>cheap melodrama. Son of a hippy, he smoked his<br>first joint at eight, and graduated into a teenage<br>of genuine excess while his peers were still<br>boasting of the odd drunken binge.</p> <p>By the time he reached his thirties, the mishaps<br>turned increasingly comic, most vividly when<br>after one night on the town, he found himself in<br>the wrong house, and collapsed into the bed of<br>his neighbour's eleven-year-old son.</p> <p>Amid the endless shenanigans, one thing never in<br>doubt was his talent. On Downey Jnr's release<br>from prison, Robert Altman, who directed him in<br>Short Cuts, said, 'If I had another role for him right<br>now, I wouldn't give it a second thought to call<br>him.'</p> <p>Downey Jnr hit fame while in his teens, when he<br>secured a slot on Saturday Night Live.

  "<p>Evreyone has favourite Wembley memories. Especially the great goals - and the television age has preserved the bulk of post-war efforts on film or videotape. Few can match Ricky Villa's 1981 FA Cup winning effort for Tottenham against Manchester City in terms of sheer skill and audacity. But none can match <strong>Geoff Hurst's</strong> 1966 World Cup final hat-trick for drama and controversy. </p> <p>His second goal, England's third, will be talked about forever. Into extra time at 2-2, Alan Ball crosses from the right, Hurst swivels and shoots - in off the crossbar. But was it over the line? 'I believe very strongly it was in,' said Hurst - now Sir Geoffrey and ready to welcome the Germans back for the stadium's 7 October finale in the 2002 World Cup qualifiers. </p> <p>'Roger Hunt wheeled away shouting \"Goal!\" when his striker's instinct would have been to make sure if he thought it hadn't gone in. That's good enough for me. For the umpteenth, thousandth time, it was over the line. If you don't believe me just look in the record books.' </p> <p>Then there was the sheer power and drama of his third, putting the issue beyond all doubt. The net bulged before the German keeper Hans Tilkowski moved a muscle. </p> <p>'We'd played two hours at Wembley in difficult conditions on a heavy pitch in a very hard game,' Hurst said. 'When the ball came to me in the final seconds, I was just going to hit it as hard as I could. If it went behind the goal 50 or 60 yards it would have taken a vital few seconds for it to be retrieved and the game would probably have been over. After it went in, I hardly remember what happened next. Someone said, 'well done,' but that's it.' </p> <p>Hurst and Villa were scorers of great goals, but there were also outstanding feats at the other end. <strong>Bert Trautmann's</strong> bravery in completing the 1956 FA Cup Final for victorious Manchester City against Birmingham with a broken neck is the stuff of legend but it can't compete with the split-second, gravity-defying brilliance of <strong>Jim Montgomery's</strong> fabulous double-save that helped to inspire Sunderland to their 1973 triumph over mighty Leeds. </p> <p>Sunderland, stoically defending the lead given them by Ian Porterfield's 31st-minute goal, were unhinged by Paul Reaney's deep cross from the right. Trevor Cherry popped up unmarked at the far post to power a diving header to Montgomery's left. He dived low and parried but the ball ran straight to Peter Lorimer with the goalkeeper sprawled on the turf. Lorimer shot firmly at the unguarded net only for 'Monty' to spring from the turf, hauling himself left to fist the ball against the crossbar and to safety. </p> <p>'Immediately after the game I thought I maybe should have held the first one,' says Montgomery - now Darlington's assistant manager - in a moment of brutal self-criticism. 'But when I looked at the tape and looked at the context of the save, I wasn't too hard on myself. I'm grateful that I produced a save like that when it mattered. So many players and teams freeze on the big occasion. I didn't - we didn't - and we did enough to win what was a great game.' </p> <p>It was Montgomery's only big game at the great ground although many good judges believe he should have played for England there. What made Wembley special for him? </p> <p>'It's the crowd that makes Wembley different from the Old Traffords and Anfields,' he said. 'As you come up out of the tunnel the noise is phenomenal, like a blanket. Then when you get out on the pitch, you're so remote from the fans, you can't hear them. It's amazing. </p> <p>'From a fan's point of view, the facilities are abysmal. But Wembley was special and I'll miss those towers. Apart from my save, the thing that sticks in my mind most about Cup Final day was driving up Wembley Way through a sea of red and white and seeing those fantastic towers. It's shameful that they have not been incorporated into the new ground.' </p> <p>Another save is remembered more for the failure of the striker than the importance of the block. Ten year's after Montgomery's heroics, <strong>Gordon Smith</strong> had the chance to win the Cup for Brighton against Manchester United. Again the TV commentary has eased the moment into folklore. 'And Smith must score' said John Motson as the ball went from Michael Robinson to striker Smith's feet 12 yards out in the last moments of normal time. </p> <p>Smith, now a Fifa-accredited agent in Scotland, recalls: 'I just remember Michael bursting through, and I moved up to support him. He rolled the ball to me and I took one touch before hitting a low shot. I am certainly not blaming Michael, but if he had knocked the ball to me with a bit more pace I would probably have struck it first time. As it was I took the touch, then sent United goalkeeper Gary Bailey the wrong way, only to see the ball stick between his legs and stay there. I moved in hoping to seize on any rebound, but the ball just didn't come back out to me. </p> <p>'Yes, I believe \"Smith should have scored\" but it was nevertheless a tremendous save by Gary, and I know he was always a bit annoyed that he didn't receive the credit he felt he deserved.' </p> <p>The final ended 2-2 after extra time, with United winning the replay 4-0. </p> <p>England suffered some of their darkest moments at Wembley. Hungary, inspired by <strong>Ferenc Puskas</strong>, humbled England 6-3 in 1953, becoming the first non-British national team to win at the national stadium. Another memorable failure for England came 20 years later, when they were held to a 1-1 draw by Poland and failed to qualify for the 1974 World Cup finals. The match - and the Polish goal - was a nightmare for the Leeds defender <strong>Norman Hunter</strong>. </p> <p>For Hunter, 17 October, 1973 was a golden opportunity. England manager Sir Alf Ramsey had 'rested' his skipper, Bobby Moore, after an unconvincing defensive display in defeat against Poland in Chorzow. Hunter was in for the return - playing in his favoured centre-back role in a truly big international match for the first time. </p> <p>Everyone now knows that Poland's goalkeeper Jan Tomaszewski was inspired - and Jan Domarski got the goal that put England out of the competition. What some may forget - but not Hunter, never Hunter - was that he 'screwed it' in the break that led to the goal. England's failure to qualify led directly to Ramsey's sacking and meant the end of Hunter's hopes of making the World Cup finals as a first-choice England pick. </p> <p>'Poland's goal was my fault,' he says. Only when he recounts the painful detail does he hesitate. 'It was me against Grezegorz Lato and what I was going to do... I'd set myself to tackle with my left foot. I was going to take him and the ball out. Instead I changed my mind and thought I'd keep it in - thought I'd lift the ball with my right foot...' </p> <p>In that moment, Hunter was lost. Lato pounced and streaked away down England's right flank. Still, when the ball was played for Lato, a goal was far from certain. 'Yes, Peter Shilton should have thrown his cap on it,' says Hunter ruefully. 'Lato's shot wasn't brilliant but it went under him. He should have really saved it, but... it was my fault. I've never played in a more one-sided game and lost. </p> <p>'But I've good memories too. I recall playing in an England Probables v Possibles training game as a 22-year-old before the '66 finals. For a young player, that was quite something. I loved it. You can keep the Nou Camp and Bernabeu and all that - Wembley was the place. I'll miss it.' </p> <p>The following year, 1974, Hunter watched as a sell-out crowd was astonished by the double sending-off of his team-mate Billy Bremner and Liverpool's Kevin Keegan in the first Charity Shield game to be played at Wembley. The pair came to blows after Keegan was hit by a bad tackle near Leeds' penalty box. After referee Bob Mathewson sent them off, they petulantly tore off their shirts as they ran towards the tunnel. Hunter recalls with a chuckle: 'It was out of character for them both but Kevin got the wrong man when he turned on Billy - he was tackled by Johnny Giles!' </p> <p>From an earlier era, <strong>Tony Pawson</strong> - an Observer contributor for 50 years and a great amateur sportsman in the Corinthian tradition - recalls the glory of Wembley FA Amateur Cup wins with Pegasus. </p> <p>'Some 50 years ago my ambitions were playing before full houses at Lord's and Wembley. Despite its shorter history, Wembley was the more atmospheric venue. To drive up Wembley Way was more inspirational than walking through the Grace Gates. </p> <p>'The joy of twice mounting the steps to receive the Amateur Cup remains a dream fully realised. There will be no more Wembley dreams, only memories. Happily for me the dreams remain joyous memories.' </p> <p>Not that it's all football...</p> <p><strong>RUGBY LEAGUE</strong> </p> <p> In all the 73 Rugby League matches to have played at Wembley since 1929 - nine internationals and 64 Challenge Cup finals - the most enduring memory is of a missed goal kick. </p> <p>It came in 1968, in a sodden final between Wakefield Trinity and Leeds. Ken Hirst, the Wakefield wing, had splashed through the puddles to score a last-minute try which cut his team's deficit to 11-10, leaving <strong>Don Fox</strong>, Trinity's loose forward who had already won the Lance Todd Trophy as man of the match, with the apparent formality of converting from under the posts. </p> <p>But Fox toe-poked the ball wide, and immediately slumped to his knees in despair, immersing his head in a puddle. 'He's a poor lad,' said the BBC commentator Eddie Waring. Fox never played again, subsequently retiring from his job as a joiner for the National Coal Board at Sharlston because of ill health. He has never spoken about the incident which ended his career but Peter, his older brother and the former Bradford, Featherstone and Great Britain coach, is keen to set the record straight. </p> <p>'First of all, it was only the foresight of our Don in taking a short kick-off to Hirst which set up the try,' says Fox. 'And although everyone else thought Wakefield had won the cup, I was worried because I could see our Don trying to wipe the ball on his jersey. But there wasn't a dry spot in the house. If I could, I'd have gone on that field and let him wipe the ball on my shirt. </p> <p>'He was devastated. Not for missing the goal - as he said, everybody misses the odd kick from under the posts. But not everybody has lost a gold medal for their team-mates. That's a measure of our Don. Only a great man would think of their mates in that predicament.' </p> <p>Don Fox still lives in Featherstone - no doubt with, at best, mixed emotions and memories of Wembley. </p> <p><strong>RUGBY UNION</strong> </p> <p> Union's links with Wembley are far more limited than League's - yet one of the British game's most momentous matches took place beneath the twin towers. For a change, the 'home' side were Wales and the vanquished visitors England. </p> <p>It was 11 April, 1999 when Wales ended their popular, but temporary, tenancy at Wembley during the construction of The Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. On a sunny Sunday afternoon, Grand-Slam-chasing England took on Wales in the last Five Nations match of the season and - with Italy due to join the competition in 2000 - the last in its history. </p> <p>Despite racing to an early try-scoring lead, England could not escape the range of Neil Jenkins's boot and were only six points ahead as the game went into injury time. Wales won a line-out on the English 22 and Rob Howley fed Scott Quinnell on a set move. Quinnell juggled the ball, which threw the English defence, and sent <strong>Scott Gibbs</strong> on a dancing rampage through the resultant gap, past four defenders and over the try-line. Jenkins's conversion gave Wales the most famous of victories. </p> <p>'I also played there in the 1996 Rugby League Challenge Cup,' says Gibbs, 'which was an incredible experience. It's the most famous football ground in the world. But to beat England there in the last minute, with us as the underdogs against the Grand Slam contenders: I wish it could always be like that. Before the game, the English management were asking which way up the steps the England team should go after the game. The ribbons were on the Five Nations trophy.' </p> <p>Howley, Wales's captain for the day, remembers it with equal fondness: 'It's just unbelievable to think that all those players have changed in the same changing rooms... and when we walked out, the atmosphere was electric.' </p> <p> <strong> THE OLYMPICS</strong> </p> <p>The Games came to Wembley in 1948 when London was the host city. When Dutch sprinter <strong> Fanny Blankers-Koen</strong> arrived her first impression was: 'Well it looked all right. We didn't think too much of it, really. I never expected to achieve anything big there.' </p> <p>The 30-year-old mother of two was not alone in considering herself an outsider. 'The British team manager Jack Crump had written me off in a magazine article, said I was too old,' says Blankers-Koen, now 82. 'It didn't bother me. I thought that he might be right!' she laughs. But he could not have been more wrong. </p> <p>She won the 100m by a distance and followed up in the 80m hurdles, the 200m and the 4x100m relay- still the only female athlete to have won four gold medals at one Games. She recently travelled to Monte Carlo to receive the Female Athlete of the Century award. 'I'd never expected them to choose an old git like me', she says. </p> <p><strong>BOXING</strong> </p> <p> The final round of the fight at Wembley Stadium in September 1995 was one of the most memorable in modern boxing history. In the ring in the middle of the turf were <strong>Frank Bruno</strong> and the American, Oliver McCall, and with one round left Bruno was three minutes away from winning the world heavyweight title. He was exhausted, though, and the crowd of 30,000 was standing, willing the British man to victory. </p> <p>Bruno had been at Wembley before - in 1986 - when he failed to take the world title from Tim Witherspoon. There had been no boxing on the pitch at Wembley for 23 years before then. The previous fight was the 1963 non-title meeting between Henry Cooper and the then Cassius Clay in which Cooper connected with a left hook that dropped Clay. Sadly, Our 'Enery was cut and the fight was stopped, yet Cooper's solitary success has remained a talking point. </p> <p>But the mood of the fans in the stadium when Bruno was raised from his stool at the start of round 12 and sent to successfully survive the final three minutes is the ultimate Wembley boxing moment. For everybody knew that Bruno was just one punch from defeat. </p> <p><strong>SPEEDWAY</strong> </p> <p> Wembley became a big stage for speedway - much to the irritation of Walter Winterbottom, England's first football manager. He said 'that motorbike stuff' damaged the flanks of the pitch. But it is fondly recalled by one great champion,<strong>Ole Olsen</strong>. He won two world titles at Wembley - in 1975 and again three years later - when he triumphed before 93,000 fans at the Golden Jubilee world championship. </p> <p>'I loved Wembley,' says Olsen who heads the Speedway Grand Prix Association in his native Copenhagen. 'It was extremely narrow coming out of the corners so you had to hit the right spot. What I remember best is coming out of that tunnel - a tremendous feeling when there were a lot of people there. And there usually were.' </p> <p>But it was different when, aged 24, Olsen made his first visit to Wembley for the 1971 European Championship. </p> <p>'My bike broke and I ended up on the ground. I was very upset and some bastard came to me and said it didn't matter because it was more important to win at the World Championships. I did win at the Worlds - but I just wanted to win at Wembley.' </p> <p><strong>GREYHOUNDS</strong> </p> <p> Many of the outstanding dogs in the history of greyhound racing were trained and raced at Wembley but undoubtedly the sport's greatest moment at the stadium was the legendary <strong>Mick The Miller's</strong> triumph in the 1931 St Leger. </p> <p>Mick the Miller, winner of the Greyhound Derby over 525 yards at the White City in both 1929 and 1930 was prevented from claiming an amazing hat-trick in that classic the following year when he was first past post in the final, only for the race to be declared void. He could finish only fourth in the re-run. By 1931 he was five years old and clearly past his best and it was thought he would be retired when beaten in several subsequent races. </p> <p>But it was decided to give him one last classic outing in the Leger over 700 yards, a longer distance than he had ever attempted. Mick the Miller ran unbeaten throughout the event, winning by a length in the final to the thunderous cheers of a packed stadium - big race events often attracted close to 100,000 - and it was the great dog's last race. </p> <p><strong>THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE ON THE PITCH...</strong></p> <p> Seconds before Hurst shot his third goal in 1966, the BBC commentator Ken Wolstenholme memorably observed: 'Some people are on the pitch... they think it's all over...' </p> <p>One of those pitch invaders was<strong>Michael Richardson</strong>, a Londoner who was 17 at the time and a drummer with a rock group. 'I had a seat near the front opposite the Royal Box and I clambered on to the pitch. It was sheer elation. I wasn't a hooligan or anything. I didn't get very far, no farther than the touchline before I was dragged off by six policemen. I wasn't thrown out - they just dropped me back in the crowd. There was a real carnival atmosphere.' That night he played at Tiffany's in central London. 'Everybody was buzzing. Great days.' </p> <p>Richardson, still drumming, for singer Elkie Brooks, is not impressed with what they're doing to the old stadium. 'Nostalgia isn't what it used to be,' he says gloomily. And if he thinks it's all over for the stage where he briefly achieved fame... it is now. </p> <p><em>Reports by Bill Bradshaw, Peter White, Andy Wilson, Michael Aylwin, Marie-Jose Kleef, Oliver Owen, Ruud Hunt, Steve Bunce, Jon Henderson </em></p>",
  "<p>With football's transfer policy on death row and the game's power brokers and legal experts racking their brains for ways to save the status quo, a straight-talking Belfast boy could make a powerful case for the defence. </p> <p>Neil Lennon's long, winding route to the top of British football was full of stepping stones and helping hands. Without them he might never have made the leap from teenage rejection, through washing and ironing his own kit, driving around in an old red Cortina with black doors and playing in a stadium with nettles growing on the terraces, to a reported salary of \u00a330,000 per week, Wembley finals and European football. </p> <p>He'll tell you all about those vital apprenticeship years at Manchester City, where habits were formed and skills honed. He'll praise the system for giving him a second chance, a new door opening for him at Crewe Alexandra when City pointed him to the exit and left him bawling his eyes out. He'll regale you with affectionate stories of life at the Alex, where manager Dario Gradi helped him progress enough to attract attention from the higher divisions. </p> <p>Crewe needed Lennon just as Lennon needed Crewe (the club's existence depends on nurturing and selling talent) and if a reason were needed for preserving the transfer market, this symbiotic relationship is it. </p> <p>Lennon has a similar bond with his current club, Leicester City. In the summer Celtic and Aston Villa tried to prise him away, but he chose to stay at a place which makes him bubble with happiness. 'When I came here I wanted to do what I did at Crewe, to be the top dog, to be Leicester's Roy Keane, and I think I've done that. I've got my niche here. When people mention Leicester they automatically think of Matt Elliott, Muzzy Izzet, Neil Lennon. We've earned that over the years.' </p> <p>That status, coupled with the genuine enjoyment he gleans from being in a squad with so many firm friends, means a great deal. 'At certain clubs,' he explains, 'you go in, don't talk to anybody, train, go home. I wouldn't want to be a footballer in that environment. You could see it at Chelsea. A lot of their players were playing for themselves, not for each other. That's one thing we've never done here.' </p> <p>Putting one over the bigshots from the Bridge last weekend, and simultaneously joining Manchester United at the Premiership summit, was an 'awesome' moment for Lennon's Leicester. 'I think they look upon playing clubs like us as a chore rather than a challenge. Clubs like that look down on us.' It rankles that credit for City's victory was overlooked compared to the spotlight on turbulence at Chelsea. It was all about how Claudio Ranieri would fare in place of Gianluca Vialli. The fact that Peter Taylor is constructing a brave new world after taking over from his idolised predecessor Martin O'Neill passed virtually unnoticed. </p> <p>Taylor's enthusiasm made an immediate impact on his new charges. It can't have been easy to come into a club with three influential figures - all proteges of O'Neill - pondering their futures. Persuading Lennon, Izzet and Elliott to sign improved contracts at the club made a profound and crucial statement. 'Three or four years ago we'd have all gone,' admits the 29-year-old midfielder. 'The message is: \"We're here. We're not a selling club\".' </p> <p>Not that it was an easy decision, in fact, it gave Lennon anguished, sleepless nights. His heart was torn between his pals in the squad and a magnet drawing him towards Celtic, the club of his boyhood dreams and his charismatic mentor O'Neill (He still calls O'Neill gaffer and suspects he always will, echoing O'Neill's reverence to his own guru Brian Clough). Wages were not a factor for Lennon - indeed he felt anxious that people would expect a 30-yard volley every five minutes as recompense for a rise - but Taylor's persuasive line struck a chord. 'He was really honest with me. He said: \"Look Lennie, I'm not prepared to let you go.\" He told me it would be a backward step going to Scotland and that the Premiership was the place to be. He outlined his plans for the squad and asked me to give him a chance. </p> <p>'Peter has done tremendously well. That was a bloody hard act to follow. He's definitely his own man, which is what we needed -- a strong character. He has a really good sense of humour, which I find refreshing as well. Martin was hilarious at times but could also be aloof and unpredictable, which kept you on your toes, whereas Peter is very hands-on at the training ground and likes to be one of the lads. He cares passionately about his players, always on the phone if someone is injured or down. That's new too. You could always go to talk to Martin but he'd rarely come to you.' Lennon is careful to add that this is not a criticism, merely an explanation of differing styles. 'How could you knock Martin after all he did here?' </p> <p>If early portents are to be believed, it won't be easy to knock Peter either. Results (four wins, two draws, no defeats, and a virtually unbreachable defence) speak for themselves. What's more, he has revived a clutch of players, and Lennon reckons a fresh start has breathed new life into Andy Impey, Darren Eadie and Stan Collymore. Taylor has also recruited quality newcomers, which impresses the old guard and puts Lennon in bullish mood. </p> <p>'If people think there's something wrong with the British game they should look at us - it's not all doom and gloom. There are a lot of British players about who can cope with the best around. I looked at Chelsea's team last Sunday and to be fair they have millions worth of talent, all quality players, but I know who I'd rather play for. I'd rather play for our boys because I know what they are going to give me. </p> <p>'If you are getting the cream, the Vieiras, Henrys, Stams, Desaillys, that's great, but there are a lot of foreign players coming into the game who aren't as good as people perceive them to be originally. It's stunting the growth of talent in England and hopefully they will bring in a cull. It's a hell of a lot harder for a 19-year-old to get in the game now than when I was 19. The game is going away. You go to Old Trafford and it's not a football stadium, it's a city. I don't recognise the place at all.' </p> <p>He laments the fact he can barely recognise the game he grew up in. The thought of Sturm Graz in the Champions League makes him groan. Having said that, should Leicester keep up their early pace, continuing today against Everton, they might even qualify themselves. The idea provokes an interesting reaction which is Leicester all over: half a flicker of fantasy, half self-mockery. </p> <p>'The chairman mentioned it the other day and the lads went \"Eh?!\" We're happy to get 40 points first and talk about the Champions League after that. We're top of the league after six games and we're not getting blas\u00e9. Two defeats and you're back around 10th, which is where all the lads reckon we'll end up anyway. Football has a habit of kicking you in the balls.' </p> <p>That's when you need the Crewes and Gradis, the O'Neills, Taylors and Lennons to help you back on your feet.</p>",
  "<p>David O'Leary, that nice, naive young Leeds United manager, wanted to take Elland Road's first Champions League match in his stride but couldn't quite manage it. </p> <p>You could tell by the way O'Leary ran across the saturated pitch to acknowledge the fans after the 1-0 defeat of AC Milan that he was unusually pumped up. He still hadn't calmed down when he did his television interviews, and in the press room afterwards the normally mild-mannered manager bristled with indignance and rounded on individual reporters as if he had just come back from a seminar on sarcasm conducted by Sir Alex Ferguson. </p> <p>What was bothering O'Leary was not the disgruntled supporter who told 5 Live that the reason Leeds had lost at home to Ipswich Town was that their manager was saving himself for the Arsenal job, amusing though that was. O'Leary was upset because one of the local papers had had the temerity to use the word 'crisis' in conjunction with the club's slump in form. Thanks to a comical error two minutes from time by Milan's Brazilian goalkeeper, O'Leary was able to rubbish his critics. But his eagerness to do so confirmed that a nerve had been touched. </p> <p>Crisis, like disaster, is perhaps a silly word to use of mere footballing matters. Anyway, if you are playing in the Champions League any crisis can only be relative. Leeds are already the envy of all of the little clubs and some of the big ones after playing their way into the European elite without spending sackfuls of money. And can any club really be in crisis if they can beat AC Milan and sit, however unexpectedly, level on points with Barcelona in one of the toughest of Champions League groups? </p> <p>O'Leary thinks not, and certainly the way Leeds played on Tuesday belied any suggestion of flagging morale. A 0-0 draw might have been the result Milan were looking for, but even allowing for the fact that the Italian season has not yet started and Serie A superstars are rarely seen at their best on wet nights in West Yorkshire, Leeds would have been full value for the point they looked to have earned until Dida's blunder brought the bonus of all three. </p> <p>It would have been interesting to see O'Leary's reaction had the match remained scoreless. No blame could have attached to a Leeds side missing half a dozen regulars and featuring several players out of position had they drawn, and O'Leary would have been just as entitled to claim a moral victory and salute the spirit of his players. Yet because of Barcelona's defeat in Istanbul, such an outcome at Elland Road would have put Milan on top of Group H and Leeds bottom. That really would have been bad news, since for all O'Leary's enjoyable invective last season about the principle of Champions League losers dropping into the Uefa Cup halfway through - 'As far as I am concerned it is an absolute joke' - there can be little doubt that realistically Leeds have their sights on third position and a continued run in Europe. </p> <p>Maybe it was not always so, but there are only so many knocks a team can take, and when you have lost your best player until after Christmas, your captain to a neck injury and suffered two successive home defeats by newly pro moted teams either side of a 4-0 mauling in Barcelona, you can be forgiven for warming to the Uefa Cup. That's not even mentioning the extra baggage Leeds are carrying - the unwelcome return to Turkey next month or the assault charges some players will soon be answering in court. Performing against the odds often seems to bring out the best in Leeds, but even after what O'Leary conceded was a flukey winner against Milan there are few grounds for supposing his team can finish in the top two. </p> <p>Most Leeds supporters took the view before the Milan game that third place and another crack at the Uefa Cup would be a respectable achievement for a club still on a learning curve. The trouble is that Leeds finishing third was an assumption based on Besiktas finishing bottom, which would have been fine if only someone had remembered to tell the Turks. Now Leeds find themselves grateful for three points against Milan just to stay in touch with the group's perceived whipping boys. Anything is still possible in a group in which all four teams have one win and one defeat each, but the fact remains that three of the wins were by convincing margins, whereas Leeds' was something of a gift. </p> <p>So it is that Tuesday's home game against Besiktas will now shape the rest of Leeds' season. Nothing less than a win will do if Leeds are going to give themselves anything to look forward to. That's how the Champions League tends to greet newcomers - it chews them up, spits them out, and pays them handsomely for the privilege. It is a corrupting influence on English football and other domestic leagues, but the annoying thing is that you have to play by its rules to ever stand a chance. At least they have a manager who realises it. </p> <p>'The real priority is the Premiership and ensuring we are in Europe again next season,' the far from naive O'Leary said. 'It's not the time to panic or bring in players I don't particularly want. If we go out of the Champions League it won't be the end of the world.'</p>",
  "Serendipity is the most popular word in the English language, according to a poll conducted by the London Literary Festival. A term redolent of happy chance seems an odd choice for a nation with an anxiety complex the size of Cardiff, the flashpoint for the latest outbreak of mass hysteria. <p>On Tuesday, Warren Moore, drivetime presenter of the radio station, Red Dragon, made a facetious remark hinting at renewed petrol blockades. In normal times, his comment might have registered only with a Welsh hill farmer or two, a few, late-season pony-trekkers and a posse of longhorn sheep. Instead, countrywide queues built up, pumps ran dry, fuel replenishment was put back by a week and the Sun demanded: 'Have we all gone mad?' </p> <p>Apparently we have. As the phantom scare faded, more details emerged about the previous week's panic-buying. Somerfield, the high-street supermarket chain, reported that its customers did not restrict their shopping sprees to aisle wars over bread and milk. In addition, sales of deodorant, shampoo and shaving foam rose astronomically. Washing powder and cleaning fluids evaporated from the shelves as the public stockpiled against a pristine Armageddon. Had things got a micron more desperate, we would no doubt have been hoarding any mutant turnip left unsquelched by Lord Melchett and his newly-legitimised Greenpeace crop-tramplers. </p> <p>What to deduce from such irrational behaviour, beyond the fact that the bathroom cabinets of Middle Wallop are now stocked with sufficient anti-perspirant to sanitise every armpit in Mexico City? The social psychologists' explanation is simple. Collective behaviour is the glue of community and therefore a good thing until it is subverted by self-interest. Mass action of the me-first kind flourishes when people lack trust in central authority. Rumour and fear are sparked by lack of faith in official pronouncements. </p> <p>In an age of doubt and slick communication, the country prefers to take its cue from Wayne of Red Dragon rather than from a Prime Minister whose recent strategy on calming national panic seemed hardly more effective than that of a commuter shouting 'Sarin' on a Tokyo tube. But the drift in public faith is not primarily the fault of Blair, who, for all his vast majority, collected fewer votes in 1997 than Major did in 1992. Voter apathy means, in turn, that the parliamentary spectrum cannot reflect the wishes of the self-disenfranchised, who register their protest through other outlets. Hence what Steve Reicher, editor of the British Journal of Social Psychology, calls 'a crisis of democratic representation'. </p> <p>Or, as Martin Luther King put it: 'Crowds are the voice of the oppressed.' Mass movements, even with their overtones of panic and menace, are, at best, the engine of social change. The trouble is that the oppressed are a motley bunch with more or less righteous causes and justifiable tactics. From the Chartists to Seattle, the history of direct action is littered with the laudable and the loutish. All such crusades are cloaked in the one-size-fits-all mantle of worthy struggle and just ends. Group power of any sort teeters uneasily between the mild and the mad. </p> <p>So what provoked the most recent cocktail of protest and panic? Daniel Bell, the American sociologist and the father of the Third Way, would say that the deferred gratification of early capitalist production has yielded to instant fixes and grab-it-all hedonism. Whether panicking Persil-hoarders or Coutts-card fashion victims scouring the planet for the last pair of must-have Prada slingbacks, we are all mad consumers now. </p> <p>David Howell, in his new book, The Edge of Now, argues that current unrest will be stilled once we learn to love the global marketplace and rediscover the Victorian conflation of commerce and virtue. Perhaps so, but there never was a halcyon age of accord. The link between protest and the market has been going on since nineteenth-century food rioters discovered that an end to feudal structures equalled dearer grain. But in a modern democracy, the cult of direct action, only partly targeted on financial concerns, looks increasingly bizarre. Blankets of flowers for Diana, petrol bombs for the alleged paedophiles of the Paulsgrove estate, fox-hunters on the warpath, guerrilla gardeners trashing London: is this the normal cut-and-thrust of focus groups unleashed or a signal of something more sinister? </p> <p>Mob-mourning for Diana was always a leading indicator that the flood tide of British sentiment, if skewed to other ends, might turn nasty. The paedophile protest, conducted in the name of innocent children, proved just how vicious. </p> <p>Politicians, enjoined to 'listen', a synonym for 'cave in', have, at least until the petrol d\u00e9b\u00e2cle, riskily preferred emollience to condemnation when dealing with special interest groups. But stifling uproar can be a zero sum game, particularly when a febrile British public behaves as if, give or take a few screaming owls and crying crickets, we are all participants in the last act of Macbeth. </p> <p>Implicit in this mood is a justifiable suspicion that something odd is happening to democracy. When peaceful protesters against the Chinese President are bundled into police vans and anti-paedophile vigilantes are humoured, something is awry. When an unelected House Of Lords forces the retention of Section 28, its obduracy looks suspiciously like mob rule decked in ermine. And when Lord Melchett and 27 allies charged with criminal damage walk free from Norfolk Crown Court after admitting destroying a GM crop, it is truly time to reach for one's wallet. </p> <p>The verdict effectively means that hardliners, certain that the public cheers for them, will feel freer to wreak havoc with scientists' legitimate crop trials and besiege beleaguered farmers newly returned from manning the petrol barricades. This vicious circle of protest points up the power vacuum afflicting government. Although not responsible for the Melchett jury's call, politicians set the scene for clemency in failing to make the case that GM crops, potentially a vital future resource, should be properly tested. Instead, the debate became mired in charges of corporate exploitation and in a suspicion, undented so far, that the public, still understandably horrified by BSE, was being lined up for the vegetarian version. </p> <p>And so the crop protesters will be back. A neo-Luddite band emboldened now to consider themselves beyond the reach of the law, they are the latest ragtag army so easily conscripted in a post-industrial Britain where ideology falters and power belongs to any self-interest group with a mood-grabbing campaign and a wish to bend the Government to its will. The clout once applied by state or unions is mutating into what E.P. Thompson called 'collective bargaining by riot'. Public uprisings do occasionally pitch it right, as in the outcry for more money for the health service, but in the main, they specialise in the selfish, the blinkered and the vindictive. </p> <p>None of that might matter, except for the dangerous gulf between the brilliance of the strategy of internet-age direct action and the vacuity of its aims. The recent overall gain of twentieth-century protest, and its sideline of panic, is as follows: a stream of sex offenders driven underground, a freer hand to block legitimate scientific progress and a stash of superfluous shower gel. </p> <p>Such a tally might have puzzled those, from Luther King to Pankhurst, who made direct action the accelerator of social progress. Today, it seems more like its drag anchor. That is why Tony Blair's toughness towards petrol protesters is right. And why William Hague's moment of bonding with the 'fine, upstanding' citizens of the picket line will prove to be less than serendipitous.</p>",
  "<p>It is one of the deadliest new viruses to have emerged on the planet, and in the past few months it has begun to terrorise a growing list of victim nations. West Nile Fever looks set to become a global threat for the twenty-first century. </p> <p>Last month the disease killed 12 Israelis; France and Jordan reported outbreaks; and US scientists warned the disease has probably spread across the nation, threatening new eruptions in areas such as the Gulf coast. </p> <p>The bird-borne disease - which can trigger fatal inflammations of the brain, or encephalitis - caused panic when it broke out in America last year, killing seven New Yorkers. It was the first outbreak in the Western hemisphere. Researchers are still arguing over the cause, with some putting the blame on an infected bird that had been imported from Israel, while others said mosquitoes on airliners had spread the disease. </p> <p>The disease, spread from birds to humans via mosquitoes, returned to America's East Coast, with cases being identified in New York, New Jersey and Delaware. 'The disease is now firmly established in the US,' Dr Ernie Gould of the Institute of Virology and Environmental Microbiology, Oxford,said. 'It is there for good now. It is hard to see how on earth they can get rid of it.' </p> <p>The threat of West Nile has so alarmed Canadian health authorities they have decided to post chickens along its US border. Coops are being built from Saskatchewan to Atlantic Canada, creating a poultry version of Hadrian's Wall. The birds inside are scheduled to be tested regularly for West Nile viral antibodies, the aim being to give scientists an early warning of an impending outbreak. </p> <p>Such measures probably will prove futile. John Rappole and colleagues at the Smithsonian Institution's zoo in Front Royal, Virginia, have just reported, in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases , that they now believe more than 70 migratory species of bird, including ducks, starlings, terns and gulls, can carry the West Nile Fever virus, creating vast squadrons of avian hosts that can ferry the disease around the globe with impunity. </p> <p>'The virus is probably in every corner of North America by now,' as well as parts of South America, Rappole told New Scientist . The virus is usually harmless in healthy people but can cause deadly inflammations in the brains and spinal cords of immune suppressed or elderly patients. Most of those killed in the Israeli outbreak were in their eighties, for example. But although the disease has caused alarm in the West, it is by no means a new affliction to our planet. It is endemic from the Cape of Good Hope to Cairo. More than 80 per cent of Eygptians are infected at some time, though only older people run the risk of encephalitis. The disease is also widespread in the Middle East and India, and has appeared regularly in many parts of southern Europe. </p> <p>Three years ago, an outbreak of West Nile Fever, which is caused by a member of a group of viruses called flaviviruses, affected more than 500 people around Bucharest, Romania. More than 50 died. Other outbreaks occurred in southern Russia, Belarus, Ukraine and Italy. </p> <p>So why is the disease spreading? In many cases, human activities - new dams and irrigation works - are helping mosquitoes breed and spread West Nile, say scientists. Global warming may also be having an effect. </p> <p>'It is without doubt a nasty illness,' said neurologist Dr Tom Solomon, of Liverpool University. 'But we should not go overboard about it. Until last year no one knew about West Nile Fever, even though there had been several previous outbreaks in south Europe. It wasn't until New York was hit that the West gave a damn. Now we can't stop talking about it. </p> <p>'The situation is particularly ironic when you look at Japanese encephalitis, a virtually identical bird-born disease caused by a sibling virus. It affects more than 50,000 people a year in Asia, and kills 15,000 of them. It is much nastier, but we don't notice it because it has not yet touched the Western hemisphere. </p> <p>'In general, though, flaviviruses are going to be a real problem. We have not seen everything they can do yet. They are rapidly evolving entities and they are likely to adapt to all sorts of new ecological niches.' </p> <p>Indeed, flaviviruses have already adapted to cooler climates by abandoning mosquitoes and starting to use ticks as their intermediary hosts. One such illness has already appeared in Britain: louping-ill fever, which can decimate grouse populations and has triggered outbreaks of non-fatal meningo-encephalitis in humans. </p> <p>Additional research by Lucy Pogson</p>",
  "<p>Tony Blair may have had a tough time last week. But if he wants to know how much worse it could get, he should look across the North Sea to Denmark. There, his opposite number Poul Nyrup Rasmussen is fighting for his life over the defining issue of the age still clouding the UK horizon - Europe and, more specifically, its single currency. </p> <p>It is not just Rasmussen whose credibility is at stake. Employer and union leaders have together invested significant time and money in trying to persuade their people to accept something about which they are famously sceptical. </p> <p>The Danes are making them sweat. Daily Gallup polls published by the Berlingske Tidende newspaper ahead of this week's referendum on adopting the euro resemble a jagged pair of scissors - with Yes voters pointing down, and an eight point gap with the ascendant nay-sayers. </p> <p>The outcome of Thursday's plebiscite has profound consequences for the shape and direction of the European project. A No vote could not only knock the credibility of the juddering currency further; it will also make negative results in future referendums, due in Sweden as well as in Britain, far more likely. </p> <p>This would throw the heart of the project into doubt just as it is moving from consolidation to expansion. And it could place a new economic and political curtain between the far north-east of Europe and the teutonic mainland. </p> <p>But the notoriously independent Danes take a delicious pleasure in watching their leaders writhe. </p> <p>From the island-capital Copenhagen to the remote industrial towns of Jutland, 'Ja' and 'Nej' voters alike reserve their scorn for Rasmussen, their employers and the unions. </p> <p>Poul Nyrup has blundered, they say. The beleaguered yes coalition is 'ridiculous', 'panic-stricken', 'pathetic'. </p> <p>For business and unions, the situation could not be worse. Jorgen Hansen, deputy director-general of the employers' group Dansk Industri, says: 'It is important we get a Yes. In Denmark we have almost 100 per cent support for the euro among both big and small business. The unions are the same.' </p> <p>For their part, unions have warned of 35,000 job losses if there is a No. That represents 1.5 per cent of the workforce. </p> <p>But while industrial leaders may be convinced, their employees - particularly female workers and those in the public sector - are not. 'As we learnt in the 1992 referendum on Maastricht, they are suspicious of the elite,' says Hansen. </p> <p>The pro-euro coalition has been using its impeccable network to fight back. Rasmussen has been invited by companies far and wide to meet Denmark's workers and put the case for the single currency. </p> <p>On Tuesday morning, for example, he was speaking in an industrial estate in the Copenhagen suburb of Brondby, home to Denmark's stock market star, NKT holdings. </p> <p>This is the kind of business politicians like to be connected with. Founded in the nineteenth century, NKT now employs 6,500 people and is Denmark's foremost provider of telecommunications. Its shares rose 600 per cent after it spun off a chip designer to Intel earlier this year for $1.25 billion. </p> <p>Managing director Tom Knutzen represents the views of the frustrated majority of Europhile businessmen who are desperate to see a Yes vote on Thursday. 'This morning the Prime Minister in person was extremely dedicated and strongly believed in his arguments,' he says. 'In the Danish press it has been more difficult.' </p> <p>Similar concerns are found away from the Copenhagen media mel\u00e9e. Grundfos has been making domestic and industrial pumps in the town of Bjerringbro in Jutland since 1945, and now has about 10 per cent of the global market. </p> <p>This is another Danish success story. Investment has made the huge factories which dominate Bjerringbro - including an inhouse chip plant - into some of the most highly automated and modern facilities in Denmark. Rasmussen has taken his roadshow there too. </p> <p>Executive vice president Jens Jorgen Madsen says: 'We can't imagine that anyone can dream of saying No to the euro.' But he adds: 'The campaigning and debate have been at an ignorant level.' </p> <p>NKT and Grundfos have similar economic and commercial reasons for wanting to join - some of which will be familiar to UK businessmen: lower transaction costs, ease of trading, the attraction for domestic and inward investment. NKT does some 50 per cent of its business in the euro zone; for Grundfos the figure is 60 per cent. </p> <p>Madsen says: 'We do most of our trade there. We simply cannot understand how it would be better to be outside.' </p> <p>But they also point to specifically Danish factors - chief of which is that since 1982 the Danish krone has been linked first to the deutschmark and now to the euro. </p> <p>Hansen says this means there are major disadvantages to staying out: 'We must follow what the ECB does. But we have no influence at the committees.' </p> <p>And, as Knutzen points out, Danish businesses and taxpayers have to put up with higher debt costs while the krone is outside the euro. Base rates are half a percentage point higher than the ECB's. 'You will always pay a premium while you are outside.' </p> <p>Knutzen estimates that NKT is losing between DKr10 million and DKr20m a year by being 'out'. Grundfos calculates the figure at DKr10m a year for every percentage point above the ECB rate. </p> <p>Rasmussen has attempted to raise the stakes on the currency front. Speculators are ready to pounce on the DKr if it is 'weakened' by a No vote; Denmark has spent DKr10 billion defending the currency as the Yes campaign has lost ground. </p> <p>The difficulty is that, worrying as these problems are, raising them invites accusations of scaremongering. </p> <p>Analysts and economists point out that while in the short term there may be a base-rate hike of 100 points if Denmark stays out, the long-term differences are unlikely to be great - certainly not as great as in 1992. The effect on the level of the euro is less certain, as US and Japanese central banks intervened on Friday to defend it. </p> <p>The ascendant No campaign bridges left and right. </p> <p>Niels Meyer, a professor of physics and spokesman for the leftish June movement, says: 'Because we have referendums, the Danish people are very well informed. They remember the arguments from 1992 and leaders overstating economic problems. People can see that economic arguments are not the real concern.' </p> <p>Here Denmark diverges further from the UK. Current UK debate focuses on economic problems - manufacturing jobs and inward investment - reflecting the fortunes of sterling floating against the euro. </p> <p>But the Danes' first priority is democracy, says Meyer. 'The idea of a united states of Europe is something the Danes do not want. They believe the euro will be a quantum leap towards that.' </p> <p>Their second is welfare: 'The Nordic countries have high taxes, welfare and pensions. The rest of the EU has insurance, lower benefits, and lower taxes. With EU harmonisation, Denmark faces lower welfare and smaller pensions.' </p> <p>This sounds plausible, and it has whipped up a storm. Many believe the No campaign is on weak ground - but this is insignificant next to the mess Rasmussen has made of it. First he sought a deal with his coalition allies - the Conservatives and the liberal Venstre party - then he demanded that all EU governments guarantee that there would be no adverse effect on pensions. Panic, shouted his foes. </p> <p>Even Anders Jensen of the pro-euro European Movement says: 'Rasmussen badly overreacted to the pensions issue.' </p> <p>Jensen also admits the supremacy of political arguments. Back in March, when the referendum was declared, a report by the Danish Independent Economic Council - dubbed the Danish Wise Men - found that the economic benefits of membership were negligible. He believes this is wrong. </p> <p>At the same time, fears about loss of sovereignty were heightened by the EU sanctions imposed on Austria after the election win of far-right politician J\u00f6rg Haider. Danes were outraged at the breach of sovereignty. </p> <p>Jensen says: 'There is a balance between the economic gain of entry and the political cost. The Wise Men said there was little gain; the Austrian situation pointed to a great loss.' The polls have criss-crossed ever since. </p> <p>Now, with the vote closing fast, even businessmen concede it is the political issues that are commanding attention. </p> <p>Knutzen says: 'Europe has a history of war, both military and economic. The euro is an answer to the economic warfare of competitive devaluation and so on. It is an attempt to harmonise economic activity and economic growth.' </p> <p>But opponents can use these arguments, too. </p> <p>Sceptical businessman Kresten Bjerre, who runs an internet service provider, says: 'When countries like Greece, France, Spain, Italy and Ireland get together, is it going to be stable? Who knows. I say wait and see.' </p> <p>Looking back on the campaign, Grundfos ruefully admits: 'The Nos have used dirty tricks, like the pensions issue.' </p> <p>The pro-euro Jensen puts it differently: 'Our arguments are difficult to make, because they sometimes do not seem logical - even though they are true. The Nos are on easier rhetorical ground. As they say, the Devil has all the best tunes.' </p> <p>Meanwhile, out on the streets, the Danes are dancing merrily while the music lasts. As we have learnt in the past two weeks, the British would enjoy such an opportunity too.</p>",
  "<p>Not very long ago, William Aikens, a former US ambassador to Saudi Arabia, said: 'When the oil price rises above $30 a barrel, Saddam Hussein will be treated like Mother Teresa.' His statement sums up the indisputable connection between petroleum price, Iraq (possessing the second-largest oil reserves in the world) and Washington's policy towards Saddam. </p> <p>With Iraq producing 3.6 million barrels per day (bpd), its highest output ever, the removal of a United Nations' ceiling on its petroleum sales in January, and American oil corporations buying up a third of its oil exports, Saddam has become a major player in the market. </p> <p>This was acknowledged implicitly by America when Secretary of State Madeleine Albright announced recently that Washington would not use force to compel Iraq to accept inspectors of the newly formed UN Monitoring and Ongoing Verification and Inspection Commission (Unmovic). She then joined the UN ambassadors of Russia, France and China in urging Unmovic chief, Hans Blix, not to force the issue. </p> <p>This has enabled Saddam to become active, rather than reactive, in his foreign affairs. Hence his recent claim that by carrying out horizontal drilling near the Kuwait-Iraq border, Kuwait was stealing 300,000 barrels per day of Iraqi petroleum. </p> <p>Hence, too, his letter to the UN Security Council holding Saudi Arabia responsible for the losses that Baghdad suffered when Riyadh closed the oil pipeline from southern Iraq to the Saudi Red Sea port of Yanbo in August 1990. </p> <p>Saddam's aim in putting Kuwait and Saudi Arabia - big petroleum producers - on the defensive is to destabilise the oil market and spike up the price. He knows well how tight the current world petroleum market is - thanks chiefly to thriving economies all around the globe - and how vulnerable the US is on the issue of oil imports. </p> <p>Today 60 per cent of the 19 million barrels of oil Americans consume daily comes from abroad, double the levels seen in 1983. And the trend is set to continue. </p> <p>In the Nineties, oil output in the US declined by 15 per cent, while consumption rose by 11 per cent. With less than 5 per cent of the world population, America consumes 25 per cent of world oil output. It sucks up all the petroleum exports of Canada, Mexico and Venezuela. And it is becoming increasingly dependent on imports from the Gulf region, including Iraq. </p> <p>As soon as Iraq accepted the UN-administered oil-for-food scheme in December 1996, allowing it to sell $2 billion worth of petroleum in six months to buy food and medicine, Washington let it be known that US companies were free to buy Iraqi oil. </p> <p>And they did - for two years. Then, enraged by Operation Desert Fox, the Penta gon's 100-hour blitzkrieg against Iraq in mid-December 1998, Saddam ordered that no Iraqi oil be sold to American companies. </p> <p>But that did not happen. Indeed, according to the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, Iraq emerged as the fastest-growing source of US petroleum imports in 1999. </p> <p>US companies bought about a third of their Iraqi oil imports through foreign intermediaries. Their tankers loaded the commodity at an Iraqi oil terminal and sailed directly to American ports, often in the Gulf of Mexico. </p> <p>'The Chevrons and the Exxons of this world have to buy [Iraqi oil] from the Russians, the French and the Chinese traders,' said Larry Goldstein, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation. </p> <p>Saddam is well aware of the shipment of Iraqi oil directly to the US. 'That doesn't bother him,' said Vahe Petrossian, a London-based oil expert. 'By banning direct sales to American companies, Saddam deprived them of their trading profits. These now go to the middlemen from countries friendly with Baghdad - Russia, France and China.' </p> <p>Part of the reason for US corporations seeking out Iraqi crude is that an American law prohibits them from purchasing oil from Iran, Opec's second largest producer, whose output is on a par with Iraq's. </p> <p>All this is part of Washington's Dual Containment pol icy towards Tehran and Baghdad, adopted in May 1993. But the policy has been in tatters for the past four years, a fact the Clinton administration refuses to recognise. </p> <p>When it comes to repairing Iraq' rundown petroleum industry, the European subsidiaries of US oil equipment firms are in the forefront. Since mid-1998, making bids through their foreign subsidiaries and affiliates, more than a dozen US corporations have signed tens of millions of dollars'-worth of contracts with Iraq for oil-producing equipment . </p> <p>With the UN allowing Iraq to spend an average of $100m a month on repairing its petroleum industry, the pickings are rich. </p> <p>In July, Unmovic announced with much fanfare that its 44 inspectors from 19 countries were to take a month-long training course at New York's Columbia University to familiarise themselves with the historical, legal, administrative and political aspects of inspections and monitoring, and to become 'sensitive' to Iraqi culture. </p> <p>The snag is that Iraq has refused to accept last December's UN Security Council Resolution 1284, setting up Unmovic. So when Unmovic boss Blix said in August that a small team of his inspectors were ready to go to Iraq, his progress report was received with embarrassment rather than enthusiasm by the US. Half of the Unmovic inspectors have returned home. </p> <p>In the words of Henry Kissinger, a former US Secretary of State: 'Countries do not have friends or foes; they have interests.' And no interest is higher or more important in America than to keep gas-guzzling cars running, and homes and offices heated in winter. </p> <p>If that requires supping with the devil - renamed Saddam - so be it. </p> <p><strong>Rolling out the barrels: the supply chain</strong></p> <p><strong> Crude</strong> <br> When the price of oil was only $10 a barrel, in early 1998, Opec countries dependent on foreign earnings tried to bump it up to around $20 by cutting production to 2.6 million barrels a day in March and June. Nothing happened. They tried again with a 1.7 million cut in March: the price soared to $30 early this year. </p> <p>US pressure and concern that high prices were not in Opec's interest led to three production increases this year - 1.7 million barrels a day in March, 700,000 in June and 800,000 in September. But the price has not budged, because: </p> <p>\u0095 The shambolic quota system is inexact and often broken by Opec members. </p> <p>\u0095 Demand for oil is rising. </p> <p>\u0095 Crude is only one link in a complicated oil supply chain. </p> <p><strong> Shipping</strong> <br>The next link is shipping crude to market. The price charged by tanker owners to do this had gone up from $17,000 a day in September last year to $73,000 a day last month, says shipping broker Clarkson. This has raised shipping costs per barrel from around 60 cents to $2.60. The rise has been driven by a rebound after the Asian crisis, the scrapping of ships and demand for safer double-hulled vessels. </p> <p><strong> Refining</strong> <br>Next comes refining crude into products from petrol to heating oil. Refiners in Europe and the US were running below capacity last January. Now they are almost flat out, according to the Centre for Global Energy Studies. But as they have raised capacity, demand has risen, too. In the spring, US petrol stocks were down to 25 days. A massive rise in capacity had failed to lift that beyond 23 days by August. The result: higher prices at the pumps. The petrol problem is at last receding, only to be replaced by a similar difficulty over winter heating oil. </p> <p>\u0095 Dilip Hiro is the author of 'Dictionary of the Middle East', published by Macmillan, price \u00a320.</p>",
  "<p>An international game of pass the parcel is emerging this weekend about who or what is to blame for the high oil price and what action, if any, could make it fall. </p> <p>Fears about the high cost of oil and its downstream derivatives are driving a high-stakes game of geopolitics, involving the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, the US presidential elections, and futures market traders in New York and London. Black gold is high on the agenda in Prague for worried leaders at the G7 summit of industrialised nations. </p> <p>In the US a combination of economic and political effects led to the unprecedented release of oil reserves by President Bill Clinton. </p> <p>The wild card in the pack is this week's Opec heads of state meeting in Caracas - only the second such gathering in the organisation's history. The timing could not be better, coming as the cartel thrusts itself back on to the world stage from the brink of irrelevance, and in the immediate wake of the US's intervention. </p> <p>So what can make oil cheaper? Not surprisingly, it depends who you ask: it's Opec or it's extra refining capacity; it's a matter of using strategic reserves, or a question of rectifying the irrational exuberance of futures markets. </p> <p>In Prague the heads of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank are fret ting at the prospect of oil shaving fractions of percentage points off world growth, and boosting inflation. The double-headed hydra of high oil prices affecting economies in the long term and voters in the short term was largely unforeseen. The French government is using the G7 meeting to propose an informal summit between the European Union, the US and the oil-producing countries. </p> <p>In the US, oil has become a political issue because of the high prices and because the Republican presidential running mates, George W Bush and Dick Cheney, have strong connections with 'Big Oil'. It was Al Gore, the Democrat candidate, who stirred the pot by getting Clinton to release some of the US's strategic reserve of 571 million barrels. </p> <p>Similar moves from the other G7 nations are now possible. In emergencies a mechanism exists through the International Energy Agency, the energy market watchdog of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, to release portions of the agency's reserve of about 1.2bn barrels. This oil was last used in the Gulf War, and was on standby for millennium computer bug problems. </p> <p>IEA countries could decide to make a co-ordinated intervention to dampen down speculative hysteria. But the notion of high prices as an 'emergency' is unprecedented. For now, efforts are concentrated on the more traditional channels of polite diplomacy to secure a production increase from Opec. </p> <p>William Ramsay, deputy executive director of the IEA, said: 'Frankly, Opec have not shared their agenda with us, though one of the clearest reasons may be to celebrate 40 years of existence.' </p> <p>The world leaders in Prague may be worried, but the Opec guests in Caracas, the Venezuelan capital, will be ebullient. The city has been given an extra lick of paint. In the run-up to the summit, a three-month cultural festival featuring Opec member states' work included Kuwaiti art exhibitions and demonstrations of Venezuelan basketry. The meeting is the high point of a process of Opec reconstruction, largely propelled by the feisty Venezuelan president, Hugo Chavez. </p> <p>He travelled around the Middle East to deliver personal invitations to the conference, promising to visit Saddam Hussein even if he had to go to Iraq by camel or skateboard. Saddam and Libya's Colonel Gadaffi declined their invitations on security grounds, but the trip and the rhetoric surrounding it caught the eye of oil markets mindful of a possible return of the oil militancy of the mid-Seventies. </p> <p>However, Opec insiders say this should not be seen as a return to the sabre-rattling of that era. 'If Opec then could be considered a rebellious teenager,' its general secretary, Dr Rilwanu Lukman, said last week, 'I am happy to say that now, as its fortieth birthday nears, the organisation has gained the maturity that comes with age.' </p> <p>Opec will attempt to forge stronger links with other oil-producing nations, such as Mexico and Russia. Norway, which is a member of the IEA but has followed Opec output price trends in the past has sent an observer to Caracas. Senior analysts suggest Opec may achieve the spectacular diplomatic coup of admitting Russia to the cartel. </p> <p>If the heads of state really do want to make a difference beyond the diplomatic pomp and circumstance of the summit, they will find the scale and timing of any intervention in the market very difficult to judge. </p> <p>Opec members are notoriously bad at breaking quotas. It is also difficult to tell how other elements in the supply chain, from shipping costs and refining capacity to final demand for oil products, will play out. On top of this, oil markets - including Nymex in New York and London's International Petroleum exchange - are hard to read. Any production rise aimed at pushing the price into the band favoured by economists, Opec and consumers - between $22 and \u00a328 a barrel - is liable to cause a crash. </p> <p>'Opec has increased production this year much more than necessary,' Chavez told Venezuelans on TV last week. </p> <p>He said suggestions that Opec could increase production by 2.2 million barrels per day were exaggerated: the cartel was already producing in excess of world demand. Opec says the high price is not a result of a an oil shortage, but a lack of refinery capacity and futures market speculation. </p> <p>Refineries across the industrialised world are running flat out. Some have been doing so for months, and will have to shut for maintenance in October. If this is the bottleneck, increasing production of crude, or releasing reserves, may ease crude prices in the short term, but it is unlikely to cut the retail cost of petrol and heating oil. </p> <p>The IEA is not convinced. 'The numbers being put around - that Opec took 4 million barrels off the market, have put 3 million back in, and in the meantime demand has increased production by 2 million barrels - speak for themselves. I don't think you can explain the fragility in today's market by futures trading,' says Ramsay. </p> <p>The key to understanding where oil prices may be heading lies in the dark world of the futures markets. The oil market is distorted in such a way that it doesn't pay to store oil. Oil companies, refineries and speculators can make profits by running down their stocks and buying cheaper future supplies. This arises partly because of the uncertain intentions of the global oil market players, from Opec to governments and oil companies. </p> <p>The oil markets are, to use the jargon, 'backwardated'. This means speculators believe supply increases by Opec and changes in global demand will eventually come into balance, bringing the price of oil down from their present dizzy levels. As a result oil on the futures market is cheaper than the current or 'spot' price. </p> <p>If the Opec heads of state make any increase in production, it will have to be finely judged. Analysts believe that to bring the price down, any rise will have to be significant - more than a million barrels per day on top of the 800,000 rise announced earlier this month. </p> <p>However, such an increase is likely to produce a shock similar in scale to that following the March 1999 1.7 million cut, which triggered a massive oil price rise. But this time, of course, prices would slump. </p> <p>That would reverse the current 'backwardated' market, and create conditions of 'contango', where massive current supply puts the spot price below the futures price. </p> <p>Leo Drollas of the Centre for Global Energy Studies says: 'It is highly likely that we will reach contango soon: we will be awash with crude and the spot price will collapse. If I could say when that was I'd be in Monte Carlo. But I'd say it's likely in the first quarter of next year.' </p> <p>Robert Mabro, of the Oxford Institute for Energy studies, says: 'Unfortunately it seems that an oil shock is the only method of correcting these extreme prices, so you bounce back and forth from $10 to $33.' </p> <p>The likelihood of oil price ping-pong prevents Opec from making any production response that will have an impact on the market. </p> <p>In these conditions, a more likely cause of a significant fall in the price is smaller-than-expected demand caused by an exceptionally mild winter. A harsher winter, with everything else equal, will keep the market 'backwardated' and the price high. </p> <p>Industry analysts believe Clinton's intervention could backfire. Refineries will look for every means possible to sell crude from the reserve on the spot market and buy futures - undermining the effect of the reserve oil on product prices. Whether they succeed depends on the price at which the reserve is released, and how effective the US government is at policing abuse. </p> <p>'Refiners are clever,' said one analyst. 'They'll always find a way to beat the system.' </p> <p>There is also a risk that Opec might reverse some of the production increases in response to the unprecedented release of reserves. And then where would we be?</p>",
  "<b> Elizabeth Browne, 35 Abbeymeads, Swindon, housewife</b> <p> I'm a long-term Labour supporter and I thought Tony Blair would probably have some radical, forward-looking ideas. He was right not to give in to the protesters, but Brown's reaction was harsh and provocative. I don't think that they handled it that well. I don't know if it's just the press, but it seems that hospital waiting lists are longer. My father, who lives in France, came to visit and was flabbergasted at the price of food and petrol. </p> <p> <b> Kamal Ladwa, 21 Freshbrook, Swindon, Student at Nottingham University</b> </p> <p> Labour have a tough job to do. I don't have a car, but the petrol crisis affected my lifts everywhere. It's a Catch 22 situation - I'm all right with fuel being taxed highly because of the environment. There's been no change in the NHS. I went for an operation recently. The NHS made me wait a month, so I had it done privately. It cost me \u00a31,000. There are no good options to vote for at the moment. The Dome was a joke, but I suppose the Conservatives would have done the same. </p> <p> <b> Pauline Venables, 75 Upper Stratton, Swindon, pensioner</b> </p> <p> I've voted Labour all my life. My husband and I share a state pension of \u00a3120 a week. My children pay my heating bills and so I manage to live comfortably. </p> <p>There's so much dissatisfaction at the moment; I've never heard so many Labour people complaining. </p> <p> There was not enough explanation by Labour for their position on the fuel strike, other than that they wouldn't give in to the protesters - who had a genuine grievance. </p> <p> <b> Jason Rickards, 30 Abbeymeads, Swindon, Business analyst</b> </p> <p> I was pleased when the fuel strikes happened. I get the bus every day and want to see more people using public transport,which, in this area, has improved. I voted for Labour in 1997 because I thought we needed a change. I liked their fresh approach, and I liked Blair: he's strong-willed and he knows what he wants. It's not really old Labour, but our generation likes it. If you look at the overall picture, we have 1.9 per cent inflation, interest rates lower than Germany and around one million people unem ployed. What's a few pence on petrol? I'd like to see Labour focus more on their successes. I can't understand their relationship with the press. People don't believe them; the spinning is out of control. They have to do something about that. </p> <p> <b> James Kent, 30 Stratton, Swindon, Taxi driver</b> </p> <p> I regret voting Labour in 1997. I seem to be worse off in virtually every respect. Fuel prices are rising, and my mortgage goes up every month. Blair didn't react to the fuel crisis that well. He told absurd lies - trying to get everyone to believe the NHS was on its knees. The protests were a long time coming, and we haven't seen the last of them. I'd be part of them myself if I had enough fuel to get there. With business as it is, I can't hold on for much longer. I can't see the country going any further with this government. They've lied, cheated and are fraudulent and corrupt. As for voting Labour, I won't be doing that again. </p>",
  "<p>A black day. Mob rule. A green light to wanton vandalism. A blow against the rule of law. It was clear from the papers that the end of civilisation was finally upon us. And who was responsible for this cataclysmic event? Seven men and five women, chosen at random from the electoral roll: the Norwich jury which found 28 Greenpeace volunteers, including me, not guilty of criminal damage. I expected the establishment reaction to be hostile - it was hysterical. </p> <p>The charge arose from an action by Greenpeace when we tried to remove a crop of genetically modified maize from a field near Lyng. The prosecution alleged that it was a stunt. We proved we acted lawfully in defence of property. The crop was about to flower, threatening cross-pollination of neighbouring crops. Once such genetic pollution escaped, it could not be recalled. We aimed to cut down and bag up the entire field and return it to Aventis, the agrochemical company that owned the crop. </p> <p>The owner of the field had refused to meet his neighbours to discuss whether they wanted GM crops in the vicinity. He and the chemical company decided simply to impose the contamination on them. The real victims of this episode are the local farmers who may not be able to sell crops contaminated by GM. </p> <p>Genetic engineering is a complex issue, probably the most complex and certainly one of the most serious Greenpeace has ever grappled with. But what has been the response of the liberal media and London salon society which have promoted deliberative democracy with such fervour? Shocked indignation that the jurors have had the temerity to challenge what they assumed to be scientific certitude. </p> <p>There seem to be two key objections to what we did: that we seemed to challenge the need for scientific progress; and we took direct action. The Government tells us the farm-scale trials will show whether GM crops pose a threat to human health or the environment. This is just not true - the trials are not about human health at all, even though the Government claims that they are. Nor are they about whether GM crops will contaminate non-GM ones; the Government and its scientific experts long ago accepted that contamination is inevitable, but think it does not matter. </p> <p>Nor are they about whether GM crops will pollute the soil they grow in. They are simply about whether farmers growing GM crops will use more or less weedkiller, a question which could have been answered by looking at the experience of GM crop cultivation in North America. We know that the answer is mixed - sometimes more chemicals are used, sometimes less. </p> <p>We do not need GM crops to reduce our dependence on chemical weedkillers - we need research into fulfilling the potential of organic farming. The farm scale trials aim to establish something we do not need to know, at a risk of irreparable damage to the environment. To oppose them is not to be anti-science, but simply to recognise that there are some things which cannot be justified in the name of science. </p> <p>And what of direct action? I believe it is a legitimate tactic, but only in some forms and in clearly defined circumstances. First and most important, it must be non-violent. Second, it should be used only after other avenues have been explored. Third, it should be in defence of a clear moral principle, not an attempt to impose the economic self-interest of a particular group on the rest of society. Fourth, it should be to prevent a real and immediate threat, such as genetic pollution. </p> <p>Greenpeace disagrees with the aims of those who blockaded refineries - the true cost of petrol and diesel, taking account of climate change and damage to human health, is far higher than the price we pay at the pumps - and with their methods. It was a clearly implied threat and self-interested, motivated by issues often unrelated to transport. </p> <p>There is another important point about Greenpeace's involvement in direct action. We do not conceal our identities or evade arrest. We challenge particular laws, but not the rule of law. We take responsibility for our actions and are happy to be judged, fairly, for them.</p>",
  "<p>Sometimes the smallest explosions have the greatest impacts. When Victor Chandler, a little known bookmaker serving big spending punters, moved his entire operation to the tax haven of Gibraltar in 1997 he detonated a small limpet mine which capsized the entire UK betting industry. </p> <p>The shockwaves are still being felt today. The big-name bookmakers, such as Ladbrokes, were forced to follow Chandler overseas, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, once confident of making around \u00a3500 million a year from betting duties, was left scratching his head. </p> <p>Chandler laughs when he recalls the way his larger rivals followed him abroad. 'They had to do it,' he says. 'Otherwise we'd have had all their business.' </p> <p>Not only did his actions give Gordon Brown something to think about, Chandler's adept use of new technology now has serious consequences for the high street. It would take a very optimistic punter to bet on a rosy future for the UK's 8,500 betting shops as a result of Chandler's run to the sun. Telephone and internet betting may have accounted for only around 10 per cent of all the money staked in the UK last year but it is set for huge growth. According to analysts at Datamonitor, online betting in Europe could be worth as much as as \u00a33.5 billion by 2004. </p> <p>Okay, there is a chance Customs and Excise will challenge the UK bookmakers' actions, but it is hard to see what they can do, now that the horses have effectively bolted. At present the Government can merely prevent the likes of Chandler adver tising in the UK. But click on to any of the big online bookmakers' UK-based sites and you will be offered the chance to jump through to its offshore cousin. </p> <p>Certainly the Bahamas-based billionaire Joe Lewis thinks Chandler's business represents the future of betting. He liked the company so much that in August last year he bought it. Enic, Lewis's international investment company, valued Victor Chandler International (VCI) at around \u00a365m. Chandler and his partner, Monaco-based millionaire racehorse owner Michael Tabor, will each retain stakes of around 20 per cent in the company. The deal seemed to have been sidelined over the past few months, but Chandler is adamant that it will now go through by November. </p> <p>The Enic deal, Chandler argues, will give VCI the chance to become a truly global online player. 'There's no doubt that we've got to have the cash to market ourselves. In four or five years' time there will be only four or five players in the world betting market.' </p> <p>Chandler had one eye on what the big US gaming giants might be looking to do in Europe. 'We needed to do a deal because we've got to establish our position quickly now.' </p> <p>Apart from Lewis, Chandler also rubs shoulders with another famous businessman. Terry Ramsden, who was once Britain's fifty-seventh richest man but ended up becoming one of the country's most famous bankrupts after running up gambling losses of more than \u00a3100m, also does business with Chandler. </p> <p>'He has brought several deals to the table, one of which is a smartcard idea,' Chandler says. 'He's someone I' have known since he was the biggest punter in the Eighties.' </p> <p>Sitting in the London Ritz sipping white wine, he outlines his plans for moving forward. All last week his staff were offering commuters at London train stations a chance to win a Porsche by betting on what the Dow Jones would close at on Friday. </p> <p>This was to launch Marketbet, VCI's new pools-style game which allows punters to bet on the performance of stock markets instead of football matches. Some may question whether the UK needs another pools game, but Chandler has been successful in backing his hunches before. He was one of the first bookmakers to realise that there was huge interest from overseas clients and so, for a while, Chandler looked at developing an offshore tax-free business to run in tandem with his UK operations. </p> <p>Originally, Chandler considered setting up his operation in Jersey, but that deal fell through, so in 1996 he acquired a betting licence from a casino owner in Gibraltar. The start of Chandler's overseas operations was fairly inauspicious. 'There was just six of us in an office with mobile phones,' Chandler says, puffing on a Camel full strength. </p> <p>The decision to move the company's entire operation abroad was a gamble. Chandler, who gave up working as a hotel consultant in the Balearic Islands to take over the family bookmaking business when his father died in 1974, had not planned such a dramatic move. For much of the Eighties and Nineties he had been content to buy the odd bookmaker and sell it on to one of the big betting firms. </p> <p>But in 1997, Chandler read that the Irish government was to cut betting tax from nearly 10 per cent to 5 per cent. This was a huge threat to Chandler, who feared losing clients to Irish bookies. He resolved to move Victor Chandler, lock stock and barrel, to Gibraltar, where the business would not have to pay any betting tax at all. </p> <p>Now Chandler wants to launch online casinos, and there are also plans to develop Marketbet so that punters can bet on individual companies' shares. In addition, all the company's websites will be translated into Chinese and Spanish, opening up new markets. During Euro 2000 the company took bets from punters in 40 countries. It already boasts 24,000 regular internet customers, and plans to develop broadband and mobile phone betting are also on the cards. </p> <p>But Chandler, who, with 350 staff, is now one of Gibraltar's biggest employers, is keen to target new audiences through the internet: 'We've got to have a range of products. There's no reason why on the internet you can't play skill games for something as small as a 5p bet. We'll also be extending the games to take in trivia in the future.' </p> <p>But while Chandler is an advocate of new technology, does he believe it could end up encouraging more people to gamble? 'Everyone's a lot more relaxed about gambling now,' he says. 'You can compare it to drinking. There will be casualties, but they'll always be in the minority.' </p> <p>While the jump to the Rock has made Chandler rich, it has its downside. 'I miss the racing: throughout the Eighties, at the tracks it was leisure rather than work.' </p> <p><strong>Profile</strong></p> <p><strong> Subject: </strong> Victor Chandler </p> <p><strong> Born: </strong> 18 April 1951 </p> <p><strong> Job: </strong> Chairman and chief executive, Victor Chandler International </p> <p><strong> Other Directorships: </strong> None </p> <p><strong> Hobbies: </strong> The turf, breeding horses, riding</p>",
  "Now we know with what contempt your Leader writer (mob), Andrew Rawnsley (Sierra man), Jonathon Porritt (insufferable arrogance) and sundry pundits and politicians think of the general public (Comment, last week). Most of us, including Volvo Estate and 4WD man, support the protesters. <p>Those opposed to the protest hardly notice the price of energy and are happy not to pay more than a marginal 40 per cent income tax or 20 per cent company tax when their accountants can't avoid it. </p> <p>So far as global warming is concerned, we are not as stupid as you presume. As any teacher will tell you, you do not get cooperation by beating with sticks or insults, even with carrots added. High energy costs impinge on the poor more than the rich, so when the next protest starts I, and I trust my fellow insultees, will be there on the picket lines with our shell suits and Zimmer frames. <br><b> C.G. Sinclair</b><br> Manchester </p> <p>\u0095 Well said, Jonathon Porritt. Now all we need is a public rebuff of the misguided, self-righteous protesters. </p> <p>Does it not occur to the protesters that the silent acceptance of the inconvenience and costs arising from their actions is no surer sign of support than the apathy which most of us have previously been accepting the Government's policies? <br> <b> Ivan White </b> <br>Bedford </p> <p>\u0095 There is more than a whiff of paranoia in Margaret Beckett's reaction to the oil blockaders. The protesters looked and talked like ordinary people, and didn't 96 per cent of the public support them? </p> <p>To regard ordinary people as 'the enemy' (the same ordinary people who gave Blair his landslide victory in 1997) is an anti-democratic, almost Stalinist reaction by New Labour. Are these ordinary people now to be 'crushed', rather than their legitimate grievances on fuel tax listened to? <br><b> Rosemary Brian </b> <br>Croyde, Devon </p> <p>\u0095 After all that has been written about the 'petrol crisis', have other readers begun to have an uneasy feeling that there has been a slightly sinister political undertone to the whole affair? </p> <p>We are told that it was a 'totally spontaneous' event by ordinary people - that being the case, how was it that those described as 'leaders' outside the various depots all seemed to know each other and be able to communicate instantly by mobile phone? </p> <p>And why did the name 'Countryside Alliance' keep cropping up; I thought that organisation was only interested in keeping foxhunting alive and our rural species of songbirds dead? <br><b> Leslie Fraser-Mitchell </b> <br>Swaffham, Norfolk </p> <p>\u0095 The crisis highlights the folly and injustice of relying too much on indirect taxation as a source of revenue, because this takes a larger proportion of poor people's income than rich people's. </p> <p>Progressive income tax, where those who are wealthy contribute at a higher rate to society's needs than those who are not well off, is the most equitable method. </p> <p>I think Tony Blair's greatest mistake was made before the election when he promised not to raise income tax, even on the highest earners. <br><b> Christine Speirs </b> <br>Cambridge</p> <p>\u0095 During the miners' and steelworkers' strikes, many motor transport drivers betrayed their fellow workers by blacklegging, and then boasting on TV how much money they made. </p> <p>As one that stood on the steelworkers' picket, I felt they were below contempt. It is a fallacy to say they did not break the law in the petrol blockade. Obstruction and more than six pickets are offences, but I did not see much enthusiasm on the part of the police to do anything about it. </p> <p>While I feel that petrol prices are too high, I voted for a government to deal with economic matters, not a bunch of farmers and truck drivers. <br><b> F.R. Evans</b> <br>Chichester, W. Sussex </p> <p>\u0095 Should farmers choose to plunge us into another fuel crisis by obstructing terminals, I trust the relevant authorities will be checking the tractor blockades to see which vehicles are running illegally on red diesel. </p> <p>This fuel, designated for agricultural, horticultural and forestry use in vehicles allowed to travel a maximum of 1.5kms on public roads, attracts a duty of just 3.13p/litre, making the pump price around 25p/litre. </p> <p>Of course, our poorly done-by farmers still have to pay full pump price to run their Range Rovers, but I wonder how many other businesses wish they could pay so little for one of their primary fuel sources. <br><b> Nic Davies</b><br> Burton-upon-Trent, Staffs</p>",
  "As real estate deals go, it is hardly major league: a string of tiny, uninhabited dots of land on the market for offers above \u00a375,000. But the sale of Aber, Torrinch and Creinch, three of Loch Lomond's most beautiful islands, has provoked a far bigger row than either their size or asking price would seem to warrant. <p>The islands have gone on the open market amid grave concern from local conservationists that by selling them to the highest bidder, their unique, unspoilt character may be jeopardised. </p> <p>To the fury of locals, the estate agent handling the sale, the Edinburgh office of FPD Savills, is marketing the islands as a haven for city dwellers looking for a place to act out their own version of the BBC television series Castaway 2000 . </p> <p>In the wake of the rows over the high-profile sales of Ben Nevis and the Black Cuillin mountain range on Skye, campaigners are now calling on Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) and the National Trust for Scotland to step in and save a smaller but equally significant slice of landscape for the nation. </p> <p>There is a legend of Loch Lomond that its islands float on the surface, and the quality of the light playing on the water is such that Aber, Torrinch and Creinch never appear to be in the same position twice. They are regarded as pristine, bite-size examples of how Scotland's scenery may have developed without the interference of man. </p> <p>The islands are covered in native tree and plant species such as oak, alder and Scots pine, all untouched by the encroachment of civilisation. A few capercaillies enjoy the run of the thick undergrowth without fear of being disturbed, unlike those on the mainland which are battling for survival as their natural habitats disappear. </p> <p>In spring, Creinch - Island of the Trees - is carpeted with wild garlic, hyacinths and wood anemones, while the Aber, a smudge of land that is submerged for most of the year, is an important roosting place for many migratory birds. Torrinch, the largest and most dramatic of the islands at 19 acres, and Creinch are geologically important. They form part of a submerged ridge that marks the fault line in the continental shelf dividing the Highlands from lowland Scotland. </p> <p>The sale is born out of tragedy. Under Crown charter, the islands have been in the Buchanan family estate since 1708 and their future should have been secure. The last owner, Lady Leith-Buchanan, had struggled to keep the estate afloat but she was determined to protect the islands, so she entered a management agreement with SNH 13 years ago to bring them under the Loch Lomond National Nature Reserve. </p> <p>But last year 95-year-old Lady Leith-Buchanan was killed in a fire which swept through her cottage in Gartocharn. The trustees of her estate are now being forced to sell the islands to settle her debts, pay off death duties and to raise money for the care of her daughter, Helen, 50, who is severely disabled by Parkinson's disease. Jock Scott-Park, one of the trustees, said: 'We are doing this with very deep regret. We have simply been left with no choice but to sell.' </p> <p>The islands are designated Sites of Special Scientific Interest and are protected under European legislation as Special Areas of Conservation. But though the management agreement with SNH still has 12 years to run, local campaigners fear that unless the new owner is dedicated to the islands' preservation, there is no way of guaranteeing their future beyond then. </p> <p>They are also concerned that the advent of the new Loch Lomond and Trossachs National Park will do more to confuse their status than to safeguard it. The legislation for the park does not give conservation top priority, instead making it only one of four competing aims. </p> <p>Hannah Stirling, co-founder and president of the Friends of Loch Lomond group, which is leading the campaign, said: 'We understand completely why the sale has to take place but it is a tragedy that such an important piece of Scotland's natural heritage can be sold off to highest bidder.' </p> <p>She is furious that Savills is trying to attract buyers on the back of the Castaway 2000 series. Issuing an appeal to 'would-be castaways', the agent's promotional material states: 'With the return of Castaway 2000 ... the focus of TV viewers may well switch from the urban environment of Big Brother and islands will be back in the news. Now comes your chance to acquire your very own island or islands and play at castaway to your heart's content.' </p> <p>'I am absolutely disgusted by Savills,' Stirling said. 'This is no way to advertise something so precious as these islands.' </p> <p>SNH would consider giving support, including financial help, to any organisation, such as the Friends, which wanted to buy the islands for conservation purposes. But spokesman George Anderson said: 'We shouldn't become obsessed by the idea that we have to own every important piece of land. Ownership matters less to us than what happens with the islands.' </p> <p>Neil Kay, the selling agent for Savills which is also handling the Cuillins sale, said: 'We see it as very much conservation-minded people who might be interested in this sale. There is no possibility of ever building on these islands. While we have to look after the interests of our clients, if someone like the Friends of Loch Lomond could make the purchase, we would be extremely happy.' </p> <p>But Hannah Stirling warned: 'Even if the new owners cut down just one ancient tree, it can never be put back and the islands will be scarred forever.'</p>",
  "Men cost this country a fortune. Take the money wasted locking us up, for example - men make up 95 per cent of the prison population. Take the poor return on outlay for our education. Not only do girls increasingly outperform us in exams, but four out of five excluded pupils are boys. Take the havoc we wreak on the roads. We cause 94 per cent of road accidents, including nine out of 10 road deaths. There is more, but before we start arguing for a tax on men, there's one area in which we're saving the nation a packet - pensions. The life of the average man is shorter than that of the average woman by five years. And between the richest women and the poorest men the gap is wider still - more than 10 years. <p>The reasons have little to do with biology. Before the industrial revolution, the risks involved in childbirth meant that women generally died younger than men. Since then, though, the picture has changed, and statistics show that today men are more likely than women to die from cancer, heart disease, HIV infection, accidents and suicide. It's perhaps surprising, then, that 'men's health' as an area of investigation has only very recently come into its own. </p> <p>'Ten years ago, nobody was interested,' says Dr Ian Banks, chair of the Men's Health Forum (MHF). 'Politicians wouldn't talk about men's health for fear of being labelled anti-women, and we had similar problems within the British Medical Association.' </p> <p>Banks also says that health campaigns have overtargeted women - a problem that the government's minister for public health, Yvette Cooper, has asked the new Health Development Agency, responsible for health promotion, to address. In March of this year, the organisation's first conference on the needs of young men took place and the HDA's national advisor on young people, Sally Taylorson, says that 'for the first time, we're specifically building men's needs into what we're doing'. </p> <p>The true extent of gender health inequalities was not fully appreciated, even within the medical profession, until a wake-up call in 1992, when the then chief medical officer, Kenneth Calman, drew attention to male mortality data in his annual report. Since then, attitudes at policy level have steadily started to change. Earlier this year, Cooper commented on 'the biggest health inequality - that between men and women', and when the MHF launches its own website on 10 October, Cooper will be cutting the virtual tape. Banks feels that the increased level of political interest owes much to individuals like Cooper and her predecessor Tessa Jowell, but also to the women's movement. 'The success of action by women to address inequalities in their lives has made it easier for us to talk about the inequalities in ours.' </p> <p>It is not that men aren't interested in health issues - you only have to listen to them discussing Darren Anderton's latest injury to realise this - more that traditional health-promotion methods and messages are not reaching them. Men take more chances with their health and, when things do go wrong, they're less inclined to do anything about it. Men are more likely to drink too much, to smoke, to be overweight, to use illegal drugs and to take risks when sunbathing, driving or doing pretty much anything. Despite this, they are much less likely to consult a doctor. On average, men go to an NHS GP four times a year compared with women's six visits. </p> <p>'When men do use the NHS, they don't do it properly,' says Trefor Lloyd, who, through the organisation Working With Men, has been helping young men confront issues around masculinity and men's health for 17 years. 'Rather than go to their GP, they're more likely to turn up at casualty or to wait until things get serious. This is obviously inappropriate for them and expensive for the NHS. So there are good economic as well as equal-opportunity arguments for getting men to deal with health issues effectively.' </p> <p>Taking risks and ignoring the results are two sides of the same macho coin. The problem, Lloyd says, lies in the way men are brought up. 'Men are supposed to tough it out. A superhero like Rambo doesn't go to the doctor's, he stitches himself up. Men feel they are expected to cope on their own.' </p> <p>Lessons in being strong and silent have been absorbed by all males - both patients and doctors. 'A consultation between a woman GP and a woman patient will last four times as long as one between a male doctor and a male patient,' says Lloyd. 'Because men don't use the system, primary healthcare doesn't have the experience to cope with them when they do. It can easily misread what men are saying to them.' </p> <p>Lloyd welcomes any initiatives taken to target men about their health, but is wary of approaches that just trawl for men wherever they can be found without evaluating effectiveness. 'Sport and the internet are sometimes seen to be the answer to everything, because there are a lot of men involved in both,' he says. 'But the number of hits on a website, or number of leaflets given out at a football match are no indication of a campaign's success, any more than the number of articles in the press is. If I'm at a match, I'm more interested in the game than prostate cancer, and just because you log on to a site doesn't mean you do anything about it.' </p> <p>Used inappropriately, the internet could do more harm than good. 'Talking in a chatroom may help in the short term,' says Lloyd, 'but in the long term it is compounding the real problem, which is about problems with communicating with real people, the very reason men don't go to their GP in the first place.' </p> <p>Launching alongside the Men's Health Forum website, which is targeted mainly at the increasing number of health and other professionals taking an interest in the subject, will be malehealth.co.uk, a site aimed at men themselves. Editor Peter Baker describes it as 'the first comprehensive in-depth health website for men in the UK and possibly the world'. He feels there's a need to think about men's health in the broadest sense possible. He feels, for example, that the obsession in some men's health writing with the gymnasium and the 'six-pack stomach' does nothing to address the state of mind that makes men reluctant to seek healthcare. 'There's nothing wrong with physical fitness,' he says, 'but the idea that you need a certain body shape to be healthy is daft. It's not good for men's mental health. It increases self-consciousness about body image and sets a standard that is unattainable for most men.' </p> <p>Unattainable and irrelevant. Low income, poor diet, poor air quality, poor housing, inadequate access to services and education - all have a massive impact on health which jogging and press-ups will do little to offset. Of course, these social and environmental factors affect some people more than others and the global mortality figures mask stark class differences. While the mortality gap between men and women is finally narrowing among higher-income groups, it is still widening among those on lower incomes. Life expectancy for a man in social classes 4 and 5 is under 70; for a woman in social classes 1 and 2, it is over 80. </p> <p>Banks wants a more holistic approach. 'Because the Tories saw health as an individual responsibility, public health went down the tubes,' he says. 'It's made such a difference that we can start talking about inequality and social problems again. Even apparently individual problems like smoking have a social dimension - just look at the social groups who tend to smoke. We're also realising that improving men's health will improve women's health, too. After all, women are suffering looking after their sick men.' </p> <p>This government is taking gender inequalities in health seriously and it is putting the causes firmly on the agenda. It has accepted that traditional health- promotion techniques have not reached men and it is looking to organisations such as the Men's Health Forum to help it find new ways. All this makes good political sense. As Ian Banks says: 'Politicians can see the opportunity to make a big impact on the figures with relatively little input.' </p> <p>The challenge will come when the easy things have been done and the gap is still there. Yes, we need to talk to men and yes, we need to persuade them to go to their GP. But once they're there, we need to make them better. Last month's \u00a34.2m injection into prostate-cancer research was a small step in the right direction. There will need to be more.</p> <p>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.Menshealthforum.org.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">Menshealthforum.org.uk</a>. launches on 10 October.

  "Arpad Toth lights yet another cigarette and slumps heavily into a padded swivel chair. On the other side of the sliding glass doors at the far end of the room, darkness is falling. Momentarily, he raises his head and gazes balefully out at his disappearing garden. It was all going to be so perfect. It was going to be Eden. Now his five-year-old son is buried out there. <p>'I used to carry around this cyanide and I'll tell you, there were times when I was seconds away from... it looked like sugar. Looked exactly like sugar. Here, do you want some? You can have as much as you like...'</p> <p>He's smiling with his mouth, but not with his eyes, and I'm struck by the contrast between the muffled detonation of a man's soul and the fireworks on the Paulsgrove Estate in Portsmouth this summer, where cars were burnt and houses sacked and children carried placards screeching 'KILL THE BASTARDS' and chanted, 'Sex case, sex case: hang 'em, hang 'em, hang 'em' in reference to the faceless paedophile who is presumed to have taken Sarah Payne from her family. These two scenes, seemingly a universe apart, are about the same thing. This has been the summer of the dead child.</p> <p>We're sitting in a park on the outskirts of Croydon on a sunny September morning. Thirty feet away, a dozen or so small children are being entertained by a clown. The air is light with laughter and mums smirk as they hover watchfully in the background.</p> <p>'She's one of the better entertainers,' says Dee Warner. 'The ones we've had recently have been pretty bad. Even the kids noticed.'</p> <p>A conversation with Warner can be unsettling. One of the children giggling at the clown is her five-year-old son, Harry, while four-month-old Ellie sleeps in her pram. Our attention moves seamlessly between them and the unspeakable horror that is an everyday part of their mother's life. She and her friend Lynn Costello run the organisation Mothers Against Murder and Aggression, and the stories she carries around with her are shocking.</p> <p>There's the pair of 15-year-old girls seized by a gang of boys, taken to a barn, raped and set alight, then trammelled and scattered by firefighters who had no idea they were there; the parents whose daughter was knifed by a jealous schoolmate, whose only son then committed suicide next to a note indicating that he wanted to be with his sister. The man whose 10-year-old son and wife were beaten to death with a sledgehammer the day after the boy's birthday. The children taken and murdered by paedophiles and 'care in the community' psychiatric patients.</p> <p>It's lurid, horrendous, frightening stuff, and the examples given here are far from the worst. Warner and Costello formed MAMAA after James Bulger was killed by two 10-year-olds in 1993. They didn't have specific aims then, they just wanted to channel the despair they felt at a child being obliterated by other children. Now they run a helpline for the parents of murder victims from Warner's scrupulously tidy ex-local authority house on the edge of a pleasant estate. They also campaign for victims' rights and harsher punishments for offenders and supported the Paulsgrove protesters. What I want to know is how she lives with all this horror. And why?</p> <p>'Yeah, my brother-in-law says I'm paranoid,' she begins. 'He says I act like someone hanging around on every street corner waiting to take your child away. But I mean, what was the chance of Sarah Payne having a row with her brother and walking off? Sophie Hook was in her own back garden. People say I shouldn't make Harry so aware, but I'm afraid he is. When we did all the campaigning around [convicted paedophile] Sidney Cooke coming out, if he saw a picture of Sidney Cooke, he'd say, \"That man's really horrible and if you see him you should shout and shout and don't go with him.\" My sister said, \"Oh, my God...\" But what if he does see him?</p> <p>'And the scary thing is that with the \"name and shame\" thing, I showed Harry the photographs and he said, \"They don't look horrible, Mummy.\" I said, \"Well, that's the trouble, Harry, they don't always look horrible.\" People tell us that not all paedophiles murder, but they murder childhoods.'</p> <p>This is certainly true, but as I walk to my car, two things are running through my head. The first is a conversation I'd had with a child psychologist, who told me that an excess of fear can destroy childhoods, too. The second concerns a set of statistics supplied by the Home Office, which show that the number of children under the age of 10 who are known to be killed by strangers is astonishingly small.</p> <p>In 1994, there were none, while 1995 and 1996 saw two each, and the figures have remained more or less constant since figures became available. Most children are murdered and/or abused by people they know, usually relatives. Anyone who seriously wants to protect children might like to consider abolishing the family. These facts have been widely reported: we're aware of them, but it doesn't appear to help. My suspicion is that this is because, on the whole, we don't want it to.</p> <p>The fact is that something like 12,000 children under the age of 19 die each year. And nightmarish though Sidney Cooke is, even he can't match that. In this context, monsters become a soothing chimera, because monsters can be avoided, if we're good: the random horror of the world cannot. The problem is that the stories which have transfixed us this summer have had the effect of making child death seem at once palpitatingly present, yet also distant, freakish, unreal, little more than another opportunity for collective catharsis. Will Barbie be evicted from Big Brother ? Will the abducted girl die? These national cliffhangers are received in the same way, through the same media, and our collective responses look remarkably similar.</p> <p>The horror is increased, while the suffering is distanced. As one expert at London's Great Ormond Street Hospital scowled when asked to consider the idea that death is at least being brought out into the open: 'Yes, but if faced with a reality that's in danger of becoming too personalised, people still run a mile. The reality is as difficult as it ever was.'</p> <p>What follows is something of that reality.</p> <p>I'd heard and read a lot about Arpad Toth and his remarkable battle with the General Medical Council (GMC) following the unnecessary death of his son, but the man stalking across the drive to meet me was not what I'd expected. He is stocky and initially wary, a little spiky and nervous, prone to launch into lectures -almost any subject will do - at moments of discomfort. He built this drive, and the country house it leads to, and the stables and professional recording studio which take up most of the ground floor. Like a lot of perfectionists, he dresses his vulnerability with rigour, layers and layers of rigour - but a boy-like intensity radiates from his bleached-blue eyes and there is an agile, oppositional caste to his mind that is seldom less than entertaining. I found myself liking him very much. What I'd been told was true. You don't forget having met Toth.</p> <p>Now 47, his earliest memory is of watching tanks roll through the streets of Budapest from the balcony of his mother's apartment block. They escaped to England, where his mother married a fellow refugee, an art dealer. Arpad trained as an electrical engineer and worked as a technician at Oxford University before coming here. Eric Clapton and Radiohead recorded in the studio he built, and everything was progressing according to plan until his girlfriend informed him that she was pregnant. He was furious until his son, Wilfred, arrived, then fell in love in the hopeless, bewildered way that reluctant fathers often do.</p> <p>His boy was healthy, but had a congenital illness, a condition Toth describes as the inverse of diabetes, which meant that his body was capable of manufacturing and storing glucose in the liver, but couldn't retrieve it. The brain runs on glucose, so care had to be taken to ensure that Wilfred was given small but frequent feeds of carbohydrate or sugar. There had to be enough for his needs, but not so much as to burden the liver with excess supplies. It was a delicate balance to strike.</p> <p>The difficulty came at night, when the only way to regulate Wilfred's glucose intake was through a naso-gastric tube attached to a peristaltic pump. The system worked, but the pump had a serious design flaw in that once it had been set and the start button pressed, the only clear way to establish that it was working was to watch it for a period of time. Toth claims to have been close to finding a more reliable way of administering the glucose his son needed, when, on the morning of 9 October 1993, everything went wrong.</p> <p>Grimly but evenly, Toth describes the crisis which engulfed his family. That night, Wilfred's mother, a senior nurse who was six months pregnant with a second child, laid him in his usual place, between the spaces she and her husband would occupy in bed. She armed the pump and pressed the start button, but that night it didn't come on. Arpad came to bed early for him, at 2.30am, and watched satellite news, as was his habit, until he fell asleep. She rose early and fixed herself some coffee and was sitting up watching TV and reading the papers when Wilfred went into a violent hypoglycaemic fit. She woke her partner. According to them, it was now about 7.15am. They called their doctor's surgery and gave the boy some powdered glucose, which appeared to have no effect. What he needed was intravenous glucose.</p> <p>In their version, the doctor took an age to reach this very serious situation, then refused to administer the intravenous solution, instead offering barbiturates to control the fitting. Toth blames himself for his 'moment of doubt', during which he briefly lacked the confidence to insist that he knew better than a doctor who was about to do the wrong thing. Eventually, the GP called the local hospital in order to have Wilfred admitted 'for observation', then left. By the time the family arrived, manic and terrified, the brain damage caused by Wilfred's starvation of glucose was irreparable, and he never recovered from his coma. Toth turned off the life-support machine a week later, and the boy died in his arms.</p> <p>He took his complaint against his GP to the GMC and it was thrown out at the first hurdle, though if they'd known who they were dealing with, they might have reconsidered their haste. In the meantime, in his grief he refused to relinquish Wilfred to anyone. He took him home, called his friends round and they dug a huge hole in the frozen, wintry garden and plastered the walls and carpeted the floor until it looked like a scaled-down version of his son's room, Thomas the Tank Engine bed and all. One night, his partner came home and found the distraught Toth out there with a shovel, trying to rejoin his boy. When a daughter was born eight weeks later, in the same room in the same hospital as Wilfred, and a few doors away from the place where he died, her father could barely bring himself to acknowledge her presence.</p> <p>He blamed the doctor, his partner, himself, the universe. If there was still any kind of plot, he lost it, just wanted to exchange his grief for nothingness. He speaks of those early years with a kind of eerie detachment.</p> <p>'I think the only thing that stopped me from ending it then was that I thought, \"Christ, if I do this, I'll be betraying my son's memory.\" I gave in. I couldn't stand up to the powers that be. Then you think, \"Well, even if I make this statement, who would care? If they didn't care when my boy died, why the hell would they care when I die?\" So at times like that, I just went, \"Fuck it, I'm going to make a difference.\" And having suffered the ultimate insult, there's not a hell of a lot they can do to me any more, but there's a hell of a lot I can do in return.'</p> <p>I'd asked Arpad Toth whether he'd had anyone to confide in about all this. He'd replied that, no, he didn't; he'd felt alone, isolated, cut adrift from the rest of humanity. This is something you'll hear other parents say and which I caught a glimpse of on the train down to the Demelza House Children's Hospice in Sittingbourne, Kent.</p> <p>I was reading a leaflet giving details of an intense-sounding weekend course aimed at helping children come to terms with the death of relatives. At the end of it were some comments from participants and their guardians. One ran: 'My child was surprised to find other children in the same situation. When he told his story, he was really amazed that the other children did not laugh.' I must have appeared troubled by this, because I looked up to find the girl sitting next to me shifting her gaze uncomfortably and the woman opposite doing likewise. They'd seen what I was reading. They thought I'd lost a child - at least that's what I thought they thought - and a voice deep inside me wanted to say, 'No. No, I haven't. I'm OK. I'm like you.'</p> <p>I'm OK? And then I knew: we're afraid of people in this situation. We don't know what to say and fear the bleak force of the emotions involved, as though, in allowing them to enter us, we might conjure them into reality. If we infantilised inhabitants of the 21st century only relate to things we can identify with, the converse is also true: if we don't want to be identified with something, we shun it.</p> <p>Demelza House is a joyous place, with verdant grounds and everything a child with a terminal illness needs in order to be the careless scamp they deserve to be at this stage of life. Yet if you ask the staff how their jobs are perceived outside of their immediate environment, you will hear the same thing again and again. 'People either seem to see us as angels or lunatics,' says administrator Liz Johnson. 'And the effect on strangers when you tell them what you do can be astonishing. Conversations just stop. It's as though you've just told them you have leprosy. We tend to stick quite close to each other around here.'</p> <p>Staff on the Child Death Helpline at Great Ormond Street will tell you that people they call simply don't hear the word 'death' in their title. They hear 'deaf' or 'deer' or 'deb', or simply nothing at all ('Child wha'?') - anything but the reality. The few who do hear tend to gasp and try to get off the phone. The line has been going for five years, is staffed mostly by volunteers who've lost children and if you really want to know what the reality of the experience is, this is the place to visit.</p> <p>Anna, a volunteer, lost a 14-year-old son to leukaemia.'Most of us go through life assuming this will happen to someone else, and not beginning to understand what it's like. People feel huge sympathy, but just don't know what to say. Unfortunately, I think that one of the things which has come from all the reporting of children dying is that people suddenly become authorities on it and will try to demonstrate this to you, that they understand what you're going through. But they don't, they can't. And then in a month or so, they'll say, \"I expect you're feeling better now.\" People can get carried away on the wave of the feeling, or what they think this feeling is, and all these publicised tragedies have encouraged people to think that this is their way of being a part of that, you know. And they have no idea. You find yourself thinking, \"Why are you doing this? Just go about your business, maybe say a little prayer and be thankful it's not you...\"'</p> <p>So what does she say?</p> <p>'When you get a first-time caller and you're suddenly faced with this thing that has happened, my stomach immediately goes and the only thing I can say is, \"I'm just so sorry.\" Because I am. Just so sorry. People, I think, do find it hard to say that. It sounds trite, but sometimes it's all you can say.'</p> <p>Anna and her colleagues all talk of the isolation, the guilt, the blame, the anger, the fear for their other children and the loss of trust in the world, the complete loss of confidence, broken relationships, sense of helplessness and failure; the way you try to protect other members of your family and compensate for friends' discomfort, and the pressure this puts on you. The anniversaries, the pain when other children or grandchildren reach and pass the age at which yours died. The fact that your child, to one degree or another, had to make their final journey on their own. If the death was violent, there may be elements of post-traumatic stress - flashbacks, nightmares, imaginings of the fear the child might have felt. You never 'get over it', and there is no resolution. All you can do is learn to accommodate the loss, says coordinator Jean Simmons. The old five-stage models of grief, which purport to culminate in some sort of transcendence, she adds, are a waste of time.</p> <p>'We don't find those old linear models, in which you help people through certain stages until they can let go and resolve, helpful. We think it's more about holding on, finding ways to incorporate the loved person into your everyday existence, to recognise how they changed you and the influence they continue to have on your life and relationships.</p> <p>'Here, they won't be pathologised. The death of a child is special because, fortunately, not many will experience it. Nevertheless, there is a fear of bereaved people in society, which is strange, because it will happen to everybody at some stage, yet we treat it as if it were a pox. I think that's why they tend to be rushed off to counsellors. The pain is dealt with as an individual psychological response, but this is not something that's gone wrong with the bereaved individual - their response is normal and natural. The problem, often, is around them.'</p> <p>I wanted someone to tell me that the pain ends and things are all right in the end, but I'm not hearing that. No wonder we're scared of this stuff.</p> <p>Toth didn't believe in counselling either. Chain-smoking in his studio late into the night, he veers between sounding like Hamlet and General Patten as he describes his seven-year journey to here. Everything has changed. His relationship with his partner and daughter never recovered, for a start.</p> <p>'I suppose we never quite came back to each other,' he says quietly. 'Something's changed - I can't put my finger on it. And every time I look at my son's picture, I think, \"Christ, here we are seven years on, and I haven't achieved anything yet.\" I mean, I've achieved this, but it's still not enough.'</p> <p>By 'this', Toth means a famous victory he has just won over the GMC in the High Court, which could have far-reaching consequences for many, many people. According to his lawyer, Lee Ranford of Russell-Cooke Potter &amp; Chapman, 98 per cent of complaints brought to the GMC have hitherto failed, with an astonishing 90 per cent being rejected at the initial 'screening' stage. Now the organisation, whose motto is 'protecting patients, guiding doctors' ('We think it's been the reverse up to now,' says Ranford), has to have 'compelling reasons' for throwing out a complaint at this first stage, and must justify its decision, disclosing the evidence used to reach it. Toth has dozens of legal binders from the actions he has 'been forced' to bring against a range of parties.</p> <p>He appears to have been treated badly and can now re-animate his complaint against the GP involved in his son's case. He thinks that the same is true for many thousands of previous complainants and that, if even some of them make use of this new opportunity, the GMC would not be able to cope and would have to be replaced by an official body that could. Undeniably, this is an extraordinary thing that Toth has done, and there would appear to be plenty more to come.</p> <p>But what happens when the legal distractions are over and Arpad is just left with Arpad? I have to ask the question four times before he will give an answer that doesn't involve proceedings of some kind.</p> <p>'Well... it's something for me to do, isn't it. What I really like doing, what I've done all my life, is... I like inventing things. I like writing my music. I like doing my gardening. I don't really need to socialise. I'm quite happy with my own company and just dipping in and out of society as I need to. And I'd like a peaceful life. I don't want to be in strife all the time. But I find that nobody else is doing it. Nobody else is saying, \"I'm there for you.\"'</p> <p>Does the pain ever lessen?</p> <p>'No. Not really. You have flashbacks. You have dreams. You wish you could turn the clock back. If only I did something different. If only I didn't have that moment of doubt. It's a constant source of torment. You're faced with these people telling you they know and eventually you think, \"Maybe I am being hysterical, overreacting, losing my marbles,\" and eventually you cave in. And of course, death comes almost instantaneously and then you realise, \"Oh my God, I can't change my mind. In the space of one or two seconds, everything went, and there's no turning back.\" And even now I wake up in the middle of the night and say, \"Oh, he's here! Oh no, fucking hell, he ain't. It was a dream.\"</p> <p>'To lose a child is worse than losing a parent. It's unnatural, especially when it was avoidable. So you can't even inure yourself to the possibility, because the thought is too horrendous. So I think what'll probably happen is that this'll never finish. Even when the case against the doctor is concluded, I think that probably my path is set. I will always be there for the underdog. To try and change the system. Maybe one day I might even do something that will make it a bit more fair.'</p> <p>Arpad is slowing. I'm watching him dissolve like a snowman in the rain. 'You know, occasionally, when one of the animals died - a cat or a sheep - he made me promise that I would never die. Silly little thing. Then it turns out...'</p> <p>I'm wondering what to take from all this as I leave the Child Death Helpline offices and cross the road for a tour of Great Ormond Street Hospital. Like Demelza House, it is a buoyant, optimistic place, where thousands of children are being helped, cured, made more comfortable. Even here, though, the range of emotion you encounter makes your head swim. The horror is never far away. Outside, I'd passed a man and woman standing, he with his arms around her, each staring into some cruel and private distance, simply looking stranded.</p> <p>In the chapel, a big book where people can set down thoughts or prayers contained many entries along the lines of 'Please help me through my op. Charlotte, age 7' and 'Please help my friend Lynn.' One mother wrote a daily account of how her daughter's operations were going and you could feel her mood swing from hope to desperation to relief to anxiety, her girl's pain playing her like a game of poker. The entry that followed me home, though, simply read: 'Lord hear our cries and have mercy on my son. Please keep him safe in your arms forever.'</p> <p>Then, in the cancer ward, the revelation, as I watched a little girl of six or seven struggle through a door with a mobile drip which was so much bigger than she, then wrestle it grimly down the corridor. She'd lost her hair, presumably as a consequence of chemotherapy, and her face was misshapen, distended, with harrowed eyes wide with determination. You looked at her and your only possible thought was, 'This is not right. It shouldn't be happening,' at which point you either burst into tears or pull your jacket over your head, crouch to the floor and hop around like Basil Fawlty impersonating a frog. Neither, it is fair to assume, would be of much help.</p> <p>The thing is, we expect to be able to protect our children. We lead them to believe that we will, and in the main we do, but their childhood ends the day we no longer can, or will, and so does any echo of our own. In the adult world, joy tends to be anticipated, where horror drops out of the sky. We want the opposite for kids, for horror to be seen in advance and susceptible to control, while joy just happens. And we can't have that.</p> <p>Jean Simmons had told me that one of the most agonising decisions parents face when a child dies is what to dress them in for the funeral. 'They nearly always talk about dressing the child warmly,' she said. 'They're afraid they'll be cold.' And then it struck me that we're only here on loan to our children, and they to us.</p> <p>And that all the horror I've seen and been told about only has force because it corresponds to love. I decided to go home and take the kids to the park and hand this article in late.</p>",
  "<p>Homeowners face a tenfold increase in the risk of flooding and other weather- related damage to their property, the Environment Agency is warning. </p> <p>The Government body launched a new flood warning system last week with the prediction that Britain could become a flood 'hot spot', with 5 million people already living in flood risk areas. The agency says changing UK climate patterns will result in a 10 per cent increase in annual rainfall, wetter winters and more summer storms - all of which could cause flooding. </p> <p>Chairman Sir John Harman said: 'Flood risk is now a fact of daily life. Reports of flooding are now on average nearly twice as frequent as they were 100 years ago. More worryingly, with climate change, we could see up to a tenfold increase inrisk over the next century.' </p> <p>Even if your home has never previously been affected, there is no guarantee that you will remain safe. Last year, only one in eight people whose homes were flooded had experienced anything like it before. The agency fears that Government plans to build 23 million new homes in the next 15 years could exacerbate the problem. It is working with the Department of the Environment, Transport and Regions to introduce tougher guidance for plan ning authorities to curb development in flood plains. </p> <p>Properties with 'river frontage', 'lake' or 'sea views' are in great demand, yet they are particularly at risk. </p> <p>Harman warns: 'Flood risk will not automatically be included in the property search when you are buying a new home. You must request it from your solicitor or do your own homework.' </p> <p>You can ring the agency's new Floodline on 0845 988 1188, or request a personal call-back by clicking the 'phone-me' option on its website, <a href=\"http://www.environmentagency.gov.uk\">www.environmentagency.gov.uk</a> to find out if your home is at risk. It also offers practical hints on how to minimise the financial and emotional impact of a flood. </p> <p>Portsmouth residents had first-hand experience of the new warning system last week. Torrential downpours and the breakdown of a local pumping station sent a tide of raw sewage pouring through 115 homes. The damage will take months, if not years, to repair fully. </p> <p>So what can you do to protect yourself and your property? The first step is to make sure you have adequate home and contents insurance. The Association of British Insurers says nearly 40 per cent of UK homes have no buildings insurance, and 25 per cent of homes at risk of flooding have no contents cover. </p> <p>Paul Charles of online broker Screentrade says even those who have cover may find they are under-insured: 'Flooding is classed as a \"standard peril\", and all buildings and contents poli cies include it, but you don't want to guess that your contents are worth \u00a320,000 when they are actually worth \u00a340,000.' The average claim for flood damage is \u00a36,000 to \u00a37,000. </p> <p>If your home has been flooded before, you may find your insurance premiums are raised, but don't be tempted to mislead the insurance company. </p> <p>Charles says: 'Insurers check the information you give them with your previous insurer, and they will discover if you try to conceal a previous claim. If you are found out, your policy could become null and void.' </p> <p>It is a good idea to make a record of the damage done to your home as soon as possible. Make a video or take photographs while the water is still inside, if possible. </p> <p>Some policies provide immediate assistance for flood victims. However to ensure that you can contact your insurer quickly, Charles recommends keeping your policy documents (and all other important documents, passports and valuables) on the first floor or higher. </p> <p>Many victims say the worst aspects of flooding come during the recovery period. After the flood, it's vital to clean the property as soon as possible to minimise problems caused by damp. The longer a home spends under water, the greater the damage to its fabric.</p> <p><strong>'The dog barked, then we were walking in water' </strong></p> <p>John and Jeanette Taylor have been flooded twice in the past two weeks. Although they live on the Ridge - which is high up, as its name suggests - in Hastings, they suffered from overflowing drains two Fridays running. </p> <p>'The first time we were asleep in bed, and the dog woke us up by barking. My wife got out of bed and found she was walking in water,' says John.</p> <p>The second time, after it had rained heavily for 10 minutes, water started coming in under the door.</p> <p>'There was very little warning,' John says.</p> <p>On both occasions, sudden thunderstorms sent water flooding through their roof and overwhelmed both their mains drainage - only 4in in diameter - and the sewerage system, which are just outside the couple's front door. Luckily the house has an upside-down design, with the bedrooms on the ground floor and the living room and kitchen on the first floor. This meant that their documents and valuables were safe on the first floor.</p> <p>However, the flooding has ruined the Taylors' downstairs carpet, their wiring and the decoration in their bathroom.</p> <p>Eagle Star, their contents insurer, has arranged for a company to start work on drying out the house. Although the couple have not yet received estimates of how much the repair work will cost, John expects a replacement carpet alone to cost about \u00a3500.</p> <p>He also believes work will be needed to widen the drainage system to prevent future flooding.</p> <p><strong>How to stay safe </strong></p> <p>You can't prevent flooding, but you can be ready. The Environment Agency suggests these steps:</p> <p>\u0095 Check with the agency's Floodline, on 0845 988 1188, whether your property is at risk and ask about local warning arrangements.<br> \u0095 Keep a list of useful numbers: your council, emergency services, insurance company and Floodline.<br> \u0095 Find out where to turn off your gas and electricity. If you are unsure, ask the person who checks your meter when they next visit.<br> \u0095 Make up a flood kit, including a torch, blankets, waterproof clothing, wellington boots, a portable radio, first aid kit, rubber gloves and key personal documents. Keep it upstairs if possible.<br> \u0095 Buy a few sandbags or floor boards to block doors and airbricks, but ensure there is still adequate ventilation.<br> \u0095 Get into the habit of storing valuables upstairs.</p> <p>When you hear a flood warning:</p> <p>\u0095 Move people, pets and valuables upstairs or to higher ground.<br> \u0095 Drive your car to higher ground. It would take only 2ft of fast-flowing water to wash it away.<br> \u0095 Check on your neighbours - do they need help?<br> \u0095 Keep warm and dry. A flood can last longer than you think, and it can get cold. Take warm clothes and blankets, a Thermos and food.<br> \u0095 Make sure you have any medication you need to take regularly.<br> \u0095 Don't walk in floodwater above knee level. It can easily knock you over, and may hide hazards.</p> <p>After the deluge:</p> <p>\u0095 Call your insurance company and report what has happened.<br> \u0095 Check Yellow Pages under Flood Damage for cleaning materials or equipment to dry out your house.<br> \u0095 Check drainage systems.<br> \u0095 Ask gas, electricity and water companies to check your supplies before you turn them back on.<br> \u0095 Open doors and windows to ventilate your home. A brick dries out at the rate of an inch a month. Unblock airbricks and doorways.<br> \u0095 Wash taps and run them for a few minutes before use.<br> \u0095 Remove wet carpets and furniture.<br> \u0095 Don't touch items that have been in contact with the water, which may may be contaminated and contain sewage. Disinfect and clean thoroughly everything that got wet.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Bright at the end of the tunnel</strong><br> </p> <p>Now the firm has cast off its 'Dial-a-dog' label, perhaps it is finally time to take a serious look at Bright Station, entrepreneur Dan Wagner's latest reincarnation. </p> <p>Wagner's firm Dialog sold off its troublesome Knight Ridder database arm for \u00a3190 million before changing its name in May. Shorn of its debt, Bright Station has \u00a330m to invest in its remaining ventures. </p> <p>The main activity now is Smartlogik, an Autonomy in the making, which combines the firm's Muscat and Infosort data search and indexing technology for the internet and company intranets. It has been starved of investment, but now has a motivated new chief executive, Stephen Hill. </p> <p>Bright Station also emerged as the surprise buyer for Boo.com's website technology, which has beefed up its Sparza e-commerce arm. The firm paid \u00a3250,000 for Boo's platform but Wagner also picked up \u00a34m of computer kit for about \u00a31m. </p> <p>Wagner remains a deal-maker at heart. Given his record of promising much and delivering far less, even at 54p Bright Station shares are a leap of faith. But if he can hide under a bushel and quietly notch up a few sales, it may now be worth a punt. </p> <p><strong> Vimto's new fizz</strong><br> </p> <p>Nichols, the maker of Vimto, has had a miserable summer despite delivering interim results bang in line with expectations. The shares, now at 102p, have slipped from nearly 125p in June. House broker Henry Cooke, however, believes the stock is a good recovery buy. </p> <p>The broker may well have a point. Demand for Vimto has been strong, supported by an increased marketing spend, and the new citrus Vimto has been well received. Going forward, reorganisation at Cabana drinks dispensing should cut costs, and capital expenditure at Nichols Foods should also bear fruit. The shares are trading at just six times prospective earnings, and are well-supported by a net yield of 9 per cent. </p> <p><strong> Bitter sweet</strong><br> </p> <p>At the opposite end of the spectrum, Cadbury Schweppes has shelled out a pretty penny for Snapple. At $1.45 billion, the price is nearly five times the amount Triarc paid to take it off Quaker Oats' hands. Quaker, of course, originally paid $1.7 billion in 1994, but made a complete bodge of the deal. Triarc has since turned the soft drinks maker around. </p> <p>Cadbury will always labour under concerns that it is competing with two of the strongest names around, Coca Cola and Pepsi. But the Snapple deal is earnings enhancing and shows Cadbury can still deliver growth. </p> <p>Broker Schroder Salomon Smith Barney has set a new target price of 480p for Cadbury shares, against just 394p now. </p> <p><strong> Fairey's magic</strong><br> </p> <p>Fairey, the engineering group, has amassed a tidy set of focused electronic and instrumentation businesses. And an upcoming analysts' visit to Fairey's hi-tech US operations in October should raise awareness of its exposure to growth sectors. </p> <p>Fairey's \u00a3170m buy of Spectris in July and the sale of Imaging Technology lift the critical mass of all its operating units. Sales are also up. </p> <p>Broker Charterhouse has now increased its profits forecast, and rates the shares, at 566p, a buy. </p> <p><strong> Glynwed simmers</strong><br> </p> <p>At 186p, Midlands engineer Glynwed is very firmly out of favour in a fashion-driven market. But keep the faith: Aga oven sales are accelerating, and plastic pipe systems offer prospects for expansion. Here Glynwed has just 8 per cent of an \u00a311bn global market. Buy for recovery.</p>",
  "<p>Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott will tomorrow launch a renewed crackdown on company directors who neglect health and safety regulations in their businesses. </p> <p>In the first of two speeches to Labour's conference in Brighton this week, Prescott will unveil a package of measures including harsher fines for safety breaches; a clearer definition of directors' responsibilities for health and safety; and measures to 'recycle' proceeds from financial penalties paid by directors and companies into strengthened regulation. An enhanced role for trade union safety representatives will also be included. </p> <p>Officials at the Department for the Environment, Transport and the Regions are also working with the Home Office to strengthen the role of the Director of Public Prosecutions in securing convictions for health and safety breaches, and are co-operating on Jack Straw's plans for a new charge of corporate manslaughter. </p> <p>Figures in the most recent Health and Safety Executive annual report indicate that fatal injuries at work fell from 274 in 1998 to 257 in 1999, and that there were falls of 5 per cent in major non-fatal accidents and those which kept people away from work for at least three days. </p> <p>However, trade unions have argued that not enough is being done to reduce these levels faster, and have mounted a high-profile campaign spotlighting the continuation of dangerous practices by many firms and the need for clearer and more effective regulations. </p> <p>Prescott believes that directors do not take health and safety issues seriously enough, and that the only way of focusing attention on the issue is to come down hard with a major review of fines and the introduction of new methods of preventing bad practice. </p> <p>The Government does not simply want to raise penalties; it wants to overhaul health and safety regulations. There are also plans to 'fast track' certain offences where there is a feeling that the directors are guilty of gross negligence. </p> <p>A government source said: 'We think the penalties for putting workers' safety at risk are not tough enough. In health and safety law the punishment does not fit the crime Higher fines are a certainty.' </p> <p>The measures will form part of a new Safety Bill which is likely to be put on to the legislative programme early in the next parliament if Labour wins the general election. Sources say the DETR is already pushing for early parliamentary time for such a bill. </p> <p>The Deputy Prime Ministers will also use his speech to announce that he will accept the conclusions of Lord Cullen's report into the Ladbroke Grove rail disaster when they emerge. </p> <p>The anniversary of the tragedy falls at the beginning of next month. Prescott will also outline in his speech a new series of targets aiming to reduce the numbers of deaths and serious injuries in road accidents. </p> <p>'As far as Cullen goes, without wanting to pre-empt anything, there is a full commitment to implementing what he comes up with at the end of his inquiry,' a Whitehall source said. </p> <p>Any of Cullen's recommendations which require primary legislation can go into the Safety Bill.</p>",
  "<b> The Queen of Spades</b> New Theatre, Cardiff <br> <b> Manon Lescaut/Poppea</b> English National Opera, Coliseum, London WC2 <p>Flair and confidence characterised Welsh National Opera's stunning new staging of <b> The Queen of Spades</b>. Once every few seasons, a production gets pretty much everything right. This is one. Musically first class, dramatically spine-chilling, visually spare and coherent, it was the kind of theatrical experience which changes the way you look at life - not a comment to be made lightly. </p> <p>Tchaikovsky's finest opera, for so it seemed here (until now, my money had been on Eugene Onegin), is also his most disturbing. The enthralling score blazes a trail forward to Stravinsky rather than illuminating the path back to Wagner or the lush romanticism with which Tchaikovsky's name is usually, and wrongly, synonymous. </p> <p>It made a difference that the work was conducted by a Russian still in his twenties, Vladimir Jurowski, whose reading of the score was fresh, cogent and free from old assumptions. Instead of a smudgy blurring of Tchaikovsky's surging orchestral lines, all was precision and detail. WNO's orchestra is one of the best and here was especially attentive. Jurowski is the new musical director of Glyndebourne, a shrewd appointment. </p> <p>Pushkin's novella of the same title, skilfully adapted by Tchaikovsky and his brother, charts the journey from flickering obsession to total madness of the young officer, Herman, a gambler. His love for Liza becomes corrupted by his all-consuming determination to learn the secret of three winning cards, known only to her grandmother, the countess. Richard Jones, who directed Covent Garden's recent Ring , goes from strength to strength, absorbing ideas rather than, as once seemed the case, sticking them on like flags. </p> <p>Action is updated to the 1940s. Imperial uniforms yield to drab Soviet grey, making the work more immediate, exchanging the debonair for the desolate. In the ball scene, the usual ballet was replaced by two tender rag-doll puppets. Dramatic effect meets budgetary restraint in a perfect solution to what often seems a dreary interlude. </p> <p>Repeatedly, Jones and his designer, John Macfarlane, showed their close consideration of action and movement. Blackouts at the end of scenes focus attention. Visual pairings abound - the table on which the puppets dance is echoed by the vast gaming table on which Herman's fate is played out; changing front cloths portray the countess as young girl or ravaged old woman, offering their own counterpoint to the story; Herman precipitously spies on his lover from a skylight which later lets him view his fellow gamblers at play. No thread is left loose. Two scenes in particular - of Herman in bed and and the countess in her bath - are too arresting to spoil by description. </p> <p>Theirs, too, is a conspicuously musical production, sometimes in a literal sense, as when Herman and two friends, seated on a bench, spring apart as if catapulted by the imperative roll of the timpani, but always in the freedom and support it offers the singers. </p> <p>The powerful Russian tenor Vitali Taraschenko played Herman as a properly troubled, repressed soul (the production hints at homoerotic undertones). In a strong and otherwise British cast singing in Russian, Susan Chilcott excelled as Liza. Next month, Susannah Glanville, an equally gifted performer, takes over the role. Susan Gorton as the voluptuously fading countess, Robert Hayward, Gary Magee and Emma Selway were outstanding. After Cardiff, WNO tours to Oxford, Southampton, Liverpool, Birmingham and Bristol. Take note. </p> <p>Puccini wrote <b> Manon Lescaut</b> in 1893, three years after The Queen of Spades. Whereas Tchaikovsky's heroine epitomises youthful innocence, Manon is a puzzling clash of submission and infamy, idealism and opportunism. Puccini struggled with the structure of the drama, as is all too evident in the bumpy unfolding of the story of her doomed love for des Grieux. </p> <p>ENO's new staging by Keith Warner, conducted by Paul Daniel, the first in an enigmatic season entitled Italian Opera, didn't entirely overcome the difficulties. Stafanos Lazaridis, designing all 10 operas, has created what the blurb calls a 'scaffolding environment' sympathetic to but not part of the restoration work now underway at the Coliseum. Decked out in magnificently decayed Hogarthian costumes and wigs, the cast added a certain sullied grandeur. </p> <p>But the action was confused, the endless clattering round walkways distracting in an already diffuse drama. It's hard enough to get a grip on the love trials of a couple who scarcely know each other (and here hardly looked at one another) without scattering the action round the entire auditorium. </p> <p>The translation put back the case for opera in English a few decades. It seemed to have little relation to Puccini's phrasing and even less to the stresses of the English language. Turning 'I' and 'beg' into words of two syllables is unacceptable. But these are primarily musical matters. Someone, somewhere should have had their ears open. </p> <p>The chorus and cast, led by Nina Stemme and Martin Thompson, did their best not to sound silly but were too often drowned out by the orchestra, the intonation and ragged ensemble of whose final chord suggested they were not entirely enamoured of the work. </p> <p>Matters improved with ENO's second new production, a racy, witty and explicit account of Monteverdi's <b> Poppea</b> by Steven Pimlott. Words, often very funny, were perfectly audible in Christopher Cowell's crisp translation. The duel between love and jealousy, desire and justice, which is played out in this baroque masterpiece took on a modern guise: modish leathers, ponytails (for the men) and a whip (for Octavia, a woman wronged) set the tone. </p> <p>The stylish cast was led by a luscious Alice Coote in the title role and the American countertenor David Walker as her body-beautiful Nero, with Michael Chance roaring round in high-heels and dress yet still managing to sing with his usual eloquence. Not much was left to the imagination, and a certain dignity was lost. </p> <p>In some circumstances, this would matter. Yet what on paper sounds dire and risky can in practice, as here, beguile. Opera's power to defy logic and cheat formula is one of life's enduring mysteries.</p>"
