  "<p> A study of an out-of-work Argentinian ex-musician may not sound the most promising material for a feature film, but first-time director Pablo Trapero has crafted an impressive debut - one that emphasises the dignity of his subject without lapsing into agit-prop. </p> <p>The central figure here is one Rulo (Luis Margani), nearing 50 and running to considerable fat. His wife is long gone, and he has lapsed into the unprepossessing lifestyle of the set-in-his-ways mid-lifer: washing up when he feels like it, clothes where he drops them, that sort of thing. Rulo is also saddled with an adolescent son, a none-too-trim specimen himself, fond of Sepultura and other metal outfits so popular in Latin America. </p> <p>Much of Rulo's time is spent attempting to find a job: he has a friend who works for a construction company, and so Rulo is given a crash course in how to operate one of those gigantic 300-foot cranes that tower over the city building sites. Reinforcing the irony of Rulo's hand-to-mouth predicament is the fact that his band (\"The Seventh Regiment\") briefly achieved stardom in the 70s - added to which, his son Claudio (Federico Esquerro) is knocking out a racket with a pick-up garage band of his own. </p> <p>Trapero's treatment of this blue-collar milieu is pleasantly straightforward and low-key: neither does he cast Rulo as an incarnation of working-class nobility (this guy is a serious slob, and kicks his son out when he gets too noisy), nor as a repository of society's ills - much of his misfortune, you sense, is due to his inability to focus properly, or pay attention to reasonably obvious warning signs. Trapero concentrates on Rulo's stolid bravery: when he loses out to a younger, fitter competitor for the crane job, his only option is to travel thousands of miles south to a building project in Patagonia - sacrificing a flourishing love affair as he does so - on a vague friend-of-a-friend promise. That he encounters genuine comradeship in a trying environment is almost incidental; the job comes to an end, and the work cycle grinds on remorselessly. </p> <p>Much has been made of Trapero's debt to neo-realism, and while the monochromatic visuals and thematic common ground with Bicycle Thieves are undoubtedly powerful, Crane World belongs to a much more stripped-down school of realism that is present in some strength at Edinburgh. </p> <p> Tonight and Saturday.

  "<p>As Patrick Vieira considers taking his most dramatic early exit yet, this time out of English football altogether, he may be heartened to hear that rivals, as well as team-mates, are insisting he should stay. </p> <p>This even includes Liverpool's Dietmar Hamann, the victim of the tackle that led to Vieira's second red card in three days at Highbury on Monday, who said: \"It would be bad for English football if he left. He is a fantastic player and not a dirty one. He plays the game in a fair-minded way.\" </p> <p>In any case, even if Vieira left Arsenal it is difficult to imagine where he could go in search of greater understanding, short of signing for the Priory Clinic XI. In Europe's main leagues a man of his combative instincts would be unlikely to complete 90 minutes of any game, and in Italy he would be lucky to survive the pre-match warm-up. </p> <p>Vieira understands that, which is central to his frustration, feeling forced out of his natural environment by referees he believes are singling him out. But though he has at times invited punishment, unnecessarily and even recklessly, he finds himself playing in England at a time when beleaguered referees are trying to second-guess the assessors and rule-tweakers who govern them. </p> <p>The English game is the fastest and most physical in the world, which used to invite a matching level of tolerance and discretion from officials who tried their best to distinguish between malevolent fouls and mistimed ones. Now those qualities have been reclassified as vices for referees who have been instructed, as they were at the beginning of last season, to take a zero-tolerance attitude to foul play. </p> <p>Vieira, who was sent off only once in each of the previous two seasons, made a serious attempt to temper his game after his red card against West Ham last October, when he received a six-match ban not for his tackle but for spitting at Neil Ruddock. </p> <p>To a degree he has even managed to temper his temper. And he was so confident that he could offer further proof that he was reformed this season that he struck a bet with his best friend Olivier Dacourt that he would have the better disciplinary record of the two of them. </p> <p>Dacourt, in Germany preparing for Leeds's Champions League qualifier against Munich 1860 tonight, says: \"I phoned Pat after the Sunderland game to tell him that he would never win the bet. He managed to joke then but he must be very upset now. </p> <p>\"When you watch the incident against Liverpool, can you tell me that he was not unlucky? I have not been able to speak to him yet but when he came off the pitch he told the people in French that he does not want to play in England any more. If he does stop playing, the Premiership will lose a great player.\" </p> <p>Though Dacourt could be expected to defend his friend, Vieira's case is significantly helped by the more independent support of Sunderland's manager Peter Reid and Liverpool's G\u00e9rard Houllier, who both insisted he was desperately unlucky. And though Hamann insists that the tackle on him deserved a yellow card, he rightly points out that Vieira should never have received his first booking, when he shaped to retaliate after a Jamie Carragher foul but was held back by team-mates. </p> <p>Vieira apologised to Arsenal colleagues after losing his head at Sunderland on Saturday when pulled back by Darren Williams. But though flailing an arm invited a red card, he clearly did so not with the intention of injuring an opponent but to free himself to continue an attack as his side chased a last-minute equaliser. </p> <p>This is not to build a case for Vieira's canonisation. In both games he lost emotional control, and history suggests there is almost no measurable unit of time between the lighting of the blue touchpaper by an opponent and the Vieira explosion. </p> <p>His expectorating performance against Ruddock, an unacceptable practice in British football, was an example of that. And as well as a sending-off against Charlton two years ago for elbowing an opponent, an unacceptable practice anywhere, he has been fined for making a V-sign to Sheffield Wednesday fans and he escaped punishment and, remarkably, retribution after appearing to butt Roy Keane last season. </p> <p>After six red cards, Vieira is one sending-off away from joining Vinnie Jones at the head of the Premiership dishonours list. Given the respective talent of the two players this seems a ludicrous prospect, though Vieira has already equalled Eric Cantona's record of red cards in successive games. Cantona's were against Swindon and, no surprise here, Arsenal in 1993-94. </p> <p>Despite a denial by Philip Don, the Premier League's head of refereeing, that there is a clampdown on foul play, a pattern has developed in English football in which a flurry of red cards in the opening weeks of the season becomes barely a trickle later on. By Christmas, the sort of tackle with which Vieira caught Hamann may not even bring a harsh look from a referee. Arsenal are just hoping he is still around to reap the benefit.</p>",
  "<p>The number of people sleeping rough in England has fallen by more than a third over the past two years, according to figures released yesterday by Louise Casey, the government's homelessness tsar. </p> <p>She told the prime minister that good progress was being made towards his target of bringing all rough sleepers in from the cold. But there was a huge amount more to do to help those addicted to a life of drugs and street crime - and to support vulnerable people who were in danger of becoming the next generation of down and outs. </p> <p>In a progress report to Tony Blair, Ms Casey's rough sleepers unit said there were now about 1,180 homeless people on the streets in England. That was 28% down on this time last year and a 36% reduction on the year before. </p> <p>The largest concentrations of rough sleepers continued to be in central London boroughs, with nearly a fifth of the national total being in Westminster. </p> <p>Oxford, Brighton, Nottingham, Birmingham, Manchester, Cambridge, Bournemouth and Bristol each had more than a score of rough sleepers, acording to latest estimates. </p> <p>They will be among 32 authorities outside London to benefit from an extra \u00a39.5m distributed yesterday by the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions as part of a \u00a3200m programme to reduce numbers of rough sleepers by at least two-thirds by 2002. </p> <p>Ms Casey said achievements so far included the appointment of teams in London and other big cities to make contact with rough sleepers and give them the help needed to \"come inside\". </p> <p>An extra 800 hostel bed spaces for vulnerable rough sleepers had been created in London, bringing the total to more than 2,000. There were also better services to combat drug misuse among rough sleepers and projects to help people leaving the streets to move on from hostel accommodation into training and work. </p> <p>Shaks Ghosh, chief executive of Crisis, a charity for the single homeless, said the progress report was an important first step. New bed spaces and services helped to reduce numbers sleeping rough, especially outside London. </p> <p>\"But I am worried about the numbers of people who are coming off the streets only to be warehoused in hostels, emergency shelters, and other temporary accommodation for months and even years.\" They needed support if they were to have a chance of rebuilding their lives. </p> <p>Crisis estimated there was a \"hidden homeless\" population of 400,000, including people in squats, bed and breakfast, and sleeping on friends' sofas. It said many were at risk of becoming the next wave of rough sleepers. </p> <p>Archie Norman, shadow environment secretary, said: \"This is a disgrace, not a triumph for New Labour. The government has promised \u00a3200m to tackle rough sleeping - \u00a3125,000 per rough sleeper. Yet even if they have managed to get 400 people off the streets, this is still less than the rise in homelessness.\" </p> <p>Figures provided to the Conservatives from the Commons library showed 27,050 were classified as priority homeless in the first quarter of 1997, compared with 27,700 in the first quarter of 2000.</p>",
  "<p>The BBC yesterday opened the way to a flotation of its commercial internet business after selling a 13.5% stake in the operation to a US venture capital firm for \u00a332.5m. </p> <p>The deals gives the business, comprising <a href=\"http://www.beeb.com\"> Beeb.com </a>and internet service provider <a href=\"http://www.Freebeeb.net\">Freebeeb.net</a>, a valuation of \u00a3240m. That is far lower than some previous estimates and reflects the change in sentiment about internet companies. </p> <p>Rupert Gavin, chief executive of BBC Worldwide, the commercial arm of the corporation, said the deal would provide the business with funds to expand while allowing the BBC to retain control. The US firm, TH Lee Global Internet Managers, will have two places on the board of the subsidiary, to be renamed Beeb Ventures. </p> <p>Investors were invited to come forward last year but Mr Gavin shrugged off the suggestion that the BBC could have achieved a better price had it clinched a deal before the reversal of internet fortunes in March. Cable company NTL and broadcaster Flextech also held talks with the BBC. </p> <p>\"In an uncertain market this is a very good valuation,\" he said. \"It is important that we are retaining the majority of the economic interest.\" </p> <p>Mr Gavin said all options would be considered when TH Lee looks to recoup its investment. The typical route for a venture capital firm is a stock market flotation within three to five years of an investment, a move that would need approval from the BBC's board of governors and the government. A flotation would draw claims of creeping privatisation. </p> <p>Beeb.com made revenues of \u00a32m last year, largely on the back of advertising. It has been putting a series of e-commerce partners in place which will be linked to programme websites. Users are, for instance, offered a CD shopping guide by clicking through to Beeb.com from a Top of the Pops site. </p> <p>Mr Gavin said there would be clear markers to make users realise they were leaving a public service site and entering a commercial one. </p> <p>Sharon Pipe, managing director of TH Lee, which has more than $1bn under management, said: \"There are few game-changing investment opportunities where you are getting involved with a company which will be the leader in its field. Beeb.com is probably one of them.\" </p> <p>The deal does not affect the corporation's public service internet operation which includes the award winning News Online and the recently launched Sport Online which are both licence fee-funded. </p> <p>One of the first signs of the new funding will be a \u00a37m advertising campaign for the online ventures from September.</p>",
  "<p>Data from top secret navy submarine missions under the North Pole holding vital clues to the nature and speed of global warming could end up lying unused because scientists have not been given the money to finish analysing it. </p> <p>In an unprecedented act of openness about one of its murkiest areas of operations, the Ministry of Defence has released sonar measurements of Arctic ice thickness taken by nuclear submarine crews during eight previously unreported polar voyages. The data was given this year to Peter Wadhams, of the Scott Polar Research Institute, in Cambridge, who has accompanied nuclear sub crews on other journeys below the Arctic ice.</p> <p>Together with data already analysed from US navy subs, the new figures would give climate experts a powerful tool to quantify the impact of man-made warming on the global environment. They expect to be able to confirm scientists' fears that, largely due to global warming, the ice pack is vanishing, and the Arctic basin could be completely ice-free in summer by 2050.</p> <p>But the government has given Dr Wadhams only half the money that he needs to turn the raw data into usable information.</p> <p>\"Up till now, instead of having data for every year, we've had gaps,\" Dr Wadhams said. \"So when we see a thinning of the ice it's possible for people to say that, in the missing years, it got thicker again.</p> <p>\"The results would be incredibly rewarding. We think they would confirm a steady downward trend in the thickness of the ice, rather than a cycle of thinning and thickening.\"</p> <p>When Dr Wadhams applied to the government body that gives out grants to scientists for climate work, the Natural Environment Research Council, he was told he could only have funding for 18 months of work - \u00a3102,000 - instead of the three years he asked for.</p> <p>\"The navy has been very helpful towards science,\" he said. \"There's been a wonder ful collaboration with them, and now it's extra wonderful because they have released data from previously classified voyages. The only problem is that we need funds to work the data up.\"</p> <p>Computer models of climate change forecast global warming happening faster in the Arctic than elsewhere in the world, making it a crucial laboratory. There are fears that, in a century's time, the Arctic melt will deflect the Gulf Stream short of the British Isles, making the UK significantly colder than it is now.</p> <p>\"It's vitally important, because the Arctic is showing us climate change at an accelerated rate, and it will have a marked impact on our own climate. NERC ought to view this as high priority, but it's very difficult for them to change their way of thinking,\" Dr Wadhams said.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for NERC said there was a lot of competition for grants, particularly in the field of climate change, and Dr Wadhams had also received a grant of \u00a3311,000 for another Arctic ice study.</p>",
  "<p>Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast said last night that it was facing a financial crisis, triggering expectations that hundreds more redundancies will be announced at a politically sensitive time. </p> <p>The yard recently lost a first round court case over a \u00a323m unpaid bill and has no large contracts left for its 1,000 workers. It is running up losses of \u00a32.5m a month being paid for by its Norwegian parent group Fred Olsen Energy. </p> <p>Harland and Wolff is one of the biggest employers in Northern Ireland and its problems come as the province faces increased violence and social instability. </p> <p>Yard officials blamed its precarious position on an American rig owner which is refusing to pay a \u00a323m instalment. A spokesman for the ship and rig builder said: \"Our company is in a critical financial position because of the actions of Global Marine in not paying for the second of two drillships we built for them.\" He refused to say whether further job losses were now inevitable on top of the cuts in the staff that were made earlier this summer. \"No decisions have yet been made,\" the spokesman said. But Peter Williamson, regional secretary for the AEEU union said: \"The situation is extremely serious. Substantial job losses are inevitable.\" He expects a board meeting of Fred Olsen Energy in Oslo to confirm redundancies. </p> <p>Fred Olsen, whose family is the major shareholder in Fred Olsen Energy, met union officials from the GMB and AEEU at the yard on Monday. Both sides expressed concern at the escalating problems facing a yard which has rarely made profits and has been riddled with problems since it was privatised in the 1980s. </p> <p>Nowegian industry analysts say Fred Olsen is becoming increasingly frustrated by the Belfast yard and is under pressure to sell it off. In July Fred Olsen Energy issued a profit warning saying Harland and Wolff would produce an \u00a38m net loss in the second quarter and 254 employees left the yard in June. Yard management hopes to firm up orders for four ferries worth \u00a3300m and has letters of intent for two cruise ships worth \u00a3200m. The yard is also battling to win roll-on roll-off ship orders from the MoD. </p> <p>A year-long legal tussle between Harland and Wolff and Global Marine came to a head two weeks ago when a High Court judge ruled the US company could remove the rig from the yard.</p>",
  "<p>Had there been anyone there to watch, they would have thought that some gigantic, terrible sea creature was trying to break through the ice. There, at the North Pole, on March 17, 1959, a wind-scoured expanse of flat snow and hummocks was being broken into from below. With an eerie lack of sound, a huge black shape burst through the ice and settled, long, featureless and menacing, in the wasteland. </p> <p>That was the day that Commander James Calvert and his men, the crew of the US nuclear submarine Skate, made history by being the first to test the thickness of the ice at the top of the world in the most dramatic way possible, with the hull of the boat they relied on to get them back home. </p> <p>Since then, scores of submarines, including many from Britain, have visited the pole this way. A long, sometimes anxious, often boring, cruise under the ice; the search for a way up: a crack in the ice, known as a lead, an area of open water - a polynya - or a stretch where the frozen layer between water and sky is thin enough to break; the call to action stations; and the careful easing of the vessel up to the surface, sometimes with heart-stopping sounds of cracking and straining as the ice yields. And then, for the Royal Navy at least, a spot of football at the pole. Or, as has been known, the best cricket playable in three layers of clothing and Arctic mittens. </p> <p>These cruises were for the sake of apocalyptic wars to come. The measuring of the thickness of the ice by sonar as the submarines hummed through the dark waters was just a by-product. But as scientists began to analyse the results of these measurements, they noticed a curious thing: year after year, the ice was becoming thinner. Amid fears of global warming, with the cold war gone, it starts to look as if the main legacy of those under-ice voyages will be the warning of a completely different apocalypse, equally man-made and equally destructive - the floods and famines of a world grilled under a blanket of greenhouse gases. </p> <p>Earlier this month, a group of American tourists were startled, when they reached the North Pole on board a Russian icebreaker, to find that there was no ice to break. The pole, in our imaginations a flat white sheet scoured by twisting lines of wind-blown snow, was open water. Gulls flew overhead. The nearest stretch of ice capable of bearing the weight of the tour party was six miles away. </p> <p>\"There was a sense of alarm,\" said Dr James McCarthy, an oceanographer and one of the tourists. \"Global warming was real, and we were seeing its effects for the first time that far north.\" </p> <p>Arctic specialists read fearful media accounts of the icebreaker tour with mixed feelings. On one hand, they knew that open water at the North Pole is not, in fact, unusual - as the repeated submarine surfacings there show. Even in winter, the winds which keep the ice constantly moving across the sea of the Arctic basin cause cracks, ridges and large polynyas to appear. The Skate surfaced in 1959 through a lead of open water which had recently frozen over. </p> <p>Yet they knew, too, that the tourists had witnessed something new - the thinness of the ice across the whole Arctic region, where historically it has been up to 3m thick. The evidence is mounting. The US Navy has provided its data, the Royal Navy has just released its last classified figures for analysis, and the Russians are rumoured to be preparing to put their information on the market. From 1300km up, satellites are able to measure ice thickness with incredible accuracy - to within 10cm. All the signs are that the sea ice over the Arctic is melting, and in 50 years' time, in summer, there could be no ice there at all. </p> <p>\"The average ice thickness in summer has decreased by 40% between the 1970s and now,\" said Peter Wadhams of the Cambridge-based Scott Polar Research Institute, who is a veteran of Arctic submarine voyages. \"That's a pretty major decrease. And we're looking at satellite images showing the area of ice to be shrinking too - that's been going down by 5% a decade. At that rate, it will have vanished in 50 years.\" </p> <p>An ice-free Arctic. Should we care? If all the sea ice melts, it won't affect sea levels: an ice cube melting in a drink does not make the drink overflow. Merchant ships would be able to cut almost 5,000 miles off the Europe-Japan sea route by zipping across the North Pole. Oil prospectors and trawlers would move in. Siberians and Canadians would cash in. But it would spell disaster for creatures such as the polar bear; it would mean the end of one of the world's last true wildernesses. And for humankind, it could be the beginning of a great climatic catastrophe. </p> <p>The North Pole has always inspired passion in scientists. The passion to get there first, and the passion to be right about what is happening in the remotest and most mysterious of places. The man long accepted as the first to have reached the pole, Robert Peary, turned out to have wanted the honour so passionately that he lied - it now seems likely that he never got closer than 100 miles from the pole. The first to make it was probably a Soviet airman, Ivan Papanin, and he didn't make it until 1937. </p> <p>The current debate about the causes of Arctic ice-thinning is, appropriately, one of the fiercest and most keenly watched in the whole field of climate change. Computer models of the world's climate predict that if changes take place, they will take place in the Arctic earlier and faster than anywhere else on the planet. The question under dispute is simple: is global warming to blame for the watery pole, or is it part of a separate weather cycle, whereby the ice shrinks and thickens in a regular way over decades? </p> <p>Johnny Johannessen, of the Nansen Environmental and Remote Sensing Centre in Bergen, Norway - where scientists have predicted the demise of the Arctic summer sea ice in 50 years - said: \"It's a challenge to be able to pin down how much ice thickness is changing as a result of global warming and how much is due to atmospheric conditions which, we know, undergo huge changes in the Arctic from decade to decade.\" </p> <p>Dr Wadhams said he was convinced that global warming was the cause. In particular, the ice was being undermined from below by warmer seas. The idea that a change in the winds which shift the sea ice would simply \"flip\" the cycle back to a rethickening of the ice was, he said, unconvincing. \"The balance of probability is that this is a real global-warming effect. It's not going to go back.\" </p> <p>If global warming really is found to be responsible for the melting of the Arctic, it has two sets of consequences - one direct, the other demonstrative. If scientists can point to a shrinking skein of ice floes where valiant explorers once walked with huskies, it will help them to wake up the world to the powerful changes that man-made climate change is capable of making to all our lives. </p> <p>Directly, the disappearance of the shiny white ice at the pole means the loss, for the planet, of a huge reflector, beaming the sun's heat back at it. Open water is darker and absorbs heat better. In other words, the loss of the ice would add to the rise in global temperatures. </p> <p>Another direct consequence is a particularly ugly one for Britain. Global warming is predicted to mean steadily rising temperatures for our islands, bringing Mediterranean balm to the south. But within 100 years, this could change. With the melting of the Arctic ice, some models say, the existing circulation of cold and hot, fresh and salt water in the Atlantic would be dramatically violated. The gulf stream, the current of warm water which keeps our temperatures higher than they should be so far north, would falter and be turned back south of Ireland. Temperatures would sink till they were lower than they are now. </p> <p>As a first, early sign of how global warming can bring real, swift and disturbing change to the world we grew up in, the thinning of the Arctic ice appears as an early warning light, closer to home and bigger than the inundation of little island nations, more clear-cut than the doubtful premise that global warming means more storms. </p> <p>The melting Arctic will not bring flooding directly. But it looks like a sign that melting glaciers in the ancient, kilometres-thick ice caps of Greenland and AntArctica will. Sea levels are predicted to rise by 70cm in the coming century, putting the people of low-lying countries like Bangladesh at ever greater risk of disaster. Rising temperatures will render swathes of semi-arid African land desert, and lead to increased rainfall elsewhere, meaning greater floods. </p> <p>Sceptics of global warming point to the lack of reliable weather records going back more than a century, arguing that it is impossible to distinguish between natural cycles in the weather and man-made changes. Yet examination of ice and sediment samples going back hundreds of thousands of years suggests that, in fact, the recent rises in temperatures are an aberration. </p> <p>Accepted theories about the wobbles in the Earth's orbit, which are thought to cause ice ages, suggest that we can expect our next ice age in 25,000 years time, and that we are approaching the peak of natural warmth in the ice-age cycle. The difference in average global temperature between getting vineyards in Yorkshire and getting glaciers in Scottish glens is very small - only four degrees celsius. In other words, by adding a few degrees to the planet's natural temperature at the time when it is peaking anyway, we are moving into wholly unpredictable territory. </p> <p>Politically and - some scientists fear - practically, there may be little we can do but try to help protect developing countries, which are likely to suffer the hardest, from the consequences of global warming. For the next few generations at least, western Europe and North America are set to experience climate change that is dramatic enough to notice but not dangerous enough to be beyond management, making it still possible to ignore the plight of nations and ecosystems which are more at risk. </p> <p>Not that the changes won't be brought home to our shores in painful ways. \"The 1953 floods on the east coast of England were caused by storm surges,\" said Wadhams. \"If there are higher sea levels to begin with, it will be worse. The chances are there are going to be some disastrous floods on the east coast in the next few years. If I were living near the coast in Suffolk or Essex, I'd really be a bit worried.\" </p> <p><strong>Global warning:</strong>What will happen if the world keeps getting hotter </p> <p>* Increased risk of flooding in Bangladesh: already ravaged by periodic floods, loss of life and property gets worse as the sea level rises. Nile delta also at risk. </p> <p>* Famine in Africa: semi-arid regions in sub-Saharan Africa turn to desert, making the food situation for some of the world's poorest countries worse. </p> <p>* Disease moves north: mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria, yellow fever, dengue fever and encephalitis spread into new territories. </p> <p>* Trouble in New York: ferocious storms become a regular occurrence. Parts of Manhattan experience frequent floods. </p> <p>* The map changes: the Florida everglades are inundated, changing the shape of the US. </p> <p>* Danger in England: rising sea levels combine with storm surges to overcome the sea defences on the east coast. </p> <p>* Birds die: an estimated 24m geese, sandpipers, dunlins and stints have to find new breeding grounds or perish, due to forestation of the Arctic tundra. </p> <p>* Polar bears starve: as global warming melts the Arctic ice, the bears have less chance to fatten up on the seals they catch through the ice - their weight plummets and cubs starve.

  "The land of the free now wields an absolute power, free of responsibility, such as the world has never known. The rest of the globe watches its elections with renewed anguish as powerless spectators and demi-subjects. The two conventions displayed all that is most repugnant and alien in a political system corrupted beyond recognition in the democratic world. <p> The $100m campaigns lift off in an obscene haze of sanctimonious, lachrymose religiosity, oozing family unction and lies. With 77 days to go and contenders neck and neck in the polls, George W Bush says that Jesus is his guiding influence, Al Gore and Joe Lieberman share a prayer with reporters and both campaigns promise instant gratification and no sacrifice for anything or anyone ever. Dishonest fantasy politics turn America into an out-of-control, self-absorbed, infantilised monster. </p> <p>The richer, stronger and more globally unaccountable America becomes, the more self-centred its politics grows. The end of the cold war should have brought great psychological dividends. Generous in global victory, free of paranoia and with wealth beyond imagining, here at last was its chance to become what it has always believed itself to be - the brave, the beautiful, the free and so on. </p> <p>The high-flown rhetoric of the conventions is echoed in every high school valedictory speech, in every rotary and church, pledging allegiance to a constitution that has lost any vision of society beyond the pursuit of happiness. God's chosen people, uniquely blessed, nurture a self-image almost as deranged in its profound self-delusion as the old Soviet Union. The most advanced, knowledgeable, educated, psychoanalysed, therapised nation on earth knows nothing of itself, irony-free and blind to the world around it. </p> <p>This is the indictment: </p> <p>\u0095 Global warming: both poles are now melting and the process can never be stopped or reversed without America. The US federal government report on climate change itself predicted a 5-10C heat increase this century, with attendant fires, droughts and floods. A quarter of the world's population consumes 80% of its energy, most in the US. At Kyoto the US agreed to a very modest 7% cut in emissions by 2010. Congress refused to ratify it and since then America's emissions have increased by over 20%. </p> <p>The Republicans deny the cause of global warming, Democrats say nothing of cuts. As a result other countries are now sliding out of Kyoto promises, finding loopholes. Why should politicians in France or Germany take huge political pain in demanding cuts from their voters when the monster across the Atlantic goes on guzzling? With global power should come global responsibility to lead, but it doesn't. </p> <p>\u0095 Defence: Congress's refusal to sign the comprehensive test ban treaty last October virtually urges others to acquire their own weapons. The Bush camp talks of tearing up the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty. Both parties are committed to the insane national missile defence system, putting the US under an umbrella protecting it from imaginary threats by \"rogue\" states that might lob a missile across, presumably unafraid of retaliation. It will end the old mutually assured destruction policy by which the world survived the cold war. Costing $60bn, it works even less well than the smart bombs of recent wars but still arouses fear and anger in China and Russia. Zbigniew Brzezinski calls it the mentality of the \"internationally gated community\". </p> <p> Such isolationism will make the US role as a good global police force less likely: already political cowardice at losing any US soldier's life damaged its moral credibility in a genuinely unself-interested intervention in Kosovo. </p> <p>\u0095 The third world: the US promised $600m towards the relief of third-world debt, with 25 countries partly aided by the end of this year. Not a penny has been paid because Congress refused. The rhetoric was good - a recent US poll showed half the population thought the problem already solved - but even Uganda, the exemplary \"good\" poor country, has still received nothing. </p> <p>Following US parsimony, the EU and Japan have been dragging their heels too. If the world's richest country, whose GNP has risen by a third in five years, hasn't paid, why should anyone else? Then there are the world trade negotiations, wrecked instead of saved by US political selfishness. </p> <p>\u0095 Poverty: a nation that does next to nothing about its own poor is unlikely to offer much to other countries. While US stock market values have increased five-fold in a decade, with half of all shares owned by 1% of the people, welfare has been cut to a five-year lifetime limit. With 40% of the people not covered by medical insurance, Medicare for the elderly is being cut by $115bn - and the Republicans promise far worse to come. </p> <p>Virtually all the income gains of the last five years have been enjoyed by the top 20% of the population. The real value of the minimum wage is still below what it was in John F Kennedy's day, income distribution as unequal as in the 1920s. (Bill Gates' wealth is equal to that of the entire bottom 40% of the nation). The poor go to jail in a country that imprisons more than any dictatorship - 5% of adult males are under \"correction\". Some 3,500 people await execution on death row; 580 have been executed since the Supreme Court lifted its ban. </p> <p>This is not the portrait of a civilised modern state. We are deceived by history. We are deceived by the myriad rainbow wonders of America, this mighty engine of invention and imagination, of creativity and enthusiasm from sea to shining sea. Europeans visit New York, San Francisco or Cape Cod, read the great American novelists and intellectuals, revel in America's popular culture, films and art and admire the super-sophistication of its academic discourse.</p> <p> It's rather like visiting St Petersburg before the revolution, wondering at the brilliance of Tolstoy, Pushkin, Chekhov, Dostoevsky or maybe Faberg\u00e9, while trying to disregard the Tsar. The US constitution is kept on a mighty altar and lowered into a bomb-proof shelter at night as if it were indeed the guarantor of freedom: all it proves is that constitutions, freedoms of speech or information are only a small part of a good society. (The Soviet constitution was a pretty good document too.) </p> <p>In elections there is always a better and worse. Bush is terrifying - in hock to oil and arms, promising a $1.3 trillion tax cut to the exclusive benefit of the top few. Gore is better. But whoever wins, America's dismal failure to address the key questions with any realism must strengthen European resolution on future unity. The life, views, values, ideas and politics of any town or village anywhere in the EU feels much more like home than any small town in middle America these days. The more we look at alien America, the more European we feel and the stronger we need to become. </p> <p> <a href=\"mailto:polly.toynbee@theguardian.com\"> polly.toynbee@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "The number of people sleeping rough in England has fallen by more than a third over the past two years, according to figures released yesterday by Louise Casey, the government's homelessness tsar. <p>She told the prime minister that good progress was being made towards his target of bringing all rough sleepers in from the cold. But there was a huge amount more to do to help those addicted to a life of drugs and street crime - and to support vulnerable people who were in danger of becoming the next generation of down and outs. </p> <p>In a progress report to Tony Blair, Ms Casey's rough sleepers unit said there were now about 1,180 homeless people on the streets in England. That was 28% down on this time last year and a 36% reduction on the year before. </p> <p>The largest concentrations of rough sleepers continued to be in central London boroughs, with nearly a fifth of the national total being in Westminster. </p> <p>Oxford, Brighton, Nottingham, Birmingham, Manchester, Cambridge, Bournemouth and Bristol each had more than a score of rough sleepers, acording to latest estimates. </p> <p>They will be among 32 authorities outside London to benefit from an extra \u00a39.5m distributed yesterday by the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions as part of a \u00a3200m programme to reduce numbers of rough sleepers by at least two-thirds by 2002. </p> <p>Ms Casey said achievements so far included the appointment of teams in London and other big cities to make contact with rough sleepers and give them the help needed to \"come inside\". </p> <p>An extra 800 hostel bed spaces for vulnerable rough sleepers had been created in London, bringing the total to more than 2,000. There were also better services to combat drug misuse among rough sleepers and projects to help people leaving the streets to move on from hostel accommodation into training and work. </p> <p>Shaks Ghosh, chief executive of Crisis, a charity for the single homeless, said the progress report was an important first step. New bed spaces and services helped to reduce numbers sleeping rough, especially outside London. </p> <p>\"But I am worried about the numbers of people who are coming off the streets only to be warehoused in hostels, emergency shelters, and other temporary accommodation for months and even years.\" They needed support if they were to have a chance of rebuilding their lives. </p> <p>Crisis estimated there was a \"hidden homeless\" population of 400,000, including people in squats, bed and breakfast, and sleeping on friends' sofas. It said many were at risk of becoming the next wave of rough sleepers. </p> <p>Archie Norman, shadow environment secretary, said: \"This is a disgrace, not a triumph for New Labour. The government has promised \u00a3200m to tackle rough sleeping - \u00a3125,000 per rough sleeper. Yet even if they have managed to get 400 people off the streets, this is still less than the rise in homelessness.\" </p> <p>Figures provided to the Conservatives from the Commons library showed 27,050 were classified as priority homeless in the first quarter of 1997, compared with 27,700 in the first quarter of 2000.</p>",

His role at Scottish Widows Investment Partnership is to be split between Bill Main, who becomes chief executive officer, and Sandy Nairn as chief investment officer.</p> <p><strong> Union warns of bank job losses</strong><br> </p> <p> A union has warned that up to 600 jobs could be lost as a result of plans by Lloyds TSB bank to contract out cheque processing. Unifi said outsourcing clearing operations to a Barclays site in Northampton could mean Lloyds TSB centres in London and Birmingham will close over the next three years. </p> <p>Lloyds TSB dismissed the claims as speculation. But John Bancroft, Unifi national officer, said: \"It is clear that the bank at this stage is not offering redeployment in Lloyds TSB, or indeed voluntary severance. This may mean taking some form of action to fight to save jobs.\" </p> <p>The union is to hold an emergency meeting with staff in London today.</p> <p><strong> Brussels lists EMI worries</strong><br> </p> <p>EMI has received details of the European commission's objections to its proposed joint venture with Time Warner's music operations. </p> <p>The commission announced in June it had begun a four-month extended inquiry into the link-up. </p> <p>\"We are not surprised by any of the issues identified in the document and at first reading we do not believe that these cause substantial obstacles to clearance,\" EMI said. \"We remain confident that we are on track to close the venture by the end of this year as expected.\" </p> <p><strong> Oil to last 'at least 20 years'</strong><br> </p> <p> Crude oil should be plentiful for at least 20 years but natural gas will take the world energy spotlight as the fuel of the future, Shell chairman Mark Moody-Stuart yesterday told the Offshore Northern Seas conference in Norway. </p> <p>\"We don't expect significant oil constraints until at least 2020,\" he said. He expected additional finds of natural gas. \"There is a clear and understandable global trend for gas. In Shell, we have long seen a bright future for gas.\" </p> <p>Mr Moody-Stuart said oil prices, at a new 10-year high of over $30 a barrel, were unlikely to fall soon.</p> <p><strong> Microsoft tries to apply brake</strong><br> </p> <p> Microsoft has again urged the US Supreme Court to let its appeal against anti-competition findings be heard by a lower court first, saying the need for a thorough review was more important than speed. </p> <p>The filing was a response to the justice department urging the court to consider the appeal on an expedited basis because of the case's importance to the economy. </p> <p>Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson in June ordered that the firm be split in two.</p>",
  "<p>Shares in <strong> Lloyds TSB</strong> moved sharply higher yesterday as a huge American mutual fund decided to buy a chunk of the company. </p> <p>According to traders, the unnamed fund has decided to build a stake in Lloyds because it feels the bank is cheap on fundamentals and in comparison with the rest of the sector. </p> <p>While the majority of banking shares have risen sharply in the wake of <strong> Barclays' </strong> (up 44p at \u00a318.03) deal to acquire former building society <strong> Woolwich</strong> (33.5p higher at 365.5p), Lloyds' share have been sluggish on fears that it will have to make another acquisition to keep its profits coming. </p> <p>Such concerns about the bank's ability to grow without another major cost cutting deal has been cited as one of the reasons for its poor performance over the past year. In the latest 12 months, Lloyds has underperformed the FTSE All-Share index by 30.4%. </p> <p>In that time its position as the doyen of the banking sector has been taken by <strong> HSBC </strong> (21p stronger at 989p), whose shares have outperformed the All-Share by 19.1% in the same period. </p> <p>There were suggestions yesterday that after HSBC's strong run, the US fund was switching it position in HSBC into Lloyds </p> <p>By the close of play Lloyds shares were 52p higher at 650p after 63.5m shares had changed hands. </p> <p>With the rest of the banking sector also in demand - <strong> Abbey National</strong> rose 29.5p to 843.5p, and <strong> Bank of Scotland</strong> added 20p to 588p - the FTSE 100 powered to an 11-week closing high of 6,584.8, up 42.6 points. </p> <p>At its best the blue chip gauge pushed past 6,600, only to fall back as heavyweight telecoms stocks <strong> British Telecom </strong> , down 31p at 810p, and <strong> Vodafone </strong> , off 3p to 261.5p, were hit by another wave of selling. It emerged yesterday that BT has been forced to abandon roadshows for a bond sale of up to $10bn after rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's threatened to make a greater than expected cut to its credit rating. </p> <p>Software accountancy group <strong> Sage</strong> was among the star performers, rising 40p to 576p as rumours of a profits warning were crushed. After a meeting with Sage's finance director, Paul Harrison, at the end of last week, broker Schroder Salomon Smith Barney was so confident the company will meet its forecasts that it has set a 715p price objective for the shares. </p> <p>\"Now that we are only six weeks from the end of its (Sage's) fiscal year, and given the quietly confident air of our meeting, we would be highly surprised if Sage was to bring back analyst numbers prior to the year end,\" SSSB said in a note to clients. </p> <p> <strong> Billiton</strong> led a buoyant mining sector, rising 17p to 294p, closely followed by <strong> Anglo American </strong> , 114p stronger at \u00a338.50, and <strong> Rio Tinto </strong> , up 9p to \u00a311.72. Heavyweight broker Merrill Lynch was behind the gains. </p> <p>In a note to clients the broker pointed out that a soft landing for the US economy (and therefore the global economy) is likely to be positive for the mining sector. </p> <p>On Billiton, Merrill sees no reason why the company should trade at a discount to its net present value of 305p share. \"We believe this company is undervalued in a neglected sector that is rapidly being re-discovered,\" it said in the note. </p> <p> <strong> Marks &amp; Spencer</strong> was again heading south. It shares fell 3.25p to 208.5p, unsettled by a depressing set of half time figures from its footwear supplier, <strong> Lambert Howarth </strong> , down 33.5p to 200p. </p> <p>Lower down the corporate scale, <strong> Oxford Glycosciences</strong> fell 20.7.5p to \u00a317.50, after UBS Warburg cut its rating on the highly-rated biotech outfit to \"sell\" from \"buy\". </p> <p>The move followed comments in the latest edition of the Lancet Medical Journal, in which the safety and efficacy of its drug for Gaucher disease was brought into question.</p>",
  "<p>While the salaries of British company directors seem stratospheric to the average worker, executives themselves look enviously at their US colleagues whose remuneration packages are in a different league. </p> <p>The world's best paid director, according to Forbes magazine is Charles Wang, chief executive of Computer Associates, who was paid $650m (\u00a3437m) last year, mostly because of stock options. In the number two spot, Bobby Johnson from telecoms firm, Foundry Networks, pocketed $230m, again largely due to stock options. </p> <p>As is the case in Britain, US corporate salaries are rising much faster than average earnings. Business Week's annual survey revealed that the average American chief executive made $12.4m last year, a 17% rise on 1998. This means that executive pay packets are a staggering 475 times larger than the pay of the average American manufacturing employee. </p> <p>The pay gap between chief executives and workers is not as marked in Britain where bosses typically earn around 24 times the average manufacturing salary, according to remuneration experts Towers Perrin. The gap in Britain is the widest in Europe. In Germany, the average chief executive earns 15 times the average manufacturing workers' pay, while in egalitarian Sweden executive pay is 13 times greater. </p> <p>The Guardian-Inbucon survey of boardroom rewards established that the most expensive board is Vodafone's where directors' salaries account for 27% of the cost, not as high as the 40% cost of the directors' of Energis in comparison with their workforce. </p> <p>David Marsden, an industrial relations expert at the London School of Economics, says US-style pay packets are becoming more common on the continent, which will widen the gap between workers and their bosses. </p> <p>The driving force is the move by European companies to tap the global equity markets for cash rather than relying on bank finance. This in turn is exposing them to shareholder pressures to perform. </p> <p>The usual justification for the bonuses and stock options which boost US and British pay packets is that it keeps managers working in shareholders' interests by rewarding them when the share price improves. In fact, Mr Marsden says the performance hurdles chief executives must meet are often set so low that they collect even in bad years. </p> <p>An alternative explanation sometimes advanced is that huge chief-executive pay packets exist simply to promote competition further down the corporate hierarchy. By striving to do well in order some day to become the boss, middle managers improve the performance of the whole company. Mr Marsden suggests that if this theory is correct it really does not matter what the chief executive does all day - he or she is just there to provide an illustration of the rewards of success. </p> <p>But there are alternatives to this winner takes all approach. In Japan, chief-executive pay is deliberately linked to pay throughout the company because firms believe it encourages team work. Chief executives earn just 11 times the average worker's salary. </p> <p>Mr Marsden suggests that for new economy firms where team work and shared knowledge are important a flatter pay structure may be more effective at drawing the best performance out of the entire workforce. The dot.com bubble appears to have burst but the employee share options schemes they favoured may still have a future.</p>",
  "One of the strongest old fortresses of King Coal decided yesterday to cut a symbolic link with mining by voting decisively to heat and light all its council buildings with \"green\" electricity. <p>Rotherham council in South Yorkshire will be supplied in future by power from wind turbines and renewable natural sources, including coppiced willow and agricultural waste, in spite of a last ditch rebellion by coalfield campaigners. </p> <p>A meeting of all the Labour-dominated authority's councillors yesterday backed an earlier decision by the executive \"cabinet\" to go green on best value grounds. The move will end contracts for energy from a mixture of coal, gas and nuclear power stations, as well as for 3,000 tonnes of coal used each year in council boilers. </p> <p>\"We need to get the best value and to take into account coming environmental measures like the climate control levy,\" said Mark Edgell, Rotherham council's leader. \"But we are emphatically not turning our back on the mining community to which this area owes so much. We are in the forefront of coalfield regeneration and winning huge investment to create a new future for this part of South Yorkshire.\" </p> <p>The new power source will save Rotherham an estimated \u00a367,000 initially, balancing the \u00a3137,000 it will cost to introduce the change against \u00a3204,000 liable for payment under the climate levy. Yesterday's meeting also heard submissions from Yorkshire Electricity and power experts suggesting that green power would be cheaper in the long term. </p> <p>\"There is no longer a direct link between our power demands and Yorkshire coal anyway,\" said Mr Edgell. \"Existing power comes from a mixture of suppliers, and the coal part of it is likely to include imports from overseas. It is much more important for us to concentrate on bids for funding like the \u00a380m South Yorkshire has won in the latest round of the single regeneration budget, or the enormous investment of \u00a3780m which the county is getting from Europe.\" </p> <p>The decision is likely to win reluctant acceptance from the Coalfields Communities Campaign, a consortium of local councils, including Rotherham, which lobbies regardless of political control. The group's Yorkshire branch has campaigned strongly against the energy switch, but is reluctant to criticise a partner council which has had a high profile in winning regeneration funds. </p> <p>Coal mining unions, however, remain adamantly opposed to the move, amid fears that Rotherham's last remaining colliery, the RJB pit at Maltby, may lose a proposed \u00a330m coal fired power station. Pat Carragher, general secretary of the British Association of Colliery Managers, joined the pit deputies' union, Nacods, in calling for the council to \"continue to fight for the long term future of UK coal\" by changing its mind. </p> <p>Rotherham is the first English council to sign a 100% deal for green electricity, following limited agreements of up to 60% by other authorities. Ken Wyatt, a member of the ruling Labour group, said: \"I'm pleased and proud that we are taking the lead for future generations. The council has a responsibility to set an example.\" </p> <p>Yorkshire Electricity welcomed the move as a boost to its own increased use of renewable resources such as coppiced willow. The firm assured yesterday's meeting that it would not make extra profits from green power, a premium on which currently pays for the development of renewable fuel generators which should get cheaper as use spreads.</p>"
