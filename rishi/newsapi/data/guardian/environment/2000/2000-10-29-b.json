  "A new generation of nuclear power stations is being mooted as a solution to serious doubts about the UK's ability to meet targets for the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions. <p> Conservative trade and industry spokesman David Heathcoat - Amory believes construction of up to eight new-generation pressurised water reactors - the technology used in Britain's most modern plant at Sizewell B in Suffolk - should be considered as a possible solution to Britain's energy problems.</p> <p> Heathcoat-Amory, a former Energy Minister, was due to unveil the new policy at a Commons debate tomor row on the Government's public-private partnership proposals for British Nuclear Fuels.</p> <p> That debate has been postponed, but Nick Gibb, junior Conservative DTI spokesman, intends to argue the case in the rescheduled debate later this month.</p> <p> It will be the first time a major political party has seriously put forward the construction of nuclear power stations since the idea for a third reactor at Sizewell was abandoned in the early Nineties.</p> <p> Heathcoat-Amory told The Observer : 'Taking a blinkered view of this could be cutting off one of the key solutions. There are strong grounds for considering it seriously - grounds of global warming and of security of supply. We should be seeing if nuclear is an option for the future.'</p> <p> Heathcoat-Amory pointed to government figures in the DETR's Draft Climate Change Programme, which predicted carbon dioxide emissions to fall from 1990 levels - 168 million tonnes of carbon - to 152.2m in 2000, before rising to 156.3m in 2010 and 164.9m in 2020.</p> <p> The document itself identifies the tailing off of the current nuclear programme as part of the problem.</p> <p> Dr Helen Wallace of Greenpeace said: 'There is no place for nuclear power as a solution to climate change. Nuclear waste, accidents and the threat of proliferation are all unavoidable dangers.'</p>"
