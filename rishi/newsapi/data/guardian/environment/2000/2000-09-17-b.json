  "<p>Barclaycard, Britain's biggest credit card issuer, has abandoned its stand against the proliferation of low-cost, no-frills credit cards by quietly market-testing one of its own, it was revealed yesterday. </p> <p>In the past the company, with 7.8m cardholders, has consistently faced down calls to match the low rates on offer from new entrants and scrap its annual fee </p> <p>It has also always emphasised \"added-value benefits\" such as its loyalty scheme. </p> <p>But now, with no fanfare, it is inviting selected Barclays customers to sign up for Barclaycard Alpha, a new low-cost card it is trialling with \"minimal\" extra perks, broadly similar to rivals' offerings. </p> <p>The move is the latest indication of growing concern at Barclaycard about competition from new entrants, particularly US-based card issuers, retailers and online banks. While half of its card holders still pay a \u00a310 annual fee and its standard interest rate is 19.4%, there are more fee-free cards coming on to the market offering far lower introductory rates. </p> <p>Earlier this month RBS Advanta announced an introductory rate for purchases of 2.9%. American Express is spending millions of pounds relaunch- ing its green charge card. </p> <p>Barclaycard has opted not to publicise the Alpha card beyond those customers it is targeting, presumably because this could lead to a stampede among its existing cardholders to sign up for the cheaper deal. Barclaycard Alpha has no annual fee and a standard rate of 14.4% for purchases. </p> <p>In a statement, the company said it was test-marketing the new card as part of a development programme \"designed to provide customers with an increased choice of products and services, and to offer more tailored products to cater for the needs of individual cardholders\".</p>",
  "<p>Red Mullet - the exotic fish beloved of posher-than-thou dinner parties - are invading the North Sea. </p> <p>Usually found in the balmy Mediterranean, the fish are migrating north as a result of global warming. Scottish fishermen are catching red mullet in large numbers, while cod and whiting are dying because the water is too warm. </p> <p>Marine biologists say the North Sea is undergoing a rapid 'regime-shift' from a temperate sea to an almost sub-tropical one. </p> <p>In the last decade the amount of plankton - the 'grass of the sea' - has risen 10-fold (90-fold in the winters), and the level of life on the seabed has doubled. A study in the journal Science showed that the Nineties was the hottest decade in the last thousand years. Oceanographers have estimated that in six years the winter sea temperature around the Faroes has risen by 4 degrees centigrade. </p> <p>Red mullet, previously only found as far north as the English Channel, are now breeding off the west and east coasts of Scotland. Dr Chris Reid, director of the Sir Alister Hardy Foundation for Ocean Science, said: 'There's enough to form a fishery.' Other warm-water species, such as anchovy and octopus, have been found in the Channel in the last year. </p> <p>Reid said: 'We are seeing an increase in bio-diversity in the North Sea. This is a very sharp change. It is almost certainly linked to global warming.' </p> <p>Plankton absorbs huge amounts of carbon dioxide and supports almost all other forms of life. The number of creatures on the bed of the North Sea, primarily starfish and worms, has thrived as a result of the increased plankton. </p> <p>But the changes may not benefit the fishing industry overall. Cod and whiting are being driven out and many of the new fish may not be so valuable as the old ones. 'The value of fishery might be reduced,' said Reid. </p> <p>Mathew Davis, of World Wide Fund For Nature, said: 'There are all sorts of invasive species going in, and they are a threat to native species.' The WWF will launch its Oceans Recovery Campaign this week demanding the Government give greater protection to fish stocks. </p> <p>However, the North Sea's life as a sub-tropical ocean may not last long. The melting of the Arctic ice-cap - already 40 per cent gone and expected to disappear by 2040 - is predicted to disrupt weather patterns so much that the north-east Atlantic will grow colder.</p>",
  "The Vatican has given a clear signal that it is considering softening its historic opposition to the use of condoms. <p>A leading member of the influential Pontifical Council on the Family has admitted that condom use may be the 'lesser of two evils' as the Roman Catholic church acknowledges the extent of the global Aids epidemic. </p> <p>In the Vatican-published L'Osservatore Romano, Monsignor Jacques Suaudeau writes: 'If people want to prevent Aids, they must be convinced to change their sexual behaviour. Until a real effort is made in this regard... the prophylactic is one of the ways to \"contain\" the sexual transmission of HIV and Aids.' </p> <p>The move has sent shockwaves through the church. 'This is very significant,' said a spokesman for Britain's Catholic media office yesterday. 'L'Osservatore has become a platform for the exploration of issues on which there might be a change in the official line of the Vatican at some point in the future.' </p> <p>Suaudeau is careful to emphasise that traditional monogamy is his preferred method of Aids prevention. 'Family values guarantee true human victory,' he claims. 'Wherever there is true education in the values of the family, of fidelity, of marital chastity, man will achieve a human victory, even over this terrible phenomenon. There is no hope of halting the HIV epidemic with condoms alone, just as there is no hope of preventing a river from flooding by using sandbags when the main dykes have collapsed.' </p> <p>But his acknowledgement that condoms may be part of a strategy to prevent HIV is a stark departure for the church. </p> <p>In the Sixties a pontifical commission on contraception recommended that Rome should lift its ban on artificial birth control. Catholics had expected Pope Paul VI to accept that recommendation. Instead, when he published his encyclical Humane Vitae he stoutly rejected any change. </p> <p>Suaudeau's latest suggestion is consistent with accepted Catholic teaching on use of the birth control pill, which is permitted to correct severe menstrual irregularities, even though it also prevents conception. </p> <p>Lisa Power, of British HIV charity the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: 'We welcome anything that goes towards recognising the reality of the HIV epidemic. It is also good news for Catholic couples, of course.'</p>",
  "Four days ago, the world's fourth largest economy faced imminent breakdown because just 2,500 protesters blockaded its petrol refineries and distribution depots. They broke up their protest to deliver an ultimatum that if their demands were not implemented within 60 days, they would be back. Protest and free assembly are vital freedoms in a democracy, but what happened last week passed any benchmark for legitimacy. Government and country were held to ransom. <p>The Government was absolutely right to stand firm and offer no concessions. It was right to dismiss the ultimatum as anti-democratic and anarchic. For whom do the protest leaders speak and to whom are they accountable? There are problems with having a weak, utterly implausible Opposition and a governing party with such an overwhelming majority that itself permits no argument and debate within in its own ranks. But for all the system's weaknesses, it is all we have and infinitely better than descending into mob rule. </p> <p>But if the Government got the big decisions right last week, it got almost everything else wrong. Its handling of the oil companies, the protesters and police was baleful. Mr Blair's public statements, oscillating between the bellicose and the pleading, were embarrassing; his Tuesday promise that within 24 hours the situation would be on its way to normality - to be proven almost completely wrong - was downright humiliating. He tried to play Mrs Thatcher with none of her guile or resource and from a position of weakness. He should have remembered her 1981 climbdown to the miners because she could not win, rather than her 1984 victory for which there were two years of preparation. </p> <p>The Government needs to ensure that there is no repeat, and especially to ensure that the fuel delivery system is more robust than at the moment. The oil companies, bent on profit maximisation, now run the system with too few reserves and stocks - the 'just-in-time' delivery system - and have contracted out too much delivery to independent road hauliers who owe them no loyalty, one of the reasons they would not cross the protesters' picket-lines. The Government must instruct the companies to hold more fuel stocks at every point in the supply chain, and to deliver them through in-house tanker fleets. The business contention that their sole duty is to make profit for their shareholders with no thought for their obligations to the wider community, the proposition which the Government has been anxious to endorse to prove its business friendliness, now needs to be challenged. New Labour needs to revisit the stakeholding ideas it dropped in its drive to be more capitalist than the capitalists. </p> <p>But it also needs to re-examine its transport policy and approach to taxation. It has begun to move in the right direction, at last investing in public transport and dropping the fuel escalator that drove up excise duties by 5 to 6 per cent every year in real terms. The concession has proved to be too little too late - and grievously undersold. To reduce the rate of car use demands an imaginative commitment to cheap public transport and congestion charges to deter use of cars at peak times, charges which could finance a lowering of petrol duties. </p> <p>These could be promoted effectively as fair both to the motorist and the environment. However, congestion charges are a form of taxation and, as a result, the Government's commitment is hesitant. For New Labour, taxation, however justified, is Old Labour unless done by stealth. Hence the refusal to raise income tax or argue for it, but instead raise revenue through petrol excise duties. As we discovered, these have reached the limits of what the public will accept. </p> <p>What is required is a government that has more conviction and political spine, one prepared to lead in the pursuit of objectives it believes are just, even if that implies short-term unpopularity. Mr Blair is curiously Janus-like. He showed great courage over Kosovo, and last week there was no doubting his determination to rebuff the protesters. He is determined to construct a just society. But if he wants to achieve this end, he has to argue for the means - and that implies levying taxes, asserting the public interest and demanding that business plays its role rather than escapes its obligations. </p> <p>Last week was not just a tribute to the fragility of Britain's interdependent economy in thrall to the tyranny of profit-driven oil companies; it was also a tribute to a paradoxically strong government that governs so uncertainly. Until the Government asserts itself on tax and the environment, there is a risk that these depressing events could be repeated.</p>",
  "It began in the early Nineties, when an American accountant noticed a gap in the market. To fill it, he founded Coach University, which now has 3,000 students and graduates in the US and a further 300 here. It is not doing badly, either, in Hong Kong, Canada, Japan and Australia. <p>All instruction happens electronically - through teleconferencing and the internet. It takes up to three years to complete the course and it costs thousands of pounds, but apparently it is worth every penny. Every life coach I know swears by it. </p> <p>A life coach, in case you have never heard this term before, is someone who helps you with your work, stress and time-management problems. Some go into companies and work with groups, but most are phone coaches. They work with their clients one by one, on the phone, from home. </p> <p>Most have niche markets that make good use of skills they picked up in their former lives. Thus, coaches with City backgrounds specialise in corporate nightmares, coaches who were made redundant but survived to become their own bosses help others making the same transition, coaches with spiritual leanings counsel people who have discovered their lives are empty. But almost all their clients seek them out in the first instance for the same reason: they are having a terrible time adjusting to life in the new go-with-the-flow, 24-7, flexible workplace. </p> <p>Oh, how grand that sounds. Oh, if only I could say it with a straight face. My own reasons for seeking out a phone coach are a lot less dignified. My problem, you might say, is that I am the problem. </p> <p>I am the perfect global worker: owned by no one, making it up as I go along, and never not working. Last year I wrote more than a hundred articles, for more than 10 papers. I live in Bath, but spent two days a week in Coventry, teaching creative writing. And I wrote a book, and there was only one joke in it. </p> <p>People were always telling me how awful I made them feel for doing less. They said they could not work out where I found the time. This was something they stopped saying if they got a glimpse of my study, my briefcase, or the black hole that was my handbag. </p> <p>My excuse was that I never intended to live this way, and certainly have no training for it. When I was in my twenties I was a stay-at-home mother who wrote novels on the side. I only took up journalism in my mid-thirties, when I got divorced and needed to supplement my income. </p> <p>I found I loved it. It helped me overcome a crippling case of writer's block and was the perfect antidote to the lonely back room where I was still writing my novels. I started teaching at around the same time, and I loved that too. But I did not have to push myself very hard. My shift into overdrive happened in my early forties, when I woke up one morning to find I was the main breadwinner for a family of six that expanded to eight on alternate weekends. </p> <p>That was about eight years ago. I have kept things going by working on what you might call an emergency basis. An assignment came in, and I dropped everything until it was done. The moment it was done, there was another emergency, and then another. The non-emergencies I would leave for a day when I had no emergencies, but that day hardly ever arrived. I could go for a year without filing. I did go for years without an address book, relying on six diaries which were never where I remembered putting them. I seemed to spend half my life looking for an important piece of paper. I failed to pay my taxes on time because I could not find the bill. </p> <p>Three things bothered me a lot more than living in financial chaos. One was that I was having so little time with the family in whose name I was supposed to be doing all this. The other was that I was losing friends, because many of them could not believe I had not been in touch for nine months because I had not had time to find the notebook with their number in it. Then there was my study. I would walk into it in the morning and survey the overstuffed drawers and overloaded power points and bulging accordion files, the leaning towers of unfiled paper, the stacks of unread books, and I would feel as if I was looking at the inside of my head. </p> <p>So you can understand why my ears perked up when a friend who had had similar problems told me she had been 'sorted' by a phone coach. I decided to give it a try. </p> <p>The first coach I went to decided we were not a good match. After hearing my tragedy, she said that if she took me on the first thing she would want to do was change my attitude to work, 'and I sense you don't want that'. She was right, the very idea terrified me. She suggested I try a man named Mark Forster, who liked to 'get his teeth into time problems'. So I rang him and told him about mine. </p> <p>The preliminary session was a cross between vetting a shrink and going to confession, except that all we talked about were my work problems. </p> <p>That was fine with me. I enjoyed every minute of my work-related whinge, and I was very pleased when, at the end, he said, yes, there was 'a lot to be getting on with' and suggested we set a time the following week for our first session. Then came my homework, which was to make a list of all the things I hoped to achieve if we continued to confer for three months and email it to him. </p> <p>This I did. Then, at the appointed hour, I rang him on his coaching line, and he greeted me by name before I said hello. We immediately moved on to a discussion of my goals, which ranged from the impossible - sorting out my address, file, tax record, and tax payment problems, to the unthinkable - balancing my workload so that my various jobs did not collide and ruin my home life, and finding time for friends. The impossible items were, he assured me, do-able. I could not count on having my home life back or my friends flocking back to forgive me within that timeframe, but I could make some progress in that direction. </p> <p>He moved on swiftly to address the case of the missing addresses, outlining the system he used. I told him that it sounded like an excellent plan, agreeing to try it. </p> <p>But after I had put a few addresses into my computer, something strange happened. I got up from my desk, marched straight into another black hole, the bathroom/utility room, and did a full spring clean. Then I went back to my study and decided to buy a laptop. This pattern repeated itself the next week, when I received instruction on files. It happened again when we moved on to money management. I would do whatever homework he set me and a fog would lift, and I would have this huge spurt of energy and set into action a plan dormant so long it was almost extinct. </p> <p>During the eight sessions I have had with Mark Forster since last June he has not once asked me to change my attitude to work. All our conversations have been about the management of the practical. We have talked about systems and strategies, working in spurts, cutting down on commitments and expenditure, how to say no in a neutral voice, how to make paper my number one priority, and how to revise my plans for the future. There has been nothing psychological about it. </p> <p>Now that the fog has lifted, now I am no longer spending half my life looking for that important piece of paper, I have more time to do the things I want to do. I travel less and take on fewer assignments that would have driven me mad. I find the time to read to the children almost every night. I have managed to make peace with a few estranged friends, and I have started on a novel that had been stagnating in my head for years. </p> <p>Most of what I've learnt is common sense. I think I knew most of it already. But the thought of it overwhelmed me. It was easy, though, when there was someone at the end of the line setting me annoying bits of homework. Especially when I found out that this someone had been extremely disorganised in a former life himself. </p> <p>My study still has a long way to go. It still reminds me of the inside of my head. The difference is that now, when I look at it, I have this wild notion that I can change it. </p> <p>Mark Forster 01403 250016 MarkF1000@aol.com.

  "With the news that the hole in the ozone layer now embraces the tip of South America, and evidence that global warming is melting polar ice packs, it is not too late to think about doing your bit for the environment. <p> Certain green habits are cost-free. Start a compost with all your household's organic waste, from teabags to eggshells. Glass, paper, plastic and aluminium should all be recycled. Conserve water by taking showers instead of baths (consider sharing with a companion, for extra eco-friendliness). </p> <p>However, to take this planet-saving business seriously you are going to have to open your wallet. The key is reducing energy consumption: around 13 per cent of UK electricity output is used to wash clothes - and if electricity is not produced by inefficiently burning fossil fuels, it is produced by a possibly more dubious nuclear power plant. So spend a little more on a low-power 'Ecolabel' washing machine (from \u00a3420).</p> <p> Then choose an energy-efficient refrigerator - one that uses less than 150 kilowatts per hour annually. Hydrocarbon refrigerants (HC) have little effect on the ozone layer and global warming, unlike CFCs and HFCs (hydrofluorocarbons), and only add about \u00a350 to the cost of a fridge. </p> <p>Lightbulbs have not changed much since Edison's day - an electrical current is passed through thin metal wire and just 10 per cent of the energy is converted to light (the rest becomes heat). Unless you buy a \u00a315 Compact Fluorescent Lamp (CFL) which uses 75 per cent less electricity, lasts 10 times longer than a standard bulb and pays for itself after 2,000 hours of use. </p> <p>The most environmentally sound mode of transport remains the bicycle, which is not only cheap but will also keep you fit. The average car produces 4.4 tonnes of carbon dioxide, 32.5kg of carbon monoxide and substantial quantities of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide each year.</p> <p> Optimists should also consider a solar-powered water heater (installations from \u00a3800 to \u00a33,000), while a photovoltaic power supply for your house's energy demands will be \u00a320,000.</p> <p> Perhaps the most effective way to save the planet is to set about buying it: you can protect an acre of rainforest for \u00a325 with Rainforest Concern. </p> <p> </p>",
  "We've all read stories of celebrities visiting healers of one sort or another, but healing as an art (and potentially lucrative occupation) is now very much established within the intrinsic fabric of 21st-century society. <p>There is a moment, probably just after having survived the first trimester in utero, when awareness of your surroundings has begun to dawn, but you're not yet big enough to feel claustrophobic. Provided you've been blessed with an adequately strong constitution, you are likely to have experienced a state of absolute wholeness and utter harmony with both yourself and your environment, in which your blood and energy are flowing, your thought-tone is blissful and your entire being feels weightless. Let's, for the sake of argument, call this the state of healedness (or wholeness, in correct English). We then spend our entire lives searching for this apparently lost nirvana - through love, success, possessions, friendship, travel, adventure, extreme sports, partying, spirituality, alcohol and/or drugs. The truth is, this state of wholeness was never lost. That pure foetal consciousness that once was you, still is, but has merely been buried under layer upon layer of conditioned thought and behaviour patterns. </p> <p>The aim of any healing, therefore, is to facilitate a moment - because that's all it takes - of consciously accessing that original foetal state of being, wherein the body-mind complex defaults automatically to 'perfect-flow' mode. If, while in this mode, the body receives clear 'instructions', whether by needle insertion (acupuncture), touch (cranio-sacral manipulation), 'hands-on' (Shiatsu or Reiki, for example), substance ingestion (herbal remedies or homeopathy), or mental suggestion (hypnotherapy, meditation or psychotherapy), it will respond by mobilising its innate intelligence and set about the process of mending itself from the inside out. This self-mending process, though now fully documented and recognised by modern science, remains nonetheless inexplicable and ultimately (as with the intelligence that informs, say, jasmine to smell the way it does) ineffable. </p> <p>No matter which kind of healing you go in for and no matter how great, accomplished or famous the healer, it is fundamentally you who heal yourself by momentarily accessing that underlying state of perfect 'uterine' wholeness within and issuing the appropriate internal command. Neither you nor the healer can force your body to accept the healing. You can only set up the most favourable conditions possible for its facilitation. The rest must be left up to your body's intelligence: Nature, in other words. </p> <p>As with every other vocation, of those members of the healing profession (ie medical doctors, psychiatrists and nurses as well as homeopaths, acupuncturists, herbalists, aromatherapists and other alternative practitioners), only a small proportion will be authentic healers, able to facilitate true healing, no matter what the discipline. The rest will be mere 'technicians'. </p> <p>It's not the discipline that's important, it's the practitioner. I know many people suffering from IBS, for instance, who have been helped immeasurably - in many cases 'cured' - by a consultant, not through surgical intervention, but by his gentle laying on of hands and his empathetic demeanour. For empathy is the key. The true healer is able to empathise fully with the patient's condition and, more importantly, with their experience of that condition. Simultaneously, he (or she) is able to access that 'perfect-flow' mode and thus transmit at that frequency to the patient - which is similar to the way the Dalai Lama is able to transmit his spiritual frequency to anyone gathered before him, regardless of their spiritual awareness. In fact, the mode employed is merely a dance, a ritual that guides the mind and energy of healer and patient. </p> <p>While it is obviously helpful to have been thoroughly schooled in a compatible discipline, healing ability often arises in people with no training: they possess a 'gift', just as Mozart possessed the gift of music. This doesn't mean that you must be in any way special to be a healer. Anyone can be taught, but naturally some will take to it more readily than others. </p> <p>Of course, if your intention is focused enough, you can heal yourself without help. For instance, place a hand lightly on each side of your head. Do nothing but relax completely. Soon you will feel a subtle expanding and contracting rhythm in your skull. Simply follow that with your palms, exaggerating the motion slightly to cause a 'pumping' effect. After a few minutes, stop and enjoy the sensation of inner peace and wholeness that spontaneously arises. Though this is unlikely to clear up all your aches and pains, it may afford you a taste of the healing flavour, and who knows, you could turn out to be the next barefoot doctor. </p> <p><b> Dear Doc, I found your words of wisdom on splitting up helpful, as I have just separated from my wife after six years. However, we still share the same house, which makes it very painful for me, since we lead separate lives. Can you recommend anything to make it easier? Dave, Birmingham</b> </p> <p>If financial constraints make it impossible for one of you to move out very soon, try breaking up the pattern a little, by staying over at friends' places as much as is feasible. The discomfort of adjusting to watching your partner establish a routine without you and the obvious feelings of jealousy and insecurity that will arise will be alleviated by frank discussion and disclosure with both your wife and various friends. It would also be useful to take a few counselling sessions to bolster your self-esteem, which is bound to be battered by the experience.

  "<p>David Beckham almost certainly doesn't know this, but without the influence of the late Ray Petri he would never have worn that famous sarong. There was no Premier League when Petri was alive and football had yet to be fetishised (and Hornby-ised) by the middle classes, but the idea of a gifted, internationally famous, pretty-but-straight, fashion-obsessed, married gay icon of a young footballer wearing a skirt in the street? Ray would have loved it. </p> <p>Had he lived, Petri would have celebrated his 52nd birthday yesterday. Instead he died in 1989, just shy of his 42nd birthday and at the tail end of the decade he helped to define by producing powerfully idiosyncratic images, under the pseudo-corporate 'label' Buffalo, for the pages of the then fledgling 'style' magazines, The Face , i-D and Arena . </p> <p>In the early 80s, Petri coralled a pool of young model-muses (Nick and Barry Kamen, Tony Felix, Simon de Montfort, Howard Napper) and photographers (Jamie Morgan, Roger Charity, Marc Lebon), plus assorted, like-minded west London creatives: hair and make-up artists, musicians, designers, acolytes, allies, cohorts, and hangers-on for whom Petri, the cool, charming, funny, shy-but-gregarious nexus of the group was also a charismatic uncle confessor-cum-mentor-cum-role model. 'People tend to associate the word Buffalo with Bob Marley's 'Buffalo Soldier',' Ray once explained, 'but in fact it's a Caribbean expression to describe people who are rude boys or rebels. Not necessarily tough, but hard style taken from the street... a functional and stylish look; non-fashion with a hard attitude.' </p> <p>Petri was born in Dundee and moved to Brisbane, Australia when his family emigrated there in his teens. By the mid-70s he was back in Britain, running a stall in north London's Camden Passage antiques market. Moving in creative circles among art students and photographers, he'd decided to become a photographer's agent, recruiting some raw talent in the form of Marc Lebon and Jamie Morgan. Still, he soon discovered he preferred a more hands-on approach to fashion photography: the casting and styling of images for which there was, at that time, only a very limited audience. 'It can be no surprise that Ray showed up at our door,' says Nick Logan, founder editor of The Face and Arena , 'Other than i-D , where else would he have gone?' </p> <p>In the early 80s, fashion photography was still largely the preserve of the glossies, but at The Face and i-D , Ray's vision coincided with the very beginning of what has subsequently become the commercialisation and mass consumption of street style. Petri played skilfully with the iconography and mythology of the heterosexual modern hero and the homo-erotic muse. He created new breeds of free-range urban cowboys in Ray-Ban aviators and hats; a suited and booted beauty accessorised by a feathered Native American headdress; a smiling black boxer with a blowsy red rose tucked behind his ear; boys in highly polished brogues worn with tracksuits; Crombie coats teamed with shorts; sportswear and couture; kilts and diamant\u00e9_ and the definitive Petri Buffalo garment, the no-nonsense Nylon MA1 army surplus flight jacket, lined in bright orange, teamed with Levi's 501s: the look that evolved into the predominant urban male uniform of the 80s. </p> <p>From expressing the style of a small gang of west London movers and shakers, Buffalo hit the big time when the heavily pregnant Neneh Cherry took her Buffalo stance from Notting Hill to the Top of the Pops studio and the charts. Funny, but just a few years before the Spices and All Saints bared their big-bellies-as-fashion-statements, the sight of an eight-month-pregnant Neneh gyrating, fecund-but-sexy, on TOTP was a small stylistic watershed - if not the first sign that the 80s were all but over and the in-touch-with-its-feminine-side 90s were on the way. Though necessarily identified with the 80s, Petri would have much preferred both the 90s and the zero-zeros, politically, emotionally, culturally, socially and visually - but then Ray was always ahead of his time. </p> <p>Petri was a fashion stylist long before this was a coveted job description and another amorphous by-product of the global fashion industry. Indeed, in the early 80s, selecting and arranging clothes on models was still known, if it was known at all, as 'fashion editing', but he was an instinctive stylist, using his visual flair and magpie intelligence to produce elegant, unfussy and invariably sensual images of timeless modernity. </p> <p>Petri didn't live long enough to get rich on the back of the fact that his visual influence has now been almost totally absorbed into fashion's mainstream, turned into a hugely successful, branded, marketable, logo-ised industry. Likewise, he never worked with many of the people in the business whom he has inspired directly - the gifted Austrian designer Helmut Lang, say, or, indirectly, the skilled marketeer Tommy Hilfiger, or David Beckham, or any of the tens of thousands of visually savvy teenagers and twentysomethings whose easy, confident mix of fashion and sportswear has been the predominant urban style over the past decade. But in high fashion circles, among names like Giorgio Armani and Jean Paul Gaultier (both of whom he knew well and collaborated with) to today's younger generation of career stylists on their fat, glossy-magazine salaries, advertising contracts and handsome retainers with the corporates, Petri's name commands awesome respect. </p> <p>Ray Petri was a genuinely charismatic figure. The sort of man who, even if you had your back to the door, one still sensed had made an entrance. Tall, smiling and handsome with slightly sad eyes and a gently penetrating gaze, I first met him in the early 80s as a young fashion writer at i-D . He instantly brought out my inner, slavering groupie, but was always sweet enough to pretend he hadn't noticed. Then, in 1987, I moved on to become The Face 's first fashion editor and, for a while, learning on the job, I sometimes felt I was working under false pretences. In fashion terms, there was probably nobody whose approval I sought more than Ray's, but whatever he really thought about my wobbly fashion vision, he was never less than a gent and always treated me as a creative equal. </p> <p>In 1988, I vividly remember Ray coming into the office for a meeting. Seeing his face bearing the unmistakeable stigmata of Kaposi's Sarcoma, I immediately fled the office in tears and angrily walked round the block, muttering 'not fair, not fair, not fair_' before pulling myself together and - mascara messily smeared - having the meeting. Ray didn't bat an eyelid, he was far too big - and too cool - for that. But he was no saint and was not without ego. Indeed, before his death, he had enough of a sense of his burgeoning influence and potential legacy to be editing pictures for a project that, 11 years down the line, has evolved into a beautiful book, Buffalo , edited, written and designed by the Buffalo boys and girls he considered to be as close, if not closer, than family. And as Life magazine's Buffalo reunion portrait reveals, they still are. Now there's a legacy to be proud of. </p> <p>\u0095 Readers can order a copy of Mitzi Lorenz's Buffalo (out 21 September) for \u00a326 (rrp \u00a330), plus 99p p&amp;p, by calling The Observer CultureShop on 0800 3168 171, or sending a cheque, payable to The Observer CultureShop, to Observer Buffalo Offer, 250 Western Avenue, London W3 6EE</p>",
  "<p>There are not many people whose mere entry into a room elicits an outbreak of spontaneous joy and vigorous clapping. 'The Fonz' from the television show Happy Days was a pioneer, but he had nothing on Steve Jobs, the chief executive of Apple. </p> <p>Even before he opened his mouth, Apple's founder and saviour had provoked a mini-Mexican wave out of an astonishingly delirious crowd gathered for last week's keynote speech at Apple's Paris expo. A glimpse of Jobs in his trademark shambolic jeans and buttoned-up black shirt was enough. </p> <p>Jobs is the leader of a tribe that has been rescued from the doldrums in less than three years. It has been rescued in style, and partly because of style. The iMac and iBook, both now famously available in a choice of five colours, as well as the new PowerMac Cube, have been designed to work solidly but simply and to look good. </p> <p>When The Observer met Jobs, he was still in salesman mode about the new Cube. He said: 'It's amazing in that it takes the power of a big super computer - and it's very quiet, so you can hear yourself think. It's just a very beautiful shape and it's very simple and we love it.' </p> <p>He was focused on the new product announcements. At the Paris show he revealed three new colours for iBook - indigo, graphite and key lime - and special editions with new functions: playing DVDs and connecting to digital video cameras. </p> <p>'Customers like [the colours] a lot and they respond to specific colours. They don't all sell the same. Blues are always a top-seller.' </p> <p>The iBook, a rugged laptop with rubberised edges, has an impressive, but not top-end, specification. Nevertheless, it has made significant strides. Measured by revenue, Apple is number one in the world in the education market, Jobs says. Schools and universities have been keen users - and children and students may pose the toughest test of a company whose mantra is that computers should be fun to use. </p> <p>Its professional range of computers, including the G4 tower, the new Cube and the more reserved Powerbook, are particularly popular in creative industries: publishers and designers have always been major Mac users. </p> <p>In the Eighties, Apple popularised desktop publishing, enabling users to design and publish newsletters from home. Today's equivalent in the multimedia world is the iMovie, and Jobs is trying to push it as a killer application for the Mac. </p> <p>'Everyone's taking videos, but they don't do anything with those videos. People have the raw materials to edit it, put a soundtrack or title on it, position it. This lets any body make a movie on their computer with their own video footage, and then put it on the internet,' he says. </p> <p>At a corporate level the company is branded around the creativity of use of its products as well as creativity of design. It's ads implore people to 'Think different', taking a highly creative approach to grammar. 'Its human to like to create things, we make these wonderful personal computers that people use to express themselves creatively,' says Jobs. </p> <p>He appears to be on auto-pilot for the interview, occasionally yawning, and answering four different questions with some variant of 'All we're trying to do is make the best personal computers in the world'. </p> <p>Jobs is jetlagged and tired. The previous night, Apple's showpiece expo in Europe was flooded by the sprinkler system, and there had been a muddle over tickets for his speech, with hundreds of 'Mac-heads' locked out. </p> <p>In the past he has abruptly halted interviews because of questions he did not like. Apple has a strict policy of not commenting on future developments, nor is Jobs keen on talking about the past, and we're advised not to ask anything personal. What's left? </p> <p>He seems an entirely different person from the man showing off products on stage. Although the complete focus on Apple is clear, the genius does not come across. Jobs's appearances in front of crowds are theatrical: he is like an actor, or a magician. In private, there is an extremely hard edge. It is also clear that some of the Apple staff are terrified of him. The operator of one Apple stand, eyes bloodshot from the night's flood rescue effort, visibly trembled as Jobs came into view. </p> <p>But these are, of course, the qualities that have turned round the company from its mid-Nineties slump to seven straight quarters of profits. In the past, Apple's renowned creativity may have caused a lack of focus, but Jobs injected a strict corporate backbone when he rejoined the company in 1997 after 12 years in exile. </p> <p>Another problem of the Apple of the past was that it was leaky. As a comparatively small player with only 5 per cent of the global PC market, it needs to punch above its publicity weight. Spectacular design helps but Jobs also has to save product launches to achieve maximum impact. The iMac launch was a complete surprise and the industry was knocked for six. Since then the constant reinvention and regeneration have not disappointed. </p> <p>Apple goes to spectacular lengths to protect this but the Mac-heads do not complain. They appear to support Apple as anyone else might follow Arsenal. So fervent is their passion that they will boast about the fact that Apple Macs have a higher profit margin than Windows-based PCs, where other consumers might complain of being ripped off. But this loyalty can be excessive, and on entering the Apple expo one is engulfed in a funky business hell. People zoom past on shiny aluminium micro-scooters or on rollerblades. Grown men wear tight black T-shirts emblazoned with 'MacUser' where others might sport the name of a designer. There were repeated attempts to get iBooks autographed by Jobs. </p> <p>Long term, Apple needs to broaden its appeal, and persuade people to transfer from conventional Windows/Intel PCs. 'That's already happening - about 14 per cent of iMac customers are \"Wintel\" switchers,' Jobs says. </p> <p>Mac OS X, the new operating system released in development format in Paris, is key to any attack on the Wintel hegemony. It appears to be trying to do for the experience of using a computer what the iMac and Cube have already done for the exterior. The 'Aqua' user interface - which, quips Jobs, made the Paris flood highly appropriate - has nice user-friendly touches and looks polished. The design uses shadows and translucence. The system is remarkably robust and failed to crash despite the efforts of The Observer IT team. </p> <p>Surprisingly, Jobs prefers to talk of Microsoft as partners - a heresy among some Mac-heads. 'I've known Bill [Gates] for a long time - he and I started out when we were both very young, and now we're not so young and I admire what he's done. Now we're working together on many projects and it's good,' he says. And where does he think the Mac will stand in an era of convergence between television, mobile phones and computers? </p> <p>'Y'know the refrigerator and the television haven't merged. Not everything will come together. There will be a computer and a television for different purposes. Computers will be in everything but the PC is still a very useful tool.' Now the interview time is up. </p> <p>'I wanna go and take a look at the booth - I hear we're crazy down there selling Mac OS X, the line is really long.' The personnel on that stand must have been shaking. </p> <p>Jobs's latest venture with Pixar, his production company behind films like Toy Story and A Bug's Life, is called Monsters Inc... but no, he's not in it.</p>",
  "<p>Tony Blair's vision of turning the UK into the best country in the world for e-commerce has suffered a serious setback after a huge falling out between the major telecom firms and industry watchdog Oftel. </p> <p>The telecom operators are privately outraged at the way the so called 'unbundling of the local loop' is being handled by the regulator. It has now emerged that, in an unprecedented move, BT's six largest rival telecom operators earlier this month met with Oftel head David Edmonds to express their concerns over the rollout of 'broadband Britain'. </p> <p>Cable &amp; Wireless, Colt, Energis, Global Crossing, Thus, and Worldcom fear the regulator has allowed BT to gain a huge head start when it comes to introducing new technologies designed to convert normal phone lines into high-speed data and video networks. </p> <p>The six are concerned that this will stifle competition and result in higher prices. </p> <p>The unbundling process - a move that allows telecom firms access to local loop exchanges to introduce the new technologies - has been described as the most important event in the UK's telecoms industry since it was opened up to competition in the 1980s. The plan is to allow BT's rival operators access to tranches of the country's 5,500 local exchanges via a staggered rollout. </p> <p>Later this week Oftel will announce the first 360 exchanges to be opened up to competition. Telecom firms were invited to vote on which exchanges they wanted to access first. </p> <p>However, the rollout will tomorrow be thrown into question when Nasdaq-listed RSL Com, the UK's fourth largest international carrier, pulls out of the process, attacking what it describes as Oftel's 'toothlessness'. </p> <p>The company has accused Oftel of making an eleventh-hour decision that meant RSL could apply only to access the least populated exchanges. BT, which this weekend is again at the centre of merger talks with AT&amp;T of the US, will be able to introduce the new technology to any exchange - but only on condition that it offers wholesale packages to other operators. </p> <p>Oftel argues that this creates a level playing field among competing operators. </p> <p>'BT will have a stranglehold on customers. It's a disappointing situation that makes a mockery of the regulator's vision of a broadband Britain,' said Barry Mowbray, managing director at RSL Com UK. </p> <p>Another telecom source said: 'This is the equivalent of putting Billy Bunter in charge of the sweet shop.' </p> <p>A spokeswoman for Oftel admitted the situation was being examined. 'We're discussing the licence with BT.' </p> <p>Mike Grabiner, chief executive of Energis, said: 'It's imperative that this process should be handled with the best interests of the customer in mind. It is important that vested interests do not stand in the way of progress.'</p>",
  "<p>Irrespective of your political persuasion or the level in your petrol tank, the fuel crisis made great radio. Wednesday saw the pickets' stranglehold on refineries from Plymouth to Grangemouth really start to bite and the drama of events as they unfolded minute by minute was seized with obvious relish by presenters. It's at times like this that Radio 5 Live comes into its own. </p> <p>One minute, Sarah in Plymouth was talking about the handful of protesters kicking a football by the refinery gates; the next, 10 police vans screeched up and disgorged 20 officers per van complete with body armour and riot shields to disperse the 'mob'. </p> <p>'Two hundred police against a handful of peaceful protesters?' said Jane Garvey to the assistant chief constable of Devon and Cornwall. Had the raid been instructed by the Government? The ACC, who had clearly been on one of those courses that teaches you how to sidestep impertinent questions, said that he did not fully comprehend the terms she was using. </p> <p>He and his colleagues had a responsibility to maintain the health, welfare and quality of life of the local people and had responded accordingly. But surely 200 police men was pushing it? persisted our Jane. That is not the issue, the ACC doggedly retorted. </p> <p>In Cheshire, Jonathan was describing how desperate requests for fuel from local traders - one farmer said all his chickens would die if his fuel-driven automatic feeders weren't switched on - were dismissed by protesters picketing the Stanlow refinery. Forget Stanlow. Jonathan could as easily have been reporting the verdict of a French revolutionary court full of witnesses called Jacques with tumbrels instead of tankers trundling past. Then it was death to the le marquis and vive la r\u00e9publique . Now it was death to the chickens and long live peaceful protest. </p> <p>In the studio, Peter Allen was savaging shadow environment spokesman Archie Norman who was saying that it was time Mr Blair listened to the people. 'Are you suggesting a democratically elected government should give in to mob rule?' said Peter. That is not the issue, said Archie who was obviously on the same course as the assistant chief constable. </p> <p>Radio 5 Live thrives on crisis. You could feel the excitement as the news flashes came in, as the Minister squirmed and as listeners' e-mails were read out. 'Help,' said one. 'I've got to have petrol for the lawnmower - the grass is so long we can't find the peg basket.' Vive le jardinier , death to petrol tax tyrants.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Castaway 2000</strong> BBC1 </p> <p><strong> Big Brother</strong> C4 </p> <p><strong> Jailbreak</strong> C5 </p> <p><strong> Other People's Children </strong> BBC1 </p> <p><strong> The Olympic Games Opening Ceremony</strong> BBC1 </p> <p>You will remember that as recently as last spring, the castaways on Taransay were such a seductive television proposition that due to overwhelming public demand we were treated to a swiftly scheduled week of nightly updates. </p> <p>This week, we returned to Taransay a more sophisticated and jaded viewing nation. Suddenly, titillation by turnip-planting isn't quite enough (the ground is very acidic, apparently, and therefore good for root vegetables), and even though the islanders have all gone pagan-shaped (a diet of root vegetables will do that to you) - burning a wicker man in the image of the ejected dissident islander, Ray, and dancing around maypoles - there is clearly a great deal of depressingly modern backstabbing, bitching, stamping of feet, door-slamming and the mass chucking of teddies out of metaphorical cots. </p> <p>Everybody is the same, but more so. The formerly charming Ben Fogle seems to have lost some of his sheen and (unthinkable just a few months ago) developed an unattractive poor-me whine; Ron the psychotherapist is proving to be disruptive rather than merely maverick; the super-smug Dr Roger is now both metasmug and enthusiastically manipulative; while almost everybody else is obsessed with their rations of snouts and Tropicana orange juice, chocolate buttons and whisky. </p> <p>The whole environment has developed that grubby, misanthropic air of bitter hippydom, just like all those post-Altamont Sixties drop-out communal dreams turned sour. But worse than this, unfamiliarity has managed to breed viewer contempt. This week, we were watching events filmed as long ago as May, and in the Big Brother era that's just not fast enough. In the space of a few short months, <strong> Castaway 2000</strong> now looks like time-lapsed, old-fashioned docusoap 'reality TV'. Who would have thought it? </p> <p>Meanwhile, the final days inside the <strong> Big Brother</strong> house saw a kind of semi-competitive ennui, and nights revealed that the three remaining housemates were so bored by each other's company (and their own) that it was invariably - yawn - lights out by 10. There were some last-minute, vote-grabbing tactics to be seen in the task of caring for Juanita, the spooky 'baby simulator'. </p> <p>Father-of-three Darren looked the most convincing, but that may have been because Juanita matched his skin tone. Craig gave a good impression of a man keen to embrace fatherhood and thus win over any wavering female voters ('I really respect all those single mothers out there, looking after those little babies!' Oh give it a rest Craig!), but Anna won on points merely by using the 'breastfeeding' device. Happily, nobody tried to smother little Juanita or leave her overnight in the chicken coop, even though we could have done with some controversy. </p> <p>Though Craig had a strong lead at the polls all week, I was still rooting for Anna right up until Thursday, at which point she let her fans down rather badly when, given the opportunity to select a favourite song to be played by Big Brother, she revealed an aspect of her personality we really didn't need to know. </p> <p>Out of all the songs in the world , she inexplicably selected, without a trace of irony (indeed, she got a bit moist of eye), a truly dreadful piece of 1980s electro-pap, 'Electric Dreams' by Phil Oakey and Giorgio Moroder, thus pretty much throwing away the previous nine weeks of carefully-cultivated credibility. Darren's choice, meanwhile, was a transparently vote-grabbing dance track favoured by his kids, while Craig sang along (badly) to Rod Stewart, at which point one suspected it was all over bar the ticker-tape parades in Liverpool. </p> <p>So as Big Brother settled down, Channel 5's big new reality gameshow, <strong> Jailbreak</strong> , kicked in. Having lost a heavily-pregnant Ulrika Jonsson as presenter at the last minute, the job fell to Craig Charles, who perhaps lacks the requisite va-va-voom factor. Admittedly, it's early days, but Jailbre ak looks like a confusing mess. The great success of Big Brother has been the fact that, weekly tasks aside, the contestants have had to make their own entertainment, and so we swiftly got to know the individual characters and see how the group dynamic was evolving. </p> <p>Like BB , Jailbreak also features 10 contestants, this time competing to escape from a purpose-built jail constructed by 'the UK's leading prison architects'. But there is also a confusingly large supporting cast of slightly too sadistically real (though presumably resting) screws and a genuine governor, Jim Heyes, whose CV includes a clutch of Great Train Robbers, a Kray, 'Mad' Frankie Fraser and the Gartree prison riot of the Seventies, plus two roving reporters in the form of Charlie Stayt and Ruth England. </p> <p>With all this lot competing for screen-time so far, there's been little opportunity to get to know the con testants, despite the pre-filmed inserts: 'Hi! My name is Laura and I'm an office manager and glamour model.' Cue footage of Laura writhing in her smalls but, strangely, none at all of her ordering in the office stationery. </p> <p>It looks like a very daunting task to escape from the jail. It also looks unlikely to be achieved by one person working on their own. And, though doubtless accounting for a lot of the hits on the website, it appears spectacularly unlikely to be managed by Laura (in tears, for some reason, on day one: 'So, so sweet, but a little bit out of her depth,' explained formidable ex-RAF drill instructor Jenny) or the glamorous granny, Pat, who is rather distracted by having left her Carmen rollers at home. Keep 'em all locked up, I say, and throw away the key. Though if Channel 5 can tighten up the direction and editing, I'll probably be completely hooked by this time next week. </p> <p>I'd never read a Joanna Trollope before, but I thought I'd do my homework before viewing <strong> Other People's Children</strong> . Much to my surprise, there were no Agas in the book, but I think I spotted one on the screen (though, of course, it could have been a Raeburn) and Trollope turned out to be far more clogged-kitchen-sink than pristine-designer-range, so the BBC's adaptation was a very watchable, dirty realist bit of domestic business. Exploring the fallout caused by multiple mar riages, dead parents and the unexpected creation of mutant step-families, it provided Lesley Manville with a peach of a part as Nadine, a freshly divorced mother-of-three on the verge of a partially self-inflicted nervous breakdown. </p> <p>Determined to infect her family with her own bitterness and sense of betrayal after 17 years of marriage, she had relocated the kids to a rundown rural cottage (the home with the recalcitrant range) where they were free to indulge in a rich assortment of rages. </p> <p>Railing convincingly against the unfairness of a life in such reduced circumstances, while also struggling to be a 'good' mother, the scene in which Manville shouted abuse at her kids (and her absent ex), before attempting to coax a smile out of her emotionally bludgeoned brood with promises of 'Hot choccy? Hot choccy-woccy?', will have sent shivers down the spine of anybody who has ever been on the receiving end of a bit of irrational and misguided motherly 'love'. </p> <p>Shivers down the spine, too, at <strong> The Olympic Games Opening Ceremony</strong> . Sorry, I can't help it, but I love an Olympic opening ceremony - and I think I'd rather watch it on television than be there. How else do you get to see a 'ballet with lawnmowers' and then be told that Australia invented the lawnmower? Or find out that Hungary has more doctors per head of population than any other country on Earth and 'some very pretty ladies, too'? </p> <p>Is there ever going to be another opportunity to watch Rupert Murdoch waving his pair of patriotic green-and-yellow glove puppets (Wendi looked unimpressed), or to get a bit teary when the two Koreas joined forces to carry one flag and the leaderless, smiling East Timorese danced into the stadium under the banner of 'Individual Olympic Athletes'? </p> <p>Yes, for those four-and-a- half pretty hours, it was almost possible to watch thousands of shiny young athletes without being tempted to play Spot the Human Growth Hormones. Almost possible, but I'm sure I spotted a few.</p>",
  "<p>Will this be the future of football? A double-header that starts with Australia's women taking on Sweden; and is followed by Australia's men playing Nigeria. Both games played in exquisite, sparkling clean stadium with plenty of fine food - Honey Soy Drumettes, anyone? - and cappuccino for all. Football repackaged as the global family game, wholesome fun for the soccer mums and dads and sons and daughters. It's possible. </p> <p>It was a bad night for Australia. The Olyroos are definitely out of the Olympics, the Matildas are long odds-on to follow them. (No apologies for the monikers for they are obligatory at the Friendly Games with even newsreaders using nicknames rather than surnames). </p> <p>It wasn't, however, necessarily a bad night for Australian football with the men's game against Nigeria being a belter. Both sides needed to win after Australia had been somewhat unfortunate to lose their opening game to Italy 1-0 and Nigeria somewhat fortunate to draw 3-3 with Honduras. The Australian defeat had been caused by a blunder by West Ham's Hayden Foxe described by his manager as being 'like Beethoven'. A bit deaf? No, 'a man who wants to do things with class all the time'. </p> <p>Within 22 minutes Australia were 2-0 down. Vince Grella gave the ball away in midfield, Garba Lawal stormed forward and Pius Ikedia walloped the ball into the net. Pius is a little gem; a Nigerian Jimmy Johnstone with pace if you'll allow me to get carried away. Their second was even better, Julius Aghahowa dribbling through on the break before lifting the ball over Danny Milosevic. He celebrated with five consecutive back-flips. Team captain Celestine Babayaro once attempted this trick in a pre-season friendly for Chelsea - he injured himself badly enough to delay his debut for many a month. Aghahowa was different class. Almost Olympic gymnast class. </p> <p>The crowd loved it. They resembled a pantomime audience and it was a perfect panto moment. Oh how they cheered the goodies' rare successes and booed the baddies, referee Carlos Eugenio Simon, interventions. I'm almost certain I heard someone call out 'he's behind you'. </p> <p>The problem was that the panto seemed over before it had really begun. Nigeria were sharp, inventive, fast. Australia were men-at-work-man-like. But never underestimate Aussie grit. Beethoven, aided by a deflection, scored from a free-kick and then Kasey Wehrman, who plays for Perth Glory, chipped the ball to Viduka who back-heeled it into his path and he scored magnificently. </p> <p>Pandemonium. 'Ladies and Gentlemen that concludes the first part of this match, the scores are Australia two, Nigeria two,' announced the PA. And everyone went off for interval snacks. </p> <p>The panto's best scene occurred 10 minutes into the second act. There was a fracas and Captain Emerton pushed Captain Babayaro who fell theatrically to the ground. Suddenly everyone was involved in the set-piece. Primarily Simon Colosimo who ran half the length of the pitch wagging his finger at Julius Aghahowa all the time. The crowd didn't know whether to cheer or boo, laugh or cry. And referee Simon wasn't too certain how to react either, finally deciding, in a spirit of compromise, to dismiss both Captains - an Olympic first? </p> <p>Emerton, who had played well, could have no complaint, Babayaro, who had played abysmally, must have asked if he could be dismissed from the stage to save himself further embarrassment. </p> <p>There is, of course, a moral to the panto. The finger-wagging Colosimo making the error that lost his side the match - Victor Agali profiting with the winning goal. </p> <p>Earlier, the Australian women had played out a game that was nearer to mime than pantomime. Yes, it was that dull. The Swedes should have won it in the first-half. Instead, the Australians took a 57th minute lead through best player on the pitch Cheryl Salisbury. Ten minutes later Sweden equalised from the penalty spot. The result is unlikely to help either. </p> <p>Afterwards, Cheryl said about a game in which they lost the corner-count 15-1, 'today we played the football'. The footballing women have learnt how to talk the talk and it won't be long before they start walking the walk.</p>",
  "<p>Imagine a Britain with sunshine nearly every day- a Britain so warm that palm trees grow on the edge of all beaches. </p> <p>Discounting the effects of global warming, the closest you can probably get to this Britannic idyll is by making the nine-hour air journey to Grenada in the Caribbean. In our English-speaking former colony, the red telephone boxes are exactly the same as the London ones. The Queen still reigns. The policemen have 'ER' badges on their caps, more than matching the British bobby for smartness, right down to the black, shiny boots. </p> <p>Despite the old horrors of empire and sugar plantations, the 95,000 islanders have a great affinity with the Brits and the Irish. When I went there on a windsurfing holiday in a party of about 30, everyone was impressed with the place. </p> <p>Grenada could be the world capital of beautiful, pale sandy beaches bordering on to gentle turquoise seas. Its tiny area - 20 miles long and 12 miles wide - is also home to small rainforests, Hollywood-style waterfalls and Mount Qua Qua, the volcanic crater-turned-lake. </p> <p>If your tastes also run to Guinness and cricket, you will probably never want to leave the so-called 'Spice Island'. The location of a Guinness brewery just outside the capital, St George, is testament to the marvellous quality of the water. Grenadians, like their fellow West Indians, are cricket-obsessed. They have a new national ground which, in the year since opening, has already hosted international matches. </p> <p>Tours of the interior will make clear how the country became known as Spice Island. Many of the inhabitants make their (small) living by cultivating nutmeg and cinnamon trees and selling their produce at the colourful and lively St George market. When the wind changes, you often find a different spicy fragrance in the air. Cloves and saffron are also produced in large quantities - and you will often find yourself walking on paths covered in nutmeg shells. </p> <p>But the island is still poor. While no one appears to starve, very few people reach European standards of living. Most British holidaymakers could buy the entire stock of any of the St George market stalls without noticing the outlay. Some holidaymakers will rejoice in the fact that Grenada is 'unspoilt'; others will feel slightly uncomfortable that the locals benefit so little from tourism and trade. There are signs, however, that international investment will start to enrich the local economy and provide more restaurants and other facilities for affluent Western travellers. </p> <p>Only a couple of restaurants stand out now. Nutmeg on the Carenage, St George, provides wonderful views of the harbour and a three-course meal for about \u00a320 a head. Aquarium is approached by a road that is little more than a dirt track behind the international airport but is probably one of the most beautiful restaurants in the world. For about \u00a320 a head, you eat in a setting that could be used for a James Bond film - set into the side of a cliff, looking like a giant tree house and overlooking its own quiet share of sandy beach and gentle sea.</p>",
  "The site of an acrimonious three-way struggle that autumn between Blair, Brown and Mandelson was the Post Office, the future of which was a litmus test of New Labour's attitude towards the public sector. Blair was eager for the Post Office to be privatised. Mandelson, who suffered a rough ride from the trade unions and the party over the issue, finally nudged the Prime Minister away from the idea. It would be hard to reconcile with their manifesto pledge to keep it in state hands, and Mandelson believed he had hit upon a 'Third Way' compromise. He proposed giving the Post Office more commercial freedom. This satisfied Blair, but it attracted the contempt of Brown. The Chancellor regarded Mandelson's plan as intellectually feeble and a costly fudge. The Treasury would lose part of its revenue stream without gaining any of the proceeds of a privatisation. Mandelson appealed to No 10, asking Blair to throw his weight into the wrestling match with Brown. Prime Minister and Chancellor had one of their most murderous arguments. A witness describes it as 'a foetus-position row', meaning everyone else present hunched themselves into a ball until the storm blew over. Blair's decision was doubly aggravating to Brown. Not only did the Chancellor resent being overruled, he acted even more the wounded bull-elephant because Blair had taken Mandelson's side. <p>There is no politician who enjoys losing an argument. Few react to being frustrated with such dark wrath as Gordon Brown. When the Post Office scheme was announced, Charlie Whelan, Brown's press officer, gave a brutal and barely disguised briefing against Mandelson. He had 'bottled out' of making a tough decision and come up with a 'dog's breakfast'. Ad hominem abuse against senior members of the Cabinet was far from without precedent from the Chancellor's megaphone, but Whelan was setting a new standard of brazenness. Mandelson, supported by Campbell, urged Blair to force Brown to sack Whelan.</p> <p>'I'll get rid of him by the end of the year,' Blair replied, a pledge to which they reacted with knowing laughter. They had heard this sort of declaration so frequently that they no longer placed any faith in it. Blair's repeated failures to make Brown dispense with the vexatious Whelan had turned the Prime Minister into a butt of ridicule among his own intimates. Jonathan Powell, Anji Hunter and Alastair Campbell would mock Blair to his face about it. 'He'll be gone by Easter. He'll be gone by the summer. He'll be gone by Christmas,' they would torment Blair, taunting him with reminders of how often he had assured them he would deal with Whelan and how he had as frequently failed. Blair responded with a pained frown and a feeble insistence: 'I could get rid of him. I just don't work like that.' This was, on the face of it, a remarkable situation. Here was Tony Blair, reputedly equal in power to Margaret Thatcher in her pomp. This titan of No 10 could not remove a mere press officer. That makes it sound more straightforward than it was. For Blair to insist would mean full-frontal combat with Brown, an incendiary conflict that he was shy risking. The Prime Minister was scared of provoking the Chancellor.</p> <p>Whelan himself was arriving at the conclusion that his days were numbered. He shared with friends ideas about quitting the Treasury of his own volition to pursue a career as a journalist. But it would be out of character for Whelan to depart gently into the night; if he was going, he had the means to take Mandelson with him. He confided to one journalist that there was a 'thermonuclear device under Peter and it's primed to go off in January'. This was the \u00a3373,000 soft loan Geoffrey Robinson had given to Mandelson, before the election and before they moved into warring camps, to purchase his \u00a3475,000 house in west London. Whelan had the means of detonating this sensational information into the public domain. A biography of Mandelson, due for publication in the New Year, was being written by Paul Routledge, who shared Whelan's dedication to Brown and the intensity of his hatred for Mandelson.</p> <p>Mandelson was not oblivious to the danger. He even asked Blair to intercede with Brown to prevent publication. 'I can do nothing about it,' Brown told Blair, and it is highly unlikely the Chancellor could have done, even if he had wanted to.</p> <p>With or without the book, Geoffrey's largesse to Peter was a story begging to see the light of day. Mandelson's secret loan was hugely threatening to him, not least because it was not a secret to several of his enemies. Apart from Charlie Whelan, Ed Balls knew. Brown himself had known about it for a long time. The existence of the loan became known to the Chancellor's closest friend in the Cabinet, Nick Brown, who shared his feelings towards Mandelson. An embittered Robinson was fed up to the point of resignation after being hounded by the media. He was also sour that the ungrateful Mandelson hadn't even invited him to the house-warming party.</p> <p>The secret loan was becoming increasingly less secret, at least within the inner, incestuous circles of New Labour. Michael Wills, the MP for Swindon North, knew. Though a Brownite, he managed to be on amicable terms with a man very close to the Prime Minister. Wills was an old university chum of Charlie Falconer, who had shared a flat in Wandsworth, south London, with Blair when they were both young lawyers. Blair, having failed to secure a seat in the Commons for Falconer, had placed him in the Lords, first as Solicitor-General, and then as number two at the Cabinet Office. That August, Michael Wills and Charlie Falconer, finding themselves holidaying near to each other in Malaga, southern Spain, got together. Wills passed on word of Mandelson's loan. Sworn to a confidence, and not thinking it his place to raise it with Blair, Falconer kept the secret to himself. So Falconer, that best of chums, knew. Brown long knew. Extraordinarily, the one person who had been kept in a state of complete ignorance was the Prime Minister.</p> <p>When, in conversation, Blair made references to 'your flat', Mandelson huffily replied: 'It's a house actually.' Recklessly, he encouraged media interest in 9 Northumberland Place. Vogue was invited chez Mandelson, where Lord Snowdon photographed him posing in the \u00a31,800 tanned leather Balzac chair. The house was given a self-consciously chic \u00a350,000 make-over by a top-of-the-range interior designer. Original features were stripped out to turn it into a shrine of soulless minimalism. It was as if he couldn't stop himself providing the critics with metaphors for what he had helped do to the Labour Party. Campbell occasionally ragged Mandelson about how exactly he had afforded a house worth 10 times an MP's salary. 'Where did you get the money then, Peter?' Campbell baited him. Mandelson never gave a straight answer, but implied to Campbell, as he did to others, that the money had come from his mother. Various explanations were later advanced for why the great strategist had placed himself in the perilous position of concealing this lethal loan from his friends when it was known to his enemies. Was he socially embarrassed? Did he genuinely think it was not anyone else's business? Could he believe that his secret would remain for ever safe with Gordon Brown and his acolytes? Sometimes the simple explanation is the correct answer. According to one of his closest friends, Mandelson concealed the loan because 'Peter knew what he had done was wrong'. Another person who has known Mandelson for many years says: 'He was ashamed to admit it to Tony.'</p> <p>Public shame loomed by early December. The proof copy of Routledge's book was inadvertently sent to the wrong office at the Commons, where it was read by another journalist. There was a tip-off to Mandelson's aide, Ben Wegg-Prosser, young, gently spoken, bespectacled, and sometimes known as Oofy, after the Wodehouse character. By Tuesday 15 December, Wegg-Prosser was aware that exposure was imminent. Not wanting to destabilise his boss until he had finished presenting a White Paper on competition, the aide left it until Wednesday evening to tell Mandelson. He had no choice now but to confess the secret to No 10. Unable to face telling Blair, Mandelson got Wegg-Prosser to ring Alastair Campbell to tell Downing Street about the loan and that it would shortly become public.</p> <p>Tony Blair was in his study that Thursday lunchtime working on the statement he would give to the Commons in the afternoon about military action against Iraq. He had less than two hours to find the appropriate words to announce his first act of war as Prime Minister. Campbell knew that Blair did not want to be interrupted. But what he had just learnt from Wegg-Prosser would produce far more explosive headlines than the munitions raining on Saddam Hussein. The press secretary rushed to the Prime Minister to give him the bones of what Campbell would later characterise as this 'big, bad story'. At first, Blair struggled to muster coherent sentences to express his shock. Then, anger at Mandelson's stupidity transferred itself to fury with the messenger.</p> <p>'Why the fuck are you landing this on me now?' he demanded of Campbell. 'Because it can't fucking wait,' Campbell retorted. 'We have to decide what we are going to do, how we are going to handle it.' As the awfulness of the implications began to sink in, Blair turned to wondering who else had been concealing this timebomb.</p> <p>Did Anji Hunter know? She was on friendly terms with Robinson. She was also a pal of Wegg-Prosser. Blair called her in. She could immediately tell something was badly wrong. Blair looked terrible. 'Did you know?' he demanded aggressively. 'What?' said Hunter. 'That Peter took a loan from Geoffrey for his house.' She felt faint and sat down. 'No, honestly, Tony. Christ! If I'd known, I would have told you.' How big, she asked, was the loan? 'Oh, God,' Blair shook his head in despair. 'Hundreds of thousands of pounds.' Hunter phoned Wegg-Prosser to berate him for not confiding in her. 'Why did you never tell us?' she shouted. 'I couldn't. He swore me to secrecy. I kept telling Peter,' replied a tremulous Wegg-Prosser. 'I kept telling him he couldn't keep it secret. He wouldn't listen.'</p> <p>It is a tribute to Blair's ability to mentally compartmentalise that he could confidently pronounce on Iraq in the Commons that afternoon while the loan crisis was consuming his mind. It was an illustration of how angry, aghast and anxious he was that, even while heavily engaged in presenting and presiding over the action against Iraq, he devoted attention to Mandelson.</p> <p>Mandelson slipped into No 10 under cover of darkness at the end of the week to face a bleakly furious Blair. 'Jesus Christ, Peter! What a misjudgment,' Blair raged. The man who was supposed to be so well equipped with political savvy had shown a catastrophic lack of it. Worse, complained Blair, Mandelson had treated him, his friend and Prime Minister, as a dupe. Mandelson pleaded that he did not believe he had done anything 'fundamentally wrong'. This was not Blair's angriest grievance. Mandelson's selfishness and vanity had betrayed him and their project. Everything they had worked for was imperilled. For not only was Blair shocked, he was fearful. He and those closest to him were already mentally writing the headlines which would be used against New Labour by its enemies within and without.</p> <p>The Prime Minister's press secretary vented his personal rage even more fiercely. The full heat of Campbell's flame-thrower temper was turned on him. To his face, Campbell told Mandelson he had been a 'stupid cunt'. The violence of these reactions is understandable. Everyone feels it most acutely when they are let down by their friends.</p> <p>Blair talked to Mandelson again on Saturday, by which time his mind was turning to what might be done to contain the damage. He told Mandelson to get rid of the loan as rapidly as possible. Paying it off before it became public knowledge might improve the chances of constructing some sort of defence. But Blair was already sceptical that Mandelson could be saved.</p> <p>The mysterious financing of Mandelson's mansion had attracted the interest of several journalists, among them the Guardian's David Hencke, an award-winning investigator of political scandal. After months of truffling, Hencke's assiduity had not been rewarded with the story. Then he got what must have looked like an amazing break. In early December, Hencke received a call from a source he had dealt with before on anti-Mandelson stories. The reporter met this informant on Tuesday 8 December at a most unusual location where both Hencke and his source could be certain they would not be seen by other journalists or politicians. They met at a greasy spoon in the West End. The source did not have the precise figure, but revealed to the reporter the Mandelson home loan from Robinson. They met again at the same greasy spoon six days later, on 14 December, this time with another Guardian reporter present, when the source added the fascinating detail that the solicitor who handled the purchasing of the house was Wegg-Prosser's father. Hencke's source was a senior politician closely associated with Gordon Brown. The motive for priming Hencke was twofold: using another conduit might shield Whelan from being fingered as the source; and the Brown camp, suspecting that Mandelson knew exposure was imminent, may have feared that he would find some way of suppressing or minimising the impact of the story.</p> <p>How complicit was Gordon Brown in the immolation of his fellow Minister and founder of New Labour? Another member of the innermost circle, who has known Brown for more than a decade, says: 'Gordon is absolutely capable of it.' Even if the Chancellor did not pull the trigger, he knew it was being squeezed. Whether or not he gave the precise instruction to strike against Mandelson, Brown willed the act.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/focus/story/0,6903,369241,00.html\">Extract three: The house comes tumbling down</a></p>",
  "<p> I was born in 1947 and we didn't get our first television until 1958. The first thing I remember watching on it was Robot Monster, a film in which a guy dressed in an ape suit with a goldfish bowl on his head - Ro-Man, he was called - ran around trying to kill the survivors of a nuclear war. I felt this was art of quite a high nature.</p> <p>But TV came relatively late to the King household, and I'm glad. I am, when you stop to think of it, a member of a fairly select group: the final handful of American novelists who learned to read and write before they learned to eat a daily helping of video bullshit. This might not be important. On the other hand, if you're just starting out as a writer, you could do worse than strip your television's electric plug-wire, wrap a spike around it, and then stick it back into the wall. See what blows, and how far. Just an idea.</p> <p>By the time I was 14 (and shaving twice a week whether I needed to or not), the nail in my wall would no longer support the weight of the rejection slips impaled upon it. I replaced the nail with a spike and went on writing. By the time I was 16 I'd begun to get rejection slips with hand-written notes. The first of these hopeful notes was from Algis Budrys, then the editor of Fantasy and Science Fiction, who read a story of mine called The Night of the Tiger and wrote: 'This is good. Not for us, but good. You have talent. Submit again.' Those four brief sentences, scribbled by a fountain pen that left big ragged blotches in its wake, brightened the dismal winter of my 16th year.</p> <p>My mother knew I wanted to be a writer, but she encouraged me to get a teacher's credential 'so you'll have something to fall back on'. 'You may want to get married, Stephen, and a garret by the Seine is only romantic if you're a bachelor,' she'd said once. 'It's no place to raise a family.'</p> <p>I did as she suggested, entering the College of Education at the University of Maine and emerging four years later with a teacher's certificate... sort of like a Golden Retriever emerging from a pond with a dead duck in its jaws. It was dead, all right. I couldn't find a teaching job and so went to work at New Franklin Laundry for wages not much higher than those I had been making at Worumbo Mills and Weaving four years before. I was keeping my family in a series of garrets which overlooked not the Seine but some of Bangor's less appetising streets.</p> <p>I never saw personal laundry at New Franklin unless it was a 'fire order' being paid for by an insurance company (most fire orders consisted of clothes that looked OK, but smelled like barbecued monkeymeat). The greater part of what I loaded and pulled \u00bc </p> <p>\u00bb were motel sheets from Maine's coastal towns and table linen from Maine's coastal restaurants. The table linen was desperately nasty. When tourists go out to dinner in Maine, they usually want clams and lobster. Mostly lobster. By the time the tablecloths upon which these delicacies had been served reached me, they stank to high heaven and were often boiling with maggots. </p> <p>I thought I'd get used to them in time, but I never did. The maggots were bad; the smell was even worse. 'Why are people such slobs?' I would wonder, loading feverish linens from Testa's of Bar Harbor into my machines. 'Why are people such fucking slobs?'</p> <p>Hospital sheets and linens were even worse. There were often little extras in the hospital laundry; those loads were like nasty boxes of Cracker Jacks with weird prizes in them. I found a steel bedpan in one load and a pair of surgical shears in another (the bedpan was of no practical use, but the shears were a damned handy kitchen implement). Ernest 'Rocky' Rockwell, the guy I worked with, found $20 in a load from Eastern Maine Medical Center and punched out at noon to start drinking.</p> <p>On one occasion I heard a strange clicking from inside one of the Washex. I hit the emergency stop button, thinking the goddam thing was stripping its gears or something. I opened the doors and hauled out a huge wad of dripping surgical tunics and green caps, soaking myself in the process. Below them, lying scattered across the colander-like inner sleeve of the middle pocket, was what looked like a complete set of human teeth. It crossed my mind that they would make an interesting necklace, then I scooped them out and tossed them in the trash. </p> <p>From a financial point of view, two kids were probably two too many for college grads working in a laundry and the second shift at Dunkin' Donuts. The only edge we had came courtesy of magazines like Dude, Cavalier, Adam and Swank - what my Uncle Oren used to call 'the titty books'. By 1972 they were showing quite a lot more than bare breasts, and fiction was on its way out, but I was lucky enough to ride the last wave. </p> <p>I wrote after work; when we lived on Grove Street, which was close to the New Franklin, I would sometimes write a little on my lunch hour, too. I suppose that sounds almost impossibly Abe Lincoln, but it was no big deal - I was having fun. Those stories, grim as some of them were, served as brief escapes from the boss, Mr Brooks, and Harry the floor-man.</p> <p>Harry had hooks instead of hands as a result of a tumble into the sheet-mangler during the Second World War (he was dusting the beams above the machine and fell off). A comedian at heart, he would sometimes duck into the bathroom and run water from the cold tap over one hook and water from the hot tap over the other. Then he'd sneak up behind you while you were loading laundry and lay the steel hooks on the back of your neck. Rocky and I spent a fair amount of time speculating on how Harry accomplished certain bathroom clean-up activities. 'Well,' Rocky said one day while we were drinking our lunch in his car, 'at least he doesn't need to wash his hands.'</p> <p>There were times - especially in summer, while swallowing my afternoon salt-pill - when it occurred to me that I was simply repeating my mother's life. Usually this thought struck me as funny. But if I happened to be tired, or if there were extra bills to pay and no money to pay them with, it seemed awful. I'd think, 'This isn't the way our lives are supposed to be going.' Then I'd think, 'Half the world has the same idea.'</p> <p>The stories I sold to the men's magazines between August 1970, when I got my $200 cheque for Graveyard Shift, and the winter of 1973-4, were just enough to create a rough sliding margin between us and the welfare office (my mother, a Republican all her life, had communicated her deep horror of 'going on the county' to me; Tabby [Tabitha, his wife] had some of that same horror).</p> <p>I think we had a lot of happiness in those days, but we were scared a lot, too. We weren't much more than kids ourselves, and being friendly helped keep the mean reds away. We took care of ourselves and the kids and each other as best we could. Tabby wore her pink uniform out to Dunkin' Donuts and called the cops when the drunks who came in for coffee got obstreperous. </p> <p>I washed motel sheets and kept writing one-reel horror movies. </p> <p>\u0095 Extract from: On Writing by Stephen King, is published on 3 October by Hodder &amp; Stoughton, \u00a316.99. </p> <p>Next week: the crash that nearly killed me</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/authors/author/0,5917,-98,00.html\">Stephen King on Books Unlimited</a></p>",
  "Britain is playing a key role in developing lethal fungi that could be sprayed over countries illicitly growing cannabis, opium and coca plants, destroying their drug crops, secret US government documents have revealed. <p>Critics have described the programme as 'biological warfare' and likened it to the disastrous use of Agent Orange by the US in Vietnam. They warn the fungi will kill food crops, destroy the environment and endanger human life while having little impact on the world drug trade, which will simply move production elsewhere.</p> <p>US State Department documents obtained by The Observer name British scientist Michael Greaves as a key player in its programme to spray a fungus known as Fusarium oxysporum over Columbia's rainforests in the hope of destroying it coca crops - the source of 80 per cent of the world's cocaine. Until recently Greaves worked for the government-funded Institute of Arable Crop Research in Bristol. He is also the co-ordinator of a secretive UK-funded research project located in the former Soviet republic of Uzbekistan. This is developing another type of fungus aimed at wiping out opium poppies in places such as Afghanistan, where half the world's heroin comes from. </p> <p>The programme is based at the Institute of Genetics in Uzbekistan and run by many scientists who used to work on the Soviet germ warfare programme during the Cold War. The Foreign Office has provided pounds 100,000 of funding for the project, set up in 1998 under the United Nations Drug Control Programme.</p> <p>In 1999 three scientists from the Uzbekistan Institute came to the Long Ashton research centre in Bristol where Greaves was based. UN documents confirm that since the project began it has been extended to look at fungi to kill cannabis plants. The documents also reveal that, despite widespread concerns from environmentalists and scientists, this fungus has already been field-tested in three Central Asian states: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan. Two other states, Kazakstan and Turkmenistan, have so far refused. </p> <p>Disclosure of the extent of British involvement in what some see as 'biological warfare' in breach of the global Biological Weapons Convention will be highly embarrassing for the government. Only last week Cabinet Minister Mo Mowlam was in Colombia voicing opposition to the use of biological agents there. International criticism of the US plan to use the fungus, dubbed Agent Green, has forced President Bill Clinton to backtrack from tying aid to Colombia with spraying of the fungus. The US government has not wanted to be seen as the initiator of this programme and persuaded the UN Drug Control Programme to take responsibility. But the US and UK are the main sources of finance for the multi-million-pound programme.</p> <p>US State Department documents, signed by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, urge the UNDCP to set up testing for 'large-scale implementation' of fusarium on coca in Colombia and to get other countries involved 'in order to avoid a perception that this is solely a US government initiative'.</p> <p> The documents say: 'We would urge the formulation of the UN project to take advantage of the extensive US research using fusarium to target illicit coca Dr Mike Greaves of the UK has already evaluated the host range and exploration data the US has developed.' </p> <p>The fungi work by secreting toxins into a plant's roots, forcing the coca plant or opium poppy to wilt and eventually die. But these fungi can survive in the soil for years and some scientists believe they could be toxic to humans and animals. There is also concern that they spread rapidly, mutate and kill other crops.</p> <p> In Peru in the late Eighties, after an epidemic of fusarium wilt in a coca-growing area caused by this fungus, thousands of peasant families could not grow food. Indeed, a proposal to use the fungus against cannabis crops in Florida was postponed after the state's department of environmental protection warned 'it is difficult, if not impossible, to control the spread of fusarium species. The mutated fungi can cause disease in a large number of crops, including tomatoes, peppers, corn and vines.'</p> <p> Jenny Tonge, the Liberal Democrats' international development spokesman, said: 'Under no circumstances should the UK support these initiatives. They will damage people, rainforests, and pollute the land. Past experience shows that drug production will just move elsewhere. It is time the West looked at how they can curb the demand for drugs from their citizens.' </p> <p>A spokesman for the Foreign Office said: 'There is nothing secret about the project. The UNDCP is seeking safe crop-eradication techniques. This project could lead to a major breakthrough in this field. But these are early days of the project, and much careful, lengthy research is still required.' The Observer was unable to contact Greaves who, according to his wife, is in Uzbekistan.</p>",
  "It was a week of chaos. Emperors lost clothes; the mighty fell; certainties collapsed as authority failed, and every scape was goated. And that was only the press. <p>These petrol protests were spontaneous - they were not planned and they were not whipped up by the media, swore the Sun, the whipper-up-in-chief. </p> <p>Almost true, guv. Only one newspaper - Tony Blair's 'must-read' Daily Mail - seemed on top of unfolding events. </p> <p>It led eight days ago with the prescient question 'When will OUR petrol run dry?' - while the soaraway Bun was still obsessed by Big Brother. It timed its Thursday front-page appeal to the pickets with eerie brilliance. 'As a friend who believes in the justice of your cause, the Mail urges you to end your blockade, while you still hold the high ground.' Whereupon the lower ground emptied. </p> <p>More of the Mail in a moment. The fact remains that the media weren't so much leading this protest as stuck in a traffic jam at the back of a fuel queue. 'French-style fuel protest hits Britain,' said the Guardian. Did anyone realise what was to come? Three-day weeks relived? 'The oil blockades of French lorry drivers, however impressive, do not quite match up in industrial terms to the vice-like grip of 250,000 organised energy workers,' wrote Seumas Milne in the Guardian. </p> <p>But hang on, chaps! By Tuesday the 'Panic at the pumps' which had been somewhere on pages six or seven the day before, was suddenly stage centre. 'Great Petrol Revolt 2000' (the Sun ), 'Running on Empty', cried the Mail ; 'Showdown at the pumps,' said the Express. </p> <p>The reporting bit, was easy. Deciding what was going on, and why, proved more difficult. </p> <p>On the one hand, this picketing gambit had been nicked from the French truckers, and they had been roundly condemned by solemn columns around Britain. </p> <p>On the other hand, blockading had instant poll support from 90 per cent of the populace. </p> <p>The first rule of editorial survival is to find somebody to attack. </p> <p>The Mirror, somewhat oddly, singled out Blair, with a cruel front page on 'Two Jags Tony'. Don't be a 'fool on fuel', it warned him. 'It is not a sign of weakness to react to strong public feelings. That is democracy.' 'Please LISTEN, Prime Minister,' pleaded the Sun . Labour was insulated from reality by life in the kind of chauffeur-driven limos which editors never use. </p> <p>But who were these demonstrators? And why was the Conservative press having such a field day? Enter the Independent: 'The Government should ignore these futile protests from a ragtag mixture of the disaffected, including not just hauliers, fishermen and farmers, but also many Mr Indignants, motorists who have in common only the fact that they would like to drive more cheaply.' </p> <p>Who were the 10 per cent on the polls who didn't want lower-priced petrol, wondered Hugo Young in the Guardian. Probably the greener columnists of that paper and the Indy. But even there nothing was safe or agreed. </p> <p>Zoe Smith, of the Institute of Fiscal Studies, wrote a careful analysis saying that, yes, the 'highest petrol tax in Europe' was the Government's responsibility ('What government takes, government can return') and, no, none of this 'was very well targeted to protect the environment'. Anne McElvoy in the Indy said there was an election coming 'with an awful lot of irate drivers in key marginals, Sierra man will win in the end'. </p> <p>Meanwhile, secondary panic spread. The Sun was jabbering. 'Tony Blair is a decent and capable man - but if he has called this one wrong, his days may be numbered.' The Mirror was quivering. 'Enough is enough.' Anxiety for law and order masked the agon-ised and secretive meetings taking place all over Fleet Street trying to find a way of distributing papers in a world without diesel. </p> <p>Suddenly Tony was right. 'Common sense creeps in,' said the Guardian. And the oil firms set themselves up as the ones everybody could hate. Crisis over. But not, perhaps, memory of crisis. </p> <p>Was this rumbustious episode got up by the press? </p> <p>To believe that, you have to cast the Mail' s Paul Dacre as evil genius, and he has his defences ready - notably a leader before the protests really started which warned against 'the bloody-minded militancy that has plunged France into chaos' and told the protesters to 'leave their cause to the normal processes of democracy'. That isn't a complete defence. The Mail, having seen its advice ignored, rather relished picturing a 'smirking Gordon Brown' and interviewing the rebels 'of a very British blockade' in their deckchairs, 'talking of summer holidays, Radio 4 and how they feel Labour has betrayed them'. Incitement or reportage? </p> <p>At least the Mail knew what was happening before it happened and saw it ending when it did. At least Blair was warned. </p> <p>Does this mean that its subsequent lather about 'the unprecedented Europeanisation of British politics, now uncannily reminiscent of the elitist bureaucracy in France' is right, too? </p> <p>Pass on such old siren songs. The quieter lessons of tumult past are probably more salient. That when people see TV pictures of empty filling stations, they go and fill up. That a mobile phone and an email leaves Arthur Scargill for dead - and reporters out of the loop. That green, alas, will not be the colour of next year's Budget. And that a press which doesn't like a tough issue can always find softer ones. </p> <p>Thus the journals that were weaker on Wapping were ramrod here. Thus the lions of law and order licked their paws. Other boots, other feet; much kicking up of dust. </p> <p>But another power-crazed press plot against our elected masters? Give over - even if the Sun has suddenly found its bombastic voice again. This cacophony couldn't organise a sandwich supper in El Vino's.</p>",
  "<p>Four decades of misguided transport policy chickens - from Beeching's railway axe to motorway-mania - came home to roost on the filling-station forecourts and truckers' barricades around Britain last week. </p> <p>This standstill has been waiting to happen right from the Sixties up to the present government's dithering on measures to cut traffic, transport observers argued. </p> <p>Politicians are primarily responsible for the chaos, they say, followed closely by gullible consumers devouring the myth of personal freedom without responsibility. </p> <p>Even now that a car-and-lorry-dependent nationis running on empty, it is still demanding that the orgy of cheap motoring, pollution and congestion be allowed to continue. </p> <p>For while the price of petrol at the pumps seems extortionate, and successive governments are certainly guilty of failing to invest motoring taxes in transport improvements, the cost of using cars and trucks in this country is still relatively cheap. </p> <p>Professor John Whitelegg of Liverpool John Moores University and a leading transport consultant told The Observer : 'The future has arrived early. What we are seeing is the inevitable consequence of pursuing a low fuel-priced economy for the last 30-odd years and putting all our eggs in the motorised transport basket.' </p> <p>Britain is the most road-de-pendent economy in Europe - for both passenger motoring and freight (see table below). </p> <p>Whitelegg says: 'Transport is a question of choice. What we have done in the UK - and I am stuck as to why we have been so stupid - is that we have not created a choice when we could have done; instead we exterminated it.' </p> <p>He blames first the Beeching cuts made between 1964 and 1970 - under which significant chunks of the passenger and freight rail network were closed - then the great motorway building programme. A third factor was bus deregulation in the mid-Eighties, which brought chaos and high prices, and drove 25 per cent of passengers away. </p> <p>'Areas where branch lines closed are now full of villages where people have two or three cars and are more or less dependent on them,' he says. The villagers cannot be blamed for having lost their rail services, or small companies for turning to lorries after finding they were no longer served by the single-wagon rail freight services wound down by British Rail. </p> <p>Gwyneth Dunwoody, chairman of the Parliamentary transport select committee, called for the Government to set up the kind of energy committee devised by Harold Wilson in the early Sixties to look at reducing dependency on fossil fuels by harnessing wave power and encouraging alternative-fuel vehicles. </p> <p>'If we had done many of the things that committee recommended, this small group of protesters would not have been able to hold the country to ransom,' she said. </p> <p>Stephen Joseph of lobby group Transport 2000 re-flected bitterly on the Conservatives' loosening of planning restrictions under environment secretary Nich-olas Ridley in the Eighties. This led to the out-of-town phenomenon and encour-aged urban sprawl and new towns in the green belt, all poorly served by deregulated bus operations. </p> <p>'Suddenly in the late Eighties there was a vast increase in the amount of mileage people did, with the growth of business parks and out-of-town shopping centres,' said Joseph, 'and the road-building programme added to it.' </p> <p>Notwithstanding recent rises in insurance, as well as petrol (see Cash), the real cost of private motoring has stayed more or less the same over the past 25 years, while average rail fares have risen by more than 50 per cent and bus fares by 80 per cent, he said. </p> <p>It is true that despite a big cut in road tax for large lorries in the last Budget, the tax disc for a 40-tonne truck in the UK is still \u00a33,950, whereas the next highest cost is in Sweden, at \u00a31,885; in France it is just \u00a3435. And it is also true that duty paid to the UK government on the price of diesel is more than twice as much as that paid in any other EU state. Buying a new lorry in Britain typically costs 20 per cent more than on the Continent. </p> <p>But Joseph pointed out that higher driver and social-tax costs for continental haul-age firms mean that 'taken in the round' the cost gap for British truckers is not as wide as it might appear. The Freight Transport As-sociation estimates that French truckers' operating costs are 5 per cent lower than in the UK; Belgians' costs are 3 per cent lower and Dutch costs are on a par. </p> <p>British hauliers are under competitive pressure from foreign truckers but factors such as road tolls and special truckers' taxes on the Continent plus the strength of the pound against the euro work to UK truckers' advantage. </p> <p>As one commentator said: 'Hardly a justification for bringing the country to a standstill over fuel duty.' Britain has been driven into this corner by its road dependency. </p> <p>Policies in the Eighties pandered to a natural desire for personal freedom. They centered on car and house ownership, on smashing the unions, the public sector and traditional industries. </p> <p>They worship the service sector and 'market forces'. But in many cases the ideal of flexibility and choice was an illusion. </p> <p>This applied increasingly to public transport. In terms of private motoring, the company car and road haulage, the freedom was real - but would be short-lived. By the early Nineties even the Conservatives acknowledged that building more roads just gen erated more traffic, congestion and pollution. Mean-while, decades of underinvestment in the railways had virtually become non-investment as North Sea oil revenues were squandered on tax cuts. The Channel Tunnel was a lone beacon in an increasingly bleak transport landscape - and Margaret Thatcher had wanted that to be a road tunnel. </p> <p>Where are the double-decker trains with modern signalling and safety systems? Where are the trams, cycle ways and buses that the Germans and Dutch take for granted? </p> <p>Whitelegg said: 'The paradox is that ideas that were sold on the basis of personal freedom would end up de-stroying choice. The dominance of the car feeds on itself: using a bicycle, a bus or walking becomes increasingly difficult.' The Commission for Integrated Transport (CFIT), set up to advise the Government, is critical of the way the balance has swung against public transport. It also strongly supports plans to introduce congestion charging and a levy on workplace parking to get people out of their cars. </p> <p>Professor David Begg, CFIT chairman, told The Observer he would not be convinced that the vast majority of motorists were really feeling the pain of high fuel costs until behaviour changed fundamentally - particularly in car-sharing for commuters. </p> <p>He called for a Europe-wide carbon tax to slow global warming and said he be-lieved in a policy of targeted taxes - congestion charging was a better tool than vehicle and fuel duty. But if last week's events have been decades in the making, to what extent is this Government at fault? </p> <p>In its three years in power, Labour has produced a transport White Paper and Bill aimed at introducing congestion charging and workplace parking taxes, with the revenue being 'ringfenced' for transport. </p> <p>It has strengthened regulation of the privatised railways and announced a 10-year public-private spending plan of \u00a3180 billion with public transport as top priority. </p> <p>It has scrapped the automatic inflation-plus fuel duty escalator and announced that discretionary rises above in-flation will be channelled into public transport. </p> <p>It will also revive some road schemes it shelved on taking power. But this is only a framework - little has changed for the better on the ground. </p> <p>The Government has failed to address the fact that the Treasury takes \u00a336 billion in taxes from the motorist a year but invests less than \u00a36bn back into transport.. </p> <p>Whitelegg concluded: 'The Government is now reaping the whirlwind of its own inaction and indecision, and it is a huge disappointment.'</p>",
  "<p>I decided to go to the Dome last weekend, to see what all the fuss was about. Or, rather, my wife decided to go, and one of the children said: 'stop grumbling about it'. </p> <p>The first thing to be said is that it is not a Dome: it is a tent. It is a dome-shaped tent. It is a kind of big top, ideal for a permanent circus (I am not referring to New Labour), with a small theme-park added on. But it is a theme-park without a theme. </p> <p>My grumble was that, on account of all the bad publicity, the place would be too crowded. It was a nice day, and it seemed pretty crowded. I was agreeably surprised by how nice it was outside, by the river, and by how much space there was for picnicking. The fairground atmosphere was quite fun. </p> <p>The 'show' was a great display of trapezes and acrobatics. Everybody seemed to be enjoying themselves, but my conclusion was that the organisers could only have achieved viable revenue figures by packing the place so much that they would have had a revolution on their hands. </p> <p>The theme of one area was the importance of the environment. One notice suggested that, if every car-owner in the country queued up for petrol at once, the pumps would run dry in about 20 minutes. </p> <p>I kept thinking of that notice all week, as the fuel protest got going and it was panic-stations at the filling stations. If the Tent's attendance figures were not large enough to provoke a revolution, there was certainly an odd sort of insurrection gathering outside. </p> <p>In common, I imagine, with many people, I was somewhat bemused by the way Tony Blair's little local difficulty with petrol protesters was reported and generally commented on. Words and phrases from the heavy industrial disputes of the 1970s and 1980s were used to describe demonstrations that appear to have been altogether more peaceful than the language implied. </p> <p>Many observers also seemed to miss the real point of what the oil companies were up to. The oil giants have spent years campaigning against higher taxes and duties on fuel. For them a peasants' revolt was just what the company doctor ordered. In the middle of the dispute, the Government issued statistics showing that the main reason for a benign inflation outcome in August was a fall in petrol prices - repeat, fall. </p> <p>What has been happening in the UK is intense price competition at the forecourt. Now the first law of business economics is that, however much they praise the virtues of competition, industrialists and businessmen don't like it. This competition at the retail end was squeezing the profit margins of the oil refineries. They wanted prices back up - as they indicated perhaps a little too hastily within minutes of the protesters' action being called off. The first law of all economics is that a sudden shortage doesn't half send prices up. </p> <p>It was fascinating to watch Labour's control freaks react to all this unexpected and unaccustomed pressure. (My Labour friends spent a lot of time on their summer holidays trying to think strategically, but they did not think of this one.) They could not react to undemocratic pressure; yet this was just the kind of populist pressure that seems a natural reaction to the world of television and presentational politics, in which Parliament - the very fount of the democratic process - has been treated with a certain contempt by Labour. </p> <p>Perhaps one of the good things to have come out of last week's events is that Labour has rediscovered the democratic process by which it was elected in the first place. Certainly, the word 'process' cropped up in all the television appearances by Blair's spokesmen - who tended, for some reason, to be nicely devolved secretaries of state for Scotland and Wales. </p> <p>A British prime minister could not give way weakly like, say, a French prime minister. But there was a Budget process. Implied in the voluntary cessation of the protest was the belief that there was an 'understanding' about the Government listening at Budget time. </p> <p>This was not an understanding that seemed to be shared by the Prime Minister's troublesome next-door neighbour, the King of Stealth Taxes, the Chancellor himself. The Chancellor went out of his way to indicate that he could not be pushed around like this. </p> <p>Stealth taxes are not what they were. The game of grandmother's footsteps has ended. Grandmother Brown has been rumbled. </p> <p>To be fair to the Chancellor, he resorted to stealth taxes - including increasing the rate at which fuel duties automatically rose in the Budget - only because Blair and the focus groups were not too keen on honest income taxes. It was the Economist that first reported that the resistance point had been reached on fuel duty; sure enough, while denying it at the time, the Treasury made clear in this year's Budget that the game was up. (Can this be the very same Economist that confidently told us a few years ago that world oil prices were going to fall to $5 a barrel and stay there? Ah well, win some, lose some.) </p> <p>As I pointed out last week, it is not wicked Opec but synchronised increases in world demand that have driven oil prices up. Simple economics suggests that if western governments were to cut fuel taxes, that would further increase the demand for fuel - and hence its price. The oil companies can't wait... </p> <p>Like the North Sea, these are deep waters.</p>",
  "I spent most of last week seized by a sense of the surreal. Two thousand desperate protesters bringing the country to the verge of collapse; the Confederation of British Industry, Institute of Directors and the Tory Party all appearing to condone the action, even as the TUC fulminated against it; most of the media disgracefully misrepresenting the facts about taxation in the UK and Europe; all but empty London streets through which it was a joy to cycle; and the environment movement relegated to the sidelines, incapable of mobilising to face the protesters down. <p>The most surreal thing of all was the apparently overwhelming support of UK citizens for the protest, notwithstanding the severe inconvenience. This led to one journalist to suggest to me that it was not just the worst week in office New Labour but 'the biggest setback for the environment movement since Michael Heseltine saw off your anti-nuclear campaigners at Greenham Common'. </p> <p>He may be right, but I rather doubt it. In fact, it may just turn out to be the most positive turning point for the environment since Mrs Thatcher saw the green light - briefly! - back in 1988. She declared at that time that climate change was 'the greatest single challenge we face between now and the end of the century'. Not exactly a perception that has much currency amongst current Ministers - even when we're talking about the twenty-first century. </p> <p>Whether it will be seen as the biggest setback or the most positive turning point depends on just one man - Tony Blair. As luck would have it, the 60 days he has been granted (with insufferable arrogance) by the protesters more or less coincides with the timing of the next international Climate Change Conference in The Hague in November. Between now and then the Government's position must be made crystal clear. And I've no doubt that Mr Blair's inner Cabinet is already reviewing the three options open to them. </p> <p>Option one is to capitulate completely to Mondeo Man; to signal some reduction in fuel taxes in the next Budget; to placate the road lobby with further soothing noises; and to renounce the leadership role that the UK has so adroitly played at previous climate change gatherings. </p> <p>Option two is to carry on as before, fudging around all over the place; making a few minor concessions and keeping fuel taxes where they are without making any effort to present the environmental case for them. In the meantime, Jack Straw will be whipping the reprehensible oil companies and supine police into a state of readiness to ensure that no such disruption occurs again. </p> <p>Option three is for Tony Blair and Gordon Brown to come out fighting in defence of their tax policies; to confront the protesters (and all those misguided enough to support them) with the kind of intellectual rigour and integrity that has been so woefully absent this week. He can then send John Prescott off to The Hague to spearhead international efforts to combat climate change on the basis of real leadership being shown here in the UK. </p> <p>Part of that case has already been made. In countering the intellectually bankrupt opportunism of Hague and Portillo, Ministers have successfully rebutted accusations that the UK is a high-tax country. In fact, in European Unity terms, we remain a low-tax country, with only Spain and Ireland taking a lower percentage of GDP in tax receipts. If people are serious in wanting improvements in our education and health services, there's mighty little room for any tax cutting. </p> <p>Gordon Brown could of course cut fuel taxes (from which we currently derive \u00a323 billion a year) and raise income tax or National Insurance to make up the difference. Even though there's no one better off, the protesters would be assuaged, and the Tories attack on the Government about 'stealth taxes' would be blunted. </p> <p>In every other respect, such a switch would be a disaster. The harsh unyielding reality for all politicians is that we have to start paying even more for coal, oil and gas, not less. Climate change is not some distant threat for the future; it is with us now. Prices must come to reflect the true cost of using those fossil fuels and their impact on the environment. We need higher prices to promote competitiveness in business, generate new revenues for investment in public transport, and drive innovation through new technology, greater fuel efficiency and alternative fuels. </p> <p>But there's the rub. Despite a few encouraging noises from the Treasury about the need to shift the burden of taxation from good things (employment, wealth creation) on to bad things (pollution, waste, inefficiency), the case for environmental taxes in general and fuel taxes in particular has never been properly made by Gordon Brown, let alone by Tony Blair. Rightly or wrongly, that has left people with the impression that the only reason for such taxes is to swell treasury coffers and stuff the environment. Not so much stealthy as downright cynical. </p> <p>We must add that to the reasons why the general public supported the protesters. Yes, they wanted to see the Government given another good kicking for a host of totally unrelated reasons - including the wretched Dome. Yes, they wanted to punish the Government for its perceived arrogance and 'out of touchness'. But they've also been given no opportunity whatsoever to understand why fuel taxes are such an effective way of meeting key environmental objectives as well as raising revenue. </p> <p>That's the case the Prime Minister must now make. Until now, there has been a chronic leadership deficiency on this issue. While all the best qualities of Tony Blair as a leader eventually came to the fore at the end of the week, he still couldn't quite bring himself to utter the dreaded E-word, fearing that too much environmental concern on his part would further alienate truckers, farmers and the rest of the right-wing rag-bag that lurked behind the protesters. </p> <p>Take them on, Tony! If there are legitimate grievances as a consequence of higher fuel prices (owing more to Opec, incidentally, than to this Government) then deal with those grievances by other means rather than caving in on the principles. Look again, for instance, at Vehicle Excise Duty to help low-income motorists in rural areas - or even abolish VED altogether on cars below a certain size. Provide grants for truckers to convert to cleaner, cheaper fuels such as LPG. Increase the level of support for rural bus services. Hypothecate some of the revenue from fuel taxes for local projects like Safe Routes to School, cycle paths and so on. </p> <p>Such creativity only becomes possible if both the necessity and the desirability of higher fuel taxes are patiently but robustly presented by Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, John Prescott and all the rest of the pale green Government. If they back down now, give in (again) to the road lobby, it will indeed be a massive defeat for responsible, progressive politics. </p> <p>But at least they'll save themselves a few airfares to The Hague - and the resulting carbon dioxide emission. For there would be little point sending anyone to this crucial climate change conference, where representatives of more than enough backsliding and cowardly governments will already be gathered.</p>"
