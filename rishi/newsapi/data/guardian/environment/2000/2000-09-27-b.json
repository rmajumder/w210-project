  "<p>Limbering up in preparation for a training session she's giving in \"non-violent direct action\" at a temporary camp of protesters outside Prague, Starhawk says: \"I almost feel like you have to give people a course in economics before they can join in the protest.\" </p> <p>The spiritualist and lifestyle expert from San Francisco has spent a large part of her summer in the Czech capital, working with members of Inpeg, the Initiative Against Economic Globalisation, an umbrella group of anti-globalisation protesters who are in town for the International Monetary Fund/World Bank annual meetings. </p> <p>\"The issues are complex and the media is mostly set up to deal with things in a very simple way,\" says Starhawk, a new age \"witch\". \"We haven't wanted to reduce the complexity to a simple soundbite.\" </p> <p>Then there is the added complication that post-communist countries are unused to direct action, or the concept of \"civil society\". A lot of people from the region are just not keen to get involved, having been scared off by media reports telling them to barricade their doors against barbarian protesters from the west. </p> <p>Cue Juraj Zamkovsky. He's the chairman of the Centre for Environment and Public Advocacy (Cepa), whose office is tucked away in the unlikely location of the Polana mountains in Ponicka Huta, a village of 300 in central Slovakia. The NGO is a founding member of the group's Central and Eastern Europe Bankwatch (Ceeb) network and part of Friends of the Earth Slovakia. Ceeb was set up in 1993 to train people how to challenge international financial institutions. </p> <p>Zamkovsky and a few co-workers monitored several projects in order to help the average Slovak fight against what Cepa see as unsustainable project loans. \"We hope that through the example of Prague 2000, Czechs and Slovaks will realise that it's their right to protest,\" he adds. </p> <p>Projects have included a successful campaign against a World Bank loan for logging in Slovakia - an activity which in the past few decades has caused Slovakia to lose much of its 300-year-old primary forest. After that came a project to challenge the World Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (Cas) which Cepa believed failed to encourage the fostering of a sustainable economy for the country. It also provided legal support for the village of Dubakova to overturn a ban on local development of a major dam. </p> <p>Otherwise it has spent much time investigating the activities in the region of the IMF, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the European Investment Bank. Its challenge now, starting with this month's summit, says Zamkovsky, is to make the IMF less secretive and more accountable, and to nurture what he calls a genuine \"public participation process\". </p> <p>There is disillusionment with transition and the implementation of IMF recommendations is blamed for the fact that the Czech Republic's GDP is still below 1989 levels leading to a growing band of anti-capitalists. The story is the same in most transition countries. Of the 19 only Poland's GDP has risen above 1989 levels. </p> <p>\"The trouble is, people at these financial institutions have been making decisions about countries they know nothing about,\" says Ceeb's Poland-based president, Tomas Terlecki. </p> <p>This week's meeting, Inpeg has been trying to deliver their campaign message to the Czech public in a non-violent manner, through a \"counter summit\" running simultaneously with the bankers' meeting. \"Much street theatre is being planned to draw the Czechs who are traditionally very passive,\" says Chelsea Mozen, international spokeswoman for Inpeg. </p> <p>But organisations are realising how difficult it is to stand up and be heard. Hundreds of people have been turned back at the borders because, border police admitted, \"they looked like protesters\". </p> <p>Ceeb has had experience in dealing with attempts to silence their dissenting voice, according to a recent report by the Mott Foundation - a privately-endowed US foundation that supports civil society development in central and eastern Europe and Russia. </p> <p>The head of Friends of the Earth, Latvia was arrested in Riga in April this year for wanting to participate in an Ebrd meeting on the financing of nuclear fuel. Ceeb had to intervene to secure his release. </p> <p>Two years ago, Ukrainian police arrested activists from Rainbow Keepers, days before the Ebrd was due to hold meetings in Kiev. Others were jailed for handing out leaflets. </p> <p>Meanwhile back at the training camp, Starhawk is explaining the techniques of \"hassle lines\" and \"consensus circles\". \"Our approach is non-hierarchical, participatory, alive and inventive,\" she says. \"It encourages people to take actions that are meaningful in their own lives.\" </p> <p>Says Zamkovsky: \"People are too afraid to speak out, because of the totalitarian past. The biggest challenge is not so much the bank as making ordinary people realise they can win the battles.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong> Damage limitation</strong><br> </p> <p> Amid tears and cheers at Norwich crown court, the Greenpeace 28 walked free last week, after a jury decided that they had \"lawful excuse\" for weighing into that field of GM maize. Where this leaves the crown prosecution service, which decides where court cases are heard, is debatable. After a string of high profile jury acquittals of \"ethical\" protesters, it now has a problem finding anyone willing to convict GM, anti-arms trade, human rights and nuclear protesters. The likelihood now is that this kind of case will henceforth be confined to magistrates courts - where a conviction is more likely. Witness last week, when seven GM demonstrators in Weymouth, Dorset, had criminal damage charges dropped and replaced with aggravated trespass following their attack on GM crops. Moreover, criminal damage charges can only go before a jury if more than \u00a35,000 of damage is caused, a point not lost on solicitors acting for 11 GM protesters accused of damaging a crop in Essex who are trying to show that they caused at least that much damage. </p> <p><strong> Low profile</strong><br> </p> <p> Still with dynamite court cases, November sees the fifth anniversary of the hanging of the Ogoni writer Ken Saro-Wiwa by Nigeria's Abacha regime and the publication of his son Ken Wiwa's book about the affair. Shell will be keeping its head down ahead of the massive court case being mounted in the US by young Ken and other Ogonis. They accuse Shell and its Nigerian subsidiary of aiding and abetting in the torture and murder of Saro-Wiwa senior and other Ogonis, of taking land for oil development without adequate compensation and polluting air and water in Ogoniland and of recruiting the Nigerian police and military to attack local villages. Shell denies the charges but last week a federal appeal court decided the case could go ahead in New York, rather than London where it was less likely to reach the courts. </p> <p><strong> Wildlife wisdom</strong><br> </p> <p> The WWF started life 50 years ago wilfully ignoring people in its mission to save wildlife and was constantly bashed by environmentalists and others who argued that it could not conceivably succeed because animals were vulnerable as long as people were in poverty and environments were in decline. How far it has come in 50 years can be seen in its latest \"campaign\", called People and the planet. The WWF now spends 50% of its budget on human poverty alleviation, it says, and indeed is the only environment group to get a block grant from the Department for International Development.</p>",
  "<p>On day three of the petrol crisis, shops in the Welsh town of Machynlleth ran out of milk. Paul Allen looked out of his window at a dairy farm in the middle distance and wondered if the farmer could help. No luck. The farmer had nothing so old-fashioned as a milk churn. </p> <p>Allen was understandably quick to draw conclusions: he is development director at the Centre for Alternative Technology (Cat). \"We've lost our ability to handle local goods. The supermarket gets milk from 300 miles away; this crisis reminds us we must stop moving food around so much.\" </p> <p>That day the Cat's staff were drinking more beer than milk - celebrating a 25-year history in which it grew from a tiny community of optimists trying to live sustainably in an abandoned slate quarry into one of the world's leading centres of information, research and demonstration of the technologies that can deliver us from the tyranny of fossil energy. And now there is a new proposal to make the centre into \"an authoritative body with freedom to speak out on the misuse of power by multinationals and on the iniquities of globalisation, and to initiate processes of change\". </p> <p>The quarry near Machynlleth has been transformed into a wonderland where you can learn more and have more fun than in the Dome. You arrive in a vertiginous cliff railway powered by water; pee in a recycling loo; call home from a solar-powered telephone; generate your own wave-power; feed farm animals that live almost entirely on kitchen wastes; go down a \"mole hole\" for a worm's eye view of soil; learn how to build your own sustainable house or grow lots of organic food in a tiny space. </p> <p>More than 70,000 adults and children a year visit this unpretentious adventure playground where technical stuff is explained in homely language. Entry for the whole day costs \u00a36.90 - with 50% off if you come on foot or on a bike. Every day telephone inquiries come in from people trying to grow, build and generate power sustainably. Inquiries are processed in a new information centre with walls and supporting pillars made of rammed earth and insulation made of Welsh wool. </p> <p>In the beginning \"the quarry was like a jungle scattered with ruinous buildings from which birch trees grew in profusion. My search for such a site had brought me to this beautiful and private place\", says Gerard Morgan-Grenville. He had the feeling that \"here something new, some fresh and saner way of living might be demonstrated\". Morgan-Grenville, an egregious Old Etonian businessman, then aged 45, had studied American hippies trying out sustainable technologies. \"They were mostly muddled and disorganised, fragile. Most failed, but the important thing was that they had opted out of mainstream life in order to find a way of living which respected the environment in which they lived. They also rejected authority on principle. I found myself in sympathy with both aims.\" </p> <p>The original settlers at the quarry found their project exciting for technological solutions but disastrous economically: they were soon broke. Worse, they were bothered by a stream of visitors endlessly asking the same questions. In their first exercise in turning a problem into a solution, they decided to create an exhibition with explanatory signs, and to charge an entry fee. </p> <p> The following years were pragmatic and experimental. \"First we had the string-and-sealing-wax phase when we put up a Cretan windmill made of bits of wood and recycled car parts,\" said Peter Harper, one of the early settlers who is now head of biology and Cat's best-known spokesperson. \"Then came the craft phase - everything made by hand, even our shoes. Then the ferro cement phase - everything made of chicken wire and mortar. Then the heroic-bits-of-kit phase - a wood-gas generator wreathed in curling pipes with a huge silver retort. Now the economics have changed; there's more money to spend and we can look at costly things like photovoltaic roofs.\" </p> <p>Cat has a turnover of \u00a32m and is run by a co-operative of 40 members in which everyone is equal and on the same salary. Paul Allen says the demand for its services has evolved. \"Now it's more of a public policy agenda with organisations like the Welsh National Assembly wanting our help on using sustainable resources. But there are still individuals asking how to re-cycle used chip-fat oil or compost dog poo.\" </p> <p>Allen said the latest report of the royal commission on environmental pollution calling for a 60% reduction over the next 50 years in the UK's carbon dioxide emissions through burning fossil fuels had given fresh impetus to the search for sustainability, and now the petrol crisis \"will set people thinking faster\". </p> <p>Meanwhile do-it-yourself environmentalists can telephone to access Cat's database, call up the website at <a href=\"http://www.cat.org.uk\">www.cat.org.uk</a>, or order publications ranging from a tip sheet on organic ways of combating slugs (40p) or a factsheet on environmental building and water power systems (\u00a32), to a New Futures book on designing a compost toilet (\u00a312). Cat can send you a consultant to build your own house, install solar, wind or water power or set up an environmental exhibition in your museum. </p> <p>Morgan-Grenville, now 70, is still innovating. He is setting up a new network of sustainable communities in the West country. Guest of honour at Cat's 25th anniversary party earlier this month he said it was time to move on. \"In the seventies we aimed to attract attention to the environmental crisis. Since then there's been a seismic shift in the reception of that message but now other problems have loomed and Cat should be at the heart of the solution.\" </p> <p>He said most people still do not realise the extent of the looming global disaster. \"They still assume free trade is a good thing. There's huge public education to be done. I want a centre within the centre - a substantial building with a spiral walkway with bays framing photos and videoclips proffering solutions. We need an authoritative body with freedom to speak out, to tackle the controversial issues and initiate process of change. We're the best qualified body to demonstrate how we could have a better quality of life without ripping off the poor and the planet itself.\" </p> <p>Morgan-Grenville believes Cat could get funding for a new centre that would put pressure on corporations by appealing to shareholders. He feels the new Earth Centre near Doncaster is \"a theme park lacking a coherent message\" while neither Greenpeace nor Friends of the Earth offer a centre where anyone can go to learn. If Morgan-Grenville can sell his latest innovation to Paul Allen, Peter Harper and other members of the co-operative, the Cat saga will only have begun. </p> <p> \u0095 Cat is at Machynlleth, Powys SY20 9AZ; tel: 01654-702400.

  "<p>Web agencies have reached maturity and financial stability, according to a survey by trade title New Media Age.</p> <p>The combined turnover of the top 100 web agencies is now around \u00a3456.5m, of which 9% report an individual turnover of more than \u00a39m. </p> <p>Independents are gradually being squeezed out of the market by the big global networks, which account for 50% of the top 100 UK web agencies. But thankfully the top two agencies are both independents, for the time being at least.</p> <p>AKQA sits at the top of the pile with an annual turnover of \u00a321m, I-level comes in second with \u00a319.9m, while the combined force of PrimeCom-owned Pres.co/Foresight (which merged recently) puts it at number three, with \u00a317.42m.</p> <p>The rest of the top 10 comprises Hyperlink (\u00a316m, independent), Tribal DDB UK (\u00a314m, DDB Worldwide), Modem Media (\u00a313.2m, True North), Oyster Partners (\u00a312.6m, OmniCom), Zinc (\u00a310m, Havas), Oasis Communications (\u00a39m, independent) and Ehsrealtime (\u00a38.9m, Havas). </p> <p>Elen Lewis, features editor at New Media Age, said: \"Over the last two years, the industry has come of age and, very importantly, it has lost the cowboy image which it had in its early days. </p> <p>\"The companies represented are taken seriously by the wider media and business community, and the involvement of the large UK and US agency networks signals how important new media has become in the overall mix.\"</p>",
  "Mr Blunkett began by highlighting a number of important programmes which had been developed since 1997, including Sure Start, literacy and numeracy, the childcare strategy, progress on class sizes and excellence in cities. <p> He then turned to nursery education and primary school improvements. \"With the Tories, there was no commitment to providing more free nursery places. Yet since 1997, we have already provided 120,000 more free places. </p> <p> \"We have introduced Sure Start to give every child a chance of a flying start with \u00a3540m invested directly to overcome generational disadvantage </p> <p> \"We have put childcare at the top of the agenda. More new places in 18 months than in the 18 years of the Tory government - helping 140,000 more children in the last year alone. </p> <p> \"We already have a nursery place for every 4 year old. Today, I can announce for the first time that we will by September 2004 have a nursery place for every three year old whose parents wish it. </p> <p> \"It is of course up to parents of under-fives to decide what they think best for their children, and they may choose not to take a nursery or playgroup place. </p> <p> \"But we are making this investment because we want formal nursery education, from three onwards, to become as much a part of bringing up children as primary and secondary school are today. </p> <p> \"I appeal to parents to take their responsibilities seriously and think what is best for their child - what will help them best begin the process of learning and play, and how important it is for them to arrive at primary school with the confidence and social skills needed to make a good start. </p> <p> \"Education is a partnership in which parents have a critical role. We want them to engage much more in the education of their children than in the past. Their children need it. It can make a huge difference. </p> <p> \"And with the investment we are now making in universal under-five provision, there is no longer any need to wait until five or even four before building the partnership between parents and teachers which is so crucial to a child's success. </p> <p> \"But, conference, don't forget that if the Tories were in office, none of this would happen, because they would cut spending on education. For 10 years, class size rose and pupil/teacher ratio worsened and what did they do about it - absolutely nothing. </p> <p> \"And what have we done? At least 300,000 infants are already in lower class sizes and we expect this term that fewer than 50,000 will be in classes of over 30. That compares with nearly 500,000 left by the Tories - and we will meet our target. </p> <p> \"What is more we have cut class sizes for 7-11 year olds too and reduced pupil/teacher ratios at primary level. There are also more classroom assistants than ever to help teachers out. </p> <p> \"And we have given heads in secondary schools the direct cash to employ the teachers and assistants they need to do the job - if they wish to employ more teachers they can do so. </p> <p> \"It is no accident that there are nearly 7,000 more teachers in our schools this year than there were two years ago. </p> <p> \"Lower infant class sizes come alongside real improvements in literacy and numeracy. In two years, literacy up 10 points, numeracy up 13 points. </p> <p> \"That's a real tribute to our pupils and teachers. </p> <p> \"But it's also the result of investing in training, materials and back up support. The Tories opposed the literacy and numeracy hours when we took the difficult decisions. </p> <p> \"Now they want to stop spending on training and books to back it up. They would sack those who have delivered success. The Tories would kill the literacy and numeracy hours if they were ever given the chance.\" </p> <p> Mr Blunkett continued by talking about the importance of modernising comprehensive education </p> <p> \"We're working on the biggest programme of urban school improvement in generations. </p> <p> \"Excellence in cities is central to raising standards in the most disadvantaged areas. It helps teachers teach with on-site welfare officers. It supports bright pupils with programmes for gifted and talented children. There is targeted help in special zones. </p> <p> \"And there's more support than ever before to improve school discipline, with learning and support units in school as well as a big increase in teachers and places in pupil referral units out of school </p> <p> \"Taken together with practical support to back headteachers, this ensures that they can take disruptive children out of the classroom but keep them off the streets. </p> <p> \"We're improving the career structure for teachers, rewarding good teaching and have introduced training salaries to boost recruitment. </p> <p> \"With a new General Teaching Council, teachers now have a body to promote their profession. </p> <p> \"We have already opened more than 300 new specialist schools - comprehensive schools getting better than average improvements in GCSE results. </p> <p> \"With the announcement by the prime minister yesterday, we will increase the number from just over 500 this term to 1,000 by 2004. </p> <p> \"And look how we've computerised our schools too. Over 20,000 schools connected to the internet this year compared with 6,500 two years ago. </p> <p> \"That's putting modernisation into practice. We're building the schools of the future, where the needs of every child are met and the talents of every child are fully developed. </p> <p> \"Schools where there is the support and the equipment to do the job. </p> <p> \"An education system where children learn the basics and are therefore able to access the wider curriculum. </p> <p> \"One where we've given parents a greater voice than ever before - and opened up the curriculum to them in ways no government has ever previously done. </p> <p> \"Where schools have been failing, we've taken action. Over 500 failing schools have come off special measures since 1997. Others have closed or been given a fresh start. Sometimes we do need to do more - because turning around a failing school is never easy. </p> <p> \"City academies will offer new hope too where inner city schools have been failing. </p> <p> \"But it now takes 18 months on average where it took 25 months under the Tories to turn around a failing school.\" </p> <p> Mr Blunkett turned to spending on schools </p> <p> \"Conference, we've been getting more money to schools. We've got a billion pounds extra direct to heads and will do more with fair funding in the future. And with direct grants of up to \u00a370,000 as well, heads have much more freedom under labour to deliver at the frontline - and that drive goes on. </p> <p> \"We're doing it while spending per pupil rises. \u00a3300 more per pupil since the election after years of Tory cuts. A further \u00a3370 by 2003. </p> <p> \"But we also recognise that there are things which an education authority has to provide. Special needs. Educating excluded children. School improvement and school transport. </p> <p> \"Let people be in no doubt what William Hague and the Tories are committed to do. Not only do they pretend you don't need to pay for these services, they are quite clear that they would abolish school buses. They would scrap them in rural areas. They would scrap them for children with special needs. </p> <p> \"It sounds like the sort of policy that you would need to have consumed 14 pints to come up with.\" </p> <p> Mr Blunkett promised a big increase in capital spending on schools: </p> <p> \"We have been tackling directly years of neglect - the New Deal for Schools is the most effective programme in decades, it is transforming the environment in which teachers teach and students learn. </p> <p> \"Again, as part of the \u00a316bn cutback pledged by the Tories, school investment would go, renewal and refurbishment would go, and of course, the investment in technology announced by the prime minister yesterday would certainly go. </p> <p> \"The difference is we are equipping our nation for a world of tomorrow. We are modernising and reforming for a purpose. </p> <p> \"Our job is to ensure that every school is a good school - that the roof doesn't leak, that the heating works, that the children are warm. That temporary classrooms are replaced, that schools are refurbished. </p> <p> \"11,000 schools have already benefited and, Conference, today I am able to announce from the Spending Review the decisions we have taken on capital investment for the future. \"Four years ago, the Tories were spending less than \u00a3700m a year on capital. </p> <p> \"This year, we're spending over \u00a32bn. </p> <p> \"In three years time, I can announce today, this will increase to over \u00a33bn a year as part of an investment programme of nearly \u00a38bn between next year and 2003.\" </p> <p> Mr Blunkett went on to highlight the successes of the New Deal for the Unemployed, which has helped 230,000 long-term unemployed young people to find jobs. </p> <p> He then announced plans for a big increase in the programme to improve the skills of adults who cannot read or do basic maths. </p> <p> \"We inherited a scandal - millions of people unable effectively to read, write or add up - to read a bus timetable or to understand many household bills </p> <p> \"That was the legacy of poor teaching of the basics which our literacy and numeracy strategies are now beginning to put right. Those who didn't gain these skills haven't succeeded at work as well as they could. </p> <p> \"So I can announce to conference today that we will have a new national Basic Skills Strategy, backed by at least \u00a3150m more spending. </p> <p> \"This will be a critical second term priority for us. Lifelong learning is more than a slogan: we are making it a reality, starting with those who missed out first time around. </p> <p> \"There'll be more money for literacy, numeracy and computer skills. More for teachers of basic skills. More for books - and a new curriculum. </p> <p> \"With a network of 6,000 learning centres being developed nationally, we can ensure that people have access to learning wherever they are.\" </p> <p> Mr Blunkett concluded by highlighting increased investment in further and higher education, including the three-year \u00a3150m package to improve opportunities for bright state school pupils to go to university.</p>",

The Staffordshire company was <a href=\"http://pages.zoom.co.uk/elvis/body_reliant.html\" target=\"_new\">rescued from near-oblivion </a> in 1997 by Jersey-based financier Kevin Leech, a Robin nutter. </p> <p> 3. Oddly enough, the Robin has become a victim of revamped Reliant's success. Much of its new prosperity now rests on the import and distribution of foreign rivals such as the <a href=\"http://www.reliant-zone.org.uk/Ambra.html\" target=\"_new\">Ligier Ambra</a>, which at \u00a36,500 costs around two thirds as much as the preposterously expensive Robin. </p> <p> 4. The Robin, essentially a survivor of <a href=\"http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/motorpost/review/car_reviews/relient/trotters.html\" target=\"_new\">the bubblecar era</a>, has become almost the generic name for triangular motors. In fact, the first Robin tottered off the assembly line in 1973. But Reliant has been making <a href=\"http://www.bondbug.co.uk/rnn/stories.html\" target=\"_new\">newsworthy three-wheelers</a> since 1935, some of them rather snazzy, for example the <a href=\"http://pages.zoom.co.uk/elvis/body_bbug.html\" target=\"_new\">Bond Bug</a>. </p> <p> 5. The <a href=\"http://www.reliant-motors.co.uk/pressr.htm\" target=\"_new\"> latest and last Robin</a> is a tarted-up model called BRG, for British Racing Green. As the name implies, in comes in green. Or blue. </p> <p> 6. The company will replace the Robin with a four-wheel car, as yet unnamed. It will feature the glass-fibre bodyshell which has lent all Reliants the affectionate nickname of <a href=\"http://www.digital-brilliance.com/bikes/reliant.htm\" target=\"_new\"> Plastic Pigs</a>. </p> <p> 7. Reliant knows how to make cars with a wheel at each corner. In the 60s it produced the elegant <a href=\"http://www.scimweb.com/\" target=\"_new\">Scimitar </a> and Sabre sports cars, and also <a href=\"http://www.uk-classic-cars.com/kitten.htm\" target=\"_new\">the Kitten</a>, a four-wheeled version of the Robin. </p> <p> 8. <a href=\"http://www.mg.co.za/mg/features/drive/drivefeatures/2000/20mar-reliantro bin.html\" target=\"_new\">Motoring correspondents</a> loathe the poor little Robin. Owners tend to <a href=\"http://www.reliant-zone.org.uk/\" target=\"_new\"> love them to bits</a>. Fans of <a href=\"http://welcome.to/ReliantRobins/\" target=\"_new\">Bristol City</a> football club call themselves the Reliant Robins (not many people know that). The car is something of a cult in Vienna, and there's even an <a href=\"http://www.microcars.cc/reliantclub.htm\" target=\"_new\">owners' club</a> in America. It has eight members. That might surprise <a href=\"http://www.bratcity.com/robin/index.html\" target=\"_new\">the bloke in the Midwest</a> who believes he's the only Reliant owner in the land, or the chap who wants to restore the full glory of his Robin with <a href=\"http://www.morecambe.co.uk/sticker.html\" target=\"_new\">a very special sticker</a>. </p> <p> 9. Reliants tend to encourage owners' instincts to make improvements. There is an <a href=\"http://www.lynchmotor.com/221.401.htm\" target=\"_new\">electric version</a> with a range of 50 miles.

  "<p>The government's NHS plan has promised us thousands more health professionals, not only to overcome staff shortages faced in many areas but also to expand provision through extra hospital and intermediate care beds, GP surgeries and nurse-led, walk-in centres. </p> <p>All of this is excellent news. But there is one small problem. All the extra money and all the promises on paper will make no difference unless thousands of willing people decide to work for the NHS. </p> <p>Skilled people are the single most important resource for any health service. At present, they are also the most scarce - and the prospects of keeping them are not good. Growing proportions of nurses and inner-city GPs are nearing retirement age. Many more health workers are moving into the private sector, or to job opportunities outside the health system, and are not being replaced by sufficient new recruits. </p> <p>A recent King's Fund report, The Last Straw, found that NHS nurses were unhappy about poor pay, bleak conditions and chronic shortages of basic resources that they experience on a daily basis. They were frustrated by inflexible working arrangements, limited career development opportunities and lack of control over their working environment. Racist harassment and discrimination were also strongly in evidence. The implications of these findings for the recruitment and retention of health workers are considerable. </p> <p>There is a wider issue here, too, which should be of concern to anyone who works for, or with, the public sector. The concept of public service, which in recent history has been a source of pride and commitment, has gradually fallen into disrepute. Ambitious young people, leaving schools and universities, no longer see public service as the height of personal achievement. Instead, it is associated with ponderous bureaucracy, political manipulation, poor opportunities and low pay. </p> <p>If the government wants to succeed with its NHS plan, it must make public service seem worthwhile to a wider group of people. Ministers must show they value public sector workers, not just by saying so, but by demonstrating their commitment in practice. They must provide bigger pay packets, better (and broader) career opportunities, more flexible working arrangements and much more of a chance for workers at all levels to influence how services are run. </p> <p>The concept of public service, wrapped up in the values of another century, looks dated. The challenge for ministers is to build a new vision of public service that harnesses the values of equity and altruism, as well as chiming with the personal goals of the kinds of people the state needs to get to work for it - and for all of us.</p> <p>\u0095 Rabbi Julia Neuberger is chief executive of the King's Fund health policy institute.</p>",

  "Libya's oil minister yesterday warned that Opec would be forced to cut its oil output if the price of petroleum dropped as a result of a US move to release emergency supplies. <p>As ministers arrived in Caracas for the first Opec summit in 25 years, the Libyan oil minister, Abdullah el-Badri, said: \"I hope this decision [by the US] doesn't shrink the price too much and we are forced to cut production.\" </p> <p>Algeria's energy and mining minister, Chakib Khelil, also warned: \"There is a good chance we will have to [cut output]. There will be declining demand in the second quarter of 2001 and with stocks rising there won't be strong demand for Opec crude.\" </p> <p>Opec - which controls two-thirds of world crude exports - has achieved a new relevance amid the greatest oil boom since the 1980s and protests throughout Europe at pump prices. </p> <p>Although Ali Rodriguez, Venezuela's oil minister and Opec president, believes that prices will stabilise at a \"fair\" $25 a barrel, the cartel does not agree with the Group of Seven leading industrialised countries, which favour increased production as a solution to consumer pressure, instead of a cut in petrol taxes. </p> <p>Opec's new-found confidence is a dramatic turnaround from two years ago, when oil prices sank to $10 a barrel and the cartel was mired in bickering over quota busting. Now - thanks in part to Venezuela's ebullient leader, Hugo Chavez - Opec is returning to the influence it wielded in the 1970s and 80s. </p> <p>Mr Chavez has worked tirelessly to remodel the cartel into a consumer-friendly advocacy group. In August he toured all the Opec countries. </p> <p>On Monday night, Mr Chavez gave a televised address to the country, full of his typical revolutionary rhetoric, saying that the industrialised world had grown rich on the cheap oil from producing countries. </p> <p>\"This reunion isn't only about oil,\" he said, referring to the two-day summit which begins today. Opec would also focus on global poverty, foreign debts and unfair terms of trade for developing countries in their search \"for a more just world\", he said. </p> <p>Industrialised countries which were flush with cheap oil a few years ago are now demanding that Opec acts to stabilise a gyrating market that has seen oil prices reach 10-year highs and prompted protests in Europe. </p> <p>Opec's secretary general, Ril wanu Lukman of Nigeria, said cartel members were surprised by the industrialised countries' refusal in Prague to cut oil taxes. Opec views such taxes - along with free market speculators and hindrances in refining - as the real cause of high prices. </p> <p>Since his election in 1998, Mr Chavez has seized the stage at opportune moments to cajole fellow leaders of developing countries to unite and confront the perils of globalisation. When oil prices fell in 1998, Venezuela plunged into a devastating recession it is still struggling to escape from. Unemployment is officially 15%, while some 80% of its 23m people live in poverty. </p> <p>Mr Chavez said on Monday that his government was following in the footsteps of the late Juan Pablo Perez Alfonzo, a Venezuelan energy minister who was a founding father of Opec in 1960 and helped break the stranglehold of foreign oil companies on oil-producing countries. </p> <p>\"And now, Opec has arisen again,\" Mr Chavez said.</p>",
  "<p>It was business as usual on both sides of the barricades in Prague yesterday. Out in the streets there was the clatter of teargas rounds being fired, the whoosh of water cannons and the injured being carted off in ambulances. In the conference centre, where one of eastern Europe's nastiest communist parties used to meet in conclave, Horst Kohler of the International Monetary Fund and James Wolfensohn of the World Bank were applauded politely as they talked of the challenges ahead for globalisation. </p> <p>Kohler quoted Karl Popper as he talked of how his vision was for the IMF to make the world \"a little better\". Wolfensohn said he \"shared the passion\" of the protesters, and in a series of bullet points expressed views that the protesters themselves make - that there is something wrong about a world where the richest 20% of the world's population receive more than 80% of global incomes, where 1.2bn people live on less than a dollar a day and where the average income in the wealthiest countries is 37 times that in the poorest 20. </p> <p>Wolfensohn and Kohler cannot understand why they remain figures of hate when they have changed their message and now talk the language of fairness and inclusion. </p> <p>They hold seminars with debt campaigners, they fund bio-diversity programmes, they accept that there can be dangers from liberalising capital flows too rapidly. And yet they - and the institutions they head - are still loathed by the protesters, who see the fund and the bank as part of the problem rather than part of the solution. The problem being, of course, globalisation. </p> <p>As far as the protesters advocating direct and violent action are concerned, it is clear that crunch time is fast approaching. They need to think hard about what to do next, because demonstration fatigue is already setting in. </p> <p>The street riots in Seattle were effective not only because they had a novelty value but because they appeared to cause the collapse of attempts to launch a new round of trade talks. In fact, while there was a lot of sound and fury on the streets, the real problem was inside the conference centre, where the poor countries refused to be rolled over by the United States. Had the European Union and the United States been able to persuade a few of the bigger developing countries to come on board, there would have been a deal in Seattle, protests or not. </p> <p>Neither the protests at the spring meetings of the bank and fund in April, nor those intended to disrupt the annual meetings in Prague, have had the same impact. </p> <p>The demonstrators have not been able to stop the meetings from taking place, let alone achieve their wider objective of rolling back globalisation. Far from it. According to the fund's forecasts, global capitalism is enjoying its best year of growth for more than a decade. All the laptops and mobile phones that have been bought by the demonstrators to coordinate their protests are doing wonders for the profits of Microsoft, Intel and Nokia. </p> <p>Yet from one perspective, the current state of the global economy is a total irrelevance. Globalisation, it is said, will be brought down by its own internal contradictions, just as Marx predicted more than a century ago, and direct action will be the handmaiden of the revolution. </p> <p> This is a perfectly acceptable view of the world, and it may even be right. It has to be said, however, that industrial capitalism has proved to be a far more durable opponent than its enemies have expected. It also needs to be acknowledged that direct action is something of a double-edged sword, which can be used by the forces of reaction - as in the recent fuel protests in Britain - as well as by the forces of progress. </p> <p>History suggests that protest groups only turn into successful mass movements when they tap into widespread discontent and offer a feasible alternative. So far, there is no real evidence that the anti-globalisation protesters have achieved either. \"I know what they are against,\" said Trevor Manuel, the finance minister of South Africa, yesterday. \"But I don't know what they are for.\" </p> <p>This, then, is the dilemma for the anti-globalisation protests. Their action has been a limited success to the extent that it has forced many of the problems of globalisation - the inequity, the instability of the financial system, the threat to the environment, the importance of human rights - higher up the political agenda at a time when the failures of neo- liberalism and the financial crises of the late 90s were already contributing to a mood in which those at the apex of globalisation are willing to talk and debate the need for reform. But Seattle, Washington and now Prague have certainly concentrated minds and created space for the moderate wing of anti-globalisation to push for more generous debt relief and universal primary education. </p> <p>But dialogue and debate do not provide the same buzz, the same instant gratification, as chucking a Molotov cocktail or throwing a smokebomb. If you're an idealistic student, the idea of cutting a deal with Jim Wolfensohn is far less attractive than calling him a fascist or a mass murderer. Jim Morrison of the Doors used to send his audience wild with ecstasy in the 60s when he bellowed \"We want the world and we want it now\", and, in truth, little has changed since. The grotesque imbalances - in both power and wealth - that have become ever more apparent as globalisation has developed makes the desire for instant results understandable. Foot-dragging on debt relief is costing lives in Africa every day. </p> <p>The alternative to violent action is a hard slog, to persuade rich countries to speed up debt relief, to give smaller countries a bigger say in the running of the fund and the bank, to campaign for a world environment organisation with the same clout as that wielded by the world trade organisation, and to make the case for new controls on global capital. </p> <p>But this will be messy, because the democratic route is always messy. Those who advocate it can be accused of lacking ideological purity or of lacking the stomach for a fight. What's more, their way may not work either. </p> <p>Yet the experience of the 60s protests is instructive. As today, they emerged from a period in which the global economy - and the American economy in particular - was doing well. The desire to protest diminished when times got tough, and instead of 20 years of togetherness following a revolutionary golden dawn, we got 20 years of Thatcherism instead. </p> <p>In the meantime, once the leaders of the 60s generation realised that capitalism was not about to collapse, they found a job, settled down and moved to the suburbs. </p> <p> <a href=\"mailto:larry.elliott@theguardian.com\">larry.elliott@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Anti-globalisation protesters hurling Molotov cocktails and cobblestones prised from Prague's historic streets fought Czech police armed with tear gas and water cannon yesterday as they sought in vain to halt the annual meeting of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. </p> <p>In a series of violent clashes, the police, backed up by army detachments, squared up to activists who were laying siege to Prague's heavily guarded congress centre yesterday. </p> <p>Five hours of angry confrontations resulted in injuries to at least 60 people and left delegates trapped inside the building by the security cordon set up to prevent a repeat of the chaos that marked the World Trade Organisation talks in Seattle last December. </p> <p>However, they failed to prevent the gathering of the world's financial elite. </p> <p>The chancellor, Gordon Brown, managed to leave the centre, but David Clementi, the deputy-governor of the Bank of England, was held up in Prague by the vast security operation mounted by the Czech authorities. </p> <p>Speaking as teargas canisters exploded in the background, Mr Brown rejected protesters' call for the Bank and the IMF to be abolished. </p> <p>\"We can neither return to the protectionism of the 1930s nor some free market dogma,\" he said. \"We need to strengthen and modernise our global institutions.\" </p> <p>Yesterday's demonstrations, which attracted only a quarter of the expected 20,000 protesters, got off to a slow start. </p> <p>Security forces ringed the conference centre and the only road across the valley leading from there to the middle of Prague was blocked by more than 30 vanloads of police and personnel carriers containing soldiers. Helicopters hovered overhead and balaclava-clad marksmen patrolled the roof of the centre. </p> <p>In the opening clashes, several police officers were set alight when a Molotov cocktail exploded among them. They were saved from serious injury when colleagues doused the flames with a water cannon. </p> <p>At one stage, a small group of protesters broke through police barricades set up in a ravine on one side of the congress centre and tried to storm the hotel where many of the financiers and central bankers attending the conference were holed up. The breakaway group made it to within 100 yards of the centre before being repulsed by water cannons and volleys of tear gas. </p> <p>One British witness, trapped inside the five-star Corinthia Towers hotel, said: \"There is a hail of missiles being thrown at the building.\" </p> <p>Financiers and journalists were pelted with stones until police pushed the protesters back using dogs and batons. </p> <p>There were reports that 69 people had been injured, two thirds of them police officers. One Japanese and one Russian delegate were also injured. Most of the injuries were from projectiles. </p> <p>As dusk fell, special trains were laid on to whisk the ministers and their delegations away from the scene. Police called reserves in from all over the country to add to the 11,000 officers already on guard, and the umbrella protest group Inpeg, which organised the marches yesterday morning, criticised the violence. </p> <p>\"We're really disappointed,\" Chelsea Mosen, an Inpeg organiser, said last night. \"We were really hoping for a non-violent protest on the basic issues of the IMF and the World Bank but instead now the focus has shifted to the streets of Prague.\" </p> <p>Earlier in the day, the president of the World Bank, James Wolfensohn told delegates to the conference that the protesters' message should be heard. </p> <p>\"I believe deeply that many of them are asking legitimate questions and I embrace the commitment of a new generation to fight poverty. I share their passion and questioning,\" he said. </p> <p>The confrontations are expected to continue today. Protest organisers have said that they \"aim to disrupt the meetings further\".</p>",

  "<p>In the middle of the last century, Nye Bevan was the people's champion. Into the lists he rode, out of the valleys of death, lancing the opposition with his scorn, his wit, his marvellous eloquence. The only one of ours able to take on Churchill who had won the war but brought out the troops against the Welsh miners. Bevan had been a miner and his revenge could get the better of him. \"Lower than vermin,\" he called the Tories and their press lynched him. Boys adopt heroes easily but it is very rare for a politician to qualify. Nye Bevan did. </p> <p>We relished his melodious oratory, we swallowed whole tall tales of his innate aristocracy (unaware of irony) - he would starve himself for days on end, we told each other, to save up for one really fine meal. He could recite volumes of poetry by heart, understand science and when he spoke in the House of Commons the assembly looked on with awe as at the young Jesus. </p> <p>But above all he was one of us. He had risen from the pits to the dispatch box and many of us wished that he had gained the leadership. I still think of it as a crucially missed opportunity not only for the Labour party but for the country. He would have brought so much that was new and fresh to leadership. The middle-class socialists who had taken over the parliamentary party (which Bevan rightly saw as the real engine of power) had brought much to the table. Bevan, however, provided what will certainly be the last real chance for a true working-class hero to become a national leader. </p> <p>The personal qualities he would have brought to it came from a sensibility in the majority but never in the ascendance in this country - what, not too inaccurately, could be called educated working class: but the education bedded in the working. </p> <p>Nye Bevan knew about the hard unpleasant labour which was the lot of most men and many women at the time he had done it. He knew the value of learning - he had struggled for it in the few leisure hours above ground. He knew about the richness and potential buried in the massed neglect of working-class life. He had seen it all around him. And he knew about the collective will, the strength of communality, the essential importance of democracy and the absolute necessity for change. </p> <p>Strong leaders make governments and influence the tone and sometimes the character of the country, I believe, and the personality of Bevan would have inspired that major part of our society which still appears to lack the confidence and high ambition found in comparable countries. He would, I think, in his policies and by his example have elevated the condition and the motivation of those thought well below the salt. He would have brought the best of working-class qualities and culture to this country at a time particularly ripe for it. </p> <p>Just as Churchill represented and helped to release one sort of Britishness in 1940 and Thatcher another in the 80s, so Bevan could have given political expression to that movement of enfranchisement of the many, which characterised the culture of the late 50s and 60s. We have never had a man of the people to lead the people. His death prevented what could have been a very un-British triumph. </p> <p>His critics will cite against him his belief in the state occupying the commanding the heights of the economy as proof that he would have led the country into the hopeless prison of socialism. But at that time politicians across the parties went along with nationalisation. Even now it could be argued that had some of those heights of the British economy been given the intelligence and the investment afforded them by their counterparts elsewhere - France for instance - then they would be rather more commanding than what has replaced them. </p> <p>The chief point I would make though is that Bevan was perpetually aware that things must change. Had he seen poverty threatening because wealth producing was being denied he would certainly have reshaped his policies as so many others did. </p> <p>It is the National Health Service which is his monument, and an intriguing one. It is regularly portrayed now as run down, terminally gone to seed, probably irrelevant to modern demands. In short, Bevan's monument is falling down. Some of its faults have been there since the 40s. The power and masonic arrogance of some of the senior medical men is continuing proof of that deep strain of resistance to the whole enterprise which grew up in the 40s and has never gone away. There were those who said, and were reported and applauded for saying it, that we had fought the Nazis to stop the sort of thing Bevan was doing with the nation's health. </p> <p>There is also the matter of those 18 years of Conservative neglect which just cannot be reversed in two or three years. </p> <p>But there are other ways in which Bevan's NHS seems to be at bay. People are living longer, and need more care. Science provides cures which can be hugely expensive and, so it goes, the system of half a century ago built for less healthy days is rapidly becoming insupportable. There is more. The rise of the insecure job-changing individual crossed with an increasingly global economy is at odds with the ethos and delivery of a system built in less demanding, better drilled times. In fact, so this argument goes, socialism will inevitably go the way of Soviet communism, and this marxist NHS, \"to each according to his needs\", is increasingly marooned in a world view and context far away from the insatiable society of today. </p> <p>But the oddest thing of all is that despite all this, all the evidence, all the portents, all the complaints, we as a country want Nye Bevan's NHS. We believe in it and cry out most loudly to make it as good as Bevan wanted it to be. In building the NHS, he did what the greatest politicians do: he met the deepest needs of the people he served. </p> <p>Another conclusion I draw from this is that Bevan found a brilliant way to smuggle his own version of Welsh Labour party socialism through the capitalist triumphalism of the 20th century. The British do indeed want their health service to take care of them \"from the cradle to the grave\" and they have a faith in the system's potential to do so which defies the often crumbling reality. </p> <p>Bevan's health service is still called upon to be democratically available to all and equally. To pay no regard to status, income or class but only to need. To engage the whole of society in a true collective. It is high idealism in action. </p> <p>It may be that as well as the NHS surviving and, who knows, eventually thriving, another factor will be at work. Bevan's credo showing its social effectiveness. Something perhaps to be bred from when called on and the present rush blows its fuse. In every ward and surgery and clinic the man's socialism marches on. That could be an even more powerful legacy. </p> <p>This is an edited extract from a speech given by Lord Bragg to the Nye Bevan Society at the Labour party conference last night.</p>",
  "Despite 65 years of ridicule, 44,000 drivers of three-wheeled cars and vans yesterday joined the actor David Jason in lamenting the decision to phase out their cherished Reliants - the last British three-wheelers on the road. <p>The eccentric vehicles won popularity, despite their shaky looking singular front wheel, because, weighing in at 450kg, a motorcycle licence is all that is required to drive one. </p> <p>With their rust-proof fibreglass body and low fuel consumption they also built a reputation as budget vehicles that would last. </p> <p>\"There goes a bit of British comic history,\" said Mr Jason, who brought the Reliant Regal three-wheeled van to global fame - in \"New York, Paris and Peckham\" - as Del Boy Trotter's \"company car\" in the 1980s BBC television series Only Fools and Horses. </p> <p>The shabby yellow three-wheeler, painted with the logo \"Trotters Independent Traders\", took Del Boy, his brother, Rodney, and their grandad around the markets of south London. </p> <p>Recently the three-wheelers have fared poorly against French-built four-wheeled microcars, which can also be driven without a full licence. </p> <p>Noel Palmer, spokesman for Reliant Cars, said that after 65 years of almost continuous production, many three-wheeler owners were turning to the French- made, high economy Ligier Ambra, costing about half the price of the hand manufactured Robin which retails at almost \u00a310,000. </p> <p>\"There will be a lot of disgruntled owners but we need to expand the Reliant cars in other areas,\" he said. </p> <p>\"We have been importing the Ligiers and have sold almost 700 through our Reliant dealership network in the last 12 months. The Ligier Ambra is a more modern car, it has four wheels and you can still drive it on a bike licence.\" </p> <p>Jim O'Meara, who owns Reliant Services garage in Stirchley, Birmingham, said the news was not unexpected. \"[Reliant] have shot themselves in the foot.\" </p> <p>\"They decided to bring in a four-wheel vehicle you can drive with a motorcycle licence. Two French firms have done the same and undercut them. </p> <p>\"It's not surprising. If they would cut the price in half, they would have been able to keep going.\" </p> <p>Mr Palmer said he sympathised with the anger of some Robin dealers and owners but the marque \"which has almost become a British institution\" could not be sustained. </p> <p>\"Robins are bought by traditional and loyal buyers,\" he said. \"A lot of them are on their 10th or 12th car; but they are an elderly and a very niche market.\" </p> <p>Mr Palmer said the end of the Robin would not mean job losses at the Burntwood production line in Staffordshire. He said: \"Because of our increase in the import business, all the existing staff have been redeployed. </p> <p>\"We will reorganise the factory for a new model, not a three-wheeler, to be announced at the Birmingham motor show in October.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile, Mr Palmer tried to placate three-wheel enthusiasts by announcing a special edition Robin 65s to roll off the production line until the end of the year. </p> <p>It will have chrome door handles, a walnut dashboard, a stainless steel exhaust, and, of course, three alloy wheels.</p> <p><b>On the road to fame</b></p> <p>\u0095 The Robin appeared in the 1977 film Star Wars. Luke Skywalker's hovering landspeeder was built around one. </p> <p>\u0095 In 1989 a Cheshire firm was reported to be giving Robins to sales staff who failed to meet their targets. </p> <p>\u0095 In 1992 traffic police in Kent were overtaken by a customised Robin, fitted with a 1000cc Nissan engine, at 102mph. </p> <p>\u0095 In 1997 repair and delivery staff at the the US embassy in London introduced a fleet of Robins to get around quickly. </p> <p>\u0095 A 20 stone Yorkshire trucker said this year he had two sacks of potatoes in the passenger seat to stop his tipping over.</p>",
  "<p>Welcome to a special 80s has-been Court Circular this week, featuring two of the most desperate cases you could ever find in legalistic strife. Kicking off the action is 80s has-been TV actor <strong> Jan-Michael Vincent</strong>, the former Airwolf star whose life since the demise of said show has routinely made supermarket tabloid headlines. And now he's finally wound up inside, after being sentenced to 60 days in an Orange County, California lock-up for repeated probation violations, culminating in an argument with his wife which led to \"pushing and hair-pulling\". Regular readers of this column may already be aware of the hapless Vincent's troubled history, dating back - at least - to 1996, with an arrest for drunk-driving following a car crash that left him partially paralysed; since then, the erstwhile pin-up has been arrested three times this year alone, on one occasion being discovered by police rolling around in the grass in Santa Monica with over three times the legal blood-alcohol limit coursing through his veins. Currently in rehab, Vincent's jail sentence begins later this week, after which he's to return to the clinic on an indefinite basis. </p> <p>And then there's 80s has-been rock star <strong> Rick Springfield</strong>, whose career after the global smash hit that was Jesse's Girl has followed a similar trajectory to our friend Jan-Michael, right down to his arrest in Malibu last week for spousal assault. Springfield's run-in with the law came after a heated domestic argument was overheard by his sister-in-law, who then called 911; although the ruckus later subsided, police nonetheless turned up at the singer's house and - upon noticing \"minor injuries\" to his wife's face - took him down for an evening in LA County Jail. After posting $50,000 bail, he was released pending the District Attorney's decision over whether to press charges...</p>",
  "<p>Never mind This Life, <strong> Attachments</strong> (BBC2) is oddly reminiscient of Big Brother. Of the team of bright-ish, young-ish things thrown into a precarious situation, one is a lesbian, one is a skateboarder (admittedly not the same one), one is a lech and one is even duplicitous - stealing another's CV to get a job. They sit around in east London smoking and swearing, they have a webcam in their toilet, and there is plenty of naturalistic camera work. There is even a not-very-good website. There is also some slightly dodgy acting going on. And the latter notwithstanding, the characters who populate the drama will perhaps become like dear friends in the weeks to come. The first episode, however, wasn't a good start. </p> <p>Following the start-up of <a href=\"http:www.seethru.co.uk\" target\"_new\">seethru.co.uk</a> - which actually exists - it began, rather predictably, with some nudity. First, there's Brandon. He is a Louis Theroux-a-like who skateboards around the office with his bits out. From this, we can assume he is a geeky technical type who is slightly dysfunctional. Then there are Mike and Lucy, the brains behind the website. They lie on top of their duvet in their ersatz Elle Decoration room and are about to make sweet, sweet love when a phone call from the naked Brandon stops them. From this, we can assume they are passionate but businesslike. As the rest of the cast is introduced, we are laboriously spoonfed with little nuggets of their personalities, which could have been happily avoided if they had all worn t-shirts with their main characteristics on them (\"lesbian, anti-establishment, crisp-eater\", for Sophie, say). Instead, we got a procession as predictable as the nudity of the opening scenes. It's been called \"attention-grabbing\", but only if you have a very short attention span and don't get out much. </p> <p>Of course, the nudity is supposed to be \"true to life\" and no big deal. And of course, it is both. To use it in the opening sequence is hardly cutting edge. The deployment of naked people (who, in a radical move, were all thin and toned and easy on the eye) is a patronising clich\u00e9, as if the producers couldn't think of anything else to grab viewers attention. \"I know,\" they must have exclaimed. \"Let's get a bit of cock on screen within the first five minutes. That'll catch the audience's eye.\" Unfortunately, it doesn't really capture the imagination. After all, the target audience for Attachments probably see naked people quite a lot, if only themselves and their partners (in their ersatz Elle Deco bedrooms). </p> <p>Which isn't to say it all goes downhill after the naked skateboarding. In fact, Attachments shows potential, though it's hard to tell how good it will get. Lucy and Mike's relationship could be ripe for exploration, though only if they stop being quite so nice to each other. Equally, the arrival of the new sales manager, Yvonne, makes watching at least next week compulsory. The CV stealer, her presence is bound to up the ante in the oh-so-trendy office where Reece, the lech, Jake, the gay designer, Sophie and Brandon amble around. As for their relationship, there simply wasn't enough of it on display to make any judgements. For 50 minutes of drama, there wasn't an awful lot happening anywhere. Lucy might have been struggling with whether to join seethru.co.uk as planned or accept a promotion at her old job, Reece might have been anonymously sending Sophie nasty emails and Jake might have lost the entire site's contents, but even with all of that, Attachments still seemed a bit empty and undramatic. Even Joe, the scheming investor, having an embolism in the toilet didn't help matters, nor did the once new protean and naturalistic camerawork, which verged on self-parody. </p> <p>The This Life comparisons abound; Attachments probably won't match up to the (slightly inflated) opinion of that as a genuinely exciting, groundbreaking series, but hopefully it will develop into a compelling spectacle instead of a rather conspicuous drama-by-numbers set in a groovy environment to appeal to da kids. As it is, it is not as mature or well-written as The Cops - and comparisons with that are inevitable too - nor as populated with genuinely multi-faceted, fleshy characters nor as muscular plots. It is so forced a contemporary drama, it could almost be on Channel 4. While leagues ahead of much of television's dramatic offerings, it is disappointingly underwhelming. Personally, I am hoping for an upgrade.</p>",
  "<p>Four years after floating, London &amp; Edinburgh Publishing is to change its name. Publishing, after all, is a rather old fashioned word conjuring up images of dusty old men in a dusty old business. </p> <p>Also, London and Edinburgh may be modern cities but they are more suggestive of the British Isles than the global interests of the new-media age. </p> <p>London &amp; Edinburgh's recent acquisition of Profile Pursuit Group has prompted the naming plans. It will become Profile Media Group, \"to reflect more accurately the group's activities and its development into a broader-based media and communications group\". The group said it would explore opportunities to enhance existing activities and investigate potential acquisitions. </p> <p>Profile Pursuit Group was set up to exploit a niche market: bespoke publications for companies with large, dispersed networks of customers or staff. Revenue was raised from advertising the publications attracted. </p> <p>The April acquisition gave London &amp; Edinburgh a big US presence which, combined with strong organic growth, underlay its record first-half results, the firm said. It posted a pre-tax profit of \u00a31.85m to the end of June, compared to \u00a3795,827 a year ago. It also reported a trading profit before tax and goodwill amortisation of \u00a32.22m, up from \u00a3490,000. Turnover rose to \u00a39.23m from \u00a32.33m. </p> <p>London &amp; Edinburgh has grown since its flotation in 1996. Last year it bought the Good Ski Guide's title and assets and reaped instant rewards from buying PPG. </p> <p>Deputy chairman David Ellingham said: \"We are very much a niche publisher, but we have \u00a35m in the bank and we are a cash-generative business, so we want to make sizeable acquisitions.\" </p> <p>He declined to say whether they would be in the US, but the new nomenclature points to international growth. </p> <p>The shares closed 1.75p down to 50.75p. Wait and see before investing. </p>",
  "<p>They came with balloons and globes, samba and trumpets, a rainbow collective of political causes from at least 30 countries across Europe. Socialists were to march with ecologists, old communists with new democrats, anarchists with unionists, and anti-corporates with extremists and dreamers. The common language was to be direct action. </p> <p>It was billed as the first pan-European protest against global capitalism, the biggest political party against globalisation since Seattle, and the first major riposte to the west's triumph over communism. But within an hour of up to 15,000 people rallying in Peace Square, the battle of Prague was inevitable. </p> <p>The protest coordinators had divided the groups into three - red, blue and yellow - with the intention of forming a human chain around the former communist centre of culture where the World Bank meetings were being held. The 11,000 Czech police, primed by the FBI and European police forces, had no intention of letting them anywhere near the hall. </p> <p>By 11.30am the marchers had set off in three directions. The Italian Ya Bastas , widely regarded by the protesters as the most disciplined, stylish and effective of all Europe s direct-action groups, were the obvious choice for a direct assault over \"suicide bridge\", a four-lane highway leading almost directly to the centre. </p> <p>Leading the yellow march of 700 protesters in lines of 30, the Ya Bastas - meaning \"enough\" - linked arms, carried tyres and plastic shields and protected themselves with gas masks. Behind them came several thousand unionists and international socialists, as well as groups from Turkey, Greece, Spain and France. </p> <p>Around 460 metres from the bridge, 800 metres from the conference centre, they halted. As expected, the bridge was blocked by armoured personnel carriers, several hundred riot police and water cannon. The police had their own banners, exhorting the protesters in three languages to disperse. </p> <p>Fat chance. A Ya Basta representative came forward and held an impromptu press conference. \"This is a historic moment,\" he declared. \"The IMF/World Bank needs tanks and guns to defend itself from the poorest in the world. We are going to take civil action on behalf of the millions and millions of starving, the billions of poor who earn less than $2 [\u00a31.40] a day, whom the IMF and World Bank are ignoring or consigning to slavery.\" </p> <p>The Ya Basta activists strutted forward through a line of international media. They moved crash barriers and charged the police, breaking every 10 minutes for drinks. Back they came, the police batting them off with their shields. Ya Basta retreated, took a run at the police and then used the crowd barriers as battering rams. Scuffles broke out. Ya Basta then tried to use balloons, launching more than 500 at the police and running underneath them. The police lines held, with tear gas and batons used sporadically. In two hours the police had retreated 1.5 metres and many thousands of protesters were backed up for 12 blocks or so. </p> <p>Meanwhile the red march, led by carnivalistas and samba groups, was circling round the conference centre and trying to approach it from the south-west. The march of at least 3,000 people included British veterans of Twyford Down and the June 18 city riots, but was peppered by hardcore activists from many countries. </p> <p>They had taken the police and several bankers by surprise. Two Japanese financiers caught up in the march had to be whisked into a hotel by bodyguards. </p> <p>Activists sang and tried to defuse the so-far minor confrontations with humour and \"tactical frivolity\". The y met no resistance for more than an hour, and got to within 200 metres of the centre before the police intervened with tear gas, water cannon and percussion grenades. Scuffles broke out as protesters continued to move forward, throwing samba rattles at police. </p> <p>The hard core then moved in and police hit them with batons, the protesters responding by hurling back banners and bottles . The police continued to push back activists, splitting the group in two. </p> <p>Meanwhile the third march of another 2,000-3,000 people, led by the international socialists, the British group Reclaim the Streets, feminist anarchists and old socialist revolutionaries had circled west and south. They tried repeatedly to get up the cobbled streets to the centre but were met by lines of riot police and troops. However, one group got to within 50 metres of the centre, with a few people dodging through the official lines. </p> <p>Jakob, a German student dressed in a suit and and Kate Evans from Yorkshire, wearing a silver cocktail dress with pink tail feathers, climbed over roofs and reached the centre, spending, they said, 45 minutes milling with delegates. </p> <p><strong> Grenades</strong><br> </p> <p> \"I had a great chat with a man from the Royal Canadian Mint and told him what we were doing. He said he respected people's rights to protest as long as they did not go 'too far'. I cannot believe that nobody challenged me. All I did was ladder my tights,\" Ms Evans said. </p> <p>Down the hill the battles were becoming fiercer, with police letting off thousands of volleys of percussion grenades, tear gas drifting through the streets and protesters hurling stones. Almost every shop and front door had been barricaded, with messages from residents pleading with protesters not to smash windows. </p> <p>Jan Urban, a Czech dissident who was one of the leading figures during the revolt against the communists in 1989, was begging the protesters to calm down. \"It s going to get far worse than this,\" a protester replied. </p> <p>With the city streets empty of residents, many watched the goings-on from the safety of their flats. Others took their own direct action - one old man handing out stones to protesters, and a woman hurling buckets of water on to riot police. </p> <p>The scale of the riots and the fact that the police had resorted to tactics not seen since the communist era shook the Czechs. \"We were warned, but I never thought this would happen - what can we say?\" said one driver. </p> <p>Later in the afternoon, with barricades burning and the police continuing to push people away from the conference centre, there were reports of petrol bombs being thrown by protesters, and of police throwing back large rocks. A Polish man was reportedly in a coma last night. </p> <p>What started as a carnival had turned into one of Europe's worst riots in years.</p>",
  "More people visited a historic attraction last year than a cinema, according to a Mori survey of attitudes to the historic environment. <p>Over half the population, 51%, claimed to have visited a historic building or site in the past year, and the figure rose to 58% if museums were included, compared with 50% who said they had visited a cinema, and 17% who had been to a football match. </p> <p>The English Heritage-commissioned survey, which showed near universal belief in the importance of the historic buildings and sites if only as an educational resource - 98% said it was important for helping children and 96% for letting adults learn more about the past - came as a relief to the government's conservation adviser. </p> <p>Sir Neil Cossons, English Heritage chairman, and his predecessor, Sir Jocelyn Stevens, have consistently argued that the government had underestimated the importance that visitors and people in England attached to the historic environment. </p> <p>The survey not only supported this, but showed that a massive majority was quite happy to put taxpayers' money where its mouth was: 88% believed there should be public funding to preserve the heritage, and 76% did not agree that too much was already preserved. Only 2% said they had no interest in the heritage. </p> <p>Sir Neil was delighted at the overwhelming support shown by the research. \"There is a strong feeling that heritage should be preserved to be passed on to future generations,\" he said. \"This has serious implications for the way England's history and geogra phy are taught in the national curriculum and for the access and information provided by ourselves and other heritage bodies.\" </p> <p>However, there was also a warning note, in the first national attempt to gauge the attitude of of black and Asian communities, through focus group interviews. These showed many felt excluded from England's historic environment, or even unwelcome. </p> <p>Overall, many were concerned about the cost of travelling and gaining admission to historic sites, and were often more interested in the buildings and streets in their own immediate surroundings. </p> <p>There was strong support for one of the most controversial innovations of the last 10 years, the listing of post-war buildings which were often regarded as eyesores when built. Buildings recently given the grade II* listing include Park Hill housing estate in Sheffield and the Trellick tower block in west London. </p> <p>The survey showed 76% interest in modern architecture and support for the listings programme, and a majority disagreed with the statement that nothing after 1950 should be regarded as \"heritage\". </p> <p>This enthusiasm for modern architecture had increased by 10% since the last English Heritage/Mori survey in 1997. </p> <p>\"It is very encouraging that there is such overwhelming interest in our historic environment,\" Martin Cherry, English Heritage's head of listed buildings, said yesterday. </p> <p>\"The historic environment has never quite been seen, by the public or the government, as a vital part of the environment in the same way as the birds or the bees or the countryside. This survey should help to push it much further up the agenda.\"</p>",
  "<p>ICI shares are again under pressure and this time the reason is not the oil price. The strategy of focusing on speciality chemicals is being questioned by analysts who are becoming increasingly sceptical of claims that margins in this area are relatively immune from pricing pressures. </p> <p>Yesterday, ICI shares dropped 13.5p to 356p, their lowest level in more than 15 year, after a profits warning from IFF, the global leader in flavours and fragrances which competes directly with ICI's Quest division. </p> <p>The fact that a major player like IFF is experiencing \"weak business conditions\" in its North American flavour operations does not bode well for ICI. About 24% of Quest's sales are in the US. </p> <p>According to analysts, the response of IFF to its troubles is likely to be a crucial factor in determining the future direction of margins in this segment of the speciality chemicals universe.</p>",
  "<p>The president of the World Bank, James Wolfensohn, told protesters against globalisation that he shared their passion for fighting poverty, as he sought to show that his besieged institution was working for change. </p> <p>In his address to the annual meeting of the bank and the International Monetary Fund, he said he wanted globalisation to be an instrument of opportunity and inclusion, but stressed that there was no turning back from a more integrated world economy. </p> <p>\"Outside these walls, young people are demonstrating against globalisation,\" he told an audience of central bankers, finance ministers and financiers. \"I believe deeply that many of them are asking legitimate questions, and I embrace the commitment of a new generation to fight poverty. I share their passion and their questioning.\" </p> <p>Mr Wolfensohn admitted that for too many people in developing countries, living standards were not rising. </p> <p>\"We live in a world scarred by inequality,\" he said. \"Something is wrong when the richest 20% of the global population receive more than 80% of the global income.\" </p> <p>In an attempt to show that the bank was on the side of the poor, he urged deeper and faster debt relief, the dismantling of trade barriers to goods from poor countries and special grants for Aids, the environment, education and health. He also called for streamlined procedures to allow rich countries and global institutions to work together more efficiently. </p> <p>The managing director of the IMF, Horst Kohler, said he was aware of the debate about the impact of globalisation. But he stressed that if the IMF did not exist, somebody would have to invent it. </p> <p>\"More than ever\", Mr Kohler insisted, \"globalisation requires cooperation and it requires institutions which organise this cooperation.\"</p>",
  "With pitbulls, dobermans and rottweilers under fire from the French authorities, youth gangs in the depressed city suburbs have discovered an alternative way to intimidate their rivals - with attack monkeys. <p>\"They're ultra-fashionable,\" said Didier Lecourbe, a police officer from the depressed Paris suburb of Aubervilliers. \"There are dozens of them. Kids take them out on leads, and even carry baby monkeys around in nappies. But these animals can be very dangerous indeed.\"</p> <p>Imported illegally through Spain from Gibraltar, Morocco or Algeria, the Barbary apes are known for their powerful limbs, sharp teeth and short tempers. Veterinary experts say they can be turned into frightening and effective weapons.</p> <p>\"They live naturally on rocks or in a desert environment,\" said Marie-Claude Bomsel of the natural history museum in Paris. \"Removed from their natural habitat, they can become highly aggressive. They bite, and their favoured method of attack is to hurl themselves at people's heads.\"</p> <p>Police believe as many as 500 Barbary apes may have been smuggled into France in the past two years. Bought for about \u00a330 each by youngsters visiting their families in north Africa, they change hands on the council estates around Paris for as much as \u00a3300.</p> <p>\"Now the authorities have cracked down on pitbulls and the rest, apes look like becoming the new weapon of choice,\" said Mr Lecourbe. \"We've heard of monkey-fights being run in tower block basements.\"</p> <p>Ms Bomsel said the museum had received dozens of telephone calls from owners wanting to know how to deal with violent monkeys, or how to get rid of them. \"The zoos don't want to know because apes that have grown up outside their natural environment will not live with others,\" she said. A spokeswoman for the the society for the protection of animals said the society had taken in more than 40 apes in the past 18 months and its Paris animal homes were full.</p>",
  "<p>The government's NHS plan has promised us thousands more health professionals, not only to overcome staff shortages faced in many areas but also to expand provision through extra hospital and intermediate care beds, GP surgeries and nurse-led, walk-in centres. </p> <p>All of this is excellent news. But there is one small problem. All the extra money and all the promises on paper will make no difference unless thousands of willing people decide to work for the NHS. </p> <p>Skilled people are the single most important resource for any health service. At present, they are also the most scarce - and the prospects of keeping them are not good. Growing proportions of nurses and inner-city GPs are nearing retirement age. Many more health workers are moving into the private sector, or to job opportunities outside the health system, and are not being replaced by sufficient new recruits. </p> <p>A recent King's Fund report, The Last Straw, found that NHS nurses were unhappy about poor pay, bleak conditions and chronic shortages of basic resources that they experience on a daily basis. They were frustrated by inflexible working arrangements, limited career development opportunities and lack of control over their working environment. Racist harassment and discrimination were also strongly in evidence. The implications of these findings for the recruitment and retention of health workers are considerable. </p> <p>There is a wider issue here, too, which should be of concern to anyone who works for, or with, the public sector. The concept of public service, which in recent history has been a source of pride and commitment, has gradually fallen into disrepute. Ambitious young people, leaving schools and universities, no longer see public service as the height of personal achievement. Instead, it is associated with ponderous bureaucracy, political manipulation, poor opportunities and low pay. </p> <p>If the government wants to succeed with its NHS plan, it must make public service seem worthwhile to a wider group of people. Ministers must show they value public sector workers, not just by saying so, but by demonstrating their commitment in practice. They must provide bigger pay packets, better (and broader) career opportunities, more flexible working arrangements and much more of a chance for workers at all levels to influence how services are run. </p> <p>The concept of public service, wrapped up in the values of another century, looks dated. The challenge for ministers is to build a new vision of public service that harnesses the values of equity and altruism, as well as chiming with the personal goals of the kinds of people the state needs to get to work for it - and for all of us.</p>"
