  "<p>Financial markets always like to see the back of October. Too often it has proved a month of ill omen, springing nasty surprises on investors. The crashes of 1929 and 1987 both took place in the 10th month of the year. So what chance another Black October? </p> <p>Equity markets are nervous - and with good reason. The technology-rich Nasdaq index in the US has lost 35.2% of its value since its peak on March 3 this year as millennium euphoria evaporated to be replaced by a long, hard look at the earnings potential of some leading players. Over the past couple of months there has been a blizzard of profits warnings and earnings downgrades by analysts. Sky high price to earnings ratios are only sustainable if investors are confident growing revenues will eventually translate into profit. That confidence, which underpinned the near indiscriminate buying spree last year, is no longer in evidence. Few new economy titans have escaped. </p> <p>It's not only the US where investors can see the hi-tech bubble deflating. In Europe, the equally severe fallout has seen its share of profit warnings and postponed public offerings. If that were the end of the story - one overinflated sector getting its comeuppance, there would be nothing to worry about. </p> <p>Sadly, it is only chapter one. Equity markets have a broader problem. According to the IMF, this has been the best year for the global economy since the late 1980s. But it has not been translated into the sort of earnings growth analysts and investors expected. Companies, having over-invested, are seeing costs rise while consumers remain price conscious. That is bad for shares. </p> <p>The US's appetite for spending has always been influenced by Wall Street's performance. The linkage has been strengthened by the billions of dollars in share options attached to hi-tech stocks. So when new economy shares suffer those in the old economy suffer too, because consumption declines. </p> <p><strong> Out of kilter</strong><br> </p> <p> Bond markets are traditionally a safe haven when investors turn leery of equity markets. Last week saw some \"flight to quality\", but even here investment decisions are becoming trickier. On one hand, demand for government bonds is strong but supply is restricted by budget surpluses in the US and Britain. On the other, investors contemplating the corporate bond market are asking for higher returns to justify what they see as higher risks. </p> <p>This is particularly true in telecoms, where some of the best names are having to fund the huge cost of acquiring a portfolio of third generation mobile phone licences. Before the auctions started few guessed the extent to which balance sheets would be stretched. Now investors are asking how quickly the companies can generate a return. </p> <p>The foreign exchange market also seems way out of kilter. Fair enough, the euro is weak against the dollar because of perceptions about the relative strengths of the economies. But why then is the Japanese yen not under the thumb of thegreenback, given that Japan's growth is weaker than Europe's and it has taken only the first few steps towards the \"Anglo-Saxon\" flexibility investors demand these days. </p> <p>Should the weakness in US equity markets drag down the dollar, the impact on Europe and Japan would be damaging since it would make exporting to the US harder at a time when that market itself was slowing down. </p> <p>Finally, there is the joker in the pack: oil. It's 27 years this month since the Yom Kippur war led to a fourfold increase in the price of oil. Fears of another outbreak of hostilities is negating recent efforts to push down the cost of a barrel of crude down to around $25 a barrel. Yesterday it was above $31 and rising. An oil-price shock is the last thing the world economy markets need. </p> <p>This all sounds terribly gloomy - there is no inevitability about the global economy stumbling. Markets have shrugged off problems before, as recently as two years ago, when Alan Greenspan acted to prevent the global economy going under in the wake of Russia's debt default. </p> <p>Fears of weaker corporate earnings, incipient inflation and tight labour markets could all wash away if Greenspan steers a course between the Scylla of rising inflation and the Charybdis of a slowing economy. A soft landing is a possibility but no more than that. Much rests on the shoulders of the Fed chief: if he sneezes, the world may catch a cold.</p>",
  "<p>For 20 years global efforts to curb climate change have concentrated on finding ways to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from industry and transport. But could that approach be fundamentally wrong? </p> <p>Yes, says Dr James Hansen, one of America's leading climate scientists and the man credited with persuading Vice-President Al Gore of the seriousness of global warming. </p> <p>In a controversial new report, Hansen and colleagues at Nasa's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York, urge the world's governments radically to re-think climate change strategy. They claim that the emphasis on carbon dioxide (CO2) may have been misplaced, with atmospheric levels of the gas apparently stabilising in the late 1990s. And they argue that global efforts should be redirected to using existing technologies to cut other climate-warming pollutants such as methane and traffic-generated ozone and black carbon (soot). </p> <p>The report, published in the Proceedings of the US National Academy of Sciences, says that reducing the release of methane from landfills and rice paddies and of black soot from diesel-powered vehicles will combat warming more quickly than concentrating on CO2. To this end, it urges western nations to help the developing world to adopt proven clean technologies such as catalytic converters and waste-to-energy plants which capture methane. </p> <p>In the early 1980s, Hansen was one of the first scientists to link rising temperatures with rising levels of carbon dioxide - and to warn of dire consequences if mankind failed to cut consumption of the coal, oil and gas which fuel modern economies. But he now claims that climate change should be significantly cheaper and easier to combat than previously thought. </p> <p>\"We're suggesting a more optimistic scenario than the conventional wisdom which says that curtailing global warming is almost hopeless,\" Hansen told the Guardian. \"I believe the prospects for having a modest rather than a disastrous climate impact are quite good.\" </p> <p>Hansen and his colleagues accept the scientific consensus that carbon dioxide is responsible for roughly half of all man-made global warming over the last half century. But their report cites evidence that man-made CO2 emissions have slowed considerably in the last 20 years and even fell slightly in 1998 and 1999, while the global economy - and fossil fuel consumption - has boomed. It also says that fossil fuel industries should no longer be the primary targets for remedial action, as the chemical aerosols released by the same plants form a cooling blanket in the atmosphere, offsetting the warming effects of their carbon emissions. </p> <p>Hansen added that there would be \"huge\" public health benefits from making a more concerted, worldwide effort to tackle air pollution which blights crops and exacerbates respiratory diseases in millions of people worldwide. \"I am not suggesting that we forget about carbon dioxide, I am suggesting that we place a strong emphasis on tropospheric ozone and black carbon - substances which not only have a warming effect but also a huge impact on human health. These substances are not even included in the current Kyoto negotiations.\" </p> <p>His report, however, has dismayed environmentalists and many climate scientists. They fear that by confusing the science of climate change it may undermine political will to implement the 1997 Kyoto treaty. Already, the powerful US fossil fuel lobby has used Hansen's findings to question the credibility of the treaty, which binds nations to cut emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases to below 1990 levels by 2008-2012. </p> <p>Dr George Woodwell, a climate expert and director of the Woods Hole Research Centre in Massachusetts, denounced Hansen's proposals as \"dangerous\" and \"crazy\". The recent drop in carbon dioxide levels, he said, was probably caused by an as yet unidentified \"sink\", such as vegetation, which was soaking up the gas but could be saturated at any time, causing atmospheric levels to soar again. </p> <p>\"Arguing that we should forget about CO2 for the time being while we reduce other greenhouse gases assumes that we have time to allow carbon dioxide levels to just keep on rising,\" he said. \"That would be a very dangerous assumption on which to base the future of six billion people.\" </p> <p>Roger Higman, climate campaigner at Friends of the Earth in London, claimed Hansen's proposals were aimed at making action to slow climate change more palatable to America's car-loving policymakers and public. \"It's a tactical suggestion to try to rescue the Kyoto treaty and get it ratified by the US Congress. But concentrating first on other greenhouse gases will only delay the judgment day when America will have to get to grips with its petroleum economy.\"</p>",
  "<p>It all sounds terribly neat. Two trees equals four pots of tea a day for six years; five trees planted soak up enough carbon to allow conscience-free driving in an average car for a year; 40 trees equal the average home's carbon dioxide emissions over five years; or seven trees buys carbon credits for five London to New York single air tickets. </p> <p>In theory, if you plant enough trees you can offset any polluting personal habits you may have; or, if you are an industry or a country, you can think big and cover whole regions in forests and become \"carbon neutral\". And all you need is money. No effort is required because all over the place there are companies springing up whose mission is to calculate how many trees you need, arrange places to plant them and guarantee that your efforts are properly certified and credited. </p> <p>But while some governments, notably that of the US, are wildly enthusiastic about storing carbon in new forests, and see it as a way of offsetting a large part of its emissions, Europe is dubious. Some environment groups regard it as downright dishonest , a get-out clause which allows an easy escape from taking domestic action to combat climate change. </p> <p>This will make the issue of carbon sinks, as they are known, the biggest single sticking point at climate talks in the Hague in November. This crunch meeting comes after three years of tedious negotiations on the Kyoto protocol designed as the legally binding first step in dealing with the threat of global warming. The aim of the protocol is to reduce the industrial world's greenhouse gas emissions by 5% on 1990 levels as a first step to the 60% scientists say is needed. Kyoto was always seen as the beginning of greater things but if there is no deal in the Hague there is no other way forward for the treaty and we would all be sunk - literally, if the scientists are right and sea levels rise continuously for the next 300 years. </p> <p>A sink is a natural way of capturing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and turning it back into the solid carbon. Trees are the obvious example but the most potent sink is plankton which while living take carbon dioxide from the atmopshere to create their body mass and when they die \"sink\" to the bottom of the sea, taking the carbon with them. </p> <p>The reason the issue of sinks has become so important is that the US, the world's largest emitter of carbon dioxide, cannot reach its greenhouse gas reduction target under current domestic political measures. The economy has boomed so much since the baseline date of 1990 that carbon dioxide emissions would have to be cut back by as much as 30% on business as usual to reach the 2010 target of 7% reduction. </p> <p>President Clinton's advisers say they knew this in 1997 when the original deal was struck, which is why they insisted that credits for sinks, carbon trading and other deals outside the domestic arena were built in to the agreement. This issue has become the more urgent because in the last three years the US economy has boomed even more. As a result the scope for action at home to curb greenhouse gases is made more difficult, a fact not helped by the recent rise in petrol prices. </p> <p>So, for the US, sinks have become an ever larger part of the answer. Everyone wants more forests, they say - surely it's a winner. Superficially, the US is right: it is hard to object to the idea of sinks. Covering derelict land with trees, replacing long-cleared woods and forests, holds a great attraction. It also gives new value and possible protection to depleted forests, which might otherwise be cleared for agriculture. Credits should be allowed, says the US, for allowing secondary forests to regrow and fix carbon. </p> <p>The Americans and their allies, Japan, Australia and Canada, also argue for all sorts of credits for other land use - for example, direct injection of seeds into farmland rather than ploughing also prevents carbon escaping from the soil. </p> <p>The problem is that neat calculations about trees and cups of tea have so many uncertainties attached. On a large scale when the trees and undergrowth are growing in a new forest guestimates of carbon fixing could be millions of tonnes awry. As Michael Meacher, Britain's environment minister, and Jurgen Tritten, his German opposite number, put it in a joint statement on September 3, a wrong calculation on how much carbon is saved could bring a 20% increase in emissions, rather than the 5% decrease agreed as a first step under the protocol. The US accepts the science is uncertain although research is improving. To get round the problem the pro-sink countries are suggesting claiming only a percentage of the carbon saved - say 50% of the best guess. </p> <p>But even assuming calculations about carbon uptake of a new forest over the next 10 years could be agreed, what happens in 30 or 50 years when new woods begin to reach maturity? At least some of the wood should be harvested, potentially putting carbon back into the atmosphere. Worse, as this summer in the US has made plain, some forests burn down unpredictably due to lightning strikes. The third possibility is that as the climate changes the forests die anyway - as the scientists predict will happen to the Amazon by 2050. In any of these scenarios, what happens to the accrued carbon credits? Do they have to be repaid? </p> <p>A serious secondary problem for environmentalists is also the type of tree and forest planted. The best trees from the carbon point of view, fast-growing varieties which create bulk, such as eucalyptus or genetically modified poplar, are not going to create the sort of natural forests that are best for biodiversity. If big business demands maximum carbon for its bucks, wildlife will not necessarily benefit. There has even been proposals to clear natural forests and replace them with dense plantations of fast-growing trees to claim extra credits. </p> <p>To illustrate how far apart the various sides are at so late a stage in the negotiations, the US is demanding that there should be no cap on the credits it can gain for sinks - it could in theory create enough forests to achieve all its carbon dioxide reductions without taking a single action at home. The EU position is that all countries must achieve at least 50% of their targets through domestic action, a tall order for boom countries such as the US and Ireland. A majority of the green lobby is tempted to demand that while the science remains so uncertain sinks should be excluded from the deal altogether. </p> <p>A telling point was made by the British delegation in the last round of \"pre-talks\" in Lyon last month. Leaving carbon in the ground in the form of coal or oil is the best way of perma nently keeping it out of the atmosphere - sinks at best only store it temporarily. Since the Lyon meeting, where it seemed the issue was incapable of resolution, American delegations have been touring Europe to try to soften up individual EU countries on sinks. The US bottom line was: a free hand on sinks or there will be no deal in the Hague. </p> <p>It seems the Kyoto process is already in deep water. </p> <p> Additional research: Larry Lohmann</p>",
  "<p>Tony Blair is interested in architecture again - this time, in the quality and appearance of public buildings. The cynics say it will pass. But others sense that the prime minister has the bit between his teeth and believe that action will follow. </p> <p>Blair last week launched a report, Better Public Buildings, before an audience of architectural stars such as Lords Foster and Rogers. In a foreword to the study, the prime minister attacks the products of much modern architecture as \"ugly, ill-suited to the needs of their users and costly to maintain\". And he promises to improve radically the standard of public buildings, leaving a \"legacy of high quality buildings that can match the best of what we inherited from the Victorians\". </p> <p>The report itself, by the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (Cabe), a very New Labour organisation replacing the fusty old Royal Fine Art Commission, calls on government departments to \"stop being frightened to take risks\", to \"stop regarding design as an optional extra\" and to start \"allowing enough design time for projects of real quality to emerge\". Few could disagree with that. </p> <p>Blair's comments refer to a golden age when buildings \"embodied a strong sense of civic pride\". This could be seen as the architectural equivalent of John Major's nostalgia for a nation of warm beer drinkers. In truth, there was no golden age; public buildings are as mixed a bag now as they have always been. </p> <p>But the report's heart is, at least, in the right place. And with a flood of new buildings funded by the national lottery, and architects such as Rogers bending the ear of the establishment, it may seem as if we are experiencing some kind of architectural nirvana. </p> <p>Yet the lottery has delivered only a few, if excellent, landmark public buildings, such as the splendid library in Peckham, south London, by Alsop &amp; St\u00f6rmer, hotly tipped to win this year's Stirling prize. There may be few stinkers, it is true, but there is an awful lot of dreariness. And the report is right to suggest that \"good design should not be confined to high profile buildings\", citing fine local architecture such as the GP surgery in City Road, Manchester, by Hodder Associates. </p> <p>This is not the first time the government has pledged support for British design. You may remember \"creative Britain\", born around the time of \"Cool Britannia\", when lots of creative types were invited to number 10. That soon fizzled away. You may remember, too, the urban taskforce report, with its promises of turning British cities into models of continental cool. Now even the placid Rogers has reportedly been drumming his fingers impatiently, waiting for the government finally to publish its urban white paper response. </p> <p>Yet the industry appears positive about the new report. Jon Rouse, Cabe's youthful new chief executive, is optimistic that it will not just sit in Blair's in-tray. \"No, I think the PM has thrown his weight behind it,\" he says. Isabel Allen, editor of the Architects' Journal agrees: \"It's easy to be cynical about it, but in this case there seems to be real steps to achieve the aims.\" </p> <p>Perhaps the government will give a lead by putting its own house in order. It promises to improve the design of buildings created through the private finance initiative. It also promises, encouragingly, to make sure high level ministers, such as housing minister Nick Raynsford and arts minister Alan Howarth, will champion design in their own departments. \"This is crucial,\" says Allen. \"All the best public buildings have one person, such as a committed client, to drive them through.\" </p> <p>Recent government-linked controversies, such as the Millennium Dome and Portcullis House, the costly new Westminster office block for MPs, have shown there has to be a publicly accountable figure to take responsibility. This will become all the more important when Gordon Brown's public spending boost becomes concrete over the next few years in the form of new schools and health centres. Cabe, too, has promised to spend its recent \u00a32m grant from the government on giving advice to public clients, from hospitals to schools, on creating better buildings. But, realistically, that is all the government can do. There is no extra money to bring about Blair's civic renaissance. </p> <p>The real trouble with this approach, however, is not so much that it will result in inaction and money wasted on endless reports, but that it neglects entirely to support the cultural aspects of architecture. Its definition of \"good architecture\" appears to be buildings which balance the books. Blair rightly avoids pronouncing on style - he does not, after all, want to end up like Prince Charles. But the government may be ill-advised to avoid pledging support for museums and architecture centres, which have played such a crucial role in stimulating public interest in public buildings. </p> <p>Governments on the continent recognise a need to support both better design in public buildings, and cultural organisations such as the Paris Arsenal. In Britain, little money is directed at comparable organisations. Established cultural centres such as the Royal Institute of British Architects' architecture gallery, and Bristol's architecture centre, are struggling to keep their heads above water. </p> <p>And that fabled creature, a national architecture centre to rival those on the continent, remains somewhere over the rainbow. </p> <p>\u0095 Tom Dyckhoff is an architectural historian and deputy editor of Space, the Guardian's property and design supplement for the London area.

  "<p>Disadvantage and deprivation are far removed from the life of Ali Khaleeli.With his background, there seemed little risk of him catching tuberculosis, which is known as the disease of poverty. Born to a wealthy family in southern Iran, Khaleeli was educated at an English public school and vaccinated against TB when 16. And by 1991, when he started suffering a dry cough, he was a healthy, badminton-playing 45-year-old diabetes consultant living in a village in affluent Cheshire. </p> <p>Certainly he had come into contact with TB patients during his career - but so had tens of thousands of other medical staff. When an X-ray revealed a shadow on his lungs, therefore, both his radiologist and chest physician felt there was only one conclusion - Khaleeli had lung cancer. \"You do not see a lot of tuberculosis nowadays,\" the radiologist replied, when Khaleeli suggested he might have that disease. </p> <p>It was only one day later, when a groggy Khaleeli awoke from a biopsy operation, that he was told that, indeed, he did not have cancer but tuberculosis. \"Although I was still under the effects of the anaesthetic, I shouted with relief,\" Khaleeli recalls. \"The anaesthetist said he had never seen anyone so happy to be told they had tuberculosis.\" </p> <p>TB is usually easily treatable with antibiotics - so Khaleeli had reasons to be thankful. Nevertheless, his diagnosis fitted into the bigger picture causing concern to TB doctors - that this highly infectious disease is returning to Britain at an alarming rate. Moreover, hospitals up and down the country are under-prepared for its resurgence. </p> <p>According to Public Health Laboratory Service figures, TB cases have been growing rapidly over the last 10 years. In one year alone, 1998-1999, cases in England and Wales rose 20%, from 4,659 to 5,658. The disease is most prevalent in poor, deprived areas such as east London, which has the highest rate of TB in the country. </p> <p>This rise has evoked so much apprehension that, last year, TB Alert was formed, making it the first British TB charity since the 1960s. \"It is true to say that tuberculosis is a slow timebomb in the UK,\" warns Peter Davies of the Liverpool tuberculosis research unit at University Hospital, Aintree. \"If it continues to increase at the present rate, the incidence of TB will, in two or three generations' time, be five or ten times what it is now.\" </p> <p>Before the introduction of effective drugs in the 1950s, TB thrived in the poor social conditions during and after the industrial revolution. The bacteria killed one in four white Europeans and Americans. But now it is mostly non-whites, like Khaleeli, who are coming down with the disease in this country. More than half (56%) of cases are in people born outside Britain, particularly sub-Saharan Africa and Asia where TB can be rife and treatment poor. </p> <p>Despite opinion that poverty remains the most significant underlying cause of TB in this country, Davies, who treated Khaleeli, places more emphasis on biology. \"My hypothesis, which is highly contested, is that white European and Americans who survived TB passed on a genetic resistance to the disease to their children,\" he says. \"Asian and African people may not necessarily have this innate resistance. Therefore I think the rise of TB in the UK is down to migration, pure and simple.\" </p> <p>Aware that such scientific speculation may be seen as having racist overtones, he adds: \"We can get around claims of xenophobia by remembering that TB is essentially a European export. So, in a sense, it is a disease which is coming home.\" </p> <p>Above all, it is British doctors' lack of familiarity and expertise in dealing with TB that worries specialists such as Davies. World Health Organisation guidelines specify that, in order to tackle TB effectively, there must be an efficient system of diagnosis and thoroughness in ensuring patients complete their course of treatment. Yet last year the British Thoracic Society reported that only 14% of 43 health districts had minimum staffing levels necessary to treat TB. </p> <p>\"It is down to individual doctors to recognise tuberculosis - but we now have two generations of doctors who have not, in their professional lives, seen tuberculosis,\" says Davies. \"Training is just not adequate, and this is something that, over the last 10 years, has driven me to distraction.\" </p> <p>Tight treatment procedures are all the more urgent when ineffectively treated strains of the disease can mutate to become \"multi-drug resistant\" (MDR), making it difficult - and expensive - to fight. </p> <p>One case of MDR tuberculosis can cost \u00a3250,00 to treat. When New York suffered an MDR outbreak 11 years ago, it cost \u00a3110m over four years to control it. In Britain, MDR cases were unheard of five years ago. But now, according to Davies, one in 50 is MDR. \"All the more reason to pay attention to the rise of TB,\" he emphasises. </p> <p>\"We have just seen Prince Charles and other celebrities put their support behind an anti-bowel cancer charity. If only we could get that kind of publicity for tuberculosis. But it is not an issue people want to raise because it is seen as a problem for other countries. Well, it is not.\" </p> <p>A fully recovered Khaleeli, who is convinced he caught TB from one of his patients, is one doctor who has learned the lesson. Each year, he presents a lecture on tuberculosis to staff at Halton General Hospital, near Runcorn, where he works. He is also considering researching the proportion of Asian and African doctors and nurses who have been infected with TB, possibly from patients. </p> <p>\"The treatment of tuberculosis and other infectious diseases was one of the things that made the British health system so good,\" he says.\"But tuberculosis has reared its head again, and it is particularly important we are on the look-out for it among Asian and African people. Surveillance is so vital to prevent its spread.\" </p> <p> <strong>Killer in the air</strong> <br></p> <p> \u0095 The tuberculosis bacteria spreads through water droplets in the air from coughs, sneezes or contaminated food. It causes fever, fatigue, loss of appetite and weight, night sweats and a persistent cough, with blood produced. </p> <p>\u0095 Overcrowding, inadequate sanitation, poor living conditions and homelessness are breeding grounds for the TB bacteria. </p> <p>\u0095 In 1993, the World Health Organisation declared TB, which kills 3m people a year, a global emergency. Infection with Aids virus HIV, which depresses the immune system, makes a TB carrier 30 times more likely to become sick with the disease. One in three Aids deaths is caused by TB.</p>",
  "<p> The European Commission has cleared the merger between AOL and Time Warner after the companies removed its concerns about the new group dominating the market for music downloads over the internet.</p> <p>Competition commissioner Mario Monti was finally satisfied that AOL's offer to sever all links with German media company Bertelsmann and its BMG record label would prevent a monopoly of music downloads. </p> <p>The collapse of the \u00a314bn joint venture between record label EMI and Time Warner subsidiary Warner Music also raised the merger's chance of success.</p> <p>Mr Monti said: \"In a music market already characterised by a high degree of consolidation, the danger, which has been averted, was that by allowing AOL to team up effectively with three of the five music majors, the resulting integrated company could have dominated the on-line music distribution market and music players.\"</p> <p>Today's events have underlined that Mr Monti's key concerns centred on music and the internet. The commission said in a statement that AOL and Time Warner did not have the infrastructure to block access to the internet broadband network and that Time Warner was not in a position to dominate the market for video content over the web.</p> <p>One analyst said: \"The commission effectively said drop the EMI deal and we will wave it through.

  "<p> Six-to-four the field, six-to-one bar! Shouting the odds, the TV and my father, low down on the living room floor. </p> <p> C'mon, baby! he yells, beating his flank with his fist. With the betting slip in his teeth, he gallops down the last furlong of the rug, to the home straight of the lino. Words bolt from the side of his mouth: Yankee Piggott Photo-finish. I don't understand any of it: I think my father's English leaves a lot to be desired. </p> <p> He curses: Jesus Christ. </p> <p> At the end of the race, his face is very flushed, an inch from the set. He's watching the lines and dots as if Barney's Boy will suddenly leap through the screen. Ripping pink shreds of paper from his mouth, my father tears up his slip and spits the remains on the rug. Then he starts in on the Sporting Life, holding it out in front of him, rending it between his fists until he's tearing air. I know at these moments that he would tear me too, for the slightest thing, and I crawl ever so slowly behind the couch, until he's put on his donkey jacket and slammed the back door. </p> <p> He isn't just like this about horses. My father will gamble on anything that moves. He won't do Bingo or fruit machines or snow on Christmas Day, but horses and pontoon and poker and dogs. My father's love is Chance. Look at that roulette wheel! Bet red, bet black, bet red, bet black. If he could place his bet Under Starter's Orders he would still change his mind over every fence. The Form makes no difference, the words don't make sense, and the odds at Joe Coral have no bearing on his stake. </p> <p> He has always been this way, according to my mother. She made her own bet on him, in November 1948, in the church of St Mark's, in a white lace gown. </p> <p> * * * </p> <p> This is what happens just before I am born: it's 1960. My parents, Frankie and Mary, have five beautiful daughters, and a half-share in a cafe overlooking Cardiff docks. Salvatore Capanone, my father's oldest friend, owns the other half. The sailors on shore leave pour in through the red door to eat, and find a girl. My family lives above the cafe. They have two rooms; one long one, divided into bedroom and lounge by a thick toile curtain depicting scenes of the French aristocracy, and an airless back room which they call The Pit, because you have to climb down into it. My sisters inhabit The Pit, and my father has put a gate up in the doorway to stop Luca, who's only two years old, from climbing up the steps and falling down again. Luca swings her fat leg over the gate whenever my mother isn't looking, and falls from that instead. </p> <p> There is a third room, one more flight up. It has a square wooden table covered with worn green felt, and four vinyl-backed chairs stacked one upon the other. In the far corner is a window where a blind conceals the day. My mother never goes into this room; it's not hers to use. </p> <p> There is no kitchen. Every morning my mother trudges downstairs to the cafe to fetch food for my sisters to eat, which they do, sitting in a long line on the couch and watching the Test Card on the television in the corner, while she moves her washing from surface to surface, doing her impression of someone who is tidy. My father's old sea chest is the only storage space, filled with baby clothes. I'll be wearing them soon. My mother knows this, but she doesn't want to air the clothes because my father doesn't. Also, she's determined that I'm a boy this time, and so a lot of the shawls and bonnets and little woollen coats will be redundant, being mainly pink. </p> <p> Celesta, who's eleven going on forty, is helping to get Marina and Rose ready for school. They look like two turnips in their cream-coloured balaclava hats, and Celesta doesn't want to be seen with them. She wears a straw boater with a chocolate-brown ribbon, bought for when she goes to Our Lady's Convent School. She won't start there until next term, by which time the boater will have a distinctly weathered look, but at the moment she wears it all the time, even in bed. Fran has just begun at primary school. She draws angry pictures of bonfires using three crayons at a time. My mother pays no attention to this, having to deal with Luca now, and the prospect of me later. </p> <p> When the other children leave, my mother squashes Luca into her hip and goes downstairs to the cafe. She unbolts the front door, slipping off the heavy chain which swings against the wood, and paces the narrow aisle between the tables. At the furthest end, where the daylight doesn't stretch, are two booths and a long counter. Close to its brass lip sit a single smeared tumbler and a half-empty bottle of Advocaat. The air is sweetish here. A sleeveless Peggy Lee is propped against the gramophone in the corner - Salvatore has had a late night. </p> <p> My mother eases Luca into her high chair, and as soon as she is down, with the rush of cold around her thigh, she screams. She won't stop until she has something sticky on bread, or until my father comes back from the market and swings her in his arms. Luca can't understand why she isn't allowed to practise running. Salvatore used to let her, when my mother had to go and fetch Fran, or hunt the Bookies for my father. </p> <p> Frankie and Salvatore are a strange brace. My father is smooth and lean, well cut in his well-cut suit. His partner is softer, larger, with milky hands and brimming eyes. Every morning Salvatore puts a clean white handkerchief in the pocket of his apron to deal with the tears which will flow through the day. He blames the heat of the kitchen, rather than his childless wife or the plaintive tones of Mario Lanza. The air is full of music when Salvatore cooks. He plays Dino and Sammy, endless Sinatra, and his favourite, Louis Prima, who reminds him of somewhere not quite like home. The records are stacked in the plate rack on top of the counter, the plates haphazardly stowed beneath. Salvatore glides through the days and nights, dusting flour into the grooves of Julie London, wiping her clean with his napkin. And then he wipes his eyes. </p> <p> There is a delicate division of labour in this business. Salvatore is a better cook than Frankie, for whom the flames of the kitchen are too much like his vision of Hell. So while Salvatore cuts his fingers, brands the soft flesh of his forearm on the searing stove, and sings and cries, Frankie wears his suit and does things with money upstairs. But Salvatore likes it this way, he gets to see people. </p> <p> * * * </p> <p> At first, convinced that it would tempt the passers-by, Salvatore made stews and bread and almond cakes dusted with sugar. He wedged the red door open with a bar stool, wafting the smell of baking out into the street with his tea-towel. He wrote a sign, DELICIOUS FOOD, in a careful hand, and tied it with parcel string around the rusted frame of the awning outside. But Mack the Knife spilt out on to the pavement, upsetting the barber shop owner next door, the sign ran in the rain, and soon Salvatore brought the stool back to the bar. The pigeons in the yard grew fat on unbought food. </p> <p> Never mind, said my mother. It takes time. </p> <p> Now he cooks for the sailors, who want egg and chips or bacon in starchy white rolls, and the cafe is busy. Sailors bring in girls, and girls attract trade. Salvatore fries everything in the flat black pan on the, stove, his thinning hair stuck to his head with steam. The combed strands come unglued throughout the day, falling one by one in lank array over his left ear. He pretends to be a widower so that the night girls will pity him. In fact he is married to Carlotta, who is respectable, and will not enter The Port of Call, our cafe. Or as Carlotta calls it in her broken English, That Den-o-Sin. </p> <p> * * * </p> <p> Salvatore loves my mother and my father and my sisters. He is part of the family. And he will love me too, when I am born. Until then, he has to make do with Luca, who shrieks from her high chair the moment my mother's back is turned. Salvatore watches from a safe distance as Luca's arms jolt up and down in an urgent plea to be lifted. He would free her, but he daren't. The last time he did, she ran like a river to the end of the cafe and caught her head on the edge of a table. She stared at it, astonished, while her forehead bulged and split. The knock held her silent for two days, so silent, my mother thought she was damaged: it was the only time Luca was quiet. </p> <p> Now when my mother has to go out, she traps Luca in The Pit with soft toys to keep her happy for the five minutes she thinks she will be away. Luca throws them at the furthest wall, screaming like a bomb. </p> <p> In search of my father, my mother is blunt and shaming. She no longer has the time to be discreet. </p> <p> Have you seen Frankie? Len the Bookie? In The Bute, are they? Righto. She tracks down her husband, to the arcade, the coffee house, the back room of the pub. When she finds him, she is vocal. My father complains. </p> <p> This is business, Mary. Keep out of it. The other men look down and grin into their shirts. And when my father does return, my mother points to Luca's head. </p> <p> That's down to you, that is. Sufficiently shamed, or just tired of losing, Frankie starts a clean sheet. He stops betting; he has finished with it for good. But when my mother tells him about me (at six months the evidence is mounting), he takes the money he's accumulated through not gambling and opens a card school in the top room of the cafe. He wins, and wins. And suddenly I am luck personified. </p> <p> We'll call him Fortuno, he says, rubbing my mother's stomach as if she's harbouring the Golden Egg. My mother has other ideas. </p> <p> * * * </p> <p> In the top room, all four chairs are occupied. There is a haze of cheroots, a sweat of onions, the stink of eggs in oil. My father has staked everything on the winning of the game. Away in the infirmary, I'm wailing at the midwife as Frankie decides to Twist. My mother is straining with the labour of prayer. Over and over. </p> <p> Oh God, let it be a boy. </p> <p> When the midwife pulls me out, she conceals me. I am shunted from scales to blanket to anteroom. She closes the door on my mother. </p> <p> If you have to tell her anything, tell her it's a boy, says the midwife to the nurse. </p> <p> Salvatore's wife Carlotta, waiting in the corridor with her big black handbag poised on the bulge of her stomach, catches just this one phrase - tell her it's a boy - and makes a phone-call to the cafe. </p> <p> Salvatore is watching the card game from the doorway upstairs, peeping through the curtain of beads which hangs from the lintel. They cascade from his shoulders like Madonna tears. He doesn't hear the telephone; his mind is in anguish for the game he's not allowed to play. His eyes are fixed on the Brylcreem glint which crowns my father's head. Salvatore's right hand rests stiff across his heart, his left holds a spatula, which oozes slow drips on to the red linoleum floor. He should be downstairs making greasy meals for the thin night girls, but Salvatore cannot concentrate on bacon and eggs when his business is at stake. </p> <p> * * * </p> <p> Salvatore likes his partner Frankie, even though he's lazy and not always dependable, and he adores the night girls downstairs. The young ones perch on the stools, their bouffant heads nodding in time to the music on the gramophone; they are stiff-lacquered, clean-scented. The older ones smile, now and then flinging an arm across the booths to display their latest Solitaires. Or they sit in silence. They draw their wet fingers round the rim of their glasses, in an effort to make the last rum last. </p> <p> Rita, Sophia, Gina. Salvatore recites the girls' names in his sing-song voice. These women are really Irene and Lizzie and Pat. They close around the green metal ashtrays, depressing the buttons with their jewelled hands, watching the debris swirl into the hidden bowl below. When they do leave, the imprints of their bored thighs remain a while upon the shiny leatherette. They never say thank you and they never look back. Salvatore always forgives them. He wipes his hands down the breast of his apron, and sings through the night, while Frankie gambles in the room above his head. </p> <p> * * * </p> <p> Tonight, Salvatore wants to watch. Here we have my father, the giant Martineau, Ilya the Pole, and crooked Joe Medora. This pack of men is busy. </p> <p> Sal ... telephone, says Joe, not looking up. Salvatore rolls reluctantly downstairs. </p> <p> Joe Medora wears a slouch hat, a silk scarf anchored at the neck, a Savile Row suit. He's an archetypal villain who makes sure he looks the part. He angles his cigar into the side of his lipless mouth, staring over his Hand. He's seen all the films; no gesture is wasted. He is patient. </p> <p> It's my father's move. Jack of Hearts, Five of Clubs, Four - winking - Diamonds. </p> <p> It's a boy! cries Salvatore, beating back upstairs. Bambino, Frankie! </p> <p> And my father, who is Frankie Bambina to his friends, poor unlucky Frank to have so many daughters, Twists in reckless joy, and loses the cafe, the shoebox under the floorboards full with big money, his own father's ruby ring, and my mother's white lace gown, to Joe Medora. </p> <p> At least I have a son, he thinks, as he rolls the ring across the worn green felt. </p> <p> * * * </p> <p> My father stands above my cot with a clenched fist and a stiff smile. He rubs his left hand along the lining of his pocket, feeling the absence of his father's ring and the nakedness of losing. </p> <p> At the end of the ward, Salvatore's face appears in the porthole of the swing door. Carlotta's face fills the other, and for a moment they stare separately at the rows and rows of beds and cots. Carlotta lets out a shout, Mary! Frankie!, and sweeps towards my parents. Salvatore raises his hand in salute, but takes his time, pausing to exchange greetings with the other mothers. </p> <p> A fine baby, Missus! </p> <p> What a beauty! Boy or girl? </p> <p> Twins? How lucky! There aren't enough babies in the ward for Salvatore, perhaps not in the world. He bends over each one with his big smile and his hands clasped at his back. </p> <p> Carlotta spreads herself on the chair next to my mother's bed and rummages deep into her bag. She makes small talk, not trusting herself to mention me, or the cafe, or the future. My father stabs his teeth with a broken matchstick he's found in the other pocket of his trousers, and sucks air, and says nothing. No one looks at me. Then Salvatore approaches the foot of my mother's bed and opens his arms wide to embrace my father. Both men lean into each other, quietly choking. Carlotta produces a dented red box from her bag, prises off the lid, and offers my mother a chocolate. </p> <p> Please have one, Mary. They're your favourites. </p> <p> Mary is in a state of mute blankness. A girl baby, yet again. In her head, she wonders what to call me - she's exhausted her list of Saints' names on the boys she never bore, and is sick of all the arias in the names her girls have got. Dolores drifts up in miserable smoke. </p> <p> Salvatore rests a hand upon my mother's arm and gazes into my cot. The pink matinee jacket is fastened too tight around my neck; it reeks of mothballs. Wearing his best suit for the visit (which is also the one he wears to funerals), Salvatore smells the same as me. He lands great kisses on my forehead and holds me up for inspection, cajoling my mother. </p> <p> See, Mary! So pretty! </p> <p> My mother fixes on the flaking paint of the radiator, and wishes we would all go away. Frankie, too, has had enough of Cooing and Aahing. He puts his hand on Salvatore's chest and shunts him back down the ward. He presses so hard, Salvatore feels the buttons of his shirt indent his skin. </p> <p> Mary is in shock, my father tells them. Better leave her alone. This is nothing compared to the shock she'll get when she finds out she's homeless, and her wedding dress adorns a bottle-blonde from Llanelli. </p> <p> * * * </p> <p>I am a week old when everything changes. My parents move into a run-down house at one end of a winding street. The other end is dead, sealed by a high wall spun with barbed wire. Joe Medora owns our new house, and our old cafe. The rent increases on a whim: when Joe gambles on a loser, it goes up. But it can go up when he bets on a winner, too. </p> <p> My father is put in the Box Room: it is a cell. Celesta and Marina and Rose have the back bedroom. One window overlooks the road, where Rose leans out to spit on unsuspecting heads. Marina springs up and down on her bed, tearing off the wallpaper in long strips, while Celesta puts her fingers in her ears, reads The Book of Common Ailments, and convinces herself that she is dying. </p> <p> The front bedroom becomes Our Room, my mother and Fran and Luca and me. Fran has the bed in the corner, and Luca has exclusive rights over my mother, who puts me in the chest. When she's convinced that I'll survive the night, I'm allowed to share the bed. </p> <p> * * * </p> <p> Carlotta is recruited in these difficult times, apparently to look after us children. She's really here to make sure my mother is a Good Wife who doesn't desert her fallen-on-hard-times husband: my mother might at any second run away with, say, the Coalman. This is prescient, but not in the way Carlotta thinks. </p> <p> For now, Salvatore still works at the cafe, renamed The Moonlight Club in sputtering neon, and he leaves his friend Frankie alone. But he thinks about us, he worries about me, and he asks Carlotta every night for a report. </p> <p> Getting big now, Carlotta says, stretching her arms out like a fisherman to show how I'm growing. </p> <p> Salvatore is not entirely convinced, and once a week he sends Carlotta with a parcel of food, stolen from his shifts at The Moonlight. He feels he is entitled; after all, he's still a partner in the business. Except these days, working with Joe Medora, he feels more like a slave. </p> <p> While my mother takes to her bed and stares at the ceiling, Carlotta cooks up a steam in the little kitchen. She makes baked pasta with blackened edges, solid slabs of home-made bread. Everything she provides is sharp and hard, as if to counteract the softness of her body and the thick roll of her voice. My mother thinks of little, but she listens. She hears the sticky cough of the woman in her kitchen, and imagines Carlotta dipping her feelers in the cooking pot, testing the saltiness of the ham. </p> <p> It is about this time that I am burnt. </p>",

  "A picture of a set of tightly gritted teeth ought to have accompanied today's reports that Gordon Brown is planning to hand some sort of sop to rural motorists and the haulage industry. The chancellor may see the political necessity of staving off petrol protestors, whose 60-day deadline for government action expires on 13 November, but you can be sure that he's not happy about taking a dent in his iron reputation. <p>That's why his plan, which is said to involve cutting the road tax paid by some motorists in the most distant, rural parts of the country from \u00a3155 to \u00a345, is so insignificant. Affecting virtually no one, it will appease just as few motorists - and many of those who may benefit will not need the aid, anyway. The plan may well mean cheaper motoring for the Queen at Balmoral and the Duke of Westminster on his highland estate, but for the rest of us it might as well not exist.</p> <p>As a result, motoring organisations, who represent rather more suburban Mondeo drivers than green-wellied Land Rover owners, have attacked the plan even before it has been properly announced. Motoring lobby groups such as the AA want cheaper petrol for all, achieved either by lowering the world price of oil (which is beyond even New Labour's powers) or by cutting tax to levels found elsewhere in Europe. Even the Tories' promise of a 3p cut is hardly enough to sate them. </p> <p>There is no way that the present chancellor is going to grant even that. Whether he is persuaded by the environmental case for high levels of energy taxation is open to doubt. What is certain, though, is that he enjoys seeing the government's coffers fill with the motorists' gold, and enjoys his unbending reputation even more. </p> <p>But though Gordon Brown is part fiscal-strongman, he is also part politician, a would-be prime minister in a government that wants a second term above almost anything else. When New Labour loses seats next May, the chancellor will take some of the blame; and perhaps most of it if his refusal to deal with the cost of motoring becomes a big election issue. </p> <p>As a result he has shifted from his position last month, which was to dismiss all talk of changing motoring taxes as political blackmail, downplaying even the vague promise of doing something in his autumn statement. His new plan to help rural drivers may be only the start, a way of breaking the political ice and introducing the idea that he will act. The oldest political trick in the book is to lead everyone to think you are going to do very little and then suddenly do quite a lot. </p> <p>The chancellor may be playing this game. His \"secret\" meeting with representatives of the haulage industry last Friday, also uncovered today, may be part of it. </p> <p>So may be suggestions that the prime minister has \"told\" the chancellor to do something about the problem. These may make Tony Blair look like a leader, but they also make him part of the cave-in if one comes about. \"It wasn't my fault, mate. The other guy made me swerve,\" is a standard line to give the police after a car crash.</p> <p>Gordon Brown may be about to employ it to get out of the government's recent political calamity, too.</p>",
  "<p>Increasing tension in the Middle East sent the price of oil surging on global markets last night, re-igniting fears of higher inflation in the developed economies. </p> <p>Saudi Arabia's warning that it would not remain aloof in the event of an Israeli attack on Lebanon or Syria helped to send the cost of a barrel of crude up almost a dollar to $32.79 (\u00a322.60) in New York. </p> <p>Earlier the International Energy Agency set alarm bells ringing when it said the West was heading into winter with inventories well below the seasonal norm. </p> <p>\"Fundamentals are tight and the market is fragile. The system is strained and running hard just to keep even. Vigilance is the order of the day,\" the IEA said. </p> <p>Oil prices have retreated from their 10-year peaks last month after pressure from the G7 industrial nations on pro ducers to pump more crude and the US decision to release 30m barrels from its strategic reserve. </p> <p>After briefly dipping below $30, prices have risen amid concerns that demand will exceed supply in the coming months, particularly if the violence in Israel leads to a broader conflict. </p> <p>\"Refiners can only process so much crude; ships, barges and pipelines can only transport so much product,\" the IEA said yesterday. </p> <p>\"The global energy market is coming to grips with the reality that there are physical lim its on what can be accomplished this winter.\" </p> <p>Oil prices are seen as a threat to the prospects of low inflation in the West, and yesterday's increases spilled over into bond markets, where worries about Wall Street and energy shortages had already driven yields higher. </p> <p>Britain and Germany yesterday reported higher than expected inflation figures, reflecting the recent surge in the cost petrol. Ernst Welteke, the Bundesbank president, said: \"I hope that no inflation expectations will build up in bond yields and wage demands.\"</p>",
  "This war is far from over; indeed, it may have only just begun. The peacemakers and diplomats are piling into Israel - Robin Cook arrives today - talking of calm. But the stone-throwing and shooting has not stopped. Yesterday another Palestinian boy, this time a nine-year-old, took a bullet in the head. Dread and panic still stalk the promised land. <p>The blame game rages on. For Palestinians, and much of world opinion, the culprit is clear: Likud leader Ariel Sharon started the trouble by swaggering onto that contested patch of holy Jerusalem turf revered by Jews as the Temple Mount and by Muslims as the site of the Al-Aqsa mosque. Sharon's crime has been compounded by an Israeli military which has used jeeps, tanks and even helicopters to rain down rubber bullets and worse on prepubescent boys armed with nothing more than rocks and slingshots. </p> <p>Most Israelis see it differently. The left admits that Sharon lit that fateful first spark and that the Israeli army has since used excessive force. But that leaves plenty of blame left to go round. They point the finger at Yasser Arafat and his Palestinian Authority. He has 40,000 policeman at his disposal, a quasi-army which could have quelled the Al-Aqsa uprising before it had even started. Arafat has crushed dissent among his own people before, he could have done it again. Nor, adds Israeli opinion, did Palestinian TV have to stoke the fires of rebellion by broadcasting archive pictures of the 1987-93 intifada: a kind of how-to guide to the new generation. </p> <p>There is almost no common ground between these two views, as Kofi Annan and co are doubtless discovering. But if consensus is impossible on the causes of the current war, agreement may be more likely on what it has cost. </p> <p>Everyone can see that more than a hundred people, mostly Palestinians, have lost their lives. They can agree, too, that the tentative trust that took seven years to build since the Oslo accords has evaporated, that both sides have returned to the hardline positions of more than a decade ago. Suddenly Israelis who had made a reluctant peace with the idea of an eventual Palestinian state are having second thoughts: that police force, they now fear, could soon be a full-fledged hostile army, on Israel's doorstep. For their part, Palestinians who had come to accept a two-state solution - one for them, one for the Israelis - are now back on a 1970s agenda, demanding Israel's destruction. </p> <p>There are two deeper shifts, which could well be felt for decades to come. The first is the well-documented inclusion of Arab citizens of Israel in the current rebellion. For 52 years, through five wars, the so-called Israeli Arabs kept their counsel, enduring often grotesque discrimination. They did not join the struggle of their cousins on the West Bank and Gaza; the intifada never spread inside Israel's borders. Their position was always ambiguous - members of the Palestinian people, yet citizens of a Jewish state - but they maintained it. Not now. The 52-year balancing act is over: the Palestinians of Israel are in revolt, too. </p> <p>The second, related shift is even more troubling. When Arafat and Israel's Ehud Barak met at Camp David in July they sat as two neighbours engaged in a land dispute, secular politicians tussling over borders and maps. Now the battle is no longer about real estate, but theology. The dispute over Jerusalem has turned a national conflict into a religious war - Jew against Muslim. Such a conflict does not recognise the \"green line\" that separates Israel proper from its occupied territories; it engulfs the Arabs of Haifa as well as Hebron. What's worse, it takes the Israel-Palestine conflict into a realm impervious to the secular, rational solutions of modern diplomacy: we have entered the realm of jihad. </p> <p>This spells doom for both sides. Barak's position has been rendered all but untenable. He was elected last year on a promise to make peace; he went further than any Israeli ever before to achieve that goal - and now he has been made to look a fool. He withdrew from Lebanon, agreeing an unofficial accord with Hezbollah, only for that group to kidnap three Israeli soldiers. He discussed with Arafat a deal that would have seen further Jewish holy sites placed under the protection of the Palestinian authority: after Joseph's Tomb in Nablus was sacked on Saturday - with Palestinians tearing the pages from Jewish prayer books - few Israelis will allow Barak to sign such a pact now. They will demand that Jewish holy sites remain under Jewish protection. </p> <p>Similarly, Barak was beginning to prepare Israelis to right a historic wrong: the dispossession of hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees. Israelis were realising they would eventually have to open their doors and let those Palestinians return home. \"Now it is clear it would be madness,\" wrote Ze'ev Schiff for the left-leaning Ha'aretz newspaper yesterday, \"to add to [Israel's] Arab minority\" after so many have \"raised the banner of revolt.\" The last fortnight has convinced Israelis that the Arabs among them are a fifth column, and Barak cannot be seen to add to their ranks. </p> <p>Not that this is good news for Arafat. He will not be able to ride this wave of Muslim anger forever: if there is a jihad in Palestine, his people will want Hamas, not a secularist like him, to lead it. More immediately, can he not see what this confirmation of Israelis' worst fears will lead to? Does he not realise that the last two weeks have been the model election campaign for a new Likud government, headed by Sharon or a reborn Binyamin Netanyahu? </p> <p>Which brings us back to the blame game. For perhaps the real culprits are those two would-be peacemakers, Barak and Arafat. Neither man realised that doves must be as tough as hawks - that in proposing compromise they must be as unbending as the rejectionists who would do nothing. Barak should have barred Sharon from his walkabout. He should have maintained his surveillance operation on the border with Lebanon. He needed to do all this not to be a warlord, but to be a peacemaker - to prevent the violence that would make his own people fear compromise. </p> <p>The same applies to Arafat. He needed to push aside Hamas and the other rejectionists and to prevent the sacking of Joseph's Tomb - if only to reassure the Israelis with whom he is seeking an accommodation. But he should also have quieted the holy war propaganda, which can only make his fellow Palestinians regard his dealings with the Israeli enemy as treachery. Instead he has fed the appetite for jihad, so that even his own achievement in Oslo is in peril. </p> <p>There is a lesson here for peacemakers everywhere, including Northern Ireland. Those proposing compromise have to bend over backwards to provide security, to reassure their own side that peace is a risk they can afford to take. For if they slip up, their people will not easily agree to compromise next time: they won't be fooled again. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:jonathan.freedland@theguardian.com\">jonathan.freedland@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The United Kingdom has a bad record in dealing with its rubbish compared with other European countries. </p> <p>In the 90s, international pressure stopped the dumping of chemical and sewage waste directly into the North sea, a practice that had led the UK under Mrs Thatcher to be dubbed the \"dirty man of Europe\". On land, nothing has changed. </p> <p>While Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands forge ahead with recycling, composting and using waste to generate energy, the UK carries on dumping in landfill sites. The result is that this country is years behind the best in Europe in dealing with the growing mountain of domestic and commercial waste. And we are failing to gain the new industries and jobs that active recycling of rubbish brings. </p> <p>The explanation is lack of political will both at national and local level and an easy option - lots of big holes of the ground. </p> <p>Take a country with virtually no available holes and no forgiving sea to dump things in - Switzerland. A crisis seen approaching more than 20 years ago led to every option for disposing of waste being explored there. By 1995 the Swiss were already recycling 31% of their waste, composting another 11% and burning 45% to make energy. The ash from the incinerators is recycled as hardcore for roads and construction. The remainder of the rubbish - a mere 13% - is buried. </p> <p>In the UK at the end of last year only 8% of waste was recycled, 8% burned to make electricity and - in a nation of gardeners - only 1% composted to improve the soil. This left 83% simply being dumped in holes. </p> <p>There are wide regional disparities. Hampshire began running out of holes in which to dump waste five years ago and is now hoping to hit 40% recycling by 2003. Scotland, with plenty of dumps, remains below 4% in recycling. </p> <p>It is not that the Blair government or its predecessor have done nothing. Both have had waste reduction targets at which local authorities were supposed to aim. Both favoured more incinerators to burn waste and generate electricity. The Tories wanted to recycle or compost a quarter of all waste by 2000. They introduced the first green tax, a landfill charge that was supposed to make options other than dumping more attractive. It did not work. Realising the ambition was unattainable John Prescott deferred the 25% target date to 2005. But his replacement strategy faces problems too. </p> <p>Pressure on the UK has come from a series of European Union directives intended to restrict use of excessive packaging and so cut the ever-climbing amounts of waste a consumer society throws away. To comply with the latest EU landfill directive the government has set new targets for recovering and recycling materials. More waste has to be converted into energy. By 2005, 40% of waste must be recovered or burned. The target for 2010 is 45% and 67% by 2015. </p> <p>Subsidies are available for recycling; best practice is being highlighted and laggard councils chased up. It is estimated that between 100 and 200 new materials recovery facilities are needed - places that sort cans, plastics and other recyclable items. Between 150 and 300 new composting plants should be provided - a tall order for local authorities with other priorities on how to spend their limited funds. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the other main plank of official policy, incineration, is in deep trouble. The idea of reducing waste bulk by burning it while at the same time generating electricity is appealing. The problem in the UK is that there has been successful and continuing opposition that may veto any expansion. </p> <p>On Monday, Greenpeace closed down the largest waste-to-energy plant in the UK at Edmonton, which burns 38.5% of the waste produced by eight north London boroughs. The public authority that runs it wants to expand, aiming to burn around 60% of the boroughs' waste - some 850,000 tonnes of rubbish a year. The boroughs want to increase recycling beyond their current performance, which at 14% is already over the average: add the incineration increase and this part of London would reach European standards. Provided, that is, Edmonton can overcome a Greenpeace campaign that yesterday won the support of mayor Ken Livingstone. </p> <p>This is likely to be a test case. There are 15 similar if smaller plants elsewhere and the government wants a dramatic increase in that figure. Whitehall is hoping for some 100 additional waste-to-electricity schemes. More than 60 have planning permission. But Greenpeace, together with protest groups throughout the country, points to the body of evidence that associates waste-to-energy schemes with the release of toxins into the atmosphere. Dioxins, which can cause cancer and birth defects, have been cited in particular. </p> <p>With waste-to-energy schemes an accepted part of waste management elsewhere in Europe, the UK's plan is in trouble even before it has been properly established. Many councils look like falling back on reuse of waste and recycling as the best available options. </p> <p>Experience in Europe and North America, where just about every variant has been exhaustively tested, shows that the maximum level of recycling that is economically efficient is 40%. No one quarrels with composting, though most are a way off the performance of Austria with 14% of waste ground down as soil supplements. What is left is burning the waste or dumping it in landfill sites. </p> <p>\u0095 Paul Brown is the Guardian's environment correspondent </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:paul.brown@theguardian.com\">paul.brown@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The world's biggest corporate merger - the tie-up between internet company <a href=\"http://www.aol.com/\" target=\"_NEW\"> America Online</a> and media group <a href=\"http://www.timewarner.com/corp/\" target=\"_NEW\">Time Warner</a> - is today expected to be approved by the European commission after months of wrangling. </p> <p>Mario Monti, the competition comissioner, is expected to say the \u00a387bn deal can go ahead after extracting concessions designed to ensure that the new company's rivals will not be unfairly disadvantaged. </p> <p>Last week's collapse of the related \u00a314bn tie-up between EMI Music and Warner Music in the face of stiff regulatory opposition from Brussels removed the commission's fears that AOL-Time Warner will be able to monopolise the market for entertainment delivery over the net. </p> <p>The deal still faces regulatory hurdles in the US. The federal trade commission has said it may scupper the merger unless it is assured that Time Warner will allow rivals to lease some of its cable lines which run into people's homes. That the companies have been willing to compromise with European regulators suggests that they will also be ready to allay Washington's concerns. </p> <p>To win Mr Monti's blessing, AOL, already the world's largest internet company, has reportedly agreed to sever links with Bertelsmann, the German media groupwhich owns 50% of AOL Europe. </p> <p>Such a concession would effectively prevent any potential for collusion between Warner Music and Bertlesmann's BMG, one of the world's top five record labels. </p> <p>A similar restructuring of AOL's French unit, which it runs with Vivendi, is on the cards and AOL has reportedly agreed not to force content providers in the US to sign exclusive carriage deals with AOL Europe. </p> <p>Time Warner, for its part, has said it will not discriminate against non-AOL internet service providers who want to distribute its music online for a period of five years. </p> <p>The commission's decision to clear the deal will go some way to defuse American suspicions that European regulators are deliberately seeking to hold up internet-related mergers to give their own companies time to catch up. </p> <p>Such a charge was levelled at Brussels when it decided to block the telecoms tie-up between MCI/Worldcom and Sprint earlier this year, stating that it feared the merged entity would dominate the internet's backbone. That ruling is now under appeal. </p> <p>The EC is expected to clear a similar deal on Friday - Vivendi's \u00a320bn takeover of Canada's Seagram which owns Universal Music and pay-TV station Canal-Plus. </p> <p>This deal raised similar concerns, but Vivendi has now made a series of significant concessions and the acquisition looks likely to be given a green light.</p>",

  "\u0095 Alexander Walker objects to your description of Leni Riefenstahl as a \"Nazi filmmaker\" as being inaccurate (Letters, October 9). However, Goebbels structured all communications and cultural life through \"guilds\" which excluded Jews, communists and other undesirables, but which totally controlled work. Riefenstahl was, of course, a member. He then actively discouraged people like her from joining the party in order to fool the public about their independence. <p>Contrary to Walker's claims, Riefenstahl's relationship with the Nazi leadership was deep and abiding and antedated their coming to power. It included invoking the aid of the notorious anti-semite and Gauleiter of Nuremberg, Julius Streicher, to silence Bela Balacz, the Jewish direc tor of Riefenstahl's biggest hit as an actress, the 1932 film The Blue Light. Walker is however correct when he states that Goebbels disliked her. There was good reason for this. She got in the way of his propaganda plans and had, dangerously, direct access to Hitler. Her persuasiveness was legendary and certainly bamboozled US de-Nazifiers. </p> <p>And in 1941, for her film Tiefland, she took 60 Romanies out of a small holding concentration camp, the Maxglan Lager near Salzburg, to use as extras. She returned these families to the camp system where most died. The survivors were filmed by Nina Gladitz for her 1987 documentary Time of Darkness and Silence, which is a potent rebuttal of Riefenstahl's endlessly hawked protestations of innocence and ignorance. </p> <p>\"Nazi filmmaker\" seems like a pretty accurate description. </p> <p><b>Prof Brian Winston </b><br> University of Westminster <br><a href=\"mailto:winstob@wmin.ac.uk\">winstob@wmin.ac.uk</a> </p> <p> </p> <p>\u0095No matter how great a contribution to cinematography we believe Leni Riefenstahl to have made (and to me she is one of the greatest directors ever to have lived), to this day she is totally unable to understand why one cannot divorce art from politics striving to promote the Aryan superhuman while professing ignorance and shock at the inevitable and tragic outcome of the movement built upon this fascist aesthetic. </p> <p>Riefenstahl's socialising with the Nazi leadership in the 1930s is documented in Goebbels's diaries and elsewhere. She adored \"our Fuhrer\" from their first meet ing in 1932 to her visit to the Berghof in 1944, agreed with Hitler's policies as expressed in Mein Kampf and wrote in 1939 of her \"indescribable joy\" as Nazi troops marched down the Champs Elysees. And, to correct Alexander Walker, Riefenstahl was exhonerated of party membership but was found guilty of complicity as a sympathiser at the Freibourg de-Nazification trials. </p> <p>This twisted genius taught many of us a great deal about cinematography and taught the BBC outside broadcast unit almost everything it knows. But, as the son of a Jewish refugee, I was troubled enough buying Riefenstahl's films, without having to stomach a whitewashing of this 98-year-old apologist for the 1,000-Year Reich. </p> <p><b>Mike Green</b><br> London</p>",
  "\u0095 Larry Elliott is in danger of overheating when he says the European Central Bank is as remote as the court of Louis XIV (ECB should change its tune, October 9). I drafted the European parliament's first report on the ECB and agree that it is less open than, say, the US Federal Reserve or the Bank of England. But Mr Elliott fails to give the ECB any credit for its monthly bulletin, regular press conferences, quarterly appearances before the European parliament's economic and monetary affairs committee, or for its agreement to adopt two of the five transparency measures that the parliament requested: publication of regular forecasts and of its econometric models. <p>The ECB council should certainly publish minutes and its voting records and I think this will eventually happen. But Mr Elliott's notion that the council should traipse around all 12 euro-area national parliaments is absurd: it would be like asking the federal open markets committee to appear before each of the 50 state congresses rather than before the house and senate banking committees. Mr Elliott is very welcome either to attend one of Mr Wim Duisenberg's quarterly hearings in the European parliament, or to tune in to one of the several channels that carry it live. He would evidently be surprised. </p> <p>Nor does the 0-2% inflation target institutionalise deflation, as Mr Elliott suggests. The euro area's growth this year is the highest for 10 years and has now exceeded UK growth for nine straight quarters. Jobs growth is running at a faster rate than in either Britain or the US, with more than 3m net new jobs since the creation of the euro. The unemployment rate has fallen by a percentage point in a year. And inflation is at 2.3% despite an oil shockette and a surge in the dollar. Moreover, the euro area is still in current account surplus so that growth looks more sustainable and balanced than it does in the US. It is hard to imagine any other institutional arrangement than the single currency that would have delivered such an outcome. </p> <p><b>Christopher Huhne MEP </b></p> <p> \u0095 So, the prime minister identifies a \"democracy deficit\" in the European Union (Blair calls for Euro 'superpower', October 7). And he intends to deal with it by cajoling Britain into joining the single currency, where interest rates throughout Europe are set by a committee of three (non-elected) people. </p> <p>He is also fervently in favour of globalisation and the power of the multinational corporations - billions of pounds of trade controlled by a handful of directors. He stands by while the European agenda is formed by the European round table of industrialists - just 45 business people - heavily influencing the EU agenda. </p> <p>The European Union could perform a valuable role in grappling with the twin problems of the environment being destroyed, and the powerful multinational corporations out of all democratic control. Tony has missed yet another opportunity to put these issues on the agenda. </p> <p><b>Dr Caroline Lucas MEP</b></p> <p> \u0095 Blair wants an EU dominated even more by the nation states. It is certainly true that a strong council, grouping the member states,is essential. But it is already the most powerful link in the chain. What it lacks is not power but discipline, as when Italy and Greece broke ranks over sanctions against Serbia to buy into its state-owned telecoms company. The European commission is essential to deliver such discipline. Blair's vision is likely to deliver less, not more, accountability. The council, and national civil servants who service it, are the most secretive of the EU bodies. Only last month they reached an agreement on more competition in local telephony, but refused to release the text. </p> <p><b> Sarah Ludford MEP</b></p>",
  "<p>Henry Blodget, the Wall Street analyst who made his name and fortune by predicting great things for the internet, is in philosophical mood. \"If you step back, it's been an extraordinary period,\" he said this week. \"What we are seeing now is a return to a more normal environment.\" </p> <p>\"More normal\" means that companies which were trading at more than 100 times revenues are now down almost 100% from their market peak. </p> <p>Where once analysts talked about the new economy forever changing the way we make money, they now doubt that even the most successful internet businesses will make a profit at all. </p> <p>Last year Wall Street analysts were cheerleaders for the new contenders. Now Mr Blodget at Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley's Mary Meeker are being asked what has happened. </p> <p>Mr Blodget became famous for predicting that shares in Amazon.com would double at the end of 1998. With the shares trading at less than $30, his forecast of $400 a share now seems somewhat less than prescient. </p> <p>The damage has not been limited to Wall Street. Technology stocks in Europe have taken a beating, too. </p> <p>\"The discipline of the capital markets is exerting itself. Some companies can make it, some can't,\" said Miles Saltiel, technology analyst at London's West LB. </p> <p>\"It is not just an internet phenomenon. We are seeing the transition from a technology story that was being driven by the mobile [phone] to one that is looking to find a new major theme.\" </p> <p>The lack of a clear theme means stocks are being sold \"indiscriminately,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Blodget, although caught out like many on Wall Street, maintains a positive outlook on the sector in general. \"I still think the internet is a profound communication medium that will continue to change the global economy in ways we can't imagine now. But some people want to believe that it's going to change the business cycle permanently, which is silly.\" </p> <p>He points out that when he warned of the sector being risky, \"nobody wanted to hear about risk amid the euphoria\". </p> <p>But they are listening now. Since September 1, the Nasdaq composite index has fallen more than 20%. Even if the April shake-out of net stocks had not happened, it would represent a nasty bear market. Buying on the dips, the mantra of bull market investors, has left lots of investors under water and still drowning. </p> <p>The present fall in stocks is more worrying for many than the spring downturn because it has been led by some hi-tech blue chip names. </p> <p>Intel, a member of the Dow Jones industrial average of corporate stalwarts, almost halved in value in a day after warning that its third quarter revenues would be below expectations last month. </p> <p>This warning was promptly followed by similar signs of distress from a variety of household names: Microsoft, Dell and Apple all warned of disappointments before those on the leading edge of the new economy such as Priceline followed suit last week. </p> <p>Dick McCabe, chief market analyst at Merrill Lynch, believes that the market still has further to go as investors continue to lose faith in the new economy. \"Investors believed that technology companies were defensive growth stock, not sensitive to the economy. </p> <p>\"But they aren't like food or drugs, they are tied to the economic cycle.\" </p> <p>Even Abby Joseph Cohen, the veteran bull at investment bank Goldman Sachs, warned that investor optimism might not improve until towards the end of the year in a note published last week. </p> <p>Until it does improve the impact of investor fear and panic is being felt across the board. Smaller companies are finding it difficult to raise money as risk-averse investors demand higher yields from the junk bonds they are issuing. </p> <p>At the same time the Wall Street banks are still trying to get through an enormous queue of new share offerings such as flotations. </p> <p>One exhausted salesman, whose planned holiday in the Caribbean next month has already had to be cancelled, said: \"They're trying to get these deals out before the window closes - but it feels like the window has already been shut.\"</p> <p><strong>Marimba in a fix with the web's nuts and bolts</strong></p> <p><strong> Company</strong> Marimba </p> <p><strong> The visionary</strong> Kim Polese, once described as the \"Madonna of Silicon Valley\", was one of the four members of the team that developed Sun's ground-breaking Java code in 1996. </p> <p><strong> The vision thing</strong> Marimba provides software for businesses to deliver and update applications anywhere in the world from a central location. The product appeared to fit this year's attraction for the nuts and bolts of the web.

Marimba shares fell more than 50% last week to just above $5.

Mr Walker has seen his net wealth shrink by about $1bn in three weeks. </p> <p><strong> On the edge? </strong> Could be. Its shares fell 33% last week after Priceline was forced to close two associate companies - Priceline WebHouse Club and Perfect Yardsale - after they failed to attract enough cash.</p>",
  "<p>English National Opera's Italian season is breaking new ground for directors as well as audiences. With a single basic set invented by the season's \"master designer\" Stefanos Lazaridis, all 10 productions will share the same environment, though each will have its own visual stamp. But for David Fielding, whose production of Rossini's The Turk in Italy opens at the Coliseum tonight, the experience will be even more novel: this will be his first major opera production on a set that he has not also designed. </p> <p>For Fielding began his career as a designer, and a hugely successful one at that. He studied theatre design at the Central School of Art - it was his teenage passion for classical music and opera that impelled him, he says - and after working at Nottingham Playhouse designed The Magic Flute for Scottish Opera. He went on to be responsible for some of the most striking Coliseum sets of the 1980s and 1990s, including the Xerxes, directed by Nicholas Hytner, that effectively kick-started the Handel revival in this country, and the two searing Verdi productions by David Alden, Simon Boccanegra and A Masked Ball. </p> <p>It was as a result of those shows that he and Alden were asked to work on the Pet Shop Boys' world tour in 1991, and Fielding went on to work on a series of videos with the band as well. But directing also appealed. \"I feel that my job as a designer is done when the model is produced and after that the mechanical side is a real drudge; as the years go by it wears you down. I love working out the puzzle of a piece, and part of resolving the puzzle is working with the performers, seeing it through, and if you are only designing you do feel excluded from that process.\" </p> <p>When he began to direct, it was far less common in Britain for designers to branch out in that way than it was on the Continent. But since Fielding and Tom Cairns took the plunge in British opera, others have followed. Anthony Macdonald is directing shows now, and so is Nigel Lowery, and Fielding thinks that there is less resistance from managements to the idea of designers taking charge, and even for them to work in other people's designs. \"I've been trying to delegate this process and collaborate for some time,\" he says. \"But with the less well-financed organisations like Garsington [where Fielding has been directing a Strauss series, with Intermezzo to come next summer] they feel they are getting a good deal by getting me to do both.\" </p> <p>His work now straddles opera and theatre; he has just staged Back to Methusalah for the Other Place in Stratford, part of a short season for which he designed the whole environment (rather like the ENO's project), and directed the final play, the Shaw, himself, There are major design projects to come too - a Ring cycle for Tokyo to be directed by Keith Warner, and a musical, The 5,000 Fingers of Dr T, based on a Dr Seuss film . It will open next year in Dallas. </p> <p>Fielding was recruited to the Italian season at quite a late stage in the project's development when many of the major decisions about the series had been taken. He admits that the experience has not been totally without \"inner conflicts\". </p> <p>Inheriting the environment that Lazaridis had invented was a challenge: \"I was very aware as I watched what Stefan had done with all the different shows that we needed to do something unlike what had gone before. I hope we are presenting another take on the idea.\" </p> <p>He is full of admiration for Rossini's score: \"Unlike The Barber of Seville, which has a steely, cold quality about it, this has warmth; it is very human and allows you to laugh with the characters.\" But the problem with The Turk in Italy, he thinks, is that the plot is so complicated; his idea was to develop the storyline and to apply a new structure to it. That has involved rewriting a certain amount of the text, which is being sung in Kit Hesketh-Harvey's translation. Nonetheless Fielding finds the libretto intriguing, likening it to an early version of Pirandello, with a central character, a poet in the original, who invents the scenes that are acted out around him. </p> <p>In Fielding's staging the poet is transformed into a film director, with the Italian New Wave cinema of the 1960s, and Fellini's masterpiece 8 1/2 in particular, as the starting point. The production uses film as a medium for expressing the inconsistencies of time and space that are endemic to the opera. Rossini needs that kind of thoughtful advocacy; with the obvious exceptions of The Barber and Cinderella, too few of his operas have won a place in the central repertory, and the Italian season would have been much poorer without one representative of that huge, and important body of work.</p> <p>The Turk in Italy is at the London Coliseum, WC2 (020-7632 8300), from tonight till November 18.</p>",

  "There is, they are fond of saying here, no problem so abstruse that it cannot be solved by rational consideration and the marvels of French administration. But what with his ducks, his herons, his foxes and his fishes, the foreign minister has learned otherwise. <p>The telling tale of Hubert V\u00e9drine's pond began last year, when the doyen of French diplomats decided it would be a nice idea to refill the dried-out lake at the bottom of the landscaped gardens adjoining his official residence, La Celle-St-Cloud, outside Paris. </p> <p>Several months later, the lake was restored to its former glory. First problem: the crystal-clear waters were invaded by a particularly potent algae. </p> <p>Opting for an environment-friendly solution, the V\u00e9drines imported several dozen algae-eating carp, at considerable expense. Second problem: the carp attracted a predatory heron, who began munching his way through them. </p> <p>Third problem: the heron is a protected species in France. So displaying once more the impeccable Cartesian logic that got him where he is today, the foreign minister saw to it that a pair of foxes took up residence. To scare off the heron, bien s\u00fbr, not to eat it. </p> <p>Sadly, the foxes struck up quite an amicable relationship with the bird. Thereby posing problem number four: instead of addressing the heron, the beasts addressed the colony of mallards that had moved in. </p> <p>The foxes' fate seemed sealed. But just as Mr V\u00e9drine was about to order their destruction this spring, they produced a pair of cubs, utterly winning over Ms V\u00e9drine. </p> <p>Drawing on decades of experience in shuttle diplomacy, the foreign minister then shipped the depleted colony of ducks to the pond outside his office on the Quai d'Orsay. Whereupon arose problem number five: the mallards set about messing up a statue of one of his illustrious predecessors. </p> <p>Well that one's simple, Mr V\u00e9drine thought. He had the statue moved to La Celle-St-Cloud. There it joined the heron, but not the foxes, which had moved on to pastures new, nor, unfortunately, the carp. </p> <p>So what had happened to the carp? </p> <p>Ah well, they had fallen prey to problem number six: the lake had drained dry.</p>"
