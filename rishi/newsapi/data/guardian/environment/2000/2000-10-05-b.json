  "<p>As much as \u00a38bn of consumers' money is spent or invested on \"ethical\" products or services, according to research to be published next week by the Co-op Bank. But that is just a fraction of what the market could be if people's latent concerns about issues such as child labour, the environment and animal welfare were tapped. </p> <p>At the moment most shoppers leave their consciences at home. Only about one in seven consumers said these issues would make them choose one product rather than another, even at the same price and quality. That helps to explain why most ethical products have relatively small market shares - typically around 1%. </p> <p>Research for the Co-op, conducted by Mori, found that only 11% of people strongly believe that their shopping choices can make a significant difference on the issues they care about. And three in five said they did not have enough information on company behaviour to make an informed choice. </p> <p>The Co-op Bank's report identifies a range of products and services matching the concerns many people have with what lies behind the brands on the shelves. </p> <p>The most typical products, such as organic food or ethical investments, are just breaking through the 1% market share level. In general the most successful prod ucts have been those where the buying decision is easiest to make. For example, unleaded petrol quickly built sales because tax incentives made it cheaper than four-star. </p> <p>While most products show significant growth, there have been failures, such as green detergents. Brands such as Ecover led the brief green consumer boom of the late 1980s. Sales faded as consumers found the supposedly environmentally friendly formulations did not wash as well as their usual products. Ecover now occupies a tiny niche market. </p> <p>A third of consumers told Mori they are seriously concerned with ethical issues when shopping and a quarter have investigated a company's social responsibility at least once. Two-thirds of consumers have looked for at least one ethical label. </p> <p>The question for suppliers is who buys these products, and why other people do not. The Co-op Bank report, which investigated whether people put their money where their mouths were, provides some of the answers and paints a picture of the ethical market. </p> <p><strong> Active consumers</strong><br> </p> <p> Mori found that \"active consumers\" crossed socio-political boundaries. Party political affiliations do not define them, nor does social class, age or sex. In general, the most active consumers are the most middle-class and middle-aged. </p> <p>The research identified five groups of consumers according to their concerns and how they act on them. </p> <p>Four of these groups, representing 80% of shoppers, demonstrate in action as well as words that they have ethical concerns, although the largest group, representing half the population, does little about those concerns when shopping. They are unlikely to buy or avoid products because of a company's reputation for responsibility but they do look for recycled products and, to a lesser extent, GM-free items. </p> <p>Roughly a fifth of the population is so preoccupied with value for money that they are not likely to take much notice of how the product arrived on the shelf. These people are typically younger and from the lower social classes. The group has the highest proportion of council tenants and includes the highest percentage unemployed. They predominantly support Labour but a fifth said they would not vote. </p> <p>A third segment (18% of the population) consists of more active ethical consumers, while there is a pocket of extremists (5%) who are the most promising target group for anyone with morals as part of their marketing mix. Hardly any of them go shopping without looking for some ethical label, with two-thirds regularly buying or boycotting on ethical grounds. </p> <p>Finally, a group of brand-aware youngsters (6%) could become the ethical vanguard of tomorrow. The research suggests that many people in the less activist consumer categories could be bigger buyers of ethical products if they believed they could make a difference. </p> <p>The bank's report suggests the potential is as much as 30% of consumer spending. That should be a warning to consumer products companies which have not taken these issues seriously. </p> <p>\u0095 Who are the ethical consumers, by Roger Cowe and Simon Williams (Co-operative Bank)</p>",
  "<p>Shares in 365 Corporation, the firm best known for its irreverent football websites but that is determined to position itself as a \"digital media and communications company\", received a much needed kick yesterday, closing up 4p at 63.5p. </p> <p>Driving the rally was news of three telecoms acquisitions in cash and shares with a total value of \u00a34.62m and combined annual revenues of almost \u00a33m. </p> <p>The deals form part of an effort by 365 to consolidate telecoms hardware firms focused on small businesses in London and the south east. The plan is to buy up small hardware suppliers and use their customer bases to cross-sell 365's other services such as internet access. </p> <p>Dealers are warming to the strategy, particularly with a growing awareness that 365 appears seriously undervalued. Its market capitalisation is \u00a3127m, following a slump in its shares from March's high of 300p. </p> <p>As telecoms firm trade at an average of 18 times last year's sales, the implied valuation of 365's business division alone is \u00a3138m. </p> <p>Then there is the consumer division. At its full year results in June, 365 reported that its internet services had 2.1m users. </p> <p>Teamtalk, a rival in this arena, trades at around 18 times sales. On that basis 365's consumer division, which had sales of \u00a314.7m, should be valued at around \u00a3275m on its own. </p> <p>Insiders say growth at both divisions since the year's end has been strong, and with \u00a340m in the bank there are no fundraising worries. </p> <p>Management appears to be increasingly frustrated by the share performance. Executives have already said they may spin off the business division to realise value if the price does not pick up. </p> <p>The content of 365, which ranges from music to sport to gardening, could also prove attractive to a more established media player seeking to boost its online presence.

  "Earlier this year, I went to inner city housing estates in London and the north of England <p> I saw there how too many of their schools are failing, there aren't enough jobs available, the shops have gone, and the sprawling tower blocks are rabbit warrens for crime. It's the same story in many of our cities.</p> <p> The people who live on these council estates have never looked to the Conservative Party for support, but I believe passionately that we still have a duty to help them.</p> <p> We are going to reclaim their streets from the drug dealers and car thieves.</p> <p> We are going to bulldoze the worst of the concrete tower blocks and ensure that there are new low rise homes where the criminals won't be welcome.</p> <p> And by bringing life back to our inner cities, we will ease the relentless pressure of the developers on our countryside.</p> <p> Only the most out of touch, metropolitan elite could regard the attack on our rural life and the desperate plight of our farmers as a source of amusement. Yet, in speech after speech, and joke after joke in Brighton last week, New Labour poked fun at the anger and hardship of the people of the countryside.</p> <p> This Government thinks it is attacking only a small rural minority. In fact it is attacking the values of tolerance and respect, the values of the mainstream majority.</p> <p> Rural people look to the Conservative Party to represent them and stand up for their way of life - and we will not let them down. </p> <p> For we are ready to govern for all parts of the country - and by country I mean the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. </p> <p> But a Conservative Government will only be able to do all of these things, and govern for all the people, if we still have a country left to govern at all.</p> <p> For this Labour Government is taking us down the road to a European superstate.</p> <p> Britain is uniquely placed to take advantage of the opportunities of the twenty-first century. </p> <p> We have a unique relationship with the United States, a unique relationship with Europe and a unique relationship with the Commonwealth. </p> <p> Our language is the global language of the new economy.</p> <p> It seems to me to be blindingly obvious and basic common sense that with so many opportunities opening before us, we should not hesitate to make the most of being British. </p> <p> And the advantages of independence seem to have been blindingly obvious to the Danes too. </p> <p> The result of the Danish referendum last week has once and for all demolished Labour's bogus arguments and scare tactics. </p> <p> In a Europe where so many decisions are taken by bureaucratic elites, we should be celebrating the fact that at least in one country the people have spoken. </p> <p> It now gives us a renewed opportunity to press the case for a different kind of Europe.</p> <p> Now we must champion the cause of a flexible, free trading, low tax, lightly regulated Europe. A Europe that goes with the grain of the new global economy, in which nations combine in different combinations for different purposes to different extents.</p> <p> We will be the champions of that flexible Europe. And we will be the champions of Britain's right to govern itself. For we believe in being in Europe not run by Europe.</p> <p> So we will write into the law of our land the powers and rights that we hold today and which we will pass to the next generation, so that no stroke of a pen from Brussels, or retrospective court judgement, can take those rights away.</p> <p> And we will champion the common sense instincts of young people who know that the idea of creating artificial, centralised supra-national superstates is an idea left behind in the twentieth century as they plan their lives in the twenty-first.</p> <p> They too believe passionately that we should be making the most of being British. So I say to them, whatever else you might have thought about the Conservative Party and what we've done for Britain, it is only by coming with us that you can make sure that there will still be a Britain.</p> <p> Making the most of being British means that if taxes are lower in Britain than elsewhere in Europe we should be making them lower still to ensure that we keep our competitive advantages.</p> <p> Making the most of being British means that if our regulations are lighter than in Europe they should be lighter still for British businesses.</p> <p> And making the most of being British means that if other countries give up their currencies and take on the job of applying one set of rules to every economy across Europe, we should say: good luck, we wish them well, but we will keep our Pound.</p> <p> At the coming election, we will be the only Party committed to keeping the Pound, just as we will be the only Party committed to common sense on the countryside and on our inner cities, on crime, on education, on pensions, on health and on tax.</p> <p> As we approach this election, conscious of our responsibility to provide a new government, clear in our principles for which only we can stand, resolved in our purpose to serve the people of our country, we know who we are and what we promise to be.</p> <p> I don't promise the earth.</p> <p> I don't think we'll solve every problem.</p> <p> I don't think we'll avoid every mistake.</p> <p> I won't try to start new fads or fashions.</p> <p> I won't claim to be creating a new era.</p> <p> I just want to govern with the common sense instincts of the people of this country.</p> <p> I just want to govern with the common sense instincts of a proud people who believe in Britain.</p> <p> In place of squandered opportunity and high taxation, the determination to seize the opportunity of a new economy.</p> <p> In place of dogmatic interference and Whitehall knows best, the certain belief in the freedom of people to make their own choices about their schools and hospitals.</p> <p> In place of political correctness and the noise of the pressure group, the quiet trust in the tolerance and mutual respect of the British people.</p> <p> In place of fear on our streets and the menace of drugs, the absolute conviction that the war against crime can be won.</p> <p> In place of the cringeing surrender of our rights as a country, the confident assertion of our right to be a nation.</p> <p> I just want to govern with the common sense instincts of a people that believes in Britain and its values and institutions.</p> <p> I just want to bring to a people so deeply disillusioned by its Government,</p> <p> A Party that understands their concerns.</p> <p> A Party that shares their values.</p> <p> A Government that believes in our country.</p> <p> A Conservative Government, ready to govern for all the people.</p>",
  "<p>There was a point in today's game when England looked distinctly uneasy. While Bangladesh belted the boundaries and slogged the sixes with all the expertise of international old-hands, England fielded like the bunch of novices they resembled when Duncan Fletcher first came to power. Catches - five of them - were dropped, overthrows and wides served up on a plate, and the misfields came thick and fast. Surely England couldn't lose to Bangladesh. Could they?</p> <p>The fretting lasted as long as it took Hasibal Hussain to complete the first over of England's reply. He conceded six no-balls, a wide and two boundaries, and although Marcus Trescothick fell early, England never looked back.</p> <p>There was, however, still one big question to be answered. The form of Nasser Hussain cast the only shadow over England's heart-warming summer, and at first he batted with all the timing and confidence of a man who had totalled just 92 runs in the six Tests he played this summer. But, with a chance to play himself back into the form that he left in South Africa, this was a crucial knock. The biggest plus that England will take from this game is that, by the end, Nasser was getting there.</p> <p>It was often unconvincing, even ugly, but by the time Hussain realised that the best way of scoring off the spinner was to blast them down the ground for six rather than sweep indiscriminately for the odd single, he was playing with the cavalier confidence of old. It could be the turning-point that he's been going around in circles trying to find.</p> <p>At the other end Alec Stewart continued an overdue run of form in the one-day game. He added 87* to scores of 74*, 101, 100* and 97 (that's 459 runs at 229.50) he hit against West Indies and Zimbabwe and would have got another century but for Hick's flurry at the end. He will need to fire again if England are to get any further in this competition.</p> <p>England's fielders will need to get jiggy with it themselves. Lump together John Crawley's pace, Phil Tufnell's outfielding and Devon Malcolm's catching and you get an idea of just how bad they were. Jonty Rhodes must be licking his lips.</p> <p>The bowling, led by Darren Gough and Mark Ealham, was better, but England will be handicapped if Ashley Giles fails to recover from his injury in time for South Africa: his replacement Mark Alleyne was pure cannon fodder. And just because the wicket, which will be used throughout the competition will get slower, it doesn't mean that Alleyne will suddenly get more accurate.</p> <p>There may be more questions to resolve before England take the field again on Tuesday. </p> <p><em>Lawrence Booth is assistant editor of wisden.com.</em></p>",
  "Tory leader William Hague today used his conference speech to outline the key policies his party will fight the next election on. They include: <br> \u0095 Three pence off fuel duties and a restoration of the married couple's tax allowance. <br> \u0095 Giving education money - at a rate of \u00a3540 per pupil - direct to schools instead of education authorities and bringing in tougher discipline rules. <br> \u0095 Matching Labour \"penny for penny\" on health and getting rid of Labour's \"dogmatic\" opposition to private health care. <br> \u0095 Increasing police numbers and stepping up \"the war against drugs\". <br>\u0095 Attempting to rejuvenate inner cities by bulldozing the worst tower blocks. <br>\u0095 Championing the flexible Europe and a commitment at the next election to keep the pound. <br> \u0095 Increasing pensions by up to \u00a310 a week paid for by scrapping special allowances. <br> \u0095 Supporting the rural way of life. <br> \u0095 Reducing the number of ministers, cutting the size of the House of Commons and a halving of the number of special advisers. <br>\u0095 Halting the \"march of political correctness\" in government, local councils and schools. <br> <p>Mr Hague said a Tory government would care about and address the problems of the inner cities. </p> <p>\"The people who live on these council estates have never looked to the Conservative Party for support, but I believe passionately that we still have a duty to help them. </p> <p>\"We are going to reclaim their streets from the drug dealers and car thieves. </p> <p>\"We are going to bulldoze the worst of the concrete tower blocks and ensure that there are new low rise homes where the criminals won't be welcome.\" </p> <p>On the countryside, Mr Hague told the conference: \"Only the most out-of-touch, metropolitan elite could regard the attack on our rural life and the desperate plight of our farmers as a source of amusement. </p> <p>\"Yet, in speech after speech and joke after joke in Brighton last week, New Labour poked fun at the anger and hardship of the people of the countryside. </p> <p>\"This Government thinks it is attacking only a small rural minority.

We're going to make sure every penny is spent on clinical priorities.\" </p> <p>Mr Hague went on to repeat his declaration that young workers could opt out of the state pension and make their own arrangements, adding: \"The British people know these things can be done and we're going to do them. </p> <p>\"For we're ready to govern for all the people. We're going to govern for all the law-abiding people of this country who have sometimes felt there wasn't a politician left prepared to champion their common sense values and instincts.\" </p> <p>He added: \"It's time we halted the march of political correctness.\" </p> <p>Mr Hague told representatives he was ready to order a crackdown on crime, with the end of early prison release schemes for rapists and burglars and muggers and the controversial plan outlined by shadow home secretary Ann Widdecombe on Wednesday for stepping up the war against drugs.</p>",

  "<p><strong> Names</strong><br> </p> <p> The British don't have Christian names as such, but identify each other by an elaborate range of nicknames, possibly derived from rhyming slang or Saxon folklore. British children will answer to Begbie, Spud, Sick Boy (Trainspotting), Spike (Notting Hill), Lomper and Horse (The Full Monty), Soap, Bacon, Dog and Plank (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels) and their regional variants. </p> <p>As in ancient times, many British men are named for ease of identification with their trade, such as Tinker, an Irish labourer (The Crying Game), William Thacker, a bookshop owner in Notting Hill, or Mr Bean, a man whose escapades evoke the British love of toilet humour, engendered by the laxative effect of baked beans. (See sense of humour, below.) </p> <p>At the lower end of the social scale, nostalgia for the second world war still resonates, with chocks-away names such as Bunty (Chicken Run) and Daffy (The Beach) enjoying a resurgence, while at the higher end of the scale, anyone who isn't the Duke of Norfolk or the Earl of Sussex is called Charles or Rufus, or if they live in Scotland, Angus or \"Mac\". There aren't many women in Britain, but the few there are derive their names from US movie history (Scarlett, Four Weddings) or are called Victoria and Elizabeth and are the Queen of England. </p> <p><strong> The economy</strong><br> </p> <p> The engine of the British economy is driven by cannabis farming (Saving Grace; Lock, Stock), a booming cottage industry that fluctuates in accordance with the laws of plunder and gang in-fighting. Northern cities such as Sheffield used to be great centres of industry, but had to close when the demand for cutlery on the southern wedding circuit used up all their materials. There is a bitter divide between the prosperous south, where owners of money-losing bookshops maintain houses in London's most expensive districts, and the north, where levels of deprivation are such that repressed former steel workers have to strip to earn a crust and striking miners burn pianos for firewood. Ireland is mostly under water (Angela's Ashes). </p> <p><strong> Class system</strong><br> </p> <p> Britain operates on a more or less feudal system. Slave labour (allegorically addressed in Chicken Run) is a reality for the serfs who live north of the Wash and subsist on a diet of boiled eggs and amphetamines. Cultural deprivation has turned them wild: they underline their points by upsetting teacups and sob after their annual glass of wine at Christmas. Exposure to the Royal Ballet renders them infantile. </p> <p>Leisure activities in Britain are deeply divided by class. Children in the north of England start drinking cider at the age of 11, and their fathers box or pursue the popular working-class pastime of loitering (Billy Elliot; The Full Monty; Brassed Off). They are cold, but they've got rhythm. Middle-class men in the north of England collect garden gnomes, and those from the south attend the screening of foreign language films and learn sign language to better communicate with the deaf (Four Weddings). </p> <p>In Scotland, the Darwinian principle of survival of the fittest is a daily reality, where drug addicts compete with Scottish nationalists on the streets of Glasgow and the highlands are populated by red-haired giants known as \"clansmen\", harbouring ancient hatreds and nursing glory in their hearts (Rob Roy). </p> <p><strong> Job opportunities</strong> </p> <p> Nobody in Britain works, except for a few caterers on the London party circuit and some Irish terrorists posing as builders. Instead, men of working age picket their employers for reasons unknown - possibly for a better dress allowance - and attend job clubs, converted classrooms in which they are tempted out of the iron age by being taught how to operate a word processor (The Full Monty). However, their permanent state of outrage renders most northern men unemployable. When their wives (or more probably, ex-wives) are prised out of the kitchen, it is only to work in an environment where they are permitted to smoke, such as a municipal hall, the fields, or behind the bar in a working men's club. </p> <p>The social commitments of the metropolitan elite make full-time work out of the question, although they play at the fringes of the more genteel trades, such as antiquarian book selling, the voluntary sector and the business of opening a restaurant. </p> <p><strong> Transport</strong> </p> <p> The National Express coach net work is the only way of travelling up and down the country, although it's a journey that few undertake, given the shock awaiting them on arrival. Men entering London from the north for the first time are disoriented by its lack of coalmines and the suspicion that all southern men are repressed homosexuals. Southern men taking the coach north close their eyes until they reach Scotland, when they are whisked away from the terminus to their highland estates (Four Weddings; Elizabeth; Mrs Brown). </p> <p>Londoners get around in four-wheel drive vehicles or hail a taxi, or if they are on urgent business, steal a van. There are buses in London, but they are decorative rather than functional and cater largely for the tourist market. In Scotland people make do with walking or, more commonly, running, with the law in pursuit. </p> <p><strong> Communication</strong> </p> <p> A Briton from the south who trips over a paving stone might exclaim \"oops-a-daisy\" (Notting Hill), whereas a northerner might say \"fook\". (Billy Elliot). A northerner defending himself against a verbal attack might plead \"keep your blob on\", which is patois for \"remain calm\". Other key words in the northerner's vocabulary are, \"twat\", \"wanker\", and \"chuffed\", and most northerners communicate by using combinations of these three basic terms. </p> <p>The Scottish speak a pidgin language that requires subtitles in more evolved parts of the English-speaking world. For example, \"fling yir fuckin jaykit oan well\" means \"hang your coat up\", and \"ye ken she's really intae ye\" stands for \"you know she finds you attractive\". \"Ya plukey-faced wee hing oot\" has no known English equivalent. </p> <p>In London, men affectionately greet each other as \"bruvver\", as in \"nice one, bruvver\", or \"geezer\", as in \"all right, geezer?\", or confine themselves to the universal greeting of the east end, \"safe\", which means, \"hello\" (Lock, Stock). </p> <p><strong> Dress</strong> </p> <p> The British are unjustly targeted as poor dressers, when in fact they adhere to a strict set of tribal dress codes. Donkey jackets are the uniform of the northern man, where the recession has hit the manufacture of any colour brighter than grey, and northern women wear gold hoops through their ears and tracksuit bottoms that have lost their elastic. In the south, it is customary for men to wear suits, with an optional cummerbund around the waist, and for women to wear wide hats and ethnic jewellery, or to dye their hair burnt orange in protest against the burden of privilege under which they live (Four Weddings). </p> <p><strong> Sex</strong> </p> <p> Sex in Britain, if it exists at all, is a quick and unfulfilling affair. British men prefer the company of other British men and are predominantly asexual (Mr Bean), unless they are pursuing the age-old highland sport of rape and pillage. Since most British women are either recently deceased, of retirement age, or members of the royal family, sex is off the agenda. They tend to regard men as feeble under-performers who don't live up to their fathers (A Fish Called Wanda) or as brutes liable to pawn their jewellery as soon as they hit the pathologist's slab (Billy Elliot). A British man called upon to court a woman will go through a series of extraordinary contortions, culminating in a slapstick attempt to embrace her and ending in total humiliation, probably in his socks and underpants (Notting Hill). When it comes to sex, most British men would rather sit on a park bench reading Captain Corelli's Mandolin or marry their labradors. </p> <p><strong> Sense of humour</strong> </p> <p> Since the British laugh at their own shortcomings, they are in a perpetual state of amusement. They are particularly aroused by stories turning on the triumph of the underdog, such as a boy from a northern housing estate getting into the Royal Ballet school, hens escaping from a slaughterhouse, or a humble bookseller from Notting Hill wooing a Hollywood movie star with hilarious consequences. </p> <p>When the underdog spills things, walks into doors and is caught picking his nose by the object of his affection, the average Briton will be diverted for hours. Anyone who speaks in an accent three or more counties removed from his listener is guaranteed a delirious audience. </p> <p><strong>Big over there</strong></p> <p>1 Notting Hill (1999) $116.1m </p> <p>2 Chicken Run (2000) $106m </p> <p>3 The Crying Game (1992) $62.5m </p> <p>4 Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994) $52.7m </p> <p>5 The Full Monty (1997) $45.9m </p> <p>6 Bean (1997) $45.3m </p> <p>7 The Beach (2000) $39.8m </p> <p>8 The Lawnmower Man (1992) $32.1m </p> <p>9 Rob Roy (1995) $31.6m </p> <p>10 Elizabeth (1998) $30m</p>",
  "<p>JK Rowling, author of the Harry Potter books, yesterday donated \u00a3500,000 to the cause of one-parent families and launched a fierce attack on the widespread assumption that most single mothers are \"feckless teenagers trying to get council flats\". </p> <p> Ms Rowling, 34, has been a lone parent since her marriage broke up seven years ago. She began her literary career while drawing benefit, writing in Edinburgh cafes as her daughter Jessica slept beside her. Last year she was Britain's highest-paid woman, earning \u00a320.5m from her novels. </p> <p> In her first appearance as \"ambassador\" for the National Council for One Parent Families, she described \"feelings of worthlessness during interviews with the Child Support Agency and the Benefit Office\" as she tried to escape the benefits trap and train as a teacher. </p> <p> \"I had a degree, a profession and friends who were willing to lend me money when I badly needed it. So if I met obstacles pulling myself out of the benefit system, how much more difficult must it be for people who don't have the same advantages?\" she said.</p> <p> Ms Rowling's \u00a3500,000 donation will almost double the council's charitable income this year. She is to lead a fundraising drive to find a further \u00a3500,000 from other sources to give on-line advice to lone parents on a website, launched yesterday. </p> <p> The author said her daughter was a source of pride, joy and motivation. \"I don't want her to grow up in a society where children just like her are trapped in poverty because they have had the misfortune to see their parents split up. </p> <p> \"It is convenient to look right over these children's heads at the parent left raising them and place blame, rather than seeing the reality: somebody striving, in the face of great odds, to give their children every opportunity they can.\" </p> <p> Only 3% of Britain's 1.7m lone parents were teenagers, while 60% had been married and separated, divorced or bereaved. </p> <p> \"Seven years after becoming a lone parent, I feel qualified to look anyone in the eye and say that people bringing up children single-handedly deserve, not condemnation, but congratulation,\" she said. </p> <p> The author said she was pleased with the help for lone parents under the government's New Deal. \"But there are still about a million children living in poverty so obviously a great deal more needs to be done.\" </p> <p> Kate Green, the council's director, said a quarter of British families were headed by a lone parent. \"Most didn't choose to be alone and are doing their best in a tough situation.\" </p> <p> Lone parents had overtaken pensioners as the poorest group, with more than three in five living in poverty.

  "<p>For the past 20 years at least, urban policy in Britain has followed a familiar, cyclical theme. Spurred by conscience or political necessity, governments produce a string of initiatives - from big and expensive inner-city and riverside regeneration schemes to smaller community-based programmes - only to discover that they sometimes overlap, duplicating (and wasting) resources on a vast scale. </p> <p>The cry then goes out for \"joined-up government\", with a minister at the centre to coordinate activities and ensure that the Whitehall machine is suitably streamlined to meet the urban challenge. </p> <p>Cynics might say that William Hague's brief foray into urban affairs at this week's Conservative conference - an uncosted pledge to tear down tower blocks, create regeneration companies to reclaim derelict sites, build schools and put \"cops in shops\" to tackle crime in poorer areas - was nothing if not predictable. </p> <p>With a pledge to create an urban minister, presumably to coordinate the whole programme, it struck a familiar note; Labour even claimed that parts of the Hague initiative, a long report called Believing in Our Cities, could be taken from this government's programme for that elusive urban renaissance. </p> <p>Labour has created three regeneration companies in Liverpool, Sheffield and east Manchester - while more will be promised in an urban white paper next month. Alongside Gordon Brown's pre-budget statement, it will signal that some key recommendations from an urban task force for tax incentives to speed that renaissance have been taken on board. </p> <p>Indeed building stronger communities, and bringing the disadvantaged back into the mainstream, is at the core of New Labour's social policy. That's why it launched the social exclusion unit in the Cabinet Office, which this year published a draft national strategy for neighbourhood renewal - soon to be firmed up - which produced recommendations from improving local economies, to raising school standards and cracking down on crime. </p> <p>With a new deal for communities programme now extended to 39 neighbourhoods (invariably run-down council estates with the potential for improvement) and a string of other programmes - employment, health, education action zones, and a variety of schemes from Whitehall's single regeneration budget - this government is not short of initiatives. But exactly how all these schemes coordinate is a mystery to many. Earlier this year the performance and innovation unit in the Cabinet Office - the mini- department which arbitrates between Whitehall's competing empires - said: \"There are too many government initiatives, causing confusion; not enough coordination; and too much time spent negotiating the system, rather than delivering.\" </p> <p>The answer was to launch a regional coordination unit in John Prescott's Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, with a new politician in charge of it - the Cabinet Office minister, Lord Falconer, who has been largely preoccupied with attempting to sort out the fiasco at the Millennium Dome. Where this all leaves urban and social policy - for the two are inextricably linked - is unclear. But after the talking, and the reports, ministers insist they are at the point of delivering, with regeneration spending alone due to rise from \u00a34.5 bn this financial year to \u00a36.4 bn in 2002/3. </p> <p>Gordon Brown is preparing a series of tax incentives to turn the tide against greenfield building and revive run-down inner cities. Developers could be offered special allowances to clean up derelict land and renovate an estimated 1.3m buildings, such as warehouses, which are lying empty. The regeneration package being finalised is the government's answer to recommendations last year by the urban task force, led by the architect Lord Rogers of Riverside. Significantly, the chancellor recently met Lord Rogers to outline his plans after the architect, frustrated by ministerial delays in responding to his urban report, called for the government to move \"faster and further\" towards his vision of an urban renaissance. He called for \"significant extra resources\" for British cities, which he regards as the worst in the western world. </p> <p>The key to an urban revival is curbing greenfield building by persuading - or gently forcing - developers to concentrate on cities rather than concreting over the countryside. Already the balance is tilting with the rebirth of urban living. But more incentives are needed: Prescott's department is still pressing the Treasury to slap VAT on new houses - currently zero-rated - to further encourage urban regeneration. At present building conversions attract the full 17.5%; Prescott is arguing for an across the board rate, perhaps 5%, embracing new homes and old buildings. </p> <p>Rogers has emphasised that tough political choices cannot be avoided if new life is to be breathed into cities, which also happen to be at the centre of Labour's old, disaffected heartlands. </p> <p>As William Hague made clear this week, they could also be a battleground as the next election approaches. Tories might be thin on the urban ground - they run one metropolitan council, Bradford - but the Tory leader knows that the great conurbations, particularly the West Midlands and West Yorkshire, have proved fertile country for his party in the past. </p> <p>Peter Hetherington is the Guardian's regional affairs correspondent </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:peter.hetherington@theguardian.com\">peter.hetherington@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "Imperial nationalism is bad because it is imperial, not because it is nationalist. It is worth recalling that most empires have been constructed on behalf of dynasties, religions, or secular ideologies such as Marxism-Leninism. Cultural nationalism, as a rule, is too inward-looking to serve as the basis of an imperial ideology. Nazi Germany is often held up as an example of the evils of nationalism, but Hitler's ideology was a kind of racist transnationalism, which held that all true \"Aryans\" were kin, whether they shared a common language and culture or not. Anyway, imperial nationalisms are greatly outnumbered by anti-imperial nationalisms, for the simple reason that small ethnic nations have enough trouble holding their own without trying to conquer their regions, much less the world. The purpose of most nationalists is nothing more sinister than trying to preserve the identity of a relatively small ethnic and linguistic community by achieving and maintaining independence as a sovereign political community. <p>This is why it is so absurd to blame the world wars of the 20th century on the nationalist movements in the Balkans. Nationalism in the decaying Habsburg empire was the trigger of the first world war, not the cause. The cause of the first world war was Germany's ambition to become the dominant world power by becoming the dominant European power - an ambition which threatened the interests of Russia, France, Britain, and the US - empires all.</p> <p>Instead of blaming nationalism for 20th-century wars which were really caused by imperial rivalries, we should give some credit to the stubborn and defiant particularism of anti-fascist and anti-communist nationalists in Europe and Asia for defeating the transnational tyrannies of National Socialism and communism. Nationalists from France to Poland to Greece battled heroically to stop their countries from being melted down into Hitler's New Order; and nationalists from central Asia to the Baltic republics brought down the Soviet empire when the Soviet elite no longer had the nerve to hold it together by terror. Some of those anti-Nazi and anti-Soviet nationalists were democrats; some were not. But even the partisans and the dissidents who did have democratic values did not want democracy in the abstract. They wanted democracy for their people - the Danes, the Ukrainians, the Lithuanians, the Poles. Thanks in part to their battles for \"narrow\" and \"ethnocentric\" national self-determination, the world was saved from domination by supra-national totalitarianism. Johann Gottfried von Herder wrote in 1791: \"How wonderfully has Nature separated nations, not only by woods and mountains, seas and deserts, rivers and climates, but most particularly by languages, inclinations and characters, [so] that the work of subjugating despotism might be rendered more difficult...\" </p> <p>Critics of nationalism often assume that national sentiment is somehow incompatible with democracy. In fact, the relationship tends to be the other way around. Almost all stable democracies are nation-states, while multinational states tend to be dictatorships. The reason is simple. In a mono-ethnic society, ethnic power is not an issue; whichever party wins in Sweden will be made up of Swedes. That means that there can be political coalitions based on various other aspects of identity - class, or religion, or political ideology. But in a multi-ethnic society, political parties usually coalesce around the main ethnic groups. Each ethnic group is afraid that the others will seize control of the machinery of government. In Belgium, the Flemings worry that the Walloons will be too powerful; in Canada, the Anglo-Canadians and Quebecois eye one another with distrust. At worst, as in Yugoslavia and Lebanon, the competition between ethnic parties escalates into war. </p> <p>Only Tito's dictatorship held the Yugoslav federation together. The Soviet Union broke up along national lines the moment that a degree of democracy was permitted. There are very few stable multi-ethnic democracies. The ones that do exist - such as Switzerland - tend to be based on intricate constitutional arrangements such as elaborate systems of federalism and equally elaborate systems of power-sharing. Political philosophers and Op-Ed columnists can have fun devising intricate power-sharing schemes for a multi-ethnic Bosnia or a multi-ethnic Kosovo. But realistic policymakers have to face the fact that power-sharing systems seldom work. </p> <p>Where a state like Yugoslavia has crumbled because its constituent ethnic nations do not want to live together, it is folly for outsiders to try to force them together in a shotgun marriage - or rather a shotgun remarriage. In such circumstances, it is in the interest of all concerned that the outside powers act as divorce counsellors, seeing to it that the divorce takes place with as little bloodshed as possible. The wisest course may be to turn temporary division into permanent partition, and to recognise formally the existence of new nation-states. The results will not always be fair: some individuals will not be able to return to their homes; some groups will find themselves minorities trapped behind new borders. But in diplomacy as in the rest of life, the perfect is the enemy of the good. The rough justice of partition may be acceptable if it prevents endless warfare or endless peacekeeping. </p> <p>The Balkans is not the only place where there may never be lasting peace or prosperity until borders are redrawn, at least roughly, along national lines. In sub-Saharan Africa, most of the states are artificial creations of British and French colonial administrators. The map of African governments cuts across the map of African ethnic nations. There is no Nigerian or South African nation, any more than there was a Yugoslav or Soviet nation. One reason why so many African states are dictatorships is that force is required to prevent these artificial contraptions from breaking down in civil war among the rival ethnic nations, like the Hutu and Tutsi in Rwanda and Burundi. (Incidentally, one of the unfortunate residues of western racism and imperialism is the tendency to describe the nations of western Europe as nations, the nations of eastern Europe as ethnic groups, and the nations of Africa as tribes.) Any attempt to make political borders correspond with ethnic nations in Africa, as in the Balkans, would be messy and imperfect. But the alternative - preserving the political relics of European colonialism forever at the cost of endless authoritarianism and internecine conflict and the poverty which comes in their wake - is much worse than redrawing a border here and a border there.</p> <p>Needless to say, most of the several thousand ethnic groups in the world are too small to have states of their own - although the example of the Slovenes proves that statehood is possible for very tiny nations. The Sorbs and Wends of Germany will never have their own nation-states, any more than the German-speaking Amish in the US will have theirs. But the fact that every tiny ethnic group does not qualify for statehood does not discredit the desire for independence of substantial ethnic nations like the Kurds.</p> <p>At what point would there be too many countries? Between 1945 and today, the number of UN member states increased from 51 to 188. The addition of a dozen or two dozen more nation-states would not create chaos. At any given time, there are only a few great military and economic powers, and it is on their relations among themselves, not the number of small states, that international order depends.</p> <p>Most nation-states are relatively small, but this need not be a handicap. A small nation-state can take advantage of commercial economies of scale by joining the global market or a trading bloc like the EU or Asean; and it can take advantage of military economies of scale by joining a military alliance like Nato. Because of its political sovereignty, a nation-state, even a small, weak, nation-state, can negotiate the nature of its relations with its trading partners and its military allies. This is something no ethnic minority in a multinational state can ever do.</p> <p>In this connection, it is useful to distinguish internationalism from transnationalism. Internationalism presupposes the existence of distinct nations which interact with one another on a voluntary basis. Transnationalism posits the disappearance of nation-states and their replacement by something else - sub-national tribes, supra-national blocs.</p> <p>While the supposed trend toward transnationalism is a mirage, the growth of internationalism is real. It is more a consequence of the end of the cold war and the division of the countries of the world into rival camps than of the internet or trade treaties. There is no contradiction between the multiplication of nation-states and increasing international integration. Slovenia escaped from its involuntary membership in Yugoslavia, and immediately applied for admission to Nato and the EU. It is an abuse of language to say that when a country joins a military alliance or a trading bloc it is \"surrendering its sovereignty.\" On the contrary, it is exercising its sovereignty, so long as it retains the option to quit the alliance or trading bloc if it so chooses.</p> <p>The globalisation of commerce is an example of internationalism, not transnationalism. A Norwegian may order a product from Thailand over the internet. But he is still a Norwegian; the Norwegian government can tax and conscript him, the Thai government cannot; and it is the Norwegian government, not the Thai government, which provides for his health care and his state pension out of taxes levied on his fellow Norwegians. Globalisation is reshaping nations - but it is not replacing them.</p> <p>All of this raises an interesting question. If the nation-state is alive and well, and if nationalism is by no means the evil that it is made out to be, then why is there so much loathing of nationalism and propaganda in favour of various kinds of supra-national systems of world order? One reason is obvious: most of the states in Africa, and the middle east, and much of Asia, are non-national entities whose borders are threatened by nationalist movements. The UN should really be called the United Regimes, inasmuch as many of the members of the general assembly are multinational states held together by repression. For obvious reasons, many of these governments would prefer that self-determination be sacrificed to the sanctity of inherited borders, no matter how absurd and anachronistic the borders are. But this doesn't explain the intense hostility to nationalism in the western media, and all of the addled talk about the nation-state withering away. </p> <p>Every segment of the political spectrum in the west - left, centre and right - has its own fantasy version of cosmopolis. The socialist left, for almost two centuries, has hoped, in the face of all evidence, that international class loyalties will eventually prevail over inter-class national loyalties. Libertarians hope to reduce countries to nothing more than postcodes in the free global market. The influence of Protestant millenarianism and evangelism can be seen on British liberal internationalism and American Wilsonian liberalism. There is even a kind of conservative internationalism - although it is that of reactionary traditionalists such as John Lukacs, nostalgic for a pre-national, aristocratic European Christendom, rather than of the populists and nationalists who dominate the right in most western countries. (Given that most of literate, civilised humanity lived for most of history under non-national empires - some, like China and Rome, of long duration and lasting cultural importance - it is surprising that there is not more of this kind of conservative nostalgia for imperial civilisations.)</p> <p>Whether the chattering classes like it or not, a century from now there will be more nation-states in the world, and fewer multinational states. Nation-states like Japan and Russia and China and the US and Germany and India and Brazil, in some form, will still be here. But many if not most of today's multinational states will have vanished from the map. The UK may give way to a federation of the nation-states of England, Scotland, Ireland and Wales. Australia and New Zealand will be sovereign republics. Canada is unlikely to survive the 21st century; the only question is whether the English-speaking provinces join the US or stragggle along on their own, when the federation dissolves. Indonesia and Malaysia may be replaced on the map by a number of new, smaller countries. Not all of the nationalism of the century ahead will be disintegrative. A Greater Albania and a Kurdistan might be cobbled together. The inevitable overthrow of the remaining monarchies in the middle east may produce the amalgamation of portions of the Arab world, a region where the present borders were drawn up generations ago by the colonial bureaucrats of Britain and France. Not every nation will obtain its state: China is unlikely to free Tibet; and India is unlikely to consent to a Sikh nation-state. Whether Africa progresses or continues to decay depends in large part on whether the international community permits genuine nation-states to be formed from the wreckage of the post-colonial regimes. In some cases, such as the break-up of the UK, these changes might occur without bloodshed; in other cases they may be accompanied by immense suffering, and may even trigger conflicts among rival great powers. </p> <p>A case can be made that, on the whole, the good which has come with replacing multinational dynastic empires and dictatorships with nation-states which at least have a chance to become stable liberal democracies, has outweighed the bad which often accompanies the break-up of non-national states. In any event, the future seems clear. The 19th century was a century of nationalism. The 20th century was also a century of nationalism. In all likelihood, the 21st century will be a century of nationalism as well. </p> <p>Michael Lind is senior fellow at the New America Foundation in Washington DC and writes fiction, non-fiction and poetry. </p> <p>\u00a9 Prospect 2000</p>",

  "Al Gore and George W Bush headed straight back to middle America yesterday, the day after a televised debate that underlined big political differences between the two candidates, and which saw Mr Gore consolidate his position as the favourite to win the US presidency next month. <p>Mr Bush spent the day campaigning in Pennsylvania, while Mr Gore travelled to Ohio, both key battleground states. </p> <p>Early polls yesterday showed the Democratic vice-president making inroads among undecided voters in the aftermath of the head-to-head meeting, which drew an estimated audience of more than 60m viewers. </p> <p>A poll of debate-watchers for CBS News showed that 56% thought Mr Gore performed better than his rival, compared with 42% for Mr Bush.

He reeled off a bewildering list of figures on his and Mr Bush's tax plans, health-spending proposals and pension plans. </p> <p>Asked about the situation in Serbia, the vice-president talked crisply about President Slobodan Milosevic, Montenegro and opposition leader Vojislav Kostunica, words which the syllabically challenged Republican candidate carefully avoided pronouncing, probably wisely. </p> <p>Neither man made more than a passing mention of President Bill Clinton, but Mr Bush repeatedly tried to present himself as an outsider, presenting his lack of Washington experience as an asset, not a liability. </p> <p>\"You've had your chance, and nothing has been done,\" Mr Bush told his opponent. </p> <p>Before the debate began, Mr Gore's press spokesman Chris Lehane promised a contest between \"two competing visions, one for the many, the other for the few\". It was a characterisation that Mr Gore repeatedly asserted throughout the longest single section of the debate, a back-and-forth on the candidates' tax and spending plans. </p> <p>\"He would spend more money on tax cuts for the wealthiest 1% than all of the new spending that he proposes for education, healthcare, prescription drugs and national defence combined,\" Mr Gore charged. </p> <p>In an echo of a key issue from the past two presidential elections, the two candidates revealed sharp disagreements about abortion, with Mr Gore supporting women's rights to choice and Mr Bush defending \"life for the unborn\". </p> <p>With the next president perhaps having the opportunity to fill as many as four vacancies on the nine-member US supreme court during the coming years, the issue of abortion was \"on the ballot in this election\", Mr Gore claimed. </p> <p>Personal attacks were kept to a minimum until the last few minutes. As the debate drew to a close however, the moderator, Jim Lehrer, asked each man to say something about his opponent's character, drawing some critical personal comments from Mr Bush. </p> <p>\"I believe they've moved that sign 'The Buck Stops Here' from the oval office desk to 'The Buck Stops Here' on the Lincoln bedroom, and that's not good for the country,\" Mr Bush said. </p> <p>\"You may want to focus on scandals.

During 1998 and 1999, I spent 13 months doing Y2K remedial work, as did many others at the company. Our software is heavily date-dependent. If we hadn't done this work, our software would not have been able to function on January 1 2000 (and would have barely functioned from January 1 1999, because of the need to calculate annual renewal dates). </p> <p>The job involved checking thousands of programs containing an average of 5,000 lines of code each. Each data item and procedure had to be checked to see if it contained or influenced dates. Every change carried with it the possibility of an introduced error. Everything then had to be tested thoroughly. This had to be done while normal development of the systems was continuing. This story was repeated all over the world. That is where those \"billions\" went: companies spending large sums of money on a task that added no value to the systems except to keep them going. </p> <p>By the way, the story about Italy only spending a few million pounds is not true. That figure represented the government's spend on Y2K awareness. Their spend on remedial work was comparable to Britain's. It is a tribute to the hard work of software professionals that large-scale disruption was avoided. However, when I see comments like those of the questioner, I begin to wish there had been a few disasters. </p> <p> T J Mason, Halifax, W Yorks. </p> <p> <b> On a map of the Bering Strait, at the tip of Alaska's Seward Peninsula, are the names Wales and Cape of Prince of Wales. Why are they there?</b> </p> <p> \u0095 Cape Prince of Wales, the western extremity of Alaska, was named by Captain Cook on his third and final voyage in search of the North West Passage in 1778-79. As he had to invent many thousands of names for newly discovered features, it is not surprising that some of them lack originality, and he probably had few opportunities to ask the local people what names they had for geographical features as he was sailing past but not landing.

But he will search in vain for evidence to support his allegation of US government involvement. I was a Ministry of Transport civil servant involved in advising ministers on the route. The heaviest lobbying came from the racehorse trainers and members of the House of Lords - who seemed to form the majority of the population of the \"royal\" county of Berkshire - but there was not a word from Dr Strangelove. </p> <p>The Welford depot was served by the truncated remains of the Lambourn railway branch line. This closed to passengers in 1960 but the Newbury-Welford section remained open specifically to serve the base, and this continued after the adjacent section of the M4 was opened in 1971. I understand the decline of British rail freight in the mid-1970s led to the US forces' wish to shift the traffic to road, leading to the building of the slip road and closure of the railway.

  "<p>Electricity companies will face hefty fines for failing to meet environmental targets under proposals to be outlined today by the industry secretary, Stephen Byers. </p> <p>He will delight the green lobby by ruling out waste incineration from his definition of \"renewables\" and by putting the emphasis on new forms of energy such as wind power. </p> <p>An early consultation document suggested a \"buyout\" fee of 2p per kilowatt-hour for those who failed to buy 5% of their supplies from renewable sources by 2003 and 10% by 2010. Well-placed sources say Mr Byers has privately accepted the need to charge a \"buyout\" fee of 3p per kilowatt hour, which will anger the electricity companies but please the renewable industry. </p> <p>\"We anticipate this will kickstart our sector, lead to over \u00a35bn worth of capital investment and create thousands of jobs,\" said one executive from a renewable energy company. </p> <p>Big companies such as National Wind Power, a division of Innogy (formerly National Power) and PowerGen Renewables will be among the beneficiaries. </p> <p>Stephen Tindale, chief policy adviser to Greenpeace UK, said dropping incineration would put the government \"back on the right trajectory after a series of disappointments\". But the green lobby admits that further financial help might be needed and say electricity companies will pass on some of their extra costs to consumers. </p> <p>The Department of Environment has had a target of 10% of electricity from renewables by 2010 for more than two years as part of the government's manifesto pledge to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 20% by the same date.

  "Plants grown in contaminated soil near the Chernobyl nuclear power station in Ukraine have mutated at a much faster rate than expected. <p>Researchers from Switzerland, Britain and Ukraine warn in an article in the latest edition of the journal Nature that their experiments show that the effects of radiation on plants are not well understood and may be more severe than was previously thought. </p> <p>The scientific team, led by Olga Kovalchuk from the Friedrich Miescher Institute in Basel, planted identical crops of wheat in two locations - one on a highly radioactive plot close to Chernobyl, the other in uncontaminated but otherwise similar soil 19 miles away. They then grew further crops from the seeds of each set of wheat. </p> <p>Even though the plants close to the nuclear power station were exposed to radiation for only 10 months, the genes of the crop raised from this seed showed a sixfold increase in the mutation rate compared with the normal wheat. </p> <p>What alarmed the scientists was that the wheat growing in the radioactive area was exposed to relatively low doses of radiation. </p> <p>\"This low-level exposure should not cause such a large increase in the mutation rate, suggesting that chronic exposure to ionising radiation has effects that are as yet unknown,\" they wrote in Nature. </p> <p>The scientists do not believe the mutations could have been caused directly by a weak blast of radiation hitting the plants' DNA. </p> <p>They suspect that some so far unidentified mechanism is affecting genes by upsetting the delicate mechanism of the plant cells as a whole. </p> <p>The findings have troubling implications for future generations of plants, animals and humans living in and around the Chernobyl contamination zone, created in 1986 when one of the four reactors on the site exploded. </p> <p>So far the only undisputed medical effect of the disaster has been a big rise in the number of cases of child and adolescent thyroid cancer in the regions of Ukraine, Belarus and Russia adjacent to Chernobyl. </p> <p>But scientists fear that the worst consequences of Chernobyl will only emerge in future generations. </p> <p>The disaster has had mixed consequences for the environment around the power station. In the short term the area, evacuated of human beings, has become a haven for wildlife. The danger now is from clumps of radioactive particles which were blown across Ukraine and Belarus by the wind and fell to earth. </p> <p>But the of radioactive mutations - the generation of hideous monsters and giant insects - is unlikely to occur, since even with radiation speeding up changes in DNA, it would still take many generations for evolution to pick out useful new genes which would enable new species to emerge and survive.</p>",
  "A damaging split has developed inside the shadow cabinet between supporters of William Hague and Michael Portillo over the handling of what should have been the Tories top vote winning policy - to cut fuel duty by 3p a litre. <p>The row which has echoes of the disputes, which have bedevilled Labour between the Brownites and the Blairites, exploded at an shadow cabinet \"awayday\" at a hotel near Ayles- bury at the end of last month. </p> <p>Both Hague and Portillo supporters confirm that there was \"a row\" between Mr Portillo and at least four members of the shadow cabinet over his failure until the next day to produce a plan to cut fuel duty while the nation had nearly been brought to a halt by protesters. </p> <p>During one exchange Archie Norman, the shadow environment secretary, is said to have told him: \"You are leaving us fighting in the trenches without giving us any guns.\" </p> <p>Mr Hague's supporters are furious that the leader did not act earlier to take over the handling of the policy, and see this as the first sign that Michael Portillo is seeking to carve out his own agenda. </p> <p>According to them, Mr Hague and almost half the shadow cabinet wanted to announce a pledge to cut petrol duty in early September, well before the protest began. They say the cut, which would have been higher at 5p per litre, was vetoed by Mr Portillo. </p> <p>When the shadow cabinet next met on September 20, after the fuel protest and evidence that the Labour poll lead was collapsing, Mr Portillo came under fire from at least four shadow cabinet ministers - Archie Norman, Andrew Lansley, Bernard Jenkin, and Liam Fox. </p> <p>They accused him of dragging his feet. Mr Portillo is said to have announced a u-turn, promising a 3p cut a litre in line with the Tories' opposition to the last rate rise in the Budget. </p> <p>But according to shadow cabinet sources Mr Portillo decided he would announce it himself - and made it clear to William Hague that he did not want any leaking of the figure in advance when journalists were briefed the next day. </p> <p>According to sources he also refused to allow two of the strongest critics who were furious about this, Mr Jenkin, the transport spokesman, and Mr Norman, to take part in the press conference announcing the price cut. Instead he insisted on doing it alone after a short introduction from the leader. </p> <p>One source said: \"It shows Michael's poor judgment and William Hague is letting him get away with it. </p> <p>If we had proceeded with the original plan the Tories could not have been accused on jumping on any populist bandwagon - we would have had protesters saying that they wanted at least what the Tories were already demanding.\" </p> <p>One of Mr Portillo's critics, Mr Lansley, tried to publicly redress the balance by pointing out at a conference fringe meeting that the Tories had been committed to reversing Labour's 3p tax rise since the Budget. </p> <p>Some senior Tories are also critical of Mr Portillo holding a \u00a310,000 consultancy with an US oil and chemical giant, Kerr McGee, which has extensive North Sea oil interests, while holding the shadow chancellor's job. One senior backbencher pointed out that he could not have announced the tax cut in parliament, as holding that job breached the advocacy rules. Mr Portillo has been under fire from Labour who argue he should quit the consultancy or stand down from the shadow chancellorship. </p> <p>One shadow cabinet minister, who is a strong Portillo admirer, defended him. \"There may have been a row about this at the shadow cabinet but at that same meeting nearly half of them were still proposing to do nothing about it and Michael did act.\"</p>",
  "<p>Thomas Paine, the 18th century political theorist, criticised Edmund Burke on the grounds that the latter's Reflections on the Revolution in France \"pities the plumage, but forgets the dying bird\". </p> <p>Today, amid the upheavals of the global automotive industry, Britain's components makers could be forgiven for adopting Paine's reproach. While problems affecting vehicle manufacturers (Ford and the Fiesta, BMW's and Rover, Nissan's ruminations over where to produce the next Micra) attract a high profile, the troubles of the components makers get less attention. </p> <p>But troubles there are, as the Engineering Employers' Federation noted yesterday. There is a certain amount of lobbying for tax breaks ahead of the chancellor's pre-Budget report in the EEF's ruminations about a dearth of investment. That is inevitable. It should not however be allowed to detract from the EEF's very real message about what is happening on the ground. </p> <p>As car makers seek to cut costs to hang on to what is left of their domestic market share, one group being squeezed is the components suppliers. They are an obvious target. Components account for around 70% of the cost of making a car. There is increasing anecdotal evidence that car makers are using euroland prices as the benchmark - leaving the components industry to switch production where it can to the single currency zone or watch business drain away. Vauxhall's new Vectra (not due to come into production until 2002) will have up to 25% less UK components than the present model. </p> <p>The timing of the industry's travails is doubly unfortunate. It is not only a question of present loss. The global components business is consolidating as firms look for bigger orders for components that can be fitted to more than one model. Britain's current disadvantage could easily become permanent. </p> <p><strong> Euro gap </strong><br> </p> <p>Though the balance of opinion is probably against it, there is a chance the European Central Bank will raise interest rates today. Justification for the decision, if it comes, might well be couched in anti-inflationary terms. But the real reason will relate to last month's heavyweight intervention on the foreign exchanges last month to help the euro. Classical theory has it that, for the impact of intervention to have any chance of being sustained, it must be followed by an appropriate policy response addressing the problems that caused the currency to lose favour in the first place. </p> <p>The question is whether raising euroland interest rates represents the appropriate response. Hardly. Raising rates would close the interest rate gap between the eurozone and the US. But, given the signs - including yesterday's poor French consumer confidence figures that growth in the single currency area may be peaking - it would hardly close the gap in economic performance. Indeed it may well be that, as with the 1985 Plaza agreement, the US has insisted that euroland take measures to boost growth as part of the price for American support. </p> <p>The worry is that the ECB will be unable to accept that doing nothing is an appropriate policy response and will move for the sake of being seen to be doing something. </p> <p><strong> Not that Easy </strong><br> </p> <p> A business which generates 80% of its sales through the internet is coming to the stockmarket - nothing new there then. Except this one has real assets, a staff of 1,400 and - here's the oddity - has made a profit in four out of its first five years. That EasyJet has thrived is in no small part due to the deep pockets of founder Stelios Haji-Ioannou and his ship owning family. </p> <p>But it has also rapidly embraced and profited from innovation. EasyJet was one of the first airlines to accept internet bookings. Cybersales also means less expensive recruiting. Selling tickets across Europe is a multilingual business, and finding telesales operators fluent in Flemish as well as French and German is time consuming and expensive. On the net providing customer service in any language is just a couple of clicks away. </p> <p>But EasyJet reckons the net has limitations. Online marketing, says the company, doesn't work. So it sticks to loud price offers on billboards, radio and the pages of newspapers - and just uses the net to process the sales. </p> <p>EasyJet sticks to its knitting. There are no tickets, no free food. </p> <p>They operate just one type of plane - workhorse 737s - which cuts training and servicing costs and means planes can be moved around the network as required. </p> <p>Will it fly? It should, but City investors might find one aspect of the company a tad too traditional. Professional investors can be cautious about family-controlled companies - and Mr Haji-Ioannou and his family will retain more than 60%.</p>",
  "Gordon Dixon's prospect is perfect. He can see the Opera House and the harbour bridge across the water from the office he is setting up now that the Olympics have enticed his British company, Frazer Nash, to Sydney. <p>Sydney was staggering back to work yesterday with a splitting headache from the final parties, prolonged by a bank holiday. The economic hangover widely predicted to follow the games may lift more easily, as a bumper crop of tourists and businesses are lured to Australia by the dazzling impression the city left on the Olympics' global audience. </p> <p>Frazer Nash won a contract to supply 330 electric vehicles to carry police officers, fire crews, athletes and equipment around Olympic Park. </p> <p>\"We knew that you don't get much better than the Olympics in terms of a worldwide audience to showcase your product,\" said Mr Dixon, who is the company's director of regional operations. \"Such was the response to our vehicles that we decided to establish a permanent home here in Australia.\" </p> <p>The Olympics offered minnows such as Frazer Nash the chance to mingle with corporate giants and potential clients. Wise to the event, the Australian government milked it for all it was worth, setting up a business club which held more than 100 networking events. </p> <p>When the New South Wales government bid for the Olympics in the early 1990s, its treasury withheld its support, fearing a repeat of the disastrous 1976 games, which left Montreal bankrupt. </p> <p>But the state treasurer, Michael Egan, has told taxpayers that Sydney 2000, which cost the commonwealth and state government \u00a31.2bn, has been completely paid for, and has dismissed the fear that the end of the building boom will harm the city's finances. </p> <p>Nevertheless, the government has outlined a four-year investment programme, involving new roads, railways and hi-tech business parks costing \u00a37.9bn: \u00a31.3bn more than it provided in the four years leading up to the games. It is intended to provide 130,000 jobs, compensating for the 50,000 lost with the end of the Olympics. </p> <p>To capitalise on Sydney's exposure, the Australian Tourist Commission has launched 90 new advertising campaigns across the world, although its US advert, starring the old Australian staples Paul Hogan and a talking Koala, has underwhelmed its critics. </p> <p>The Arthur Andersen management consultancy have estimated that the Olympics will add \u00a36.3bn to the GDP of Australia in the six years either side of the games. But Mr Egan said that the most important impact of the games would be the statistically untraceable decisions of individuals sold on Sydney. </p> <p>\"The real economic advantage . . . is a very long-term one and it comes from repositioning our international investment and trading reputation in the world. The best comparison is the Tokyo Olympics in 1964, which changed the world's perception of the economy of Japan. </p> <p>\"Most people who know anything about us see us as a farm by the sea.

  "JK Rowling, author of the Harry Potter books, yesterday donated \u00a3500,000 to the cause of one-parent families and launched a fierce attack on the widespread assumption that most single mothers are \"feckless teenagers trying to get council flats\". <p>Ms Rowling, 34, has been a lone parent since her marriage broke up seven years ago. She began her literary career while drawing benefit, writing in Edinburgh cafes as her daughter Jessica slept beside her. Last year she was Britain's highest-paid woman, earning \u00a320.5m from her novels. </p> <p>In her first appearance as \"ambassador\" for the National Council for One Parent Families, she described \"feelings of worthlessness during interviews with the Child Support Agency and the Benefit Office\" as she tried to escape the benefits trap and train as a teacher. </p> <p>\"I had a degree, a profession and friends who were willing to lend me money when I badly needed it. So if I met obstacles pulling myself out of the benefit system, how much more difficult must it be for people who don't have the same advantages?\" she said. </p> <p>Ms Rowling's \u00a3500,000 donation will almost double the council's charitable income this year. She is to lead a fundraising drive to find a further \u00a3500,000 from other sources to give on-line advice to lone parents on a website, launched yesterday. </p> <p>The author said her daughter was a source of pride, joy and motivation. \"I don't want her to grow up in a society where children just like her are trapped in poverty because they have had the misfortune to see their parents split up. </p> <p>\"It is convenient to look right over these children's heads at the parent left raising them and place blame, rather than seeing the reality: somebody striving, in the face of great odds, to give their children every opportunity they can.\" </p> <p>Only 3% of Britain's 1.7m lone parents were teenagers, while 60% had been married and separated, divorced or bereaved. </p> <p>\"Seven years after becoming a lone parent, I feel qualified to look anyone in the eye and say that people bringing up children single-handedly deserve, not condemnation, but congratulation,\" she said. </p> <p>The author said she was pleased with the help for lone parents under the government's New Deal. \"But there are still about a million children living in poverty so obviously a great deal more needs to be done.\" </p> <p>Kate Green, the council's director, said a quarter of British families were headed by a lone parent. \"Most didn't choose to be alone and are doing their best in a tough situation.\" </p> <p>Lone parents had overtaken pensioners as the poorest group, with more than three in five living in poverty. Ms Green said she was disappointed that Conservative plans to give more support for mothers to stay at home were to be only for married couples. Similar help was required by lone parents whose children were often distressed and most needed the remaining parent to be at home for a while. </p> <p><b>Useful link</b></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.oneparentfamilies.org.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">National Council for One Parent Families</a></p>",
  "<p>Women are always telling me that we men are useless, and in truth when it comes to reproduction, the existence of men has long puzzled me too. </p> <p>All a man gives to the whole process of reproduction is a single sperm's nucleus carrying 3 million-millionths of a gram of DNA! This fertilises the woman's egg, adding to her DNA, and she then nurtures this large juicy fertilised egg, packed full of her goodies, into a human being in her womb. </p> <p>And then she breastfeeds the baby - often to toddler hood! If, like hermaphrodite earthworms, all human beings could devote the same energy to reproduction, we could produce twice as many offspring. </p> <p>Of course, the world is now too full of people and we do not need more efficient strategies for reproduction. But still the question remains: why has Mother Nature been so wasteful in making men? In seeking to account for the paradox of male existence, I came up with a rather novel explanation - that men help women to evolve faster. </p> <p>Evolution, as Darwin taught us, proceeds by selection upon variation. This variation is generated by genetic mutations - changes that arise in the DNA sequences of our genes. </p> <p>Desirable \"good\" mutations spread through the population, \"bad\" mutations are eventually weeded out. One way in which mutations can happen is from copying \"mistakes\" during DNA replication when chromosomes divide to produce a full set for each new cell at cell division. The more mistakes made, the more genetic variation. And with more variation to select upon the pace of evolution can accelerate. </p> <p>As a newly fertilised egg divides to produce the developing fetus, certain cells are set aside to become future sperm in baby boys, or future eggs in baby girls. A woman is born with about 4,000 eggs, a man may make anything between one to 10 million million sperm during the course of his lifetime. </p> <p>Thus it takes many more cell divisions to produce sperm than eggs. And each time a cell divides it makes mistakes in copying its DNA. Since men's sperm mutate more than women's eggs, this must generate more genetic variety in both men's sons and daughters for natural selection to act on. </p> <p>Stronger selection can also speed up the rate of evolution. This is illustrated very nicely by the strong and \"artificial\" selection we have performed in breeding the huge variety of different pedigrees of dogs from chihuahuas to St Bernards from their common ancestor the wolf. </p> <p> Selection is also stronger on men than on women. Success in passing one's genes to the next generation is much tougher for men. Women cannot increase their number of children by taking many lovers. Eggs and pregnancy are expensive. But sperm are cheap, and with many wives or mistresses, successful men may have many children, but unsuccessful men may have none. In other words, for men, much more than for women, the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, genetically speaking. </p> <p>Of course, in some cases, it is the women choosing the successful males. So promiscuous men help their sons and daughters to evolve by spraying their mutant seed all over the place. </p> <p>In the changing environment when we broke away from other apes to evolve into human beings, this helped speed up evolution. We are drawn to the conclusion that if it were not for men, women would still be monkeys climbing trees or even worse perhaps hermaphrodite worms crawling through the primeval ooze! </p> <p>This is poor solace perhaps for some women who may hold the view that \"a woman needs man like a fish needs a bicycle\". But do women still need men? </p> <p>A fish does not need a bicycle to reproduce, nor do women need men. All they need is his sperm. The sperm could be maintained in the bodies of a few splendid specimens that women could keep as studs. A single ejaculation provides 400 million or so sperm. </p> <p>Or if they wanted to do without men altogether, they could, perhaps, grow sperm in the test-tube. But they will probably always need sperm - as experiments in mice show that \"fertilising\" an egg with the nucleus of another egg (instead of a sperm) produces abnormal offspring. </p> <p>There is something magically different between the DNA in eggs and that in sperm. The developing foetus needs both. In Brave New World, Aldous Huxley proposed a world with test-tube babies where a woman's womb is replaced with an artificial one, so reducing women to mere egg donors with the biological status of men. I think we are a long way from developing that. But you don't need GMO technology to tell you that all women need is some sperm - not men.</p>",
  "<p>Think of someone you know who has never used the net, not even for email: your mother perhaps. If a government survey released this week is to be believed, the net-disenfranchised constitute 55% of adults - or almost 25 million people on the wrong side of the digital divide. </p> <p>Now put yourself in the position of the web missionary: the poor idiot who, after dinner and a bottle of wine, agrees to show your never-user around. How do you do it? </p> <p>Conscious of the power of first impressions, do you decide to show them one thing, which, to the eyes of a newcomer, will immediately release the potential, spirit and charm of the web? If so, what will it be? Email? A powerful search engine? A portal? A news service? None of the above? </p> <p>I believe there is one unmarketed, relatively unknown type of site that, executed right, will help to introduce the newcomer to the internet and keep them coming back. It is called a weblog. </p> <p>A weblog is, literally, a log of the web - a sort of frequently updated portal, where new entries go to the top and old ones drift to the bottom. It usually consists of the take of one editor - the weblogger or \"blogger\" - on the gems he or she has found online, either generally or on a theme. It sounds simple, and it is. Find one who shares your taste, and you have a surfing companion for life. </p> <p>The benefits to the new user are many. As with a conventional gateway site, you are soon offered links to other sites that cover your field of interest. But a good weblog will contain extra qualities: topicality, an individual voice, and a simple, often Spartan, design. These combine to create user-friendliness away from the glare of the big corporations - exactly what the sceptical surfer wants from the net, and doesn't get anywhere else. </p> <p>If your newcomer is into US media gossip, say, they need not go much further than <a href=\"http://www.MediaNews.org\" target=\"_new\">MediaNews.org</a>, edited by Chicago weblogger Jim Romenesko. It may be produced by a journalism institute, but it began as a labour of love. \"A weblog,\" he says, \"is certainly more intimate than a corporate site - and I think the best ones will increase that intimacy.\" </p> <p>With intimacy comes the freedom to explore a niche: <a href=\"http://www.chaparraltree.com/honeyguide/\" target=\"_new\">http://www.chaparraltree.com/honeyguide</a>. Honeyguide is a science weblog and Romenesko's other site, the <a href=\"http://www.obscurestore.com/\" target=\"_new\">Obscure Store</a>, a weblog of the weirder world of news. </p> <p>If your newcomer wanted something more general, they would find that close bond in any number of personal sites. <a href=\"http://www.haddock.org\" target=\"_new\">http://www.obscurestore.com</a>. The Haddock Directory is a weblog-cum-portal by Phil Gyford, an ex-Londoner now attending a course in \"studies of the future\" in Texas. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.kitschbitch.com/\" target=\"_new\">Kitschbitch</a>, by Katy Lindemann, a gap year student who did a stint at the Guardian, is more diary-based. And in <a href=\"http://www.rebeccablood.net/\" target=\"_new\">Rebecca's Pocket</a>, half news weblog, half liberal treatise on the world, San Francisco-based web developer Rebecca Blood chats to you as if you were in the next room. The tease \"what's in Rebecca's pocket?\" says it all. </p> <p>So why are weblogs so little known? Although they have been around since the very beginning of the net, the term was coined only in December 1997 (by Jorn Barger, editor of the <a href=\"http://www.robotwisdom.com\" target=\"_new\">Robot Wisdom weblog</a>), and there are still only tens of thousands across the world - nothing compared to the billion or so web pages in existence. Furthermore, most blogs are run by twentysomething Americans with at least an unhealthy interest in computers - a bias that is still reflected in the content of most sites. </p> <p>Only in the past year has software been developed which allows people to get blogging with the minimum of know-how: <a href=\"http://www.blogger.com \" target=\"_new\">Blogger</a>, the most celebrated of these, has just celebrated its first birthday and its 40,000th user. But although Pyra, the company that created it, is rightly praised for increasing the number of webloggers, Blogger has also spawned \"link-sluts\" - cliquey, second-generation webloggers who link to better blogs in the hope of a link in return. Despite Blogger's impressive figures, the number of quality weblogs hasn't quite reached critical mass. </p> <p>Webloggers can also be fiercely protective of their independence. Like the editors of zines before them, they exist in a world beyond the gaze of the marketing exec and the venture capitalist. \"Few webloggers are doing weblogs to attract millions of viewers,\" says Gyford, who edits Haddock. \"They don't have any marketing budget to help them do that, so they won't.\" </p> <p>Romenesko concurs, although his audience has grown quickly from just hundreds of visits a month to a quarter of a million, by little more than links and word of mouth. \"It's like fanzines - it's always going to be a semi-underground culture, and they have a limited interest,\" he says. \"Look at how much money is spent on marketing for these major sites.\" He does, though, sound a note of vindication: \"Fox News: their website, which has probably dozens of employees, they market on the Fox News channel. They don't have many more visitors than I have at my Medianews.org weblog, which has never spent a cent in promotion.\" </p> <p>Like Romenesko, most webloggers are sceptical of the way corporations exploit technology - and rightly proud of the way weblogs buck the trend. </p> <p>\"As we are increasingly bombarded with information from our computers, handhelds, in-store kiosks, and now our clothes,\" says Blood, in an apologia she has posted on Rebecca's Pocket, \"the need for reliable filters will become more pressing. We urgently need to cultivate forms of self-expression in order to counteract our self-defensive numbness and remember what it is to be human.\" </p> <p>Such filters are especially important to the newcomer; but the irony remains that it takes a corporation to reach newcomers on any scale. So, anathema as it is to many in the blogging community, why aren't more corporations doing weblogs of their own? </p> <p>A few newspapers have tried it out. <a href=\"http://www.sjmercury.com\" target=\"_new\">The San Jose Mercury News</a> runs a weblog, with high-profile IT columnist Dan Gillmor at the helm. The same newspaper produced one to catalogue the Y2K \"crisis\" in the days and hours after midnight 2000 - pity the journalist who had to cancel leave for that. Other papers with weblogs include <a href=\"http://www.startribune.com/\" target=\"_new\">The Minneapolis Star Tribune</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.theage.com.au/\" target=\"_new\">Melbourne Age</a> and, of course, the Guardian. Our blog of global journalism has been around since April. </p> <p> Also there is increased potential for niche media, such as the trade press, to create weblogs to suit their market. \"I can easily see a corporation producing a topic-oriented weblog,\" says Blood. \"In fact, I think it would be a very good way to position oneself as an expert in an area. I'm surprised more companies aren't doing this.\" </p> <p>But the value doesn't stop there. Internet service providers (ISPs) such as <a href=\"http://www.virgin.net\" target=\"_new\">Virgin Net</a> and <a href=\"http://www.Freeserve.com\" target=\"_new\">Freeserve</a> - home surfers' first view of the net - have long been putting original content on their websites, hoping customers will see them not only as a connection but as a gateway to the web. </p> <p> Many customers proceed to change their home page to a search engine or media brand they trust. But how much more trusting would newcomers become if these pages truly fulfilled the gateway function, and provided regularly updated links and commentary from the new surfer's point of view? </p> <p>The trouble, as Gyford points out, is the fear of losing 'stickiness'. \"Big corporations will want to attract millions of viewers,\" he says, \"so they'll produce very different products. People who make such decisions would have seen it as sending viewers off to other sites which is still, to them, a very bad idea.\" </p> <p>Of course, it doesn't take much nous to realise that links are what the web is all about; nor that 'stickiness' is achieved by offering users a service they trust. </p> <p>If you believe statistics published by Which? Online this summer, seven million Britons don't believe the net product is for them; and another half the population, who have used it at work, can't justify having it at home. </p> <p>Maybe it's time the ISPs, whose job it is to get people online, adopted more of the spirit of the net and said hello to the corporate weblog. </p> <p>\u0095 Chris Alden edits the Guardian Unlimited weblog <a href=\"http://guardianunlimited.co.uk/weblog\" target=\"_new\">http://guardianunlimited.co.uk/weblog </a>.</p>",

Granted, some are a little strange, like the person who wants to trade a holiday for eight in a 1998 caravan for four Steps tickets in Glasgow. Or the person who has an Ethiopian silver earwax scoop and wants big kitchen knives, a futon base, and a toaster. Yes, the site's worth looking at just for its entertainment value.

Create an investment group and compete against other groups, if you dare. </p> <p><strong> Historic clicks </strong><br> BT caused an uproar when it claimed it had a patent on the concept of hyperlinking: the basic way in which the web is constructed, allowing people to click on a live area of a website and jump to another location. BT said it had applied for a patent in 1976, and it will remain in place until 2006. But patent lawyers have been looking at a 90-minute film made by Stanford University in California in 1968 (see <a href=\"http://sloan.stanford.edu/MouseSite/1968Demo.html\" target=\"_new\">http://sloan.stanford.edu/MouseSite/1968Demo.html</a>.

Check out the details at <a href=\"http://www.codygifts.com\">www.codygifts.com</a>, but given reports in the past of the station's various fires, failures and other hair-raising incidents, most people will probably prefer to get their highs from another turn on the Millennium Wheel. </p> <p><strong> Jonze signs </strong><br> The Academy-nominated director Spike Jonze has joined the advisory board of <a href=\"http://www.atomfilms.com\">AtomFilms</a>, the popular film site that features animations and short, downloadable films.
