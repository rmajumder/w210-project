  "<p>The BBC chairman, Sir Christopher Bland, has denied that the swift move of its peak time news bulletin to 10pm was a pre-emptive strike against ITV, branding the commercial broadcaster's plan to run its Nightly News in the 10pm slot not \"news at ten\", but \"news attenuated\".</p> <p>Sir Christopher, speaking at lunchtime, denied that the decision was a knee-jerk reaction to last month's announcement that ITV would be resurrecting a 20-minute 10pm news bulletin, three nights a week, from the beginning of 2001.</p> <p>He said: \"Our job is to offer the best possible proposition to viewers. We weren't unaware that there will be a 20-minute overlap with ITV three days a week, but to think that alone should have dictated our decision is wrong. It was important to get on with it once we had made this decision and show the BBC is able to act decisively.\"</p> <p>Sir Christopher dismissed suggestions that having BBC1 and ITV news bulletins at 10pm was not in the best interests of viewers. \"We don't have two nightly bulletins at 10 o'clock,\" he said. \"Three nights a week you have one half-hour slot and one 20-minute slot - which isn't news at ten, it's news attenuated.\"</p> <p>The BBC chairman also defended the speed of the move, saying that \"the broadcasting environment is changing and the BBC needs to change. Had we waited till October next year, we would've been accused of being sluggish and complacent. We have shown we can make our minds up in the interests of public service and get on with it.\"</p> <p>Sir Christopher said that moving the news to 10pm would provide \"better coverage of parliamentary votes and the business markets and breaking stories in America - which with the US election coming will be vital to our international coverage. Serious news must have scheduling certainty\".</p>",
  "<p>What have British theatre directors ever given cinema? Quite a lot, as it happens. Most notably they've given us The Madness of King George, Trainspotting, Notting Hill and American Beauty; now, in the shape of Stephen Daldry, they've given us Billy Elliot, the latest homegrown film to achieve vertical lift-off. Daldry joins a select but significant crew of theatre professionals - Nicholas Hytner, Danny Boyle, Roger Michell and Sam Mendes among them - who have stepped outside the cosy circuit of the performing arts and taken their chances in the big bad world of the movies. </p> <p>Daldry, the 40-year-old director of London's Royal Court, has been lucky in one crucial respect: he has been groomed for a film-directing career by Working Title, the British-based production company whose product ranges from Notting Hill to O Brother, Where Art Thou? Working Title gave Daldry the prize-winning script of the short film Eight as a trial run in 1998, and Billy Elliot is the first film to be made by the company's \"independent\" arm WT2. But even Working Title were probably surprised by the staggeringly positive reception that has greeted Daldry's debut: sobbing reviews, roaring audiences, and a \u00a31.54m opening weekend box-office take - outdoing Four Weddings and a Funeral. </p> <p>Daldry remains mystified by the public reaction. \"I'm relieved,\" he says, sucking on a cigarette. \"To be frank about it, it was - is - a small budget British film that faced struggles in its making. But it was also a good working context, in that it became very special to the people working on it. It was a real surprise the way the Cannes audience responded to it; in Croatia they responded in the same way. I've just come back from three weeks touring it in the US, and it amazes me that what is essentially a small British film can have such a cross-cultural, cross-nationality reaction.\" </p> <p>Superficially at least, Daldry still appears wedded to the student-company lifestyle for which he was renowned throughout his decade-long tenure as the London theatre world's shining star. He's wearing shorts, for a start, having pedalled down from a meeting at Working Title's Oxford Street headquarters. The hair is blond and neatly trimmed, the brow clear and unfurrowed. If cinema's siren call will change this, only time will tell. </p> <p>He stresses that, in cinema terms, he's still a beginner. \"The other month I did an afternoon at the National Film School, and I felt like such a fraud. I thought: what do I know about this? For me, it's such a new medium. Most of my enthusiasm is quite childish; it reminds me exactly of what it was like working in my early 20s in theatre. I find it genuinely exciting.\" </p> <p>Daldry has yet to adjust fully to his elevation to the film-making elite. Even so, when he acted as master of ceremonies at the charity premiere of Billy Elliot last week in Leicester Square, you could sense the ease with which Daldry handles the spotlight, his confidence before a massive, if largely adoring, audience. Actually this is something Daldry has got used to. His flair for attention-grabbing first surfaced at the Gate in London, an unprepossessing fringe theatre which Daldry turned into the capital's premier works-in-translation venue. </p> <p>Upon being appointed artistic director at the Royal Court at the age of 32, Daldry became a theatre-world phenomenon. (And all this on a Sheffield University education, rather than Oxbridge.) He assured his financial security with his production of JB Priestley's An Inspector Calls - originally for the National Theatre in 1992, but ever since a fixture in the West End and on the international touring circuit. </p> <p>You get the sense he likes being a celebrity, even going so far as to be photographed with his shirt off in a Sunday magazine. He also has an appetite for public life, as evidenced by the colossal fundraising exercise he initiated to finance the renovation of the Royal Court. Intriguingly, it's this aspect of the creative personality, he feels, that film-making has brought out. </p> <p>\"It's a constant process of crisis management,\" he ruminates. \"I'm not using the term pejoratively. In terms of the organisational management of a consistent process of crisis, it's not the same as rehearsing a play. It's a lot more like a going through a redevelopment project at the Royal Court. You're in a process of constant crisis over how to deliver something at the right time for the right money.\" </p> <p>This, it would appear, is the principal factor behind theatre people's achievement in the movies: with the right script and the right support, their proven ability to organise and enthuse within what Daldry likes to call a \"collegiate\" environment can make the difference between success and failure. Working Title's John Finn, who produced both Eight and Billy Elliot, is clear on the point. \"When we made Eight, outwardly Stephen coped well, but afterwards he said it was a bit like Vietnam - he had no idea what was going on. The short was a great experience because he's got a good sense of humour, and the ability to have people pull in the same direction. </p> <p>\"Initially Stephen was frustrated by how long it takes and how many people are on a crew,\" Finn continues. \"But he picked things up so fast, and he is incredibly visual.\" Daldry has clearly found his ideal collaborators, too: Finn; screenwriter (and playwright) Lee Hall; and cinematographer Brian Tufano, the British veteran responsible for Shallow Grave, Trainspotting and East is East. </p> <p>But this doesn't explain Billy Elliot; you can have the best team on the planet and still make a lousy movie. British theatre directors are celebrated for their silver tongues, and Daldry can talk with studied elegance about why he wanted to do Hall's script: \"I liked the idea that it was a full-on emotional journey, and I suppose it was interesting to do something that wasn't doing a take on its subject matter or its characters. Emotion has gone out of fashion in lots of ways.\" But it's not until he starts to talk about the miners' strike that forms Billy Elliot's backdrop, that you realise here is something he really cares about. </p> <p>\"I think it was one of the most important moments of post-war domestic British politics. It's surprised me how there haven't been more films about it. Especially since the time of the strike was one of the most phenomenal periods of creativity ever seen in this country. Poetry, music, theatre.\" Daldry himself was part of that explosion, working on a play called Never the Same Again in a pit village with a co-operative theatre company. The irony that his film has been taken up and praised by the same social forces that orchestrated the vicious media attacks on the miners in the mid-1980s, is not lost on him. </p> <p>'There's a sense across the political board, that the loss of those industries and those communities is elegaic, that something profound was lost that might have been worth fighting for in a different way. There was a great north-south divide during the strike, and a lot of people reacted against what Margaret Thatcher called 'Mr Scargill's insurrection' - the notion that they were the enemy within. </p> <p>\"Ten years later, with that last big march in London against the final pit closures, the miners weren't allowed to use the normal route, and they went down Kensington Church Street. I was there and it was phenomenal. You're in one of the bastions of Little England - it's full of antique shops and coffee shops - and there were people cheering out of their windows and bringing out tea. Suddenly the miners are the underdogs and it's OK.\" </p> <p>But it would be unfair to characterise Daldry as a proselytiser, or even as a sentimentalist. He is, for example, nettled at the mention of showbiz politicians (\"I think it's good when people are 'wheeled out' to say what they feel about things. More people should do it\"). </p> <p>He recounts with glee a story about Billy Elliot's test screenings in the US, in mall-multiplex country. The distributors told him they'd be happy with a 40-average scorecard. The Full Monty got something in the 70s. Billy Elliot, in the end, got 86. That's something no one can argue with.</p>",
  "<p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> Four years ago Tony Blair promised us a new Britain.<br>He promised taxes wouldn't rise. But they have. <br> He promised shorter waiting lists. But they're longer.<br> He promised smaller classes. But they're larger. <br> He promised more police. But there are fewer. <br> He promised his government would be purer than pure. What a joke.<br> </p> <p> I feel so sorry for the many people who put their hopes in that man. They are so bitterly disappointed. </p> <p> They were sold a dream and it's just not there. And there hasn't been a single word of apology. </p> <p> Well, he did say the Dome hadn't been a runaway success. </p> <p> Not a runaway success? As I recall, that's what people said to me after my defeat in Enfield Southgate. </p> <p> It's four years since I could address a party conference from the platform. A lot of water has flowed under the bridge. We've travelled a long distance since then: I have, you have, the party has. </p> <p> I was devastated by my defeat at the time. It certainly didn't feel like it at the time, but the British electorate did me a favour. My period out of parliament was a chance to connect with the Britain of today. </p> <p> Now, as Shadow Chancellor, I cannot forget those experiences. My job is not just about dry economics. The quality of British life cannot be measured in material terms alone. </p> <p> We are the party that understands how much the world has changed. </p> <p> Our country would be stronger and its people more willing to take responsibility if we had fewer politicians passing fewer laws, raising fewer taxes and intruding less in our lives. </p> <p> Young people reject the Labour Party's bossiness, meddling, banning and regulating. </p> <p> Britain has changed and the Conservatives have changed with it. For new generations of British people, old prejudices have been swept away. </p> <p> The Conservative Party is a party for our times. </p> <p> We are a party for people, not against people. We are for all Britons: black Britons, British Asians, white Britons. Britain is a country of rich diversity. That Britain was on display in Sydney. Athletes of every background united by a pride in Britain, and Britain united by its pride in them. Conservatives don't look for uniformity, but for the qualities that mark people out as individual and exceptional. </p> <p> We are for people whatever their sexual orientation. The Conservative Party isn't merely a party of tolerance: it's a party willing to accord every one of our citizens respect. Why should people respect us if we withhold respect from them? </p> <p> We value people for what's inside them. </p> <p> We heard last week Labour's smears against our policy on asylum seekers. That policy will re-establish public confidence in our controls. That frees us to give a warm welcome to those who come to Britain in fear of their lives. </p> <p> That's how my father came. Britain's willingness to take in refugees defines us as a generous and responsible people. It's a tradition that will be upheld by the Conservative Party. </p> <p> We want people to aspire, to reach the heights to which their qualities can lift them. </p> <p> While I was out of parliament I took a television camera into some housing estates. I saw a lot of poverty. But in a way what shocked me was not so much the absolute poverty for many people had videos and their children wore Reebok trainers. What distressed me most was the poverty of expectation and ambition, the lack of hope for anything better in life to come. </p> <p> But in a Saturday school organised by the black community in Sandwell, I found that aspiration: parents determined that their children should have a chance to fulfil their dreams. And education would be the ladder by which they'd climb. </p> <p> Many Labour politicians climbed that ladder. But now they want to kick it away from others. For reasons of pure dogma, they destroy good schools: grant-maintained schools and grammar schools. </p> <p> But they send their own children to exclusive schools. That's Labour's real policy on education. One rule for themselves, another rule for those they govern. </p> <p> William Hague went to a state school. So did Theresa May. So did I. I had excellent teachers. We weren't intimidated by public schools like Mr Blair's. We thought we could do just as well as they did. </p> <p> No state school should ever feel second class. </p> <p> Every parent knows that a school is only as good as its head teacher. The Conservative way is to trust the head teachers and give them the money to spend as they choose. We will give them the opportunity to create great schools, to lift the sights of their pupils, and to transform their young lives. </p> <p> This is our message to parents and teachers: we will set the schools free. </p> <p> The next generation will want to be more independent in their retirement than pensioners are today. We will give them the chance to put their money into a properly-funded pension. We'll enable future generations to accrue prosperity and share fully in the growth of our economy. </p> <p> We won't fudge welfare reform. </p> <p> Gordon Brown promised pensioners change. They got it. Loose change. 75 pence. And when pensioners sent it back in disgust, Gordon cashed the cheques. </p> <p> While I was enjoying my sabbatical, I worked for a few shifts as a hospital porter. I remember once wheeling a patient to the operating theatre on a trolley. He was motionless and I was awfully afraid he might be dead. But without warning, almost like Frankenstein's monster he sat bolt upright and said, \"What on earth are you doing here Mr Portillo?\" </p> <p> I was experiencing the sharp end of the NHS. </p> <p> Everything was in short supply. There weren't enough wheel chairs. So porters had to horde them. It reminded me of stories of the war, when there was rationing, but everyone mucked in and tried to be cheerful. </p> <p> It was impressive. The doctors, nurses and porters are heroes. But things shouldn't have to be like that. </p> <p> Britain spends too little on health. </p> <p> There's a consensus amongst the parties that we should spend much more money on the NHS. But not on how to spend it, nor on how that money can be supplemented. </p> <p> Labour impose politically motivated targets on our doctors and nurses. No wonder they're demoralised. We would give doctors responsibility, and trust them to spend the money wisely, treating the sickest patients first. </p> <p> Where Labour's horizons end, ours begin. </p> <p> Our neighbours in Europe know that you cannot rely on taxes alone to finance health. They would think it silly that families in Britain are encouraged to spend money on their home, on their continued education and on their retirement, but are discouraged through dogma from spending their own money on their health. So other countries have schemes, for instance organised by trade unions and employers. We'll want to encourage that in Britain too. </p> <p> Well spend much more money on the Health Service. And attract extra money too. </p> <p> Labour are stuck in ancient ideology. As Ann Widdecombe once said, Labour have built a Berlin Wall between the public and private sectors. </p> <p> We will tear down that wall. </p> <p> Liberal Democrats have a policy for health and education too. It's is to make doctors and teachers pay more tax. It's not much of a gift for the NHS. But it's a great gift for every Conservative candidate fighting a Liberal Democrat. Let's hear a round of applause for my old pal Charles Kennedy, the Tory candidate's friend. </p> <p> While I was out of Parliament, I became a small business. The Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise sent me a pile of forms and books and tables that thick. I found it daunting and time-wasting. What a pity Gordon Brown doesn't live in the real world where business people live. </p> <p> We never forget that governments don't create prosperity. Businesses do. </p> <p> Tomorrow David Heathcoat Amory will tell you about our plans to cut red tape. We will make VAT simpler and fairer. Let's stop punishing the people who create the jobs. </p> <p> All Labour Chancellors regulate more. All Labour Chancellors tax more. But Gordon Brown is no socialist hero. He hasn't taxed the rich to give to the poor. He's cynically chosen soft targets for his stealth taxes: hard-working families, people he thought who would never protest. </p> <p> Labour think high taxes give them the moral high ground. They talk of social justice. They believe that money that government spends is always more worthwhile than money that people spend for themselves on their families. </p> <p> But I don't. </p> <p> I believe in allowing hardworking families to keep more of the money they have earned. I believe in allowing them to keep more of their dignity and responsibility. </p> <p> Recently, a man wrote to me, a member of the seamen's union. The union's told him Gordon Brown's taxed the pension fund and he must pay out another \u00a3200 a year if he's not to be worse off in his retirement. </p> <p> Is that social justice? </p> <p> Another man told me he's just retiring. Gordon Brown's abolished the married couple's allowance and age allowance. The man will have to pay \u00a3500 a year more in tax than his brother who retired last year. </p> <p> Is that social justice? </p> <p> In Suffolk last week a mother of four children, a beautician, told me she's been driven out of business by Gordon Brown. She can't afford to fill her tank with the most expensive petrol in Europe. </p> <p> Call that social justice, Mr Brown? </p> <p> There is no social justice in high taxation. </p> <p> The Prime Minister devoted a large part of his Brighton speech to smearing the Conservatives. People long ago stopped believing Mr Blair when he spins his own policies let alone when he falsifies ours. People found his speech not only unbelievable but also disillusioning. Wasn't he meant to bring a new honesty to politics? Why can't he behave like a Prime Minister? </p> <p> Before the election Labour claimed it was no longer addicted to high public spending, that the amount we spend is less important than how well we spend it. They committed themselves to stick to Conservative spending plans, because they knew that our prudence was a foundation of economic stability. </p> <p> But as the events of the last few weeks have shown, this is not a Chancellor whose word is his bond. </p> <p> Our economy has been growing since 1992. That gives us an opportunity to increase public spending. I plan to spend more on public services in every year than Labour has spent in any year. But I don't intend to spend money the country hasn't earned. I will leave room for tax cuts. </p> <p> Labour taxes more and delivers less, and plans higher taxes year after year. Conservatives will tax less, spend better and deliver more. That will be the choice at the next election. </p> <p> We will cut taxes on business, so that they can compete and create prosperity and jobs. </p> <p> We will reform Labour's taxes on entrepreneurs and on inward investment. </p> <p> We will encourage savings, to give people security and self-esteem. </p> <p> We will help pensioners and hard-working families. </p> <p> We will restore a married couple's allowance. </p> <p> We will cut the duty on fuel. </p> <p> That gives you a flavour of my budgets! </p> <p> We will keep an independent Bank of England. We will make it more independent of government and more accountable to Parliament. </p> <p> We will establish a National Accounts Commission to show the world that under the Conservatives there will be no fiddled figures. </p> <p> And we will have an independent committee of economists to give public advice to me on the proper level of surplus or deficit. </p> <p> These measures will ensure honesty, transparency and prudence. </p> <p> They will ensure stable economic policies. They will protect the value of the pound in your pocket. </p> <p> And when I say the pound I mean the pound. For our economic policy will be based on Britain having its own currency and setting its own interest rates. </p> <p> Gordon Brown wants to be the next Chancellor of the Exchequer and he can't tell you whether he wants to control his own currency or not. </p> <p> Labour like to call us little Englanders. Is it likely a little Englander would be called Portillo? I am half Spanish, and proud of it. I am a true European, someone with a love of Europe's different cultures. </p> <p> As the Spanish proverb goes: Antes de que te cases, mira lo que haces. Before you get yourself hitched, watch what you're doing. Look before you leap. </p> <p> The euro plan fails to respect Europe's differences. It shoe horns all the economies of Europe, with their different qualities and cycles and stages of development, into just one currency, and just one interest rate. </p> <p> It threatens to take Europe back to boom and bust. The Irish now have high inflation. But there's nothing they can do about it. When Ireland joined the euro it gave up the right to set its own interest rates. </p> <p> In Germany the economy seems to be faltering. For Germany the single European interest rate is too high. </p> <p> Not surprisingly, one interest rate for all of Europe is wrong for most places most of the time. </p> <p> And here's the rub. Supposing the people of Ireland want to vote against the policies that are driving up their prices? They can't do it. Their elected government doesn't make the policy. The critical political decisions about growth and jobs in Ireland are being taken by the European Central Bank. </p> <p> And who votes for the European Central Bank? No one. It's wholly unaccountable. </p> <p> The most precious thing in Europe is democracy. Mr Blair hoped to bamboozle Britain into joining the euro. He hoped to scare us like children with tales of how frightening it would be to be left out. Denmark has shown that people cannot be fooled or bullied by arrogant politicians. </p> <p> Mr Blair please take note. </p> <p> At the election we will oppose the euro. British public opinion is suspicious of the euro as an unproven piece of political dogma. That is our view. That is the view of the moderate majority. We want to keep the pound. </p> <p> And remember this. The euro is a bright idea recommended by the people who brought us the Dome! </p> <p> Labour is leading Britain in the wrong direction. Compared with the United States we are under-performing. Labour is weighing us down with regulations and taxes. It's making us uncompetitive. It'll throw away our national goal of full employment. </p> <p> Last week Tony Blair talked about Britain in his usual cool Britannia terms. In reality Labour lack confidence in Britain and seem ashamed of it. They are defeatist, thinking there's no future for us unless we are more and more absorbed into Europe, less and less able to make choices for ourselves. </p> <p> It's amazing that the government of the world's fourth largest economy should have given up the game. </p> <p> Conservatives recognise the need for Britain to be globally competitive and produce global companies. If we commit ourselves to maintain control of our own currency and taxes, to be agile and open to change, to cut regulation and make our taxes competitive with the world, we can make Britain the outstanding enterprise centre in Europe. </p> <p> We have a vision that fits our times. </p> <p> William Hague has led this party out of dark days. I have never seen anyone face difficulty with such composure. He has real courage. The courage Britain needs in its next Prime Minister. </p> <p> The quality of British life cannot be measured in material terms alone. I will not forget the experiences I had while out of parliament. </p> <p> We will be the party of tax cuts, and welfare reform. Of social justice and full employment. </p> <p> We will use the months ahead to be ready for government, to win the trust of the people that Labour has betrayed. </p> <p> We are a party that believes in Britain, a party for all our people, a party that offers them aspiration and hope. </p> <p> </p>",

  "<p>French media and utilities group Vivendi's efforts to woo the international investment community were boosted yesterday by sharply higher earnings and plans to revamp its corporate governance structures. </p> <p>Jean-Marie Messier, the chairman, said the group was looking to scrap a series of measures which limit shareholders' voting rights. </p> <p>\"I believe all the measures, taken together, make for an ambitious corporate governance package,\" Mr Messier said yesterday. </p> <p>The company has held a series of investor road shows, ahead of its planned $34bn acquisition of Seagram of Canada, at which American shareholders are understood to have voiced concerns about Vivendi's existing corporate governance practices. </p> <p>\"It [the package] shows we are listening to investors,\" Mr Messier said. </p> <p>The proposals include scrapping double voting which gave some shareholders more rights than others, linked to the length of time they had held their shares. </p> <p>They also end the board's right to issue large amounts of new shares - without consulting shareholders - in the event of a takeover bid. Mr Messier said the company planned to post voting forms on its website as soon as French law allowed for the change. </p> <p>Restrictions which link the numbers of shares of investors who hold stakes of more than 2% to the overall number of shares being voted look likely to stay for at least the time being, with Mr Messier arguing that the curb will become decreasingly important as Vivendi increases the number of shareholders taking part in annual meetings from the current 30% or so. </p> <p>Vivendi's strategy is expected to put pressure on other French companies to bring their corporate governance more closely into line with international best practice. </p> <p>Corporate France has already taken a number of steps, including unwinding cross shareholdings and, under pressure from the government, publishing the pay of top executives. </p> <p>As well as its reform of shareholder voting rights Vivendi revealed that net attributable profits rose to \u20ac1.4bn (\u00a3840m) in the first half of the year - up from \u20ac847m in the same period last time. </p> <p>The figures, which included a \u20ac380m after-tax profit on the sale of assets, were quoted on a pro-forma basis because of accounting changes at Cegetel, its telecoms business, and the effect of converting the results to an average foreign exchange rate for the period. </p> <p>The group - which in Britain takes in the rail companies Connex South East and Connex South Central and water companies including Three Valleys - said that it expected second-half performance either to match or beat that of the first half. </p> <p>First-half sales rose to \u20ac19.4bn with the main surge coming from the communications and environment business. The internet business was \u20ac72m in the red at the operating level but Vivendi said the loss was within budget. </p> <p>Debt at the end of the first half amounted to \u20ac21.7bn but that figure would have been \u20ac14.5bn if the proceeds from the recent flotation of Vivendi Environment and other asset sales since the end of the period were taken into account. </p> <p>Vivendi shares ended the day up \u20ac1.70 at \u20ac85.90 on the Paris Bourse.</p>",
  "<p>The world's top 10 oil companies, including BP and Shell, will generate nearly $111bn (\u00a375bn) cash this year on the back of booming crude prices, according to financial experts. </p> <p>This embarrassing accumulation of wealth against the backdrop of a fuel crisis could lead to calls from motoring organisations for windfall taxes to be levied on the oil groups. The lobby would seek sympathy from the government, which also feels the oil companies let it down during the crisis. The industry is expected to reduce the size of its money mountain through increased capital expenditure, higher dividends and share buybacks. </p> <p>Investors could get $82.5bn (\u00a356bn) through share buybacks from the 10 largest companies over five years to 2004, according to research by UBS Warburg. The biggest lump of this, \u00a327.8bn, would be offloaded by the world's largest oil group, ExxonMobil, with \u00a310bn by Royal Dutch Shell, and \u00a311.2bn by BP. </p> <p>These estimates, confirmed privately to the Guardian as \"realistic\" by oil company executives, are based on a conservative outlook of world oil prices. The share buybacks could be much larger if crude prices remain strong. </p> <p>UBS Warburg has based its predictions on the assumption that the key Brent blend price will drop from an average of $29 per barrel this year to $17 per barrel between 2003 and 2004. However, it is not just the price of crude that has created the \"spare\" cash. Income growth from cost savings, half of which were generated through an unprecedented level of mergers and acquisitions, have also contributed. </p> <p>The top 10 oil companies, which also include TotalFina of France and Conoco of the US, were 17 separate groups before they amalgamated under pricing pressure in 1998. </p> <p>Yesterday there were signs that corporate restructuring is continuing in this sector with Gulf Canada unveiling an \u00a3800m takeover of rival Crestar Energy. </p> <p>The top 10 oil companies are also benefiting from higher gas prices, better refining margins and improved conditions in the chemical sector where trading has been tough in recent years. </p> <p>UBS Warburg believes this year will prove to be \"as good as it gets\" for the big oil firms, who will spend more of their surplus cash in future on expanding chosen areas such as gas and power projects. </p> <p>Global crude prices could peak over the coming months when they reach $40 or even $50, but experts believe that growing production output will gradually hammer down long term prices. </p> <p>The price of Brent rose again to over $30 yesterday, amid news of renewed tensions between Iraq and Kuwait, and signs that the EU countries were putting aside plans to tap into strategic reserves. </p> <p>Kuwait has accused Iraq of stealing oil from a pipeline laid during Baghdad's occupation of the country ten years ago. Deputy prime minister Mohammed Sharar said yesterday that Kuwait had satellite pictures and field evidence to back up its claims. </p> <p>Brent crude for November delivery moved up $1 to $30.84, while US light crude futures were up 96 cents at $31.71. EU governments failed to agree to sell off strategic reserves last Friday, after Germany expressed doubts about the plan. </p> <p>A final agreement is not expected until the EU leaders' summit in Biarritz, in two weeks time. In the meantime hopes that Europe will follow the US lead and tap its reserves are fading. fading.</p>",
  "<p>The government has still to discover what the practitioners have known for years: there are actually two departments for education. The Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR) is the other. Supported by the Single Regeneration Budget matched with European Funding and the Lottery, a dense thicket of DETR-sponsored education initiatives and projects has sprouted all over the land. The result is two parallel systems, the old, or mainstream, and the new. </p> <p>The inflexibility - of funding, management and curriculum - that dogs the mainstream system has helped to spark the growth of the new. If further education colleges cannot afford to run neighbourhood centres, then the Single Regeneration Budget can. If schools cannot afford to open up their facilities for evening and holiday use, then there is Lottery funding to help. The result, as a new survey by the Learning City Network shows, is a complex set of local partnerships set up to manage facilities which cut across traditional boundaries. </p> <p>Hull is one city which has been grappling with these problems for years. In the mid-90s, it pioneered the use of the regeneration budget to fund schools and neighbourhood renewal. As a new unitary authority, it recognised the need for a partnership which could weld the old and the new systems together. The city created an urban development company, CityVision, to promote its revival, with a board representing the great and the good to run it. Sub-partnerships were given the task of managing economic development, lifelong learning, community development and the environment. A key benefit of this approach is that the main agencies have collaborated to bring about major projects, which would have been beyond their resources acting alone. Last year brought \u00a35.9m for lifelong learning in Hull, including an innovative science and technology project for schools, whilst this year there will be a further \u00a36m to promote learning in the city's most disadvantaged communities. </p> <p>Joining up initiatives, promoting collaboration, developing an overview of local needs: this is the job that Learning Cities are doing throughout the UK and Europe. The rapid growth of the Learning City Network - from five in 1995 to 45 today, including Birmingham, Liverpool, Edinburgh - reflects the need for local partnerships to make sense of the plethora of government policies and initiatives. The survey demonstrates the range of the response, from small towns like Torfaen in South Wales, to Kent Thames-side, a region in its own right. </p> <p>The real power of the idea comes from connectivity, from joining up centres so that they can share expertise and information. Glasgow's REAL Learning Network is the most ambitious project in the UK. A partnership of the City Council, Scottish Enterprise, further education further education, higher education, schools, business and community organisations are working together to create a single standard for an e-learning system designed to stimulate 300,000 new enrolments and to help small firms to adopt innovative approaches. </p> <p> \u0095 Martin Yarnit, a consultant on learning and urban regeneration, acts as policy adviser to Learning City Network.</p>",
  "<p>It has become standard practice for schools to profess opposition to prejudice. In the inner cities, posters advertise contempt for racism, sexism, maybe homophobia, too, if the headteacher is exceptionally brave. Even in the shires and small towns, where cultures may be more uniform, we find grave pledges of commitment to equal opportunities and fair play. If there is one place in children's lives where bigotry is challenged it is surely their schools. But could it be that appearances deceive? That the true impact of modern school life on the young is to narrow minds rather than expand them, to consolidate dislike into dedicated loathing? In short, is school the place where children learn to hate? </p> <p>Cedric Cullingford, professor of education at Huddersfield University, writes: \"The home is the seed-bed on which the tendency to prejudice can be grown. It is the school that sees this tendency flourish.\" For Cullingford, the fostering of prejudice, from snobbery to xenophobia, is a consequence of the very structures and priorities of school organisation - an inevitable, if undesired, product of the current learning system despite the best efforts of teachers. Add-ons to the curriculum, those once-weekly lessons in personal and social education, are bound to fail, Cullingford believes. \"The problem is that the addition of more knowledge, whatever the subject, does not address the issue of the purpose of the school.\" </p> <p>The purpose of the school? Not to educate: at least, not according to Cullingford's definition. The conviction of his new book Prejudice: From Individual Identity to Nationalism in Young People is that no child who'd received an education worthy of the word could so blithely make remarks such as these by a seven-year-old girl: \"There's quite a lot of Chinese people here. My friend, Di Wan, she's Chinese and people pick on her. They go like that [pulls at eyes] and everyone says where's Di two and three? I feel quite sorry for her. I still wouldn't like to be Chinese, though. I don't really like their eyes myself. And I don't like the way they speak.\" </p> <p>The inconsistency between individual empathy and generalised enmity is so marked as to seem absurd. Yet it may be the very stuff of future chauvinism: blanket dislike of such staggering illogic it seems impervious to argument or reason. Conventionally, enlightenment is seen as flowing from accumulated knowledge. But Cullingford's case is that in school life the opposite habitually occurs. For him the key to it is that the preoccupations of schools, the increasingly inflexible agendas that they work to, might almost have been designed to stop children finding out the things they're most eager to know and so prevent them from acquiring the most valuable intellectual tool of all - the ability to think critically. \"When children first go to school they are full of curiosity,\" Cullingford says. \"They have big questions in their minds: what is the meaning of life? Schools do not help them answer it.\" </p> <p>The book's thesis is informed by \"child-centred\" research - interviews with mostly seven- and eight-year-olds about their feelings for themselves and others. In youngsters' talk Cullingford detects their capacity for going either way: for embracing the rich diversity of life or for retreating from it in fear, with all the destructive potential that entails. </p> <p>From very early on children become repositories of unrefined information, much of it acquired from television, be it Neighbours or the news. Africa is full of thin, unclothed people, America runs with money. Germans, of course, are war-like. And the French? \"Frogs' legs and snails,\" says a seven-year-old boy. \"Some people are artists. They sometimes wear blue striped jumpers, T-shirts and a blue hat with a little, a tiny knob on it. I've seen it on television.\" </p> <p>They are keenly aware, too, of their own need for individual love and attention and the insecurities arising from a fear of its lack. Also, the children dream, especially of space - not just physical but psychological. They imagine bigger gardens, bigger homes and having bedrooms of their own where there'd be freedom from the plague of other people. \"I've got a big bedroom to myself, says one boy interviewed. \"Peace and quiet. Cos when I read, I don't like people talking.\" </p> <p>Such are the attitudes and concerns children bring to the school environment. What they need most urgently, Cullingford contends, is for these to be guided down avenues of social insight to help them qualify emotions with reason. Instead there is a clamour of closed doors. School has little time for such concerns. What is more, children know it. \"They are quite clear that school is there for teachers, not for them,\" Cullingford says, \"even if the teachers are nice. When teachers put them under pressure, children know why it is - it's because teachers are concerned about test results, league tables and so forth.\" </p> <p>School is a rigid hierarchy, which children recognise they are expected to fit into. Most do. Most adapt and conform. They stick by the rules and strive to produce what's asked for, boring and meaningless though it so often seems to them. </p> <p> Meanwhile, there is the other side of school life, the unofficial one of brittle friendships, angry conflicts, pleasurable play but also fear of bullying. The reply of \"nothing\" is so typically heard by parents reckless enough to ask their children what they did in school today that it is now celebrated in a TV commercial. Maybe that's because children's real business of the day is not the literacy hour but the unending switchback of interpersonal concerns. </p> <p>It is in this unofficial realm - far more influential than its counterpart - that children most urgently require the skills school does not teach them or, significantly, those that industry requires: communication, flexibility, a capacity to reason and objectively appraise. It is also the domain in which those pupils least able to oblige the official school agenda take dangerous refuge. It is here that a school's \"failures\" and those unable to fit in for other reasons draw comfort from the menacing solidarity of the outlaw peer group or, by contrast, the bitter consolations of isolation, as vividly expressed by this eight-year-old girl. </p> <p>Q: \"Do you like anything about yourself?\" A: \"No.\" Q: \"Nothing at all?\" A: \"No. I just don't like the other children. They pick on me. They're rude. They say naughty things.\" Q: \"If I could wave my magic wand and change something about you, what would it be?\" A: \"A horse.\" Q: \"You'd like to be a horse?\" A: \"Yeah, cos they're nice creatures. They're nice animals.\" Q: \"Do you like being you?\" A: \"No.\" </p> <p>Through such a lens of disaffection, a child's school is an oppressor and other groups of pupils are their undifferentiated foes. In their language of self-loathing, paranoia and rage do we hear the sound of greater hatreds yet to come? Is this what is meant by \"excellence for all?\" </p> <p> \u0095 Prejudice is published by Kogan Page, \u00a318.99.</p>",
  "<p>If talk of a virtual learning environment, avatars and a vertex doesn't leave you completely bewildered, chances are you are in year six of Oakthorpe Primary School in Palmers Green, north London. </p> <p>Oakthorpe is part of a research project launched with Middlesex University and called Vertex: 3D Virtual Worlds Applications in Primary Education. It has a virtual classroom in which year six are creating a virtual world. </p> <p>Confused? Maria, 11, explains: \"A virtual world is a kind of world that is different to our world, but in a way it is like our world - it's in the middle.\" </p> <p>The virtual classroom sounds more exciting than it looks. Leave the corridors lined with children's paintings and a cupboard full of sports trophies, and enter an extremely well equipped IT suite, with a brand new toy in the centre - an interactive whiteboard. </p> <p>You can write on this latest piece of equipment as a normal whiteboard or you can project the computer screen onto it, forming a huge monitor that can be written on and worked by the touch of a hand. It is like magic. Handwriting (providing it is clear and not too curly, which can confuse the computer) can be turned into type and printed. </p> <p>When children from year six were introduced to this latest wonder, says the headteacher, Geoff Cumner-Price, they quickly had it sussed. The children, he says, had no fear of technology. After only a few days their teacher and IT co-ordinator, Alan Goddard, was saying, \"Hold on, what did you just do?\" </p> <p>The vertex, which is accessed through individual monitors or the whiteboard, is a virtual world not unlike a computer game. To start with the children were looking at landscapes and objects created by other users. In this way they were introduced to the idea of an \"avatar\", an electronic representation of a person in cyberspace; soon, each child was given his or her own avatar. Almost immediately, they were finding ways to interact with their friends' avatars. </p> <p>There are two other schools involved in this project, one in Orkney, one in Soho, London. The children began communicating with the Orkney pupils through the avatars they met in the virtual world. </p> <p>The latest experiment with the avatars is putting the children's faces on them, from photographs taken on digital cameras. Once the children knew what they were doing, a new - and completely empty - world was introduced. Time for them to create landscapes of their own. </p> <p>This is a secure world, unlike some of the worlds on the web which are rather, well, grown-up. The children were responsible for building it, which increased their skills and ICT capability, and it soon became full of unusual gardens, swimming pools and mansions. They built a virtual maze, mostly communicating only through the computers, which became quite difficult when someone else was trying to move the wall that had just been specially built! </p> <p>The next phase of the project includes plans to look at ways of broadening the range of skills the children can learn in the virtual environment, to make more links with the literacy and numeracy aims of the school, and to use it as another means of publishing and developing the children's artistic and language work. </p> <p>Last word to the children. What do they think of all this? \"Wicked!\"</p>",
  "<p><strong> The Ofsted inspector</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> This former inspector has three teenage sons. He has chosen to remain anonymous.</strong> </p> <p> \"I'd start by getting the latest performance tables to see what the results looked like. This wouldn't give the full picture of how the school had done by its kids, so I'd then look at the latest Ofsted report to look at the key stage 3 results to see how the school had done in comparison with similar schools. Schools are banded according to the number of pupils on free meals; not everyone accepts this as an accurate way to compare schools, but it does at least give an indication of how well a school is doing. </p> <p>\"I would also expect to see 95% or more of pupils achieving A* to G grades at GCSE; any less and it could suggest that the school had a major problem with kids dropping out of education entirely in year 11. </p> <p>\"Within the Ofsted report there is a section labelled 'Key Issues'. I would look extremely closely at these. Some may bother you, others may not. For example, if it was reported that the school had no regular act of religious worship, I would not be at all concerned; if, however, it said that the school needed to make significant progress in English then I would want to know from the teaching staff what steps had been taken to act on this. </p> <p>\"Finally I would look in the school prospectus for the difference between the boys' and girls' GCSE results. If there was a significant difference, it would suggest that not much was being demanded of the kids and that they were being left to get on with it themselves. As a rule, girls are more conscientious than boys and will do the work even when they're not supervised. Boys will generally use the opportunity to do nothing.\" </p> <p><strong> The headteacher</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> John Adam is head of Crookhorn Community School in Waterlooville, Hants. He has three children.</strong> </p> <p> \"After reading the school report on the Ofsted website (<a href=\"http://www.ofsted.gov.uk\">www.ofsted.gov.uk</a>), the first piece of information I would want is the figure for the average total passes at GCSE, as the headline figures of five or more passes at grade C or above give an incomplete picture. Schools can achieve good headline figures in a number of subtle ways; some may even make it clear to parents that less able children will struggle at the school. This may deter them from applying. Schools are under severe pressure and they can focus their main teaching effort on those who stand a good chance of reaching grade C and above at potential cost to the others. I would like to see how many children were not entered for any GCSEs and how many had five passes at any grade to assess how well the school had helped the less able to fulfil their potential. </p> <p>\"I would also want to know that the headteacher took full responsibility for everything that went on within the school. A key question to ask here is what line the school takes on children who misbehave on the way to and from school. A good head will consider that the school's reputation extends well beyond the front gate. </p> <p>\"Not all schools are organised in the same way, so I would be keen to know whether pupils are taught in mixed ability groups or in group ability sets. If they were taught in sets I would want to know on what basis the assessment is made and what opportunities exist for movement between the different groupings and when they will happen. </p> <p>\"To see how the school communicated with parents, I would ask to see a typical report, with the child's name blanked out, to check that it was in clear English - intelligible and informative about a child's progress, in regard to his or her potential and also in relation to peers. I would also want to know how often reports would be issued and how often the school would be in touch with me. </p> <p>\"All schools have to impose sanctions on their pupils, but a good school would do so within a framework of rewards that reinforces positive behaviour. Children have to be made aware when they have done wrong but they need to know they have a second chance, so I would question teachers carefully about this. </p> <p>\"Parents are a good source of information, though some have private agendas. To offset this I would target members of the Parent Teacher Association, particularly those who have had two or three children at the school. PTA members will have had direct involvement with the school and its teachers and are best placed to talk about the ethos and policies of the school. Staff turnover can also give a pointer to staff morale, but one would want to be careful about jumping to conclusions. If staff were moving to take on deputy headships or other promotions, you could assume that the school was a great training ground for teachers and therefore good for your child. A simple question asking how many new members of staff the school has taken on should be sufficient to get this information. </p> <p>\"Most schools are experts at putting their best foot forward at open days, but they can't cover up the basic maintenance of the buildings. If it looks really shabby, then it is likely that school morale is low. While looking at classroom displays I would want to see that the full range of abilities are represented, not just the best. </p> <p>\"I would find it hard to believe there was any school that was unaffected by bullying and the school prospectus should state its policy clearly. However, I would also want to check this out with other parents and pupils. Pupils are always a good source of feedback and I would give my child the chance to visit the school and talk to the other children. </p> <p>\"Finally, I would check how open the school was to external benchmarking, such as Investors in People (the Cabinet Office charter mark for quality public services), Investors in Careers (run by the Careers Service) and the School's Curriculum Award (run by the School's Curriculum Award Trust). Of course, it's not essential for a school to get involved in these, but the assessments are rigorous, so you will know the school has the self-confidence to welcome external evaluation.\" </p> <p><strong> The head of department</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Marion Bird is head of religious and social education at Orleans Park School, Twickenham, London. She has three children.</strong> </p> <p> \"You can get a good feel for a school at a visit by observing the relationships between teachers and children. Are the pupils helping out, asking questions and generally getting involved or are the teachers doing all the work? If it's the latter, there's a fair chance the school may not be a dynamic and exciting place for children to learn. </p> <p>\"I would want to see a range of work on display to be reassured that all ability groups were included. I wouldn't be too worried about seeing spelling mistakes in exercise books, but I would expect to see signs that learning was taking place, so I would be looking out for encouraging comments next to work, together with some form of obvious assessment. </p> <p>\"It's hard for schools to gloss over weak points as parents have access to league table results and Ofsted reports, but most parents tend to focus on English, maths and science. I would also want to know more about other departments, especially if my child had expressed an interest in them. </p> <p>\"The head's address at an open day can also be a good indicator. It may be well rehearsed but if they speak with passion and leadership, it's likely they speak the same way at assembly; if it's downbeat manner then the kids are almost certainly going to find the headteacher uninspirational too, and won't be motivated to do their best. </p> <p>\"The best way to find out about a school, though, is to ask questions of the staff and pupils. A good, confident school will allow its senior pupils to take parents on a tour; they will be mostly diplomatic but they can be quite open, too. Hopefully, your child will be able to come with you on the tour and this is their opportunity to ask about anything that has been worrying them. However, do talk through all their concerns before the visit so that you can discuss them with staff and pupils if your child doesn't.\" </p> <p><strong> The teacher</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Elena Mauro is special needs coordinator at Loughborough Junior School in London. She has one son and one stepdaughter.</strong> </p> <p> \"Parents often find it hard to be realistic about their children's abilities, but you can't make an accurate assessment of a school without making an informed judgment of what your child needs. You need to ask yourself questions like, 'Is he better at maths than English and in what sort of environment does he learn best?' Only then can you ask the right questions to find out whether the school can be responsive to those needs. For instance, if I had a child with special needs I would want to know that there would be provision from day one and not halfway through the first term. </p> <p>\"League tables give a very partial view: I would want to know details of the intake and the proportion of special needs or bilingual children to get an idea of how much value the school has added. And if there are kids hanging around aimlessly then you can safely assume that morale is low. </p> <p>\"Secondary schools are an alien world to primary schools, and children have to go from being big babies to mini-adults in the course of the summer. Many find it very difficult to adjust to the transition of not having one class teacher and having to learn their way round a new environment where they are the youngest, so I would want to know what measures the school took to ease the new intake into the routine. For the same reasons, I would also want to know that there would be some children with similar backgrounds to my child's so that he would fit in and make friends. </p> <p>\"I would also want to see examples of the children's work in all age groups. Standards can vary in different year groups and I would want to be satisfied that progress was being made year on year. To make sure I wasn't just being shown the best work, I would like each child's work books to be made available.\"</p>",
  "<p>Warning: There is a very real risk of the UK business environment turning into a state of information paranoia. The government may promise to deliver transparent and open management of the economy, but we in the internet sector are seeing a probing and increasingly secretive establishment. </p> <p>People automatically switch off when they see that the regulation of investigatory powers (Rip) bill relates to computer communications. This attitude seems to be reflected in the House of Commons, where only 40 or so MPs bothered to turn up for the bill's second reading. For the third reading there were only 30. The only decent debate took place in House of Lords. </p> <p>The bill states clearly that: \"Emails can be intercepted for the purpose of safeguarding the economic wellbeing of the UK.\" One could therefore assume that the bill will enhance the economic \"health\" of our country. Quite the contrary is, in fact, true. This rushed and rather sketchily defined piece of legislation will make the UK a less attractive location for the headquarters of international companies. </p> <p>This bill has a somewhat conspiratorial and Big Brotherly edge to it. Take the recent BMW Longbridge affair. It was definitely in the UK's economic interest to keep the car manufacturing plant open. Under Rip legislation the government could have intercepted BMW's electronic communications between Germany and the UK. Economic fairplay? I don't think so. I doubt if foreign investors would either. This legislation is giving global businesses a major disincentive to deal with the UK. </p> <p>The business community is also concerned about a clause in Part 3 of the bill, which sets out the remit for the \"notice of disclosure requirements\", whereby senior members of a company are required to allow government agencies access to encrypted communications through the submission of an \"encryption key\". These notices must be served to a senior member of the company, that is the company director or secretary. According to the bill this person can be prosecuted if he reveals the details to anyone, and could receive a jail sentence of up to five years. If a director can be imprisoned for tipping off fellow board members of the notice, this has serious corporate governance implications. It makes it illegal to tell someone what the government has required you to do. I see the need for more balanced investigatory powers for fraud, terrorism or sex crimes, which this legislation also tries to address. </p> <p>Of concern is the possibility to interrogate computer systems of perfectly legal companies.Other countries have learnt to adapt. In Singapore the government has carried out a complete U-turn on the issue of encryption of electronic communications. Just a year ago all business emails in Singapore came through government-owned servers. Now all barriers on the import of cryptographic equipment have been lifted. Singapore is an extremely attractive location for regional offices, global headquarters, or for use as a main communications hub for internet connectivity. </p> <p>Parts 1 and 2 of the legislation are now law, but part 3 is not expected to be enforced until late 2001. A period of six to eight weeks \"consultation\" between government and industry will be announced before this. I urge everyone to review this legislation and to make their views known. </p> <p>\u0095 Richard Latham is chief executive officer of Bluewave, an online creations company based in the UK</p>",
  "<p>It has become fashionable to say that exchanges no longer count for much in the modern financial world. They are little more than the IT departments of the markets - markets which will always sort themselves, as efficient markets do. </p> <p>Even this newspaper's leader column has stated, quite bluntly, that it no longer matters who owns the London Stock Exchange, for all its 200 years of existence. </p> <p>But now there are disturbing whispers that the LSE's current management, chairman Don Cruickshank and marketing director Martin Wheatley, are taking such opinions literally. </p> <p>They are said to have abandoned any pretence of having a vision for the future. No battle plan is under construction, no energetic display of why this institution should remain independent - or why, in fact, any of the management might deserve to keep their jobs. </p> <p>They assume that, whatever the LSE says or does now, shareholders will just automatically vote down the hostile takeover from Sweden's OM Gruppen. The thinking now is to stop thinking. It is too risky: the LSE cannot whip out a new strategy or alternative merger from the hat since it has not time, under the bid timetable, to get it right. Such a move would lack credibility. </p> <p>Oh, and it might get things wrong again. </p> <p>In any case, it is said, why rush around for a fix when the London equity market is not broken? The technology is fine and we have the biggest pool of captive liquidity in Europe. </p> <p>This is complacent in the extreme. In fact, those who have been briefed on the new non-strategy reckon Mr Cruickshank and his colleagues need some help, and sharpish. So here goes: </p> <p>First the LSE should identify its crucial weaknesses before their competitors point them out. The trading technology is substandard. Teething problems with the Sets order book have been going on for a short five years. In particular, there have been persistent problems setting credible end-of-day prices for companies of all shapes and sizes. This is fundamental, since the price-setting mechanism is perhaps the single, most important reason for an exchange to exist. </p> <p>Clearing and settlement systems are cumbersome, costly and lack international reach. The LSE might protest that it is no longer responsible for such matters, having been stripped of its role by the Bank of England. But for anyone trading British equities it does matter. </p> <p>The LSE's customers - and, awkwardly, its shareholders - are split into two, broad, opposing camps. Neither feels its needs are being met. The split has been there for 14 years so the LSE should probably stop hoping that if the matter is ignored it will disappear. </p> <p>Next, the LSE needs to identify its key strengths. </p> <p>Its history, time zone and language has enabled the exchange to retail a substantial majority of all European equity trading. </p> <p>Its procedures and rules are well established and well tested, while regulation in London has reached a level of professionalism that is second only to New York. On the whole, market participants here feel they operate in a fair environment. </p> <p>Levels of probity and corporate governance in London are far higher than in any other European centre. </p> <p>Moving forward from here, the LSE needs that vision thing - a view of where the business is headed. There are alternatives to the usual mergers or alliance options, but it first requires the re-telling of the cautionary tale of a newspaper - the Financial Times. </p> <p>Two years ago the paper set out to use the internet to create a global online product with a global brand, FT.com. Stephen Hill, the chief executive, toured Sillicon Valley for advice. The big technology firms all told him one thing: great idea, do not do it yourself. In fact, one firm, Hewlett Packard, offered to fund, build and run the entire infrastruture simply in return for a small cut of future e-commerce revenues. </p> <p>So the FT decided to manage the project itself, contracting out work to specialist firms rather than going for one big partner. The result was a badly designed website, full of technical glitches, which has failed to destroy the competition to boot. </p> <p>FT.com has failed to reflect and distribute the exceptional qualities of the newspaper. A great idea was bungled. </p> <p>So, back to the LSE. It already has a sizeable portion of pan-European business and also has a brand with global potential. It also has a rulebook that is respected, and international - that is, American - standards of disclosure. </p> <p>What the LSE needs is a big, blue-chip technology partner that has a commercial interest - through a stake or a trading toll - in making the business hum. </p> <p>It needs to build an international infrastructure that is efficient and cheap and does everything - for everyone. It needs to promote London's standards as the international benchmark - and it needs to market the hell out of the whole package. </p> <p>Oh, and it also needs a chief executive.</p>",
  "<p>Children's television specialist HIT Entertainment said yesterday that pre-school favourite Bob the Builder has laid some solid foundations for the group's new consumer products and video division. </p> <p>Demand for Bob videos and associated merchandising quadrupled consumer product income in the year to July 31 and now accounts for 43% of group income compared with 11% a year ago, chief executive Peter Orton said.</p> <p>About 76% of that income came from Britain but with Bob episodes now showing in 100 countries around the world Mr Orton is forecasting further sharp growth on a global scale.</p> <p>\"We have only just scratched the surface of potential licensing and merchandising income,\" he said. \"These figures do not include sales in Japan where Bob is incredibly popular and he starts to go on air in the US five times a week from January. If the response there is anything like it has been here we could be in for some very interesting times.\"</p> <p>Turnover for the period climbed 32% to \u00a320.3m, while profit before tax leapt 59% to \u00a35m.

  "Conservative plans to turn the tide in favour of England's cities by creating new private sector led regeneration companies to tear down tower blocks, build new schools, and reclaim derelict sites, have yet to be costed, William Hague admitted yesterday. <p>Unveiled at the start of the 2000 Tory conference yesterday as a sign of a \"bold new social agenda\", they appeared to urban analysts to be a mix of current government initiatives and old programmes which have been widely criticised as often wasteful and ineffective. </p> <p>Among Mr Hague's plans are fresh curbs on greenfield sites in the crowded south-east and fast-track planning permission for \"brownfield\" urban sites in the midlands and north, plus a host of incentives to make decayed inner cities more attractive to ambitious people now heading south. </p> <p>Communities will be able to bring in extra police - paid for from their regeneration budget - and neighbours will be able to trigger the anti-social behaviour orders which Labour introduced against so-called families from hell. The deterrent will result in fewer evictions, not more, Mr Hague predicted. </p> <p>Flanked by senior members of his team the opposition leader promised that a future Tory government would appoint a special regeneration minister, possibly of cabinet rank, to cut through red tape and ensure speedy action across areas from planning, to crime and education. </p> <p>Challenged at his press conference to say where his overall vision of urban renewal differs from the public/private partnership approach of John Prescott, the deputy prime minister, Mr Hague insisted that Labour had \"waffled\" about partnership and cross-departmental \"joined-up government\" in Whitehall, but had not achieved much. </p> <p>His environment spokesman, Archie Norman, said that in three years poverty and crime were up, as were homeless and other indices of urban decay. Even spending on inner city regeneration was down, said the former Asda chief whose revival of the supermarket chain took him into inner city politics. </p> <p>Also drawing heavily on some urban initiatives in the US - but not offering US-style tax breaks - Mr Hague and Ann Widdecombe, the shadowe home secretary, took the populist line of floating \"cops in shops\", with officers operating from shops in communities to lead the fight against crime and be visible as both a deterrent and an reassurance. </p> <p>The police will also be urged to use empty property as bases to stop them being used by gangs. \"I believe we are ready to be a government because we are ready to govern for all the people and that means tackling the problems of our inner cities,\" the Tory leader said. He told his news confer ence in Bournemouth: \"Millions of people live and bring up children in our inner cities. The cultural life of the nation beats to a distinctly urban rhythm ... while it is certainly true that many city centres have enjoyed a renaissance in recent years, the residential areas that surround them have too often remained places of great deprivation and poverty.\" </p> <p>The last 30 years had seen a huge exodus from inner cities as middle-income families moved out to the suburbs, putting enormous pressure on \"precious\" green belts. </p> <p>High levels of unemployment, crime, poor schools, drug problems had also taken over too many areas. \"These social problems are most evident in the vast concrete tower block estates that scar our urban landscape.\" </p> <p>Part of the Tory solution is to create regeneration companies, with a relatively short life-span, which will have powers to buy and sell land, pay grants to developers, and even draw up contracts with local schools, and police, to improve conditions in run-down areas. </p> <p>Their concept appears similar to 12 English urban devel opment corporations - albeit with wider powers - the last of which was abolished after Labour came to power. While devouring hundreds of millions of pounds from the Department of the Environment, they were criticised for often side-steeping social problems and concentrating purely on bricks and mortar. A few were beset by scandals, with the National Audit Office criticising the performance of some. </p> <p>Labour has created three regeneration companies in Liverpool, East Manchester, and Sheffield with more likely to be outlined in an white paper.</p>"
