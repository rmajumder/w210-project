  "Russia is a proud country and its leadership's refusal of all foreign help in trying to rescue the tragically disabled submarine which now lies at the bottom of the Barents Sea is eloquent proof of that. There may be technical reasons why no outside assistance could contribute, given the size of the craft's escape hatches and their incompatibility with western rescue vessels' underwater docking systems. This is not the Mir space station. There are also national security reasons for Russia's decision. Its relations with the west are better than they have been for at least half a century, but naval warfare technology is still jealously guarded. That is clear from the way Nato ships and submarines were closely shadowing the manoeuvres which brought the Kursk to disaster. Manoeuvres provide a key opportunity for foreign experts to gauge a navy's potential and Russia's military chiefs are probably wary of letting outsiders get too near to the stricken boat, even if their ostensible purpose is to help. <p>Yet pride remains the main factor. The Kursk was the centrepiece of Russia's nuclear deterrent force. While other recent disasters in Russia have been blamed on ageing equipment or technological backwardness, this is less likely to be true for a submarine which was only commissioned five years ago. The Kursk was at the head of the line and it may well be that it was poor maintenance, low morale and lax discipline which brought disaster, rather than design faults. Nevertheless, to accept that foreigners have the wherewithal to save the submarine, while Russia does not, would amount to an admission of technical inferiority that President Putin is unwilling to make. </p> <p>During the cold war there was a widespread tendency in the west to exaggerate the Soviet Union's strength. Paranoia about the enemy often overcame sound judgment. Today there may be a tendency to exaggerate Russia's weakness. Russia is a major competitor in the world's marketplace for arms and there must be a commercial temptation for western countries to try to undermine the Russian \"brand\" by constantly highlighting any problems of technology or obsolescence that emerge. Foreign sympathy for Russia's current difficulties can often be more feigned than genuine. </p> <p>Mr Putin is enough of a realist to know this. As Russia's economy starts on a modest revival, thanks largely to a surge in oil prices, he has been trying to create a new international position for the country. In his recently published \"Foreign Policy Concept\" not only is the old confidence of superpower status long gone: the president does not even refer to the country as a great or major power. While advocating Russia's full integration into the world economy, he warns of a growing risk that Russia's economy and its \"information environment\" will depend on outside factors. The subtext is \"American cultural imperialism\", and France, China, and the Muslim world are other proud cultures which have similar fears. But none of this means that Mr Putin is giving up. As a permanent member of the security council, Russia can still influence the creation of a new world order, he argues, as long as its actions are based on consistency and predictability. He promises to replace ideological stereotyping with pragmatism and says Russia can have good relations with Nato in some fields, even though at other levels Nato's strategy goes against Russia's security interests. These are sentiments which command respect. The Kursk disaster is a grim accident - not a metaphor for humiliation, nor the end of Russian power.</p>",
  "<p>Al Gore's choice of Senator Joseph Lieberman as his vice-presidential candidate ensures that if he wins the presidency, there will be two people in the White House who care about global warming. </p> <p>Lieberman welcomed the Kyoto Treaty on reducing carbon emissions, and has introduced a bill on the subject in the Senate. At the Kyoto conference, he applauded when Gore made his impassioned appeal for an agreement, while others in the American congressional delegation sat on their hands. </p> <p>Lieberman is co-sponsor of a clean energy bill that supports renewable energy sources for producing electricity, and he has talked about solar power and hydrogen as fuels. He also introduced a bill in the Senate looking forward to a domestic market in carbon emissions. A company would be given permission to emit a certain amount of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, and if it reduces its emissions below that level, it can sell its permit for the surplus. This uses market forces, which American business likes, rather than taxation, which it does not. </p> <p>Lieberman's bill authorises the president to give credit to a company that reduces its emissions now, which could be cashed in if or when an emission trading scheme is introduced. \"I think a trading scheme will come,\" Lieberman said recently. \"As for the Kyoto Treaty, I think America will come on board eventually. We want a leadership role in the world and we should have one in this area. </p> <p>Lieberman disagrees with the EU over how the US should achieve its Kyoto targets. He thinks the US should be allowed to do this by international trading - by paying other countries to do the reducing, either by financing tree-planting schemes or buying their surplus reductions. Europeans point out that the Kyoto Treaty says such mechanisms should be supplemental to domestic reductions. They want to see the US making an effort at home. </p> <p>\u0095 Norman Moss's book Managing the Planet is due out next month, published by Earthscan, price \u00a316.99</p>",
  "<p>In the blazing heat of the desert, a lake ought be a welcome sight. But this lake has no palm trees around its edges, no camels watering. The sand here is a dark, sticky brown, turning to black at the lake's fringes. The smell is foul. </p> <p>On the far side, an abandoned Iraqi tank stands as a reminder of how this lake, in Kuwait's Burgan oilfield, and around 320 others like it, came into existence. During the Gulf war, occupying Iraqi forces released more than 60m barrels of oil on to the sands, forming lakes as deep as a swimming pool in places. </p> <p>Ten years on, they are still there. The Kuwaitis have pumped out a third of the oil, reducing the lakes to a shallow sludge. But the rest has sunk into the ground, five to six metres deep. As years go by, the oil continues to creep between the sand particles, contaminating more and more land. </p> <p>The Kuwaitis estimate that the cost of putting it right will be about $1bn, but oil-polluted earth has never been treated on this scale before and techniques are still in their infancy. A conference to discuss the options will be held in a few months. Dr Mohammed al-Sarawi, head of Kuwait's environment public authority, is hopeful that a Japanese bio-remediation method, which uses bacteria to break down the oil, will prove effective. Whatever is done, it will take time. </p> <p>Almost two years ago, Green Cross International, the Swiss-based organisation which monitors the environmental effects of war, reported that the situation was becoming urgent. \"In a few years, it will be too late to remedy the desert because the volume of contaminated sand will be too large\", it warned. \"The desert will be contaminated forever.\" </p> <p>Green Cross suggested that to prevent further contamination, about 50m cubic metres of earth should be dug out and put into safe storage until a solution could be found. Even that is likely to be hazardous: there are still some Iraqi landmines in and around the lakes. </p> <p>It is not just a matter of restoring the land to its natural state: Kuwait's water supply is also affected, and several water wells have already been shut down because of oil seepage. </p> <p>Kuwait depends heavily on desalinated seawater, but it also uses fresh groundwater from the south, and adds some brackish groundwater to the distilled seawater to give it flavour. According to Green Cross, one aquifer representing 40% of the fresh water reserves has been contaminated. </p> <p>The oil lakes, together with the 720 oil wells set on fire at the end of the war, were partly aimed at damaging Kuwait's economy - a gesture of spite by the fleeing Iraqis. But oil was also used as a weapon. The Iraqis thought the allies might attempt a landing in Kuwait from the sea, and poured an estimated eight to 11m barrels into the sea as a deterrent. This was about six times larger than the Amoco Cadiz disaster - the world's previous largest oil spill - and some 1,500 kilometres of Gulf coastline were polluted as a result. </p> <p>As a further defensive measure, the Iraqis moored four supertankers, each containing a million barrels, in the bay off Kuwait. These were fitted with special taps so they could pour out the oil if an attack came via the sea. Further north, towards Iraq, they sank 150 small boats in shallow waters of the fish breeding grounds to hamper navigation. </p> <p>The end of the war brought a huge clean-up operation, and the oil fires were finally extinguished after 258 days. But some of the problems caused by this environmental warfare are only now becoming apparent. </p> <p>While the fires burned, a thick cloud of black smoke, carrying soot and toxic gases, hung over Kuwait, making it so dark that cars had to use their headlights even at midday. Huge areas are still covered in soot and doctors report increased cases of asthma, allergies and eye irritation. </p> <p>The burning oil gave off aromatic hydrocarbons which can cause cancer. Dr Abdullah al-Hammadi, who runs a government clinic specialising in post-war problems, believes that most of the population inhaled a toxic dose - though it will take another five to 10 years before the effect is known. </p> <p>The desert in Kuwait consists mainly of hard-packed sand and stones, giving it a firm, stable surface, though there are smaller areas of sand dunes. According to Sarawi, the area covered by dunes normally fluctuates by 10-15% but has more than doubled in size since the war. \"We have also had a record number of dust storms over the last five to six years,\" he says. </p> <p>Although such dramatic changes are usually due to climate change, he believes that in Kuwait they are a result of the war. During the war, the Iraqis drove a corridor across the desert from the north-west to the south-east, and the movement of hundreds of tanks broke up the surface. Because the desert supports so little life, it is especially susceptible to damage. \"The top layer of the ecosystem is very fragile,\" says Sarawi. </p> <p>On the wall in Sarawi's office is a photograph which, at first glance, appears to show a buttercup meadow. It is, in fact, a stretch of desert in full bloom a few weeks after rain has fallen. The seeds for these plants lie dormant, normally just below the surface, but the drifting sand has begun to cover them to depths which prevent them from growing. </p> <p>Unlike the desert, the sea has a remarkable capacity for recovery. Seven years after the war, the coral reefs seemed healthy and shrimp catches were back to normal. But then another problem appeared. Last year, huge numbers of fish suddenly died - the Kuwaitis estimated some 400-500 tonnes. Tests on the fish found no toxins, and scientists concluded that they had died from lack of oxygen in the water, caused by an explosive growth of phytoplanktons. </p> <p>High temperatures may have played a part, but the most likely explanation is an abnormally high level of nutrients in the water. The Kuwaitis suspect that the draining of Iraq's southern marshes, carried out by Saddam Hussein for reasons of political control over the area, is to blame. Previously the marshes acted as a filter for fertilisers washed down from further north in Iraq, but now there are no marshes to remove them, these nutrients pass straight into the sea. This encourages algae blooms which use all the oxygen and kill normal life. </p> <p>The waters at the head of the Gulf are a major breeding ground for fish from as far away as the Indian Ocean. Millions of people in the Gulf and Asia depend on them for food, as do fishermen for their livelihood. </p> <p>The Gulf war may be over, but Saddam's war against the environment continues.</p>",
  "<p><strong> UK loses first wind </strong><br> Morocco is inviting tenders to build two wind farms totalling 200 megawatt capacity - about 8% of the country's electricity needs. Only one in 10 of the rural poor have power at the moment and wind farms are seen as part of the solution. In the UK where the DTI and Helen Liddell, the energy minister, continue to tilt the market towards fossil fuels, the industry still struggles for survival, with less than 1% of the market. This is despite the fact we have more wind resource than any country in Europe, particularly offshore, where even the scenic countryside lobby find it hard to object to the technology. The DTI's attitude is particularly puzzling since the UK was once the world leader in this field and there is plenty of business out there. In this climate, with no home base to work from, it is not surprising that none of the companies tendering for the Moroccan contracts are British. </p> <p><strong> Healthy heather</strong><br> The glorious 12th (the start of the grouse shooting season) last week-end saw some cheerful news for the bird's heather habitat, if not for the grouse. New research shows that the steep decline in heather moorland is being reversed. Over 160,000 acres of new moorland have been created or brought back into management by re-seeding, bracken control and reduction in grazing, replacing some 200,000 acres lost since 1945. More sympathetic management is good news for curlew, golden plover, dotterel, lapwing, and predators like merlin, shorteared owl, hen harrier and peregrine. </p> <p><strong> Fired into action</strong><br> With large tracts of the US on fire and Al Gore needing the green vote in his presidential bid, he has added an 8,000 word foreword to his 1992 book, Earth in the Balance, for re-issue next month by Earthscan. The catchy title of the new chapter is \"The coming environment decade\" and top of his concerns is global warming which, needless to say, the US must tackle, he says. So far top marks, Al, as long as we ignore the last eight years of relative inaction. </p> <p><strong> Britain goes batty</strong><br> One last piece of good news: a colony of rare Barbastelle bats has been discovered in Wales - the first in that country, and the fifth in Britain. In all, 10 of the 16 species of British bat were found in Pengelli Forest Nature reserve using sonar detectors and giving hope of other discoveries elsewhere.</p>",
  "<p>Plastic is a fraud. It cheats the laws of nature. It is born, but does not ever really die. Plastic is designed to be impervious to natural decay, which is why it's so useful for wrapping sweaty sandwiches in. Because it doesn't erode, this makes it an ecological nightmare. </p> <p>Twelve billion plastic bags are handed out to shoppers in Britain every year. Tesco's and Sainsbury's alone each hand out 1bn. </p> <p>Most plastic ends up in a landfill site. It will never biodegrade, but thanks to the biological conditions which exist in landfills, neither will organic waste such as onion clippings or hamburgers, which can remain intact for decades, 27m tonnes of it accumulating year by year. If someone in the future excavates these sites, they almost certainly will be living on a planet empty of blue whales, elephants and tigers. What they will have, however, are billions and billions of bags with the word Asda or Miss Selfridge stamped on the side. </p> <p>New government targets (50% of rubbish to be recycled or used for energy from waste projects by 2010), may mean that plastic bags in the future will be recycled, but this will be tricky. One problem is that a variety of plastics exist which cannot be recycled together. Conta mination or mixing of plastics may render the recyclate (the product of recycling) unusable, and even when successful, plastics can only be recycled a few times. Certainly the bags we use today are highly unlikely to be recycled. Of the 15m plastic bottles used in the UK every day, less than 3% get recycled, and the number of plastic bags recycled is currently not monitored. </p> <p>The seabed is becoming increasingly \"plasticised\". Half a kilometre down, plastic bags float on the bottom of the Mediterranean in densities of up to 80 items per hectare; and 550 plastic bottles per kilometre were recovered in a recent survey of Bristol Channel coast. Even on the paradisaical beaches of the uninhab ited South Pacific islands, plastic bags waft up and down the shores. </p> <p>In Indonesia, plastic bags have been reported clogging up the pumps at water refineries. Turtles in the Bay of Biscay commonly die of ingestion of plastic bags. Seabirds too, have plastic fragments in their stomachs, and plastic molecules in their muscles. In California it is not uncommon for sea-lions to end up in rehabilitation centres with plastics wrapped around their necks. </p> <p>On land, plastic bags do just as much damage. In South Africa, they end up ulcerating the bellies of cattle. The cow may die, its corpse decompose, but the bag will live on once liberated from the body whose death it induced. </p> <p>The irony of plastic waste as a serious environmental problem is that, unlike fossil fuel consumption or rainforest destruction or coral reef bleaching, it is easily solvable. Plastic is an immensely useful material. We use it, however, as though it has no downside at all. </p> <p>We must reduce our use of plastic. As shoppers we should use non-disposable bags to carry shopping, or simply refuse a bag when we buy something. We have a national obsession with wrapping everything in plastic; it is unnecessary and environmentally, deadly.</p>",
  "<p>In round concrete tanks and temporary buildings on the edge of a deep Scottish loch an experiment is under way that could change the face of fish farming in Britain. A company called Aquascot, already involved in farming salmon, trout and turbot, is attempting to become the first commercial hatchery for cod. If successful, this would be the first species once caught in huge numbers by Britain's sea-going fleets to be reared artificially. </p> <p>Aquascot has already grown the first British batch of farmed cod to hit the fish slab. Earlier this year Marks and Spencer sold 4,000 fish, weighing about 10 tonnes, grown from eggs taken from wild fish caught off Mallaig, in the Scottish Highlands, and cultivated in publicly funded research labs. Three to four times that amount will probably soon be on their way to M&amp;S and Waitrose. </p> <p>But other fish from the same wild source are now being given a variety of feeds, lighting regimes and water temperatures in an effort to reproduce the conditions of their traditional February spawning season and develop an efficient breeding stock. So far fertilised eggs collected at the farm at Ardtaraig on Loch Striven, on Scotland's west coast, have failed to survive the near 10 days they need in an incubator before developing into the minute fish that will grow into Britain's best known partner for chips. </p> <p>Even when that process is successfully negotiated, the company must learn how to manage a further four months of the complicated growth process, in which the young cod, unlike young farmed salmon, need live feed before transferring to a dried pellet diet. Keith Agnew, an Aquascot director, said: \"They are very easily domesticated but we are only at the first hurdle. I think this will take 10 years to become big scale. We have to develop a whole new system. It is not the same as salmon farming.\" </p> <p>In the 14 years since salmon farming really took hold, by getting near the 10,000 tonne mark it has created a new market for a fish that for most of the 20th century hit only posh people's plates. Scottish farms will produce about 120,000 tonnes of salmon this year and form an industry supporting 6,500 jobs, more than two-thirds in the Highlands and Islands region. </p> <p>In contrast, Britain's conventional fishermen have recently produced little more than a third of the 170,000 tonnes of cod needed annually here. The rest is imported. \"We could be producing 50,000 tonnes of cod [in Scotland] annually once we have the technology cracked,\" said Mr Agnew. Supermarkets are watching the experiments closely. So are big brand names such as Birds Eye and McDonald's. </p> <p>Mr Agnew believes most cod farming, as with salmon, can be done in cages in the sea, at least after fish pass the juvenile phase. With sites near the coasts around the Scottish mainland and its islands in short supply, because they are taken by salmon or are unsuitable for environmental reasons, he is looking for alternatives. He has a vision of new businesses setting up in deeper water as the technology develops. \"Look at what the oil industry has done because the prize was there. You could have nurseries on shore, but there is no reason why farms should not be on the ocean bottom.\" Fishermen who once trawled the seas for cod could make a living as stockmen or maintenance workers. </p> <p>Eventually, Mr Agnew is planning a life cycle of less than two years for farmed cod, a quicker turnround than for other farmed fish in Scotland. Other species may follow. </p> <p>However, fish farming techniques have been criticised by scientists and environmentalists. Problems are worst in Asia where mangrove forests have been destroyed to farm shrimps for the European and US markets, but even in Scotland there has been excessive use of chemicals and the spread of disease to wild fish populations because of pollution and parasites such as ticks. In the worst cases pollution from fish farms, particularly in shallow coastal waters, have wiped out all other sea life. </p> <p>Global production of farmed fish and shellfish has doubled in the past 15 years as wild stocks have disappeared. Altogether 220 species are farmed. In Asia thousands of farms make millions of pounds exporting prawns to the west. In China, carp production accounts for half the world's fish farming, nearly all of it for Chinese consumption. </p> <p>The problem is what most farmed fish eat. Carp and some shellfish eat plants or bits of food already in the water. Farming them, and allowing them to feed naturally, makes a large contribution to the amount of extra fish available for human consumption. </p> <p>But other large species normally eat smaller prey in the same water and so have to be fed artificially. According to international research by five universities, instead of being the saviour of supplies, fish farming could be contributing to overfishing. Rosamond Taylor, of Stanford University, California, said commercial fleets had switched from fishing for species for human consumption to providing the raw material for food for fish farming. </p> <p>Between 1986 and 1997 four of the top five species captured by ocean fishing fleets, and eight of the top 20, were used in feed production for aquaculture and livestock industries. </p> <p>The study says \"the growing aquaculture industry cannot continue to rely on finite stocks of wild-caught fish, a number of which are already classified as fully exploited, overexploited or depleted\". Continuing such operations would be disastrous for marine ecosystems, and stunt the growth of farm fishing too.</p>",
  "Trust Jesse Jackson to put his finger on it. The veteran civil rights leader and former presidential candidate always had a knack for the killer soundbite - and he seems to have passed it on to his son. For Jesse Jackson Jr, congressman from Illinois, identified the Democrats' key task as they gather in Los Angeles this week: \"We've got to get Bill Clinton out of town as quickly as possible.\" <p>Young Jesse was speaking literally - about the party managers' plan to bundle the president on the first available flight out of LA, taking Hillary and Chelsea with him. But Jackson's point went beyond mere travel arrangements. He was voicing the sentiment of all those working to get Al Gore elected in November: they want Clinton out of the spotlight and their man in it. Every minute the president spends hogging the bright glow of national adulation is another 60 seconds for Gore to kick his heels in the grey chill of the waiting room. When the two men finally met for a \"torch-passing\" event in Michigan late yesterday, the Gore staff could barely conceal their relief. Now, they hope, the focus will move away from the eight years of Clinton - and on to four for Gore. </p> <p>But it won't be easy. Anyone watching the president's swansong address on Monday could see that. The camera panned across faces mesmerised by Clinton's sheer star power. Their eyes were wide open, rapt in attention; they bit their lower lips when he did, as if in solidarity. And when he gave them the slightest cue, they cheered and cheered. </p> <p>There are not many politicians who could get away with as weird an entrance as Clinton dared. A camera showed him alone and without entourage, walking through the corridors and stairwells of the convention centre, before emerging through a tunnel and on to the stage: he looked like Russell Crowe in Gladiator. He may, as he told the Democratic devout, now come \"with hair greyer and wrinkles deeper\", but he is at the peak of his powers: it is hard to think of a more charismatic performer in any field, music or the arts or sport, anywhere in the world. </p> <p>And yet, though only 54 years old this week, Bill Clinton will soon have to walk away from the job he so obviously loves. There is no logic to it: he wants to carry on doing it and the voters want to let him. Polls show consistently that if the constitution allowed it, Bill Clinton would walk a third term. </p> <p>This is what Al Gore is up against. It is not that he's without assets: he is a fine looking man with a sharp brain (tomorrow night he will break with political custom by delivering a speech he has written himself). And he has some star power of his own: he will be formally nominated by his old Harvard room-mate, the actor Tommy Lee Jones. </p> <p>Gore even has some advantages denied to the big guy. He didn't dodge the draft, but volunteered to serve in Vietnam: hence tomorrow's \"salute\" to veterans of that war, a treat that was unavailable to Bill. His family life is blameless: if Monica had dropped by Al's desk to deliver pizza, she'd have got nothing more than a plea to recycle the box. </p> <p>Yet somehow Gore adds up to less than the sum of these parts. His problem is an X-factor so nebulous and elusive, it seems cruel to punish him for lacking it: charisma. As Gail Collins wrote in yesterday's New York Times, while Clinton can make members of a large audience feel as though they're sitting in his living room after dinner, Gore \"can make people sitting in his living room after dinner feel as if they're in a large audience, taking notes\". </p> <p>The result is the shadow. He is the younger brother overshadowed by a naughtier, sexier sibling; now he has to break free. That would be hard enough if it just meant enduring constant and unflattering comparison. But Gore has a trickier act to pull off. He somehow has to stay associated with the good bits of the Clinton record - unbroken economic prosperity - yet keep his distance from the personal sleaze that marred the Clinton years. </p> <p> But here is the comforting news for Gore: he is not the only one in the shadow. He shares that problem with his opponent and indeed every politician on the American scene. They are all doing battle on ground shaped by the man they want to replace. </p> <p>So George W Bush looks only slightly better than Gore when held up to the bright TV light of Clinton. The president's Monday performance will have erased much of the lustre left over from W's squinty-eyed attempt a fortnight ago. Besides, the Clinton factor hovers above the Bush candidacy in a more direct way: it makes it a grudge match. One White House official says Bush's motivation in seeking the presidency can be captured in a single word: Daddy. W wants to avenge Clinton's defeat of Bush Sr in 1992, a victory the American right have never quite accepted. That campaign was fought as a family feud - with Barbara Bush laying into Hillary - and this one already has a similar quality. Except the Bushes' enemy is not the Gores, it's the Clintons. </p> <p>Still, the longest shadow cast by the man from Hope is on the substance of the 2000 contest. Clinton's great contribution to modern politics was what he called \"triangulation\" - recast by Tony Blair as modernisation and the third way. Clinton realised that Democrats would only win if they moved rightward on welfare, crime and the deficit. That centrist, New Democrat ground is where Gore wants to fight now. </p> <p>But Clinton's logic did not only apply to Democrats. George W realised the same was true of his own party: Republicans, too, had to move to the centre on issues where they had previously been deemed extreme. For them, that meant pensions, healthcare for the elderly, education and, most visibly, social diversity. Clinton had repeatedly beaten Republicans by casting them as right-wing and out of touch on those questions; Bush aims to defeat that charge with his centrist brand of \"compassionate conservatism\". The result was the Republicans' Cotton Club convention - lots of blacks on the stage, none in the audience - and Bush's leftward shift, promising new spending on the elderly's pensions and prescriptions. As one Democrat boss told the LA convention this week: \"The Republicans pretended they were tolerant, pretended they were moderates. . . Let's face it, they pretended they were Democrats.\" </p> <p>This is the real Clinton legacy. He has defined the ground where elections are won, and it's in his image. It says you have to be tough on welfare, defence and crime but tender on race, education and the environment. Both Democrats and Republicans failed when they were one and not the other. The result is a stampede from both sides towards the centre, with each party trying to be like the other and a blur where the old battle lines used to be - leaving personality as the decisive factor. That worked perfectly for Mr Personality himself, of course. But it hardly suits Gore. All he can do is hope that tomorrow America sees on his shoulders a light sprinkling of Clinton's magic stardust - as if fallen from the king on to his less golden heir. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:jonathan.freedland@theguardian.com\">jonathan.freedland@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "Lord Scarsdale, who has died aged 76, fought a dozen years of battles against the National Trust over its alterations to his ancestral home, Kedleston Hall in Derbyshire, and another 10 years trying to persuade the trust to take the place off his hands. <p>Francis John Nathaniel Curzon, the 3rd viscount, saw himself as \"the 30th Lord of Kedleston in an unbroken male line of descent\". His family stretches back 900 years, but his position was the result of the typical stipulation in the Scarsdale title - that it, and the estate, could go only to a male heir. </p> <p>It was only after the first wife of his predecessor, the 2nd viscount, had produced four daughters, got divorced, and fathered no heirs with his second wife, that the 2nd viscount gave up hope of a male heir. As next in line, Francis Curzon, an old Etonian captain in the Scots Guards, and son of the third son of the 4th Baron Scarsdale, was invited by a cousin he hardly knew to see the estate for the first time in 1959. </p> <p>Kedleston Hall has been one of the glories of Britain since the young Robert Adam rebuilt it for the first Baron Curzon in the 1760s, around his collection of Tintorettos, Poussins and Chippendale furniture. As the centre of an estate of 5,700 acres, it included a 500-acre park and an 18-hole golf course. </p> <p>From 1970, Scarsdale took charge of his future inheritance as estate manager. He knew, even before death duties of \u00a32.5m, that he could not keep up the property on the basis of income from the estate's 17 farms. \"The house is a gigantic headache,\" he moaned. </p> <p>Wanting to preserve it intact, he offered the pile to the nation, in lieu of death duties. The environment secretary Michael Heseltine was sympathetic, as were arts ministers Norman St John-Stevas and Lord Gowrie. Even Mrs Thatcher went to have a look. </p> <p>But while waitingfor a decision, Scarsdale came into conflict with his son Peter, to whom he had promised a tenth of the estate if sold. Peter wanted to wait for a \u00a325m offer from overseas, which never materialised. It took until 1987, a full decade, before the National Trust was willing to take over Ked- leston Hall and its estate, financed by an unprecedented \u00a314m, mainly from the National Heritage Fund. </p> <p>Lord Scarsdale made what seemed a generous deal with the trust. He and his family could live rent-free in a 23-room wing, with an adjoining garden and two rent-free flats for his servants or other family members. He could play billiards and hold parties in the main block, and shoot pheasants on the estate when it was closed to the public. Mean- while, the annual maintenance costs of \u00a3400,000 were to be met by members of the National Trust and 20,000 visitors. </p> <p>The irritation came from differing interpretations of the word \"consult\" in Scarsdale's agreement with the trust. He thought he could veto any changes; the trust insisted he would only be informed, as a courtesy. He wanted the current hall reserved as a \"family home\"; the trust wanted it restored to its 1760s glory. Scarsdale attacked the trust's \"arrogance\", \"vandalism\" and \"sacrilege\" for such things as removing a fountain or a favourite piece of furniture. </p> <p>He leaves two sons and a daughter by his first wife, Solange, and two sons by his second wife, Helene, whom he married in 1958.

The current proposal to accept a more liberal air services agreement in return for permitting alliances between airlines in order to allow UK airlines to gain access to the US domestic market may lead to a deal in the short term, but such a deal should include a clear timetable for the lifting of US restrictions on cabotage and airline ownership and Fly America policy,\" says the report. </p> <p>Only a handful of carriers, such as British Airways and Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic, are allowed to operate transatlantic services into and out of Heathrow airport. British carriers have restrictions on US destinations. The report says a new agreement will bring advantages to Britain's airlines, consumers and the economy as a whole.</p>",
  "<p>What should an airline do if its staff is in revolt, its performance has nosedived and nobody believes that its multi-billion dollar acquisition of a rival will succeed? </p> <p>United Airlines, the world's largest carrier with 2,330 flights a day, has decided that the answer is to spend $500,000 on funding this week's Democratic party convention in Los Angeles. </p> <p>The US company has been hit with a wave of bad news in the past week. Few analysts expect it to be in party spirit in spite of its generosity. Several Wall Street analysts downgraded the company's third quarter earnings estimates last week after the carrier warned that its union troubles and cancelled flights would cost at least $50m this year. </p> <p>The company has cut its September flight schedule by 3%, about 2,000 trips, citing bad weather, air traffic control issues and the unsolved dispute with its powerful pilots' union over a new contract. More than 1,000 flights were cancelled last week. United's 10,000 pilots, who together with other staff members own more than half of the company, are refusing to fly overtime. </p> <p><strong> Generosity</strong><br> </p> <p>The argument between the two sides has become more heated. United blames staff for an increase in sick days off and maintenance calls, while the unions say the company does not want to take on more pilots, which, they maintain, it desperately needs. </p> <p>The dispute is taking its toll on the company. In the first week of August fewer than 40% of United's domestic flights arrived within 15 minutes of their schedule, down from 57% in May, when the company announced its proposed $4.3bn acquisition of US Airways. Amid such turmoil, United's position as the tenth largest contributor of \"in-kind\" money to this week's Democratic convention may appear odd. The connection between the US airline industry and the country's political establishment has always been close. United, American Airlines and Northwest are among the top 70 corporate political donors in the US this year while US Airways, United's intended partner, was a significant donor to the Republican party convention. </p> <p>None of this generosity is directed at any particular issue, though the industry does need political favour to consolidate. In the last few weeks United has appointed former deputy White House chief of staff Harold Ickes to help its lobbying efforts. Mr Ickes has been an adviser to Hillary Clinton in the New York Senate race. </p> <p>United's attempt to buy US Airways, the smallest of the six main US carriers, needs regulatory approval from the department of justice. One Washington source said yesterday Mr Ickes's \"heavyweight appointment\" could help United win support for its proposed acquisition. </p> <p>It also needs to convince individual politicians in the Senate that the merger will improve current levels of service, and not lead to job cuts or fewer flights. </p> <p>At Senate hearings in June, United argued that the merger would improve service. But politicians, who were not convinced by the airline, took turns to ask what the merger meant for their constituency. One government official described the hearings as a \"public dance\". </p> <p>The head of Mercer Management Consulting's global aviation practice Peter Walsh says the merger should go ahead. \"I think some consolidation has to be good for the industry,\" he says. It would benefit both parties. It would allow United to route some of its flights through US Airways' east coast hubs rather than Chicago, which is renowned for air traffic control delays. It would also permit the smaller company to use the international network, says Mr Walsh. </p> <p>Others, such as employees and some politicians, are less sanguine about the plans. They fear it would lead to other mergers and regional monopolies. At the earlier Senate hearings, John Conyers, a senior Democrat on the House judiciary committee, said: \"We've already seen the creation of non-competitive markets in many cities ... I'm concerned that the United-US Airways merger could trigger a spate of other airline mergers.\" </p> <p>Such fears were exacerbated by takeover talks between American, Northwest, Delta and Continental after United announced its acquisition plans. </p> <p>British Airways, keen to do a deal with American, and KLM, which has an alliance with Northwest, also entered the takeover scene in June. The US and UK governments will be discussing transatlantic flights next month in London. </p> <p>United's unions scuppered the last attempt at a merger between the company and US Airways in 1995. In May this year, the Airline Pilots Association at United expressed its \"strong concerns\" about the current deal. </p> <p>Wall Street's arbitrage traders are already betting that the deal will not go ahead. Shares in US Airways were trading at about $37 yesterday, well below the $60 a share offered by United. </p> <p>United and US Airways remain confident that their deal with gain approval. </p> <p>Few analysts believe that any decision will be forthcoming before the Presidential elections, for political as well as corpporate reasons.</p>"
