  "<p>Insurance companies may be forced dramatically to increase flood insurance premiums or refuse insurance altogether because of global warming, the Assocation of British Insurers (ABI) says in a report. </p> <p>The ABI is particularly alarmed at the way developers are building on flood plains and then abandoning householders to the risk of flooding. It is urging the government to intervene to prevent this con tinuing with the 3m new homes planned in England. </p> <p>The report says: \"It is now certain that global warming is occurring. Furthermore, there is a reasonable consensus emerging that we are in for a period of much more extreme weather, resulting in more severe and more frequent floods.\" </p> <p>As flooding increases, more properties are at risk than previously thought; up to 1.2m properties already stand on the inland floodplain, about 4% of the 26m total housing stock. </p> <p>Most of the property at greatest risk lies in the Thames and Trent catchments. In London there are thought to be between 70,000 and 100,000 properties at risk, and in the Trent catchment, which includes Birmingham, Derby, Leicester and Nottingham, an estimated further 139,000. </p> <p>The total potential loss from one single severe flood could be as high as \u00a32bn, placing severe strain on the insurance industry, forcing it to rethink whether it should abandon universal insurance and substantially increase premiums for those most at risk. </p> <p>The report warns of sudden extreme events such as the incidence of thunderstorms, which cause flash floods because the volume of water overwhelms local drains, and sudden intense depressions - such as the one that has caused the flooding in Kent and Sussex. </p> <p>The worst-case scenario for the insurers is a slow moving front over the upper Thames which then gradually moves down to London. \"No other urban area in the country has anything like the potential for flood damage as the British capital. This is due to the sheer scale of the city and the fact that a significant proportion of London lies within the floodplain of the River Thames and its tributaries. </p> <p>There are about 70,000 properties in the Thames floodplain, and many thousands more which might be affected because London's drainage system is inadequate. In the insurers' estimate, up to 50,000 properties could flood in one day, at a cost of \u00a31.5bn. This compares with a total of 10,000 properties known to have flooded in the area since 1965. </p> <p>Another nightmare for the insurance companies is that closing the Thames barrier against tidal flooding might cause a backup of river water which would overflow Thames embankments. Flash floods caused by thunderstorms overwhelming the drains pose a threat to the London Underground. </p> <p>Chris Mounsey, who commissioned the report for the ABI, said: \"We are not trying to be alarmist, but as with high crime rates or subsidence, it is reasonable to increase premiums by 10%, 15% or 20% to cover the extra risk that flooding poses. </p> <p>\"Only in places where there is a habitual risk, where we would be called to pay out \u00a310,000 in compensation every couple of years, would cover be unobtainable. It would not be fair to shareholders or other premiums payers if we did otherwise.\"</p>",
  "<p>The bill for the floods which have devastated homes and businesses in southern England is likely to run into hundreds of millions of pounds, making it one of the most costly natural disasters ever to hit Britain. </p> <p>Severe flood warnings yesterday remained in force on 13 rivers in Kent and East Sussex. Paratroopers and Gurkhas were on put on standby to help as the environment agency said it could be a week before the area returns to normal. </p> <p>Maidstone was the latest casualty, with some flooding of its crown court and a leisure complex, but in many places the waters were receding and a mopping up operation was getting under way. </p> <p>Insurance firms sent staff into the areas most badly affected to begin assessing the damage and the government promised it would help local authorities pay for the clean-up. It said it was already paying for improved flood and coastal defences. </p> <p>There was growing anger, however, from some of those whose homes and livelihoods have been damaged. They said the environment agency's new flood warning system still was not up to scratch and that the government had been tardy in tackling the problem of flooding, which is becoming more common because of global climate change. </p> <p>At this stage it is impossible to gauge accurately the cost of the damage. Jeffrey Salmon, managing director of Salmon Assessors, estimated that the flooding was likely to cost insurers more than \u00a32bn - twice the cost of the great hurricane which hit the south of England in 1987. </p> <p>The British Association of Insurers offered a more conservative estimate of \u00a350m. But that figure does not take into account inestimable factors such as lost business. The government is also likely to pay out large sums of money to help local authorities. </p> <p>Elliot Morley, the countryside minister, visited the East Sussex towns of Uckfield and Lewes, which were most badly hit on Thursday. He promised that appeals from local auth orities for financial help would be dealt with as speedily as possible. </p> <p>Mr Morley said: \"We seem to be having more violent weather patterns and we accept that it could be due to global warming.\" </p> <p>Rebutting claims that not enough had been done to prevent the disaster, he said: \"The upgraded flood warning system has worked well, and so has the Floodline. People seem to have listened. No one has lost their life but there has been a terrible amount of damage.\" </p> <p>Causing most concern by yesterday afternoon was the river Medway. The 6m cubic metre Leigh Barrier reservoir was full to capacity so floodwater from the river, which would normally have been diverted into it, instead flowed through the towns of Maidstone and Tonbridge, where 300 people were evacuated. </p> <p>Firefighters rescued dozens of people who had become trapped in the village of Yalding, Kent, on the banks of the river Beult. </p> <p>One woman, Julia Black, 36, went into labour after being trapped at her home in Barcombe, East Sussex, and gave birth after being taken to hospital in a tractor and dinghy.</p>",
  "<p>BP Amoco, the British oil group, yesterday lost its position as the country's largest company. </p> <p>After the fall-out in the market on Thursday, BP had been number one. At the close yesterday BP was down 12p and Vodafone, which went up 20.75p, took over. </p> <p>BP has been jostling with Vodafone, which has recently lost out because of a volatile market and underperforming technology, media and telecom stocks. However, a BP official said: \"The future is looking bright. We are increasing production, have improved efficiency and have success in finding oil and gas.\" </p> <p>The rebranding, from the BP logo and shield to the lowercase bp and sunflower, marks the company's desire to be associated with green energy, and the shift away from oil to gas. </p> <p>Executives have also set new growth targets to expand production of 7% a year for at least three years. </p> <p>Analysts also seem to be upbeat about BP's future. Merrill Lynch said that on a long-term basis the company has a good track record, particularly in terms of cost cutting. It has undergone dramatic change since 1998 - a time of consolidation when the firm acquired Amoco and later Arco to be come a super major player. The synergies between the companies, and the knock on effects that have led to BP being able to cut costs are all positive factors according to analysts, but at the moment the company has not yet been able to convince the market that it can grow at the rate it has targeted. </p> <p>\"It is a challenging target but it is a management team you wouldn't want to bet too heavily against,\" an analyst said. However, the market remains slightly sceptical and some analysts believe it will take time, and delivery on some of the targets, before there is a change in opinion. </p> <p>The management team is strong, the environment conducive and there is a lot of residual goodwill in the UK, so buy. The shares closed yesterday at 634.5p. </p>",
  "<p>France Telecom yesterday said the \u20ac100bn (\u00a359bn) flotation of the enlarged Orange mobile phone group will take place early next year. </p> <p>The timetable for the relisting of Orange in London and Paris confounded market expectations that it would happen by the end of this year. </p> <p>Insiders said the decision to wait was simply because of the complexity of combining 15 companies, some of which are joint ventures, into one entity. </p> <p>France Telecom will also be hoping that the swing in investor sentiment against mobile phone businesses has subsided by the new year. </p> <p>The enlarged group, dubbed New Orange, will include the assets of the original company including its 8.3m strong customer base in Britain. </p> <p>It will also take in the mobile phone businesses owned by France Telecom including its domestic network Itineris and interests across mainland Europe. It will be Europe's second largest mobile phone group, with 30m subscribers. </p> <p>The marketing launch of the share issue is expected to take place in January, with the flotation likely in February. The aim is to put up to 15% of the shares in free float. </p> <p>Michel Bon, France Telecom chairman, said: \"The process of combining the mobile assets of France Telecom with Orange to create a leading global wire-free business is now well advanced.\" </p> <p>Hans Snook, Orange's chief executive, added that he was \"looking forward enormously\" to the listing of the enlarged group. </p> <p>It emerged last week that Mr Snook is to give up day-to-day running of the business to concentrate on broader issues as executive chairman of Orange. </p> <p>Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Pontal, a France Telecom director close to Mr Bon, will assume the role of chief executive.</p>",
  "George W Bush has recovered his lead in the American presidential election opinion polls in part because more voters have come to see Al Gore as a traditional liberal advocate of big government, advisers to both White House candidates believe. <p>Republican strategists urged Mr Bush to put the \"big government\" issue at the centre of his case against Mr Gore during the second presidential debate earlier this week in North Carolina. </p> <p>Mr Bush, as usual, carried out his advisers' wishes to the full. </p> <p>President Clinton is believed to be among the Democratic moderates who counselled Mr Gore to place more emphasis on the government's role as a promoter of opportunity rather than as a provider of solutions, an approach that Mr Gore tried to follow with limited success in the debate. </p> <p>While recent US campaign headlines have focused on aspects of the candidates' characters, Mr Bush's current surge has been accompanied by the emergence of strong public support for a smaller and less activist government than Mr Gore proposes. </p> <p>Results of a Washington Post survey of public opinion this week showed that Americans prefer a less interventionist government by a margin of nearly two to one, a finding which could make it very hard for Mr Gore to capture centre-ground voters, who are particularly sceptical about government activism. </p> <p>According to the Post poll, 58% of voters say that they would favour \"smaller government with fewer services\", as against 32% of Americans who prefer \"larger government with many services\". When asked which of the two candidates would do a better job \"holding down the size of government\", 54% chose Mr Bush, while only 33% chose Mr Gore. </p> <p>Mr Gore's dilemma is that almost all of the individual programmes he supports are very popular; he revived his flagging candidacy this summer by pledging to use government spending to help \"working families\" and the poor. </p> <p>Yet, as the election nears, those promises seem not to hold such attraction for the affluent minority of Americans who are expected to vote on November 7. </p> <p>\"Gore's reliance on government solutions has been very successful in rallying the Democratic base, but it does not play well with the independent voters whose support he also now needs,\" a leading Democratic moderate said this week. </p> <p>Mr Bush, who has placed a $1,300bn (\u00a3885bn) tax cut over 10 years at the centre of his programme, relentlessly painted Mr Gore as a supporter of big government during their debate. </p> <p>\"I don't believe, like the vice-president does, in huge government,\" Mr Bush said Wednesday during his closing remarks.\"I believe in limited government. And by having a limited government and a focused government we can send some of the money back to the people that pay the bills.\" </p> <p>On several occasions during the debate, Mr Gore tried to stress his credentials as a limited-government man. \"I'm for shrinking the size of government. I want a smaller and smarter government,\" he said. </p> <p>\"I'm not for command and control techniques,\" he said later in the debate. </p> <p>At times, however, Mr Gore also seemed an enthusiast for government intervention at home and abroad; responding to Mr Bush's calls for limited US foreign engagement, Mr Gore said that the US should \"provide the leadership on the environment, leadership to make sure the world economy keeps moving in the right direction\". </p> <p>And when he talked about subjects such as healthcare, hate crimes and education, Mr Gore seemed to embrace government activism very willingly. </p> <p>In 1992 and 1996, Mr Clinton successfully finessed the issue with his \"third way\" strategy, in which he reinvented the Democrats as the party of more limited government activism. </p> <p>Mr Gore has not been able to follow through on that approach in the way that hardcore moderates - such as his running mate, Senator Joseph Lieberman, and President Clinton - would normally favour. </p> <p>As he saw his support languishing throughout the first half of this year, Mr Gore was compelled to move to the left, trying to inspire traditional Democratic voters with promises of big spending programmes - especially on pensions and prescription drug benefits for the elderly - made possible by the surplus in the federal budget. </p> <p>That strategy restored Mr Gore's candidacy to health in August and for much of September. But in the past three weeks the vice-president has lost ground as Mr Bush regained it with promises of tax cuts. </p> <p>Win or lose, the issue is certain to be at the heart of the election post-mortems after November 7.</p>",
  "<p>Many of us have pored over the pages of interior magazines, dreaming of what it must be like to live inside some of the gorgeous homes in the photographs. Oh, to be in a pared-down, simplified environment, where all our belongings could be secreted away, only to be brought out when they were needed. </p> <p>Then reality kicks in, and we realise it's simply not possible. We cannot just get the kettle out of a cupboard every time we need a coffee; and while we like the variety of textures and materials available to the minimalist designer, we need more vibrant colours in our homes than variations on white and beige.</p> <p>Fortunately, the interior style popu-larly known as minimalism, which became fashionable more than a decade ago, has become more forgiving. Minimalism in 2000 allows us a more flexible environment: a balance between the freedom striven for by the philosophy and the practicalities of everyday living. We can all now have a taste of uncluttered paradise without sacrificing all homely comforts and expectations. </p> <p>The elegant work of architect Seth Stein is a good example. In one London house that Stein has designed, strong, vibrant colours are used to personalise the space. Here, with a touch of inspiration from Mexican architect Luis Barragan, a single arresting colour, offset by neutral textures, creates an electric glow that permeates through different rooms, giving a unique signature to this exquisite interior. </p> <p>But leaving aside what it looks like, this is an excellent and easy way to create a sense of space - the single colour being picked up in the next room, and so on. The light sources are unobtrusive, and provide a variety of different means of illuminating the separate parts of the house, so the overall effect is never too uniform. </p> <p>In his design for another London house, Stein has had to consider the occupier's affection for his cars - as well as the lack of outside parking. The result is a hydraulic lift in the accommodation area that enables the living space to double as storage for the car. This solution is ingenious, answering a rather demanding practical challenge. And while the mechanics that make this possible could be regarded as an unnecessary complication, the finesse with which they are executed result in a stunningly elegant, multipurpose room. </p> <p>The search for simple elegance in interior design has been a constant theme for many years. The Viennese architect Adolf Loos stated in his manifesto of 1908 that \"cultural evolution is equivalent to the removal of ornament from all articles of daily use\". Modernist hero Le Corbusier was quick to confirm this view. These aspirations were often socially motivated and of good intent, but it is extraordinarily challenging for most of us to jettison every last piece of decoration. In addition, the exacting details of minimalist designs become very expensive. For example, you cannot simply hide that awkward junction between plastered wall and floorboards with a simple piece of skirting board. Instead, you have to find and afford an expert plasterer and an extremely skilled carpenter to make sure this junction is perfectly executed. The extra time of the skilled craftsperson has to be added to the additional costs of the finest materials. </p> <p>Because the focus within the minimalist interior is often on the texture and unusual, excellent- quality materials, these materials are by definition pricey. This means that minimal style tends to be expensive and not accessible to all. Inevitably, though, as the style becomes increasingly popular, a more attainable version follows - just as haute couture is modified for high-street fashion. So the interior market strives to make interior design available for everyone. And so a more flexible, livable version of minimalism is evolving. </p> <p>Skirting boards are now acceptable, as are the odd superfluous decorative pieces - provided they are well-chosen and deliberately placed. Colours and curves are also now included. And while this dilutes the rigid minimalist ethos, it gives many more people the chance to experience the movement's ideals. </p> <p>In one apartment in New York, designed by Belmont Freeman, the amount of furniture and objects are kept at a fairly functional level, but there are some superfluous additions. Items such as vases filled with flowers only slightly encroach into the space, and yet add a slice of personalisation and beauty to an already spacious and relaxingly open room. Because of the large size of the space, each piece of furniture is carefully chosen and positioned to avoid cluttering and clashing. </p> <p>Good lighting is an essential feature for any aspect of interior design; minimalism is no exception. Gentle, diffuse lights are usually preferred, avoiding glare in the home. In houses with gardens, such as the town house pictured right, the lighting expertise is continued outside, linking indoors and outdoors. Here, the only division of the space is the large glass wall - dramatically increasing the sense of the size of the interior and heightening its feeling of flexibility. </p> <p>Gardens and adjoining exterior spaces can be utilised to great effect in expanding interiors. Of course, the larger the outside, then the more use it can be. Though not a domestic space, and smacking of unaffordable luxury, the garden of the Western Regina Hotel in California is a good example of the well-thought-out minimalist ideas. Here, the reflective quality of water is used to increase the feeling of space, while vivid colours and the confident, repetitive geometry of the concrete shapes and walls contrast with its stillness, and make for a lively scene. Meanwhile, \"windows\" in the walls offer a tantalising glimpse of unruly nature in the Baja desert beyond - infinity suggested by the unknown. </p> <p>The idea of a \"new minimalism\" does not challenge the brilliant minimalist designs of architects such as Claudio Silvestrin or John Pawson (whose interiors deservedly have an international following), but it does offer an affordable and relaxed method by which many more of us can capture some of that hypnotic, clutter-free essence.</p> <p>\u0095 Maggie Toy is editor of Architectural Design magazine.

  "Ten years' longing for a plot in which to realise my wildest gardening dreams finally came to an end late last summer when, spurred on by impending parenthood, my girlfriend Kirsten and I put an end to procrastination and moved from south London to a country cottage in East Sussex. <p>Along with the house-swap came the chance to relinquish my urban \"estate\" of two tatty window boxes and to embrace the challenge of a partially overgrown, empty and unkempt 15m x 45m rural plot. Our virgin ground, which runs alongside a lane, comprised a large, spring-fed pond at its far end, the ruins of an outbuilding and the cottage itself. A decent size, but without being too big. I was excited as to what wonders we might perform here. </p> <p>However, on my first midwinter stroll outdoors to contemplate creative wizardry and put my name in the gardening halls of fame, I became rapidly confused - the possibilities seemed so endless. All manner of ideas flared up - terraces with romantic topiary, ornamental parterres, surreal sculptures made from recycled objects - and all of them well beyond both budget and feasibility. </p> <p>With a mind full of mirages, I was getting nowhere fast and frustration was mounting, so I retreated indoors for a week or so and glared at the garden - while it glared back at me. When this standoff began to ease, I tried again, but this time with a more measured approach. With our lofty ambitions of aesthetic conquest now laid aside, we surveyed the garden afresh and began making decisions based on common sense and practicality.</p> <p> We looked at each individual area, and started to devise down-to-earth solutions that were led by the garden, rather than imposed on it. Behind the picket fence between the house and the lane, you would expect to find a typical cottage garden - all show for passers-by. Going with this theme, we decided to distil its essence into a random collection of tall herbaceous perennials: a phallic flowering frenzy. </p> <p>Over a period of a month or so, we hoarded pink and purple foxgloves, blue and yellow lupins, electric blue delphiniums, apricot foxtail lilies, red-hot pokers, burgundy pentstemons and yellow asphodelines. When we had amassed enough to pack the bed - about six plants per square metre - we laid them out and moved them around until the right combination of colourful chaos seemed most likely. And into the warming, rich, moist soil they went, hidden like dormant secrets that the coming seasons would reveal to us. </p> <p>The large pond, meanwhile, was suffering from severe clogging by a rampant South American aquatic plant, Myriophyllum aquaticum, or 'Parrot's Feather'. This is one of many risky alien species that, if left unchecked, will rapidly outgrow all native aquatic plants and fill a pond with a massed tangle of growth - overpowering not only other plants but any fish and amphibians as well. </p> <p>The only remedy in such a situation is to don waders and get physical - in my case to the tune of several hundredweight of stinking stems that I dredged from dark waters. We brought with us one item of furniture - a huge seat, nicknamed The Giant's Rest - built out of recycled timbers and rope to outsized proportions: 10ft long, with a seat high enough from the ground for even the tallest adult's feet to dangle. But where to put it in this plot with barely any open spaces? The garden itself presented us with a perfect site, backing on to a hedge between a large maple tree and a small flowering cherry - the seat nestled between the two trunks almost made to measure with inches to spare. To help integrate such a large structure with the rest of the garden, I enclosed the seat between two curving beds and planted ferns, hellebores, epimediums and Liriope muscari in its shady protection. </p> <p>We flanked it with pots of large-leaved hostas and zantedeschias to further enhance its surreal sense of scale. A rayed semicircle of slate slabs inter-planted with aromatic Corsican mint that I laid at its feet as a take-off and landing point made a decorative link with the seat's westward-facing, sunset orientation. We decided to leave a large grassy bank, bristling with nettles, between the pond and the outbuilding as a reminder of the garden's former wildness, as well as to provide a source of nettles for tea and soup, and, not least, a habitat for wildlife and insects, particularly butterflies. </p> <p>However, on the other side of this ruin, behind the house, was a spot that begged to be cultivated. Here, a 12m x 9m raised section of grass took advantage of most of the day's sun, as well as benefiting from the south-facing wall of the ruin - a perfect enclosure for an ornamental vegetable garden. </p> <p>To make up for poor, rubble-filled soil we created a patterned layout of raised beds from 15cm-wide tanalised boards with curves around a central circle formed from upended and buried bottles. We back-filled the beds with rotted manure, spent mushroom compost and topsoil to provide an instant fertile medium in which our seeds, tubers and plantlets (all ordered from the Organic Gardening Catalogue) could thrive. </p> <p>As spring progressed and all areas started to fill with foliage, our appetite for new plants continued and overflowed into 50 or so terracotta and black plastic pots - terracotta for herbs, dahlias etc; plastic tree and shrub containers for potatoes, courgettes and sunflowers. We bartered sturdy plastic fish-boxes from a fisherman and planted them with tomatoes and runner beans that soon clothed the walls in foliage. We watched as first flowers and then fruits started to appear. </p> <p>With the onset of such delights came a run-in with the local slugs that saw me become a ruthless executioner of these slimy devourers - dashing them against the paths for the birds. Luckily, I got at the aphids, too, and took perverse pleasure in rubbing them into a green mash between my fingers. </p> <p>As our first summer in the garden fades into the distance, the early days of wrangling with lofty and unsuitable ideas seem a long way away. Having arrived with a desire to conquer and impose - to show this garden a thing or two - I have learned the value of accepting the will of a raggedy plot that really only needs its surface scratched to perform wonders. </p> <p>The front garden has dazzled since spring, and is still standing firm with Verbena bonariensis (to the delight of a hummingbird hawkmoth), heleniums, asphodelines and cosmos. Our vegetable garden has yielded enough turnips, onions, garlic, chard, lettuce, carrots, etc, for us to cancel our weekly delivery of organic veg, and we are contemplating making chutneys and pickles to deal with our surplus of tomatoes and beetroot. </p> <p>The pond has space enough for the lily pads to spread, concealing a nest of moorhens, while 40-plus fish can now breathe and feed again - with just enough Parrot's Feather left (and kept in check) to help out. And the Giant's Rest is regularly crowded with the family (plus dogs) at sunset, where we plan additions and alterations for next year - with the garden's permission, of course</p> <p>\u0095 For a copy of the Organic Gardening Catalogue, call Chase Organics on 01932 253666.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Tank</strong><br>Patrick Wright <br>256pp, Faber, \u00a325 </p> <p> For over 80 years, the tank has been the mobile master of the battlefield. From its beginnings on the soggy, cratered ground of the Western Front, it has been engineered for supremacy. A protected mobile space carrying only the crew necessary to transport and serve a direct-fire weapon, its ultimate object has always been the breakthrough - achieved by killing its (ideally outclassed) opponents and then wreaking invulnerable havoc among the unprotected. The Germans ground into their Flanders trenches, the Allied tankers who faced Tigers and Panthers in the undergunned Sherman (the \"tommy-cooker\"), the Gulf War Iraqis immolated before they could fire a round - all were minnows before the sharks of the battlefield. </p> <p>Yet Patrick Wright is interested not only in the tank as instrument of warfare but also in its \"miasmic afterlife, which has lifted it from its customary motor pools and battlefields and relaunched it as a phantom of the modern imagination\". This takes him from Tiananmen protestor to agitprop art, from first-world-war propaganda to whether digitisation means a \"revolution in military affairs\". So the tank's successes at Cambrai in 1917 are followed by its use as a patriotic fund-raiser around Britain (the \"tank bank\"); the first Blitzkrieg is coupled with the unravelling of the myth of the Polish lancer versus the German panzer; Amos Oz follows swiftly on the heels of the Six Day War. Wright's style throughout is discursive, even languid, and his breadth of reference exciting. </p> <p>This approach throws up frequent gems. War Office refusals to provide a single man for initial tank trials in 1915-16 led to a tentative approach to Mrs Pankhurst to find crews of suffragettes instead (60 volunteered). And Wright's search for the truth of whether the Turkish army punishes inanimate objects conjures up a splendidly bizarre image: a tank on a hillside, surrounded by a picket fence, guarded by a sentry, parked in mechanical Coventry for the sins set out on a nearby sign. </p> <p>But more often it serves to annoy. Wright is too self-indulgent an author to know when to stop, and none of his extensive reading must go to waste. Armour prophet JFC Fuller was an early acolyte of satanist Aleister Crowley, so the pre-tank ramblings of the Great Beast get 20 pages. An eccentric artist's mobile apartment for the homeless - which even Wright admits looks more like an armoured personnel carrier than a tank - claims 10 more. As minor writer and fascist Curzio Malaparte followed tanks about the Eastern Front, we have to hear about him and his un-tanklike house on Capri. Time and again, material that merits a paragraph and a footnote gets five or 10 pages. The overall effect is of nothing so much as the lyrical transcription of material thrown up by typing \"tank\" into a shoddy net search engine. </p> <p>The space wasted on the irrelevant might have been better allocated to filling holes. An examination of the inter-war revolution in armour should focus on Nomonhan (where Zhukov practised Tukhachevsky's preachings on lightly armed Japanese), rather than Spain, as the harbinger of the operational future. And straitened interwar military establishments didn't just oppose mechanisation because (pace British Field Marshal Montgomery-Massingberd) tanks dirtied their jodhpurs. They noticed that machines were expensive, unreliable, logistically demanding and not that mobile - all of which undermined the apparently overwhelming logic for pensioning off the horse. </p> <p>These apart, Wright is better on the military aspects than many so-called military historians, in part because he writes so well. Instead, most of the holes are in his thesis on tank as \"cultural phantom\". Where is the tank and the coup, the tank and popular literature, the tank and the war film, the psychology and technology of tank-killing? Where is the tank as privatised toy, hired out by the hour on ranges around the world? Some of these get mentioned in passing, some ignored altogether; yet all have defined the cultural spectre of the tank far more than the satanic ramblings of Aleister Crowley. Most of all, where is the peace tank? The political shifts of the 1990s have produced the bizarre image of tanks denying their \"tankness\" - parked in the open, painted white, reassuring some and bluffing others, all on behalf of that miasmic entity, the international community. Nothing represents the shift in the moral environment of armour better than UNPROFOR's Danish Leopard and its female gunner, emptying every round of main gun ammunition into Serb positions to teach their recalcitrant garrison a lesson. It's the acronymic armour of peace support rather than the digital ramblings of the US Armor Center that will define the cultural phantom for the post-Desert Storm generation. </p> <p>Wright's search for the allegorical also undermines his exposition of the real. He claims that the tank was engineered out of the cultural imagination of the second decade of the 20th century. But it wasn't: it was a pragmatic product of the first-ever coincidence of shell-torn trench lines with the means (the caterpillar track) to cross them. It may have begun \"in a cloud of frantic period fantasy\", as soldiers and propagandists peddled absurd notions of the landship's power. But the fantasy has never detracted from the essence of the tank, both in function and experience: it is a weapon of war, crewed by and aimed at man. </p> <p>This is the idea that is struggling to emerge from the frantic fantasy of Wright's prose. Popular perceptions of the weapon are defined as much by representations of the people in it and facing it as by the image of the weapon itself. The key to the cultural phantom is the tank's combination of power and vulnerability. It is the power that breaks battalions; it is the vulnerability that makes them stay put, waiting for a Ganju Lama VC to destroy a tank and turn the tide. For every tank crewman knows that his comparatively comfort able ride into battle has its downside. Once the armoured shell is penetrated, the whole crew may share the same fate: minced by a HESH round, torched by white phosphorus. The better protected the tank, the less it can see; and when its vision devices are smashed, it is a cripple waiting for the coup de grace. The power of the image of the tank defied may derive from the sense of its omnipotence, but the image is so widespread because the tank is so weak. </p> <p>At the same time, the inanimate is perhaps ultra-human. Tank crews (and those of other armoured vehicles) live more closely than any servicemen save submariners. Three to five men may spend 20 hours a day boxed up in a small compartment, relying entirely on each other's skills for survival. This proximity builds bonds strong even by the standards of a close-knit profession. The power of the tank also rests on human shoulders. As Wright himself points out, the Tiananmen protestor only stopped a column of PLA armour because the driver of the lead tank chose not to roll over him. The size and vulnerability of the weapon may simply serve to magnify the humanity of those who wield it. </p> <p>This is a message that will not go away. The tank is as vulnerable, and as human, as ever. Grozny, New Year 1994-5: lost, unsupported Russian tanks are hunted down by packs of Chechens with rocket-propelled grenades and turf knowledge. Southern Lebanon, 2000: the safest tank in the world, the Israeli Merkava, falls to Hizbollah's TOW missiles. Both were images that shaped policy. The tank's symbolic resonance is a function of the humanity of those who create, serve and are killed by it. Perhaps if Wright had ignored the whimsical siren of second-rate artists and stuck with the squeal of sprockets, Tank wouldn't have read like a missed opportunity.</p>",
  "<p>Technology stocks took fright yet again this week, but this time it wasn't just dot.coms but the telecom stocks that make up the major holdings of many technology funds. </p> <p>Motorola sent shockwaves through the market with a warning that worldwide growth in demand for mobile phones has slowed.</p> <p>It predicts that handset sales will be around 410m-425m this year, compared to earlier forecasts of up to 450m. Its shares promptly fell 19%. The fall-out from the Motorola announcement soon hit other telecom stocks, with Ericsson and Nokia, Europe's biggest manufacturers of mobile phones, seeing their shares slide 6%. Other telecoms equipment manufacturers also saw their shares go into freefall.</p> <p>But the major technology funds say they have yet to suffer a wave of selling, despite sagging performance. A survey this week from fund analysts Lipper showed that all but one of the 26 technology funds in the UK saw their returns fall during September. It said that the average drop during the month was 7.49%.</p> <p>However, there are signs the fashion for technology funds is fading. In August sales of technology funds were \u00a3104m, a fraction of the \u00a3701m peak in March, when the dot.com boom coincided with the traditional end-of-tax year rush into Isas.</p> <p>But global marketing director Steve Lipper believes investors should not be overly concerned. He says: \"This is a volatile market and these ups and downs are to be expected. The message stays the same - this is a potentially rewarding sector but expect a bumpy ride on the way.\"</p>",
  "<p>Lloyds TSB was accused this week of abandoning one of the most deprived parts of the West Midlands, despite making a pledge that it would never be the last bank to leave an area. </p> <p>Local residents and traders in the Bell Green district of Coventry reacted angrily to the news that the local Lloyds TSB branch had shut without notice leaving them, in some cases, to travel several miles to the nearest bank branch. </p> <p>The bank says a series of armed raids on the branch had left staff \"traumatised\" and it could not guarantee their safety if the branch had re-opened. Three raids on the branch had taken place in the last four months and five in the last year. CCTV cameras were installed inside the branch and outside in the Riley Square shopping centre, but had failed to act as a deterrent or gain a conviction. </p> <p>A spokeswoman for the bank says the decision was made in the interests of branch staff. \"It is never a decision we take lightly, but in this instance the safety of our staff was paramount.\" </p> <p>The Bell Green branch in the north of the city serves four large housing estates. Residents say they make up the most deprived section of Coventry. </p> <p>An application for regeneration funding under the gov ernment's New Deal for Communities initiative is currently being put together that should bring \u00a350m to the estates for a range of employment, welfare and education projects. </p> <p>Nerissa Jones, a local vicar and head of the partnership board preparing the funding bid, says that the decision to close the Lloyds TSB branch could end any hope of regenerating the area. </p> <p>\"It is a very serious predicament, not just for local shops and traders that use the bank's facilities, but the whole community. One of my parishioners, an elderly and infirm lady, needed to spend \u00a313.50 on taxis to get to a branch. She can't use buses. She can't walk that far. It was all she could do. Most people with children, the elderly and many other groups will need to get a bus, which costs a lot.\" </p> <p>She scoffs at the notice sent out by the bank encouraging customers to use its telephone banking and internet facilities. She says many people on the estates can't afford phones, let alone afford extra bills from phoning their bank. She says few people in her congregation have computers connected to the internet. </p> <p>\"Residents have every sympathy with the bank's staff. In fact, we think they have been very hard done by. They don't seem to have been given much protection by the bank. But closing the branch has placed a heavy burden on the local community.\" </p> <p>Ms Jones says a \u00a3100,000 CCTV system covering the whole shopping centre is about to be installed by the city council and a new police station is soon to be located near the branch. \"Why shut down when the first steps of regeneration are going ahead?\" </p> <p>Lloyds TSB director Dennis Holt refutes claims that the bank was the last to quit the area - a pledge made last year to MPs on the Treasury Select Committee. He says five other branches are located \"nearby\". Two further branches can be found in the city centre. He says there are several post offices that customers can use for cashing cheques and withdrawing money. There is also a Coventry Building Society branch near to the closed branch. </p> <p>\"Bell Green by any definition is a suburb of a much larger community. We believe we are still well represented in that community,\" says Mr Holt. </p> <p>The Lloyds TSB spokeswoman adds that security was not the only issue discussed by Lloyds managers before closure plans were sealed. She says use of the branch by the local community had been declining for several years. Her comments were echoed by branch director Ian Sparks, who oversees several branches in the city. He reportedly told a Coventry radio talk show this week that a drop in trade had been a factor in the decision to close the branch. </p> <p>Ms Jones says the admission that branch revenues were a significant factor reveal Lloyds social reponsibility claims to be a sham. And she rejects the idea that Lloyds is leaving behind a supportive infrastructure. The local post office is small, combined with a shop and already suffers from long queues. Traders need the banking facilities provided by a clearing bank rather than a post office or building society, she argues. </p> <p>Lloyds' decision to pull out of Bell Green is also a blow to the government, which depends on large employers that provide key services remaining in deprived areas. A spokeswoman for the Treasury said the partnership board could ask for cash for individual projects before full approval for the bid is finalised. </p> <p>\"We encourage areas to submit early projects for approval so they can get going. There is money available for projects like after school clubs, graffitti blitzes and credit unions, which might suit this situation.\" But she said there was nothing the government could do to stop a branch closure.</p>",
  "<p>It would be easy to look at what happened to England in Finland and moan about bad luck, bad refereeing and how football has a nasty habit of kicking you when you are down. Forget the lot of it. </p> <p>Every struggling side will insist they have been decimated by injuries or are not getting the breaks. But excuses and self-pity are a waste of time. The bottom line is that teams win matches, titles or qualify for tournaments because they deserve to. </p> <p>In any case, these things cut both ways. Yes, you can look at the Ray Parlour \"goal\" or the foul on Teddy Sheringham and wonder what might have been. But then what about the Euro 2000 qualifier against Sweden at Wembley when Paul Scholes could have been sent off in the first minute? </p> <p>I tried never to go down that road of \"if only\". It gives the players a get-out-of-jail card and I don't think you should ever do that. If you look back you'll find I made very few after-match comments about referees. </p> <p>That is where Martin O'Neill did so well last season when there was all that boardroom trouble at Leicester. It would have been easy for him or the players to lose focus and say \"How do you expect us to pull together?\" But Martin used events off the field to bring his team even closer. </p> <p>That mentality of taking responsibility is important. I tried to convey to my players that what we do is decisive; that, if we do it right enough times, we will win and, if we don't, it is our fault and nobody else's. </p> <p>Of course there are times when someone scores with a deflection against you and you think \"I don't need that\". But, when the ball runs for you, you don't tend to turn round and say \"We were jammy there,\" do you? And the incidents you moan about when you are down you generally shrug off when you're flying. </p> <p>That's why I love players who are strong-minded and don't think in terms of hard-luck stories. Paul McGrath and Mark Hughes were like that. Martin Keown, who I think has emerged as England's best defender, also has that quality in abundance. That mental strength is something you see in all top sports people, be it Steve Redgrave or Tiger Woods. </p> <p>In any case, it's by no means curtains for England's hopes of reaching the 2002 World Cup. I expected us to have four points by now and, if we had beaten Germany, people might have said it was quite a professional performance to go to Finland and get a point on a poor pitch in windy conditions. </p> <p>Instead we went there looking down the barrel and that changes the perception. I know the performance was far from brilliant but there are enough games to rectify the situation and the break until Finland visit Anfield in March offers a chance to bring in a new coach and create a feeling that we are starting the campaign again. </p> <p>As Howard Wilkinson said, England may not be good enough to win the World Cup but we are a lot better than we have looked in recent competitive matches. And I think playing at league grounds while Wembley is rebuilt could work in our favour. </p> <p>Foreign teams definitely get a lift from coming to Wembley. Whatever anyone says, it was the Cathedral of Football and sides felt it was a privilege to play there. I remember being on the pitch before the Arsenal-Fiorentina Champions League game there last season. Gabriel Batistuta, Paulo Sousa and others were looking around clearly thinking, \"This looks the business, we'll have a bit of this.\" And of course Fiorentina went on to win that match. </p> <p>League grounds are an environment our players are more familiar with and that might bring performances which are less inhibited. Also the fans can provide extra adrenalin in those tighter stadiums. </p> <p>Kevin Keegan wanted to play international matches at Newcastle United and I can understand that. You are guaranteed not only a big crowd at St James' Park but a very fervent one. </p> <p>But finding the right man to replace Keegan is still the No1 issue. I wonder whether the most suitable candidate might be Sven-Goran Eriksson, the Lazio coach. He's got a northern European mentality but has spent a lot of time in Mediterranean Europe, speaks good English and knows our game well. </p> <p>I wouldn't leave Lazio if I were him but he'll know that in Italy you are always on shaky ground. You can be top of the league, have a bad team photo and be sacked. And, if Eriksson wanted to stay to the end of the season, to try to win another Serie A title and the Champions League, and then take over the England job it would be worth the wait. Let's face it, we have hit a rocky patch and bad luck is not the reason. </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

  "<p>Another day, another desperate downward plunge for Marks &amp; Spencer shares. Last night the price closed at 171p, equal to the once-proud store chain's net asset value. In other words, in the eyes of the market Marks &amp; Spencer's 11% share of the clothing market is now worth absolutely zero. </p> <p>In the last two weeks the share price decline has gathered momentum. The shares have fallen nearly 25%, wiping \u00a31.6bn off the value of the company. </p> <p>The latest damage has been inflicted by a series of broker downgrades, culminating in one influential analyst suggesting that 165p was a more appropriate target price, and a few paragraphs hidden away in the small print of the competition commission's supermarkets report which revealed that M&amp;S's food profits took a hammering between 1996 and 1999. </p> <p>The Baker Street mob have always chosen not to divulge the bottom line performance of their foodhalls, but the consensus of opinion had always been that it was performing well, compared with the rest of the business. </p> <p>M&amp;S insist that the figures were distorted, unrepresentative, etc, on the grounds of extra costs associated with this, that and the other. But no one is listening to the flannel any more. </p> <p>The sad truth is that M&amp;S is unlikely to ever be returned to its previous pole position in British retailing, no matter what wheezes the company can come up with (and they would have to be a lot better than the uninspired bare-bottom ad campaign and its dreary Exclusively for Everyone slogan). </p> <p>The science of shopping has changed. No one would now invent a store that sells lingerie alongside lentil soup. </p> <p>The Great British shopper does not want vast stores full of endless racks of clothes, unless they come cheap in a discount warehouse. Our love affair with labels does not extend to the rather dull little white one in the back of M&amp;S clothes. </p> <p>The group needs surgery to prune back its store numbers - probably making many loyal staff redundant. But that is a bitter pill and M&amp;S will probably only do half the job. Certainly there is still no sign of its new retail chief Roger Holmes beaming down to do the dirty deeds required. </p> <p>Terminal decline beckons, and there is no reason why M&amp;S shares should not slide even further south. Certainly, the heat-seeking value investment funds are showing no sign of locking on to M&amp;S. </p> <p>Plenty of stores trade at a discount to their net asset value - take House of Fraser shares, which change hands at about 50% of NAV. If Marks &amp; Spencer traded on the same price/earnings ratio as Boots its shares would be just 120p. </p> <p>And there is no reason to think that at some stage a bidder is bound to emerge. There hasn't been one for Arcadia, or Boots, or Oasis - and they are all much cheaper than M&amp;S. </p> <p><strong> Not floating </strong><br> </p> <p> Spare a moment, if you will, for those in the Square Mile counting on big bonus payments this year. </p> <p>Behind the headlines of spiking oil prices and billions wiped on and off shares, there is a growing realisation that, whatever the macro-economic consequences of tension in the middle east, the damage may already have been done to many of the huge, fee-earning deals coming down the market slipway. </p> <p>Jessops, the photographic chain, has already iced its flotation plans, having found that fund managers would rather keep their hands in their pockets for now. Other relatively small new issues insist they are battling onwards to market. But they should not be surprised if they find themselves facing a universally hostile reception in the City - any new company insistent on joining the quoted sector during a period of extreme uncertainty is automatically treated with high suspicion. They just look too desperate. </p> <p>Of much more importance to the British market are issues such as Orange, due to be spun off by France Telecom, and Yell.com, ready to pop out of British Telecom. The big telcos are des perate to offload businesses as one way of reducing debt built up in the great race to be part of the next generation of mobile telephony. </p> <p>Even if the window has not shut entirely after this week's market gyrations, there seems no real chance of achieving the ratings which were being assumed so casually, so recently. </p> <p>And then there is Sky Global Networks, Rupert Murdoch's planned satellite holding company which will bring together his 37.5% stake in BSkyB and Asia's Star TV, along with interests in Italy, Latin America and Japan. </p> <p>It has been billed as the biggest initial public offering of a media company - ever. And it promises a bonanza for every financial adviser involved, on both sides of the Atlantic - if it happens. </p> <p>But the market is no longer so sure. Over the past week, shares in parent News Corporation have fallen by almost a quarter. It feels like a chilly autumn.</p>",
  "<p>Insurers were today facing a multi-billion-pound payout as the worst floods to hit south-east England for decades finally began to recede. </p> <p>Dozens of homes and businesses across the region have been left devastated - and insurers fear the floods may turn out to be the UK's costliest natural disaster. </p> <p>Jeffrey Salmon, managing director of Salmon Assessors, said it was likely to cost insurers more than \u00a32bn, more than double the cost of the hurricane that hit the same region in 1987. </p> <p>The flooding in Kent and East Sussex led to hundreds of people being evacuated from their homes and dozens of rescues by emergency services. </p> <p>Daybreak brought a glimmer of hope this morning for thousands of people whose homes and businesses were inundated. After a dry night, rivers which yesterday overflowed were beginning to recede. </p> <p>The lower levels of the ancient castle town of Lewes, East Sussex, still resembled a huge lake, but the watermark on buildings showed that the floodwaters had fallen by at least 18ins. </p> <p>People in Maidstone, Tonbridge and Yalding and were still on alert as high tides were due this afternoon on rivers in the area. </p> <p>The Environment Agency said the south-east of England had two and a half times the normal monthly rainfall for October falling by yesterday evening. </p> <p>Kent fire brigade said it received more than 390 calls for help during the last 24 hours. </p> <p>Up to 200 soldiers are on standby to assist the emergency services in the event of further flooding. </p> <p>Firefighters today rescued a married couple and their 73-year-old neighbour after a river flooded their homes.

The couple then returned with firefighters and paramedics to save their neighbour, Cecil Robins. </p> <p>Mrs Shave said: \"The water started coming in at 3am, first in the kitchen and then in the lounge. We moved what we could upstairs, but then the water started rising up the stairs. We were trapped upstairs with the water level still rising. We were going to try to wade out for help, but we were terrified we would be swept away.</p> <p>\"There is about 4ft of water on the ground floor and the sofa is floating around my front room The emergency services said we might be able to get back to our home on Monday.\"</p>",

  "<p>On Monday the AA announced its chef of the decade, based on a poll of 1,800 chefs. It came as no great surprise to anyone that it was Marco Pierre White, quondam enfant terrible of the kitchen, terror of the dining room, flayer of critics, who officially retired from the stoves last year to concentrate on building up his chain of restaurants and his already considerable wealth. </p> <p>The truth is that the real chef of the past decade, indeed of the century, died in 1935. His name was Auguste Escoffier. Escoffier transformed the place of the chef in the restaurant hierarchy, the working conditions for all kitchen staff, formalised the way in which kitchens worked, established the kitchen hierarchy and the place of the chef within it, and laid down the basis for much of what passes for modern cooking. </p> <p>There is scarcely a chef worth his salt who hasn't turned to Escoffier's La Guide Culinaire in their hour of need (and there are a great many chefs whose salt would be greatly improved if they did). Escoffier's groundwork prepared the way for the celebrity chef of today, and there is no chef in the UK who has greater celebrity than Marco Pierre White. (There is a distinction between being a celebrity and merely being famous, like Jamie Oliver or Gary Rhodes.) However, celebrity does not necessarily equate to importance or influence. </p> <p>If you study the menus in any of the restaurants in which Marco Pierre White has an interest, you will find a homage to classical French cooking. It may be titivated, reworked, reorganised, relabelled, but the origins are unmistakable. It is the French food that earlier generations fell in love with, told us about, and which we came to expect when we first went to France. This is one aspect of Marco's talent - he has an instinctive understanding of the kind of food many people like to eat and of the environment in which they like to eat it. </p> <p>That is why Granada, with whom he has a close business involvement, have asked him to bring his skills to bear on what has hitherto been one of the most distinctive, and direst, of British eating experiences, the food in old Trust House hotels. </p> <p>But you don't look to a Marco menu for the influences of Italian, Indian, Japanese, Chinese or fusion cooking. His food is rooted firmly in the past. Even when he was at the height of his cooking powers, when he made Harvey's in Wandsworth a place of pilgrimage, his food was French in all essentials. In spite of the much publicised fact that he has never been to France, he showed an uncanny awareness of the latest dishes and developments in the great kitchens there. </p> <p>This is not to diminish his brilliance. He has won his Michelin stars. He was, at the time, the youngest chef ever to be awarded three of them. He was probably the greatest kitchen technician this country has ever seen. He understood how to create great sauces, cook meat or fish precisely, to assemble dishes so that each part of them was perfect, like an engineer understands stress or a chemist the reaction between various chemicals. He can impart this knowledge to the large number of chefs he now has working for him, and this is why his restaurants, by and large, turn out food to an astonishing level of consistency and excellence. But does that make him the chef of the decade? Has he really changed the way in which we eat or think about food? Has he done more for us than other contenders such as Pierre Koffman, Raymond Blanc or even Nico Ladenis? </p> <p>Pierre Koffman is the hero of most chefs in the industry. He published two remarkable books, Memories of Gascony and La Tante Claire, and these have been his sole contributions to the media factory. In the celebrity stakes, Pierre Koffman hasn't even made it to the starting line. Not for Koffman, Ready, Steady, Cook, chatshow appearances or gossip columns. </p> <p>Koffman keeps to his kitchen. Mr Koffman cooks. As a professional and as a creative chef, Koffman is an exemplar, but his very reticence probably disqualifies him from the accolade. </p> <p>Nico Ladenis was, until his retirement from the kitchen last year, the most individual figure, as famous for his abuse of customers and the media as he was for the exquisite passion of his cooking. But his stance, at the height of his powers, was unashamedly elitist. He never became part of the culinary establishment. He eschewed the pulpit that TV or the press might have offered him, and so he had less impact he might otherwise have had. </p> <p>Raymond Blanc is another matter. No one can accuse Raymond Blanc of being a shrinking violet. Books have poured from him. He has charmed from the pulpit of TV. He demonstrates, instructs, talks, broadcasts and, of course, cooks. His is a naturally restless nature, and a curious one, too. He has had a Japanese period. He has dabbled in Indian spicing. He has sought to harness techniques from other culinary cultures and explore technology. He has been a fervent spokesman on behalf of organic food, and has practised what he preached in the gardens of Le Manoir aux Quat' Saisons. He has reinvented his cooking at regular intervals, not always to good effect it has to be said, but he always returns to his French roots. M\u00e8re Blanc is never far away from her son's culinary invention. This inventive energy has been as marked during the last 10 years as it was during his first 10. </p> <p>Perhaps most importantly he has been a great missionary for good food outside his own restaurant. The Le Petit Blanc chain of brasserie-effect eateries, which he is rolling out across the country with the backing of the Virgin Group, is making a contribution to the quality of eating out at the democratic end of the market. </p> <p>And, of course, he has also been a phenomenal teacher of chefs. Paul Heathcote, Richard Neat, Bruno Loubet, Aaron Paterson, Michael Caines, John Burton-Race, Michael Wormersly, not to mention MPW himself, have all passed through his kitchens. All these chefs have gone on to run Michelin-starred kitchens of their own. </p> <p>However, there is little generic similarity between their cooking styles. Raymond Blanc seems to have the gift of inspiring and instilling principles in his chefs without forcing them to conform to a Blancian template. In this he differs greatly from Marco. It isn't that the chefs who have passed through Marco's kitchens lack creativity, but the style of food they go on to produce is very much in the master's image. None the worse for that, you may say, given the excellence of the master. True, but it doesn't take cooking in this country any further forward. It immures it in history. It takes its principles from an outmoded past. It's as if painting or architecture still subscribed to the taste of classical Greece or Rome. </p> <p>Marco bestrode the London restaurant scene like a colossus in the 90s. He embodied the zeitgeist of the capital's gastronomic aspirations. Nothing he said or did was ever less than interesting. He was the source of immense excitement. He cooked and he made money, and he knew when to stop. </p> <p>The notion of a chef of the decade is, frankly, risible, but if you had to choose one it would be as well to remember that London doesn't represent the rest of Britain, and French cooking is not the future or even the present of food in this country.</p>",

  "<p>Arena Leisure has joined forces with BSkyB and Channel 4 to bid for the media rights to Britain's 59 racecourses. The joint-venture, named NewCo, will make its offer within the next fortnight, a move which signals Channel 4's return to negotiations following its withdrawal of a \u00a3225m bid in July. </p> <p>Ian Penrose, spokesman for Arena whose \u00a3320m bid, made in September, lapsed on Tuesday, said: \"Our partnership with Channel 4 and BSkyB combines all the necessary expertise to develop UK racing as a truly global media and gaming product. </p> <p>\"We sincerely hope the racecourses will appreciate that this partnership is best placed to maximise enhanced revenue streams to racing.\" </p> <p>Arena's previous bid was surpassed by a \u00a3400m offer over a 10-year period from media group Carlton, who have set a deadline of October 24 for beginning a period of exclusivity. NewCo are obviously in a position to better the Carlton bid by some way. </p> <p>Stephen Atkin, chief executive of the Racecourse Association, welcomed the new development. \"We look forward with interest to receiving their offer,\" he said. \"We have been attempting to broker a 59-racecourse solution since the end of July and a great deal of work has been done.\" </p> <p>Channel 4's proposed 10-year-deal, involving ntl subsidiary Premium TV and the BBC involving the \"Super 12\" racecourses, collapsed largely in the face of opposition from the remaining 47 tracks. </p> <p>BSkyB had also been involved in negotiations with the Super 12 but pulled out in February. However, a spokesman for Channel 4 said: \"I think there is a feeling that there is more common ground between the racecourses as a whole. It is not yet plain sailing, but the situation has moved on.\" </p> <p>A spokesman for the BBC, who are not so far included in the new deal, said: \"We still have a commitment to racing and are following the situation closely.\" </p> <p>Aidan O'Brien will run Minardi, Mozart, Cashel Palace and Freud in tomorrow's Darley Dewhurst Stakes for which 11 have been declared. Speaking at Newmarket yesterday, he said: \"Mick Kinane will tell me which one he wants to ride and I'll leave it to him, I shan't be advising him.\" </p> <p>O'Brien works Giant's Causeway on the all-weather surface at Southwell this afternoon to try and gauge whether the colt should be aimed at the Breeders' Cup Classic on the dirt or the Mile on turf at Churchill Downs next month. \"He'll gallop over a mile or maybe nine furlongs with Shoal Creek and one other and we'll see how he goes,\" explained the trainer. \"He's bred to go on the dirt but you never know.\" </p> <p>O'Brien's Ishiguru started hot-favourite to score first time out in the Snailwell Maiden Stakes yesterday but after leading a furlong out was caught in the last few strides by the more experienced Ajwaa, trained by Marcus Tregoning. </p> <p>Ishiguru is a powerful, sprinting son of Danzig and this defeat should prove only a minor setback particularly when he gets some fast ground. </p> <p>Members of the syndicates run by Peter Harris have been enjoying a great run this autumn and the Tring trainer landed a double with Katy Nowaitee and Idle Power. </p> <p>Katy Nowaitee, owned by The Stable Maites, followed up her win in the Cambridgeshire in the Listed Grangewood Severals Stakes and will stay in training next season although she could have one more run in a Group 3 race at Bordeaux. </p> <p>Idle Power is owned by a 12-strong syndicate called The Dreamers who were understandably overjoyed with their 20-1 winner.

  "<p>The pupils of Uckfield community college were enjoying the applause for their performance of the musical Captain Noah and His Floating Zoo - which features the song \"Let it rain, let it rain\" - when the heavens opened. </p> <p>By yesterday morning five inches of rain had fallen in 12 hours and their picturesque town in East Sussex was waist deep in muddy floodwater and sewage. </p> <p>All day long emergency workers rescued men, women and children from the torrent. The people of Uckfield had been awoken by the frightening sounds of breaking glass and rushing water as the River Uck burst its banks and flooded the town. </p> <p>Residents were plucked from the first floors of their houses by lifeboatmen working in unfamiliar territory, 15 miles inland. A supermarket's windows were burst open by the force of millions gallons of water, and soggy produce floated away. </p> <p>Yet people still tried to get into work. A local jeweller was swept off his feet by the current as he tried to open his shop on the high street at 7.20am. Vernon Jay was winched out of the water half a mile away by a helicopter. </p> <p>A neighbour, Darren Marshall-Dean, said: \"I looked out of my window and could see Vernon being sucked down the high street in the torrent. He didn't even have a chance to scream, the water was so fierce.\" He was found clinging to a shop front half a mile away and was eventually pulled from the water. </p> <p>As the worst floods locals could remember rose across tranches of southern England, many areas were cut off. Car and lorry drivers had to abandon their cars, or sit on their roofs and await rescue. In the car park of Etchingham railway station, near Hastings, vehicles began to float and crunch into one another. Roads were blocked and railway lines impassable. </p> <p>In Lewes, continuing torrential rain combined with high tides meant that many homes had to be evacuated. Emergency services were stretched to breaking point as staff fled fire and ambulance control rooms as the water flooded in. </p> <p>Council staff drove around with a loud-hailer to warn residents in low-lying areas to leave their homes and meet at the town hall or at a leisure centre on higher ground. By yesterday afternoon hundreds of homes were underwater. </p> <p>Those who had gathered in safety watched as beer barrels floated outside Harvey's brewery, which was under more than 20ft of water. Nineteen workers were plucked from the brewery roof. </p> <p>The cost of the damage will run into the millions, prompting many to ask why more is not being done to protect their homes from the floodwaters. The Environment Agency and weather forecasters repeated their warning that global warming is likely to make serious floods more common in the coming years. </p> <p>The Environment Agency launched a new flood warning system only a few weeks ago. It has done away with the old system of classifying floods as yellow, amber or red. Now it has introduced what it believes is a clearer system and is spending \u00a32m on a campaign to raise awareness of the dangers of flooding. </p> <p>By 3pm yesterday it had issued \"severe flood warnings\", indicating that there was imminent danger to life and property on 10 rivers in East Sussex and Kent. There were also 47 \"flood warnings\" and \"flood watches\" on 92 rivers across England and Wales from the Isle of Wight to Yorkshire. </p> <p>Archie Robertson, director of operations of the Environment Agency, said the amount of rain which had fallen in some places was \"unheard of\". </p> <p>But, of course, there was nothing they could do to stop the rain. The government agency said that in the past 72 hours northwest Kent and East Sussex had seen 180mm (7ins) of rain. Some 130mm (5ins) had fallen in just 12 hours. </p> <p>Five lifeboat crews were escorted into the area by police. One crew rescued six children who were swept away while playing near the railway line. Others rescued a group of 20 men, women and children from the Somerfield supermarket in Uckfield, and from flats above the high street. The supermarket's windows caved in under the pressure of the water and stock floated off down the street. Children grabbed footballs, dolls and boxes of chocolates. Some adults could not resist either. One young man wading through the water with a trolley of goods was stopped by a policeman who used a JCB to reach him. </p> <p>The town's mayor, Mike Skinner, said: \"Our entire industrial estate of about 400 businesses has been flooded out, as well as around 30 shops in the town centre. There is flotsam and jetsam everywhere.\" </p> <p>Six members of a lifeboat crew had a narrow escape when their boat was dragged underneath a bridge in Lewes which had been almost submerged by water. The men leapt on to the walkway over the River Ouse seconds before their dinghy, battered by strong currents, vanished. One toppled into the water and had to be plucked to safety by his colleagues. </p> <p>East Sussex Fire Brigade control room was evacuated after a newly built retaining wall alongside River Ouse collapsed. The ambulance service had to send emergency mobile control vehicles to high ground to operate an emergency satellite radio and 999 control. </p> <p>The emergency services were stretched to breaking point. Every available fire crew in East Sussex was this morning pumping flood water from properties while Environment Agency workers tried to keep swollen rivers flowing. </p> <p>The AA was dealing with 500 calls an hour in the region, with some drivers saying they could not find their cars in the floods. </p> <p>The M20 and M2 in Kent were badly hit. Many smaller roads were impassable. The water turned part of the M25 into a skidpan and there was a string of minor accidents. </p> <p>Thousands of commuters could not get into work. Rail services into London were affected and the Balcombe rail tunnel in Sussex was flooded, preventing any electric trains from passing. </p> <p>Met Office forecasters warned there was more rain to come in southeast England but with easing on Friday. </p> <p>However, the relief is likely to be short-lived. </p> <p>The director of the Met Office's Hadley Centre for Climate Research, Alan Thorpe, said current research showed Britain will have wetter winters and, in northern areas, slightly wetter summers. \"The number of days of very heavy rain could increase substantially, so the risk of flooding is likely to increase,\" he said. </p> <p>\u0095 <strong>Past deluges</strong></p> <p><strong>1953</strong> Storm and high seas combined with heavy rain saturated the east coast of England, and 307 people died. Over \u00a330m damage was caused after severe flooding swamped roads, and the pier at Skegness was destroyed. </p> <p><strong>1960</strong> Floods in the south west, south Wales and south west midlands blocked many main roads. Two people drowned and hundreds of houses were flooded. The rivers Taw, Avon and Wye reached six metres above normal level. </p> <p><strong>1968</strong> Eighteen people died and 3,000 houses, shops and other properties were flooded and damaged across the country. Worst affected areas were in Bristol, Somerset and Devon. Bridges collapsed and roads were destroyed. </p> <p><strong>1978</strong> East Anglia and the east coast were lashed by gales and flood tides. The rivers Ouse and Nene flooded over 1,000 houses. In Wisbech a woman drowned in her own home. </p> <p><strong>1990</strong> Sea defences were breached by storms and high tides. More than 1,000 people were evacutated from Towyn in north Wales and parts of the south west. Of 3,000 properties flooded, 40% were without contents insurance. </p> <p><strong>1992</strong> Following the wettest November for 22 years - 50% above average - parts of south Wales and Somerset were severely flooded. Four inches of rain fell in 12 hours, the river Taff burst its banks and buildings were damaged in Pontypridd and Cardiff.</p>",
  "<p>RJB Mining, Britain's biggest coal producer, hit an intractable wall of resistance on Wednesday when it called off takeover talks with Renco, the US conglomerate: its shares lost 27% of their value, ending the day at 46.5p, making the group run by Richard Budge worth just \u00a367m. </p> <p>Just four years ago they hit a peak of 625p, valuing RJB at just under \u00a3900m, after the government initiated a series of measures, including a ban on new gas-fired power stations, to preserve coal's role in the nation's energy mix. </p> <p>Ministers are now waiting for European Commission approval of a new \u00a3100m aid package for the coal industry designed to keep pits open. RJB stands to benefit by \u00a370m after waving the stick of closures and job losses among its 8,000-strong mining workforce. </p> <p>So, is the group worth backing as it goes it alone? Yesterday the shares staged a sort of comeback, gaining at various stages 10% before closing up 4p at 51p. That came on the back of a note from brokers Williams de Broe uprating the stock from hold to buy and a series of analysts' comments that the shares are cheap. </p> <p>But there are no obvious alternative suitors to Renco which had been examining RJB for six months and failed to come up with an offer expected to be worth between \u00a3110m and \u00a3130m. RJB, on the other hand, has some cogent reasons of its own for encouraging support as an independent group. </p> <p>It points to plans to sell off parts of its extensive property portfolio or land bank, worth up to \u00a375m, and return cash to shareholders. More importantly, it is selling more coal than it produces: 12m tonnes in the first half when it made a \u00a310.2m pre-tax loss. And prices have risen some 20%. </p> <p>Pat Carrogher, leader of the colliery managers' union, says there is more upside in the form of hardening oil prices and, since the petrol crisis, a continuing role for coal in the national fuel mix. His hunches are right and investors should back them. </p>",

  "The world's largest tobacco company, Philip Morris, admitted for the first time yesterday that cigarettes are addictive and harmful, during public hearings in Geneva in the run-up to a global treaty on tobacco control. <p>Until yesterday, despite scientific evidence and internal industry documents that have been revealed in litigation in the United States, tobacco companies have refused to acknowledge that vast numbers of people are hooked on nicotine. The companies always claimed that people smoke out of choice. </p> <p>\"We agree that smoking is addictive and causes disease in smokers,\" announced David Davies, Philip Morris Europe's vice president for corporate affairs, at a news conference. \"Today I affirm we are in step with public health authorities.\" </p> <p>His historic admission was dismissed by anti-tobacco compaigners as a clever piece of footwork by the industry, which is trying to win inclusion in the World Health Organisation's negotiations on a global tobacco treaty which begin on Monday. Campaigners believe the tobacco industry would attempt to water down the treaty and would drag out negotiations if its representatives are included in the discussions. </p> <p>Mr Davies' position yesterday was that, however addictive and damaging cigarettes are, the public have a right to smoke if they want to. Public health campaigners will argue that this stance is illogical and that someone who is addicted is stripped of choice in the matter. </p> <p>Philip Morris supported \"sensible\" regulation of tobacco products and their sales, marketing and advertising, said Mr Davies, but opposed \"any proposal which would constitute a prohibition on the ability of companies like ours to make cigarettes and the ability of informed adults to choose to use cigarettes\". </p> <p>It opposed uniform global tax rates and called for countries to outlaw the sales and marketing of cigarettes to under 18s - a measure which health campaigners say is totally ineffective in preventing children from starting to smoke. </p> <p>Mr Davies promised the company would share its own research with WHO scientists and take steps to combat smuggling. There was laughter from the audience when Mr Davies said Philip Morris regretted a decision last week by the European court to throw out legislation that would have banned almost all tobacco advertising and sponsorship in the EU by 2006. </p> <p>Matthew Myers, president of the US-based non-governmental organisation Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, dismissed the remarks as \"an insidious effort by Philip Morris to prevent strong government regulation\". </p> <p>Tobacco companies and public health groups have come face to face for two days of public hearings on tobacco control, which was the WHO's answer to the demands of the industry to be included in negotiations on the framework convention on tobacco control. Over 500 submissions came in from all over the world and have been posted on a dedicated website. </p> <p>In spite of enthusiasm for the treaty from the public health community, it will not be easy to get agreement on specifics. Tobacco growing employs many people in the developing world and cigarettes are a big source of tax revenue for governments. The WHO wants its 191 member states to agree on international duties on cigarettes, a clampdown on smuggling, a total ban on advertising, the outlawing of public smoking worldwide and support for farmers who stop tobacco farming. </p> <p>British American Tobacco, the other tobacco giant, backed national action to stop minors from smoking. But it did not support the proposed international convention and asked the health agency to concentrate on policy advice and research.</p>",
  "<p>The reports made it sound like a disaster from the developing world: a man trying to open his shop carried away by a fast flowing flood, fortunately found clinging for his life several hundred yards downstream, by a helicopter; inflatable lifeboats, overturned by the weight of water; stranded people climbing on to roofs of vehicles to escape the rising flood. Yet this was not Bangladesh, but genteel counties of south-east England: Kent, Sussex and Hampshire. Some 60 flood warnings and four severe flood warnings (the Environment Agency's most serious category) had been issued for the south-east by midday, with further rain still to fall. The Met Office reported four inches of rain falling in the region - about a month's average supply - within 24 hours. Six main roads and two motorways were impassable in several sections. Central Uckfield, in East Sussex, was under four feet of water. West Sussex towns such as Haywards Heath, Arundel and Steyning were badly affected. Lewes residents were evacuated when the Ouse threatened to break its bank. Local fire service officers declared the flooding as the worst since 1972. </p> <p>What can be drawn from these dramatic events? Most of the floods were not an accident. They are closely linked to building developments on traditional flood plains along with \"canalised\" rivers, where bends are straightened out and banks reinforced, to make them drain faster. Mechanistic modifications are no match for extreme weather conditions. Whatever the cause of this week's weather, geographers have warned policy-makers that climate change and global warming are going to create many more extreme conditions in the future. Planners will need to recreate the environment that nature provided to meet the unexpected: flood plains that can act as sumps for surplus water. Just another reason why out-of-town developments and supermarkets on greenfield sites need to be curbed.</p>",
  "\u0095 Your headline Anger at slur on women doctors (October 5) was not an accurate reflection of the statement made by Phillip Hammond MP at a private meeting during the Tory party conference. Mr Hammond made the point that over a lifetime female doctors work fewer hours than their male colleagues. This is a statement of fact which in no way reflects the quality of these women. <p>Without committed women doctors, who now account for over 50% of medical school graduates, the NHS would grind to a halt. The need for women to have maternity leave and flexible working practices is not unique to the NHS. A shift needs to be seen in the context of a reduction in junior doctors' hours and the the call for increased accountability of doctors to the public to ensure safe and high standards of medical care. Hence replacing our stressed and overworked NHS staff with men and women working more sensible hours and living more balanced lifestyles may improve the standard of medical practice. Politicians need to be aware that a substantial increase in the number of doctors will be needed. </p> <p>The Royal College of Physicians is reviewing the data on women in medicine to ensure that female doctors have equal opportunities in all branches of medicine and that the working environment is flexible enough that excellent and highly skilled women are maintained in the NHS. </p> <p> <b>Prof Carol Black, <br>Dr Rebecca Fitzgerald</b><br> Royal College of Physicians</p>",
  "\u0095 Certain South African institutions, and the SABC in particular, are legitimate targets for liberal protest, but Christopher Hope (Just like old times, G2, October 11) is unfair. <p>White racism is not a bogeyman; South Africa is saturated and dripping with it. Subliminal racism is also alive and well, as is institutional racism. </p> <p>\"Jewish money circulating 10 times\" is about the problem of township economics and the difficulty of keeping black money in the black community; the suggestion that this reference is \"a choice bit of rant\" is typical of Johannesburg dinner tables. </p> <p>South African tourism, the industry on which this desperately poor economy most depends, is plagued by a negative image originating with the gossip of its white citizens. \"One settler, one Prozac\", might please Mr Hope, but perhaps those in charge of the advertising budget would like, for a change, jokes that recognise the existence of the other 92% of the population. </p> <p>Put Mr Hope's main proposition to any black South African and he or she will laugh. So for whom is the new South Africa \"a lot like the old one\"? For the settlers.

  "Al Gore and George W Bush acted as the image-conscious modern politicians they are and made risk avoidance their priority in Wednesday's second debate by US presidential contenders. <p>In an encounter notable for its civil tone, both men opted for the low-key, conversational style that television viewers prefer, and which is likely to leave Mr Bush holding on to a narrow lead in the polls as the race for the White House enters the home stretch. </p> <p>Most political commentators scored the second of this year's three debates, which took place in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, as a draw: Mr Gore concentrated on avoiding the hectoring tone of last week's first debate; Mr Bush focused on appearing in command of the issues. </p> <p>A series of instant surveys of the viewing audience suggested that Mr Bush made the better impression, but if reactions to the first debate in Boston are any guide, it will be some days before the overall impact is clear. </p> <p>Mr Gore went into the debate after having his worst week on the campaign trail since the phase before the party conventions in August. He adopted a cautious and contrite approach - excessively so, some commentators thought after the debate. </p> <p>He apologised for getting \"some of the details wrong\" in the first debate. \"I can't promise that I will never get another detail wrong,\" Mr Gore said. \"But I will promise you this ... that I will do my best if I'm elected president. I'll work my heart out to get the big things right for the American people.\" </p> <p>Mr Bush, while cautious, appeared less chastened. \"My case to the American people is if you're happy with inactivity, stay with the horse, the horse that's up there now,\" he said in some characteristically folksy closing remarks. </p> <p>With foreign policy issues currently dominating the news agenda, even in the US, the Republican candidate had been intensively tutored for a series of international questions, with which he seemed markedly more at ease than on earlier occasions. </p> <p>In fact, most of the first half of the debate was marked by polite agreement on a succession of issues, in particular foreign policy. Their responses mostly converged on issues such as the Middle East, the Balkans and international trade, although they sparred after Mr Bush insisted that \"nation building\" should not be a US foreign-policy objective. </p> <p>Things got more confrontational, however, when domestic issues took the stage, especially when Mr Gore challenged Mr Bush for his record as the governor of Texas. He appeared to be carefully laying the foundation for a more aggressive onslaught in the coming days by accusing Mr Bush of neglecting issues such as healthcare and the environment. </p> <p>\"I know we have some disagreements on this, and I'm sorry to tell you that, you know, there is a record here, and Texas ranks 49th out of the 50 states in healthcare - in children with healthcare, in women with healthcare - and 50th for families with healthcare,\" Mr Gore said. </p> <p>\"If he's trying to allege that I'm a hard-hearted person and I don't care about children, he's absolutely wrong,\" Mr Bush responded. \"The facts are that we're reducing the number of uninsured as a percentage of our population.\" </p> <p>The last of this year's three presidential debates takes place next Tuesday in Missouri, one of the most hard-fought battleground states in this year's election. </p> <p>Voters go to the polls on November 7.</p>",
  "A parliamentary inquiry in France has criticised Britain's role in a US-run global electronic surveillance system it calls \"a real threat to public and individual liberties\". <p>America and Britain set up Echelon in the cold war to intercept military communications in the eastern bloc. But Arthur Paecht, the inquiry's chairman, said the system was now routinely used to intercept economic and industrial information, including messages between firms in EU member states, and between private individuals that are supposedly protected in law. </p> <p>\"Echelon's mission is to monitor every message in the world,\" Mr Paecht said. \"It is not improbable that the information collected is used for political and economic ends, even against certain Nato members.\"</p>"
