[
  "<p>It's Saturday morning by the Bosphorus and the two most famous people in Norway are talking boats. Behind them a string of vessels that would grace a Bond movie chunter noisily on to one of the world's great waterways. The powerboating Class One circus has come to Istanbul. The Bosphorus - which is usually flat and calm - is probably the fastest track on the Class One circuit, and one of the Norwegians, Bjorn Rune Gjelsten, has particular reason to know it. 'Right here last year we flipped,' he recalls. 'We were pushing really hard to win that race, because we had to win to win the championship. We sat in second place, then came side by side with the leading boat and we ended up flipping in a turn. It was probably the fastest crash in Class One ever. About 145 mph.'</p> <p>So is he nervous to be back here for the first time since then? 'I think everybody should be a little bit nervous,' he says pensively. 'Racing on the real rough, were you're bouncing around, you're hit hard - it aches and it hurts - but it's not that dangerous. It looks dangerous only it's not. But racing here,' he looks out on to the water, 'that can be quite marginal.'</p> <p> Class One - with its mix of speed, money and glamour - is powerboating's equivalent to Formula One, and Gjelsten and Kjell Inge Rokke are among its leading acts. Not that their fame has much to do with water sports. Rokke and Gjelsten made their names as businessmen - Richard Bransons with less facial hair and considerably less negative undertow - and in Norway, where nobody is as famous as a fjord, they pass for royalty. In fact they are more famous than royalty, according to a recent poll.</p> <p> Of course, the very notion of fame in Norway is a bit of an oxymoron: like focusing on America's leading socialists or the best French fast bowlers. In the absence of film stars and pop singers, Rokke and Gjelsten are in the Oslo papers all the time. In Britain they are famous for another reason. Three years ago they purchased Wimbledon FC and have been characterised as 'the mysterious Norwegians' who bought into English football ever since. Later, Gjelsten will tell me that it is only since former owner Sam Hamamm left Wimbledon that he has felt part of the club. 'It feels like we haven't been with the club for a year yet, and how can you be emotionally involved with something for less than a year? I don't think you can. It takes time. But now we have been involved with losing, with being relegated, and that gives you something.' But as they gaze over the glistening water in Istanbul the last things on their minds are a return to the Premiership or John Hartson's fitness.</p> <p> Rokke, the younger and richer of the two, has just returned from a test drive and has dropped in on Gjelsten's Spirit of Norway team for a chat. He looks very much at home, which is hardly surprising not just because the two have known each other for more than 30 years, but because he sold Gjelsten the team a couple of years ago. It's that kind of friendship. </p> <p>With his driving suit tied around his midriff - revealing the Jolly Motors T-shirt of the team he now drives for (but doesn't own) - Rokke looks relaxed as he relives his morning's endeavours. I had been told that the two look alike, which is sort of true even though they don't. Gjeltsen is taller, thinner and, unlike Rokke, wears glasses. Yet their faces lack distinctive features - faces you find it difficult to recall as soon as you look away. Though neither is remotely in the Branson class, Gjelsten is far happier talking to the press than his friend, and comes over for a chat. He first got into powerboating through Kjell (pronounced 'Chell'), he says. Kjell was driving in the US when Gjelsten went over to watch him. 'I made all these comments to him,' Gjelsten recalls. 'He should do this and that. He turned to me and said, \"Bjorn why don't you do it yourself?\" So he did, but not for the reasons you might expect. 'It's not just a question of going out and buying a big boat with the biggest engines,' he says seriously. 'There is a lot of attention to detail. And focus, discipline, being systematic. That appealed to me.' This, it should be said, is exactly what he is famous for as a businessman. He smiles. 'Yeah, I think that maybe is one of my strong sides, and maybe a weak side too: being too focused on details. '</p> <p> Before long the two were racing against each other in Class One, which didn't surprise anyone who knew them. Their friendship can be dated very precisely. Fittingly it began at a competitive event, a cross-country meeting. Both won their respective classes, and afterwards Bjorn's father - a fanatically keen footballer - invited the younger boy to come and stay with them. In doing so he introduced young Rokke to what Gjeltsen himself describes as 'a family where we were always competing'. Bjorn was 10, Kjell eight.</p> <p> There was plenty to compete at but Bjorn seems to have had the upper hand. He excelled at Nordic skiing, going on to represent his country and win international titles. In business, however, Rokke has always held sway, ever since he went off to Seattle as a young man, returning with the reputation as the biggest white fish fisherman in the world - and a lot of money.</p> <p> When they are driving on the water, I ask, are they still competing as they did as kids? 'Oh absolutely, but in a positive way. I think it's good. It drives us.' And - now that he is 44 and Rokke 41- who is the better driver? Pause. 'I think we have different talents,' Gjelsten says diplomatically. 'Kjell was very good before. Then he stayed away a couple of years. He keeps saying that I was dumb to teach him the new tricks. Powerboating has changed a lot in the past two or three years. We've gone from speeds of around 140mph to 160mph. We are now right on the edge when we are racing, we drive slightly different to how we did three years ago.'</p> <p> The combination of Gjelsten's competitiveness and the increased speed of the boats led to the near-disaster last year on the Bosphorus. Gjelsten escaped, if that's the right word, with just a few broken ribs (his throttle man Steve Curtis, he remarks ruefully, only had a cut finger) but the crash left its mark. When Formula One drivers are involved in big crashes they almost invariably return to the fray. But for them it is different. They are professionals. Gjelsten is a very successful businessman for whom driving is - surely - just a hobby. He has a family and a career; why risk it?</p> <p> 'I think you do worry about it sometimes, but your instinct to compete is there,' Gjelsten says. 'For me that's always been the case. For me actually it's more than an advanced hobby. I practise every day. I do my one-hour jog, I go to the gym. I stay fairly fit. Yeah, you can race without being as fit as I am, but you won't win.'</p> <p>Eight minutes. That was the time that Ken Thorne was under water in Oslo earlier this year. He was pushing his boat to the limit - and then she went over. 'I thought I wasn't going to get out of that one,' he says jovially, as if recalling the time he ran out of petrol. 'Eight minutes under water and you think you're a gonner. One hundred and forty to a complete stop in a second.' His memories of the crash remain vivid. 'The cockpit filled up with water in an instant, and then it went completely black. And freezing fucking cold. I had water up my hooter, in my mouth, in my lungs. I'd lost my bearings and didn't know what the hell was going on.'</p> <p> What went on was a high-speed rescue which saw Ken and his throttle man taken ashore, shaken but not badly injured, while his boat, World Of Cars, sank to the bottom of the Oslofjord. It was a narrow escape. Did he ever consider not doing it again? He looks at me as if the question is ridiculous, a sparkle in his eye. He didn't, did he? 'No I didn't.' He likes the danger, doesn't he? 'Yes,' he says the sparkle brighter than ever. 'Someone told me I should take up golf.' Pause. 'I fucking hate golf.'</p> <p> Ken Thorne is a 59-year-old Welsh millionaire from Cardiff with a wife, four children and six grandchildren. His money comes from property development and car dealing but his passion is powerboating. When World Of Cars sank he lost roughly \u00a3300,000 - it wasn't insured - and the first thing he did was look for another ride. Andreas Ugland, another Norwegian businessman, badly injured his back in Oslo and was unable to drive his boat Jotun in Istanbul, so he offered the drive to Ken.</p> <p> Throughout the weekend Class One offers images of itself as a kind of wannabe Formula One and plenty of people would like to further the analogy. But as he sits in the shade of the Jotun team trailer the day before resuming his race career, it becomes clear that F1 doesn't boast anyone remotely as original as Ken Thorne. Everyone told me that he is mad, they love him but he's mad. With arms like hams and his pugnaciously playful manner Ken doesn't give a damn. He just loves being on the water and racing.</p> <p> The big issue in Class One is the Arabs or, to be more specific, the United Arab Emirates. Its leading boat, Victory One, has won three of the past four races and leads the championship by 24 points. With the UAE government prepared to bankroll the team to the tune of around \u00a39 million a season, approximately nine times as much as anyone else, the fear is that in trying to promote their country (powerboating is close to a national sport) the UAE is in danger of destroying the spectacle.</p> <p> Ken, for one, isn't impressed. 'They've ruined it,' he says. 'It's not their fault. The UIM [powerboating's governing body] have allowed it to happen. But the essence of competition is a level playing field, and we haven't got one. They have so much money that they are entering the field with a higher safety margin than anyone else. To compete we all have to go all out all the time. We're pushing too hard. That's what happened to me in Oslo.'</p> <p> Apart from their competitors, there is one other person in Istanbul disturbed by the dominance of Victory One. Just over a year ago Matthias Hauger bought into OSP, the company that promotes Class One. Hauger has a vision of the sport with more teams, more venues and lots more television coverage. That vision does not involve Victory One winning every race - though he doesn't quite put it like that.</p> <p> A 33-year-old former investment banker, Hauger was born in Germany but educated in Britain and has lived here ever since. He is dynamic and friendly, in a Thatcher's child sort of way. Just over a year ago he and his friend and sometime business partner Charles Koppel came to watch Class One and were impressed by the spectacle but not by the promotion. At that time (somewhat confusingly) OSP was owned by Gjelsten, but the Norwegian was keen to bring in new blood. Hauger and Koppel bought into OSP. (Even more confusingly they have also bought into Wimbledon.) Hauger and Koppel don't wish to mislead you as to their motives. 'It's totally a business venture,' says Hauger.</p> <p> The past 10 years have been a time of decline and confusion in Class One, following the sport's heyday in the Eighties when drivers such as former F1 favourite Didier Pironi and Stefano Casiraghi (husband of Princess Caroline of Monaco) raised its profile. The deaths of both in crashes - Pironi in 1987 at Poole and Casiraghi in 1990 in Monaco - played a major part in the sport's downturn. Though the use of fighter plane cockpits has made powerboating much safer, the return to public popularity is a slow process.</p> <p> Hauger sees television as vital. He and Koppel are involved in the production and are striving for a better product. More cameras, more angles. Already there has been progress with broadcast minutes (yes, they do count these things) rocketing from a total of 2,600 minutes around the world last year to more than 36,000, across 100 countries, this. The 2000 championship was thought to have been turned down by the BBC and C4 but gets a regular airing on Sky. Apart from TV, Hauger would like to see the courses closer to the shore, big screens to generate atmosphere and some new locations. This year there are races in Italy, Norway and Turkey (two apiece); and Germany and the UAE. Next year Hauger hopes to add Barcelona and Copenhagen and, perhaps, Britain. Cowes, or possibly Cardiff, have been mentioned. 'From a television and sponsorship perspective we clearly must have a UK venue.'</p> <p> Hauger is frequently described as an aspiring Bernie Ecclestone of powerboating. When I put it to him he looks at me quizzically. Which part of the description is he uncomfortable with: the reputation for ruthlessness, the desire for total control, the legendary wealth? 'I hope it doesn't take that long,' he says.</p> <p> It's Sunday morning, race day, and there is a buzz of anticipation down by the quayside. Well, either a buzz of anticipation or the sound of Class One's camp followers enjoying the early sun and a cup of coffee. There had been a time trial yesterday but the results count only for a separate championship and have no bearing on this afternoon's race. (For the record, Victory One strolled home, nearly two seconds ahead of Gjelsten's Spirit of Norway). Today it's for real. If anything the weather is even better than Saturday: a clear blue sky, brilliant sunshine and no wind. It will be fast.</p> <p> All the pre-race action is in the Tommy Hilfiger sponsorship stand. Rokke is there with his throttle man Jim Dyke. Gjelsten is there with his throttle man Steve Curtis. And the legendary Italian driver and playboy Edoardo Polli is there with his cigar, his throttle man obscured by a plume of smoke. ('Throttle man', incidentally, is a slightly misleading term, certainly if it suggests some sort of bag carrier. In fact throttle men are at least the equals of their drivers, who concentrate solely on steering, and some say it is the more skilful position.)</p> <p> The six are huddled furtively, presumably talking race tactics. Then again, perhaps Rokke and Gjelsten are plotting the takeover of Tommy Hilfiger. If this stand doesn't give away the sort of people attracted to Class One, then the Maserati one next door certainly does. It costs at least a quarter of a million dollars to put on a weekend of Class One and for that sort of money you don't expect to be hobnobbing with the great unwashed. From the sparkling, new pantechnicons which transport the boats from venue to venue, to the expensively coutured hangers-on, to the fleet of pristine scooters everyone uses to transport themselves the smallest of distances, to the boats themselves, the evidence of wealth is everywhere. Class One may be a poor relation to Formula One, but we're talking rich families here.</p> <p> It would be nice to be able to describe the paraphernalia of the powerboating circus as incongruous pitched against the ancient backdrop of Istanbul. In fact there is no paradox at all. Across the quay the villas in this part of town could be from the French Riviera and the boats moored on the opposite shore would do credit to St Tropez. Only when you look across the Bosphorus itself and watch the huge tankers and cargo ships humming slowly between the Mediterranean and the Black Sea do you get any sense of location.</p> <p> In truth the paradox is Istanbul itself: a city laden with historical resonance but more than willing to embrace the lifestyle and values of the 21st century. The satellite dishes sprouting from every rooftop suggest a place less than consumed by its past.</p> <p> Adding to the ambience of Mediterranean chic is Rokke's girlfriend, the spectacularly monikered Selina Middlefart. Her name isn't the only thing spectacular about Selina, a tall, beautifully sculpted blonde who - as if she didn't have enough going for her - is independently wealthy. Class One may not quite have the glamorous following of Formula One, but Selina is doing a pretty good job of redressing the balance.</p> <p> I home in on Rokke. 'I don't give interviews,' he says as he disappears into the Jolly Motor trailer. Clearly his reputation is well founded. To make amends the organisers invite me on to the starter's boat to watch the race from the middle. As someone whose sea legs have never been very reliable I'm not sure this is any sort of compensation, but in this macho environment I don't like to own up to them. It is, I'm told, a great honour.</p> <p>A couple of hours later I'm next to the starter, Richard Ridout, on board his powerboat. Richard is a tubby builder from Bournemouth with a wispy grey beard and an engaging manner. He looks like Richard Griffiths with a clipboard. He tells me I can help start the race by holding the yellow flag aloft until the off. Again I wonder whether this is expecting a bit much from someone with my sea legs. Again I remain silent. How difficult can it be to hold up a yellow flag? As we zoom around the course checking the buoys it turns out to be a lot more difficult than I thought. We are buffeted up and down, the wind raging into our faces. I need all my strength to keep the flag up, but I do get a sense of the speed and exhilaration of powerboats. We are doing all of 30mph.</p> <p> Half an hour later and the moment has arrived. All the boats have to stay within the line of sight of the starter, and behind his boat, until the yellow flag goes down and the green one is raised.In an instant the competitors blaze past us in a swirl of foam and deafening noise and at that precise moment I realise the essence of Class One powerboating. There is only one word for those boats. Monsters. </p> <p> As with many sports, television does not do them justice. Nor do photographs. They are huge. Simply huge. At 46 feet long, they are a good six feet longer than a London bus and more than three times the length of a Formula One car. Each one is powered by a couple of V12 engines that make a terrifying, elemental din. Bjorn Gjelsten may say it's not just a question of size, but in the world of phallic symbols they are most definitely at the hardcore end of the Freudian metaphor.</p> <p> Not only has the start been thrilling, it is also unexpected. Victory One is at the back and the two Norwegians are in the vanguard. By the end of the first lap Rokke's Jolly Motor is ahead, closely pursued by the second Emirates boat, Victory Seven, and Gjelsten in Spirit of Norway. At the end of the second lap, right in front of us, comes a mesmerising bit of racing as Spirit, having drawn level with Victory Seven, undercuts it at the top buoy with a superbly delicate manoeuvre. But before Gjeltsen can enjoy his advantage he inexplicably clobbers the second buoy at the top of the course, allowing Victory Seven back into second place. While confusion reigns on our boat (what are the rules when a buoy has been hit?) the two boats charge down the Bosphorus. The buoy, meanwhile, is nowhere to be seen.</p> <p> By the time the leaders come round again Spirit has retaken second place and the stage seems set for a memorable battle between the Norwegians. However there is a cloud on the horizon. Victory One. After a bad start the UAE boat is moving remorselessly up the field. By lap five it has overtaken Victory Seven to claim third place. One lap later it goes past Spirit into second and on lap seven it takes the lead from Jolly Motor. A few minutes later the Arabs achieve total domination when Victory Seven goes past both Norwegians.</p> <p> And that, quite simply, is that. Just over halfway through and the race is over. Victory One wins by a comfortable margin, its fourth in five races. Victory Seven comes second, Rokke third, Polli fourth and Gjelsten a very disappointing fifth. </p> <p> For a man who has a) just been beaten, and b) dislikes talking in public, Kjell Rokke seems remarkably happy at the post-race press conference. There were two races, he says, and he was happy to have done well in the one in which Victory One was not competing. He even admits to having made a mistake, one that had allowed Victory Seven to pass him. As the conference draws to a close it occurs to me why he's so happy. He may have been beaten by the UAE boats, but he finished ahead of Gjelsten and has overtaken him in the championship. He must be in a good mood because after the conference, amazingly, Rokke agrees to a brief interview. You and Bjorn have a friendship going back 30 years? 'Yeah.' But you beat him today? 'Yeah. We were a little bit more lucky than he was.' Clearly not one to brag, then. You have a long friendship, but you also compete against each other? 'No that isn't true.' Pardon? He says you compete against each other. 'No, I don't compete against him. I compete in the class, and Bjorn by virtue of being a competitor, I compete with him. But I don't compete with Bjorn. I don't think he competes with me either.'</p> <p> Very odd. What's wrong with admitting you and Bjorn compete? By now Rokke clearly wants to get away, but before he can, I ask him whether he would buy another team in the future. 'The reason I got out of it was that I had my own team and I was spending too much time doing it. Now I'm a hired driver for the Jolly Motor team, I get paid for it and I'm happy.' You get paid for it? Jesus, you're the richest man in Norway and it's important that you get paid for it?</p> <p>He shrugs and evades the question. 'Well it's a good team, it's a professional team. I have a job to do'</p> <p>Will he be back next year? He shrugs again. 'If I get hired back, that's the question.' A few minutes later I'm talking to Gjelsten. He is fuming, and wants to explain why he didn't do better in the race. 'We had a very good start, we were leading towards the first bend, which is very important, then we lost the gear,' he says. 'We had technical problems.'</p> <p> All the same he was furious with what had happened with Victory Seven and hitting the buoy. He had to hit it, he explains, to prevent a serious collision. 'I had a line like this,' he says drawing a diagram on my notepad, 'and then we came back like this. I was the first boat to this buoy, I had my nose in front of him. I saw that he was not going to back down, as he should do, because I had the racing line. So I had two options. Either to stay outside of the buoy and him probably hitting the backside of the boat or' His voice trails off. 'I felt very insecure being there and Steve - who's no chicken - said \"Hook it.\" He would have hit me somewhere. Guaranteed. He had his nose up, so I knew he couldn't steer.' The sense of injustice is palpable. Would he appeal?</p> <p> 'No.' Why not? 'I like to race, I don't like to protest.' What about racing Kjell, when they were first and second. Didn't he enjoy that? 'I enjoyed it, but we were frustrated because we should have been in the lead. We had the perfect start. We were first out. But for the technical problems I think we would have been second for sure.' You would have beaten Kjell? 'Yeah. It's fair to say. We were less than three-quarters of a lap behind them, having stopped two times. But that's racing.' And how about their rivalry overall. Who's better at what? 'Well we competed first at track and fields [cross-country]. We were about the same. And skiing, I took it to the national and international level' The unspoken inference was clearly that Rokke hadn't. 'And racing, I've been the world champion. There's never been a Norwegian world champion.' Anything else you two compete at? 'Oh absolutely.' Go on. 'Oh - they're secret.' Business? 'Well, there we usually work together. A lot of small things.' Kjell denies the rivalry, by the way. Bjorn Gjelsten smiles benevolently, a 'yes he would say that wouldn't he?' smile. I tell him that I don't think Rokke wants to tell me anything about himself. 'Well he wants you to stay away from me.'</p> <p>On the quayside that night there is a spectacular gala dinner for more than 400 guests. The atmosphere is relaxed and festive with a lot of the teams letting go after a hard weekend's racing. And everyone I talk to agrees that there is a special rivalry between Bjorn and Kjell, whatever Kjell may say.</p> <p> Most of the drivers are there. Edoardo, surrounded by pretty women, cigar firmly in place. Ken ebullient as ever. Bjorn more subdued, but happily going over his race again. Of Kjell there is no sign. He and Selina have made straight for the airport where they board his own 737 to fly back home. By the time the gala dinner finishes Kjell Inge Rokke is back in Oslo.</p>",
  "<p>Sepp Blatter, world football's top man, is ready to intervene to force through a sale of live TV rights to the 2002 World Cup finals to the BBC and ITV. </p> <p>One thing that Fifa's president will not allow is the reported possibility that Kirsch, the Germany company who are the middlemen in selling on the rights, will refuse to do a deal with the British broadcasters because they can't agree a price. </p> <p>At the moment, talks between Prisma, Kirsch's negotiators, and the BBC and ITV are stalled with a huge gap between the former's asking price and the latter's offer. Prisma want the British pair to pay \u00a390 million each for the finals in Japan and South Korea; the Beeb and ITV, who paid a mere \u00a31.7 million for the last World Cup in France, reckon \u00a320 million is nearer the mark. </p> <p>All the matches in the World Cup finals - from the final itself to the obscurest first-phase contest - are listed, which is why Kirsch must offer the rights to the BBC and ITV. </p> <p>Kirsch shelled out close to \u00a31.5 billion for the rights to the 2002 and 2006 finals and now they are finding it hard to get their money back, particularly for the event in Japan and Korea, whose kick-off times fall badly for Europe. </p> <p>One insider reckons: 'It looks as though Kirsch are going to have to take a bath where 2002 is concerned and hope they can recoup in 2006 when the finals will be in Germany.' </p> <p>*****</p> <p>The Derby may be on its way from Channel 4 to the BBC as part of horse racing's impending television deal. </p> <p>Although the Beeb have not been among the main players in the long-running negotiations, both sides - Arena/C4 and Carlton - realise the BBC's importance in promoting the sport and are prepared to hand them the Epsom Classic, which they have not shown for several years. </p> <p>The Derby would be an important addition to the BBC's racing portfolio, which already includes the Grand National and Royal Ascot. </p> <p>*****</p> <p>'The United bandwagon rolls on,' said Gary Lineker on last weekend's Match of the Day, 'and so does their silence.' </p> <p>Not for the first time this season, Sir Alex Ferguson refused to give the BBC an interview.

  "<p>Barnsley's Dave Bassett has suggested that the Football Association looked for a new England manager in the wrong place. </p> <p>Instead of focusing on 'film stars' (his description), he insists that the FA could have done a lot worse than consider some of the men in the B-movie environment of the Nationwide League. </p> <p>Leaving aside the thought of Bassett himself in the job, the irony of the assertion is that the most successful manager at this level at present is Graham Taylor. </p> <p>His Watford troops, the only unbeaten side in the league, thrashed Grimsby 4-0. </p> <p>After some anxious moments in defence, they seized the initiative with two goals in three minutes. First, Gifton Noel-Williams broke down the right and set up Allan Nielsen for a simple tap-in, then Tommy Mooney headed in a cross from Nordin Wooter. Noel-Williams and Mooney added to Grimsby's misery in the second half. </p> <p>Fulham had a similarly emphatic win, 3-0 over bottom-of-the-table Huddersfield, although it was only in the second half that they produced the form expected of them. </p> <p>Of the other leading promotion contenders, Birmingham, having bundled Tottenham out of the Worthington Cup, were disappointing against Bolton and were held to a 1-1 draw. </p> <p>In the lower divisions two former top-class strikers started new managerial careers on an unbeaten note with Tony Cottee's Barnet drawing 0-0 at Rochdale, and Paul Sturrock's Plymouth drawing 1-1 at Torquay. </p> <p>Cottee has taken on the dual role of player-manager - a tall order for someone who is 37 and has never been a manager before. Indeed, the challenge facing Cottee was illustrated yesterday when Barnet lost 1-0 at Rochdale. </p> <p>Still, one thing in his favour is the help he will get from the previous Barnet manager, John Still, who has stepped into the director of football role. As for what he has to offer, he points out: 'I think I am intelligent enough to give management a go.' He adds: 'I have worked under people like John Lyall, Howard Kendall, Harry Redknapp, Martin O'Neill and Bobby Robson and what I would like to do is take a little bit from each one and add a little bit of Tony Cottee.' </p> <p>While Cottee has been the archetypal goal-poacher, the 44-year-old Sturrock, the former Dundee United and Scotland striker, was noted as an outstanding all-round forward. The other difference between them is that Sturrock, who has already gained experience as a manager at United and St Johnstone, is a newcomer to English football. </p> <p>Despite Plymouth's position near the bottom of the table, and their frustration yesterday in being held to a 1-1 draw at Torquay after being ahead, one suspects that it can hardly be more stressful for him than it was at United. The strain of trying to lift their struggling team was such that at one point, Sturrock collapsed on the touchline.</p>",
  "<p>Wise men nod and say 'Yes, it makes sense. The Daily Mail pays \u00a3100 million for the Daily Express, kits it out as a left-of-centre mid-market tab-loid, effects certain cost savings and synergies, ploughs in \u00a3250 more million over five years... Yes, it makes sense.' </p> <p>But no, of course, it doesn't make sense. </p> <p>There must be another kind of sense in there somewhere. The new Lord Rothermere and his advisers at the Daily Mail and General Trust are very far from stupid. That means they aren't offering \u00a3350m and all manner of guarantees to Lord Hollick for the sake of some historic victory over the ghost of Beaverbrook. Nor are they so moved by the plight of failing newspapers that they feel an altruistic need to bail them out. (Whatever happened to the News Chronicle?) </p> <p>There are other factors in play here. One, perhaps, is in the interest displayed by Conrad Black and his Telegraph management: but that can be overdone. Mr Black doesn't have the deep pockets of the Mail. He has a stretched global business to cope with. He can't compete instantly with the tabloid talent at Lord Rothermere's disposal. </p> <p>Reckon, then, that if his in-tervention has a central purpose it has more to do with printing sites and heavy press metal than it does with act-ively wanting to revive the glories of another ex-Canadian. The Express group may not be making money, but it owns a lot of useful (and maybe cheap) things. </p> <p>Does that kind of dealing animate the DMGT? Of course. But there is another strand to this calculation. Mail executives, off the record, were rather busy last week hymning the wonders (among young readers) of the daily freesheet Metro series. Such fresh, clean neutrality, apparently, should be part of the Express future. </p> <p>Distinctly interesting. The 'Express Metros' going truly nationwide, moving beyond city centres, building a strong advertising pitch and chipping away at the red tops down below and the broadsheets up above. The Star snaps away at the Mirror and the Sun . There's no competition for the Mail in a patch it dominates and controls: \u00a3350m sounds cheap. </p> <p> <strong> As misleading as ABC</strong><br> </p> <p> 'Britain's fastest-growing broadsheet daily'. You can't claim simpler than that - and the Independent doesn't try to in its latest poster campaign. But nothing, as we know, is ever simple about newspaper statistics. Textual analysts rule, OK. So reach innocently for the most recent (September) ABC figures and take them one word at a time. </p> <p>Britain. Fastest-growing. Does that include or exclude the Financial Times (up 17.28 per cent year-on-year as against the Indy's 0.66 per cent)? Perhaps they think that because more than 60 per cent of the FT's sales are overseas, only Union Jack issues count: but even then the pink one triumphs, up 10,000 copies a day at home as against the Independent 's 4,221. And is Scotland Britain? If it is, then the Scotsman 's 27,000 copy surge scoops the home pool anyway. </p> <p>Ah! but they're not talking about copy sales at all. It's the NRS research on readership that counts here for the moment. But watch for the double whammy as readership and circulation statistics seem to tell the same euphoric story - for that second moment is coming. I'll bet that the Independent 's ABC figure for October will be up around 10,000 more copies a day when the returns are published in a couple of weeks' time. Thus the confidence-building posters hailing success. </p> <p>Is there a catch? Alas, in these deep waters there is always a catch. The Independent has just started printing an overseas edition in Frankfurt, churning out some 11,000 copies a day. Most of those will go straight on to the headline circulation total. There's nothing unusual here: the Guardian prints nearly 45,000 copies in Roubaix, Frankfurt and Madrid, which wind up in the same category: the Times does over 37,000 from Charleroi and Madrid. But they don't hail this as a specifically British triumph. </p> <p>Foreign sales are one of the most fascinating stories of Fleet Street expansion over the past decade. Once upon a not-too-distant time, copies were flown out of London to distribution points in Europe (and the Telegraph still does it that way, producing notably stagnant figures). Then the Guardian opened up in Germany and Marseilles and others followed. Modern presses made runs of 8,000-10,000 feasible: more plants meant easier distribution: holidaymakers, ex-pats, businessmen and European universities could get their fix at the morning news stand. </p> <p>It's a market with real possibilities if you can get there on time. The Guardian 's Madrid printing has seen circulation grow in Spain by some 12,000 in a year. But back to the infernal complexity of the ABC - which, to remind you, is designed to help advertisers get a handle on what their money is buying, not to give editors something fresh to crow about. </p> <p>We know about the quagmire of bulk copies, which are basically given away, not sold. The Independent did 33,000 bulks in September (and the Daily Telegraph nearly 50,000). Advertisers may make what they wish of that. How do they factor in ads for British products on sale only at British supermarkets? Will the Indy's Frankfurt 11,000 rush to buy their wine of the week at Sainsbury's any more fervently than the Guardian 's Madrid 12,000 or the Times ' 10,000 will beaver down to Comet superstore in the Old Kent Road for their washing machines? </p> <p>There is always a moment where the old way of doing things gets, frankly, silly. The newspapers aren't happy with the rather violent sampling swings and roundabouts and putting their research out to tender. The ABC way, increasingly, is a mystery wrapped in an enigma. Any real reform would at least combine the two methods of charting success or failure. America does that already. Watch this (British) space.</p>",
  "<p>There is untold pleasure to be had in cooking for yourself. We should do it whenever we can, basking in the luxury of having only ourselves to please. There is no one to regale us with tales about their day or to quiz us about ours, no children, no one to serve, no one to fuss over. At last a meal in which we have only to consider our own satisfaction. Yet no one should regard this as an act of selfishness. Cooking for yourself is simply a matter of self-respect. </p> <p>No one should even think of pitying the single cook. That vision of the lone diner with their sad little can of baked beans and their individual portion of M&amp;S shepherd's pie is actually a myth put around by couples desperately trying to reassure themselves. Most single people I know actually live alone because they choose to, and understand that, while cooking for someone else is one of the greatest pleasures known to man, so is making something fabulous to eat just for yourself. </p> <p>I see no reason why the lone cook should make do with anything less tempting than a couple or family might. A dish of asparagus, a plate of smoked salmon, a family-size pizza, a steak, a warming curry are all regular single suppers in my house. I am never happier than when no else is around, the phone is off the hook and I am contemplating a plate of oysters all to myself. </p> <p>A meal alone is also a time to rejoice in the things that you would not otherwise be able to eat - the fish, steak, mussels, whatever, that your other half/flatmates/ family will not or cannot eat. With everyone else out of the way, you can wallow in that culinary pleasure that you generally forgo for the sake of marital harmony. I have a friend who has not eaten meat for more than a decade because his other half, a life-long vegetarian, won't have the stuff in the house. I keep telling him to leave home and make himself a nice steak supper. </p> <p>There is no shame in making something utterly delectable just for oneself - in fact, I will happily endorse it. For once, we have the supreme indulgence of not having to satisfy or even please anyone else. If this sounds like the culinary equivalent of masturbation, then so be it. To quote the title of one of Delia's books, One is Fun. </p> <p>Speaking as someone who is (now) devoutly single, I often find myself eating alone - though in practice not quite as often as I would like - and highly recommend the solitary supper. Too much is made of the buzz you get from cooking for others. Yes, I know I am the first to harbour aspirations of being the earth-mother-with-the-overflowing-ladle, but that can just as easily be a way of making oneself feel needed. For my money, there is nothing quite so blissful as the bacon sandwich you make for yourself at midnight, when everyone else is tucked up in bed. </p> <p>While no one understands the beckoning call of the Marks &amp; Spencer's vegetable bake more than I, I do think cooking for yourself is the best possible way to spend the first hour or so when you come in from work. Even so, I would never suggest that single people cook themselves a sumptuous meal every night. Part of the bonus of eschewing the shackles of coupledom is that you don't always have to bother. What I do believe is that you should spend at least a few evenings soaking up the pleasure of home cooking. But there are rules. </p> <p>Never stint yourself. Providing funds allow, anything should be on the menu. Whereas some evenings supper may be little more than a tub of hummus, a bag of pitta bread and two-thirds of a bottle of wine, there are others when we should be more than happy to mess up every pot and pan in the house just for ourselves. Why not? We would do it for someone else. </p> <p>And we must have something delicious to drink with our meal. Ignore anything you read about the perils of drinking alone. Such warnings invariably come from smug do-gooders who wouldn't know a good time if one smacked them in the mouth. We should, instead, buy ourselves something exceptionally beautiful to drink. I wouldn't dream of spending less on a bottle of wine for myself than I would if was buying it as a gift or for a dinner party. </p> <p>OK, I don't smoke or drive a car, so I probably have a bit more cash to throw around in Oddbins than some, but to celebrate becoming single again I got into the habit of drinking a couple of glasses of champagne every night before dinner (thank you to the person who invented the Screwpull champagne stopper) and wolfing a little smoked salmon or an oyster or two. And I still do it, every single day. My feeling is that I deserve it. And you know what? I do. </p> <p><strong> A steak sandwich with mustard garlic butter </strong><br> </p> <p>I have been known to make myself saut\u00e9ed potatoes with this blissful, bloody, garlic-scented sandwich. But oven chips will do. Serves 1. </p> <p><strong> a piece of rump steak - about 200g </strong><br> <strong> a small baguette or piece of ciabatta </strong><br> <strong> olive oil</strong></p> <p>For the mustard butter</p> <p><strong> 50g butter at room temperature</strong><br> <strong> a little lemon juice </strong><br> <strong> 1 small garlic clove, peeled and crushed </strong><br> <strong> 1 tsp smooth Dijon mustard </strong></p> <p>I am not sure it matters in what order you do this, the whole thing being over in minutes anyway, but I like to get the butter made first, and if necessary, refrigerated for later. Mash the butter, lemon juice, garlic and mustard together. I usually do this with a fork in a small bowl. Cover a chopping board with clingfilm, lay down the steak, spread it lightly with olive oil, then cover it with another piece of clingfilm. Now bat it firmly with a rolling pin - kit fetishists will no doubt have a professional cutlet bat in their batterie de cuisine - until it is less than a centimetre thick - ideally, half that. Take care not to tear the meat. </p> <p>Get a griddle pan hot. Slice the baguette in half lengthwise and toast it briefly (either under an overhead grill or on the griddle pan) before spreading it with the seasoned butter. Season the steak with black pepper from the mill, then slap it down on the griddle, cooking it for a minute or two only. In a perfect world, the meat will be lightly charred on the outside, pink and juicy within. Season the steak with salt, then immediately sandwich it between the baguette halves, cutting it to fit where necessary, the hot meat melting the garlic butter. </p> <p><strong> Pan-fried scallops</strong><br> </p> <p>Serves 1 </p> <p><strong> butter </strong><br> <strong> 4 large, juicy scallops </strong><br> <strong> a plump clove of garlic </strong><br> <strong> a small palmful of chopped flat-leaf parsley </strong></p> <p>Melt enough butter to cover the bottom of a small frying pan. You want no more than a thin pool. Let it bubble over a moderate heat, then just as it starts to froth, add the scallops. Be prepared for them to spit back at you. After two minutes or so, a golden crust will have formed under them, so flip them briefly over and colour the other side. Whip them out on to a warm plate and discard the butter in the pan. While they are cooking, peel and finely chop the garlic. </p> <p>Put the pan back on the heat and add a thick slice of fresh, sweet butter (about 30g). As it froths add the garlic, swirl the pan around so the garlic turns gold (it should not brown), then throw in the parsley, and if you wish a little salt (I often find shellfish doesn't always need it when cooked this way). Tip the butter, sweetly frothing, over the scallops. </p> <p><strong> Baked aubergine with mint and yogurt</strong><br> </p> <p>A baked aubergine may not sound like a luxury, but its richness is in its texture rather than its price. A simple supper that feels expensive. Some soft Middle Eastern bread would be good here. Serves 1. </p> <p><strong> 1 large, firm aubergine </strong><br> <strong> olive oil - a good everyday one </strong><br> <strong> 2 cloves of garlic, whole and unpeeled </strong><br> <strong> 3 or 4 tbsp yogurt - sheep's if you can </strong><br> <strong> a small palmful of mint leaves </strong><br> <strong>a little ground paprika</strong></p> <p>Wipe the aubergine, removing its leaves, and slice it lengthwise down the middle. Score across the cut sides, going deep down into the flesh, in a lattice pattern. This will help the heat and olive oil penetrate deep into the aubergine. Place it cut side up in a small baking dish or roasting tin then drizzle generously with olive oil. Grind over a little salt, then flip the aubergine over, so the cut sides sit flat on the dish, then pop the garlic cloves, whole and unpeeled, into the pan. Bake at 200 C/gas mark 6 until it is tender and melting, the flesh translucent with oil. This will take a good 45 minutes, but much will depend on the size of your aubergine, so keep an eye out. </p> <p>When the aubergine is totally soft and juicy, lift it on to a plate, squeeze the soft garlic flesh from its skin and smooth it into the aubergine. No need to make a big deal of this, just wipe it over the flesh. Spoon over the yogurt, dust very lightly with paprika and scatter the mint leaves. Scoop the flesh from the skins, mashing it with the yogurt and herbs. </p> <p>\u0095 Visit <a href=\"http://www.nigelslater.co.uk\">www.nigelslater.co.uk</a> for a week's worth of recipes.</p>",
  "<p>No sooner have you dusted yourself down, picked up the pieces and returned to that blissful state of emotional tranquillity and delicious self-indulgence, then along comes somebody to mess it all up again. Within weeks, your social life has been pruned down to the occasional dinner party with other couples, while weekends are spent fighting over the remote control and trying to lure the lumpish body next to you out for a walk. A life that you managed perfectly yourself becomes a minefield of tricky situations brought about by attempting to share responsibilities. </p> <p>Yet the coveted state of singledom continues to be seen as a compromise. When was the last time you heard somebody say pityingly, 'Poor thing, she's still married, you know' - yet that's exactly the sort of presumptuous insult that's hurled at the single dweller on a regular basis. This despite the fact that many marriages involve more misery and compromise than most people who choose to go it alone will experience in a lifetime. The accepted wisdom, that from the day we're born we're duty bound to seek out a like-minded person who'll make two become one, defies logic. You only need the most basic grasp of mathematics to know that two is always two. </p> <p>I had my macro Damascene revelation on the joys of being single about three years ago. It was early morning and the pale light of a wintry sun trickled through my bed-room curtains as I stretched myself diagonally over the expanse of my double bed. Wearing my recently departed ex's pyjama bottoms and my own vest, I shuffled into the kitchen and prepared myself a cappuccino and a bowl of cereal. Then, picking up the newspaper from my doorstep, I slipped back between the still-warm sheets. The radio alarm had switched itself on, and John Humphrys's sonorous tones were reassuring me that, despite a few hiccups, the world hadn't ended overnight. </p> <p>As I lolled around on my bed reading the news and trying to remember my plans for the day ahead, I experienced a quiver of smug contentment. No more breakfast television, no more checking my watch when I was enjoying the company of friends, no more declining of invitations from people who bored him or vice versa, as much theatre as I wanted, no more Sky Sport. The list of my blessings was endless. I was free. I was single again. After years of whining self pity during my regular phases of being single I'd suddenly realised that, far from a being punishment, it was an idyllic state to be savoured. </p> <p>Of course, you can write me off as being a smug yuppie with a comfortable lifestyle and a selfish nature. But you'd be wrong. My modicum of financial security was hard earned, and as for being single, I've tried as hard as anyone to make terrible relationships work. Yet it never occurred to me to rise to the converse challenge of creating a worthwhile lifestyle alone. Like most people in their late thirties, over the last 20 years I've succumbed to the lure of cohabitation on a few occasions. My ex-boyfriends remain good friends, but as I watch them fall like skittles into new unions, I find surprisingly that I don't envy them at all. I've no doubt that despite my best efforts I won't remain in this heavenly state uninterrupted, but the chances are I will return to it again, and again, and again. Marriage has an undeserved reputation as the only way of life worth aspiring to, cohabitation comes a close second, and the popular misconception is that no one would choose to be single. A faintly hypocritical scenario when you look at the state of modern relationships. In the clear light of day, and with the right attitude, going it alone offers many advantages. </p> <p>Nevertheless, being single, particularly as a woman, continues to get a bad press. Pitied (poor thing can't get a man), vilified (single-mum syndrome) or condescended to (isn't it time you grew up) but never celebrated as a chosen way of life. I don't want to turn this into a diatribe about the male of the species - in general I have only the fondest feelings for the opposite sex - but it does seem slightly unjust that when a man chooses to remain a bachelor, he's openly envied by his cohabiting friends and admired by the world at large. A woman in the same position finds none of that respect forthcoming, and can only pray that the day the label 'single' turns to 'spinster' is further away than her menopause. For centuries, men have been prolonging their 'merry bachelor' days. Is it mere coincidence that women only reach a similar jovial state when they become 'merry widows'? I suppose it stands to reason. If a woman has never had the 'official' stamp of approval from a man, then what on earth has she got to be happy about? </p> <p>Any declaration on the joys of being single is invariably met with a sympathetic smile and a pat on the head for being brave enough to pretend you're not suicidal. If you don't answer questions regarding your love life with a resigned shrug and an 'I'll try to do better' attitude, people think there's something wrong with you. No matter how good a time you're having as a single woman, you are expected to be a bit ashamed. It wouldn't do to turn up to a dinner party and boast about the incredible sex you had all weekend with a man you met at a fabulous party two weeks previous. 'What a shame you couldn't get a babysitter; don't even remember what time we left but we danced for hours.' The couples who weren't plain horrified at the notion of such grotesquely casual sex (funny how moralistic people get after they've settled down) would be consumed with envy disguised as sympathy for your delusional state. 'I honestly think she really believes she's enjoying herself,' accompanied by a caring shake of the head while you're happily showing off your bite marks to the person sitting next to you. </p> <p>Sex for the single girl is unquestionably a tricky issue. Even in these supposedly emancipated times, it's still regarded as an activity that men should take pride in doing a lot of and women should try hard to pretend they never indulge in - unless it's in a monogamous, long-term relationship. Well, we all make mistakes and the longevity of the relationship is something none of us can guarantee when, overcome by passion, we find ourselves cavorting on the sofa. Unless, of course, we have a hotline to Mystic Meg. </p> <p>Women may be less profligate with their sexual favours, but they get just as bored by regular bad sex, or indeed just the same old sex. A married girlfriend recently turned to me in fury when I questioned the wisdom of her flirtation with another man. 'You have no idea what it's like to sleep with the same man day in, day out for 15 years. Why shouldn't I have a tiny frisson of excitement in my life?' </p> <p>I'm not recommending infidelity, but she had a point. As Bridget Jones so rightly said, if every married person who condescendingly enquires as to whether you've 'found a boyfriend yet?' had to illuminate you on the last time they had exciting sex (or just sex), they would soon desist. 'Yes, I've found a boyfriend, two or three this year, actually! Oh sorry, don't look so disappointed; didn't mean to gloat. How's Charles?' </p> <p>Most of my married friends question me relentlessly about whom I'm dating in a way single friends fail to do. My independently minded friends aren't less interested, they're just way too busy living their own lives - something I'm afraid cohabitees stop doing the minute they start sharing a front door. How else do you explain the wistful look in their eyes when you tell them you're off to Vietnam for a month? The urgency of their messages when a newspaper reports on an alleged tryst with George Clooney? The obvious resentment when you're shopping together at the Gap and you buy yourself a leather skirt while they hunt for baby dungarees? </p> <p>Men understood way back the benefits of staying single for as long as possible. It wasn't an enlightened state brought about by superior intelligence, but during the Dark Ages only they had the wherewithal. Now, finally, women have the opportunity to enjoy the lifestyle they've worked hard to create. Only a lunatic would leap off that bandwagon having only just managed to manoeuvre your way on! The second your deposit account has upwards of a three-figure balance is surely not the time to throw in the towel and start procreating. The fun is only just beginning. Hooking up with someone involves such a plethora of compromises that just thinking about it makes me nervous. I haven't slogged my guts out for 20 years to spend my much-needed holidays with a man who wants to play Moby Dick on a sun lounger while I trail around the cultural hotspots desperately wishing I had a girlfriend there to keep me company. Or, worse still, not even getting to make those trips thanks to an endless stream of boring in-laws whose only interest is in whether you're up the duff yet. I have trouble enough trying to keep up with my own family without embracing the assorted dysfunction of somebody else's. </p> <p>I want to see the world, meet Machiavellian people, read more books, sleep in, stay out, spend three weeks in a row without switching the television on, eat toast and Marmite four times a day for a month. None of those minor indulgences seem possible once you've let a partner muscle in on your life. Yet I have to listen to endless diatribes from unsingle buddies trying to convince me (and more frequently themselves) that life has perked up since they found someone to push the trolley around Sainsbury's for them. I can let weeks go by without venturing anywhere near a supermarket. Contrary to popular perception, when I open the fridge door and discover only a bottle of delicious wine and a bag of prunes (instead of several varieties of fruit juice and a winebox that hides the telltale signs of tippling) I'm not depressed for a moment. Instead I'm beside myself with relief that it's not full of snack-sized Babybels and six-packs of hideous fruit yogurts. </p> <p>The other day I found myself plucking the ends off a bag full of exotic salad leaves because my friend's husband doesn't enjoy the stems. 'Tell him to do it himself,' I finally snapped when the mundanity of my task grew too much to bear and the gales of laughter from the guests in the sitting room too enticing. 'That's the sort of attitude that explains why you'll never find a husband,' she retorted. Was it churlish of me to point out that that's one of the myriad reasons I don't want another husband at present? </p> <p> For, yes, I too once fell by the wayside. Marriage is something that, with the benefit of hindsight, I now consider on a par with smoking - a bad habit that you either pick up when you're young, or manage to avoid until you're old enough not to care about the repercussions. I leapt enthusiastically into that cauldron at the age of 18 and back out again three years later with third-degree emotional burns. Friends often ask why I don't describe myself as a divorc\u00e9e. When I ask why I should, they mumble an answer which even they are embarrassed to be verbalising. Being divorced is still considered a step better than single, apparently. It means someone once wanted you. No surprise, then, that 'spinster' is by definition a woman who was never lucky enough to marry, yet bachelors remain bachelors forever if they so desire. Society wants to be able to easily identify these poor, failed specimens so we can learn by their mistakes. I'm sorry to disappoint, but I'm less proud of the fact I made an error once than I am of my choice to remain independent ever since. </p> <p>When you ask people to define single, they often find themselves at a loss for words. Does it mean someone who lives alone? Someone who's not dating? In that case, I wasn't single last week; I'm single at present; but between now and the New Year, I'll probably only be single for a couple of weeks. The whole notion of singledom in an era of escalating divorce rates, when unconventional liaisons often outlive their more conventional friends' unions, is faintly ridiculous. It's also a label that only counts in the eye of the beholder. Unless I take out an ad in a national newspaper to announce my union with another or have sex publicly and regularly with one partner, I will continue to be perceived as single. What I do in my private life and the privacy of my own bedroom, or his, or wherever else we choose, doesn't alter my status unless I make a public declaration. One of the happiest couples I know lives in separate flats in the same building. Are they single or just plain happy? It makes you wonder if the only reason we do get married or cohabit is to convince other people that we're not repulsive. </p> <p>The independence of a career introduces the possibility of choosing to live alone, and it's an improvement to the status quo that my generation seem all too happy to embrace. Remember, we've lived through the Ice Storm era. Watched our parents fight their way through unhappy marriages or deal with society's disapproval if they chose to escape. That scourge of society, a single mother, raised me. With no money and no man to speak of, she brought up four functional, participating members of society. Five, if you count me! Now she's finally enjoying her 'state of independence' holidays with friends to Spain or Italy, weekends at music festivals in Wales - she never seems to have a spare moment.The opportunity to have similar choices without waiting for my widow's pension is a legacy my mother and her generation fought hard to be able to hand down. I'm not so naive as to believe you can have it all, but you've certainly got to try and get your paws on as much as possible while you can. </p> <p>Perhaps my own experiences of 'happy coupledom' have something to do with my reticence to share door keys at present. They say that living alone is lonely, but I don't think I've ever felt as alone as in the twilight months of a relationship when a once-busy double bed has become as wide and desolate as Antarctica. The possibility of reaching out for comfort from the other side is as ridiculous as warming your hands on an ice cube. </p> <p>Other low points of cohabitation include the plentiful nights I spent during one four-year tryst sitting at home with my lovingly prepared dinner for two while my partner went AWOL in the Bermuda triangle of Notting Hill pubs. During another relationship, I experienced the most miserable day of my working life. My partners dispensed with my services and my hitherto loyal assistant, with whom I'd been planning to set up a new business, deserted me for their offer of a new car. I called my boyfriend in tears and he offered to leave work early and meet me at home for crisis counselling. I raced back longing for a shoulder to cry and instead found myself weeping into my own chest for much of the night. He finally stumbled in at 2am mumbling about a prior engagement. Nowadays when I'm in trouble I know where to turn. </p> <p> Friendships are the one essential ingredient to a happy life that no single person can afford to underestimate. In the old days, the accepted form of behaviour when you managed to grab hold of a partner was to ditch your pals. Post singledom, your main contact was on the rare occasions when you tried to set them up with someone else. Again an arrogant assumption that what they really, really want is to be just like you. The 'libbers' of old may have been comrades on the picket line, but they kept one eye on their 'sisters in arms' to make sure they weren't running off with their husbands. They still lived in a dog eat dog world where hanging on to your man was imperative - perhaps the reason that old retainers like Fay Weldon and Janet Street Porter still rarely have a good word to say about their own sex. </p> <p>Nowadays we tend to value friendship much more than the opportunity of a leg-over with a pal's husband. For the post-marriage generation, friendship has established itself as the most stable relationship on offer. My friends and I joke about putting our savings into a farmhouse in Tuscany that we can share when we're old and incontinent. We plan on wheeling each other around and reminiscing while making passes at our hunky young gardeners. Friends are for life, while boyfriends tend to come and go. It's your friends who'll prop you up when your relationship crumbles, or you lose your job or life just gets too much. </p> <p>Of course there are lonely days and empty nights, but not just for people who choose to live alone - times when you want a cuddle and there's nobody there, or medicinal sex and not with a stranger. And of course the perfect relationship is an enticing dream. I used to experience physical heartache when watching an ex-boyfriend's parents together. They'd been married for 50 years, and yet when they danced with each other, they still looked like honeymooners. They used to wander around their own garden hand in hand, for heaven's sake! </p> <p>In this fractured world, that sort of 'happy marriage' is becoming an oxymoron. I'd like to have children and hope it will be with someone who adds another dimension to my life. It's true that one can never make two, but if you're lucky two can sometimes be better than one. Especially when they go on to make three and four. Meanwhile, and maybe forever, I intend to gobble up the world in gargantuan chunks. I have a suspicion that spending more time on enjoying your life and less time on seeking a partner may ultimately be the secret to both. One thing's for sure, though. Sitting around moping and waiting for Lancelot is a waste of time. And that's one thing you never have enough of.</p>",
  "At one o'clock tomorrow afternoon, Jack Straw, the Home Secretary, will sit down to a light buffet lunch with a small group of men in his office in Queen Anne's Gate in London. Over smoked salmon sandwiches and sparkling mineral water, they will review the war so far and look forward to the battles that lie ahead. On the sofas around the low coffee table will be Straw's junior Ministers, their aide, and a handful of key advisers. The weekly meetings tend to be informal and convivial. Tomorrow, the mood will be sterner. <p>The next 10 days may see Britain plunged into chaos not seen since the late Seventies. Protests against fuel prices will rage up and down the country. Motorways will be jammed with convoys of trucks; airports ringed with trailers. Fishing boats will block the Thames. Petrol stations will be out of fuel and supermarkets out of food. There will be running battles with the police. In September Britain staggered badly as protests flashed from Dartmouth to Dundee. This time, the protesters hope, Britain will be stretched full length on the tarmac. </p> <p>But, if Straw and his people have done their work well, there will be nothing more than a couple of heavily policed demonstrations and a few minor disruptions. They may distract momentarily from the chaos on the railways and the floods. The activists' hopes of forcing a cut in fuel tax, let alone a general election, will look risible. By the end of the month they will be back in their farmhouses and haulage firm offices with their exhaust pipes firmly between their legs. </p> <p>One of the biggest and most sophisticated operations of its kind ever run by a British government - involving tens of thousands of people from press officers to the head of MI5, from Army generals to low-level union officials - will have worked. The battle will have been won. </p> <p>At the Muir Town Lodge Hotel on the bleak shores of the Moray Firth in northern Scotland, there was talk of revolution last Wednesday night at an open meeting of the People's Fuel Lobby (PFL). Mark Francis, a haulier from Rhyl in Wales and a leader of the PFL, told the crowd that their cause was right and that if they held firm they would win the fight. </p> <p>The crowd listened carefully. Then several stood up to talk. A housewife said the cost of fuel was ruining her budget; a tourist worker said coaches couldn't afford to drive up from England to the Highlands. After two and a half hours, the meeting broke up. Within hours PFL leaders were heading for Newcastle and another planning session. </p> <p>Their aim is simple: to repeat what happened two months ago. Then, a dozen or so committed men caused chaos on a scale not seen in Britain for nearly 20 years. They forced the Government on to the defensive and, for one astonishing week, rode an unprecedented wave of public support. Only when the supermarkets were out of bread and milk, when hospitals cut back operations, when most fuel stations were out of petrol, did they end their protests. Almost overnight the blockades outside the oil refineries and the convoys jamming the motorways disappeared. </p> <p>But the activists, an ad hoc alliance of the frantic, the fanatic and the plain fed-up, did not end their protests unconditionally. Unless Gordon Brown, the Chancellor, made some move to lessen the burden of high fuel prices then, they made clear, the blockades would be back. Their deadline expires a week tomorrow. This Wednesday Brown is due to make his 'pre-Budget statement'. He is not expected to give much, if any, ground. The activists' demands of a 26p cut in the tax on fuel has fallen on deaf ears. There will be no 'hand-outs'. </p> <p>Brown and the protesters agree on one thing: if you want a fight, they are both saying, you can have one. And the fight will be fierce. </p> <p>'At the end of the day we are going to cause as much mayhem as possible,' Nigel Kime, a Lincolnshire haulier at the forefront of September's protests, told The Observer last week. </p> <p>Even the protesters don't yet know quite what form that mayhem will take. The aim is to cause disruption across the country. Last time oil refineries and fuel terminals were the primary target. But, as the oil firms have boosted defences - Shell's Stanlow refinery now boasts new concrete barriers - they may not be an initial target this time. Other plans include: </p> <p> \u0095 using trucks to blockade food distribution centres; </p> <p> \u0095 disrupting the National Grid by switching on farming and light industrial machinery to create surges of demand; </p> <p> \u0095 creating roadblocks by draining vehicles of fuel; </p> <p> \u0095 holding protests across railway lines to halt trains; </p> <p> \u0095 blockading milk depots; </p> <p> \u0095 organising small-scale strikes among supporters; </p> <p> \u0095 and demonstrating outside the homes of Labour MPs. </p> <p>Even before the expiry of the 13 November deadline some protesters will already be on the road. A convoy of lorries and tractors will leave Jarrow on Friday and head south at 25 mph through Leeds, Manchester, Birmingham and Milton Keynes. A second convoy will leave John O'Groats heading for Edinburgh. By the time the main protest reaches London, on 14 November, the organisers hope it will be causing traffic queues 100 miles long. </p> <p>It will end - if the police let it - with a rally in Hyde Park. At the same time a fleet of trawlers will block the Thames. The protesters hope they can snarl up the capital for a week. </p> <p>'Seven days in London should present us with no problems,' says Kime, 37. 'If we end up stuck on the M25, then so be it. If we block up London, then we can seriously damage three major airports.' </p> <p>The key organiser is David Handley, a Monmouthshire farmer who heads the PFL and the more militant Farmers For Action. Handley, 48, has more than \u00a340,000 of debts and has been protesting on behalf of farmers for five years. His dairy farm, rented from Monmouthshire County Council, could soon be taken from him. </p> <p>Handley has left the running of his 88-acre property to his wife and dedicated himself to his campaigns. His boast that he can trigger protests practically anywhere at anytime is not idle. A 'bush telegraph' of mobile phones connecting hundreds of activists has been proven effective. </p> <p>He is not alone. Many, especially in north Wales, will be looking to Brynle Williams, a hillfarmer from near Mold, for leadership. Williams set the protesters' 60-day deadline and led the first protests in September. His associates say they are ready to go to jail. </p> <p>'Let them arrest us. Let's see how big their jail cells really are,' said Clive Swan, a neighbour of Williams's. </p> <p>Police and protesters worry that a few hotheads will hijack the demonstrations. There is evidence of infiltration from far right-wing organisations. There has also been interest from the left, from both anarchist groups and the Socialist Workers' Party. 'I am very worried. As soon as anything violent happens I'm off home,' said Rhys Parry, a farmer who co-ordinates protests in South Wales. </p> <p>The demonstrators' actions will put larger organisations sympathetic to their aims in a difficult position. The Road Haulage Association, the National Farmers Union and the Countryside Alliance all officially oppose direct action. But they face enormous pressure from members who support the protests. Handley is a member of the CA, and Williams is an official in the NFU. For everybody concerned the stakes are high. </p> <p>The Government's planning started in earnest on 18 September, days after the end of the last protests, with a meeting of a 'Fuel Task Force' in the Cabinet Office and of the Civil Contingency Committee, the Government's key crisis management unit. </p> <p>Blair and Straw knew they had to get it right. In the aftermath of the first blockades, the Tories overtook Labour in the polls, albeit fleetingly, for the first time since the 1992 election. The pair agreed that the Government had appeared to lose control. </p> <p>Their strategy was careful and clever. The Government worked out the threats they faced, then moved to eliminate them. One of Straw's first acts was to order one of the biggest undercover operations against non-terrorist targets in Britain for 20 years. </p> <p>Every local police force's Special Branch began to gather intelligence on the main leaders of the protests. The local media was monitored. Dossiers were compiled of activists' police records, finances and political views. Many were put under 'soft' surveillance. </p> <p>The Observer has learnt that operatives from MI5, the domestic security service, infiltrated a number of the more aggressive groups. Their information was critical in determining the Government's tactics. The divisions within the activists - particularly between Williams and Handley - were key. </p> <p>'It was perfect,' one intelligence source said. 'It played to one of this government's greatest strengths.' </p> <p>One of the first lessons learned from the September crisis was the importance of winning public opinion early. The Home Office and Downing Street agreed that a seven-day campaign of media management was needed. Those seven days ended yesterday. </p> <p>Last week was chosen as 'fuel week' because it looked like it would be quiet. Downing Street allowed only one key announcement a day. </p> <p>First, two Sunday newspapers were briefed about plans to use the military to make sure fuel got through. When The Observer had run the story a week earlier, government press officers downplayed it. Now they cranked as hard as they could. </p> <p>On Monday Straw urged people to 'get in stocks' and spoke of the threat to the NHS. On Tuesday and Wednesday Blair repeatedly said the Government would not act when threatened. At the end of the week Straw rammed the message home. </p> <p>There was a more aggressive side to the press campaign too. In September Handley had depicted himself as a Spartacus of the shires, a reasonable man pushed unwillingly to extreme action. It was essential to discredit him. </p> <p>Soon journalists came to hear, from concerned and anonnmous callers, about splits among the activists. Then came suggestions that Handley's business affairs might be worth looking at. One senior union official called him a 'latter-day Arthur Scargill'. A report detailing 180 alleged violent incidents directed at tanker drivers during the last protests was made public. Soon tabloid headlines were branding Handley a 'dangerous fool'. </p> <p>There was spin elsewhere too. Again and again spokesmen repeated that to cut fuel taxes would mean taking money from elsewhere. Predictably they said the money would come from the health service or pensioners. The storms battering the UK helped too. Global warming was highlighted as Ministers suddenly got very green. </p> <p>And, if the going does get tough, the Government has covered its flanks. </p> <p>The oil firms are well on board. During the first protests, when tanker drivers refused to cross picket lines, their relationship with Whitehall looked tense. Now they have pledged to Straw that they will do everything, without jeopardising drivers' safety, to get the tankers out. </p> <p>Essential services are now prepared - a clear contrast with last time. On 26 October, every NHS trust, local health authority, medical supply agency and the National Blood Service received a fax and email from Neil McKay, then the Acting Chief Executive of the NHS, suggesting they stockpile supplies and draw up contingency plans. </p> <p>Many petrol stations are storing three times as much fuel as usual. Thousands of companies and millions of individuals are taking their own precautions, buying storage tanks and jerry cans and filling up. Yesterday panic buying was continuing in southern England. The north was calmer, though there were problems in Liverpool. </p> <p>In the last resort the Government will use force. The policing of demonstrations will be far tougher than two months ago. Senior policemen say protesters are guilty of a criminal act even when just plotting to break the law. Pickets can be arrested for obstructing a public highway - as could slow-moving lorry drivers - or causing a breach of the peace. During the miners' strike pickets were prevented from travelling. 'There's no reason why we can't do the same now,' a former police officer and key government adviser said. Truckers have been warned that they face losing their operating licences if they break the law. </p> <p>And the Government has one last ace to play. A thousand soldiers are ready to drive tankers, more can drive trucks and several hundred men are trained to run the refineries. Between them they will ensure the fuel gets out. </p> <p>But the wild card is the public. The Government's control of public opinion is not as strong as it would like and opinion polls have shown support for the protesters is still high. There is a deep-seated conviction that the fuel tax - currently \u00a337 out of a \u00a350 fuel bill - is too high. There is a temptation to see deeper themes: the city against the country, the capital against the provinces, the urbanite Europhiles against those who have a very different view of what Britain is and should be. </p> <p>But, say academics, the emergence of a group of largely middle-class protesters signals the erosion of Britain's traditional class system rather than a reinforcement of divisions. New alignments are yet to be properly defined. </p> <p>Professor Rodney Barker, an expert on British civil disobedience at the London School of Economics, said: 'I could not have imagined this happening here 20 years ago, or even 10 years ago. The fuel protesters may look like an anomaly, but they might well be a sign of things to come.'</p>",
  "People will forgive - at any rate, they take for granted - many sins by government. Mendacity, laziness, dullness, a certain amount of incompetence and sleaziness, these are anticipated misdemeanours. There is one transgression for which the punishment meted out by the electorate is always capital. Losing control: that is the crime which most often costs a Prime Minister his head when the vengeful voter uses the ballot box as the block. <p>Dictator is the complaint against most of those who inhabit Number 10, but it is the reverse that the country holds in most unquenchable contempt. Nothing smashes belief in a Prime Minister so much as the destruction of public confidence in his capacity to govern. </p> <p>That is why this coming week is so critical for Tony Blair. Images of chaos already swirl around the storm drains of Downing Street and surge up to the sandbagged door of Number 10: panic at the pumps, trains off the rails, Britain under water. It never rains; it floods. Mr Blair, who is a keener student of history than he is usually given credit for, will appreciate the consequences if these rising and spume-flecked waters close over his head. His premiership will be sunk. </p> <p>Drowning can happen to a Prime Minister in the span of a day. The last tenant of Number 10 never recovered from sterling's humiliating ejection from the Exchange Rate Mechanism. That Black Wednesday, when John Major's Cabinet was reduced to a bunch of mutes at their own funeral, was scorched into the national memory with a fatal indelibility. It was the trashing of central London by rioters against the poll tax that put Margaret Thatcher on the trajectory to defenestration by her own frightened MPs. </p> <p>The rats snouting through the piles of uncleared rubbish in Leicester Square during the Winter of Discontent gnawed the guts out of the premiership of Jim Callaghan. The miners and the three- day week impelled Ted Heath to call an election in which he asked: 'Who governs?' The country briskly replied that, if he needed to ask the question, then the answer shouldn't be Mr Heath. </p> <p>This break point has not happened to Tony Blair - not yet. In September, he came so terrifyingly close to bust that Ministers shiver at memories of the fuel blockade that brought the country to within 48 hours of anarchy. Had petrol supplies been throttled for just two more days, the headlines - assuming there were newspapers available in which to read them - would have spoken of middle-class housewives wrestling in the aisles of supermarkets for the last baguette, and middle-aged business executives bludgeoning each other with car jacks for jerry cans of petrol. B</p> <p>ritain lurched to the lip of mass hysteria and, quite possibly, many deaths. Whoever you blame, the Government would have been held responsible. That was the abyss into which the Prime Minister stared. At his darkest hour, he turned to one of his closest associates and said: 'This could cost us the election.' </p> <p>As they assemble their defences for the moment of truth with the fuel protesters, the Government is still trying to dissect why last time they were caught so naked. During a recent conversation with a relevant Minister, I expressed some amazement that no Whitehall contingency unit had raised the alarm when petrol supplies began to run dangerously low. </p> <p>The Minister laughed incredulously. 'What you have to understand, Andrew, what your starting point should be, is the uselessness of the civil service.' He banged the table and waxed industrial in his language as he warmed to the theme, a lament you increasingly hear from many different Ministers across the Government, about how foolish it was to invest any faith in the reliability of the machinery of the state. </p> <p>From Tony Blair downwards, they are not as confident as they sound in public that this time everything will turn out all right. Ministers approach the point of potential combustion believing they are much better prepared for the blockaders, but knowing they are still taking an enormous gamble on the Government's authority. </p> <p>The plan is to play hard cop/soft cop. First, Jack Straw slams the fuel protesters in the kidneys, threatening them with dire consequences if they refuse to come along quietly. Then, this week, Gordon Brown administers the sweet tea and sugared biscuits in his mini-Budget. The Chancellor would be crazy to cut fuel duty, which would be bad for the environment and worse for the Government. </p> <p>A small cut will be scorned as derisory; a reduction in duty of the magnitude being demanded will be an abject defeat. Victory for the fuel wreckers, and their arrogantly dictated 60-day deadline to an elected government, will incite every pressure group with a noisy grudge to press a pistol to the Prime Minister's temples. There will, of course, be palliatives to draw the sting of the anger about petrol prices, but what the Chancellor announces must not add up to appeasement. Number 10 does not want to be reading the word 'surrender' on any of Thursday morning's front pages. </p> <p>They believe they have had some success decoupling the protesters from the public. Sentiment has turned against David Handley, the self-described 'cornered rat', his self-styled 'People's Fuel Lobby' and their self-centred fellow truckers. The Government has made a better fist of articulating the price of giving way to blackmail. Those sections of the press which previously urged the protesters to the brink of lawlessness are warning them off renewed action against refineries. The cause has only one remaining press champion in the Daily Telegraph, the Blockaders' Gazette. </p> <p>The Tories are in a typical tangle born of characteristic opportunism. William Hague originally seized on these 'upstanding citizens' as the shock yeomanry of an anti-government revolt. The Tory leader, suddenly remembering that his party is still supposed to believe in the rule of law and the maintenance of order, is now running as fast as his little legs can carry him to put distance between himself and the militants. </p> <p>The protesters have brought derision upon themselves, not least by the risible attempt to claim comparison between their crawl down the M1 and the Jarrow marchers. Those were unemployed men with starving families who peacefully walked to London. These are subsidy-stuffed farmers and thick-girthed hauliers attempting to inflict massive disruption. You have to ask: if they really are as impecunious as they claim to be, how can they afford to stage this noxious stunt? </p> <p>There is a lively argument within the Government about how much crack there should be in the crackdown. Everyone is agreed that fuel has to flow. Intimidation of tanker drivers must be stamped on quickly and vigorously. After so much rigid rhetoric from the Home Secretary, the macho of Jack Straw will not mean mucho if the police response is as lethargic as it was eight weeks ago. </p> <p>The robustness promised by Martial Straw brings with it hazards. While it may frighten off some of the protesters, there is the risk of provoking the hard core to be more obdurate and more extreme. Some Ministers are fearful of ugly, even blood-stained confrontations if the police start to arrest the road jammers and impound their lorries. </p> <p>It is a call that the Government must not get wrong. Public and press opinion - as unpredictable to Number 10 as they are scary - could again swing against the Government and do so violently. This pivotal moment for Tony Blair will define his premiership for better or worse. His Government cannot afford to be beaten and they know it. While the right hand clenches around the brandished stick, the left hand twitches behind the back, fingers nervously crossed.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Hans Christian Andersen: The LIfe of a Storyteller</strong><br>Jackie Wullschlager<br>Allen Lane/ The Penguin Press \u00a320, pp506<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,501840350,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>The Harry Potter phenomenon, coming after Tolkien, sets off many chimes. The thirst for fairy-tales and allegories, for the domestication of the supernatural, looks to be universal. It is incised in the child and in the fertile mysteries of childhood as these survive in adult men and women.</p> <p>Fairy-tales join hands across time and space, across cultures and languages. The Argonauts become intergalactic warriors; Cinderella darkens into the fable of the three daughters in King Lear; a thousand tales of 'impossible' tasks to perform echo back to the labours of Hercules. Surrealism and science-fiction are derivative from the unrealities, consoling or menacing, of fairyland. Sirens and mermaids sing the great seas of our dreams, themselves voyages, from Homer to Walcott. </p> <p>This universality, this compelling mixture of 'childishness' and enigmatic depths, of laughter and desolation, has long intrigued psychologists. Freud analysed fairy-tales, seeking to unriddle in their spell the suppressed impulses of childhood traumas and nascent sexuality. </p> <p>Jung probed deeper, perceiving in their ubiquity, in the shocks of recognition they bring to us, certain archetypes of the human psyche, certain universal configurations of narrative which are remembered subconsciously and collectively. Like no other mental pattern, the fairy-tale, the metamorphosis of beauty into beast, of pauper into prince, leads us back, like the 'background noise' in modern cosmology, to the origins of the human psyche. </p> <p>The iceberg mass of the world's fairy-tales is anonymous. It arises from sources and occasions, from reveries and metaphoric imaginings innocent of authorship. The elves and imps, the talking animals and witches, the lost children and foundlings which people the landscapes of even the earliest cultures, come late. Millennia of animate shadows precede them. And even at his most inventive, the known, modern master of the genre will draw heavily on the shared inventory, on the global conventions of the genre. Charles Perrault's 'Mother Goose' or 'Puss-in-Boots' draw on a dense layer of folk-tales. </p> <p>The brothers Grimm are inspired collectors of German folk-lore, of tales festive and horrific which had been told and embroidered upon at the fire-side for centuries. The 'invention' of any fundamental motif, of a story that will enter and remain in our common remembrance, is exceedingly rare (if it exists at all). No one came closer to that magical turn than did Hans Christian Andersen. </p> <p>As Jackie Wullschlager shows in her finely documented and insightful biography, so much in Andersen's life had its direct reflection in his inspired fancies. His childhood was one of frequent misery. </p> <p>Seeking employment as a playwright or actor, the 'ugly duckling', during 1820-1822, hung on in Copenhagen virtually starving. Nothing in his harrowed personality seemed to give grounds for hope, except a nascent genius for friendship and the occasional stroke of luck out of the blue, precisely as in fairy-tales. </p> <p>Recognition came almost overnight with the publication, in the mid-1830s, of Andersen's first masterpieces. He was, before long, a European celebrity, the recipient of a royal annuity, the object of caring generosity among wealthy friends and patrons. But no measure of literary glory and material reward could ever efface the deep scars left by Andersen's early years, by the humiliations in his background (his aunt ran a brothel) and by the disappointments which attached to the manifest failings of his 'serious' fiction. Only a master of pain could have written the secret sufferings of 'The Little Mermaid'. </p> <p>As has no previous biographer, notably in Denmark, Wullschlager tackles the absolutely crucial but opaque question of Hans Christian Andersen's sexuality. She does so with unfailing tact and a salutary resistance to psychoanalytic facilities. Andersen made no secret of infatuations with women, notably with the great singer, Jenny Lind. Landed and aristocratic ladies drew his adoring gaze. There is, however, no proof that he experienced heterosexual relations, not even during his visits to prostitutes late in his life. </p> <p>The fundamental homoeroticism, on the other hand, is manifest from the outset. It generated passionate longings for a number of male friends, for a prince of the German imperial house, for a bevy of younger male travelling companions. Ardent letters and kisses abound. 'Do not judge me by ordinary standards,' pleaded Andersen, in a social climate all but closed to open homosexuality (yet rife with its practice). Yet again, there is no convincing evidence of consummation. Only of aching need and rhetoric. Here also, it is the tangled ambiguities of the fairy-tales which come as near as Andersen dared to revelation. </p> <p>It may be that Andersen's obsessive travels, his febrile restlessness as he moved from lodging to lodging in Copenhagen, are a surrogate for a symbolic and psychic compensation in respect of erotic unfulfilment. One feels dizzy at Wullschlager's picturesque chronicle. Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Portugal - voyage after voyage, under often strenuous conditions. Lionised in England, Andersen overstayed his welcome as Dickens's house-guest. </p> <p>Jackie Wullschlager's account of the meeting between these two virtuosi of childhood anguish and unfolding is a delight. Though in failing health, the pied piper continued to chase across Europe and Denmark in pursuit, perhaps, of that elusive ice-maiden who haunts one of his last and most poignant tales. Andersen's funeral, in August 1875, was a national occasion. </p> <p>One would value a more substantial look at the exceedingly complex mutual awareness of Andersen and of Kierkegaard. Wisely, it may be, this book avoids speculating at any depth on the stylistic and psychological means whereby the teller of tales transmutes an often bizarre, localised happening or hallucination into a universal d\u00e9j\u00e0-vu, into a homecoming for children and grown-ups everywhere. Wullschlager ignores the pretentious mists and jargon of deconstruction or postmodernism. Her work is proudly old-fashioned and gives off a classic sparkle. It will bring joy under the Christmas tree, where Hans Christian Andersen belongs.</p>",
  "<p>The cri de coeur is as passionate as any Daily Telegraph diatribe against New Labour, Brussels bureaucrats or the dreaded, loathsome euro. 'The question that irritates me most is when people ask me, \"are you still committed to newspapers?\" ' exclaims Dan Colson, the Telegraph' group's managing director and representative, on British earth, of lofty Canadian media mogul Conrad Black. </p> <p>'We've just commissioned a new printing plant in Vancouver. We're just finishing new plants in Chicago and Montreal and we're about to re-equip both of ours in Britain. The total cost will be not far off a billion dollars. And people still ask, \"are we committed to newspapers?\" ' </p> <p>To reporters seasoned in the economic actualit\u00e9 of business-speak, the question seems entirely reasonable. It is now more than three months since Hollinger, Black's holding company, shook the media world by selling most of his Canadian empire for $3.5bn to cable TV operator CanWest. Yet, bar snapping up a few Chicago papers a fortnight ago, Black has sat on the cash and mightily shrunk his $1.6bn debt mountain instead. </p> <p>The CanWest move left the Telegraph as Black's biggest earner by far and, fresh from being offered a peerage, UK expansion was thought uppermost in the 56-year-old tycoon's mind. Yet in a week of bid mania in the British media there hasn't been a squeak from Black. </p> <p>First, Trinity Mirror snapped up rival Southnews for \u00a3285 million to grab the top spot in Britain's local newspaper market. Then Hollinger's North American rival Gannett and the Guardian Media Group, owner of The Observer, were cleared to bid for Regional Independent Media (RIM), publisher of the Yorkshire Post. And bids thumped on to the table for the Express and Daily Star - the latest \u00a3120m apiece from the Daily Mail and Indian billionaires, the Hinduja brothers. Yet at Lord Hollick's United News and Media, which is running the auction, there has not been the merest flicker of hard cash from comrade Black. </p> <p>Analysts doubt Hollinger has the stomach or appetite for a bid battle with Lord Rothermere's Daily Mail. Senior Express insiders also question Black's record in investing in newspaper titles. Yet they forget the small fortune he has poured into Canada's two-year-old National Post, the first major newspaper to be launched in North America since Gannett's USA Today in 1982. With weekday sales of 325,000 the Post is overtaking the Toronto Globe &amp; Mail and due to make its first profit this quarter, Colson says. </p> <p>'We are certainly interested in the Express,' Colson says. 'We've asked for information. Frankly, we're still waiting for the information and, so far, I'm not sure anyone has seen enough details to make a meaningful offer. We've also got a reputation for not paying over the odds. And that's why we've not got hold of any UK regional newspaper groups.' </p> <p>Hollinger's exasperation with the doubters is easily fathomable, too. When it put most of its 350 North American titles on the block earlier this year, it clearly said control of certain papers, notably the Telegraph, was not up for grabs. Yet it has since rebuffed several approaches for its die-hard Tory title. Among other flagship papers the Jerusalem Post is also off limits, Colson says, despite reports of an auction by Black's Wall Street advisers. </p> <p>'Our intention is to take the CanWest proceeds, pay down the debt and look for other newspaper opportunities in the US, Europe and UK,' Colson says. 'We're now concentrating on bigger titles with more potential for synergies with the internet.' </p> <p>The world wide web was the stuff of science fiction when Black bought his first Canadian newspaper at the age of 22. He was born to wealth, the son of a brewery magnate and the heiress to an insurance fortune, and over three decades the strident right-winger built a newspaper empire to rival Canada's traditional barons, the Thomson family. An eager military historian (Napoleon is his hero, leadership his fascination), Black lighted on the Telegraph in 1985, four years after the Thomsons sold the Times and Sunday Times to Murdoch. At the time the titles were floundering but Black had forged his success on brutal cost-cutting and by 1990 the Telegraph group was handsomely back in profit. </p> <p>In recent years the Sunday Telegraph has gone from third to second place among the quality broadsheets, with a circulation of 813,000 to the Sunday Times's 1.3m, by virtue of a seven-day subscription promotion. But only one-third of those sales are at full price (against The Observer's entire 448,000 circulation). It is a testament to the strength of the Daily Telegraph - which still sells more than 1m copies a day - that Hollinger's UK arm turned in increased profits of \u00a343m on turnover of \u00a3340m last year. </p> <p> In 1994, the Electronic Telegraph was the first UK paper to go live on the internet. And, along with the \u00a3100m or so Hollinger is spending on its printing plants at Docklands and Trafford Park, a total revamp of its web offering is a main priority. This month, the new telegraph.co.uk website will launch sport.telegraph, with travel.telegraph to follow as part of a \u00a310m investment by Hollinger Telegraph New Media (HTNM), the UK internet arm launched this year. </p> <p>Corporately, Hollinger is still looking for a global new media partner, which can bring it the dimensions AOL added to Time Warner. It has also come close to buying papers on the Continent, Colson says. And with the Telegraph titles taking just 4.3 per cent of UK national newspaper circulation, the main opposition to Hollinger buying the Express is likely to come from Labour and Lord Rothermere rather than the competition authorities. </p> <p>Far from giving up print, Black's dream remains to buy a US title to give him more clout than the Chicago Sun Times, Hollinger's biggest US paper to date. And, as befits a Telegraph proprietor driven by power, money and influence, to clinch that seat in the Lords which was blocked by Canadian prime minister Jean Chr\u00e9tien a year ago.</p>",

  "When Rupert Murdoch decreed his Fox television network must turn over an hour of its primest time - between eight and nine in the evening - to unadulterated Bush and Gore, just 2.9 million Americans tuned in. An all-time low, a fiasco. There will probably be an actual turn-out to match on Tuesday. This undynamic duo (as Willie Whitelaw would say) are touring the country trying, pretty successfully, to stir up apathy. <p>But consider: one day, the face of the victor will be chiselled from Mount Rushmore. One day his picture will hang in national galleries and his shrine of a memorial library will draw visitors to Austin or Nashville. Presidents of the United States aren't only politicians who managed to get elected; they become monarchs, gods and legends. It is the great dislocation of the race. While the watching millions weren't switching to Fox, five times that number were watching Martin Sheen play at being President in NBC's West Wing . The drama and the romance of the job still command an audience. </p> <p>But what, precisely, is the job? Stanley O. Jones, a professor of politics at the University of Wisconsin, asked a few questions of the freshman class at Beloit College there. They couldn't (among other things) remember Reagan; they had no idea that Americans were ever held hostage in Iran; they had never seen black-and-white TV; they knew only one Pope - and only one President. For young voters - the most turned-off of the lot - the once and continuing Commander-in-Chief is a man called Clinton and the job is what he's made of it. </p> <p>Jones is making a crucial point in a new collection of essays called The Permanent Campaign and its Future . Once, presidents stood for election. Now they run for election, and Clinton is the great runner. He's been running all his adult life and that life begins to draw to a premature close when there is nowhere else for him to run. Thus the running defines the role. </p> <p>Are Gore and Bush similarly fleet of foot and silvery of tongue? No, they're both comparative plodders. How, then, will they survive in the Oval Office? With lumpen difficulty. </p> <p>The calibre of the contenders, in reality, does not shrink. Is Gore a duffer candidate than Dukakis? Is Bush more intellectually challenged than Gerald Ford? (In fact, if elected, he and Herbert Hoover will tie as the most highly educated presidents in the last eight decades.) What the presidency does do is alter in its demands, a chameleon of elective office. </p> <p>There's no Cold War any longer, so the military dimension is gone and, with it, the awed deference due to the supreme general. Soon, no would-be president will ever have had a realistic chance of putting on a combat uniform. Even now, a few months in fatigues reporting from Vietnam or flying jets for the Texas national guard seems to do duty as the red badge of courage. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the need to raise funds has spiralled beyond previous imagining. Bush has spent $187 million this year. That lowering mountain of need has to be thought of and climbed every month of every year. </p> <p>But perhaps the most profound difference of all is in the parties behind the present pair. They are smaller than they were, diminished bands of activists trading insults across the bowed heads of tens of millions of independents; but diminution also makes those who remain more committed, more ornery, less willing to compromise. </p> <p>The zealotry of the House of Representatives' Newt Gingrich helped fashion is no accident, nor its ruthless pursuit of Clinton's impeachment. When Bush promises kinder, gentler times inside the beltway, he doesn't say how he will change his own visceral warriors there like Tom Delay, the majority whip. </p> <p>We reach election day, of course, without any agreed national budget, stalled between the Hill and the Oval Office. Another symbolic failure: the 106th Congress of the United States has done little but squabble (and line its own pork barrels). These are not accidental impotencies. The balances on Capitol Hill are desperately close: five victories will give the Democrats the Senate, seven the House. Nobody knows how that will look on Wednesday morning - three donkeys ringing on the slot machine or three elephants, but just as likely another division of power. What can be guaranteed, though, is that the focus will immediately switch to 2002 and the next round in the struggle for control. </p> <p>More cash to be raised, more rubber chickens, more wheeler-dealing and long days on the stump. There is never (as Clinton discovered in 1994, when the Congress swung against him) time to govern; there is only the need to keep running. </p> <p>Gore acknowledges that explicitly in his 'fighting' rhetoric and implicitly in interminable photo opportunities, sprinting between speeches, dragging a puffing Joe Lieberman in his wake. Winning the presidency is not the end, but the beginning of new races. </p> <p>Back to the great dislocation. Bush and Gore are being judged - by public opinion and the press - not for what they are, but what they are not. They are not Clinton, with his silky skills, his easy tongue, his undoubted brilliance at running to extricate himself from the last fine mess. </p> <p>Gore oozes facts and policies, yet he can't sell them like Bill. George W. relies on jokes to get him through, but he doesn't tell them as well as Bill. Both of them know that, in office, they would soon have to go crawling after compromise on the Hill: Gore pleading with the warrior Republicans, Bush in all probability needing the Democrats to keep him grounded in independent America where the next batch of votes will come from. </p> <p>Does Tuesday matter? Hugely, in many ways. The President is top dog in foreign policy and rigging the Supreme Court. His choice, for Americans, defines who they are and where they find their own centre of gravity. He will, whoever he is, set an agenda on health, education, social security, that tips some of the balances. </p> <p>But that is also all of a piece with the Murdoch ratings debacle. These are men of the centre ground trying to disguise it, wriggling back and forth and pretending to be something else: the Vice-President who doesn't campaign as well as his master and the Governor whose day job is mostly ceremonial. They field their wives and families like Windsors facing one kind of election and trade trillion-dollar plans like central bankers proving their gravitas. Why should the missing millions be so fascinated by that when Martin Sheen in West Wing does the charade so much better? </p> <p>Predictions are a mug's game. Bush is strong, but weaker in the states that count. Gore is weak, but beginning to erode the preening self-regard, the essential flippancy of the Nader campaign. America can't make up its mind: and that, I think, is because America knows in its heart of hearts that this is just another choice along the way, the choice before the next one.</p> <p><b> THE GORE TEAM</b> </p> <p> Democrat party spending </p> <p> <b> $100m</b> </p> <p> <b> JOE LIEBERMAN </b></p> <p><b> Vice President</b> </p> <p>Considered the 'conscience' of Senate and Democrat party; Orthodox Jew, moral voice and seasoned moderate; good cop and bad cop all in one. </p> <p> <b> BILL DALEY </b> </p> <p><b> Chief of Staff</b> </p> <p>Tough nut from the 'other' Democrat dynasty in Chicago, brought in to rescue and direct campaign.

  "We speak the same language, watch their films and have fought and died together. Most of us feel we know America well. But the time has come to be wary of our century-long ally. The world's hegemonic power has been becoming more isolationist and self-interested ever since the Cold War ended, but if George Bush becomes President it could become genuinely nasty. <p>As British Euroscepticism reaches more hysterical and irrational peaks, the real story of our times has gone largely unregarded. The superstate whose ambitions menace our sovereignty and frames our policy choices is not the European Union - it is the USA. </p> <p>The range of American influence is already intense and growing. It was American investment banks which wanted to put the London Stock Exchange up for sale to Frankfurt. Our enfeebled film industry depends on distribution through American-owned cinema chains. Our research scientists register their patents at the US Patent Office. Our drug companies seek the approval of the US Federal Drug Administration. Our academics make their intellectual mark by being published in American journals refereed by American professors around American benchmarks and objectives. </p> <p>Our politicians look to America for their policies - William Hague 'denationalising compassion' as he attacks the welfare state or Gordon Brown building a social policy around tax credits are both overtly borrowing from Republicans and Democrats alike. And the American companies buying up our leading firms bring with them the same expectation about how to lobby and how to union-bust as they do at home, generating copycat British political lobbying firms and copycat legal experts adept at bending employment law. </p> <p>This is an American capitalism much harsher and more profit-seeking than ever before. It is creating a society in which everything - even votes - is increasingly up for sale. We think America is the same friend it has always been, but it is changing for the worse. </p> <p>Those with doubts should take a look at the US's relations with the rest of the world. The international framework in which the British operate is firmly run from Washington, and President Clinton has chosen not to challenge a tide in which the assertion of 'America first' is becoming ever more aggressive - and which Bush is pledged to intensify. </p> <p>If you are worried about global warming and climate change, then beware Bush; he will have no truck with any international treaty limiting the emission of American carbon dioxide. Debt relief for the poorest countries? Forget it. The establishment of an international criminal court? Baying for the Moon. Even American support for the United Nations, IMF and World Bank - flawed as they are - should not be taken for granted. Bush, for all his homespun affability, is bad news. </p> <p>He personifies the new business-led American ideology. He portrays Washington and the Federal government as evil, business and the private sector as virtuous. He has no truck with those who worry about the decline of public debate, public spirit or the common interest. Bush's heroes are those of American conservative mythology; the god-fearing, gun-owning, male small farmer or small businessman who is rugged and self-reliant. His 'compassion' does not stretch to spending hard cash on alleviating poverty or promoting educational opportunity. That would be unAmerican. </p> <p>Bush and the coalition of the Business Roundtable, National Rifle Association (NRA) and Christian Right which supports him are indifferent to the gross inequalities that disfigure American life; the mushrooming of millions of 'gated' communities at the top and the harsh insecurity at the bottom. Nor do they worry about environmental despoilation of their country, the violence in their cities or the gross commercialisation that intrudes into every avenue of American endeavour. Rather, they would advance inequality with across-the-board tax cuts that favour the rich, entrench gun ownership, weaken what is left of universal medical and pension provision, and cut corporate interests free of what little regulation remains. It is sheer poison. </p> <p>The depths to which Bush and the Republicans have sunk is their mendacious approach to the impact of money on American politics. This will be the most expensive presidential election campaign ever. Total political advertising expenditure, including soft money, is estimated to be more than $1 billion. And the business givers - the investment banks which demand more financial deregulation, the NRA which wants no change to the gun-control laws, the drug companies opposed to prescription drugs, the oil companies which want to drill in the protected wilderness and so on - all want to buy private advantage at the expense of public interest. </p> <p>In this, the Democrats, however business-friendly they try to be, will always be outspent by the Republicans. The trick is to evade the formal laws on campaign finance by enlisting interest groups to advertise on your behalf, which as long as their adverts do not mention 'vote for' or 'elect', is deemed as soft money - and legal. In the last four weeks, the Republicans and their networks have outspent the Democrats two to one, literally trying to buy the election. </p> <p>It makes a mockery of democracy, as both Bill Bradley and John McCain - challenging for the nomination of the Democrat and Republican parties - argued in the primaries. But while Al Gore is pledged to attempt some reform of campaign finance, Bush is unapologetic. The state should not stand in the way of those who want to give money to politics. </p> <p>It is an indifference to the public domain and accompanying celebration of the private that is uniquely American - and which has deep roots in the experience of the early settlers and the expansion west. Extending citizenship rights beyond the narrow domain established by the eighteenth-century constitution and into the social and economic realm has always been fiercely contested by the American Right as 'unAmerican'. </p> <p>Yet the paradox is that Bush's challenge comes as a growing mass of ordinary Americans are ever more concerned about the harshness of their capitalism, the decline of their politics and the illiberality of much social policy. Religious attendance is falling as is support for capital punishment. There is no fall-away in the support for international engagement. Support for gun control mounts. There is no especial demand for more tax cuts; rather, there is a recognition, as in Britain, that necessary public goods have to be paid for. </p> <p>Without his stunning war chest or the 'integrity' issue after Lewinsky, Bush would be in trouble. But if he wins, or even narrowly loses on Tuesday, his campaign stands as a warning. Beware the powerful American Right - they menace us all. Left-of-centre British Eurosceptics please note. </p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.algore2000.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.algore2000.com</a><br> <a href=\"http:// www.georgebush.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.georgebush.com</a> <br>Official sites for the leading candidates  <a href=\"http://www.nadertrader.org\" target=\"_NEW\">www.nadertrader.org</a> Vote-swapping website for Nader <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/Election2000\" target=\"_NEW\">www.gallup.com/Election2000</a> Opinion polls <a href=\"http://www.gwbush.com  www.algore-2000.org\" target=\"_NEW\">www.gwbush.com www.algore-2000.org</a> Spoof sites</p>",
  "There is fairly strong evidence that living in a committed partnership is good for both your mental and physical health. Married people, men in particular, live longer and enjoy better health than their divorced, widowed or never-married peers. Married women rate their physical and emotional health higher than single, divorced or widowed women, especially when they get older, says Linda Waite, a sociology professor at the University of Chicago and co-author of The Case for Marriage (\u00a317, Doubleday). <p>But don't let your mother dash out to buy a hat just yet. Marriage by itself is no magic shield against the world's ills. It's living in a loving and supportive environment that counts, especially, it seems, if you are a woman. An unhappy union can do more than get you down; it can even depress your immune system and make you prone to stress and illness. By cultivating healthy habits and making sure that they have good social support, single people can get many of the health benefits enjoyed by couples without having to say, 'I do.' </p> <p>As for married couples, one of the reasons they are sometimes healthier has to do with economics. Married couples often have a joint income, and so are wealthier than singles. If you have a higher income, live in a nice neighbourhood, own your own home and have access to private health care, you're bound to be better off. Sociologists also think that healthy people are more likely to marry in the first place, as they are more attractive to prospective partners, which skews the figures for single people's health. </p> <p>Couples also look out for each other. Living with someone who nags you to go to the doctor, eat well and exercise might get up your nose, but will be doing you a favour in the long run. In the good old days, men benefited most, as their wives encouraged them to calm down, and end their wild, youthful habits of boozing, smoking and unsafe sex. But as women have come to equal men, so they have picked up on some of their bad habits. 'Single women are now entering into the risky behaviours of single men,' says Penny Mansfield, director of One Plus One Marriage and Partnership Research. Isn't it time we all settled down? </p> <p>Emotional back-up is key to both mental and physical wellbeing. 'We're beginning to realise just how much mental health is connected to physical health,' says Mansfield. Patients recover faster from heart disease and cancer if they have a supportive partner. New mothers are less likely to suffer long-term post-natal depression if they have a happy relationship with their other halves. Given that happy people equals better health equals economic prosperity for society, there's a strong case for introducing some form of marriage for gay and lesbian couples on these grounds alone. What used to be a moral argument for promoting stable relationships has now become a health issue. </p> <p>But do you really have to be married to your lover to be healthy? Waite argues that you do. 'Living with a partner gives you some of the benefits of marriage, but not all of them,' she says. Cohabiting couples are generally less likely to share financial resources, and in many cases are unable to share perks like health insurance. The main difference, says Waite, is down to the dreaded C word - commitment. Still, there are plenty of cohabitees who have lived in unwedded bliss for years who could teach us all a thing or two about that. 'These are all averages, and you can't always make your personal life decisions based on statistics,' argues Dorian Solot, executive director of the Alternatives to Marriage Project, a Boston-based organisation for unmarried people. 'If we as a society really cared about people's health, then the answer is not to urge everyone to get married but to try to support people, whatever their needs are.' </p> <p>Although statistical studies are based on keeping up with the averages, they do reveal intriguing insights into human nature and why marriage seems to have such a positive effect. One of the key findings is that we all need a close confidante - someone who can help share our burden of worldly troubles. This seems to be especially true of men. Mr Average's stiff-upper-lip machismo is his Achilles' heel when it comes to his mental health. Young men are three times more likely to commit suicide than women, because they find it hard to seek help if they have personal problems. A government survey on mental health attributed about a quarter of the rise in suicides among young men to the fact that they weren't getting married, says Mansfield. Women not only offer a shoulder to cry on, but also seem to calm men down and give them a sense of purpose, she adds. But what's in it for the girls? </p> <p>This is where it gets complicated. Although married women enjoy better health than their unmarried peers, the benefit is smaller than it is for men. Just being married has a powerful effect on men, but for women the quality of the relationship really matters. One study has shown that women who felt they couldn't confide in their husbands were more prone to depression. But people in poor relationships lose more than their peace of mind. Recent research suggests that couples can actually affect each other's physiology, for better and for worse. Scientists at Ohio State University prodded couples into picking fights in their labs. They found that husbands and wives who rowed with their gloves off, using sarcasm, put-downs and general nastiness showed signs of weakened immune systems, with the women being more affected than their husbands. 'Women are more sensitive to emotion in marriage,' suggests Tamara Newton, a psychologist at the University of Louisville who worked on the study. Even just recalling the memory of a row can make a wife's blood pressure rise. </p> <p>But although being happily single is better than being unhappily attached, it might not always seem that way. You're surrounded by smug marrieds, the world is blind to your charms, and even your lucky knickers have temporarily lost their love magnetism. What to do? Don't panic. A wedding ring holds no mystical magic. It's the social and emotional support that counts, and wily singles can get this in spades, if they know where to look. Finding people to trust to share your confidences is key. A sympathetic ear helps you make sense of life and cope with the world. Women tend to be good at supporting each other. For men, forming close friendships with women, especially family members who can give them advice, is particularly important. </p> <p>On a practical level, friends and neighbours can also help, if you share out burdens, like taking turns with the shopping, or ferrying the kids to school. In a world where more and more of us have moved away from our families to study and work, creating 'families of choice' from our closest friends is key to staying healthy and happy. But that isn't to say that your own family is out of touch. Picking up the phone is an important way for family members to look out for each other. It's the little things, like someone asking after you, that count. </p> <p>But if you really want to get ahead, get a cat. Karen Allen, a psychology professor at the State University of New York has discovered that pets are better at helping people cope with everyday stress than their spouses or friends are. Elderly women with pets get the same benefits in terms of stable blood pressure as those who have lots of friends. Again, the key is having someone, or something, to talk to. 'Pets are always non-judgmental,' says Allen. No matter what the problem, Fluffy will always love you. But canine confidantes can do more than reduce stress - they can also play cupid. Scientists at Warwick University have found that taking a walk with a dog can triple your chances of meeting people of both sexes. Still, if the thought of anything furry brings you out in a rash, try keeping a journal. Confiding your troubles to a diary really helps, says Waite. </p> <p>Researchers in the States have discovered that people who belong to lots of different social groups, such as sports clubs and church congregations, live longer and have healthier immune systems. 'People who are socially active in different ways are generally better off in terms of their health,' says Sheldon Cohen, a psychology professor at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh who led the research. </p> <p>Personal relationships might be complicated, but they are our most valuable assets. The health implications of relationship breakdown are so great that government health policy should take it into account, says Mansfield. This will become especially important as the current generation of singles ages. But as well as picking up the pieces when things go wrong, we need to improve the quality of existing partnerships, as well as supporting people who live alone. Splendid isolation might not be ideal, but you'll get by - with a little help from your friends.</p>",
  "<b>The widow</b> <p><b>Margot Barnard, 80, a founder member of the Bonn Zionist Youth Movement, left Germany for Palestine in 1936. Five years later, she met a British soldier who she later married; they returned to england in 1945. He died in 1964 and she's been single ever since. She gives talks in schools and universities about the Holocaust.</b></p> <p> 'I remember thinking in my forties that things had turned out pretty good. I'd spent most of my marriage as an army wife and enjoyed helping him with stage work. He was an entertainer. We had two teenage sons, a lovely home and a car. \"I've got everything I've ever wanted,\" I thought. But two months later, Ted was dead. It was 1964, and he died following one of the first open heart operations in England. People couldn't cope with death in those days, and I was ignored completely. An added problem was that I was still a good-looking woman, so the neighbours saw me as a threat and didn't want to know. For several months, I sat quietly in my room but then I thought, \"You've got to fight back.\" I didn't want to become a sad and lonely person. </p> <p>The first thing I did was to go away with my eldest son, then 18, on a package tour to Italy. I came back replenished, sold our house in Bexleyheath and moved to a flat in London. Although at first I found decision-making daunting, I soon came to enjoy it. </p> <p>At first I couldn't find an entrance ticket into the London social scene because I had no profession and people had no label with which to describe me. I remember one well-known writer introducing me to her friends with the words, \"This is Margot Barnard... but she's very nice.\" </p> <p>I knew I had to make some money, so I took in a German student as a lodger. That was how I started to make contact with the German youth. I wanted to stretch out my hand to the next German generation. </p> <p>I never feel lonely because I love being able to do what I want to do. I've always loved my independence: I even ran away from home at age 14 because my parents disapproved of my Zionist activities. I have lots of young friends, I go out a lot and still give talks in English and German schools. </p> <p>Since being widowed, I've had only one boyfriend, but it finished when he asked me to marry him. I liked my independence too much.' </p> <p><b>The gay man</b></p> <p><b> Jeremy Haneman, 28, is a musician and arts editor working on the launch of Queercompany.com, an e-commerce facility designed for the gay community</b> </p> <p> 'I've never been in a long-term relationship. The longest I've ever been with a person is five months. I like being single - it suits my state of mind, which is generally to be free and happy. But I'm not discounting a relationship. If someone comes along, brilliant, but I'm really happy the way I am. </p> <p>People tend to think that gay men aren't good at forming relationships, but I'm not sure if that's because they're gay or simply because there's a lot more pressure on heterosexuals to settle down. I think people can sense if you're desperate for a relationship and they steer clear because they don't find it attractive. Also, lots of people have hidden agendas: they want to be in a relationship because it's good for their self-image or because everyone else has a partner or because they don't want to be alone. About 50 per cent of my friends are in relationships, but there aren't that many who I actually envy. I see a lot of deception going on. Of course it would be lovely to form an amazing relationship with someone I loved, but I won't do it as a compromise to social pressure. </p> <p>I like being able to do what I want to do. I go out a lot to clubs, bars and restaurants, and I like having the sexual freedom to see whoever I want. But I also like being alone.' </p> <p><b>The Thirtysomething</b></p> <p><b> Anna Rickard, 31, is a quality officer for air pollution. She's been single for three years</b> </p> <p> 'People have said I have too high expectations. In the past I've tried to compromise, thinking may be I'll grow to like them, but it's never worked. Now I think, \"What's the point?\" The older you get the more you want from a relationship. I'm looking for a man who's dynamic, open, sensitive - and it's difficult to meet someone with those criteria. Also, I've got used to being by myself and the idea of sharing my life feels quite alien. You get selfish because you haven't had to consider someone else's feeling for a long time. </p> <p>The relationships I've had have all ended for different reasons, though I've initiated quite a few of the break ups. I tend to get bored. A long-term relationship can become mundane at times, and you have to work at it. I like the freedom of being single, of being able to live the lifestyle I like, and I've had the odd fling in the past three years. I meet blokes if I go out to a bar, but none of them has worked out. </p> <p>My friends provide me with all the friendship and companionship I need. I have male and female friends, some single and others in relationships. We go out in a big gang and have a good time together drinking, cycling, diving. </p> <p>I'm very happy hanging out with my friends, going off on exciting holidays when I want to, but I wouldn't want the lifestyle of my friends who have settled down and had babies. I think I'd feel trapped. I can see how much you have to compromise and give up when you have a baby. I'm probably a bit selfish for that right now. That's not to say I wouldn't like the close company of a boyfriend, but it's not top of my agenda. On the other hand, if I'm in this situation in five years' time, I might be slightly worried. </p> <p>I don't like being the only single person in a room full of couples, especially if it's all lovey dovey or baby talk. I feel quite alien to that, and I guess it brings it home to me that... oh my God, will I be left on the shelf? But I don't worry for long. I like my life, and I don't want what they've got right now.' </p> <p><b>The Commitmentphobe</b></p> <p><b>Josh Howie, 24, is a music-video rep. He is the son of Lynne Franks and Paul Howie</b></p> <p> 'I have a low attention span, and while I've slept about a bit, I find it hard to maintain a relationship for long. After a couple of weeks I stop returning the phone calls, and the big phase out begins. I'm not good at confrontation. The trouble is, while I might find a girl my age attractive, once my sexual appetite has been satisfied I get bored. Often it seems that the better looking the girl, the less need they've had to develop their personality because they've been able to manipulate men by playing on their looks all their life. </p> <p>For me, relationships are all about learning something and being with someone who can bring out the best in you. Younger girls don't have that ability. I've been with older women too, and certainly they have more interesting stories to tell. They've been around the block; they know all the crappy ways you're thinking because they've been there. </p> <p>I go out a lot and I'm constantly ready. My antennae are always up and I'm all set to bring on the charm. I was a very late developer and for years had to put up with constant rejection. Then suddenly the acne disappeared, I was 6ft tall and everyone wanted to know me. Perhaps my slight misogynist tendency comes from years of rejection. </p> <p>I like to think I've given a woman the best night of her life - it's a kind of \"look at me, I'm a stud\" mentality. But also on some level I'm paranoid I'm a fake. I find it hard to respect someone I've slept with. I show them my best side and still feel fake and think, \"Oh, you didn't spot that. I can't quite believe you bought my bullshit.\" </p> <p>A lot probably stems from insecurity. If I talk about my fear of intimacy with a girl who I'm trying to chat up, sometimes that just feels like another tactic - \"the honest trip\" - whereas they're thinking, \"I'm going to change this guy.\" So you can't win.'</p> <p><b>The Divorc\u00e9e</b></p> <p><b>Patty Deppe-Greenall, 39, was married for 14 years until last year, when she divorced her husband. She is a consultant astrologer who writes two columns for internet sites and has two children, Daisy, 11, and William, eight.</b></p> <p> 'People look on me as the baddy because I divorced my husband, but it takes a lot of courage to leave a 14-year marriage. I started studying astrology a few years ago after not having worked for 10 years. It wasn't my aim to become independent and support myself, but that proved very useful. As the marriage failed, I started working with clients and teaching. I built up my confidence by consulting over the phone. </p> <p>At first I was afraid of being on my own, but the quality of my life has improved immensely. I don't have to fight all the time or constantly clean up. Now I'm able to pay for the mortgage and the bills myself. Sometimes I spend more than I make and I'm always thinking of ways to make money, but at least I have a good time. </p> <p>When I was with my husband, I didn't have any drive or energy. Everything I did seemed to be constantly defeated. But now I'm getting things done. I've even mended the heating, which broke down three years ago, and put in a new carpet: people say the atmosphere is great in the flat now. I go out a lot more, too - to films, restaurants and bars. Before, there was never the money to do anything because my husband felt we had none. That attitude is very infectious. </p> <p>At first when I found myself single again, I couldn't bring myself to date. The first time I had a date I made it for three weeks ahead and then cancelled the day before. Now I've gone on a few dates and it feels much more comfortable. </p> <p>My astrology has a lot to do with becoming free. Part of the problem of getting married at 23 is that you don't know if you're compatible. In our case, we weren't. Over the last few years I've been finding myself again, and now I'm happier than I've been for a long time.' </p> <p><b>The Twentysomething</b></p> <p><b> Lisa Sanders, 21, lives at home. She is currently helping out in her father's double-glazing business, but is planning to start her own ironing business</b> </p> <p> 'When I was about 17, I had a one-and-a-half year relationship. It ended because it all got too routine. We'd stay in or go to the cinema, all of which I found quite boring. When it was over I felt liberated. </p> <p>Now, about three or four nights a week, I go out drinking and clubbing with the girls. We get merry but never loud and drunk. There are about 10 of us, and we're out to have fun. I've been around these girls since primary school, so we know each other inside out. If one of us has a problem, we rally round and support each other. Recently we all went on holiday to Cyprus and then to Dublin for a friend's birthday. I like having a laugh and going shopping with my friends. We get our hair done and buy stuff. Most weeks I'll buy clothes and shoes. I've got loads of shoes, probably about 80 pairs. </p> <p>What I love about being single is that you can do what you want. If it happens, it happens. I enjoy male company, but only as friends. I've got a couple of close male friends who come out with us and who I treat just like the girls. Sometimes I meet other guys while we're out but I never go off with any of them. I wouldn't without getting to know someone first. If they're good company, I'll take their number and meet them another time. </p> <p>If a boy wants to have a relationship, I tell him, \"I don't want one, but if you can handle being friends, let's go out and have a laugh.\" They don't seem to find that too much of a rejection because I'm not saying, \"I don't like you\", I'm just saying, \"I don't want a relationship.\"' </p> <p><b>The single mother</b></p> <p><b> Jacqueline Keiza, 32, is a single parent with an 11-year-old son, Francis. She is currently studying psychology and counselling</b> </p> <p> 'When I met Francis's father at 17, I slowly gave up one thing after another because he didn't like them. When I left him at 21, I remember thinking, \"Where are my hobbies, what did I used to do?\" It was like having a blank page. By 25 I was listening to my rock music again, watching black-and-white movies and doing sculpture - all the things he's made me give up. </p> <p>I've been single for 10 years, and during that time I tried to spend as much time with Francis as possible. When he was four, I got a job as a night-care officer so I could still be with him during the day. I would never bring a man back to the house because I didn't want my son to grow up with the notion that women are easy. </p> <p>At 20 I was very traditional. I thought you had to be in love before you slept with someone. But when I was 23, I met an Irishman and had my first one-night stand. It was great and gave me a taste for that kind of thing, although I haven't had sex for five years. I think I frighten men because I'm so assertive and independent. My sense of self comes from having regained my independence since leaving the long-term relationship with Francis's father, which stifled me. </p> <p>I love my freedom. I love going to hear rock bands, though I usually go alone - my friends don't like loud music. I don't believe in the traditional type of relationship where people live together. I think people are just conditioned to want that. </p> <p>If I were to enter into a relationship, we'd have to live separately. I don't want to make someone else stay up late, listen to music and watch black-and-white movies. Equally, I don't want to be made to watch football. People need their own space, and if they don't get it, they end up looking and sounding like their partner. Living up to someone's expectations drowns you. </p> <p>I love being alone and am far too busy to get lonely. My aim is to be a little bit selfish. It's important to do something for yourself sometimes instead of constantly giving to another person.

Now I've reached a state of equilibrium. A lot of my friends who married young are getting divorced, and I see them suffering both financially and emotionally. And I'm very glad I'm not in their position. But I do sometimes miss the intimacy and companionship of a steady relationship. When I worked in advertising with a large salary, it was easier to maintain one. Now I have a more erratic lifestyle, with unsociable hours. At this time of my life, I need to be focused - on my work during the week and being a dad on the weekends. Also, women of my age expect stability and commitment from a man, which I find difficult to give. I'd find it hard to put my heart and soul into a relationship, unless I met a woman who was understanding, stunning and not high maintenance. I want to start a relationship from a base of security when I've achieved some of my business ambitions.

  "<p>Only in cyberspace. Pop icon Madonna wakes up one morning to find her name is being used as a web address for a hardcore porn site. The material girl, livid at the outrageous idea of her name being linked to sex, starts legal action to retrieve the address - only to find that the budding pornographer who owns it, in a fit of pique at losing something that cost him $20,000, is offering it for gratis to the Madonna Rehabilitation Hospital, Lincoln, Nebraska. </p> <p>But last month, after a series of legal manoeuvres, the singer retrieved the domain name after arguing that she had been using the Madonna name professionally since 1979. A spokesman for the hospital said: 'We are devastated. We wanted the name because it would have meant people could find us easily and for its religious connotations.' </p> <p>The Madonna case highlights the legal complexities at the heart of the internet. Addresses are arranged hierarchically by the Domain Name System (DNS) - the global database established to facilitate navigation around the web. But the problem is that as the web expands, the DNS is finding it increasingly difficult to cope. All the good dotcom domain name addresses have been bought, and there is an urgent need to create more. </p> <p>There are more than 30 million registered domain names in the world, of which more than half end in the '.com' - denoting that they are commercial sites. By 2002 this number will have doubled on current projections. Some experts even go as high as 75m. But a failure to address this problem will have a profoundly negative impact on the way the web develops. </p> <p>David Post, Associate Professor of Law at Temple University Law School in the US, argues that sorting out this problem is a 'life-or-death' matter for internet companies. 'If your name and address cannot be found... you simply do not exist - at least, not on the internet.' </p> <p>Sorting out the problem is the job of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (Icann), formed two years ago by the US Department of Commerce. Icann has been praised for dealing effectively with problems involving so-called 'cyber-squatting' - when individuals attempt to profit from a company or personal trademark by buying up related domain names (such as in the Madonna case). Since the arbitration system set up to resolve such issues was established last December, Icann has been inundated with more than 1,800 complaints. </p> <p>'It's doing a difficult job as fast as it can. I think the US government must be pretty pleased,' said Philip Atkinson, head of intellectual property at Eversheds law firm. </p> <p>But this is where the plaudits stop. </p> <p>In a bid to satisfy soaring demand for domain names, Icann has pledged to release a new batch, which will perhaps - and the emphasis is on perhaps - include endings such as '.web', '.firm', '.info' and '.shop', allowing for greater differentiation between addresses. </p> <p>There is only one hitch. The whole system is in chaos. Icann has been pledging such a move for most of this year and has consistently postponed making a decision. News was expected this summer. Then in the autumn. Educated guesses now say it won't be until early next year before there is any progress. </p> <p>The escalating delay has caused some companies that specialise in selling domain names to start the process without Icann. They are already allowing people to sign up, speculatively, for new names, despite the fact that no one knows what these will be. Punters are handing over non-refundable fees of \u00a310 or \u00a320 simply to register their interest in a new top-level domain name such as ones which end in '.bank' or '.eu.' 'It's a complete scam', was the verdict of one domain name expert. </p> <p>Last month, in a case that smacked very much of closing the stable door after the horse had bolted, Icann put out a statement warning speculators of the pitfalls associated with their actions. This was seen as symptomatic of the way Icann now functions. </p> <p>'The perception is that the industry has moved on and Icann hasn't. It's been inactive with regards to a lot of policy concerns. It's more of a think-tank with no real bite,' said Nik Imrie, marketing and web development manager with Domains.com, one of the world's largest domain name registries. </p> <p>Some Icann supporters say the reason the release of the new batch of domain names was delayed was due to technical fears - there would be too many new names swamping the system for a roll-out to work effectively. </p> <p>Icann is now talking about operating something called a 'sunrise policy', which will allow the largest companies (such as FTSE 100 firms) to buy up the domain names relating to them first, in a bid to smooth the path and avoid further cyber-squatting wrangles. </p> <p>But this will also bring problems. Icann is already considered public enemy number one by many internet aficionados who see it as an oligarchy hell-bent on regulating cyberspace to ensure its own preservation. 'How can we be assured that Icann will be able to resist pressures to stray beyond [its] \"technical\" mandate? Where are the checks on the new corporation's exercise of power?' Post asked in a scathing article posted on the internet. </p> <p>Indeed, the whole Icann structure is seen by many as representing the antithesis of the internet. 'We really must ask whether we really want or need this kind of global internet policy,' states a stern press release on the website for the pressure group Icann Watch. </p> <p>In addition to Icann's perceived powers there is a concern that it is merely a mouthpiece for the US government. 'There is a real fear that Icann places American law over other countries' laws - even for many operations entirely within these countries,' said Simon Moores of the Research Group, an internet consultancy. </p> <p>In a bid to answer its critics Icann recently tried to make itself more democratic and accountable. In March the organisation stated that its board of nine unelected directors was to be replaced by an 18-member elected council. </p> <p>But this process has degenerated into high farce. Only five elected members are so far on board and four of the original directors are refusing to quit. Now Icann is being torn apart by infighting. One of the recently elected appointees, Karl Auerbach, wants Icann's president, Mike Roberts, sacked. Auerbach says he finds it impossible to say 'anything positive about' Roberts. Another elected Icann director, Andy M\u00fcller-Maguhn, a German hacker who belongs to the famous Chaos Computer Club, has also been scathing about the way Icann is run. </p> <p>The organisation's failure to deliver on its promise to be more accountable prompted Michael Froomkin, a Miami University law professor who specialises in analysing the legality of government agencies, to declare that Icann is 'an essentially unaccountable private body that many feel has already abused its authority in at least small ways and is indisputably capable of abusing it in big ways'. </p> <p>It seems that, while Icann might be successful in sorting out the minor problems - such as getting Madonna her domain name back - it faces tremendous problems grappling with the bigger issues and is in danger of falling apart. Icann chairwoman Esther Dyson, one of Silicon Valley's most famous entrepreneurs, is set to quit this month. Expect further pyrotechnics soon.</p>",
  "<p>The historic city of York was last night bracing itself for more chaos after escaping further devastation yesterday by just two inches. </p> <p>The worst flooding in nearly 400 years brought water almost 18 feet higher than normal, peaking just below the defences that surround the city centre. But weather forecasters warned that torrential rain will sweep across England and Wales throughout today in a severe gale that could swell water levels further. </p> <p>Police, soldiers and firefighters - who have already laid 65,000 sandbags around the city centre in recent days - were using the brief respite to reinforce defences. Police Chief Superintendent Gary Barnett said: 'We are on a knife-edge at the moment and it doesn't look like it's going to change for the next two or three days.' </p> <p>An extra 500 troops remain on standby to help out those already at work, many complaining of exhaustion. </p> <p>As the battle to save York was reaching its climax, Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott flew in by helicopter and pledged to speed up and increase payments to local authorities to help pay for damage. The Government will now pay the total cost of repairs - rather than just 85 per cent - and it will make sure the local authorities get the money within 15 days. In York alone, more than 3,000 people have been made homeless from the floods so far. </p> <p>After an emergency Cabinet meeting in London, Prescott promised an additional \u00a351 million for improving flood defences over the next four years. More money would be spent on research into climate change, and on examining the link between global warming and the current floods. 'Severe flooding could become more common as a result of global warming,' he predicted. </p> <p>Prescott visited victims of the flooding and told them he had 'great sympathy with houses and businesses which have been affected by the flooding. All we can do is give a warning [about the looming storm] and try to minimise the damage.' </p> <p>Railtrack warned that the new storm would lead to further turmoil to Britain's collapsing rail system, bringing delay to a huge programme of urgent maintenance planned for this weekend. More than 35,000 metres of track were due to be repaired over the two days, with most of the work taking place today. 'We always said it would be dependent on the weather, and with more rain on its way we could face some difficulties,' said a spokesman. </p> <p>More train delays are of little concern to the residents of River Street in York, a row of two-up, two-down terraced cottages. They paid over the odds for the picturesque location of their homes; this weekend they realised just how high a cost. </p> <p>It was early afternoon on Friday when Sharon Newsome looked out of her kitchen window and saw murky brown water lapping underneath her garden gate. Within two hours ice-cold waves had filled her yard knee-deep and were breaching the sandbags around her back and front door. Soon it was above her ankles. </p> <p>Newsome, 33, a college lecturer, said: 'The furniture went upstairs straight away. But then I just stood and watched as it grew darker and damper. Eventually I just thought I can't watch this anymore, and I had to leave.' </p> <p>Returning yesterday, she assessed the situation. 'People have been saying, \"Well at least you're insured\", but it's not the same. Those are my things in there and they can't be replaced.' </p> <p>Insurance may not cover the long-term costs of the floods. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors warned this weekend they could have a severe impact on house prices, creating an epidemic of 'property blight' in flood-prone areas. New rules are being intoduced to make sure that all homebuyers are warned about the risk of flooding, making it far more difficult for people to sell high-risk homes. </p> <p>The institution's Christopher Legrand said: 'It could create a blighting situation. There could be significant difficulties for people who have properties in flood plain areas. It's one of those unfortunate situations that happens occassionally. There is nothing you can do about it.' </p> <p>That would make it difficult for Karen Long. Her house is one of the worst hit in River Street.'We were carrying out the dogs and cats last night when I stepped off the back step and suddenly I was waist deep in water.' </p> <p>A passing dinghy from a houseboat some 200 yards away, on what had once been a distinguishable bank of the River Ouse, came to the rescue of Long, who is three months pregnant, and her partner Gary. </p> <p>'We were doing the house up,' she said, standing on the closest spot of dry land to her house, 20 feet away. 'The floorboards had just been laid and polished.' </p> <p>Even those who escaped by the skin of their teeth have a further day or two of worry. </p> <p>But yesterday under blue skies, York had almost a holiday atmosphere as families turned out to line the city's bridges to capture the dramatic scenes. </p> <p>Police patrols have been stepped up to prevent looting but many of emergency service personnel were taking the chance to catch up on some sleep before another possible night of evacuations.</p> <p><strong>Useful links</strong> <br><a href=\"http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk\">Environment Agency</a><br><a href=\"http://www.meto.govt.uk\">Meteorological Office</a></p>",
  "<p>When NewsCorp officials gathered in the Hong Kong convention centre last March to unveil their latest Chinese internet investment, a tall woman handed out a business card that read 'News Corporation/Wendi Deng Murdoch'. </p> <p>Deng is not a NewsCorp employee. Once a junior executive at the company's Star TV in Hong Kong, Deng, 31, quit her post before marrying NewsCorp chairman Rupert Murdoch last year. Since then, she has been portrayed - by Murdoch and the company - as a traditional housewife who attends to decorating, her husband's diet and the like. </p> <p>But Deng is no homebody. Though she doesn't have a formal position with her husband's media empire, she has quickly asserted her influence over NewsCorp's operations and investments in Asia, its most important growth market. </p> <p>Working with her stepson, James Murdoch, 27, Deng has initiated or advocated Chinese internet investments totalling between $35 million and $45m, according to a top NewsCorp executive. With her advice, the company has also formed partnerships with cable companies in the region looking to upgrade their systems for high-speed video and internet access. </p> <p>Murdoch, who is 69, has never hesitated to put family members to work in his businesses. Last month, he named his eldest son, Lachlan, 29, deputy chief operating officer, in a move partly aimed at clarifying that he is his father's heir. James serves as chief executive of Star TV and has carved out Asia and the internet as his province. Even Murdoch's ex-wife, Anna Mann, whom he divorced last year, has an office and assistant at NewsCorp's New York offices, although she no longer has an active role with the company. </p> <p>Now, Deng is rising to a place of prominence in the family business. </p> <p>People within NewsCorp and outsiders involved in the Chinese internet and media industries say she identifies potential investments for her husband's company and acts as his liaison and translator in China. </p> <p>These people say Deng is well suited for this unusual role. The daughter of a factory director in Guangzhou, China, Deng came to the US 12 years ago with the aid of a California couple. The husband in that couple later left his wife for Deng. She mastered English, climbed from a California college to Yale's business school and eventually landed at Star TV in Hong Kong. </p> <p>Having left China in obscurity as a teenager, Deng is now returning in grand style, as the wife and adviser of a global media baron. </p> <p>'Wendi gives NewsCorp a Chinese face in China,' says Joseph Ravitch, co-head of the global media practice at Goldman Sachs Group, which advises NewsCorp on its Asia strategy. 'She represents not just the company but the owner, and that's critical in a country where families are very important.' </p> <p>Murdoch has long been fascinated by the potential of the Chinese market, and his Fox studio was a pioneer in the country. But at times, he has seemed to lack the feel for subtleties his wife is said to have. In 1993, shortly after he acquired control of Star TV, Murdoch made a still-notorious remark that satellite TV would prove 'an unambiguous threat to totalitarian regimes everywhere'. China immediately retaliated by banning private ownership of satellite dishes. Reception by private households of Star TV and its affiliate, Phoenix Satellite Television, remains illegal in China, though many cable operators and residential compounds defy the ban and carry the channels. </p> <p>Murdoch gradually repaired relations with the Chinese. He pulled the BBC from Star TV, making the channel more palatable to the Beijing government. He sold the South China Morning Post to a pro-Beijing businessman. And at his behest, NewsCorp's HarperCollins publishing unit killed a book contract with the last governor of Hong Kong, Chris Patten. Today, NewsCorp's officially restricted Phoenix channel is a favourite among urban Chinese households, and the company has greater access to the mainland market than any of its competitors. </p> <p>With the exception of an odd mention in the newspaper gossip pages or a glossy magazine photo spread, Deng has stayed out of the public eye. She accompanies Murdoch on his worldwide jaunts and stayed at his side when he received prostate cancer treatment last summer. </p> <p>Shortly after they were married in June 1999, Murdoch told Vanity Fair magazine that his relationship with his new wife precluded her from working for NewsCorp. Instead Deng was 'busy working on decorating the new apartment' in Manhattan. He said his bride, a graduate of the Yale School of Management, was 'a bit frustrated' by the narrow scope of her activities, adding, 'We'll just have to resolve that somehow'. </p> <p>The resolution has taken Deng far beyond choosing upholstery. She has become a de facto diplomat on behalf of NewsCorp in China, a country where good relations with government officials is critical to success. Over the past year, she has met with politicians from President Jiang Zemin down. In one of her few answers to written questions, Deng said she had met the Chinese president only at large gatherings on 'formal occasions'. Deng also said she hadn't initiated any meetings with 'top level' Chinese government officials. </p> <p>In recent months, Deng has appeared with increasing frequency at the side of her husband and stepson James in NewsCorp business meetings. She sometimes intervenes to smooth over potentially awkward situations. In March, for example, she and the father-and-son Murdoch team met a well-connected Chinese businessman in Shanghai, in the hope of advancing NewsCorp's push into the Chinese TV market. The meeting got off to an uncomfortable start, at least partly because of the language barrier between the Murdoch men and their host, according to a participant. But Deng used her bilingual fluency to put everyone at ease,. </p> <p>Deng has become deeply involved in the company's analysis and negotiation of business transactions in China, according to people who have dealt extensively with NewsCorp. Entrepreneurs trying to interest the company in their ideas often go first to Deng, according to a person close to NewsCorp She has told this person she sometimes receives more than 100 emails a day from Chinese people with business proposals. She sometimes meets entrepreneurs at NewsCorp's offices in Beijing or at one of the city's business- gathering spots, such as the St Regis bar. </p> <p>NewsCorp executives say that among the deals Deng has helped forge is a recent multimillion-dollar company investment in Netease.com, one of the most popular web portals that target the mainland. Earlier this year, she worked with James Murdoch to negotiate NewsCorp's investment of more than $10m in the Chinese-language internet company renren.com, according to Anthony Cheng, founder of the website. Cheng recalls that at one meeting about renren.com, Deng displayed her deep involvement when she grilled him on the difference between the site's marketing strategies in Beijing and Shanghai. She calls him with ideas from time to time on how to improve his company, Cheng adds. 'She's very keyed into all the News Corp and Star TV properties and how to better link them,' he says. </p> <p>Deng initiated News Corp's investment last December in SinoBIT.com, a Beijing website that seeks to link entrepreneurs to investors online, according to Steve Sun, the site's co-founder. She did so by introducing Sun, whom she knew through mutual friends from Yale, to James Murdoch, Sun says. At the same time, people who have done business with Deng say she appears to take great pains not to overstep her unofficial role. Sun notes, for example, that she didn't attend a second meeting between him and James Murdoch, at which the terms of the investment in SinoBIT.com were finalised. 'She gave James the right to make the decision,' Sun says. </p> <p>Deng hasn't neglected the business of minding Murdoch, who has undergone the kind of change in appearance often associated with a man's marrying a much younger wife. </p> <p>Murdoch for decades preferred establishment addresses such as New York's Upper East Side and Bel Air in Los Angeles. But after remarrying, he and Deng set up home in Manhattan's trendy SoHo district, a few blocks from the apartment of Murdoch's son, Lachlan. Known for his British-style double-breasted business suits, the older Murdoch started sporting black turtlenecks. NewsCorp executives say that sometimes he even forgoes a tie at the office, once unthinkable. He told Vanity Fair he is pumping iron with a personal trainer at 6am and downing a morning concoction of fruit and soy protein. </p> <p>When Deng began appearing at Murdoch's side about two years ago, NewsCorp executives wondered where she had come from and how she got there. They knew nothing about her other than that she joined Star TV as an intern in 1996, shortly after obtaining an MBA from Yale. Deng herself hasn't commented in the press about her background. </p> <p>Born Deng Wen Di, in the eastern Chinese city of Xuzhou, her parents later moved to the southern city of Guangzhou. Deng was the family name. She later compressed her Chinese first name into 'Wendi'. Deng's father served as director of a machinery factory in Guangzhou. The family lived in a three-bedroom apartment, unusually large by Chinese standards. Wendi Deng has two sisters and one brother. A good student and champion volleyball player, Deng had enrolled in Guangzhou Medical College by the age of 16. </p> <p>Her ticket out of China came in 1987, when she met a Los Angeles couple, Jake and Joyce Cherry. Cherry, then 50, was working in Guangzhou, helping the Chinese to build a factory to make freezers for food-processing plants. The Cherrys' interpreter told them of a young woman who was looking for help with her English. Joyce Cherry, then 42, says she began tutoring the teenager. In the fall of 1987, Joyce Cherry returned to Los Angeles to enrol her two children in elementary school. Cherry stayed in China to finish the factory project. </p> <p>Soon after Joyce Cherry was resettled in Los Angeles, she says, her husband called to say that Deng wanted to come to the US to study. He asked Joyce Cherry to help complete the paperwork and get an application ready for a local college. The Cherrys sponsored Deng's bid for a student visa and agreed to put her up until she had established herself. The 19-year-old arrived at the Cherry home in February of 1988. She shared a bedroom and bunk beds with her hosts' five-year-old daughter. </p> <p>All was not well, however, between the elder Cherrys. Cherry, who arrived home shortly after Deng came to California, had grown physically ill in China from a combination of overwork and poor diet. The spouses' separation had strained the marriage, the Cherrys concur. At the same time, Joyce says she had grown increasingly suspicious about Deng's relationship with her husband. She recalls discovering photographs her husband had taken of Deng in coquettish poses in his hotel room in Guangzhou. Cherry confirms he became infatuated with the young woman. Once they were in Los Angeles, he says, Deng started making recommendations about his diet and wardrobe. </p> <p>When her husband and Deng didn't return home some evenings, Joyce says she concluded they were having an affair. She told Deng to leave, and Cherry left soon afterwards. He moved into a nearby apartment with Deng, who had enrolled at California State University at Northridge, a commuter college in the San Fernando Valley. </p> <p>The Cherrys divorced, and Cherry married Deng in February 1990. But that union didn't last. Cherry says that about four months after the wedding, he told Deng to leave because she had started spending time with a man named David Wolf. Cherry was 53 at the time. Wolf was in his mid-twenties, only a few years older than Deng. Wolf, who declined interview requests, worked in the early Nineties for an import-export company. He spoke some Chinese and was interested in a career in China, according to someone who knew him. </p> <p>Cherry says he and Deng were briefly reconciled at one point, but they split up for good when it became clear she was continuing to see Wolf. 'She told me I was a father concept to her, and it would never be anything else,' Cherry recalls. 'I loved that girl.' </p> <p>Divorce records filed with the Los Angeles County Superior Court show that the Cherry-Deng marriage lasted two years and seven months. That was seven months longer than what was required for Deng to obtain a green card, allowing her permanently to live and work in the US as a resident alien. Cherry says he and Deng actually lived together for 'four to five months, at the most'. They haven't spoken since 1996, he adds. </p> <p>During the early Nineties when she was married to Cherry, and for a time after that, Deng on some occasions introduced the tall, well-dressed Wolf as her husband, according to people who knew Deng. Ken Chapman, a California State economics professor, recalls that the last time he saw his former student, in 1995, she handed him Wolf's business card and said she could be reached through her 'husband'. At 5'10\" herself, Deng and Wolf made a striking couple, according to people who knew them. They shared several addresses during the Nineties and told friends that they had met in China, when Wolf had been there on business. </p> <p>For a time in the early Nineties, the couple worked at a suburban Los Angeles gymnastics academy operated by Li Ning, a Chinese three-times Olympics gold medallist. Deng served as a liaison between the gym's Chinese coaching staff and parents of the school-age clientele; Wolf, as the gym's general manager. Today, Wolf works as a director in the Beijing office of Burson-Marsteller, a large PR firm. </p> <p>In 1996, Deng graduated from Yale and began looking for a job. Through a friend, she met Bruce Churchill, who then oversaw finance and corporate development at NewsCorp's Fox TV unit in Los Angeles. She lacked experience in the entertainment industry, but had an Ivy League business degree and was fluent in English and Mandarin, attributes of particular value to News Corp's struggling Asian satellite service, Star TV. Churchill, who was on his way to Star TV as deputy chief executive, offered Deng an internship in Hong Kong. That grew into a full-time job. </p> <p>Even though Deng was a relatively junior employee, she took an active role in planning Star TV's activities in Hong Kong and China, according to former NewsCorp colleagues. She helped build distribution in China for its Channel V music channel, for example, and explored interactive TV opportunities for the company's News Digital Systems arm. </p> <p>Rupert Murdoch frequently talks to NewsCorp's business development executives around the globe, so it isn't surprising that one day he would cross paths with Deng. In early 1998, she first appeared at his side, acting as his interpreter in Shanghai and Beijing. </p> <p>By that summer, the Star TV staff was buzzing about romance between the pair. After dinner meetings in Hong Kong, they were observed holding hands. In May, Murdoch had separated from his wife of 31 years, Anna. The split surprised even his closest aides, who say they hadn't seen any sign of a rupture. </p> <p>Murdoch told senior Star TV executives in the autumn of 1998 that his relationship with Deng was 'serious'. Star TV's then-chairman, Gareth Chang, told Murdoch at the time that it was a bad idea for Deng to remain on staff, given her personal relationship with the parent company's chairman. That wouldn't be a problem, Murdoch replied, because Deng would be resigning and moving with him to New York. </p> <p>Today, Rupert and Wendi Murdoch spend time not only in SoHo, but also at their home in Bel Air and on a ranch near Carmel, California. Murdoch controls about 30 per cent of NewsCorp, a stake worth roughly $8.7 billion. He has said the stock is owned by trusts that name his three children as beneficiaries. </p> <p>Rupert and Anna Murdoch's divorce became final in June 1999. Negotiations over a divorce settlement dragged on for nearly 12 months, as Anna Murdoch's lawyers tried to determine the extent of NewsCorp's global assets. Financial terms of the settlement weren't made public, but the Murdochs have said they agreed on one crucial point: that their children eventually would gain control of the company. Five months later Anna Murdoch married widower William Mann, chairman of Henry Mann Securities in New York. Rupert Murdoch and Wendi Deng were married on June 25, 1999, 17 days after his divorce became final.</p>",
  "<p>To ensure Britain's homes are watertight and its transport system trouble-free during future floods will cost billions of pounds, leading civil engineers and water managers are warning. </p> <p>Years of under-investment and short-term profiteering by the big housebuilders, rail companies and local councils have left Britain unable to deal with extreme weather. </p> <p>And we will have to play a massive game of catch-up if flood defences are to be sufficiently robust. </p> <p>\u0095 Roads may have to be dug up to fit drainage suction pumps which should have been installed when they were first built. </p> <p>\u0095 Tens of millions of pounds will have be spent shoring up electricity pylons and overhead electrical rail cables. </p> <p>\u0095 A major redesign of housebuilding methods could cost up to \u00a3150 million per year, adding thousands to the price of a new home. </p> <p>\u0095 Additional safety measures for tall buildings will also be introduced, adding to the rent burden of UK businesses. </p> <p>Of course, sceptics argue that five years ago droughts forced the water industry to consider piping water to eastern parts of Britain which were suffering severe shortages. Wait another five years and droughts will be back, they say. </p> <p>But a growing body of scientific evidence, culminating last Wednesday in a detailed European Commission report, suggests the effects in Britain of global warming will mean more sustained bursts of intense rainfall. So what are we going to do about it and how much will it cost? </p> <p>The Government's first move will be to restrict the building of new homes on flood plains. Possibly too little, too late. </p> <p>The Environment Agency (EA), which claims it is \u00a3100m million a year underfunded, says that there are 1.8m homes and 135,000 commercial premises in Britain built on flood plains. These are worth \u00a335 billion and were built mainly in the Seventies and Eighties. Of the four million new homes likely to be built by 2016, it is estimated that a quarter are zoned for flood plains. </p> <p>For example, up to 20,000 new homes are planned south-east of Ashford, Kent, close to the River Stour. This is an attractive location, but pressure is already on to get those homes shifted away from what is a hazardous area. </p> <p>'When I saw the site, I thought, \"Bloody hell, that's the last thing we want\",' said Geoff Mance, director of water management at the EA. In addition, many of the 33,000 homes that are planned in Sussex could be at risk. </p> <p>But a new planning policy guidance note from the Department of the Environment, likely to be issued within four months, will not ban flood plain development outright. Housebuilders have successfully argued that this would force up the price of land in risk-free areas at a time when the housing market has been rocketing for four years. In addition, pressure for new homes is intense, particularly in the flood-risk area of the South East. </p> <p>'A permanent ban of flood plain development might inhibit long-term alleviation methods,' argued Roger Lewis, director of the Berkeley Group, a leading housebuilder. Suggested 'alleviation methods' centre on the design of homes. These include the use of masonry walls instead of plasterboard which is cheaper but turns to mush when flooded. </p> <p>Homes may also have to use ground floors as storage space and lofts as living space. This will also offer better heat efficiency. Suspended floors allowing water to flood harmlessly under homes are also suggested. </p> <p>All new housing developments may soon have porous pavements and drives allowing rainwater to escape. Balancing ponds, which effectively catch rainwater, are increasingly a landscaped feature in new developments. </p> <p>'These techniques all make sense but they will add over \u00a310,000 to the price of an average house. It is a question of how much of this builders will pass on to the end-user,' said one senior executive of a mass volume housebuilder. </p> <p>'The trouble is we can't be totally sure that this intense weather is here to stay. What will force our hand is if insurers put premiums out of the reach of housebuilders unless we adopt these measures.' </p> <p>If new construction methods cost \u00a310,000 a house, a rough cost to housebuilders would be \u00a31.5bn a year, since there are more than 150,000 new homes built each year. </p> <p>For offices, particularly converted warehouses by rivers, the agency suggests placing canteens, meeting rooms or reception on the ground floor and basement. </p> <p>'Telephone switchboards, boilers and computers should be upstairs,' said the EA's Mance. 'We're trying to get the Government to include these suggestions in new building regulations. The idea is that if a business gets flooded it can start up again quickly.' </p> <p>The real battle to be fought, though, is to ensure that Britain's coasts and rivers have strong enough defences to withstand intense rainfall without compromising the environment. </p> <p>Today, \u00a3250m a year is spent on flood defence by the EA, which is funded by local councils as well as the Government. Despite a \u00a310m increase for three years starting next year, the agency is still underfunded. This is mainly because local authorities do not always pay into EA's pot. </p> <p>Flood Minister Elliot Morley said the situation was particularly bad in the South West: 'The Government is considering ring-fencing local authority money for flood defence.' </p> <p>The technology to counter flooding has not really changed for centuries: flood walls made either from concrete or soil are the main weapon. These suffer from seepage if not maintained and concrete walls also damage water ecology. </p> <p>To control water levels on rivers, sluices or low-lying dams are used to keep water back. But this can cause a build-up of water upstream. </p> <p>Similar methods are used to protect our coasts with defences generally made of sand or shingle. These will have to be taller. Creating beaches, which help to dissipate the effects of high tides, may have to be considered. </p> <p>'It's impossible to say how much the creating of new flood walls and their maintenance will cost,' said Terry Oakes, a leading independent consultant in water management. 'The industry has been pressing the Government for more money for a number of years. The new money announced in the Comprehensive Spending Review is not sufficient and there is a 12-month lead time. </p> <p>'Ministers' top priority is to prevent loss of life rather than avoiding flooding in the first place.' </p> <p>Britain's sewerage system - also the means by which urban floodwater is drained - is the responsibility of the privatised water industry and in need of urgent overhaul. Many sewers are more than 100 years old and will cost tens of millions to upgrade. </p> <p>To ensure Britain's rail network does not grind to a halt following strong winds and flooding would cost billions of pounds. Apart from unacceptable amounts of tree clearance, wholesale rewiring of the electrified network would be needed. This is out of the question. </p> <p>Instead, basic measures to shore up overhead rail cables in vulnerable areas, particularly on the East Coast mainline which is said to have been built on the cheap, would cost about \u00a320m, say transport experts. </p> <p>Critics say the road network has clearly been unable to cope with the weather of the last three weeks. Major roads built recently should have had drainage suction pumps underneath but these have been cut to save money. In any case, some roads with them failed to drain in last week's crisis. One transport expert said a suction pump that failed last week on London's North Circular Road had been checked just six weeks ago. </p> <p>Meanwhile, local authorities, starved of cash, have not been able to invest in suction-tank lorries. 'Where are these lorries?' said one South West councillor. 'We haven't got one. It's a legacy of the relentless financial pressure we're under. We can't justify servicing a machine we may only use once every 10 years.' </p> <p>If, despite the wringing of hands and purposeful Government rhetoric, there isn't even the cash for the occasional lorry, what chance is there of any other remedies? </p> <p><strong>Stormy weather - counting the cost of the deluge</strong></p> <p> * Last week's flood, which has swamped more than 3,000 homes, is now more extensive than the great flood of 1947 - the most devastating of recent times - when 750,000 acres were affected </p> <p>* The Meteorological Office has indicated that the UK is likely to face more intense storms </p> <p>* Insurance premiums may rise in flood-risk areas </p> <p>* Insurers have warned that householders in high-risk areas may be refused cover unless flood measures are implemented </p> <p>* Weather-related claims cost the insurance industry \u00a3860m last year </p> <p>* The insurance bill for this storm is estimated at \u00a3500m </p> <p>* Train operators are losing \u00a32m a day in income from fewer travellers and compensation payouts </p> <p>* Five million people live in flood-risk areas in England and Wales </p> <p>* Before the recent deluge 25 people in the UK had died in 30 separate flooding incidents during the past two years </p> <p>* The Environment Agency's Floodline is 0845 9881188</p>",
  "<p> 'I think the world, for far too long, has simply treated this issue of climate change as not sufficiently important - well that's no longer an option,' Prime Minister Tony Blair said last Thursday when touring inundated Bewdley in Worcestershire. </p> <p>To attack the causes of climate change caused by global warming, Blair may well want to focus on the main cause of it - Britain's 23 million houses. </p> <p>Half of greenhouse gas emissions are caused by heat escaping from homes. Emissions from car exhausts, although rising, only account for a quarter of greenhouse gases with industrial processes taking in the remaining quarter. </p> <p>Existing building regulations on construction processes have gone some way to ensuring that new homes in Britain are more energy efficient. But the Government is considering toughening these laws for new build and existing stock. A consultation period for the construction industry has recently finished. </p> <p>It is the UK's older homes, some 95 per cent of all houses, which are the prime greenhouse gas culprit. </p> <p>Architects and engineers are well aware of the need for change. </p> <p>But to convince householders to pay for more efficient boilers, insulation and double glazing is problematic. </p> <p>However, if the causes of global warming are to be addressed, a large-scale energy efficiency programme will have to be introduced. </p> <p>The Government has two main options. The best one appears to be forcing mortgage providers to include heat efficiency as part of the surveying process when a home comes up for sale. It is then open to debate as to who should pay for insulation or boiler replacement work. </p> <p>The other option is to order the equivalent of heat-efficiency MoTs once every four years. The problem here is that of stipulating how much money should be spent by homeowners to meet minimum standards. </p> <p>An ultimate environmental wishlist for conversion of an old home into an energy-efficient one could cost up to \u00a323,000, according to Professor Max Fordham, one of the country's leading building engineers specialising in heating, air conditioning, water supply and electrical installations. </p> <p>It would involve adding insulation to walls, building double-glazed sash windows with insulation shutters and installing and storing an energy system derived from natural light plus a range of efficient mod cons. </p> <p>'A fuel saving of say \u00a3500 per year for an outlay of \u00a323,000 is hardly a good deal,' said Fordham. 'But allowing our species to exhaust its habitat and decline in chaos cannot be described as a good financial deal either.'</p>",
  "<p>Estate agents say the property market is about 'location, location, location'. Business people may be concerned with the commuting distance between work and home. Young families consider schools. </p> <p>But for some people, ethereal influences and divination - the art of discovering future or unknown events - are seen as major forces when making decisions to buy or sell a home, even though such practices are less than rational. </p> <p>Spiritual consultants are available in person, by telephone and now online to give readings and charts which are then interpreted as advice or guidance. </p> <p>Feng shui, the Chinese belief in the importance of where things are placed, has become very popular in Britain over the past few years. It involves choosing and altering your environment to maximise your 'chi', or wellbeing. </p> <p>According to leading consultant and the author of Quick Feng Shui Cures , Sarah Shurety, there are many ways of establishing whether a property and its immediate vicinity are conducive to an individual's harmony and this has to do with the vibration of an area supporting their particular 'chi'. </p> <p>You should start by exploring the feel of a neighbourhood, looking out for negative signs such as dead animals on the road or people being less than friendly when asked for directions. On entering a house, the estate agent's key should turn smoothly in the lock and the lavatory should never be positioned opposite the front door. </p> <p>It is apparently not only the way in which the house is designed and decorated that can affect your future happiness but fundamental issues such as the property's history, its position in relation to the sun and the wind, the amount of greenery surrounding it, its proximity to water as well as the time and geographical direction of your actual move. The list of dos and don'ts is long and a good place to start is at <a href=\"http://www.fengshuisite.com\">www.fengshuisite.com</a> followed by a consultation relating specifically to you and your property. </p> <p>Panchang is the Indian alternative with origins from 4,000 BC. This system uses the exact position of the Moon, the planets and zodiac signs at the time and place of birth to formulate a chart. </p> <p>Panchang is a way for the individual to use timing to their advantage by, for example, calculating the best time to buy and sell property. Sam Chaffey consulted Michael Geary, a Panchang astro-loger, about her move from Devon. </p> <p>Sam explained: \"The property in Devon had slipped into negative equity and was proving impossible to sell. I was distraught at the prospect of not being able to move. However, Michael suggested an auspicious time to put the house on the market, and within the week we had found a buyer at the original asking price.' The sale went without a hitch. </p> <p>According to Geary, timing is the key to success. 'For example,' he said, 'I advised one person on her house move recently. Her consultation suggested that she postpone putting the house on the market for a few weeks. She did so and the sale finalised at 40 per cent above the original asking price.' </p> <p>But so too have a lot of house sales in the past year or so. This particular divination is available at <a href=\"http://www.panchang.com,\">www.panchang.com,</a> where it claims to be able to 'ease the stress' of a house move. </p> <p>The origins of tarot are uncertain, although it seems to have started as a card game handed down by gypsies travelling through Europe in the thirteenth century. Tarot readings are a selection of picture cards picked from a pack of 72 which allude to the fortune of the person asking a specific question. </p> <p>Catriona was considering a move out of London to a cottage in Tyttenhanger, near St Albans. The reasons for moving to this area included an easy commute, good schools and the benefits of country living. The property seemed perfect. 'It had loads of character, was beautifully decorated and backed on to open fields,' she said. But at \u00a3275,000 it was more than their budget allowed so they put in an offer of \u00a3260,000 which was turned down. </p> <p>Catriona first consulted her tarot reader on whether the move to St Albans was auspicious. The reader used a three-card spread as follows: the Three of Cups showed a happy group, seen as Catriona and her family. The second revealed the Hierophant, a card with strong religious overtones and therefore relevant to the city of St Albans. The third card represents the answer to the question asked, and in this case was the Hermit interpreted as Catriona's isolation if she left London. </p> <p>The process was repeated asking whether Catriona should move to Tyttenhanger. The Hermit came up again as the first card which reinforced the tarot reader's concerns. The Ace of Pentacles related to the area and the outcome was the Five of Cups, a card of regret which pictured three cups having fallen down. In view of the previous reading, the tarot reader felt that this was very worrying and advised caution. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the property was under offer twice from other buyers, but these potential deals fell through before Catriona spotted it advertised at a lower price. The cards were consulted again, this time with the actual cottage in mind to decide on whether Catriona should put in another offer. </p> <p>The third tarot card in the reading showed the King of Cups whose throne is floating on water which greatly troubled the reader; a definite sign of unstable foundations. Catriona pressed the estate agent for further details as to why the house sale appeared to be so problematic. It was revealed that a property developer had bought the land behind the cottage and, rather than surrounding themselves with open fields, Catriona and her family could have found themselves on a housing estate. They decided to stay in London. 'I will always consult the tarot,' says Catriona. 'But it's only relevant if you are going to act on it.' </p> <p>The tarot reader explained that often the symbolism depicted on the card only served to strengthen convictions which you had already. 'It's all about interpretation and often it can make you feel as though fortune is smiling on you,' she says. </p> <p>There are other divinations you can consult when considering a move. Like Panchang, astrology, or the zodiac as we see it in horoscopes, usually relates to the time and place of your birth. </p> <p>An astrological chart is drawn up focusing on birth as the most important symbolic time of life. From this, natal astrology dictates whether it is the right time to buy, sell or move, according to your individual chart. Horary astrology depends on the time at which a particular decision is made as to whether or not it is fortuitous. For example, an offer has been made on my flat, should I accept it? </p> <p>Electional astrology makes it possible to elect a specific time to do something. For instance, completing on a certain date at a certain time although you would have to find an understanding solicitor to comply with this. Obviously, a combination of all three types of astrology is used to give a more detailed response to various questions and dilemmas. </p> <p>Patricia, an astrologer advised her client who was considering a move from a flat to a larger property in a more affordable area to wait as something much closer to home seemed to be symbolised in her chart. Soon after wards, the flat below came up for sale offering the possibility of a cheap conversion and a less costly move while staying in the same area. </p> <p>Numerology gives individuals a life path number which is reached by a calculation involving date of birth. House numbers come into play by suggesting a mood for the house which is or is not compatible with the life path number of its occupant. </p> <p>Vaastu shastra is similar to feng shui and concentrates on the flow of energy through your body and your surroundings. </p> <p>So next time you are gazing through an estate agent's window and you think you might fancy a change, think about where the house is positioned with regard to the elements and consider the time at which your birth dictates you should move. </p> <p>Consult the tarot cards and beware the unlucky Hanged Man, and finally, if your life path number is four, don't even think of moving into number 57 because, among other things, you'd have to paint it violet to restore the karma and secure happy, fruitful relationships.</p>",
  "Scientists have put a date to Armageddon. It will occur on 21 September 2030, when earth is in danger of being hit by an asteroid. <p>The newly discovered threat to global civilisation is called 2000 SG344, and it could strike our planet with a force 100 times greater than that released by the atom bomb that destroyed Hiroshima, astronomers have calculated. </p> <p>Their announcement, posted yesterday on the internet by the International Astronomical Union, is the first formal public prediction of a potential collision with a piece of cosmic debris and it arises from a scientific review process designed to eliminate premature predictions of celestial calamities. </p> <p>Two years ago, asteroid watchers triggered worldwide alarm by announcing that a mile-wide asteroid called XF-11 might hit earth in 2028. A few days later they had to withdraw the forecast, after calculations showed the object posed no danger to our planet. </p> <p>The new prediction is unlikely to be withdrawn, however - for it has been carefully duplicated by scientists at several research centres. The object was recently discovered trailing in Earth's orbit around the sun by astronomers using the 3.6-metre Canada-France-Hawaii telescope on the island of Hawaii. </p> <p>However, the probability that it might hit Earth in 2030 was not realised until last week when Paul Chodas, at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, began studying its orbit. There was a small but definite risk, about one in 500, that its orbit, and Earth's, might coincide on 21 September 2030 - a danger that has been verified over the past 72 hours by a group of International Astronomical Union experts in Italy, Finland and the US. </p> <p>'This is a first for us,' said space scientist David Morrison at Nasa's Ames Research Center, chairman of the Astronomical Union committee. 'We have never before had a prediction at this high level of probability. In the past we have talked about 1 in 10,000 or 1 in a million.' </p> <p>On a newly devised 10-point scale for grading potential impact hazards, known as the Torino scale, the object gets a rating of only 1 - mainly because of its relatively small size and uncertain chances of striking Earth. Any rating on the Torino scale means an object merits careful monitoring. This is the first astronomical object to be given full, formal designation on the Torino scale. </p> <p>In revealing their concerns, astronomers are walking a delicate tightrope between prudent secrecy and disclosure, balancing possible ridicule against the demands of public responsibility. The danger of having to make an embarrassing withdrawal about their claim is low, however, thanks to the quick action of the the technical review panel which has confirmed Chodas's calculations, and by the careful conservative language used in their announcement. </p> <p>It is quite possible, say the astronomers, that SG344 may prove to be nothing more than a discarded Saturn rocket booster, lost in space since the days of the Apollo moon programme. Nasa records show that nine Saturn V rockets were launched toward the moon in the Apollo programme. In each case, spent rocket boosters ended up in uncharted orbits around the sun. If SG344 was to turn out to be one of these, it would simply burn up on entering our atmosphere. </p> <p>'It could be an old rocket we sent up to launch a satellite decades ago that has come back to haunt us,' said Brian Marsden, director of the Minor Planets Center at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in Cambridge. 'At least, we can't exclude the possibility.' </p> <p>However, most experts believe the SG344 is most probably an asteroid - with a diameter of between 100 and 230 feet, the size of an office block. If such an object were to hit Earth, the consequences would be severe, though not globally devastating. </p> <p>If made of stone and iron, as are many asteroids and meteorites, SG344 would explode with an estimated energy of two megatons, But if it was a loose conglomeration of stones and gravel, as several experts believe may the case, it might easily disintegrate as it skims into the atmosphere. </p> <p>Unfortunately, not enough is known about the asteroid. 'That is our problem - we don't know what it is,\" said Donald Yeomans, manager of Nasa's Near Earth Object Program office at JPL. 'All we know is how bright it appears to be, and so we have to guess to come up with a diameter.' </p> <p>It is thought that there are more than 100,000 asteroids of the estimated size of SG344 scattered around the solar system. A few approach the Earth, and on average one strikes our planet every 100 years, the last resulting in the 20-megaton blast that levelled 700 square miles of forests of central Siberia in 1908, the Tunguska explosion. A blast like that in a heavily developed area - California or Japan - could result in millions of deaths. </p> <p>In the next few months, astronomers will try to gather more data about SG344 in a bid to learn more about its orbit and to determine more accurately its chances of hitting earth - though they have had little success so far. </p> <p>Future observations may yield better data, however, allowing scientists to predict more accurately its chances of striking earth. </p> <p>But the object is slowly moving away from us, which means astronomers have only a short time to gather more data and so refine their orbital calculations. If they fail, they will have to wait until 2028, when SG344 comes into range again. </p> <p>In such circumstances, earth will have very little time to act if it turns out that the asteroid is doomed to collide with us. </p> <p>\"My own feeling is that an object this small would not be worth a great effort to deflect it, even if it is on course toward Earth,' added David Morrison. </p> <p>'I don't see an argument for any sort of crash effort.' </p> <p>It remains to be seen if people agree in 2030. </p> <p><br><b>...it happened before: </b> our planet is struck regularly by objects crashing down on us from outer space. The best recorded of these events occurred in 1908 when a small asteroid, about 300 feet in diameter, exploded high above the Tunguska River valley in Siberia, producing a brilliant blue fireball that knocked people off their feet 40 miles away, and flattened millions of trees.</p>",
  "<p>Microsoft boss Bill Gates has renounced the machine that has made him the world's richest man. In a startling proclamation, Gates has announced that computers can do little to solve the planet's gravest social ills. </p> <p>'The world's poorest two billion people desperately need healthcare, not laptops,' he said. </p> <p>The declaration represents a major personal transformation for Gates, and has sent shockwaves through America's high-tech business community. Had the Pope renounced Catholicism, the surprise would not have been greater. </p> <p>Speaking in Seattle at a conference on using computers to help the Third World, Gates said he still had faith in the ideal that technology could bring about a better world, but added that he doubted that computers - or global capitalism - could solve the most immediate catastrophes facing the world's poorest people. </p> <p>People who thought that developing countries could benefit from the e-economy had no idea what it meant to live on $1 a day with no electricity, said Gates. 'You're just buying food; you're trying to stay alive.' </p> <p>The billionaire technologist became positively vitriolic about the idea of using computers in the Third World: 'Mothers are going to walk right up to that computer and say, \"My children are dying, what can you do?\" They're not going to sit there and, like, browse eBay or something. </p> <p>'What they want is for their children to live. Do you really have to put in computers to figure that out?' </p> <p>For a man who has benefited more than anyone from the IT revolution, this reappraisal is extraordinary and comes after several months of growing disillusionment in Gates about the state of the planet, and the potential for technology to help it out of its current crisis. </p> <p>He confessed he had been 'naive - very naive' when he began giving away his fortune six years ago. At that time, he said, he expected that computers and information technology would make up the bulk of his philanthropic donations. 'Computers are amazing in what they can do, but they have to be put into the perspective of human values,' he said. </p> <p>Having visited Africa and other Third World countries his priorities had now shifted, he said. At least two-thirds of the grants offered by the $21 billion Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation would now be devoted to Third World healthcare and the development and distribution of vaccines. </p> <p>In the past year the Gates Foundation has given more than $200 million to health-related causes, including $25m for the International Aids Vaccine Initiative, $50m to prevent maternal and child mortality, $20m for international family planning efforts and $100m towards children's vaccines. 'As a father of two children, thinking about the medicines that I take for granted which are not available elsewhere, that sort of rises to the top of the list.' </p> <p>These remarks have angered many of Gates's wealthy, hi-tech philanthropist counterparts. They say he has unfairly placed computers at odds with providing food and healthcare in developing countries. Others argue that Gates is wrong to think that technology cannot help improve even the poorest people's lives. </p> <p>'After listening to three days of serious analysis and work, and then to have Gates rather flippantly say, \"You've got to have clean water and food\" - that wasn't exactly furthering the point of the entire meeting,' said Sun Microsystems chief research officer John Gage, who heads Netday, a charity committed to wiring the world's classrooms to the internet.</p>",
  "<p>The hapless citizen had only one concern: the state of the weather. Why were we having gales and storms, he wanted to know? Could they possibly be due to the impiety of the nation? </p> <p>The questions were of such pressing concern that the poor amateur meteorologist carefully carved them on a lead tablet - and then deposited it at a Roman oracle 2,400 years ago. </p> <p>The answer, unfortunately, is not recorded. Only the tablet has been recovered. Yet the questions it posed are intriguing - for they suggest that humans have always thought the weather is odd, and that we tend to blame its quirks on our own behaviour. </p> <p>Two millennia ago, bungled sacrifices, strange omens and sin among senators took the rap for floods and downpours. Today we have a different scapegoat: the carbon dioxide that is pouring from our factories and power stations. This is the new weather bogeyman, the climatic culprit responsible for last week's storms that deluged Shrewsbury, York, and Worcester; blocked rail lines and roads; and ruined thousands of houses with rising flood water. </p> <p>'Carbon dioxide emissions are the main drivers of climate change,' announced Environment Secretary Michael Meacher. 'We should greatly speed up our shift from fossil fuels to renewable sources of energy.' But not every scientist is convinced about this neat connection between storm and industry. One increasingly vociferous group has started to argue that many climatologists have failed to take proper account of a key aspect of the problem: the behaviour of our climate in prehistoric times. </p> <p>'If you take a deeper, geological perspective, you have to consider another culprit - the last Ice Age,' said geographer Dr David Evans, of Glasgow University. 'Most current climate studies fail to do this.' </p> <p>The last full Ice Age ended more than 10,000 years ago, though the planet is still visited by lesser periods of cooling - the most recent being the Little Ice Age that began during the late sixteenth century and which did not end until the early years of the twentieth. During the Little Ice Age's most intense periods, Ethiopia was regularly struck by blizzards and crops frequently failed across Europe while Britain was frequently affected by Arctic weather. </p> <p>For example, on New Year's Day 1684, John Evelyn recorded that the Thames was frozen over so thickly 'as to beare not onely streetes of boothes in which they roasted meates and had divers shops of wares quite acrosse as in a towne but coaches, carts and horses passed over'. </p> <p>The Severn Estuary and the Wash also iced over while the resulting agricultural devastation wrecked the Scottish economy, contributing - some say - to the country's decision to agree to the Union of Parliaments in 1707 (though bribery by the perfidious English was also involved). </p> <p>The little ice age was almost certainly caused by a change in the sun's activity, researchers now believe. Solar radiation continuously batters the upper atmosphere and warms it. However, the sun's output fluctuates in a series of cycles, and when several of these cycles coincide, solar radiation can rise or drop dramatically. When that happens, the planet will heat up, or cool down. Importantly, from the seventeenth to nineteenth centuries, astronomers recorded very few sunspots, while the Northern Lights were rarely seen - indicating that solar activity was low at this time, and that our climate would have been chilled. </p> <p>'The more closely we look at the Little Ice Age, the earlier it seems to have started and the later it appears to have finished,' added Evans. </p> <p>'In Iceland, glaciers were still around their maximum size in the early years of the twentieth century, and have only been shrinking since then. Those shrinking ice sheets has nothing to do with CO 2 levels and everything to do with the end of the Little Ice Age, I believe.' </p> <p>Scientists have been able to study past climates by analysing samples of ancient, buried ice. From these, they conclude that over the past two million years little Ice Ages have been followed by aftermaths that were rarely marked by calm, gradual rises in global temperatures, but were instead disfigured with jagged fluctuations in weather, just like the ones that are now being experienced. </p> <p>'Ancient climate records suggest one thing about the last century's weather patterns - that they are very similar and that there is therefore little evidence to support the idea that human activities, particularly those involving carbon dioxide production, have been affecting matters very much,' added Evans. </p> <p>'That does not mean they will not do so in future.' </p> <p>The issue is not about global warming, of course. No one doubts that it is occurring. The Arctic is estimated to have warmed by up to 6 C over the past 30 years, while its ice covering has dropped from 10ft to 6ft. Similarly, weather patterns have become more and more extreme, from tornadoes to droughts, and from floods to heatwaves. </p> <p>Nor is there any dispute that carbon dioxide levels have risen. Records show they have increased from 280 parts per million to 360 over the past two centuries. </p> <p>But is this increased carbon dioxide, trapping more and more sunlight, causing the planet to overheat - and if so, is it the cause of global warming? </p> <p>The climate gainsayers think not. 'I simply don't accept that humans are solely responsible for global warming,' said Professor John Lowe, of Royal Holloway College, London. 'On the other hand, by pumping out more and more carbon dioxide, we are definitely modifying an already highly sensitive situation. That cannot be denied.' </p> <p>This view is backed by climate history researchers at Newcastle and Exeter universities who have studied rainfall records for the past 1,000 years by analysing the width of growth rings in cave stalagmites. These reveal a number of sustained periods of wet and stormy conditions have occurred in that period. </p> <p>'Our research suggests that British rainfall is naturally highly variable,' said geographer Dr Andy Baker, of Newcastle University. 'We have shown that nature is able to repeat current events without the help of global warming.' Nevertheless, Baker added a crucial caveat: that further increases in global temperature, 'could exaggerate the natural variations and could create even more severe bouts of flooding'. </p> <p>In other words, most of the so-called climate change that we are witnessing is the result not of rising CO 2 levels but of natural climate variation, most of it associated with the recent end of the Little Ice Age. This does not mean industrial emissions will not have an impact in future, however. </p> <p>In addition, many climatologists disagree that industrial emissions are not having an impact. 'We are now seeing really large variations in the weather,' said Dr Mike Hulme, director of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research at East Anglia University. </p> <p>'There is no way that these fluctuations are being caused only by warming after the Little Ice Age. That is quite insufficient to explain the weather changes we have seen since the 1980s. Only the input of greenhouse gases, and in particular carbon dioxide, can account for the things we have experienced recently.' </p> <p>In addition, the changes that have already been set in motion by global warming - no matter what its cause - promise to be profound. Sea levels have already risen by a foot over the past century, and will rise by a further one to three feet. For countries like Bangladesh that spells disaster. For low-level areas of Britain, it suggests some very uncomfortable times to come. </p> <p>'It will take several hundred years for sea levels to stabilise even if we could stop global warming today,' added Hulme. 'We are going to have to live with the consequences of global warming for centuries.' </p> <p>In fact, both sides agree that reducing carbon dioxide is desirable. It is just that the climate gainsayers do not urge this action with the fervour displayed by other weather experts, or by ecologists who are campaigning not just to save the environment, but to ensure developed countries alter their lifestyles. </p> <p>In other words, most agree that a few percentage cuts in carbon dioxide emissions could do wonders for our weather. </p> <p>Whether they will reduce our impiety is a different matter. </p> <p><strong>Weather myths and sober truths...</strong></p> <p><strong> Noah's Flood</strong> </p> <p> \u0095 Original scapegoat: God. </p> <p>\u0095 Real culprit: Inundation of Black Sea by Mediterranean 8,000 years ago </p> <p> <strong> Viking invasions</strong> </p> <p> \u0095 Original scapegoat: raping and pillaging instincts of Scandinavians. </p> <p>\u0095 Real culprit: exceptional warm period of climate around AD1000 helped Vikings reach Iceland, Greenland and America and settle there. </p> <p> <strong> 1815: The year without a summer</strong> </p> <p> \u0095 Original scapegoat: Day of Judgment. </p> <p>\u0095 Real culprit: Indonesia's Mount Tambora,'which exploded with the force of one billion tonnes of TNT, and coated the planet in inky dust. </p> <p> <strong> Demise of the dinosaurs</strong> </p> <p> \u0095 Original scapegoat: dinosaurs' own stupidity. </p> <p>\u0095 Real culprit: major climatic disaster, probably triggered by the impact of an asteroid.</p>",
  "<p>If the latest repeats of The Good Life have got you thinking, you're probably not the only one. More and more of us are being seduced by the idea of 'downshifting'. But whereas back in the Seventies, Tom and Barbara had only their plucky good humour, Gerry's sarcasm and a few pigs to keep them on the right path, today you can turn to all manner of career consultants and life coaches for help. It is becoming a real cottage industry. </p> <p>The term 'downshifting' first appeared in 1994. It was coined by the Trends Research Institute in New York to describe what it called 'a new renaissance philosophy' whereby high achievers at work opted for a lower salary in exchange for a richer life. According to the Henley Centre for Forecasting one in eight people in the UK would like to do something similar. </p> <p>Lea Brindle can help. Formerly a training manager with a large accountancy firm, he now mixes consultancy work with yoga teaching. 'I wouldn't say it's the good life but I do have a compost heap.' He offers would-be downshifters a 'personality audit' and the chance to explore what they really want. </p> <p>'We spend too much time worrying about the future or thinking about the past when what we need to do is live in the present,' he says. 'I try to encourage clients to think about what they like doing. Often they're stuck in repetitive career patterns. But change is hard because you need to be totally honest with yourself.' That is something that becomes harder the further up the greasy pole you've climbed. </p> <p>Andrew Ferguson runs Breakthrough, an organisation that helps people who want to, as he puts it, 'do the dream'. 'The barriers that people see vary,' he says. 'For people in their thir ties it's maybe the mortgage. For people in their forties, perhaps it's not wanting to give up success and for people in their fifties it's thinking they've left it too late.Pensions and children are also often mentioned.' </p> <p>The very term 'downshifting' can be a disincentive; most people who have made the move don't see themselves as moving down at all. Many prefer to talk of life-shifting. </p> <p>Mark Doughty is a personal development and organisational change consultant. The former NHS manager believes we're often working for the wrong reasons. 'We still haven't got to grips with the pace of modern life and our material expectations of it,' he says. 'We work for the carrots of status and material wealth without examining them. Neither work. The need for status reflects a lack of self-esteem, while many of the things we buy we don't need or want. Often, we're just buying stuff to prove to ourselves and others that there's some point to all the work we're doing. It's a vicious circle. People who chase money will never have enough of it.' </p> <p>That's not to say the drop in status does not create difficulties. James Green, once a campaigning project manager in the voluntary sector, is a part-time library assistant. 'I sometimes feel awkward telling people what I do now and it can be embarrassing when someone suggests going for a meal or some other potentially expensive night out.' </p> <p>However, as Green points out, you need a degree of status to downshift in the first place. 'It's a middle-class option,' he says. 'You can't do it if you're struggling on what you've got and if you've never had a new house or a new car it's far harder to give up on those dreams. Having friends and family who are better-off also helps. My CD player, TV, video and computer are all cast-offs. I still wear clothes from Next and The Gap - I just get mine from the Oxfam shop.' The traditional reasons for staying in a job - security, promotion, pensions - have been shot out of the water in the past two decades. 'Dropping out used to be seen as lack of ambition,' says Sue Read, author of Workshift , which looks at the future of work. 'But recent shifts in employment have been so dramatic - with downsizing, job insecurity and the Rambo school of hiring and firing - that people have begun to realise that in spite of putting all their energies into a company their loyalty may not be rewarded. </p> <p>'The average shelf-life of a company today is four years. The reality is that when someone gets promotion these days, their first thought is not \"great, my career is taking off\" but \"great, now they'll have to pay me more when they sack me\".' </p> <p>Change need not be as revolutionary as self-sufficiency in Surbiton. 'I only know a couple of people who have thrown in everything and taken off,' says Read. 'Many more change their lives in an evolutionary way, making a series of smaller, manageable changes to get to where they want to be.' Rather than consumer boycotts, anti-sweatshop campaigns and demonstrations at World Trade Organisation meetings, could the biggest challenge to global corporate culture be more and more of us deciding we don't want to play any more? </p> <p> Some names have been changed.</p> <p><strong>'I enjoy the simple experience of living'</strong></p> <p>John Wilson was principal of a large adult education college. In 1985, aged 45, he moved to Cornwall where he and his wife now offer bed and breakfast and run a small publishing business. 'I enjoy the simple experience of living. I'm not always trying to do something. If it's a nice day, I'll sail my boat. If it isn't, I'll work on my business opportunities newsletter Good Ideas . </p> <p>'For years we'd wanted to move to Cornwall but kept putting it off, saying we'd do it in a couple of years. One day some friends went for a holiday so we went to see them. I fell in love with the village of Zennor near Land's End - the surrounding scenery reminded me of Scotland where I come from. Still we put it off, convincing ourselves we'd never find a house there. But six weeks later we saw an advert in The Observer. So then we told ourselves it was too soon. We weren't ready. But a friend persuaded us to look anyway. </p> <p>'As we pulled up in the village, a sea mist fell and entering the garden was like walking into an enchanted wood. The house wasn't so magical - there was no front door and it was full of rot - but when we saw it in the glorious sunshine the next day we wanted it. Nobody would give us a mortgage on the place for ages and when we did finally move we spent a year in a caravan in all weatherwhile it was being rebuilt. </p> <p>'I wouldn't pretend it's easy. Cornwall is one of the poorest parts of the country and there are a lot of people struggling but people often have more resources than they think and the quality of life - the scenery, the culture and the people - are all better than we enjoyed in London. </p> <p>'For me, it's about making the things you enjoy doing most in your life the purpose of your life. If you work from your ideal situation back to your reality and plot the steps to get there, it suddenly becomes possible. For all the ups and down, we've never once questioned whether we did the right thing.'</p>",
  "<p>About 5 million people in Britain live in homes built on flood plains - areas that the Environment Agency says are at risk of flooding. </p> <p>But far more householders than that could find their homes underwater, experiencing the misery of those affected by last week's storm, with evacuation and bills for ruined carpets, furniture and decor. Experts fear there may an even steeper cost: homes reduced in value, or even made unsaleable. </p> <p>One factor worrying the experts is the inability of a Victorian drainage system to cope with increased rainfall in ever-spreading built-up areas. At the end of the year, the Government will receive a report from the insurance industry urging a radical rethink to tackle this growing problem. </p> <p>What worries Professor Michael Clark, head of the so-called Sunami (Japanese for 'wave') working party, is the incidence of floods in places, such as Edinburgh, that are not usually regarded as vulnerable. </p> <p>'There is an increasing number of floods that aren't on the flood plain,' Clark says. 'These can be caused when there are flash floods and the drains can't cope. The drainage problem is as big a problem as river and sea defence. Ultimately, urban drainage will be seen as more of a focus of attention than building little walls around groups of houses that should never have been built in the first place.' </p> <p>The Victorians' work will have to be redone one day. Just as governments have neglected the transport infrastructure, so they seem to have neglected the sewers and drains. And just as Railtrack is now investing in safety, so local authorities will eventually have to invest in the drainage infrastructure. </p> <p>But whatever the cause of the flooding, fresh facts are starting to emerge. Insurance experts are expecting premiums to rise for building and contents cover. </p> <p>Peter Staddon of the British Insurance Brokers Association, says: 'It could be \u00a310 or \u00a320 per policy, I wouldn't be surprised to see it happen in the new year.' The exact increases are hard to work out. Falling crime figures could, he suggests, counterbalance the financial effect of greater flooding. </p> <p>Clark, who is based at Southampton University's Geodata Institute, takes a similar view: 'Because we spread the [flood element of] premiums across all policyholders, the premiums are better [than they would be otherwise for people affected]. But, if the problems continue, we will see a small increase for people living in the flood plains.' </p> <p>Insurers are almost guaranteed to push any extra costs on to the highest-risk policyholders, says Bryan Joseph, general insurance actuary at accountant PricewaterhouseCoopers: 'If insurers don't target their premium rate increases, other players will cherry-pick the good risks.' </p> <p>The outlook for people whose homes have been flooded more than once recently is difficult. The Association of British Insurers, normally eager to dismiss suggestions that people at particular risk might be unable to get cover, admits openly there is a problem. </p> <p>'In very extreme cases, it might mean excluding flood cover,' says a spokeswoman. 'In areas flooded once or twice a year, if the insurer knows that the local authority is looking at the issue, they will keep cover in place.' </p> <p>She accepts that insurers are less likely to do so if they do not believe the council involved will find a solution. </p> <p>A Norwich Union spokeswoman says: 'If someone has had their property flooded two or three times in the last two or three years, then premiums could go up to reflect the risk.' </p> <p>Looking longer term, new ways of dealing with the problems caused by flood, storm and insufficient drainage will have to be found. There are two main financial aspects to the problem: the cost of damage repair and insurance; and the effect on house prices. </p> <p>On the cost of repair, the Sunami working party has discovered that the UK is 'unique' in relying totally on the commercial sector and in having no financial input from government. The case for a contingency fund for disasters is one issue it will raise with the Government. </p> <p>Clark says other possibilities include putting 'the onus of flood defence on to individual properties'.This would mean that homes in flood plains would follow the example of the Netherlands, which builds them with raised, waterproof doors, air bricks that shut and other features that resist water. </p> <p>The Housing Minister, Nick Raynsford, is interested in this approach. </p> <p>He is pushing another development that could help: the publication of draft planning guidelines that encourage property developers and local authorities to consult insurers, lenders and other interested parties before new sites are built on. This would be particularly important when discussing the massive new house-building programme that the Government says is needed. </p> <p>Homes in areas that are flooded regularly could be worth less or, in extreme cases, become unsaleable, say experts. This would affect the residents of places hit badly last week, such as Yalding in Kent,and Lewes, East Sussex. 'I can't imagine that anyone would want to buy in Yalding,' says con veyancing solicitor Brian Marson of Marsons. </p> <p>But even people whose homes have not yet been flooded could find that the value of their home goes down because they are deemed to be a risk. </p> <p>The Environment Agency plans to publish national flood maps on its website by the end of the year at the latest. This will provide a free analysis of the flooding risk for every postcode in England and Wales. A similar system is already freely available to individuals through the Homecheck website. </p> <p>'This sort of system will impact on property value,' says Brendan Doyle of Homecheck. 'Surveyors and lawyers will have to become skilled at interpreting that information.' </p> <p>Buyers should be warned that many solicitors do not undertake this sort of check for conveyancing clients now, so potential problems can remain hidden. </p> <p>But, as more solicitors become familiar with the need to check for flood and other environmental risks, so the problems in more houses will become more obvious to potential buyers. It could be that disclosure is made compulsory , just as an analysis of earthquake and other hazards is required when people buy and sell homes in California.</p> <p><strong>How to wring out the cash for repairs</strong></p> <p>1 Ring your insurer or broker quickly to agree a plan of action. They usually prefer to send repairers and buy replacement items themselves. </p> <p>2 Don't throw out sodden carpets or other damaged items before your insurer's loss adjuster examines them.</p> <p>3 Take photographs or a video of the damage while the water is in the house as extra evidence.</p> <p>4 Expect to be rehoused in a hotel for a few days if the damage is mild; in a rented house if the repairs will take weeks or months. The insurer should pay.</p> <p>5 Contact your motor insurer if you have comprehensive cover and your car has been damaged by the water or a storm. If you are only covered for third party, fire and theft, you cannot claim.</p> <p>6 Don't expect to be reimbursed for repairs if your fence suffers storm damage. Most policies exclude such commonplace items, though some pay out for damage caused by a falling tree.</p> <p>7 Plan to stay with your existing insurer if you are making a claim now. It will be easier administratively to stay put while your claim is sorted out. Premiums may be higher with other firms once you have experienced flood or storm damage. </p> <p><strong>More information</strong></p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.environment-agency.org.uk\">www.environment-agency.org.uk</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.homecheck.co.uk\">www.homecheck.co.uk</a></p> <p>National Floodline: 0845-988 1888</p>"
