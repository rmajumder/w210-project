  "<p>Carlton Interactive, the interactive development arm of Carlton Communications, has appointed design agency Attik to develop a raft of new programme-oriented websites. </p> <p>The first site, <a href=\"http://www.carlton.com/babybaby\" target=\"_NEW\">Carlton.com/babybaby</a>, went live on Tuesday as an accompaniment to Carlton's new daytime TV series, Baby Baby. Two more sites are in development and plan to launch within the next few months. </p> <p>The Baby Baby site, which is aimed at young mothers and grandmothers, offers practical advice to pregnant women and those with young children. The site has links to <a href=\"http://www.webbaby.co.uk/\" target=\"_NEW\">Webbaby.co.uk</a>, which sponsors the TV series, and also features presenter Melinda Messenger.</p> <p>Steve Aston, marketing director at the website's developer, Attik UK, said: \"The website is a valuable extension of the Baby Baby series and is a good example of how broadcasters can give added value and information to viewers through interactive channels. At Attik we felt it was important that the online brand captured the fun, insightful personality of the show.\"</p> <p>Attik is a global multi-platform agency that specialises in design and strategy based in Huddersfield, London, New York, San Francisco and Sydney.</p>",
  "As the street violence subsides, some of the fire and brimstone is also ebbing from the regional coverage of events. <a href=\"http://www.jrtv.com\" target=\"_new\">Jordan state radio and TV</a>, for example, is reporting the shaky ceasefire dispassionately, noting that Israel has ordered its troops where possible to avoid lethal action. <p>The <a href=\"http://www.gulf-times.com\" target=\"_new\">Gulf Times</a>, in Qatar, leads with the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, warning of difficult days ahead, \"days of fire and of fighting\". The paper looks ahead to the weekend summit of Arab nations in Cairo, only the second such meeting since the Gulf War of 1991. Eighteen out of 22 member states of the Arab League have said they will attend. In its comment columns, the paper notes that Israeli agents have snatched eight men allegedly responsible for the Ramallah lynchings last week, and notes caustically: \"If the report is true, the Palestinian people will be asking their leaders what action is to be taken against Israeli soldiers and settlers who have gunned down so many people, particularly those who have murdered Palestinian children.\" </p> <p>The Palestinian <a href=\"http://www.pna.org/mininfo\" target=\"_new\">Ministry of Information</a>, in its daily roundup of the local press, also chides the Western media for implying there is a conflict between equals: \"Western media, journalists and diplomats are cheating their people and misleading their audiences. It is time for them to show the picture as it is, a Palestinian unarmed population confronting a huge military power occupying the Palestinian land with stones.\" </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.khaleejtimes.com/\" target=\"_new\">Khaleej Times</a>, in the United Arab Emirates, has an interesting look at the American view of the region in the aftermath of the suicide attack on the destroyer Dole, which killed 19 sailors. The paper says that many US commentators assume the region is infected with pathological anti-Americanism. It notes drily: \"Rare is the American analyst who tries to understand the theory of relativity that governs political perceptions, meaning that what may seem like an even-handed peace accord to an ordinary American Joe may look extremely discriminatory to a Palestinian living in occupied Jerusalem.\" </p> <p>Arab diplomatic moves also feature strongly in the <a href=\"http://www.jordantimes.com\" target=\"_news\">Jordan Times</a>, which looks ahead to a potentially significant visit to Amman by the Syrian president, Bashar Assad. Jordan's relations with its northern neighbour were at a low ebb through much of the 1990s, with Bashar's despotic father and predecessor, Hafez, bitterly critical of King Hussein's policy of rapprochement with Israel. Now both countries have new rulers, and the paper notes that King Abdullah has already made several visits to Damascus. Both leaders, it says, \"have managed to develop a cosy relationship in the past several months, are free from the past sensitivities that marked the often tense ties between the two countries and are committed to improving their national economies and the standard of living of their peoples in the era of globalisation.\" </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.amin.org\" target=\"_new\">Arab Media Internet Network </a>has an analysis by Daoud Kuttab, one of the shrewdest Palestinian commentators, in which he talks of Israel's three million Arab hostages. He argues that the \"closure\" which prevents Palestinian movement within the occupied territories, as well as across the border with Israel, is actually fuelling their demands for a separate state: \"The way that Barak tried to make political gains out of lifting the blockade produced an angry response. </p> <p>\"Discussions in homes often centred on the absurdity of the situation. People commented on how Israel places a blockade and then begins negotiations with the Palestinians on what it will get in return for lifting this blockade. Such absolute disregard for a civilian population is not much different than their release for money. The difference is that this time three million people are held hostage by a country, which claims to be a democracy.\" </p> <p>In Israel, the <a href=\"http://www.jpost.com\" target=\"_new\">Jerusalem Post</a> crows over the reported abduction by the Shin Bet or secret service of eight Palestinians held to have taken part in the lynching of two Israeli soldiers last week: \"Aside from the simple fact that such barbaric behaviour must not be allowed to go unpunished - although the Palestinian Authority seemed to think differently - the capture of these men once again proves that Israel still has the capability and, more importantly, the determination, to retaliate if the circumstances demand it.\" </p> <p>The liberal daily <a href=\"http://www.haaretzdaily.com\" target=\"_new\">Ha'aretz </a> is concerned about what it sees as a swell of global antisemitism: \"Two recent developments have aggravated matters. The first, a quiet and continuing trend, is the erosion of the taboo against anti-Semitism in effect since the Holocaust among elite Western European groups, particularly in Germany. The second, a more visible and forceful trend, involves the support that Arab immigrants in their new countries give to those who attack Jewish institutions.\" </p> <p>Also in Ha'aretz, veteran commentator Meron Benvenisti has a thoughtful piece about the torching of forests by Arab Israelis, as part of their violent campaign in support of the Palestinians. The arson attacks have caused outrage in Israel, but as Benvenisti points out: \"Many of the forests that were set ablaze were planted to hide the remnants of the Arab civilisation that once existed in this land - villages, cultivated fields, plantations and cemeteries. The planting of these \"camouflaging\" forests was intended to bury an important stratum in the history of this land and to ensure the burial would not be accompanied by any gravestone or marker. Those who have picnicked in the forests ... and are shocked by the attempts to set those forests ablaze, should remember they are living in the same land with people whose homes have been covered by such forests and who consider the green trees a memorial to their disaster.\"</p>",
  "The Railtrack chief executive, Gerald Corbett, is to keep his job as the company admitted today that a broken rail at the centre of the Hatfield train crash should have been replaced sooner. <p>In a statement, the firm said the failure to replace the rail \"was Railtrack's responsibility\". </p> <p>The board unanimously rejected Mr Corbett's offer to resign, saying he was the best person to lead the inquiry into Tuesday's derailment, which claimed four lives. </p> <p>The company also said its preliminary view was that a broken rail caused the crash and that the condition of the rail was \"wholly unacceptable\". </p> <p>Railtrack also revealed it had identified as many as 100 track locations \"with similar characteristics to that at the stretch of track at Hatfield\". </p> <p>Mr Corbett offered to go yesterday, saying \"I, personally, am distraught that another tragedy has occurred on our railways\". </p> <p>However, the rail industry generally welcomed the board's decision, which was announced at 6am after a six-hour meeting, which ended around midnight. </p> <p>But former British Rail senior operations manager Peter Rayner dismissed the announcement as \"a good piece of public relations\" and asked why speed restrictions had not been in place at Hatfield. </p> <p>The board met after Railtrack disclosed that the Hatfield section of line has been assessed for re-railing in January this year, with work starting in May. </p> <p>The company added in a statement that whatever the cause of the crash was, the condition of the track was \"not good\". </p> <p>It went on: \"The condition of the rail, which was only five years' old, was wholly unacceptable. </p> <p>\"The probable cause of the fracture was gauge corner cracking. The rail was due to be replaced in November. The replacement should have been in place sooner and this was Railtrack's responsibility.\" </p> <p>Four people died and 35 were injured when the Great North Eastern Railways 12.10pm London to Leeds high-speed train was derailed on Tuesday.</p> <p>The Liberal Democrat environment spokesman, Don Foster, welcomed the decision to reject Mr Corbett's resignation. He said: \"Disliking the heat in the kitchen does not always justify leaving it, especially when there is a large mess to clear up. </p> <p>\"If you look overall at safety on our railways, there is a lot of concern there, and Gerald Corbett is probably the best-placed person to help us sort these problems out.\"</p> <p>There were fears within the rail industry that Mr Corbett's resignation would do little to improve rail safety. He even attracted support from the Paddington survivors' group, which had been sharply critical of him following last year's west London train crash.</p>",
  "<p>Are you the sort of person who reaches for Kellogg's Corn Flakes rather than an indistinct own-label cereal packet on your weekly trawl round the supermarket? Would you sooner clothe yourself in Nike down the gym than some anonymous sports kit that doesn't carry that all-important swoosh? And what about your car? Is that a BMW, or VW Golf - or just any old thing that gets you from A to B? </p> <p>I'm talking brands here, those clearly-labelled, highly-defined, sophisticated products that have somehow come to mean so much more than the mere packaging and stuff they are made of. </p> <p>Brands are truly all around us. Today they can be anything from traditional FMCGs (marketing speak for \"fast moving consumer goods\" such as soap powder and baked beans) to major corporations, service companies, political parties and even people. Think Britney Spears, David Beckham and New Labour, as much as Virgin, Pepsi or BA. </p> <p>Today the V&amp;A in London is mounting a new show for three months called Brand.New, aimed specifically at scrutinising the role of brands in the early 21st century and decoding what they mean. The exhibition consists of a series of photographic case studies of global names such as Coca-Cola and Gap, lifting the lid on how these brands were established and looking at how we consumers relate to them. </p> <p>But what exactly are brands? How can they be defined? What makes the difference, say, between one unmarked pair of perfectly nice, functional trainers and a pair of gleaming, box-fresh Nikes? </p> <p>Robert Bean, chairman of leading brand consultants Banc, which has promoted such household names as the Body Shop and Covent Garden Soups, explains: \"The principal difference between an ordinary product and a brand is the intangibles beyond the product itself. A brand goes beyond functionality, it is everything around that, how it is packaged, what it looks like, what colour it is - its personality, if you like. Put simply, product plus personality equals brand\". </p> <p>Not any old thing can achieve brand status: \"Every great brand has an outstanding product feature at its heart,\" says Bean. Hence Rolex watches wouldn't be, well, Rolex watches if they didn't work rather well and look so fancy; Heinz Baked Beans wouldn't be Heinz if they didn't have a specially nice beany flavour and weren't consistently high quality. The same applies to Coca-Cola with its mystery ingredient, Rolls-Royce cars and any of the world's other leading power brands. </p> <p>A product also needs time and to be promoted and communicated consistently to become a brand. Lord Leverhume at Unilever used to claim that repetition was the key to establishing a brand name: if you bang consumers over the head with the name again and again it will penetrate and they will get the message. While being a rather unsophisticated approach there is some truth to it. </p> <p>\"In a way BMW have done this very thing over the years, consistently positioning themselves in all their marketing communications as the ultimate driving machine. Now that's given consumers a very clear understanding of what they are about,\" says Bean. </p> <p>But what really determines a brand is trust. This is why we consumers value them so highly and opt for known names and familiarly labelled goods over and above non-brands - because of the comfort element. They are, in effect, products with a \"trustmark\" rather than a mere \"trademark\". </p> <p>Dr Nick Georgiades, an industrial psychologist who has worked with BA and helped BT devise the memorable \"It's good to talk\" advertising campaign, says: \"If you see a brand as a trustmark it tells you that you have not been let down by it and that you can reduce anxiety by using it. Particularly today, in this crazy world of speed and noise and constant demands, we are all looking for a short-cut to anxiety reduction, so if you choose a trustmark you are reducing the possibility of new anxieties.\" </p> <p>Georgiades explains that trust is \"an historical concept\" and we need \"repeated interactions with associated good feelings\" to build it; indeed, branding experts suggest it takes at least three years to establish this feeling of goodwill among consumers. But we don't need to have directly experienced something ourselves. Our mums, say, might have always used Nivea face cream and now enjoy an impressively wrinkle-free old age, hence we might plump for Nivea as a result. </p> <p>Thus brands help us steer our way through the world. In a sea of consumer confusion, they are like a navigation point or a lighthouse, providing us with a sort of cultural map. </p> <p>But perhaps the most important role of all for brands, is that they help us define who we are. </p> <p>Peter York, the renowned style guru who runs his own brand consultancy SRU, says: \"Community, church or regiment don't work any more as prescribed identities, but people like to identify themselves so they make some chains of their own by choosing particular brands. They now brand themselves, with greater or lesser degrees of subtlety. They even say things like 'I'm not sure if this is right for my personal branding'.\" </p> <p>This \"personal branding\" might come in the shape of clothes and designer labels: by wearing Calvin Klein we are saying we are urban chic, for example, while Diesel suggests \"cool and edgy\". Similarly Country Casuals, Gap, and Dries van Noten all say quite different things about who we are or want to be. </p> <p>\"Cars and newspapers are particularly strong symbols or signals of what tribe we belong to and what we believe in - cars, whether they be sporty or functional or family, are a clear sign not least because most people know how much they cost so on a crude level they tell people how much money you've got,\" says Bean. </p> <p>Interestingly, the V&amp;A show includes a video installation of nine short films based around the stories of real people and their relationships with brands. One tells the tale of a taxi driver who has saved up for years to buy himself a Rolls-Royce; \"I haven't got any style but the Roller has,\" he explains. Another features a man who is very loyal to just two brands: Marks &amp; Spencer and Skoda. He proudly declares that he has had six Skodas in succession and that he buys all his clothes from M&amp;S, suggesting that this makes him a somehow better, even more interesting person than those who don't. </p> <p>Whatever happens next with brands probably depends on how deep manufacturers' pockets are. It takes time and money to build brands, but this particular marketing phenomenon is obviously here to stay. </p> <p>York sums up: \"Brands mean so much more than they did. The designer is the shaman of the 21st century - any bit that drops from him has a bit of magic about it. And the big, powerful, stretchy brands like Nike and Starbucks are also awash with promises and cultural meanings, suggesting that a little bit of their magic will rub off on you too if you use them.\"</p>",
  "<p> Don't look now but a solitary vice is taking Britain by storm: short text messaging from mobile phones. In August, 560m text messages were sent in the UK, according to the GSM (Global System for Mobile communications) Association, more than 10 times the 50m recorded in May, 1999. Worldwide , the number of short text messages sent to mobile phones this month will reach 10bn, compared with one billion only 16 months ago, according to the GSM Association. </p> <p>That works out at nearly two for every person on the planet, though most of the world's population don't have a telephone, let alone a mobile. Text messaging is now more popular than emai (currently running at 10bn posts a year), even though it is much younger as a recreational activity. The reason, presumably, is that text messages are shorter and sent more frequently from a wider user base (mobiles) than emails, which are usually transmitted from a personal computer.</p> <p> IDC, the IT research firm, predicted this week that email traffic would reach a \"staggering\" 35bn a day by 2005 If present trends continue, text messaging will be far bigger. Like it or hate it, text messaging is the fastest growing communication phenomenon of all time. And it is still in diapers. There are two interesting facts about the growth of the short messaging system (SMS) which are also shared with email. </p> <p>The first is that success was achieved with minimal spending on advertising. I'm pushed to think of a single advert urging me to SMS a friend. What happened was that supply created its own demand. Once the capacity to deliver messages instantly and cheaply was available, the message spread round the world by \"viral\" marketing, or word-of-mouth. </p> <p> Viral marketing was unintentionally invented by Netscape over six years ago when it made copies of its browser freely available over the web, a decision that led to tens of millions being down loaded within months. </p> <p> This lesson has yet to be learned by the so-called dot.com companies selling to the consumer which have crippled themselves with huge marketing costs to establish their new brands. The difference is they are selling old economy goods over the internet rather than digital products like email that are intrinsic to the web. However, this problem won't last much longer: not because dot.coms will have found a solution but because they will have stopped calling themselves dot.coms.</p> <p> They are now reinventing themselves as software engineers or providers of merchandising solutions in order to have any chance of crossing a venture capitalist's threshold before they are shown the door. Viral marketing is still booming. At last week's World Internet Summit in London, I bumped into Yossi Vardi, founder of ICQ, the hugely successful messaging company subsequently sold to AOL for $407 million. His latest venture, which speeds updownload times, has topped seven million downloads. He says he has never spent a penny on advertising. </p> <p> The second interestingfactor is what effect short messaging will have on information overload. Overload has been talked about years but it is only now starting to bite. Four years ago I wrote an article about information overload in the Guardian but I didn't know the half of it. The problem then was mainly \"static\" overload - the fact that there was so much information on the web that it was difficult to know where to start to look. </p> <p> That problem is even worse now but at least it is static - you don't need to browse if you don't want to. Static overload has always been a problem in the sense that there has always been too much information in the world to absorb. The information revolution simply brought an age-old problem to the desktop. </p> <p> But \"dynamic\" overload - the tidal wave of emails, now joined now by short messages - is different. It is aimed at your screen and demands a response - often instant - and is now threatening to become counter productive. </p> <p> Emailing quickly became a tool for competitive advantage because of the way it could cut response times, instantly disseminate information throughout the country, and cut through artificial corporate layers created by geography and bureaucracy. Now it is different. Managers are finding they can't cope with 100, even 200 emails a day: everyone in the company wants to send them a blind copy of what they are doing and outside organisations and individuals can get through to them immediately without going through the secretarial filter. Employees now send emails to colleagues sitting next to them rather than speak - so they remain on the record and aren't the victim of a memory lapse. </p> <p> It has got to the stage where busy executives have stopped opening all their emails because they simply can't. One US businessman admitted to the Wall Street Journal that he had 1,059 unopened \"carbon copy\" emails. Another confessed he had gone back to using the telephone or voice-mail because it was more personal. Communications that aren't recognisable aren't even opened. They have become a new kind of junk mail. This is a sea change, because with letters, at least you knew someone wasopening them. </p> <p> Some managers now employ more not fewer secretaries to cope with email overload. Others print them out, hoping to go through them later - a resolution that soon gets broken once a few more hundred emails have arrived. </p> <p> No one has yet found an answer to email overload, except to make sure that you answer every one you open immediately - a resolution that inevitably leads you to open fewer in the first place. What will happen when text messages - now the plaything of the younger generation - seep into corporate culture can only be guessed at. In theory, they are lethally efficient. They go straight to the person you want to reach, they are concise, and can be read in a meeting without disruption and instantaneously responded to. But they will add yet another layer to corporate overload because they will be in addition to all the emails, voice mails and letters already received. Goodness knows what will happen when executives start getting 100 short text messages a day (you will, you will) on top of everything else. </p> <p> The only sure thing is that the communications revolution will end up with less not more communication.</p>",

  "<p>BBC1 and ITV tore up the television schedules yesterday as the ratings battle between the two broadcasters intensified. </p> <p>The BBC is shifting its ailing drama Hope and Glory to Sundays, while ITV continues to shore up its schedule with careful placing of its popular game show Who Wants to be a Millionaire? </p> <p>Observers say the BBC and ITV are involved in a battle that neither can afford to lose - but both channels appear to be risking the wrath of viewers who have little idea where their favourite shows will turn up next. </p> <p>\"We are in a competitive and ruthless scheduling environment,\" said the BBC's head of scheduling, Adam MacDonald. </p> <p>The ratings war follows the BBC's decision to switch its evening news from 9pm to 10pm. The chairman of the BBC governors, Sir Christopher Bland, defended the move last night after hints from ministers that the corporation would be placed under independent regulators: \"It is a demonstration of the independence of the governors that, despite that threat, we still took what we believe to be the right decision.\" </p> <p>But Sir Robin Biggam, chairman of the independent television commission, which recently allowed ITV to move its 11pm news back to 10pm on three days a week, said the BBC had gone \"beyond the boundary of fair competition\". </p> <p>As the war of words waged last night, both broadcasters continue to employ surreptitious tactics that are more common in the United States: the latest weapon was deployed on Tuesday night, the second day of the new schedule, when ITV screened a 10-minute news special from ITN at 9pm about the Hatfield train crash. </p> <p>ITV's previous unscheduled mid-evening bulletins have been fronted by the Nightly News presenter, Dermot Murnaghan, but the crash special was introduced by Sir Trevor McDonald, who is also expected to be named soon as the anchorman for the network's revived News at 10. </p> <p>From the beginning of November, BBC1 is moving its poorly performing Lenny Henry vehicle, Hope and Glory, from Thursday to Sunday. </p> <p>After being absent for a fortnight, the ailing hospital series Holby City returns on Thursdays - but an hour later than usual to avoid taking a hammering from Millionaire. It will run head-to-head with ITV's popular new series, Fat Friends. </p> <p>The BBC is also planning to air several editions of its hit daytime quiz show, The Weakest Link, in peak time. Mr MacDonald said: \"We haven't changed our scheduling policy - it's not as if we're doing anything different from what we've always done.\" </p> <p>Figures released yesterday showed that ITV's news special drew 8.5m viewers on Tuesday, far more than used to watch the BBC Nine O'Clock News. It was, however, boosted by its position between The Bill and A Touch of Frost. </p> <p>BBC1's premiere of the sci-fi comedy blockbuster Men in Black drew an average audience of 9.8m on Tuesday, against 7.5m for Frost. The BBC's new Ten O'Clock News continued to build its audience with 6.1m, almost a million up on the average for the old 9pm news. Provisional figures also showed the BBC dominated the 6.30pm to 10.30pm peak time period with 37.5% of viewers against ITV's 33.4%. </p> <p>As the two principal networks slug it out, BBC2, Channel 4 and Channel 5 are all being squeezed. </p> <p><strong>The fight for viewers:</strong></p> <p><strong> Junction management</strong> </p> <p>Often used by ITV, which on Monday brought forward the ad break that was due to follow Who Wants to be a Millionaire? into the programme itself, meaning the show over-ran by four minutes. </p> <p>Result: viewers were transported straight into the Frank Skinner Show without a break, and those who turned to BBC news had missed the 10pm headlines. </p> <p>For its part, the BBC started One Foot in the Grave at 8.58pm, hooking in viewers before they had a chance to switch over. </p> <p><strong> End credit promotions</strong> </p> <p>In its simplest form, a continuity announcer whets viewers' appetite with \"next on BBC1...\" as the credits roll. And for two years, Chris Tarrant has closed Millionaire with a mention for the subsequent ITV show. </p> <p>But the marketeers are getting more sophisticated: both BBC and ITV have begun to incorporate fully -produced promotional films into the end credits of big shows such as EastEnders and Coronation Street. </p> <p><strong> Stunt scheduling</strong> </p> <p>Millionaire is described by BBC executives as an \"exocet missile\" - it destroys everything in sight. </p> <p>But the BBC has begun to hit back: in a fortnight, it will screen two half-hour editions of EastEnders on Tuesday, \"hammocked\" around a special peaktime edition of the hit Anne Robinson daytime game show, The Weakest Link. On Thursday, it screens an hour-long EastEnders special to mark the departure of Frank Butcher from Albert Square. The new series of Casualty opened with a two-part special last weekend, over Saturday and Sunday.</p>",

  "<p>Genetically engineered bugs and plants with an appetite for toxic waste are part of today's arsenal for purging the planet of man-made pollution - a process called bioremediation. </p> <p>Barren wastelands, once home to industrial processing plants, are a blot on the landscape. However, these \"brownfield\" sites could be cleaned in a cost-effective, environmentally-friendly way for commercial re-development. </p> <p>Left to its own devices, nature eventually disposes of organic matter, but it takes time. </p> <p>Bioremediation takes advantage of the natural ability of living things to remove hazards that threaten human and animal health. Genes are borrowed and engineered into plants or microbes to make them super-efficient at degrading pollution, \"fast-forwarding\" a natural evolutionary process that would normally take years. Once a pollutant appears, the local microbial community tries to tackle this potential source of energy. </p> <p>To find contamination-consumers, scientists collect soil from polluted plots, isolate bacteria which have have adapted to the environment and feed them with contaminants common to the site. </p> <p>\"Selective enrichments\" ensure that only those able to metabolise pollution are isolated. Genes encoding the relevant metabolic enzymes can be cloned and engineered into more suitable bacteria for optimal digestion. For a career in waste-digestion, a microbe must rapidly and completely digest organic waste without producing offensive odours or noxious gas, reproduce in hostile conditions and be non-pathogenic. </p> <p>Chlorinated solvents are troublesome contaminants and a headache for environmental protection agencies. These dense chemicals sink through the soil into groundwater supplies, spreading plumes of pollution over wide areas. </p> <p>Trichloroethane (TCE) and perchloroethane (PCE), which has four chlorine groups attached to it, are notorious environmental offenders. These highly toxic and potentially carcinogenic compounds are used in many industrial processes, including dry cleaning, and are widespread in the environment. </p> <p>Researchers at Cornell University discovered an anaerobic bacterium, known as Strain 195, that neutralises nasty chlorinated compounds into a harmless molecule called ethene. Hydrogen gas, produced by fermented organic matter, provides the electrons needed to break the carbon-chlorine bonds. </p> <p>Sadly, Strain 195 does not thrive in soil but cloning de-chlorinating genes facilitates their transfer to bacteria better accustomed to toxic territories. </p> <p>Chlorinated pesticides, like DDT, also lurk in the environment. Their by-products were previously thought indestructible but scientists at AstraZeneca in Canada have discovered a recipe of unusual ingredients for removing these persistent pollutants: old newspaper, straw and wood chips, chicken and cow manure and local soil bacteria that gorge themselves on organic waste, digesting it into carbon dioxide and water. </p> <p> C ontaminated soil is mixed with large amounts of the waste making an enormous compost heap which is tilled and aerated every few weeks. The microscopic chemists convert pesticides and their by-products into less toxic end-products using bacterial enzymes called dehalogenases that chop off the chlorine groups. </p> <p>Soil levels of DDT fell by 95% during a year-long test at an old pesticide factory in Tampa, Florida. </p> <p>The rise of nuclear power has generated thousands of radioactive waste sites. Soil and groundwater are contaminated with toxic solvents, radionuclides such as caesium, plutonium, strontium and uranium, and heavy metals including chromium, lead and mercury. Cleansing these sites in the US by conventional methods is dangerous, labour-intensive and estimated to cost $250bn over 70 years. </p> <p>Although bacteria can deal with diverse pollutants, radiation damages their DNA. But Deinococcus radiodurans, first found in meat tins during radiation sterilisation experiments in the 1950s, can withstanding radiation thousands of times stronger than the lethal dose for humans. To diversify Deinococcus's diet, scientists have engineered it with genes borrowed from Pseudomonas putida, a bacterium which uses organic solvents as a carbon source. With an improved genetic vocabulary, Deinococcus degrades toluene under radiation levels characteristic of contaminated sites. This radiation-resistant bug could be engineered to guzzle other organic pollutants or immobilise heavy metals. </p> <p>Plants with a penchant for radioactive metals have been found around Chernobyl. These \"hyperaccumulators\" store metals in more harmless complexes in vacuoles - special subcellular compartments. Uranium-absorbing sunflowers are being field-tested at a Department of Energy facility in Ohio. </p> <p>Solvent spills could also been tackled by plants. Tests in Oregon showed that poplars could remove 97% of TCE applied during watering, either storing it in a safer form or metabolising it. Plants can be engineered with bacterial genes for converting chemicals into safer compounds, providing a renewable, solar-driven means of cleaning contaminated sites. The environment agency estimates there are around 150,000 brownfield sites in the UK comprising over 300,000 hectares of affected land. </p> <p>Recent government targets demand that 60% of all new houses should be built on these sites, leaving \"greenfield sites\" free from urban sprawl. Bioremediation is an evironmentally-attractive and economical alternative to energy-intensive incineration methods or chemical-based soil washing processes which destroy soil structure and concomitantly release other chemicals into the environment. It is a sustainable, and more permanent path towards a cleaner, greener environment. </p> <p>\u0095 Dr Claire Cockcroft is a molecular biologist at the Institute of Biochemistry, Cambridge.</p>",
  "<p>Rupert Murdoch, chairman of the News Corporation, has blamed arch-rival Vivendi for delaying the proposed stock market listing of the media group's satellite assets. </p> <p>In a meeting with investors in Adelaide, Mr Murdoch said that the uncertainty over Vivendi's 22.7% stake in BSkyB, the UK satellite operation, had put back the proposed listing of Sky Global Networks by weeks. </p> <p>Shares in News Corp, which is based in Australia, fell almost 8% to A$19.95 yesterday amid increased fears that the group would not be able to accomplish its proposed listing because of the turbulent market conditions. </p> <p>Mr Murdoch also fielded questions about the allocation to him of 24m options in the company's shares, worth some $35m. </p> <p>Shareholders pointed out that, as the owner of some 30% of the group's voting shares, the Murdoch family needed little encouragement to invest further. </p> <p>Stock options are typically awarded to retain key executives and analysts pointed out that no other media company is likely to try to poach Mr Murdoch or his sons. Lachlan Murdoch, his eldest son, also received stock options worth $9m as a result of the new in centive plan. A company spokesman said that the family had not before received share options. </p> <p>News Corp also pointed to some uncertainty in its earnings outlook for 2000-01, with its United States television stations at risk in a weakening market after a strong start to the year. Rupert Murdoch also declined to make any firm predictions about the group's volatile film business after blaming \"a couple of stinking films\" for much of last year's net profit fall to $794m from $917m. </p> <p>The often tempestuous relationship between Mr Murdoch and Jean-Marie Messier, the head of Vivendi Universal, appears to have reached a new low this week following Mr Messier's decision to jettison his stake in BSkyB to win regulatory approval for his merger with Seagram of Canada. </p> <p>According to Australian news reports, Mr Murdoch said this decision had \"been a factor in slowing\" the proposed flotation. </p> <p>He added that \"my friend Mr Messier\" was likely to swap the UK holding for one in Sky Global. </p> <p>However, in New York this week Mr Messier said that any holding in Sky Global would be an \"interim solution\". </p> <p>After suggesting last week that he was open to the possibility of holding shares in Sky, Mr Messier said: \"At the end of the day, part of the undertaking was to exit any direct or indirect relationship with Sky.\" </p> <p>The EU had given him \"total flexibility\" to sell the BSkyB stake within two years. </p> <p>When asked about his relationship with Mr Murdoch, Mr Messier said his rival understood that he had a \"duty to maximise the value\" of his stake in BSkyB. Vivendi would not benefit from a \"disorganised\" sale that would depress the price of Sky Global. </p> <p>In an interview with French newspaper Le Figaro this week, Mr Messier described Mr Murdoch as \"a partner who is not easy\". </p> <p>Mr Murdoch tried to ease concerns that he would scrap the flotation. He said that, although the initial public offering was at least a month away, News Corporation was busy drawing up documents for the deal. </p> <p>Mr Murdoch is keen to sign up a US satellite business such as Hughes, the satellite broadcaster owned by General Motors, or Echostar as a partner in the new company.</p>",
  "Gerald Corbett's job as chief executive of Railtrack - regularly referred to as the most hated corporation in Britain - was never going to be easy. But even the self-assured and confident Mr Corbett, a financial specialist whose career has spanned top jobs in several big companies, could not have imagined the scale of the problems he would face. <p>Aside from needing to turn a company still imbued with the culture of a rundown nationalised industry into an efficient enterprise delivering top-class customer service and impressive shareholder returns, there were countless other issues to deal with. </p> <p>There were major incidents such as Tuesday's crash and last year's Paddington disaster, the daily delays and discomfort suffered by commuters, the political pressure piled on by a government determined to improve the rail system, the demands of the new rail regulator and the problems caused by rain, snow, sunshine and wet leaves. </p> <p>He once described his \u00a3400,000-a-year job as \"like sitting in a river with a flood coming towards you\". </p> <p><b> Thinking</b><br> </p> <p>A graduate of the \"firm but fair\" school of management, Mr Corbett is described by colleagues as \"an honourable man\" who \"kicked a lot of ass and got people really thinking about safety and investment\". </p> <p>He was undoubtedly deeply affected by the death of passengers in the recent crashes. This month he passed up an opportunity to defend Railtrack's reputation on a Radio 5 Live phone-in, deciding instead to spend the time with the families of Paddington victims on the anniversary of that crash. </p> <p>In yesterday's resignation statement he said: \"The families of the bereaved are foremost in my mind.\" </p> <p>Mr Corbett admitted that Railtrack was Britain's most hated company and cited as evidence the bricks thrown through signal boxes and the spitting and swearing at staff wearing the company's orange jackets. Such incidents shook him to the core, and he took them personally. </p> <p>But public relations were not always his strong point. In the aftermath of Paddington he pulled out of an interrogation on BBC2's Newsnight after an aide reportedly claimed he was tired, and he walked out on another interview when a reporter asked him if he thought he was likely to face corporate manslaughter charges. </p> <p>A keen skier, tennis and bridge player, the Oxford and Harvard educated Mr Corbett describes his style as combative and direct. In his three years at Railtrack he has earned a reputation for telling it like it is and taking the blame wherever he believes it is due. </p> <p>Last July, apologising for long delays - stretching all the way to Glasgow - caused by work on the approach to Euston station in London, he said: \"I'm afraid it has been truly dreadful, and it has been largely down to us and our contractors. We are trying to do a hell of a lot of work, and the way we have been doing it has not been good enough. I am very sorry about that.\" </p> <p>Railtrack insiders said he was convinced that the government wanted his resignation after the Paddington crash last October, which claimed 31 lives after a Thames Trains driver passed a signal at red. </p> <p><b> 'Buck stops here'</b><br> </p> <p>Tony Blair and John Prescott, transport secretary, were reported to have wanted him to quit, believing that the buck stopped at the door to the chief executive's suite. He refused, but admitted shortly afterwards that he would have tendered his resignation if Railtrack's signalling equipment had been faulty. \"If that light had been at green I would have gone. But it was red. There is an important principle at stake here.\" Only later did it emerge that drivers had made a series of complaints about the faulty signal. </p> <p>Mr Corbett can be seen as the victim of his own decision, post-Paddington, to assume leadership for the entire industry and become its voice - a modern Sir Peter Parker, renowned British Rail chairman, in a privatised, fragmented business environment - and the fear is that Mr Prescott will now seek more scapegoats, with more heads to roll. </p> <p>Mr Corbett, 49, took the job at Railtrack after a career in more conventional companies, where the top executives are never likely to become publicly reviled figures. </p> <p>Married with four children, he started out with seven years as a management consultant. He then spent five years with the electrical retailer Dixons before becoming finance director of the building materials group Redland. </p> <p>In 1993 he was appointed finance director of the Grand Metropolitan pubs and leisure group, only to lose his job when the company merged with Guinness to form Diageo. </p> <p>He walked away with a \u00a3600,000 pay-off and within months had landed the top job at Railtrack. He was a rail user, as well as the boss, taking a train daily from his St Albans home to Railtrack's head office at Euston station. </p> <p>Mr Corbett was seen by Railtrack insiders as the leader who told demoralised, traumatised staff that they should not be ashamed but should rise to the challenge of making the railways safer and better. He brought in a new safety director and set up area safety groups. </p> <p>He was also the first to raise the issue of franchises for train operators, saying that they were too short to make investments count, and to demand government funding because of the economic benefits an improved railway system would bring. Both points have since been taken on board, with longer franchises now being awarded and Mr Prescott's 10-year transport plan. </p> <p>Mr Corbett's business associates describe him as a superb boardroom operator. One said: \"He's incredibly stimulating, extremely bright, a very good lateral thinker who expresses himself very well.\" </p> <p>Dubbed \"the fat cat controller\", he was on a one-year contract and last year received a pay package of \u00a3398,000, including \u00a321,000 in perks. However, he turned down a \u00a3100,000 performance bonus, as he believed it was inappropriate to accept the payment after the Paddington disaster. </p> <p>If Mr Corbett does indeed go, it will be viewed as a disaster among train operators. \"He bullied and pushed for more investment, encouraged everybody to start thinking in a different way and made as many enemies as friends,\" a senior source said. \"With a strong chairman and board he would have been less in the firing line - they have a lot to answer for.\" </p> <p>As for his replacement, one rail insider said: \"Ministers won't accept an insider so it will have to be an outsider, maybe from abroad.\"</p>",

  "In the final, hyped, stereotyped TV clash between the fibber and the fumbler, between dullard and dunce, between the man who cooks the books and the man who makes syllabub of syllables, Al Gore emerged as America's safe choice. The Democrats' presidential candidate again demonstrated his mastery of the issues, if not the means of addressing them. Mr Gore's new watchword is \"prosperity\". In emphasising a record of continuous economic growth, falling unemployment, falling crime and rising incomes, he asked why Americans should gamble on change at the top. After eight years as vice-president, he argued, he represents continuity while his inexperienced rival, George W Bush, represents risk. The Republican would squander the nation's fortunes on tax cuts for millionaires, wreck social security, neglect education, drill for oil in your back yard, and transform US global leadership into one big exit strategy. If it ain't broke, don't fix it, says Mr Gore, the panjandrum of policy, the feisty facts and figures guy, the Mr Competent who knows how government works - and will make it work for you! <p>Mr Gore's problem, and maybe the reason why he trails marginally in the polls, is that safe is not sexy. Mr Bush came across in the debate as likeable, more relaxed and humorous. Unabashed at his lack of Washington savvy, he portrayed his know-nothingness as a virtue (a long American political tradition). He was an outsider, he said - a stunning claim given his presidential lineage. He would end paralysing partisan bickering. He would shrink federal government, trust the individual and yup, fry killers. Mr Gore was just a Dukakis-school liberal spendthrift (the ultimate insult). \"If this were a spending contest, I'd come in second,\" Mr Bush said with his trademark lop-sided smile. Here were conscious attempts to echo the ever-popular Ronald Reagan, who navigated by first principles, ignored the details, worked the 9 to 5 day Mr Bush prefers, and cracked jokes. </p> <p>As Senator Lloyd Bentsen might have said, Dubya is no Ronald Reagan. But he does have the common touch Mr Gore lacks. If this election were about urgent crises, big problems, complex choices, the Democrat would walk it. But it is not. Right now, middle America is on Easy Street. It can afford to indulge itself, take a bit of a chance. Mr Gore has less than three weeks to stop that happening. For all his worthiness, he could yet be a victim of the very prosperity he now exalts.</p>",
  "The time has come, surely, for Railtrack to be taken back into public ownership (Disaster strikes at 115mph, October 18). Not only is subsidy being siphoned from taxpayers' pockets to Railtrack shareholders and directors but, worse, no one ever seems to take responsibility for the deaths of increasing numbers of passengers.

The UK has the most disorganised rail network in Europe, with woefully under-resourced infrastructure and rolling stock and a safety regime that borders on the criminally negligent. </p> <p>Why? Principally because for most of the 18 Tory years the industry was progressively run down and starved of long-term investment within a climate of overt ideological hatred of state-owned railways. Ironically, and perhaps a tribute to the then breed of railway professionals, efficiency for a while actually increased in terms of unit operating costs and levels of external financing required. </p> <p>Alas it has proved to be a mirage, since all that was happening was that the assets were being sweated to an unacceptable degree. The recent disasters were waiting to happen. It will continue to get worse for as long as rolling stock and locomotives, plus train crews, are hammered day in and day out. A \"just-in-time\" business operating policy is dangerous in a mass-transit environment and it is time Railtrack and the politicians responsible got their safety priorities right. </p> <p>Of course the cost will be enormous and will be resisted (despite bold talk of a 10-year plan, which will never see the light of day) by the Treasury, as it has done for 50 years.

He sees the 250,000 English-speaking expats in Holland as a heterogenous community. \"Some get their flights, accommodation etc found and paid for - they are really looked after by their companies. But many others, probably the majority, are not helped much at all and face the realities of Dutch life - finding a flat (which in Amsterdam, for example, can be difficult and expensive), registering with the authori ties, making friends, finding a school for their children.\" </p> <p>Payn also sees the internet as an emotional resource. \"Arriving in a new country can be a daunting and lonely experience. A website can provide a central point of reference for expats. As well as reading the site, our visitors can interact with other expats in our discussion forums, email the editor with questions and comments, place classified ads. A lot of our ideas for content come from our readers.\" </p> <p>Expatica, which has received seed funding from the Dutch government, recently launched in Belgium. </p> <p>Not all sites are local. <a href=\"http://www.expatexpert.com\">Expat Expert</a>, one of several global sites teeming with links, highlights the hassles experienced by spouses and families. Robin Pascoe, a Canadian author who edits the site, explains: \"Many of the visitors to my site are unwilling expats. I write in the context that expat life is indeed a privilege and a wonderful opportunity. But having said that, I try to reassure women especially that they are still allowed some time for transition and have permission not to be happy 100% of the time!\" </p> <p>Certainly there can be a downside to being an ex-pat wife - particularly if you are caught in the middle of a riot while taking your daughter to a Girl Scout's show in Indonesia. You can read an account of such an experience at <a href=\"http://www.expat-moms.com\">www.expat-moms.com</a> a site especially for women who, as their motto says, \"give their children the world\". </p> <p>The site offers advice on other important topics for mothers such as raising bilingual children and making a relocation checklist. </p> <p>On the business side, tno single global supersite has emerged to date, though the expat-friendly European Internet Network has spread quickly across Russia, China, the Balkans and Eastern Europe (see <a href=\"http://www.russiatoday.com\">www.russiatoday.com</a>). </p> <p>As markets go, expatriates are often a small but wealthy segment of any major city; globally, they are a very attractive proposition. On the e-commerce front, expatriate Brits for instance - who typically miss their M&amp;S underwear, curry paste and TV comedy shows - are potentially a soft target for exporting. </p> <p>So will future expats travel thousands of miles to stay in and check out the footie on the web at home? Will there be a global community of armchair expatriates, bonded together by nostalgia and friendlessness and the subconscious need to go home or, indeed, elsewhere? </p> <p>Not likely. The spirit of most sites is basically \"click on to get a life\" and expats are often travel mad. </p> <p>Virtual reality might have its advantages, but in the hazy, never quite real world of expatria, it is as liable to still itchy feet as driving to work in the rain back home. </p> <p>\u0095 Chris Moss is editor of <a href=\"http://www.expatvillage.com\">www.expatvillage.com</a>, a site for expatriates in Buenos Aires, Argentina</p>",
  "<p><strong> You're the boss so you must have lots of nice Compaq kit at home. </strong> I have quite an impressive desktop PC with a flat screen monitor, and a notebook PC, and I have a similar desktop in the office. I also have one of those hard-to-get handheld colour iPaqs, and I do use it an awful lot. I carry it around and sync to Outlook twice a day. I quickly write emails to individuals and thoughts to my assistant, and the minute I synchronise, whoosh, they're off: it's quite powerful. </p> <p>In the next few months it will have a mobile sleeve added and I'll download real-time. There's a whole new community developing on the web around PocketPC devices with people downloading MP3s, books and videos and so on. </p> <p><strong> How much email do you get? </strong> Typically,I get around 300 emails a day, but about half of those are copied to me rather than written to me. I spend half my time answering email. There's a great opportunity for anyone who can do something to simplify it with voice recognition and artificial intelligence. </p> <p><strong> What are your favourite websites?</strong> I'm a big car fanatic so I like looking at sites about classic cars, and I frequently look at the <a href=\"http://www.whatcar.co.uk\">What Car?</a> website. I catch up on the latest news about Formula One - we sponsor the <a href=\"http://www.bmw.williamsf1.com\">BMW Williams F1 team</a> and <a href=\"http://www.williamsf1.co.uk\">www.williamsf1.co.uk</a>. </p> <p>It's a bit Compaq-centric, but because we have the Compaq NonStop boat in the <a href=\"http://www.btchallenge.com\">BT Global Challenge</a>, I like to log on and see how that is going. </p> <p> I have to look at different newspapers, and I also like to tap into papers in San Diego, where I grew up, to keep in touch with the community and see what's going on. Then I have a favourite football team - not a gridiron team, I've been converted. I support <a href=\"http://www.chelseafc.co.uk/chelsea/frontpage2.shtml\"> Chelsea</a>. That will probably alienate half your readers! </p> <p><strong> What brought you to Europe? </strong> I came to the UK nine years ago on a 30-day assignment, and got the opportunity to head up a big project at IBM. Then I met my wife here, and the rest is history. </p> <p><strong> Compaq UK used to be one man in a rented office, back in 1984. How big is it now? </strong> Compaq UK is around 10% of Compaq's business worldwide so it's around $4 billion. We have about 5,000 people working in sales and service in the UK, and a similar number in manufacturing up in Scotland, where we manufacture everything for Europe, the Middle East and Africa. We're one of the biggest exporters in Scotland. </p> <p><strong> How important is the internet?</strong> To me, it is as profound a development as the advent of electricity in the 1900s. I think we are in the early stages of realising the full potential of the net. The convergence with wireless devices is just one step on the road to transforming the way we live our lives both at home and in the workplace </p>"
