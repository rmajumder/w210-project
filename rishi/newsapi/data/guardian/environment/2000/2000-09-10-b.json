  "<p>Anyone who has watched BBC2's recent series Brain Story could be forgiven for being slightly in awe of Professor Susan Greenfield, as she delves into our most incredible and unfathomable organ. Greenfield is, after all, professor of pharmacology at Oxford University, a key figure in the international field of neuroscience, author, broadcaster and the first woman in the past two centuries to be director of the Royal Institution. </p> <p>And who works for a boss like this? Answer: the charming and self-effacing Viv Pearson, 51, who has spent the past 18 months as Greenfield's PA. \"You need a lot of stamina to keep up with her,\" she says. \"She is very fair but she works at 110% all the time and hasn't got a free evening until December.\" </p> <p>Hardly surprising, as Greenfield effectively has two day jobs - the professorial role in Oxford and the Royal Institution directorship in London. \"Most of my work is managing her diary and correspondence, booking flights, making sure she has transport and checking that the people she is going to see will look after her properly,\" confirms Pearson. </p> <p>She claims to have no scientific background whatsoever, and says the most daunting aspect of her job is dictation. \"When I first arrived, some of the words Susan was using, like acetylcholinesterace - which I now know is an enzyme - I couldn't even get my tongue round. But she is very patient.\" </p> <p>As for her working environment, any of us conjuring up visions of Hammer Horror flicks, with devilish white-coated technicians sawing up brain tissue, will be disappointed. \"This is a totally brain-free zone. The work on the tissue is done in the labs, and if they are working on something unsavoury, I don't go in,\" Pearson insists. </p> <p>The work carried out in the pharmacology department focuses on a particular group of brain conditions - Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and motor neurone disease - all of which are treated by different drugs. \"However, my department is exploring the idea that there is something common to all three conditions. The idea is that they are all triggered by progressive damage to groups of neurons,\" says Pearson, who recalls the time when she came into slightly more contact with the human brain than she would have wished for. </p> <p>\"When the BBC was working on the brain programme, I had to go to collect a brain in formaldehyde. As I was carrying it down the corridor, it leaked all over my dress and drenched my feet. I thought... hmm, interesting.\" </p> <p>Although Pearson is not directly involved in the media spin-off from Greenfield's TV work, she does find herself on the frontline with the general public. \"Since the programme went out, there have been at least two or three calls a day from people who have had something wrong with their brains, or in some cases are terminally ill. They offer to come up to the labs and be used as guinea pigs, or they think Susan is a medic and can cure them. I have to be really sensitive and listen. You can't turn round and say, 'I am sorry, I have to stop you there.' Sometimes I feel really useless. It would be lovely to make them better.\" </p> <p>Although new to the world of neuroscience, Pearson has a solid work track-record, albeit on a part-time basis for many years, while she brought up her two children. And since she is married to a professor she is no stranger to the workings of the academic mind. </p> <p>During her professional life she has worked as a PA in Cyprus, emigrated to South Africa, worked as a secretary to a finance company, and done time as a long-haul air stewardess. Before her present post she was a part-time PA in a firm of surveyors in Oxford. </p> <p>\"By the time I was 48, I felt I was ready for the challenge of a fulltime job,\" she says. But was the world ready for her? \"There is a barrier to older people. Some people think that 50 is really old. I had a couple of interviews and you could see the shutters coming down.\" </p> <p>Pearson first came across her boss-to-be in a national newspaper. \"I read her column and found it fascinating stuff. When I found out that she was looking for someone I knew I wanted the job.\" She describes Greenfield as the sort of woman who doesn't put labels on people, a personality trait that worked in her favour. \"I turned up for the interview at the age of 50, with no science background, but I was keen, enthusiastic and wanted the job.\" </p> <p>And she has every intention of staying. \"I learn something every day. It is all fascinating. When you say science to people, they usually think - ugh! But everyone has a brain. That's why it is such an appealing subject.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Brain Story, by Susan Greenfield, is published by BBC Worldwide at \u00a317.99</p>",
  "<p>Bored with lining your boss's pockets? Want to work for a company you feel is doing some good in the world? Join the club. According to the Institute of Business Ethics (IBE), support staff are joining the rapidly swelling ranks of UK workers who are turning their backs on employers with no sense of moral responsibility. </p> <p>\"With last week's news that the government is to drop its ethical foreign policy, there are likely to be even more of them taking it into their own hands to ensure that employers lacking values are employers lacking loyal staff,\" says Simon Webley, IBE research director. But if the foreign office finds it too difficult to stick to its commitments, how easy is it for the support worker to find a truly ethical employer? </p> <p>The voluntary sector is perhaps the most obvious port of call - and one of the most popular. Voluntary Services Overseas (VSO) has just announced a record number of applications, an indication that workers are looking for a job that does more than just pay the bills. \"The most common reasons given were the wish to give something back and a need for personal fulfilment,\" explains Matthew Bell, VSO's director of communications. But bills do need to be paid, and the financial rewards in the voluntary sector will barely cover your weekly groceries, let alone your rent or mortgage. The VSO's national recruitment campaign, launched earlier this year, was upfront about job prospects: \"Lawyers wanted. Salary \u00a3400 per annum. And yes, you did read that correctly.\" </p> <p>Even paid posts within charities - and indeed the public sector - can offer far lower salaries than average. That's why, says Webley, it's good news that more and more private businesses are introducing a \"code of business ethics\" - something that shows staff and prospective staff just how seriously they are taking their moral responsibilities. </p> <p>A typical code will address corporate policy towards its various stakeholders: employees, shareholders, customers, suppliers and the wider public. Standards relating to suppliers, for example, are likely to include a commitment to ensuring that there is no child labour at any stage of its supply chain, and that wages and working hours are reasonable. Meanwhile, standards relating to staff might include policies on what to do if you are offered products - such as stationery - that you suspect have been made by exploiting workers in developing countries. </p> <p>As part of their code, some companies, such as C&amp;A, have set up a trust to send inspectors on regular visits to check the ethical standards and practices of all suppliers - whether in east London or the Far East. Other employers, including Marks &amp; Spencer, and Monsoon, have joined the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI), \"a membership body that focuses purely on setting standards for labour within supply chains,\" explains David Steele, its information officer. </p> <p>Nevertheless, research shows that a few employers do write a code of ethics simply to look good. Upon closer inspection, there may be little real commitment. </p> <p>\"That's why it's so important for values-driven secretaries to ask at the interview stage not only whether there is a code, but whether you can see it,\" advises Rachel Ormond, an academic researcher in ethics and employment. \"It will always exist in document form, and increasingly it is included on the company website and in the annual report. </p> <p>\"You might also want to ask whether your prospective employer encourages staff to get involved in giving something back to society,\" she adds. Employees may do voluntary work, for example, either wholly or partly in company time, and usually on projects initiated by the company. Allied Dunbar sends staff on one-month secondments to help with projects in India. And at M&amp;S, 100-hour part-time secondments are set up for staff to help with local community projects, which are carried out over three-month periods. </p> <p>So important are employers' ethics becoming to today's jobseeker that research shows that they are often the deciding factor when a candidate opts for a particular post. \"In reality, pay and training tend to be a higher priority for support staff,\" says a spokesperson for recruitment consultancy Manpower. \"But because it's a jobseekers' market at the moment, they can often take those two for granted.\" </p> <p>The ETI's David Steele claims that media coverage has encouraged workers to take a broader interest in the companies for which they work. \"There has been a recent influx of documentaries and features highlighting conditions in factories overseas, as well as on issues like child labour in this country,\" he says. \"The fact that the internet has created a global economy is also significant. We no longer think of a sweatshop in Korea as being so far away.\" </p> <p>A spokesperson for recruitment agency Adecco adds a further reason: job-seekers have a greater choice in selecting companies they respect and share common values with. \"More employers are 'going ethical' every day. The result is that if you're a secretary who wants to work in, say, the City, you can now pick a company that you know invests in environmental projects.\" </p> <p> Robert Weston, founder of Groundswell, an ethical business consultancy, explains, \"Organisations approach us not only asking, 'How do we become more values driven?' but 'How can we be seen to be values-driven?' The second question comes from employers' knowledge that to sell their product and to attract the best recruits, they have got to have clear-cut values.\" </p> <p>Shell is one company that has had to work particularly hard at reassessing its approach following past controversies concerning the disposal of the Brent Spar oil platform and the company's activities in Nigeria. Last year, the company unveiled a new ethical advertising campaign - in part aimed at improving its image among prospective employees. \"We want to be seen as a company willing to confront these often difficult issues, not sweep them under the carpet,\" a company spokeswoman explains. </p> <p>Sue Jenkins, PR manager at Triodos - a Bristol-based bank which invests exclusively in organisations with social and environmental objectives - believes that after the greed-oriented 80s, there has been an inevitable move towards \"giving\". \"Most of our candidates now apply because of our values,\" she says. </p> <p>Jane de Bude, PA to the managing director at Triodos, is one such person. She left her last position as a legal secretary for a large solicitors' firm after she became disheartened by their lack of ethics. \"I work hard here,\" she admits. \"But I believe wholeheartedly in what I do. I feel I'm putting something back into society rather than just concentrating on how much money I - or my employers - make. It has made a huge difference to my level of job satisfaction.\" </p> <p>In the end, predicts Alex MacGillivray, deputy director of the New Economics Foundation, ethical issues will become so crucial in the recruitment process that instead of a bunch of well-known \"good\" companies, there will be a blacklist of notoriously \"bad\" ones. Few will want to be listed among the latter. Already, according to the IBE, 83 of the FTSE 100 companies have a code of business ethics. </p> <p>\u0095 Further information: <br>The Institute of Business Ethics: <a href=\"http://www.ibe.org.uk\">www.ibe.org.uk</a> 020-7798 6040;<br> Ethical Trading Initiative: <a href=\"http://www.ethicaltrade.org\">www.ethicaltrade.org</a> 020-7796 0515; <br>Voluntary Services Overseas: <a href=\"http://www.vso.org.uk\">www.vso.org.uk</a> 020-8780 7200; <br>Triodos: <a href=\"http://www.triodos.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">www.triodos.co.uk</a> 0500 008270</p>",
  "Women who suffer sexual harassment at work might be disheartened by the acquittal this week of Surrey's deputy chief constable, Ian Beckett, on charges of groping female employees. They should not be deterred, however, from complaining themselves. <p>As with all criminal cases, the Beckett jury would have been required to find that the events claimed to have happened took place 'beyond reasonable doubt'. They were not satisfied of this. But industrial tribunals and employers need only find harassment 'on the balance of probabilities', a much lower standard of proof. </p> <p>Women victims of workplace harassment should also not be deterred from complaining by an apparently low level of success. Cases now tend only to reach the public domain if they are particularly prurient. Hundreds are settled every year, as employers become sensitive to bad publicity. </p> <p>Too often, some men still fail to appreciate that attention they might find flattering from colleagues - casual touching or very personal inquiries - is regarded as intrusive by women. The best employers already recognise this. </p> <p>Some of the worst, epitomised by the armed services and the police, have failed to address the problem adequately. It is no coincidence that they also have recruitment crises. On this occasion, trades unions teach useful lessons. A large part of their recently-f ted boost in membership has come from women. </p> <p>The Transport and General Workers Union, once a bastion of Old Labour misogyny, has seen a 30 per cent rise in the number of female members in the last decade, a period during which it started addressing the workplace needs of women. </p> <p>Everyone has a right to work in an environment which is not threatening or humiliating, but it isn't a matter of political correctness. If employers want to retain the most able staff, it's good business. </p>",
  "<p>Safety experts have expressed alarm at significant changes to nuclear waste handling procedures being introduced by British Nuclear Fuels. The revisions include plans for a series of unmanned radioactive waste dumps up and down the country for debris from its ageing power stations. </p> <p>It has also emerged that the company is scaling back plans to build protective shells around nuclear reactor buildings - which are to be left for periods of up to 135 years after closure - and that reactors and waste stores are to be unmanned and monitored from a central point. </p> <p>MPs, environmental campaigners and senior industry safety experts say the plans would expose communities to danger and threaten the environment. </p> <p>The dumps will be established on the sites of BNFL's 11 Magnox power stations - built from the Fifties onwards around the coast of Britain - which are scheduled to close over the next 20 years. They will take 'intermediate level' radioactive waste (ILW) - the second most perilous category, which includes items such as contaminated fuel casings, sludges, resins and discarded reactor equipment. </p> <p>They are expected to remain in place for at least 40 to 50 years and potentially a lot longer, since there are no plans for a permanent store for the nation's nuclear waste. A Green Paper on what to do next, originally planned for the summer, is now expected to be published at the end of October. </p> <p>According to BNFL, the waste will be put in concrete and placed in purpose-built or modified buildings. A spokesman said: 'A separate company whose raison d'etre is long-term storage is better placed to deal with it, but this is not our main business.' </p> <p>Nuclear safety expert John Large told The Observer: 'What is happening is extremely worrying. It is one thing having a working nuclear power station, but it is quite another to store waste for long periods on sites not originally designed for it.' </p> <p>Large also said he had serious concerns about proposals to scale back on protective cladding for reactors, which BNFL plans to leave for around 100 years after they are shut down. The industry regulator, as The Observer reported last month, has argued that this should be bought forward to 40 years. </p> <p>BNFL has also said it no longer plans to use high durability cladding materials, but would use standard materials to reinforce existing buildings and re-clad where necessary. Large said that would weaken the protection of the reactor cores. </p> <p>David Chaytor, MP for Bury North, said: 'No-staffing at these sites is unacceptable.' </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:oliver.morgan@observer.co.uk\">oliver.morgan@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "It had become a persistent theme of media commentary that, in New Labour plc, Blair was the chairman and Brown the chief executive. The Prime Minister giddied around the globe from summit to summit; the Chancellor was the colossus who bestrode the peaks at home. The implication was that while the Prime Minister was the grinning, travelling salesman of the Government, the man of substance and action was the Chancellor. <p>Blair was initially sanguine about all this. To one aide who worried that the Chancellor was becoming over-mighty, Blair expressed himself unbothered: 'When I sit in the garden of Chequers, and the sun is on my face, I know who is the Prime Minister.' Others around nagged him about the markedly more comradely noises in Brown's speeches which seemed designed to pitch himself to Labour MPs as a more radical substitute for Blair. The Prime Minister again appeared unfazed. 'If Gordon uses a bit of left-wing rhetoric, so what? It keeps the party happy.' </p> <p>A civil servant remarked to Blair that when Margaret Thatcher and Nigel Lawson were together it was like 'watching two strangers talking'. Blair replied that his relationship with his Chancellor was like 'a marriage'. </p> <p>Lurking in the recesses of any argument between Prime Minister and Chancellor was Brown's belief that he had been the making of Blair. The Prime Minister couldn't entirely subscribe to that, but he did acknowledge his debts to Brown. 'It's always there when Gordon is arguing with Tony - \"you owe me\" - even if it's not very often expressed,' says a Cabinet Minister. </p> <p>Officials marvelled as they were also shocked at the open disdain with which Brown would sometimes treat Blair. Aides and colleagues remarked upon the extraordinary efforts Blair devoted to managing Brown. 'He mediates, he negotiates, he defuses, he cajoles, he rails, he shouts, he hugs, he flatters,' said a close observer of the relationship. </p> <p>The 'normality' of Blair was an act, but it was more than a performance. It was his self-conceit that 'I do not think of myself as a politician'. Of course, he was a politician, a most extraordinary politician. What he meant was that he had not been born and bred by the machine; his every breath was not politics. The same was not true of Brown, a man consumed by the political since an early age. 'Gordon's problem is that he hasn't got a family,' Blair told one confidant, which he also believed to be the central explanation for what was wrong with Peter Mandelson. </p> <p>Blair thought that he had a unique capacity for dealing with his turbulent and talented friends. Ministers, aides and civil servants who brought him complaints about the Chancellor's uncollegiate behaviour were told by Blair: 'I can handle Gordon,' in the manner of a psychotherapist talking about a brilliant but temperamental child. </p> <p>Gordon went through 'unco-operative' stretches, the Prime Minister explained to one close friend, but 'he always comes back in the end'. A senior civil servant who has observed them at close quarters confirms: 'It is like a marriage, a tempestuous marriage. The rows can be terrible. But if you're on the outside and you interfere, you won't be thanked for it afterwards. You come between them at your peril. When it comes to make-up time, everyone else is to blame, rather than they themselves. </p> <p>By the New Year of 1998, the marriage was increasingly strained by stretches of crockery-throwing. Blair's ambition to turn No 10 into the corporate headquarters of his government had been frustrated. While his energies were dissipated, the design to turn the Cabinet Office into a Department of the Prime Minister, imposing his writ across Whitehall, was not realised. Brown saw the vacuum and rushed to impose himself in it. The Chancellor's comprehensive spending review was an opportunity to delve deep into every department which he further exploited by binding Ministers to his will through 'public service agreements' with the Treasury. The good reason for this - ensuring that money was efficiently spent - was allied to a manipulative motive. It was an attempt to make the rest of the Cabinet agree to serve the Treasury. </p> <p>Regular, and from a variety of Ministers, were the protests to Blair that Brown's idea of consultation was to pick up the phone and bark his decisions at them. David Blunkett complained that Brown would block his ideas and then repackage them as the Chancellor's own under the New Deal label. 'Blunkett would go bananas,' says a civil servant. So provoked was Blunkett by Brown on one occasion that the Education Secretary stormed from his ministerial suite shouting 'the mendacious sod', demanded his car, and told the driver to take him straight round to Blair. His alarmed officials rang No 10 to warn them of the imminent arrival of an incendiary Secretary of State. </p> <p>Blair began to tire of dousing colleagues inflamed by Brown. Expressions of his exasperation with the Chancellor became more frequent. 'Jesus,' Blair despaired to officials and aides. 'What has Gordon done now?' </p> <p>At moments of extreme exasperation, Blair would cry: 'God! Gordon can be impossible.' The surface tension manifested itself in increasingly demented infighting between the rival entourages at Downing Street and the Treasury. Alastair Campbell made time in his frantic schedule to compile a bulging file of cuttings of newspaper stories inspired, or so he believed, by Charlie Whelan to promote the Chancellor at the expense of the rest of the Cabinet and the Prime Minister. </p> <p>The relationship was so fissiparous that something as apparently innocuous as a friendly biography of Brown provoked mounting agitation at No 10. In early January, Campbell demanded of Whelan that he let him have a pre-publication copy of Paul Routledge's life of Gordon Brown. Campbell called him a liar and smashed down the phone when Whelan replied that he couldn't, because he had lent the only copy in his possession to John Brown, the Chancellor's older brother. It was long beyond the point of mattering whether or not Whelan was telling the truth: he probably was in this case. The relationship between him and Campbell had collapsed. </p> <p>This grudge match between the spinners was amplification and aggravation of the stress lines between Prime Minister and Chancellor. It also served as a proxy for the battle for ascendancy between them. It suited both Blair and Brown to pretend to each other, even to themselves, that vicious briefing by their rival coteries was not of their making. Whelan's excesses occasionally made Brown wince; some of Campbell's activities caused Blair to flinch. Yet both gun dogs were broadly following their masters' wishes. Otherwise, they would have been muzzled or put down. On one of the many occasions when Mandelson demanded of the Prime Minister that he force the Chancellor to dispose of Whelan, Blair replied: 'How can I sack Charlie when he's only doing what Gordon's telling him to do?' </p> <p>The biography of Brown - written with 'his full co-operation' - was an admiring account of a man about whom there was much to admire. Routledge accurately depicted the Chancellor as a man scarred by the way in which he had been denied the crown by Blair. Picking the scab off this wound presented Brown, a picture that was not as kindly as the biographer intended, as a man eaten by past wrongs. Calculated to infuriate Blair was the book's tendentious suggestion that he was a cheat and a charlatan who broke a blood promise to his oldest political ally and robbed of his birthright the man who was supposed to be his closest friend. </p> <p>The nature of the Blair-Brown relationship was a subject I thought worth exploring in my column for The Observer. Of many conversations I had that week, the most significant was with a person I described at the time as 'someone who has an extremely good claim to know the mind of the Prime Minister'. I would describe them that way today. </p> <p>For the first five minutes of a long conversation with this person, I was spun the familiar line that no political coupling was more blissful than that between Blair and Brown. The Prime Minister esteemed the Chancellor as 'a great talent' and 'a great force'. But, after a little prodding, an entirely different account began to tumble out. Brown's self-promoting biography was 'a classic piece of misjudgment'. The Government could not afford 'any more lapses into this sort of nonsense'. </p> <p>Why, I wondered, did Brown behave like this? 'You know Gordon, he feels so vulnerable and so insecure. He has these psychological flaws.' Warming to the theme, the other person poured out a litany of complaint about how all the Government's afflictions had been caused by the Treasury. 'If you go through the real disasters of our time in government - EMU, the Geoffrey Robinson affair, ISAs, single parents - I'm afraid there is a common thread to them all. They are coming out of the Treasury.' This was not entirely just: chief responsibility for the Ecclestone Affair lay at the door of No 10. The complaint continued: 'What Gordon has done is cut out the civil service, and that just leads to trouble.' Blair was obliged to take control of the committee on welfare because other members of the Cabinet 'just don't trust Gordon. There's so much venom against him.' </p> <p>The highlights of the insight this offered into the nature of the relationship between Prime Minister and Chancellor formed the basis of the column I wrote that weekend. The vivid phrase 'psychological flaws' was projected on to the front page of The Observer. There was a media excitement. </p> <p>Peter Mandelson spoke truthfully when he denied authorship of 'psychological flaws'. Many, though, thought they heard the voice of Mandelson, who had been depicted as a treacherous Iago in the Brown biography, speaking later that Sunday. It was reported by a BBC political correspondent on Radio 4's main evening news that 'close allies of the Prime Minister are furious at the Chancellor for, as they see it, reopening old wounds'. The reporter continued that 'some have warned' that while the Chancellor is in a very strong position 'that may not last for ever, and nobody is indispensable'. The reporter was Lance Price, known to be close to Mandelson, who would succeed Tim Allan as a press spokesman at No 10. </p> <p>Monday's newspapers seized on this startling evidence that the friction between the Treasury and Downing Street was much more inflamed than had hitherto been appreciated. The Mirror had 'Britain's two most powerful men at war'. Labour MPs, the more innocent of whom had swallowed the line that it was always harmony and sweetness between the neighbours of Downing Street, reacted with shock. </p> <p>In an attempt to smother the flames, an over-protesting Alastair Campbell declared on the Prime Minister's behalf that he regarded Brown as 'an extremely excellent Chancellor'. Brown, who happened to be in Brussels, made a professional job of publicly shrugging it all off as 'essentially rumour, gossip and tittle-tattle'. He was masking a profound hurt. He smarted at the attack, partly perhaps because this complex man could recognise some of himself in the description of his vulnerabilities and insecurities even as he was understandably insulted that they were labelled 'psychological flaws'.</p> <p> On Brown's return to London, there was a clench-jawed confrontation with the Prime Minister. Brown dressed his anger in a concern for the standing of the Government. It was 'destabilising', Brown complained to Blair, as well as being 'unfair' to him personally. 'This damages me and you,' Brown thundered at Blair. 'Why are you letting this go unpunished?' Brown's desire for retribution was thwarted because Blair could not - or would not - tell him who was responsible. 'I can't believe it was anyone here,' responded Blair. Brown thought Blair was lying. </p> <p>Blair was apologetic that things had got so out of hand, but he had his own grievances. He told Brown he had brought this on himself with 'that bloody stupid book'. How long had he been warning him that Brown would be the one damaged by 'the Whelan operation'? Brown came to the opposite conclusion. This episode confirmed to him how important it was to retain the services of Whelan as the bodyguard of his reputation against No 10, and as the instrument of his retaliation. </p> <p>Brown possessed a valuable weapon - information - which he used to disadvantage Blair. The Chancellor was always confident of winning an argument about economics with the Prime Minister, much the less confident in the area of the pair, so long as Blair did not have independent sources of advice. Brown decreed to the Treasury that the Number 10 Policy Unit, including Blair's personal adviser on economics, was not to be supplied with information about the March 1998 Budget. Brown was again keen to sweep away tax breaks that he regarded as illogical and redundant such as mortgage tax relief. 'Is this wise, Gordon?' Blair would ask, a favoured formulation for framing his worries about something proposed by Brown. </p> <p>Among his own intimates, Brown took to saying: 'Tony is the master of wise politics' in a voice that hovered over being a compliment before descending into sarcasm. Brown had a premonition of what to expect in the summer reshuffle because he had been shut out of the debates within Downing Street. By four o'clock on the last Sunday in July, all of the Prime Minister's key aides were safely and secretly gathered inside No 10. There were no cameras to watch them arrive: Alastair Campbell had artfully misled the media that Tony Blair was spending the weekend at Chequers. Sally Morgan, the head of the Political Office, had a little list: Ministers who were camp followers of the Chancellor. They were marked for execution. 'How will he take it?' Blair worried out loud. No one expected the Chancellor to take it well; all agreed that it had to be done. According to one of the aides in the room that afternoon: 'It was Blair versus Brown. Blair had to win.' </p> <p>At any rate, he had to be seen to win. As the reshuffle was announced, it became evident that Blair was carpet-bombing the network of supporters Brown had placed in government. It was designed to establish who wore the trousers in Blair's 'marriage' to Brown. There was talk from No 10 of a more 'formal' style of decision-making. </p> <p>Chairing his first co-ordination meeting at No 10, the new Cabinet 'Enforcer', Jack Cunningham, looked around at Campbell and Whelan. He made a display of taking charge. He thumped the table: 'The feuding must stop!' The feuding would last much longer than Doctor Jack. </p> <p>\u00a9 2000 Andrew Rawnsley.

  "Many Olympians spend \u00a320,000 a year on drugs, untraceable substances which even new blood tests cannot detect.

  "<p>The claim that nobody makes serious money from the Internet is not strictly true. The exception is the legal profession, which is rapidly discovering that cyberspace is almost as profitable an arena as corporate mergers and acquisitions. </p> <p>The latest episode in this '$600-an-hour-plus-expenses' farce closed last week with a US Federal judge ordering <a href=\"http://www.mp3.com\">MP3.com</a> to pay crippling damages to Universal, a record company that is part of the Seagram group, for alleged infringement of copyright on compact discs manufactured by the company. </p> <p>Judge Jed S Rakoff (sic) ruled that MP3.com had to pay $25,000 for each of the Universal compact discs included in its My.MP3.com service, which lets users listen to a CD over the internet after indicating that they possess the disc in question or have purchased it through an online vendor associated with the company. </p> <p>Universal had demanded $45,000 a disc but, even so, its lawyers emerged beaming and went off to order another five Lexus 400s apiece. </p> <p>There were similar scenes a few weeks ago when a troop of attorneys won an interim victory over Napster, a company that allows Internet users to share MP3 files over the net.

Will the EU challenge the US patent laws that allow the patenting of 'business processes' such as Amazon's 1-Click ordering system? Will the Norwegian government see the absurdity of arresting a teenager on the grounds that he has violated the (US) Digital Millennium Copyright Act? And so on ad infinitum. </p> <p>Most media coverage of the MP3 and Napster cases fails to make a distinction between the companies on the one hand, and the technologies they seek to exploit on the other. Both MP3 and Napster are traditional start-ups, funded by large amounts of venture capital subscribed by very classy firms. These backers are not charitable institutions: they clearly saw a way of making money from their prot\u00e9g\u00e9s. (In Napster's case, Hummer Winblad saw the economic potential of the 20 million users the company had acquired in less than a year .) If the interim judgments of the US courts stand, these venture capitalists will take a bath. Cue violins. </p> <p>But even if MP3.com and Napster are crippled or wiped out by litigation, the technologies on which they are based will continue to flourish. MP3 is now the global standard for compressing audio signals. It's free, public and universally available. </p> <p>Most 10-year-olds know how to 'rip' an audio CD into MP3 format. Similarly, the technology underlying Napster - software enabling peer-to-peer file-sharing - is out of the bottle, and new variants such as Gnutella, Freenet and AT&amp;T's Publius are up and running. (They are also technically impossible to police - though with Publius file sizes are limited to 100k, which makes it unusable for MP3 but perfectly good for text.) </p> <p>This is the reality that recording industry executives apparently cannot see. The logical conclusion of their current strategy is effectively to define every teenager on the planet as a criminal or a potential lawbreaker. </p> <p>Given that teenagers represent the prime market for recorded music, this looks like a lousy business strategy. But it looks just great to their lawyers. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:john.naughton@observer.co.uk\">john.naughton@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>The failure of <a href=\"http://www.pop.com/\">Pop.com</a>, the much-heralded site from Dreamworks and Ron Howard's Imagination Entertainment, may just be to Hollywood what <a href=\"http://www.boo.com/\">Boo.com</a> was to the fashion industry. </p> <p>After the 11-month old firm was gutted of employees last week, details began to emerge of mismanagement and overambitious designs to rival that of its fashion counterpart. Pop did not burn through quite as much money (most supplied by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen) as Boo, but it suffered the indignity of never actually launching at all. </p> <p>The idea behind the company - to broadcast a mix of animated and live-action short films on the internet - was greeted with much excitement last October, before the dot.com shake-out took hold. Founders Howard, Steven Spielberg and Jeffrey Katzenberg trumpeted their new venture as one of the firms that would revolutionise the way films were made and distributed. As soon as the technology allowed, they believed, Pop.com would transform from showcase for talented young film makers into fully fledged production and distribution company. </p> <p>Announcing the new company, Katzenberg said: 'Just as MTV introduced a new entertainment forum for music videos, we think this new enterprise will offer a new form of entertainment for the rapidly growing population of internet users. Pop.com has the capability not only to offer a variety of entertainment options, but to tap into an as yet undiscovered talent pool that is as global as the internet itself.' </p> <p>Pop was supposed to act as a platform for experienced movie makers to experiment with the emerging medium and, when it was launched last autumn, its founders spoke of using the web as a seed bed for new projects for film and television. However, despite agreements with Mike Myers, Will Smith, Julia Roberts, Eddie Murphy, Steve Martin and others to create programming, nothing ever appeared on Pop.com besides press releases. Instead, it became a place for DreamWorks to store its talent when the studio had nothing else for staff to work on. </p> <p>Then, on 1 August, the Los Angeles Times ran a story questioning the site's finances, the commitment of its backers and its prospects for success. Rumours circulated that Allen had grown tired of funding it: the daily frustrations stemmed 'from too many egos in the kitchen', according to one employee. </p> <p>Insiders pointed to Pop CEO Ken Wong's lack of experience either as a manager or in the internet world: 'We needed someone with film or dotcom experience, not someone with neither.' Before Pop, Wong was in semi-retirement, and before that he was president of Disney's Imagineering division. Moreover, observers said that of all online entertainment sites, Pop was the most bureaucratic and disorganised. </p> <p>'It was put together in the days when people thought if you put enough big names and big money together, things will work themselves out,' says Sanjay Malhorta of BandWidth Capital. 'As the market caught up with the expectations of business plans and good management, those weaknesses became glaringly evident.' </p> <p>None of Pop's high-profile principals were present at last week's meeting to all but shut the company. When asked why neither Katzenberg, Spielberg nor Howard had attended, Wong had no real answer: 'We believe this space is not yet a business. We're not clairvoyants or geniuses, but we think it's going to take years.' </p> <p>Pop's first major acquisition, last autumn, was an acclaimed short film called The Dancing Cow. It sat on the shelves waiting for the site's launch. Excerpts from DreamWorks' Chicken Run were also scheduled to be released but never materialised. 'It's sad that all these filmmakers got tied up for so long with nothing to show for it,' said Randy Greenberg, vice president of independent film company Always. </p> <p>But the closure of the firm is more than just the failure of yet another web company without a viable business model. It has shown how hard it is for even the biggest names in entertainment to make sense of the web at a time when the medium itself is rocking the industry's foundations. Not only is the music business fighting for what may turn out to be a Pyrrhic victory against copyright troublemakers such as Napster and Gnutella; there are also signs that mass piracy is about to afflict the movie industry as well. </p> <p>Since the demise of the Digital Entertainment Network last spring, problems with the internet have scared away investors. The decision to fold Pop was related to failed merger talks with iFilm, which were terminated 10 days ago. Sources say iFilm had balked at Pop's valuation, which is said to have been $200 million. </p> <p>Others have suffered, too. 'Digital entertainment universe' Scour.com has laid off 56 of 62 employees, saying it ran out of money. A dozen employees were laid off at Shockwave.com, the entertainment site from Flash technology maker Macromedia in San Francisco. That site carries between 700 and 1,000 pieces of content and relies on banner advertising for income. Shockwave is believed to have made expensive deals with the likes of South Park creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker and director David Lynch, but the shows have failed to materialise. The company's planned IPO for late this year now looks doubtful. </p> <p>Efforts by Microsoft and America Online, among others, to translate TV-style shows to the internet foundered a couple of years ago. Neither have multi-media websites devoted to women fared well. The much trumpeted Oxygen site has experienced an exodus of key editors and staff; and shares in iVillage have plummeted from $95.88 to around $7. Several executives have left during this year, and in late July Candace Carpenter stepped down as CEO. </p> <p>Despite all this gloom, webcasters are planning to roll out dozens of new online entertainment programs as the new television season starts this autumn. </p> <p>The subject matter, aimed largely at university students with access to high-speed campus internet connections, pushes the limits of taste. The offerings still have to overcome technical limitations and the fact that the audience for online entertainment is still tiny. Romp.com is launching a new game called 'Avoid Commitment', where players have to hurl a martini at a temptress and then seduce her; another, called 'Panty Raid,' involves retrieving underwear from a girl's dormitory. </p> <p>'This is like the 1940s in television,' David Wertheimer, chairman of WireBreak Networks, a firm that creates and syndicates web programmes for other sites, told the Wall Street Journal . 'There's no standard for what works and doesn't work.' </p> <p>And viewers are growing. Despite its problems, Shockwave.com drew 5.7 million users in July, up from 207,000 a year ago, while AtomFilms had 749,000, up from 247,000 a year ago. </p> <p>But the technical limitations of broadcasting over the web remain the biggest problem for most users. 'People don't think of the internet yet as entertaining them the way television or a movie does,' says Kristen Harmeling of Yankelovich Partners, a US marketing research firm. </p> <p>Whatever the future of internet broadcasting, Pop.com is unlikely to play a part. Howard said setting up Pop had been a 'tricky, sometimes frustrating' process and although the partners still had 'a lot of enthusiasm for the future of the medium' they wished to wait for the technology that would make entertainment on the web a more rewarding experience. Pop would wind up 'back where we started', he added.</p>",
  "The number of mothers in the British prison system has reached an all-time high, more than doubling in the past 10 years, an investigation by The Observer has revealed. <p>The record numbers reflect the growing prison population but also increasing willingness among judges to jail women who are pregnant or have young children. Of 3,524 women being held at the end of last month, two-thirds were mothers and more than 1,000 were pregnant or had children under the age of five. Current estimates suggest 5,500 children have mothers in prison. </p> <p>According to Frances Crook of the Howard League for Penal Reform, the true figure may be higher because a large number of women hide the fact they are parents from the authorities, fearing their children may be taken away while they serve sentences. </p> <p>At present there are just 72 places in four prison mother-and-baby units nationwide, and these are restricted to children under 18 months - deemed the age by which they are more aware of their surroundings and thus likely to be psychologically damaged by the prison environment. Two new units are being built and more should follow. </p> <p>The problem is particularly acute for mothers from the South and West - the nearest unit for mothers from Cornwall is in Cheshire. </p> <p>Lawyers have suggested that the current practice of splitting jailed mothers from their babies could be challenged from October when the Human Rights Act, which guarantees a right to family life, comes into force. </p> <p>Earlier this month Martin Narey, director-general of the Prison Service, stunned reformers by announcing that he was considering increasing the total amount of time children could spend with their mothers to four years. </p> <p>As the majority of mothers in jail are the primary carers of their children, they often emerge homeless, poor and unable to maintain family life. By contrast, male prisoners usually have a partner to keepthe home going. At any one time, some 95,000 children have fathers behind bars. </p> <p>Nick Flynn of the Prison Reform Trust warned: 'In trying to do the right thing, the prison service is in danger of making things worse. Prison is not a place for children.' </p> <p> <a href=\"mailto:tony.thompson@observer.co.uk\">tony.thompson@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "The people of Karakalpakstan have come to fear the dust storms that sweep across this region, whipping up grit from the sandy basin of the dried up Aral Sea and depositing it in a fine layer over their homes. For a few moments the day is darkened, the sky turns grey and suddenly the choking dust is everywhere - scratching at at eyes, grazing throats. <p>Over the past few years these heavy, gusting clouds of grime have become more frequent; scientists recently named the area the dustiest place on earth. But at the root of locals' fears is not the quantity of dust, but the highly poisonous toxins it contains and the sickness and disease it brings. </p> <p>Most people here believe that the dust is the main cause of the dire health problems: epidemic levels of tuberculosis, debilitating respiratory illnesses, widespread kidney problems, high infant mortality, rampant anaemia and painful intestinal ailments. </p> <p>It is more than 10 years since the world first began to learn about the crisis in the Aral Sea - described by the United Nations as 'the most staggering disaster of the twentieth century' - but scientists still have no more than a partial understanding of the damage inflicted on the five million people who live near the shrivelled shores of what was once the world's fourth largest lake. </p> <p>In 1959, keen to boost cotton production in the dry plains of central Asia, bureaucrats in Moscow conceived a brutally ambitious scheme to irrigate huge swathes of desert land and transform them into lush plantations. A network of unlined canals was built, water from the Aral Sea's two tributaries was diverted to the cotton fields and powerful pesticides were pumped liberally into the system. Twenty years later the region was producing nine million tonnes of cotton a year, but locals had noticed with alarm that the sea was shrinking. </p> <p>With only a trickle of water coming in, the sea retreated rapidly, and what remained of it became saltier and poisonous, killing most of its fish and much of the wildlife on its shores. As the sea shrank to half its former size, a sandy area about as big as the Netherlands was exposed, baking and cracking in the sun. </p> <p>'When I was a child I used to swim in the sea. Now it isn't there. It's like a fairytale in reverse,' said Almagun Matnazarova, a former schoolteacher from the onetime port town of Muynak, who scratches out a living selling socks and vests at a stall in the bazaar. At the town's outskirts, the deserted beaches where she used to play now edge on to the cracked scrubland that is the former seabed. Rusting trawlers are marooned in the sand. The coast is almost 100 miles away. </p> <p>After the collapse of the Soviet Union, international aid agencies hurried to the region - now divided between Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan - but almost all of them focused on the environmental fall-out from the catastrophe: the collapse of the eco-system, the damage to local flora and fauna, the effect on the region's environment. </p> <p>Just as they had been ignored by the Soviet planners of the 1950s, the people were largely forgotten about by environmental workers. It is only now, with concern mounting over the fate of those left stranded by the desiccated seabed, that serious research into the health impact of the worst man-made environmental disaster is beginning. </p> <p>Joost van der Meyer, a research director with M\u00e9decins Sans Fron ti\u00e8res, which is championing the need for a greater focus on the people of the region, said: 'The health and social consequences of the disaster remain a blank spot on everybody's map. It was seen primarily as an environmental issue so no one bothered looking at the people. The impact on the local population is still not well known.' </p> <p>His researchers have started to study the dust to establish whether it really is one of the causes of the widespread ill-health. Every year, the wind is estimated to whip up some 150,000 tonnes of particles which were shown to contain a variety of organophosphates and organo-chlorines, old-fashioned pesticides long-since discarded on safety grounds. These pesticides have been detected in the milk of breast-feeding women in the area and are believed to slow down children's mental development. </p> <p>Half of the children who die in the Karalpakstan area of Uzbekistan (the region which surrounds the former coastline) are killed by respiratory diseases - asthma, chronic bronchitis, pneumonia - an extraordinarily high ratio, probably increased by the irritating effect of the dust. </p> <p>Over the 30 years in her job, Ibadullayeva Sarakdin, head of the children's ward in Muynak hospital, has witnessed the children's increasing breathing problems. 'About 60 per cent of them suffer from some kind of bronchial problem. Often we don't have the medicine to treat them.' Most of the deaths are caused by late hospitalisation. Parents are often reluctant to bring their children in until they are critically ill. 'Although the treatment is free, they have to pay for the food here - many can't afford to,' she said wearily. </p> <p>Drinking water at least four times saltier than that in the West is also causing an array of complaints from kidney disease to heart problems. </p> <p>But the gravest threat to health is posed by the total collapse of the economy and the ensuing chronic poverty. Muynak once had a profitable fish canning industry as well as a thriving tourist business. Now it has bankrupt fish processing plants, bankrupt hotels and bankrupt building companies. Even the local cinema has closed. </p> <p>Unemployment is high and few can afford to feed themselves properly. The explosion of TB cases is caused by this poverty, as is the anaemia which affects more than 70 per cent of women, and around 99 per cent of pregnant women, draining their energy and precipitating complications at birth. </p> <p>A drought this summer has wiped out almost all of the region's crops and the UN last week warned that famine could follow. </p> <p>The future for the people of the Aral Sea looks bleak.</p>",
  "<p>At the Saatchi Gallery's Ant Noises 2 exhibition stands a curious series of glass cages. The innermost cage contains an easel, a smock and a roll of toilet paper and the outer box two tables, painter's palettes and brushes. This is Contemplating A Self Portrait (As A Pharmacist) by Damien Hirst, his take on the artist's studio. The only sign of recent life is the faint smell of white spirit emanating from the gaps between the glass plates of the cage. </p> <p>Hirst didn't want to talk about his piece; he is very busy in New York. But as an artist who has already exerted a huge influence on the art world, might this piece herald a new fashion for giving the public a glimpse into the inner sanctum? </p> <p>For many, the studio is a sensitive issue; Tracey Emin also didn't want to talk about hers let alone allow a stranger near such a 'private place'. Lucian Freud has painted his studio with its sagging sofa and pile of paint rags into his pictures for years. Picasso once referred to his workplace as the 'scaffold', hinting that each time he approached the canvas it was like meeting the hangman; that any public execution of him as an artist would begin at the canvas. Last year the sculptor Eduardo Paolozzi transported a replica of his entire studio to the Dean Gallery in Edinburgh. </p> <p>So is the studio the hub of all creation? Or is it as relevant as the printing press where a novel becomes a bound set of papers? </p> <p>Just off a busy main road in south London lies a near-condemned warehouse, home to the Chapman brothers, Jake and Dinos. On the second floor, above a busy furniture workshop, they rent two rooms. The roof leaks. The floor is covered in dust. There is a big gap in the larger of the two rooms where a wall should be, along with a table-tennis table and their latest work - destined for the Royal Academy's forthcoming Apocalypse exhibition - the sprawling vision of a gruesome battlefield that is Hell . The fumes from the resin glue and spray paint they use for their work are strong enough to make visitors squint. When they first moved in to the building, four years ago, Jake and Dinos could smell the fumes. Now they are immune. </p> <p>'It's a depressant,' says Dinos. I point to the half-finished sculpture of Siamese twin boys with penises for ears, and ask if the fumes have influenced their work. 'Oh no,' he grins 'those are our happy things.' </p> <p>This studio is a mess, one that suggests its two occupants don't pay much heed to the consequences of their work. </p> <p>'The mess is the consequence of us working,' says Dinos. 'We could fill this with rubbish in a week.' The pair talk incessantly as they work. 'When you work on your own, you work for an imagined audience,' says Jake, 'and they present the work and receive feedback. But, working together, we're constantly viewing each other's work and hence have constant feedback. In some sense that writes out the audience and makes us quite indifferent to them.' </p> <p>Jake finds the fascination that buyers and critics have with the Chapmans' studio now palls. He recalls how a group of buyers once came to their old premises in Brick Lane. They were delighted to find that the lights didn't work and that they had to trample down a steep drop to get to some of the pieces. </p> <p>'They loved it,' he says, disapprovingly. 'But it's like going to Tesco, buying some beans and wanting to go to the factory to see where they are made. Mess, in some naff analogy, equals toil, which buyers find attractive.' </p> <p>The McDonald's just down the road has, for them, been the biggest geographical influence on their work. This is the 'McOffice', where most of their business gets done; where a rich buyer once approached the counter, ordered a coffee and then asked where he should sit to be served; and where they find 'the shallow end of the gene pool' that inspires the physiology of much of their work. </p> <p>Jake insists that a 'geographical psychoanalysis' of their warehouse as an influence on them won't wash, and that their studio is just a place like any other, irrelevant to their work. </p> <p>'If I could buy a machine, press a button on it and have the work come out, that would suit me down to the ground,' says Dinos. Neither of them shows any emotion when they say that within months the whole block will be knocked down to make way for a massive Asda supermarket. They'll move on. 'We'll just have less space and higher bills,' grumbles Dinos. </p> <p>Insouciance is something of a calling card for Young British Artists, so I approached some of art's more senior figures. Patrick Caulfield, who lives in an exclusive square in north London, has a bare, white-walled studio on the second floor. He also has a few hang-ups about the room. </p> <p>The work in progress, which he says is about 'hotels', faces the wall. Unfinished works remain private. The sign on the shelf, reading 'Absolut Caulfield' referring to the vodka, is in keeping with the faint smell of whisky that warms the place. Among the limited clutter is a stereo, a set of country and western tapes, and a book of nineteenth-century battles. There is a Wild Bunch poster on the wall, in Spanish. In his time Caulfield has worked in basements, in Soho studios and with half of his painting stuck out into the hallway. 'It doesn't matter what circumstances you work in. It's your job so you have to do it,' he insists. But the space has its effect on the mind. 'If I haven't got an idea of what to paint, I can hardly bear to climb the stairs to the studio. It's terrifying, because you're in competition with the last works you've done. I go to a pub, sit there and think before I come back - then it's as though I made a journey to get here.' But for Caulfield the contents and dynamics of the studio seldom influence the process of making the final product. 'I work from memory; I observe things. When I paint, the image is already in my head.' </p> <p>A close friend of Caulfield, Peter Blake, works in a very different environment. Blake, whose varied canon is often rather unfairly dismissed with a nod to his Sergeant Pepper sleeve for the Beatles, works in a 3,500 sq ft studio in west London. </p> <p>Full of what he calls 'works in progress', the space comprises a series of rooms where he sculpts, paints, or does woodwork surrounded by a huge variety of objects, from antique midget cowboy boots to Elvis lamps. While Caulfield requires blank space, Blake surrounds himself with objects. Both say that the ideas evolve in their head regardless of materials in a studio, yet nonetheless have completely different workplaces. </p> <p>Sculptor Richard Wentworth offers a clear perspective on the relationship between the workplace and the work over the phone from a gallery in Munich. 'It's never to do with art,' he begins. 'Studios are incredibly articulate, but really no more so than a kitchen. It's rather like anything else people do in life: much is limited by what their economic parameters support, much is limited by what they can bear. But these spaces are born of the equation of somebody's life.' </p> <p>It is a pretty tall order to convincingly tie the equation Wentworth mentions to somebody's work. But a more straightforward connection between the place and the artist became apparent when I went to see Gavin Turk, whose contribution to Ant Noises 2 is Death of Che. Turk spends his day in a room about 20 feet above the bustle of one of London's busiest and most littered streets. The staircase is dark and decrepit; the room caked in dust. </p> <p>Turk is explaining how sculpture, for him, is more involved in the process of physical creation than what surrounds him, when our attention turns to his latest project. In the middle of the floor, lies a piece of bronze sheet metal, that Turk has covered in dust and beige paints, and contorted so that it now closely resembles, in both shape and texture, one of many items on the street below: a cardboard storage box.</p>",
  "The attention to aesthetic detail starts at the gates, where leaves of hammered silver weave in and out of the Victorian wrought-iron work. Inside the converted church, colour lifts the spirit and the sumptuous spangled light from the stained-glass windows calms the senses. Inside, there's a water feature to keep the chi flowing and a Tree of Life mural with enamel flowers along its stem to represent the chakras. These features, along with the curved walls and ceilings, have been installed under guidance from a feng shui master to promote good relationships, growth and health. <p>The traffic outside bustles noisily along Fulham Broadway. But inside, plumped into comfy sofas are small groups of women who chat or sit alone, reading leisurely. All is serene and reassuring. It is like a gentlewoman's club for the New Age. But this is the Haven Trust; a drop-in daycare centre which offers complementary therapies to women (and their partners and families) who have breast cancer. Reiki, singing and yoga classes are all on the agenda, along with emotional advice and counselling. </p> <p>The Haven Trust was the brainchild of Sara Davenport, 37. Five years ago, her friend, Wendy Ricketts, was informed that she had breast cancer, and sent home alone to an empty house. Davenport was shocked to find out that she had been offered no emotional support at the time of diagnosis or during her treatment. 'It shouldn't be that way,' says Davenport. 'No woman should have to face cancer alone.' With that in mind, she sold her art-dealing business and ploughed a large sum of her own money into buying a deconsecrated church and then began building a team to raise funds for its conversion. Restoration of the former Welsh Presbyterian church and drama college cost \u00a3650,000. </p> <p>Wendy's breast-cancer treatment was a success, but she would definitely have benefited from the emotional support and therapies that the Haven is now offering, importantly, without the need for a referral from your doctor or specialist. In the main therapy rooms, various classes take place, such as yoga, art therapy and hands-on healing. Apart from being able to just drop in at the centre, it was also vital to Davenport that the Haven's services would be entirely free. The centre boasts five full-time healthcare professionals and 15 part-time and voluntary therapists, plus a seven-member fund-raising and administrative team. </p> <p>Since opening in February this year, the Haven has registered 2,000 visits. It is a drop-in centre that defies the term's common meaning in its attention to aesthetic beauty and the ethos that the environment is integral to one's health. And looks do matter. Davenport explains: 'I've always believed the environment is key to our wellbeing and strength of spirit. You walk into some NHS hospitals and think, \"I may never survive this place because of all the horrible grey walls.\" So we always wanted to create a beautiful space.' </p> <p>That the centre exists reflects a general attitudinal shift to a more positive and proactive approach to our health, a willingness to take more responsibility for our own personal wellbeing. Similarly, Theresa Hale, founder of the Hale Clinic, London's foremost private centre for complementary medicine, has also noticed a shift in the medical profession's attitude to complementary therapies. 'I think doctors have realised that they don't necessarily have all the answers. Scientific research is still key, but it must also be acknowledged that there are many issues around the effect of emotions on the body. If a person says a complementary therapy helped them, a doctor may say it's just a placebo. But so what? If a placebo can medically simulate the body's natural healing process, isn't that good?' </p> <p>Caroline Stevensen, director of services at the Haven Trust, says that nurses and therapists work in harmony with patients' specialists, and the centre may go some way to filling a gap left by an overstretched NHS. 'We are offering whatever support people might need - physical, mental or spiritual - outside the hospital environment. One of the best effects of these therapies is how they can help with some of the side-effects of conventional cancer treatment.</p> <p>For example, the tiredness, hot flushes, nausea and depression.' Stevensen says that those affected by breast cancer have to deal with special emotional issues. 'If you have a mastectomy or breast reconstruction, for example, it is slightly different to having a cancer where you've got a scar, but for all intents and purposes, it doesn't show. With breast cancer, there are a lot of issues around body image and femininity, mutilation, aspects of how they feel as a woman, as well as how their partners cope with it.' One of the psychotherapists, an ex-Relate counsellor, is on hand to talk to couples about these issues, as well as the children of those affected. </p> <p>Pam Morrow, 56, is single and lives in Chiswick. She is a freelance consultant in corporate communications, and was lying in bed one weekend when she discovered a lump in her breast. 'It was hard and small, like a pea. I hadn't been great at examining my breasts but when I found the lump, I acted quickly and went straight to my GP.' She was diagnosed with breast cancer at the end of April 1999. Doctors at Charing Cross Hospital found the lump malignant but containable. She had a lumpectomy and as a precaution had the lymph nodes removed, followed by six weeks of radiotherapy.</p> <p>'During radiotherapy, the side-effects build up,' says Morrow. 'The skin becomes very tender and you're warned to be careful of the whole area, and to avoid blistering. Mostly I felt extremely tired. I wasn't prepared for that level of tiredness.' She also developed oedoema (swelling) of the breast, a condition that affects 60 per cent of women with breast cancer. 'My breasts swelled up and my bra size went from a D-cup to an F. My consultant said the swelling would go but couldn't say when. The skin was so stretched it looked like a balloon about to burst. And it was uncomfortable and painful.' </p> <p>Although Morrow was treated at Charing Cross Hospital, which has one of the foremost complementary cancer units, she ended her treatment unaware of the Haven Trust but came across an article about its facilities and felt new hope. 'When I eventually called I heard a welcoming voice. The woman said they were sure they could help me, and when could I come in. She rang back in 20 minutes with an appointment time. I thought, \"Fantastic. Someone out there is listening.\"' </p> <p>Morrow was seen by nurse Trudi Coyne. 'She was very understanding. We talked through my medical history, including my sleep patterns and energy levels, and she suggested therapies that might suit and that I should see the lymphoedema nurse.' To combat the debilitating lethargy, the nurse suggested she should try Reiki, a type of hands-on healing. 'At the first session,' Morrow recalls, 'the therapist put her hands on my head. I sensed an energy running down my arms that flowed back again. I went in feeling like a limp lettuce and I came out feeling... well, I bounced out.' </p> <p>Morrow feels she's been helped to take a more pro-active approach to her health care generally. She was assessed by a nutritionist at the Haven. 'My diet has improved a lot.' She also had three weeks of lymphatic drainage, a gentle massage to help reduce the breast swelling. 'I've also learned how to do the drainage for myself each day, so I can just go in once a fortnight for maintenance. I've always been interested in complementary care, but the Haven has opened my eyes to the value of a holistic approach to health.' They also offered Morrow valuable emotional support.</p> <p>'My friends have been fantastic, and some have tried desperately to understand what it must be like to have cancer. But with the best intentions, they haven't experienced it. People don't talk about breast cancer, not in real life. Even if you meet someone who's had it, they don't want to tell you what's really involved. So after my first visit to the Haven, I walked down the street crying tears of gratitude. I felt an enormous burden had been lifted, as if someone else was shouldering some of the responsibility for my health.' </p> <p>Recently, there has been a mini 'breast-cancer backlash' against the upcoming October Awareness Month and the charities, which are considered by some to be feted for their fashionability. Michael Baum, professor of surgery at University College and Middlesex hospitals, even called for a 'breast-cancer unawareness month' to 'desensitise the public to panic and hysteria'. Caroline Stevensen simply refers to the bare statistics: 'Breast cancer is the most common cause of death in women aged 35 to 54. There are about 30,000 new cases each year in the UK. And the oft-quoted statistic about one in 12 women being affected by the disease at some stage in their life has just gone up to one in 11.' </p> <p>In September, the Haven Trust will have an open day for GPs, surgeons and breast-care workers 'so that we are actively connecting'. Then there will be counselling groups for men whose partner or loved one has breast cancer. There are also plans for a cr\u00e8che, a shop selling books, relaxation tapes, wigs, swimsuits, and Look Good, Feel Better sessions offering hair, beauty and fashion advice. The Trust already has the active support of celebrities such as Trevor McDonald, Anthea Turner and Bryan Adams, who last May auctioned his photographs, including those of Kate Moss, Liz Hurley and the Duchess of Kent, raising \u00a3140,000.

  "<p>Kerri Sharp has had quite a lot of jobs. She was once a goatherd in Crete: 'I lived in a cave and drank a bottle of brandy a day.' She was once a topless ice-cream seller in St Tropez. There was a brief period as a bus conductor in Torquay and a sojourn in a squat in Stoke Newington screen-printing Anarchy T-shirts for Malcolm McLaren. She was always 'feckin' skint'. </p> <p>Her family were full-on Gypsy Rose Lee travellers with no birth certificates or anything. They finally landed in Leytonstone, east London, though Kerri got out of there fast. 'My father was a singer - grew up with Krays, told stories about spivs, organised crime, Soho, the Messina brothers, prostitution, racketeering... I take after my dad...' Her mother, possibly afraid of this, sent her only daughter to a Catholic convent in Wanstead. 'I loathed that miserable God with his white beard and wagging finger.' </p> <p>It was not the right place for an eight-year-old who stuck nude pin-ups of Marilyn Monroe on the door of her locker and devoted her time to the Rudy Trudies, a club whose sole mission was to go out and find naughty pictures. 'My mother thought I wouldn't get a good education in the local state schools. What I got was an early introduction to sadomasochism.' </p> <p>Caned for spelling mistakes, caned for putting stickers on her briefcase, caned for not wearing a hat in the summer, Ms Sharp emerged with 'unparalleled loathing for authority and a desire to investigate everything that was seen as a sin'. </p> <p>This is a good thing, in general, and particularly useful to her current incarnation, for nowadays, Ms Sharp reigns over Black Lace books, Britain's leading seller of erotic fiction written by women for women. As an imprint of Virgin publishing, Black Lace writhes shamelessly on the huge bed that is Richard Branson's empire. Not all of his 200 enterprises make money, but Black Lace continues to be a success story. Three million books sold to date, in fact. Three million books that describe a vast range of proclivities. Vampires. Nordic gods. Gang bangs. Ice hockey. You name it. </p> <p>Ladies who lust are a faithful market. And a big one. While men will always reach for the top shelf and go for the gyno, women want words, and particularly words that are formed into phrases such as 'rock-hard' and 'Sit on my desk, Sister Clarissa'. Where once the female reader liked to read about kindly Mills &amp; Boon medics living in market towns, now they are absorbed by dark alleys and drag queens. Engagement rings and coy kisses have been replaced by whipping and ramming. </p> <p>'There's nothing wrong with romance,' says Sharp. 'But today's Black Lace books should be primarily concerned with hot, kinky sex, and not be ashamed to explore the filthiest behaviour. Being brave is what it's all about.' </p> <p>Sharp's own sexuality is coloured by adventure, and her love life has been enhanced by exotic scenery. 'I tried to be a lesbian for a year,' she says. 'But you weren't allowed to wear wigs.' Then there was a Rastafarian 'who taught me how to cook' and a man she met down the pub who had long blond hair, looked like a surfer, and spoke like a south London mechanic. 'My god, he was so pretty. He was going like, \"Have you got stockings and suspenders and lovely bras?\" I was like, \"I don't mind dressing up and stuff...\" but he said, \"No, they're for me!\"' </p> <p>Now aged 40, happily single, though in a committed relationship, Sharp has no intention of getting married or having children. 'I'm not a thirtysomething, got a mortgage and a lovely little place in Battersea...' she says. 'You know: waiting for a wonderful man, can't wait to have babies and go on posh holidays to Tuscany, no, no, no...' </p> <p>The libido is a strange thing - don't even pretend you understand it - but as a creative force, it has long been imbued with clear cultural significance, related as it is to everything from legal censorship to progressive thought. </p> <p>The basic symbology of erotica has not changed since John Cleland described the 'delirous transports' [sic] of Fanny Hill in 1748. As the 1959 study 'Pornography and the Law' recorded some basic themes - seduction, defloration, permissive authority figure, rampant hussy and the 'brute' as a sexual symbol - so all these things can still be found in Black Lace narratives. The song remains the same. 'Saving Julie', Catharine McCabe's short story, opens with: 'Reverend Billy Washburn sat at his desk, one hand gently rubbing the erection growing down his long, muscular thigh' - which directly echoes a line in the 1877 classic The Autobiography of a Flea: 'Father Ambrose was the living personification of lust.' </p> <p>Erotic fiction is still rude, but its history has changed. Once the sole domain of male writers, it is now subsumed by the female imagination, and that imagination is purveying that most manly of concepts - sex without emotion. The Black Lace heroine has sex for the sake of it. Sex without commitment. Sex without babies. Sex on Hampstead Heath. She does not get involved. Hell, she hardly hangs around long enough to lace up her thigh-high leather boots. </p> <p>'Black Lace came along at exactly the right time,' says Sharp. 'It succeeded where women's porn magazines failed.' </p> <p>Black Lace was launched in 1993 after a Virgin marketing questionnaire revealed that women wanted kinky erotica that it was possible to buy without embarrassment. An advertisement in The Guardian for 'an unshockable female' produced Ms Sharp. </p> <p>At that point she was working for the glossy fetish magazine Skin Two, having graduated with a BA in film from the University of Westminster. Her heroes were Vivian Stanshall (the comic genius behind the Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band) and Luis Bu\u00f1uel, but her belief system had crystallised the evening that she walked into a cinema in 1986 and saw Blue Velvet. </p> <p>'That film inspired me to study surreal directors, and I realised that the perverse subconscious was a valid form of emotional and artistic expression - to me, that is fantastically liberating, because it means living in a state of honesty rather than in a state of chintzy denial.' </p> <p>She settled into the Virgin office, then in Ladbroke Grove, and oversaw the first four books, one of which, Cassandra's Conflict, ignited a furore that ensured the success of the Black Lace series. The tale featured a sadomasochistic relationship, a dark master, a new nanny and an atmosphere of non-consensuality at a time when it was not clearly understood that the rape fantasy was about being overcome by a man of the mind's choice, rather than an actual desire to be maimed by some thug out of a drain in Hackney. </p> <p>'There was a lot of humiliation and violation in it,' says Sharp. 'And everyone went mad, saying, \"How dare you imply that women want to be hurt during sex\" and so on. The Daily Mail accused me of \"corrupting the morals of the nation's women and betraying civilised values\". The result was that they all sold out within a week.' </p> <p>Now, seven years later, Black Lace is respectable. Virgin publish two new novels and one reprint per month, each of which can expect to sell around 10,000 copies in England and America. There are popular collections of short stories and 'specials' are tacked as free gifts on to enlightened magazines, such as New Woman. The readers are from 18 to 40 years old and many of them, for some reason, are nurses. Sharp receives five unsolicited manuscripts a week and at least 10 short stories. She inclines towards writers that show some knowledge of the 'lineage of pulp fiction and cult films', and in general, she likes surprises. </p> <p>'I look for something that isn't an autobiographical piece about splitting up with your boyfriend and getting revenge by discovering your new sexuality,' she says. 'That's dull, and it is 80 per cent of what I get.' </p> <p>The authors range from Janine Ashbless, who composes erotic fairy tales in the tradition of Angela Carter, to 74-year-old Tesni Morgan, who manages to juggle her career with the demands made by nine grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. </p> <p>'I think erotic stories are enjoyed by career women who are too tired to have any emotional involvement,' Morgan theorises. 'They are often bringing up children on their own. They flop down, exhausted, after a day's work. All they want to do is relax with a glass of wine, and they would prefer to read a sexy book than deal with the stress that goes with a relationship.' </p> <p>Asked to name the writers who best epitomise the mood of the current sexual zeitgeist, Sharp cites Tabitha Flyte and Stella Black. Black has created an eponymous bisexual heroine with a degree from Oxford who wears black stilettos because she likes film noir. She lives in Hollywood, drives a mid-60s Firebird and packs a gun. She indulges in a wide range of postlapsarian pervery, her problems only arriving when she makes the mistake of falling in love. In this, she represents the basic schism that exists in erotic fiction for women: while relational values have always tended to thread through female erotica (and were the very thing that turned The Story of O into a work of quality), so they also impair emotional independence - and emotional independence is useful (if not indispensable) to the woman who wishes to be empowered by transgression. </p> <p>Erotic fiction is about having sex in complicated times. Sexism and body fascism still swamp popular culture and no one bothers to fight it any more. Commerce has won. Professional women undermined by the nesting instinct are in a double bind where the rules of the battle are that there are no rules and no obvious trophy. </p> <p>The result is a psychosexual schizophrenia that is encapsulated in Tabitha Flyte's short story 'The Chef's Revenge', where lewd Tasha 'rapes' a celebrity chef and he repays the compliment by later 'raping' her. It is a classic fable of modernity: lad girl/predator likes it when the man she has undermined turns on her because, in sexual terms, lad girl/predator likes a worthy competitor. </p> <p>'Many women fantasise about being dominated,' says the author, 'but I would only write such a thing in an appropriate context. I think it's really important to write in a way that does not demean women.' </p> <p>Flyte, 29, was born in Southend-on-Sea and read politics at Warwick University. Having worked in Asia for five years, she now lives in Tooting with her boyfriend. 'Most of my friends have read and enjoyed my work,' she says. 'I love telling strangers what I do just to see their faces!' </p> <p>She points out that the men who appear in her books tend to be the kind of men that she likes - that is, they are easy going, open minded and humorous. 'I'm not bothered by what men look like or how much they earn, so my characters tend not to have flash clothes or cars.' </p> <p>Asked if she thinks that erotic fiction is important, she says, 'It is when it shows women's sexuality in a positive light. Rather than portraying women as recipients or passive vessels, good erotic fiction explores their fantasies and show, them to be acceptable. How could this be a bad thing?' </p> <p> Last year, Sharp edited Wicked Words, a collection of erotic short stories that became the first British book to introduce slash lit to mainstream publishing. Slash lit was born at Star Trek conventions and then spread on the net in the Dark Ages when the web was first colonised by Trekkies and pornographers. Female dissidents met in a variety of virtual forums and posted short stories which appropriated mainstream sci-fi characters (in particular Captain Kirk and Spock) and placed them in a homoerotic context. Now a global phenomenon with an infrastructure of hundreds of sites and zines, slash sexualises everyone from Starsky and Hutch to Buffy and Xena. It is a world where a Dalek can date Captain Mainwaring and anything goes. </p> <p>The characteristics of slash fall in line with those demanded by any effective subversive activity. It is a means of expression for the individual (particularly those who feel marginalised); it is a way of undermining the hegemony of corporate concept; it is a completely new and innovative form of literature within the structure of an omnipotent technology; it operates, by and large, outside the demands of profit, which gives it freedom; it is egalitarian - anyone can post their work. </p> <p>Slash lit is the insubordinate's latest chapter to a history that not only relates an intimate relationship between erotica and subversion, but has also proved its political efficacy. The basic nature of slash fiction is illegal (no corporate publisher is going to print rude stories about another corporation's properties) and it is thus confined, but its links to erotic fiction are strong and represented by writers such as Kitty Fisher. Her short story 'Shadowlight' was modified for Black Lace, but reflects the traits of slash in that it is a sci-fi narrative about an affair between two men. </p> <p>Fisher, university educated, 40 years old and living in London, is bisexual and works in management. She has been involved with the slash-lit subculture for eight years and enjoys its renegade aspects. 'It is certainly part of the appeal for me. Going to a slash convention is still a bit like being part of a secret society - all these women from vastly different backgrounds sitting down to discuss whether Mulder would have better sex with Skinner or Krycek.' </p> <p>One of the characteristics of slash, which has yet to be adequately explained, is the fact that it is same-sex fiction (men with men, women with women) written by women for women. The anomalies of this are not simple: it is not just about lesbianism - heterosexual women are also involved. Why, then, are they both inspired and aroused by homo-erotica? This, of course, intrigues culture-studies types, who write long essays about complex pathologies, the creative implications of sexual guilt and the lack of female characters in popular culture. </p> <p>'I don't think any of the theories are quite right,' says Fisher. 'But I do think that women are only beginning to explore their sexuality.' </p> <p>Sharp has long been unafraid to engage herself as a pro-porn voice in the long-running debate that still severs feminist thinkers. 'It's time for women to make a friend of the word pornography,' she says. 'It doesn't have to be a pejorative term.' </p> <p>A couple of years ago she appeared on a David Frost programme and took on Catharine MacKinnon, the influential legal theorist who sees pornography as an engine of inequality that violates human rights. MacKinnon believes that the adult-entertainment industry should be made legally responsible for the damage it is causing. Sharp commented that by repudiating a woman's right to enjoy pornography, MacKinnon was denying the woman's right to have a sexuality, a point for which she received a round of applause from the audience. </p> <p>Sharp's politics were moulded in the mid-80s when, as a reaction against the 'awfulness' of Thatcherism, she became interested in the Socialist Workers' Party. 'I wouldn't dare admit to myself that the whole scene was dreary - those caucus meetings where you'd have Paul Foot and Tony Cliff and the guy who started Rock Against Racism, Paul somebody, who was a dish. But at the end of the day, you would have some terrible gentle beard in corduroys pressing your flesh and talking about Gramsci for 10 minutes. The imagination was not tolerated, there was no room for discussion, and there was no place for an alternative sexuality. It was the same with the unreconstructed feminism that was happening at the same time. It wasn't any fun.' </p> <p>Kerri Sharp's presence at Black Lace means that the imprint is more than a pulp factory churning out saucy books. She understands the subtle ebb and flow of sexual more and tends to steer her authors towards them; where once the narratives were full of pirates and Victorians, now they reflect the post-feminist paradoxes that exist within experimental sex, gender play, office politics and club culture. </p> <p>'The characters are getting older,' Tesni Morgan observes. 'Kerri thinks older women are more interesting...' </p> <p>As female writers continue to explore female sexuality, Black Lace works from within the system to disseminate messages about the joy of unashamed individualism. Ignored by reviews (a promotional tool that pulp fiction has never needed), the writers work in a world of their own. Creating their own cult heroines and spreading lubricious ideas about realistic possibilities, they are a fifth column percolating alternatives in an environment where the overall sexual perspective is still supervised by low-brow yobs.</p>",

'This is a revolution in the UK fund management industry,' it says. </p> <p><strong> How it works </strong> Henderson is converting its range of unit trusts into sub funds of an open-ended investment company (oeic). The sub funds operate in a similar way to a unit trust - shares are created by the fund manager when someone invests money, and dissolved when money is taken out, and their price goes up and down with the value of the assets held by the fund. However, an oeic sub fund can offer several classes of share with different charges. Henderson's sub funds have two classes: A shares, with an initial and annual management charge, and the new X shares, with no initial charge, but a higher annual management charge and exit charges in the first six years.X shares, now available for UK and European funds, will be available for global funds from 2 October. Existing investors in Henderson unit trusts will automatically have their holdings transferred into A shares. </p> <p><strong> Minimum </strong> \u00a31,000 outside an Isa, \u00a32,000 inside an Isa. </p> <p><strong> Charges </strong> No initial charge, annual management charges 1.25 per cent to 2 per cent depending on fund and exit charges of 4 per cent in the first two years, 3 per cent in the third, 2 per cent in the fourth and 1 per cent in the fifth and sixth. </p> <p><strong> Tax </strong> Free of income and capital gains tax if held in an Isa. </p> <p><strong> Risk </strong> Depends on the fund chosen. </p> <p><strong> Should you invest? </strong> Jason Hollands of London IFA Best Investment says although Henderson calculates that X shares work out cheaper during the first 10 years, this assumes you would pay the full 5 per cent initial charge on its A shares. He says you can avoid this by buying through a discount broker such as Best. X shares could prove more expensive over tim because of the high annual charge. Justin Modray of Chase de Vere Investments says: 'People planning to invest for more than nine years should go for something else.' </p> <p><strong> Points out of 10 </strong> Hollands - 6, Modray - 8.</p>",

He has a part-time job with BT and a full-time one at the BBC which involves shift work in the evenings and at weekends. </p> <p>The shifts enable him see more of his nine-month-old son Gabriel than if he worked from 9am to 5pm, but he wants fewer hours. </p> <p>However, he also wants to reduce his mortgage as fast as he can, to save and provide a pension for his wife, Zehavit. Last year he took a Standard Life Bank flexible repayment mortgage, which enables homeowners to pay off their loans early without penalty. Since then James has paid \u00a3160 a month more than he needs to. At this rate, he will have cleared his loan in 16 years rather than 25. He likes the fact that this type of mortgage allows homeowners to borrow back their overpayments. </p> <p>He is saving \u00a3200 a month in a Save As You Earn (SAYE) share option scheme. He has gradually increased his savings each year for the past three years from \u00a340 a month to \u00a3100 to \u00a3200. The first scheme matures next year. Other savings and investments include \u00a32,000 in BT shares which he bought last October. He has invested more in shares at other times. </p> <p>He has \u00a34,000 in an Egg account, invested over the internet, but is now looking for another internet savings account. He likes arranging his finances over the internet, which he can easily access at work or at home. </p> <p>He is considering opening a cash Isa with Smile, the Co-op's internet bank. He says he shies away from savings plans where you can't judge the value yourself, such as with-profits endowments. He likes investments that are completely transparent. </p> <p>He feels his own pension is 'sorted'. He has been a member of the BBC's final salary scheme for the past 18 months. Before that he was a member of money purchase schemes with three previous employers. However, he would like to start a pension for his wife. </p> <p>His debts include a per sonal loan taken out when he moved home last year, though he has already paid off most of it. Both he and his wife also have student loans. </p> <p>He met Zehavit on a kibbutz in Israel where he spent two years after graduating. She has recently completed an archaeology degree. She is a full-time mother but is considering self-employed work, or further studies at university. They plan to have more children.</p> <p><strong>Adviser 1: Andrew Jones</strong></p> <p>The balance between James's work and home life involves a personal decision that only he can make. If he wishes to continue saving and repaying his debts at the current rate, he will have to keep his current workload. </p> <p>Given the amount of his earnings relative to his outgoings, I am impressed that James is able to save as much as he does. He is right that a cash Isa is the most appropriate place for his cash savings, as this will shelter his money from tax. A maximum of \u00a33,000 can be invested in one of these Isas in the current tax year. He should also consider using his stocks and shares mini-Isa allowance of \u00a33,000 for longer-term investment.</p> <p>He could use his wife's Isa allowances to provide cash for her retirement.</p> <p>He is right in trying to repay his debts as soon as possible. He could use some of his maturing SAYE scheme money for that, too. However, he and his wife could keep their low-interest student loans.</p> <p>James's wish for a pension for Zehavit could be partly met by the new stakeholder regime, which starts next April. This allows up to \u00a33,600 to go into a scheme without evidence of earnings. This money would benefit from tax relief at 22 per cent and will grow in a virtually tax-free environment.</p> <p>James's \u00a3180,000 life insurance is adequate. But he should consider critical illness insurance as his earnings would be badly hit if he were seriously ill. </p> <p>\u0095 Andrew Jones works for chartered accountant Blick Rothenberg</p> <p><strong>Adviser 2: Gillian Cardy </strong></p> <p>James and Zehavit's mortgage allows them to reduce repayments if he decides to work less. He may have to save less, too, but he could maximise returns by rearranging his existing savings. </p> <p>For example, if cash deposits are made in Zehavit's name, she should register to receive interest without tax deducted, as long as she is a non-taxpayer. Maximum use should be made of Isa allowances. James is right that the Smile mini-cash Isa has one of the highest interest rates. However, to invest in a mini-cash Isa would limit his potential investment in a stocks and shares Isa to \u00a33,000.</p> <p>As he is interested in shares, he could open a maxi self-select Isa account instead. This would enable him to invest up to \u00a37,000 this year in shares or unit or investment trusts and make tax savings on any gains.</p> <p>Once his SAYE schemes have reached their end dates, he may consider other forms of saving, such as a monthly savings Isa or taking out a stakeholder pension for Zehavit.</p> <p>However, it is important to understand that money invested in a pension cannot be used until retirement. If they have more children, getting at their money could be important.</p> <p>I would be surprised if James's own pension really was 'sorted'. The amounts due at retirement may be less than he expects. And he may wish to consider critical illness cover. </p> <p>\u0095 Gillian Cardy works for financial adviser Professional Partnerships. </p> <p>Advice is for guidance only. </p> <p>\u0095 Do you want to appear in Wealthcheck?

  "<p>Health funding cuts, care in the community and telephone healthcare through NHS Direct may seem a world away from property development. But these changes in the way Britons receive medical treatment have made hospital buildings redundant and available for redevelopment, often as luxury flats for the healthy and wealthy. </p> <p>Developers like hospital sites. They are usually large, with potential for new buildings on the land as well as conversion of the older ones. They normally have good road links already in place, as well as traditional exteriors, which can add prestige and a premium price to the flats. </p> <p>The general hospital sites are often at the centre of existing communities, too, because most of the redundant buildings are replaced by state-of-the-art facilities on the edges of towns. This effectively leaves urban brownfield sites favoured by the Government and environmentalists. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the former mental institutions are often set in huge grounds in the country, a sign of the patronising Victorian attitude towards psychiatric conditions, but now an opportunity for large redevelopments involving mature gardens and outstanding views. </p> <p>The preservation of old hospital buildings has long occupied the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which in 1998 co-funded research into 120 Victorian and Edwardian hospitals that were empty or facing imminent closure (http://<a href=\"http://www.rics.org.uk\">www.rics.org.uk</a>). The RICS highlighted the potential dangers of sell-offs, fearing demolition or insensitive restoration. </p> <p>Three years earlier, English Heritage published a guide aimed at health authorities contemplating hospital sales, urging that although builders would find demolition an easy option, sellers should insist on preservation and sympathetic conversion. The body argued that many historic hospitals were not listed buildings, and the future of those outside the green belt could depend on profit alone. </p> <p>Unfortunately health service guidelines at the time emphasised the worst. A 1995 NHS Estates document, which is still in force, says: 'Once a property is declared surplus to operational needs the requirement is to sell the surplus property as soon as possible.' It advises health trusts to 'ensure that obsolete property is sold at the best price reasonably obtainable'. They should seek planning permission for conversion before putting a hospital on sale if that would boost the price. </p> <p>But developments in the past two years make it look as though pressure from the environmentalists has paid off. Although some health bodies still simply seek the best income, others insist on more sensitive restoration. </p> <p>Take Canterbury Fields, a collection of two-, three- and four-bedroom homes in the buildings that used to be Herne Hospital, near Canterbury. The main building began life in 1835 as a workhouse. It was converted into a hospital in the Thirties and extended when the NHS was founded in the Forties. </p> <p>Developer Saxon retained the main hospital building, but gutted and converted it. Homes there are selling for between \u00a380,000 and \u00a3200,000. 'The health authority was anxious to get rid of the buildings, which had been empty for some time, and the local authority obviously wanted listed status and conservation area issues taken into account,' says Saxon sales director Martin Macdonald. </p> <p>'To some extent it was typical of a lot of older hospitals. It had gone to rack and ruin and become a blot on the landscape, and no one could think of an obvious use for the site. Everyone was rather relieved that someone was mak ing something of it again,' he says. The conversion of hospitals into luxury apartments is not always the epitome of heartless twenty-first century capitalism that it might seem. Sometimes the conversions directly benefit the NHS. In Greenwich, south-east London, Persimmon Homes bought two hospital properties and land from Greenwich Healthcare NHS Trust in 1998 under the Government's private finance initiative. Funds from the sale went into the new Queen Elizabeth hospital in the borough. </p> <p>Occasionally a hospital property comes on the market before conversion and is suitable for an individual to purchase - if they can outbid the developers. Empty hospitals are physically obvious and offer huge potential, so developers make frequent calls to health authorities and trusts imploring them to sell redundant sites. As a result, chances for ordinary buyers to snap up a potential conversion are few. </p> <p>But part of the St Andrew's Hospital at Thorpe St Andrew, in Norfolk, is now being sold in its original condition, although potential buyers should note that it is currently owned by a the building company, which is developing the rest of the site. The firm now wants to sell the hospital chapel 'for buyers to create their own environment', as the estate agents' particulars put it. It is a character property with Gothic Victorian features and planning permission for conversion to a four-bedroom house. Plans for the conversion have been drawn up by the sellers and come with the property, which is on sale through FPD Savills at \u00a3125,000 (tel 01603 229229). </p> <p>Completed conversions are now thick on the ground. One of the latest is Wyfold Court Mansion in Lancashire. It was built for Preston MP Edward Herman in the 1880s, but for most of its life served as Borroughcourt Hospital. It enters this century as a duplex of 11 luxury apartments now on sale through Hamptons estate agents. </p> <p>These are the latest examples of distinctive homes on sites that have outlived their usefulness - a sad end for a well-loved hospital, perhaps, but at least these conversions breathe new life into some of the finest public health buildings in the country.</p>",
  "<p>Last August, my wife and I bought two sofas from Courts on a one-year interest-free option. This was a \u00a31,204 credit arrangement with HFC Bank, paid through 12 small monthly instalments, with a lump sum payment at the end of the year. </p> <p>Recently we received a statement noting an outstanding balance of \u00a365.40 for credit protection insurance, which HFC said I had taken out with the original credit agreement. I checked the application form. There was no tick and I had written 'N/A' next to the box. </p> <p>I had completed this form in the shop, where I was also given a personal loan voucher, completed by a Courts employee, which I signed, assuming it just repeated my application form. I now see that the insurance box on the voucher had been ticked. </p> <p>I don't doubt for a minute that I was wrong not to be more vigilant in checking what I signed, but surely I am being askedto pay for someone else's error?<br><strong>JM, London</strong> </p> <p>HFC says the two forms refer to applications for two different types of credit, but the deal was that you took both. The form you completed yourself was for a Courts store card, which you threw away; the other, for the personal loan, had the ticked insurance box. </p> <p>The salesman should have assumed you wanted identical conditions, or at least checked with you, but he earned no financial incentive by ticking the box on your behalf. </p> <p>HFC is happy to accept that you did not want the insurance and has cancelled the policy. You have paid for the sofas in full, and will not get caught by interest charges. </p> <p><strong> AA membership: Unused cover</strong></p> <p>On 3 April, I sent a cheque for \u00a375 to renew my AA membership, due at the end of April. But before the end of the month, I bought a new car that included three years' AA cover. </p> <p>I asked for a refund but was told that subscriptions are accepted for 12 months' continuous membership and are not refundable. Can you help me obtain my \u00a375, which I feel the AA is retaining on rather shaky arguments?<br><strong>WB, Harrogate</strong> </p> <p>Older AA membership cards show the exact day for renewal, but current ones indicate only the month and year. So, although you believed your subscription ran to the end of the month, the AA says it was due on 20 April, and you telephoned to cancel on the 28th. </p> <p>The money would have been refunded if the year had not yet started, but no refunds are allowed once it has. The only consolation is that the AA defers the unused portion until you want to reactivate it, so you will get 358 unused days of the subscription at this year's rate, however much the fee has increased. </p> <p><strong> Cooling off: The cold reality</strong></p> <p>I took out an Aberdeen unit trust Isa for \u00a35,000 but cancelled within the 14-day period. Instead of sending me back all the money, they have sent \u00a34,382, pointing to other documen tation that contradicts the wording on the cancellation form: 'I require the return of any money paid to you ...which I am entitled to have returned.'<br><strong>MR, Birmingham</strong> </p> <p>This cancellation clause can be read two ways and Aberdeen's interpretation differs from yours. </p> <p>You put emphasis on the word 'entitled' and believed you should get back all the money you paid over. Aberdeen emphasises the word 'which' and says you are entitled only to the lower price if units have fallen since you bought and your original investment if the price has risen. This is standard industry practice. </p> <p><strong> Children's funds: Perfect timing</strong></p> <p>Through my financial adviser, Willis National, I have put a few thousand pounds into the Mercury Global Titan fund in my name, but identified with the initials of my grandchild, aged six months. </p> <p>The key features document says that, when I die, the value can be released only by a grant of probate. If this coincided with, say, a teenager going to college, the delay in obtaining cash could be disruptive. Is there a better long-term investment for a grandchild that can be added to without penalty and has tax advantages?<br><strong>LT, Solihull </strong> </p> <p>The risk of your dying just as your grandchild starts university in 18 years' time is remote enough not to worry about. Over such a long period, investments linked to stock markets are the best choice and, by designating the account with the child's name, you have already min imised income tax. The simplest alternative is to put the money entirely in the child's name, but you would lose control. </p> <p>You could put some of the money in your wife's or another grandparent's name to spread the risk of one dying at a critical time. Otherwise, wait until the child reaches 15 and then move the money into a deposit account, perhaps a joint account with the child. </p> <p>Banks and building societies will release accounts worth up to \u00a35,000 without waiting for probate when a saver dies. Joint savings automatically go to the survivor. </p> <p><strong> Late mortgage? No worries</strong></p> <p>My wife and I own our own home, worth about \u00a340,000. We would like to borrow \u00a324,000 to move house. I am 57 and self-employed, earning about \u00a314,000 a year. My wife will retire in two years' time, aged 60, with full state pension. Is it unrealistic to think we could get a mortgage for this additional money?<br><strong>PK, Glasgow</strong> </p> <p>You should have no problem. While your income is low, you are borrowing less than 2.5 times your salary and can put down a large deposit. Your age is not an issue as you are still working and could perhaps work beyond 65. In fact, you may find that \u00a325,001 is the least you can borrow, as this is the starting point for most lenders. </p> <p>A repayment loan is best as you do not have enough time for investments to grow substantially. Borrowing \u00a325,001 at 6 per cent over 13 years costs \u00a3235 a month; over eight years \u00a3335. </p> <p>\u0095 Write to Margaret Dibben, Money Writes, The Observer, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER and include a telephone number.

  "<p>Well, they made it. Despite the worst intentions of Thatcher and the best of Scargill, trade unions have survived into the twenty-first century. Today marks the start of their first Congress of the new millennium, and, on one level at least, there's a feeling that they're on a roll. </p> <p>Along with a raft of helpful legislation, last year they saw membership rise for the first time in two decades. The gain was substantial - 100,000 people joined unions in 1999, taking membership to 6.8 million. </p> <p>But there is a problem. According to the Trades Union Congress, the additions were in solid core constituencies - the public sector, teaching, manufacturing. A strengthening of the unions' traditional support base may bring cheers from branches around the country. But is this relevant to their future? Silence. </p> <p>Unions are seen as old organisations, in all the worst associations of the word. They are Old Labour. They are Old Economy. And they are made up of old people - the average age of UK union members is 46; the average age of all workers is just 34. </p> <p>John Monks, general secretary of the TUC, says: 'At the moment I think of little else. The whole future of trade unions depends on us demonstrating our value in new sectors. We can't just rest on our traditional heartlands of manufacturing and the public sector.' </p> <p>In July a seminar called Organising in the Network Economy was held by Union Network International, a Geneva-based umbrella organisation claiming affiliation from 15 million union members in 920 unions worldwide. It aims to encourage growth into high technology sectors. </p> <p>UNI's general secretary, Philip Jennings, says: 'The changes that information technology is bringing to the relationships between companies and their staff are creating firmer management and supervision, with less security. It is a massive transformation.' </p> <p>As UNI admits, the first problem is finding a clear starting point. There are few statistics revealing the penetration of unions into new-economy companies, some of which are hostile. </p> <p>'New organisations - Microsoft, Vodafone, anything owned by Rupert Murdoch - are very anti-union and determined to keep them out,' says Jennings. </p> <p>Older companies that start separate operations, such as mobile telecoms businesses, tend to set them up at arms length, free of union involvement. And the profile of their workforces is changing, too. A UNI paper states: 'Companies are churning their work forces... hiring younger people with more modern qualifications rather than retraining incumbent staff.' The physical environment of the new economy - greenfield offices or call centres - is a further barrier. </p> <p>Call centres burgeoned in the Nineties, with growth rates in the US and Europe of 30 to 40 per cent, and 100,000 jobs a year being created in Europe. The UK has led the way; 45 per cent of European call-centre capacity is located here. Call-centre operatives are forecast to outnumber teachers and farmers by 2002. </p> <p>Dai Davies, of financial services union Unifi, says: 'It is very hard to get into these places, and if you do, it is very difficult to talk to employees because supervision is so strict.' </p> <p>The problem for Unifi is growing as bank branches - membership strongholds - are closed. Membership has dropped from about 200,000 five years ago (in the three unions that formed Unifi) to 180,000 now - of whom 10,000 are in call centres. </p> <p>UNI says: 'A redundant worker who was a union member is invariably being replaced by a younger worker who is not a union member.' And it points out that membership among young workers is falling alarmingly. In Sweden, for example, the proportion of young unionised workers in 1993 was 62 per cent; by 1999 it was 47 per cent. </p> <p>Unions are also concerned that the growth in demand for IT professionals - the EU predicts a 1.7 million shortfall by 2003 - has led countries in the UK and the US to look to 'import' skilled workers from places such as India and Asia. Not only does this show that governments accept that companies are not prepared to retrain existing, possibly unionised workers, it creates another economically important group that has no traditional attachment to unions. </p> <p>But do new-economy employees need to organise? Of course, say the unions. The virtues of the new economy - flexibility, speed, opportunity - are virtues only to employers. To employees, they are vices - insecurity, intrusion, stress. </p> <p>Unions may be shunted out as old companies set up new businesses. But this provides unions a way into the new organisations - by tracking the former employees. The Communication Wor kers Union, nearly half of whose 280,000 members came from BT and other telecoms or engineering backgrounds, has been tracking members as BT has fragmented. </p> <p>'We have had to identify and follow the membership,' says Jeannie Drake, CWU deputy general secretary. 'First we look to those who leave BT, and try to get recognition in companies where they go. So, for example, CWU has recognition agreements in parts of telecoms groups such as Nortel, Global Crossing and Corning Cables. We also have to go into areas BT has bought into - such as retailer DX Communications.' </p> <p>But there remains an uncomfortably long list of 'priority targets', from big mobile-phone operators such as Vodafone and Orange, through cable companies and bigger internet operations. The CWU points to legislation - particularly the Employ ment Relations Act, which gives unions legal rights to recognition and to represent employees in grievances - as levers for breaking into new businesses. </p> <p>But it will be difficult. Five years ago the CWU had 160,000 members in telecoms - 150,000 in BT. Now it has 110,000, with 70,000 in BT. The erosion of the state monopoly has eaten away at union membership. </p> <p>This would all be very depressing if it were not for recent successful union action in the US - particularly a campaign by the CWU's counterpart, the Communication Workers of America. The CWA represented 35,000 employees at Verizon, a US telecoms company, who went on strike for two weeks last month over pay and conditions of work. </p> <p>The strike gave the CWA massive exposure and raised the issue of the power of unions within the new economy in the free-market US. But the terms of the settlement were as interesting as the dispute itself. It estab lished the right of workers to organise in the wireless division of Verizon - partly owned by Vodafone. As one influential American commentator remarked: 'Their willingness to strike, not over current workers' wages or benefits, but over the future of hi-tech unionism, suggests a new chapter in labour relations and a surprising foothold in the information economy.' </p> <p>Jeff Miller of the CWA says: 'We have been extremely aggressive in targeting new economy companies and trying to represent what employees want. There is clearly a demand for organisation and union representation in the new economy, and we are beginning to get that message through.'. </p> <p>Its tactics seem to be working. Since 1995 union membership among US workers has fallen from 15.5 per cent to 13.9 per cent. But the CWA has seen its membership rise, by 20 per cent. It now stands at around 630,000 - 500,000 of whom are in telecoms and 'new' sectors. Future targets include MCI Worldcom and internet companies such as Amazon. </p> <p>The Verizon action is just one of a number of disputes that indicate that IT workers are organising. Jennings points to a 47-day strike by 18,000 computer technician and engineer members of the Society of Professional Engineering Employees at Boeing, triggered by a pay dispute. It was the largest white-collar dispute since the war. </p> <p>And unions are using the internet to organise themselves, running 'e-campaigns' and 'cyberpickets', where unions pressurise companies to update members on the progress of disputes and get petitions and protests signed via the net. Canada's Communication, Energy and Paper Workers Union (CEP) has 'cyberpicketed' the Calgary Herald newspaper - formerly owned by Conrad Black - over contract terms. </p> <p>The Washington Alliance of Technology Workers (WashTec) grew out of the software industry around Microsoft because of insecurity created by short-term contracts. </p> <p>It has 250 members in Microsoft and an online news service with 2,000 subscribers. Its aims are to 'work to make sick pay, holiday pay and decent medical coverage basic workplace rights'. A similar organisation exists at IBM, called Alliance@IBM. </p> <p>Joel Yudken, head of policy at the AFL-CIO, the national union federation, says: 'In the US the labour movement has turned a corner. Professionals in places like Verizon and Boeing are speaking out. In the new economy you see a feeling of growing insecurity. They are beginning to look to unions to help.' That is what lies behind CWA's increase. </p> <p>The UK's communications union certainly wants to emulate its US cousins. In five years' time it hopes that the majority of its members will be outside BT, and that membership will have passed the 160,000 level of five years ago. But will enough workers answer its call? </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:oliver.morgan@observer.co.uk\">oliver.morgan@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Ever felt a tad claustrophobic when you squeeze your legs beneath your office desk? In the workplace of the future, you will simply stand up and press a button to raise its surface to your height. </p> <p>And if you can't quite get those creative juices flowing in your head, then a quick twirl in translucent egg-shaped chairs suspended from the office ceiling may do the trick. The only people with fixed desks are the 'floor managers', who used to be secretaries and who will enforce the 'out for more than two hours and you clear your desk' rule. All other workers have a 'hutch' - a pine-finished filing cabinet on wheels that is dragged to your desk for the afternoon. </p> <p>Throw in deliveries of fresh organic fruit and it all begins to sound like the stories of excess and 'funky business' emanating from lavishly funded dotcom start-ups. </p> <p>But these measures are just part of the development of northern Europe's largest single office complex. Telenor, the Norwegian equivalent of British Telecom, is rehousing 6,000 office staff from 40 locations around Oslo in a futuristic central site being built at the city's old airport in Fornebu. </p> <p>At the end of the runway there will be an outdoor plaza flanked on either side by dramatic curved glass facades. 'It's a strategic look at new ways of working and interacting,' says Trond Bentestuen of Telenor. </p> <p>Building design has shifted from private to shared workspace and to drawing in the outside environment. Where management maxims once dictated tall buildings, large reception areas and private offices with expensive ephemera as symbols of power, new thinking dictates knowledge-sharing and getting close to employees. Even the managing director of Telenor Business Systems has a hutch. </p> <p>Telenor, involved in telephones, mobile networks, engineering and media, needs to be at the cutting edge. Formerly disparate businesses now increasingly overlap and need to work in concert but retain their identity. </p> <p>Environmental considerations are important both for the welfare of workers - no desk will be more than six metres from a window - and in themselves. Eighty per cent of the complex's energy requirements will be met from using Oslo Fjord's seawater. The orientation of the complex is in keeping with the direction of the glacier that carved out the fjord. </p> <p>'We sense that the business environment is changing - the people we want are no longer desperate for jobs,' says a senior Telenor executive. He points to studies outlining a shift from the 'nine-to-five' employee to the 'nine-month-a-year' worker. 'The vision here is to share knowledge and information. Work at home when you want to concentrate, and at the office when you want to share.' </p> <p>The bonus ball of flexibility is that it allows more efficient use of desk space. </p> <p>'The office is really a twentieth-century device - an artificial box where workers process information,' says Jeremy Myerson of the Helen Hamlyn research centre at the Royal College of Art. 'Now you can do this anywhere. As meeting and exchanging knowledge have become more important, so has looking at offices as a social landscape.' </p> <p>IT and telecoms are the most enthusiastic disciples of this cause. And the guinea pigs for this change are testing out the new arrangement. 'People feel better - you don't have to arrange meetings so formally,' says one employee. </p> <p>But Myerson believes companies such as Telenor have other reasons for making such changes. 'Corporate headquarters are now marketing tools, he says. 'As many of these offices use the products the whole office becomes a giant advert.'</p>",
  "<p>Are you a Bobo? A bourgeois bohemian? Bobo is a word you won't yet find in any dictionary, the happy inspiration of an American journalist, David Brooks, author of Bobos in Paradise: The New Upper Class and How They Got There (Simon &amp; Schuster) and it springs from Brooks's observation that it is no longer as easy as it used to be to distinguish between the bourgeois world of capitalism and the bohemian counterculture. </p> <p>Once, if you were bourgeois, you wore a dark suit, probably worked for a corporation, and had life insurance. If you were bohemian, you were an artist and an intellectual, and knew about the avant-garde. Bohemians wore blue jeans and championed the values of the liberated Sixties. Your average bourgeois was the gung-ho yuppie of the Eighties and the Age of Greed. </p> <p>Interestingly enough, both 'bourgeois' and 'avant-garde' are words that have, of late, rather dropped from the lexicon. And, to finish with Brooks's insight into the way we live now, the bohemian and the bourgeois are all mixed up. </p> <p>You cannot, he says, readily distinguish an espresso-sipping professor from a cappuccino-gulping banker. More, he argues that these bobos are a new \u00e9lite that combines the values of the countercultural Sixties with those of the high-achieving Eighties. These, he says, are the people who now set the pace, and the tone, of American society. Their hybrid culture has infiltrated all walks of life, and all areas of mass consumption. He doesn't say this, but Democratic presidential hopeful Al Gore is Bobo-in-Chief with his support for the internet and the environment. </p> <p>Brooks is clever, but he's not intellectual, and he's not much exercised by the phenomenon he's describing. 'I just went out,' he writes, 'and tried to describe how people are living, using a method that might best be described as comic sociology.' </p> <p>Brooks is writing about America, and very entertaining he is, too, in a Wolfe-ish, O'Rourke-ish, Buckley-esque sort of way. Equally troubled by a similar changing of the guard in Britain, but much less enjoyably so, is George Walden, disappointed man and former Tory MP. The New Elites: Making A Career in the Masses (Allen Lane \u00a318.99) is a lengthy and rather muddled whinge about what Walden sees as a new oligarchy of professional egalitarians, and their populist 'corruption' of the pure well of British culture.</p> <p>That's not all. Where Brooks is judgment-light in his assessment of Bobo values and freely admits that 'Max Weber has nothing to worry about from me', Walden is a prodigious name-dropper. A blizzard of allusion - to Kierkegaard, Flaubert, De Lillo, Arnold and William Morris - assails the reader in the first 20 pages. Shortly after, Walden abandons the quasi-journalistic tone of his opening and launches into a mini-lecture about 'the so-called classical \u00e9litists' Vilfredo Pareto, Robert Michels and Gaetano Mosca.</p> <p>Although later he loosens up to take on the Dome, Channel 5 and the Booker Prize, here, in a nutshell, is the fundamental problem with his book. Briefly, it never decides whether it's an opinionated polemic against Tony Blair's New Labour establishment or a Tocquevillean treatise about representative democracy in the age of mass media. A prevailing tone of withering contempt ('To every fool is given his morsel of wisdom') and the absence of index, bibliography or footnotes tells us that Walden sees his efforts as essayistic.</p> <p>Simultaneously, the sophomoric references to Fourier, Heidegger, Kundera, Nietzsche and Koestler remind us that Walden wants to pass, at least in Conservative circles, as an intellectual, an author of gravitas and learning. Or, as David Brooks might put it, he seems to want to be both bohemian and bourgeois. Some candid friend should take him to one side with a quiet word about the difficulty of being at once racy and respectable. </p> <p>Walden's complaint about the crassness of contemporary cultural endeavour in the age of New Labour is more bilious than Brooks's but in other respects he is part of a trend, at least in Britain. These past few weeks have seen the publication of a number of grumpy jeremiads from a grouch of retired and/or deposed culture tsars, each of whom wants to say that in the age of the Bobo our culture is going to hell in a handbasket. </p> <p>Next to Walden, there's John Tusa's Art Matters (Methuen \u00a312.99) which feuds with Melvyn Bragg while wringing its hands over the cretinisation of cultural life. Another former BBC man, John Drummond, has also pitched into the fray with some spinsterish remarks about Nigel Kennedy in his door-stopping memoir Tainted by Experience (Faber \u00a325). </p> <p>The difficulty with taking this apr\u00e8s nous, le d\u00e9luge stuff seriously, as Professor John Sutherland recently pointed out, is that these writers are all into their bus pass years. Why doesn't some enterprising Bobo publisher commission a lively New Labour journalist to critique the supposed cultural crisis from a position of knowledge, sympathy and understanding? </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:robert.mccrum@observer.co.uk\">robert.mccrum@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>There is a line in Muriel Spark's new novel, Aiding and Abetting (her twenty-first) which gave me a shock of recognition when I read it, so neatly might it apply to the author herself: '[She] had long felt that sentimentality was a luxury she could not afford.' </p> <p>'It could be true.' Dame Muriel rearranges herself on the sofa and considers. 'I have sometimes thought that.' </p> <p>Others have noted it too, over her 50-year writing career, this lack of sentiment, and have called it coldness or ruthlessness. Miss Jean Brodie called it dedication ('You must all grow up to be dedicated women,' she tells her girls). Spark's co-religionist and former patron Graham Greene pinpointed the same quality in different words: 'There is a splinter of ice in the heart of a writer.' </p> <p>In person, she is charming, with shrewd, smiling eyes and careful, dark-red lipstick that matches her hair. She offers me coffee, invites me to admire the exuberant flowers her publisher has sent to cheer up the small room of her genteel hotel, is very concerned with my tape recorder and whether it's working properly. She might be 82, but don't make the mistake of talking to her as if she's an old lady. </p> <p>'Do you get to travel much these days?' I realise before I've finished the question how patronising it sounds. Spark draws herself up slightly and replies: 'This is my third trip to London this year and I'm coming back in October. But we nearly didn't get here because of those French fishermen.' </p> <p>Sitting across from her, leafing through recent reviews and cuttings, is Penelope Jardine, Spark's friend and companion of more than 20 years; it is Penelope who does the driving to and from the converted Tuscan presbytery they share when not travelling, and Penelope who, rather like Mrs Tennyson, takes care of the practical side of life while Spark is writing and researching, Penelope who types up Spark's manuscripts, all written in long-hand in special notebooks she orders from the Edinburgh stationer James Thin.</p> <p>Occasionally, Spark appeals to Penelope to corroborate a story or back up an opinion - 'I think it's not as hard for women writers to get noticed these days - what do you think, Pen? You always say women writers have a bad deal.' 'Do I?' 'Yes, you do.' </p> <p>'Someone's got you down here as a single mother,' Penelope remarks, looking up from her cuttings, 'meaning you weren't married when you had a baby.' </p> <p>'Well, I was virtually a single mother,' Spark cries, indignantly, 'he was absolutely abandoned by his father!' </p> <p>Her critics might find this accusation a little disingenuous. Spark's relationship with her son, Robin, appears always to have been unorthodox. Her husband, Sydney Oswald, whom she married at 19 having emigrated to join him in Rhodesia, began to show signs of mental illness not long after the child's birth and was eventually interned in an institution; Muriel filed for divorce and, keen to experience the war in Europe at first-hand, left little Robin in a convent while she braved the voyage back to England on a troop ship. When her son joined her the following year, he went to live with her parents in Edinburgh, while Spark continued her war work for the Foreign Office, broadcasting subtle anti-Nazi propaganda and false information to German troops. </p> <p>She was writing poetry in Rhodesia, but her literary career was launched in 1951, when she submitted a short story to a competition in The Observer and won first prize out of nearly 7,000 entries. 'You had to send it under a pseudonym,' she remembers, 'and put your real name inside. It was Philip Toynbee who opened it, and he was quite surprised to find that it was by a woman. I don't know if that's a compliment or not. But that was a great moment. The New Yorker gave me a party.' </p> <p>A publishing contract followed, and Spark's career took her to New York. But the relationship with her son attracted attention again two years ago, when Robin, an artist and an Orthodox Jew who still lives in Edinburgh, suddenly flourished his grandparents' marriage certificate which, he claimed, disproved Muriel's assertion that her mother was not Jewish. Muriel, naturally, countered with characteristic energy and defiance; a letter of 1998 to The Observer begins: 'Your report (last week) that I \"finally conceded\" that I was not born of a Jewish father and a Gentile mother, is wrong. I conceded no such thing. I do not need to prove anything, anyway.' </p> <p>'My mother falsified the marriage certificate so she could be married in a synagogue,' she says, her tone somewhere between weariness and protestation. 'I can't help it that she wasn't a Jew. When my son started playing up, I gave his letters to the National Library of Scotland, who handle my manuscripts. I think it's only right that people should know the truth, and his letters speak for themselves.' </p> <p>Perhaps Robin felt his mother was threatening the identity he had painstakingly constructed? </p> <p>'He thought I should have gone along with it and covered up,' she says, really quite affronted. 'I'd have done anything to make him a full Jew, but I wasn't going to lie! But I think he got annoyed because I pointed out that he was just pure damn jealous - he was very resentful of my success.' </p> <p>Identity is a crucial theme for Spark; you can imagine she would be resentful of anyone who tried to rewrite her own past. 'I'm a Catholic,' she says, 'but if people attack the Jews, then I do feel very Jewish. I think environment is the provocation.' </p> <p>She returns to the theme of literary success and jealousy. 'I'm a very bad picker of men. Obviously I didn't pick my son, but weak men can't cope with women who are successful, particularly if you're a writer, because your heart is always with the work, you exclude them. I've made three terrible mistakes - well, one was my husband and he was bonkers, so you can't count him. But the other two were writers, and they couldn't cope with my doing better than them. If you don't want that sort of treatment you should pick men who are more ambitious.' </p> <p>I'm nodding, perhaps too vigorously, and her eyes turn suddenly sharp. 'Are you married?' I tell her I'm not. 'Well, not to worry, you've plenty of time.' She smiles, with a touch of benevolence. It seems a curious comment from someone who speaks of her own marriage as 'disastrous', never considered remarrying and tells, quite matter-of-factly, of having had 'lots of affairs'. I ask how she endeavours to keep in touch with new generations of readers. </p> <p>'Ah, one can never be sure of that. You can only hope for the best - the thing is not to bore myself. I watch television, so I do know what's going on. We have Sky News, CNN and BBC World,' she says, proudly. </p> <p>She also reads contemporary fiction, when it's sent her way. On the coffee table is a proof of Toby Litt's forthcoming novel. 'Do you know this writer? Terribly good. Word of mouth matters more than reviews.' </p> <p>But does her semi-reclusive life in Italy mean that she is now obliged to draw on past experience and memory for her fiction? 'I've often wondered that - am I just left with my past? But no - the next novel I'm writing has nothing to do with my past. Well, only in the way that everything draws on your past to an extent, but this is a totally new thing.' </p> <p>It's only when a tentative boy arrives with more flowers that I glance at my watch and realise we've been talking for half an hour past the allotted time. 'Now that we've met,' she says, getting to her feet, 'you must come and visit us in Italy, we'd love that, wouldn't we, Pen?' Dame Muriel may not be sentimental, she may be single-minded, unflinching and possessed of a wit that slices like cheesewire, but her splinter of ice is hidden under a warm and generous exterior.</p>",
  "A slight frisson is tingling through the marrow of English bones with a demographer's report that, let's says, in Greater London, and certainly many inner cities, whites will be in a minority in the next 25 years or so. <p>This was greeted in some quarters with alarm. Race has returned to the national agenda and those who identify themselves exclusively by the colour of their skin have found this rather unpalatable. The barbarians are at the gates; cultural values and habits of the outsider threaten a way of life based on white racial superiority. </p> <p>No need to panic. With a settled immigrant population demonstrating an ease of presence and dissolving into different classes, who is to say that the black and Asian middle classes and upper echelons of the working classes would not be migrating in droves to the rural areas of England? It is already a fact of life that the white middle classes are repopulating the inner cities. </p> <p>I take my street and its surrounds as an example. There is a steady drift of white professionals into black Brixton, the south London home for so many of the Windrush generation. BBC personnel, architects, doctors, journalists and the rest are moving in where the traditional Caribbean population drifts to the outer city districts of Thornton Heath and Croydon. The old Notting Hill of my youth, the Grove as we rechristened it then, is no more. </p> <p>Here in Brixton along Coldharbour Lane, a sushi bar, an upmarket hairdressers, a juice bar adorned with shelves of secondhand intellectual tomes and the hedonistic Dogstar bar nestle side by side with Junior's Minicab and Jamaican takeaways. Perhaps this phenomenon is too recent for inclusion in the report. The alternative is too bizarre to contemplate - that the demographer's study is mischief on a grand scale. </p> <p>So much has rolled away with time. The old England that I met here some 40 years ago is dead. Colonial pomposity and imperial cruelty have been severely undermined to the point of oblivion. There is no economic basis for this phenomenon. National capital has been dissolved into global capital, drawing into its wake an international population now at ease in England. </p> <p>Let me detail the life of an immigrant 40 years ago. We lived on tenterhooks, unsure of a permanent presence in this tiny place. Every step was haunted by suspicion of what lurked behind an employer's door or, for that matter, the neighbour's door. We chose to work a particular shift when word went around the factory that the foreman was sympathetic to blacks. </p> <p>If we walked into a public place to shop or for leisure, we made a beeline for a black employee who would smooth our way usually hindered by prejudice. After 10pm or so, we would hardly ever walk the streets alone, but always in twos or threes. We avoided certain institutions - pubs, cinemas - unless there was a guaranteed black presence. </p> <p>We kept to ourselves, herded against what we perceived to be the enemy, in illegal basement clubs. We avoided banks, plumped for post offices and that traditional way of saving, the 'partner'. Each member would contribute X number of pounds and draw a hand of X hundred pounds. There we found the down payment to purchase houses. </p> <p>There was an immense solidarity then and each step, every move, was haunted by the overwhelming racial prejudice which dominated the landscape. Huge energies were trapped in an isolated way of life in which police malpractice was a major feature. </p> <p>Things began to loosen with the new generation, which was as comfortable with toad in the hole as it was with fish and chips. School, and school dinners, drew us out of isolation and into a direct social relation with whites. This proximity prompted huge demands for racial equality, especially when the American black power movement began to stalk the international stage. </p> <p>The riots of 1981, which appeared on the surface only as mass destruction, concealed another much more important factor - a major escape from the isolation of the generation which preceded it. In the last 20 years, we have appeared alongside whites in places hitherto reserved for whites only. There are black and Asian faces on the television screens, police officers of rank, leaders of trade unions, bishops and vicars, scribes and novelists, teachers and managers. You name it, we occupy it. And the demand for more is on the agenda as never before. </p> <p>The myth of white superiority and its engaging partner - black incompetence - has taken a huge beating in this move ment. Colour of skin is becoming less a determinant of capability. It merges at a moment in history where class superiority is being undermined by a new meritocracy. We are not alone in ringing these massive changes out of the old establishment. La lutta continua . </p> <p>Side by side with these changes exists the opposite - the desperate attempt to cling on to the old. This ease of presence which characterises the new black and Asian population means we are less and less given to the solidarity of skin. The basement has given way to the disco. We are out of the closet of the past and are strutting our stuff. We are not only part of the banking system, but managing banks as well. </p> <p>But the greatest of all changes has been wrought by the Lawrences, Doreen and Neville. They have almost singlehandedly, upon the murder of their son, exposed the deep flaws in one of the most important institutions of state, shattering the myth of the British bobby. Their latest recruit is none other than our future king. </p> <p>And the backlash is also on the agenda. There is the horrified reaction by some to the recent demographer's report. There is the charge that black boys are recalcitrant and offensive; not that they are the leading lights in the world of leisure! And it is now being said of the Notting Hill Carnival - so beautifully conceived in the imagination of Caribbean people and now transcended by universality - that it is no longer an asset but a violent humbug. </p> <p>Those who say that also hold that the engaging presence of blacks on television is not an advance, not an inspiration, but a result of vulgar and positive discrimination. Add to that the cases of the police officers who are now openly issuing racial threats to their black superiors. </p> <p>In the press, the Daily Mail in the main leads the assault with back-up from its London stablemate, the Evening Standard, and the Daily Telegraph . Only a few days ago, Max Hastings, a former editor of the Telegraph and now the editor of the Evening Standard, in writing about Michael Heseltine's autobiography, chose to tell this tale. </p> <p>Heseltine, in his work on the regeneration of the inner cities, convinced a bank manager in Liverpool to employ a couple of blacks. When Heseltine inquired about their progress some time after, one of them had robbed the bank with a shotgun and the other stole \u00a31,000. I had heard the same story from the lips of a stand-up comedian. </p> <p>And so we have it: huge changes in a modern society and a desperate, but vain, bid by the old to restore times past, over and done with.</p>",
  "<p>Eliza Carthy, catalytic converter of English folk music, has been leading a double life. For the past three years, the fiddle player and singer has been writing a pop album on the quiet. Carthy, just turned 25, was signed to Warner Bros as a singer-songwriter in 1997 by the A&amp;R man who signed Joni Mitchell and Van Morrison. Since when she's got on with 'being a folkie', in pubs, in Peru, at Glastonbury and Meltdown, as Joan Baez's 'co-mentor' (Joan's word) and on tour with her famous folk parents, Norma Waterson and Martin Carthy. Only now their Liza shares the same PR woman as Madonna. </p> <p>'It's been a secret, my little thing,' she says, brushing crumbs off the table after late Sunday breakfast. Today Liza's hair, usually blue, is green. On the windowsill, Buffy the goldfish is circling to the sound of US popster Pink. The neon purveyor of old English love songs lives in Scotland, in a converted stable south of Edinburgh, nothing but sheep for miles, Scottish boyfriend playing English pipes outside the front door. </p> <p>Angels and Cigarettes , like Carthy on stage, is seductively raw. Aside from a cover of Paul Weller's 'Wildwood', partly chosen so she could 'really belt on it' (she has a fabulous voice), this is Liza laid bare: the wrong blokes, the inadequacies, jealousies and, now she's found the right bloke, the fantasies. Her first songs were, she admits, 'completely unselfconscious'. One of them, 'Whole' - as in 'swallow you whole' - was inspired by 'a really nice thing' someone said to her in bed. In 'The Company of Men', a butter-wouldn't-melt harp intro gives way to: 'I've given blow jobs on couches/ To men who didn't want me any more.' Her dad wrote the tune to this one. </p> <p>Warners, to their credit, appear to have left the feisty former Mercury Prize nominee more or less to her own devices, their main proviso: no traditional music. There are Latin grooves, a 25-piece string section, but she plays fiddle on most tracks, the Yorkshire vowels are intact, and the odd folkism still slips out - the demon lover with 'a flush in his cheek' a 'lass' on the Tube. 'I was really quite paranoid when we started,' Carthy recalls. 'I was like, D'ya want me to go on a diet and learn how to formation dance? They were just looking at me totally bemused, \"Er, no and no\".' The music giant signed an elfin folk babe, however now 'voluptuous' would be more accurate. In the CD notes, she describes 'a period of not wanting to see skinny people doing anything'. She tells me she tries to imagine being on Top of the Pops , 'then I get embarrassed'. (I prefer the Liza who signs off her album credits 'Grrrr!! Aaaargh!!!') Has anyone asked her to lose weight? 'No.'</p> <p>She seems too happy to really care. Liza and boyfriend Ben Ivitsky, fiddle player with the Peatbog Faeries, are learning to play the pipes together (brand new ones made of cherry wood: 'D'ya wanna sniff?'). Ben, also a guitarist, 'wrote most of the album' with her. He gave her a pep talk about 'The Blow Job Song' (its working title): 'You're saying things other women wouldn't say,' he told her. 'You're gonna scare the shit out of loads of blokes.' When I leave the room, they start singing together. </p> <p>Carthy belongs to a musical dynasty. She's sitting beneath a photo of her auntie, Lal Waterson, who wrote two acclaimed albums before her death two years ago. There's a pin-up of Martin Carthy, Sixties folk star, in the loo. And yet the prodigal daughter is about to abandon the family business. </p> <p>'But I'm not,' she hits back. 'My physical output will just totally refute that.' She has just produced her mum's first solo traditional album ('I'm all over that'). She'll still gig with her parents. She plans to set up a production company putting out traditional music and tune books for schools (at this point, Vera Lynn is sailing out of the speakers) and she wants to get traditional instruments into the classroom: 'Kids should be learning to play the bagpipes and the hurdy-gurdy,' she proclaims, brown eyes wide, 'they should be freaking out and clog dancing!' </p> <p>Warners may have signed themselves a Trojan horse with bells on. 'Well what am I gonna do? Am I gonna languish in obscurity going, \"I'm bringing folk music to a wider audience\"? Or am I actually gonna do something about it, use this fortunate signing to satisfy my need for new things, and also my need to get traditional music out into the world?' She's been working the folk circuit since she was 17. 'I'd like to prove to myself that I can do an entirely different job.' </p> <p>She will tour later this year purely as a singer-songwriter. As a consumer, she is 'uncomfortable' listening to them. Flicking through her CDs, she picks out Ben Harper, Ani Di Franco and Beth Orton as exceptions. She 'gets off on' bands: G. Love and Special Sauce, The Prodigy, Little Feat, The Meters, Beck. In alphabetical order, though. 'I don't know what Shaggy's doing in the bloody Bs...' Carthy has a soft spot for Catatonia - and The Corrs. Maybe she's learnt from their fiddle-lite appeal: she says she wants to make folk her 'gimmick' rather than her 'hindrance'. </p> <p>You can see her dilemma. A twentysomething folk singer in the twenty-first century does not compute with most people. Female singer-songwriters who talk dirty (P.J. Harvey, Alanis Morissette, Tori Amos) do. There follows a major rant against one-dimensional Britain - 'Ibiza and Radio 1 and finding out what the fuckin' celebs are up to' - and the fact that if traditional music, 'something I love', goes any more underground, it'll be dead. </p> <p>'We should be getting grants off the Government!' she rails, 'I've been all over the world talking about England and what a fucking great place it is, and people have to keep leaving the folk scene.' Her brother-in-law Saul Rose has just hung up his melodeon. He is now a pharmacist. 'Or you can do what I did,' she says, increasingly anguished, 'work your arse off driving yourself around, getting yourself a record deal, making yourself ill. Unless you do this, you haven't a hope in hell. It's so sad.' Top of the Pops is the least of her worries. </p> <p>Still, a girl's got to get her merchandise right. She wants a 'skate' look, she tells her manager, and shows him her new logo - Liza as an angel with a jaunty halo. So there is life after folk. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Angels and Cigarettes is out on WEA on 18 September</p>",
  "<p>Domain names are seen as the new real estate. A strong one helps to guide internet users to a company's website, which is why they can sell for the sort of fortunes made when the property market is soaring. </p> <p>The domain name year2000 fetched $10 million recently, while business.com went for $7m. The UK owner of ebuy.com claims he turned down a similar sum for his domain name. The owner of America.com is offering it to anyone prepared to pay $30m. </p> <p>But experts are warning that many punters shelling out for names they believe will bring them riches are facing nothing but embarrassment and disappointment. The problem is that an increasing number of so-called domain names are not what they seem. Wily internet companies have started selling what are known as 'sub-domain' names, which cannot be registered and are largely worthless. </p> <p>The sharp practice has been given impetus by Icann, the Internet Corporation for Assigned News and Numbers, the world body which oversees the allocation of domain names on a not-for-profit basis. It is poised at its current meeting in Japan to ratify a new batch of domain name identities, known as 'Top Level Domains' (TLDs) because they are recognised globally. Typically, these include names ending in either .com, signifying a commercial web address, or .org, signifying a public organisation. Most of these have been bought up, and there is still huge untapped demand. Hence the batch of new names. </p> <p>These will eventually include the suffix '.eu', an important signifier for companies wishing to show customers that they have a European presence. </p> <p>However, the suffix has created confusion, - and internet firms have cashed in. One, CentralNic.com, bought 'www.eu.com' for an undisclosed sum, and is selling two-year licences to 'own' names such as Harrods.eu.com and Microsoft.eu.com at \u00a380 each. Yet the addresses offered are not acknowledged as true domain names by the internet's official registration agencies. These agencies will recognise only those TLD names that end in '.eu' - for instance www.Microsoft.eu, rather than '.eu.com'. </p> <p>All of the names for sale are registered with CentralNic's important-sounding 'Global domain names registry'. However, it has no official standing as a registry. Buyers of the subdomains simply have their names entered in its database. CentralNic is lobbying to have subdomain names recognised by Icann, for obvious commercial reasons, but for now this remains only a remote possibility. </p> <p>Other names that have been offered for sale by CentralNic include those with Ford, Ferrari, Marks &amp; Spencer and Barclays before the eu.com suffix. The company also owns 16 other TLD names, including us.com, uk.com and gb.com, allowing it to rent out further sets of sub-domain names. </p> <p>Another company which acts as an agent for CentralNic, named 123.com, is also selling addresses ending in '.eu.com' for \u00a369 each. Those for sale on its website include the titles of large companies, such as Hilton Hotels, Pepsi-Cola, Microsoft and Virgin, as well as the Nationwide building society. </p> <p>CentralNic claims to have a network of 300 dealers licensed to sell its wares. </p> <p>Many subdomain names have already been bought up, some by CentralNic's staff. But any punters looking to buy names and sit on them in in the hope that the firms involved will agree to buy them - a practice known as 'cyber-squatting' - are likely to end up out of pocket. Marks &amp; Spencer, for example, says it will take legal action if the name Marks&amp;Spencer.eu.com is sold or used for a website. </p> <p>CentralNic's own site claims it is 'fulfilling pent up demand' and helping com panies 'seeking a European identity' during a 'shortage of domain names [which] has concerned internet authorities'. </p> <p>Some people may agree that a .eu.com subdomain name helps achieve this. But don't buy one expecting to make millions. They are the fool's gold of the internet.</p>"
