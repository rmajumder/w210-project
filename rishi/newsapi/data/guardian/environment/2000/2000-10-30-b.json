  "It's dubbed the ministry of fun, and if you believe the papers, Tory culture spokesman Peter Ainsworth is a fun kind of guy. He smoked dope at college, so he can't be all bad. And shadowing Chris Smith in parliament is hardly a tough task - the culture secretary has not exactly covered himself in glory recently. It would be hard to cock it up. \"It is one of the best portfolios,\" admits Ainsworth with a smile. <p> It is not, however, easy to take a Tory culture spokesman seriously. In government, the Conservatives' broadcasting legacy was the discredited auction system that turned ITV into a free-for-all for the highest bidder. Successive national heritage secretaries were lambasted for being ineffectual (think Stephen Dorrell and Virginia Bottomley). And the Broadcasting Standards Commission, set up as a sop to the right-wing clean-up campaigners, has turned out to be a toothless tiger. Arts groups remember the Tories for slashing arts spending - even though it was the Conservative government that set up the national lottery. The one consolation is that the Tories at least enjoy plenty of friends in the press.</p> <p> So when Ainsworth was appointed to the brief after the last election, he had a hard task ahead of him. He could have just made a name for himself by providing handy quotes to the Daily Mail when it gets outraged about Channel 5 (and he has done his fair share of that), and wait until something better comes along.</p> <p> But, instead, Ainsworth has quietly been doing the rounds of the media circles. He is known to all the major broadcasters and lunches newspaper editors. He has immersed himself in all the issues that concern his wide brief (today the \"historic environment\" is at the front of his mind, following a meeting with English Heritage), and by all accounts, he has taken on board what people have said. Yet until the Mail on Sunday outed a crop of Tory frontbenchers as having tried cannabis in their youth, there was nothing much more to say about him.</p> <p> But with a white paper imminent, it is important for the Tories to be seen to have a thought-out communications policy. It's not enough just to moan about the BBC, you've got to have a view about what to do about it.</p> <p> And at least he watches TV and reads the papers. (There's a photocopy of the Sun's mocking front page the day after Greg Dyke was appointed to the BBC on his wall.) He enthuses about My Family, the BBC sitcom that has debuted to mixed reviews (\"very high-quality comedy\"), Who Wants To Be a Millionaire? (\"great theatre\"), and, of course: \"I became addicted to Big Brother. And yes, I voted.\" So did he go for Scouse builder Craig, or lesbian former nun Anna? \"I was one of the 49%.\" An Anna man, then.</p> <p> So that takes care of BBC, ITV and Channel 4. What about Channel 5, which he condemned as \"gross\" in the Mail earlier this year after it exposed Keith Chegwin's bodily parts to an undeserving public? He makes the right noises about protecting children, but adds: \"Well, you can switch it off. You don't have to watch it.\"</p> <p> Suddenly, he swaps his smooth Oxford-educated received pronunciation for a mock-south London accent to imitate a constituent who complained about the channel. \"He said to me, 'It's absolute filth innit, it goes on all night.' I replied, 'You don't have to watch it, there is the off button. And he said, 'Funnily enough, that's what my wife says.'\" Clearly Ainsworth isn't that concerned about Channel Filth.</p> <p> He is far more exercised with the BBC. It's not surprising: for the Conservatives, the corporation has always been a handy whipping boy. Full of pinko liberal subversives, it was a corrosive source of counter-revolutionary thought that had to be stamped on at all costs. The arrival of Dyke as director-general appeared to confirm that view. William Hague demanded that his appointment be blocked, and cries of \"Labour stooge\" went up as soon as he was confirmed in the post. Now, however, Dyke presents something of a problem for politicians of the right. In moving the Nine o'Clock News to 10pm with such haste, he has incurred the wrath of Smith. In slashing management costs, he has shown himself to be a shrewd businessman. And in showing a determination to increase the BBC's revenue from external sources, he has displayed a commercial eye that was lacking in the previous regime.</p> <p> Hence, a marked change in tune from the Tories. \"Greg is a highly commercial individual,\" says Ainsworth. \"To his core he is a commercial operator. That has merits. It's a breath of fresh air, a management style that's welcomed. He's an engaging guy, all that is good. What gives some cause for concern is that there is a degree of impetuousness which we saw with the sudden decision to bring forward the move of the news. That was a highly commercial thing to do.\"</p> <p> But Ainsworth doubts whether the commercialism of Dyke is necessarily a good thing for the corporation. \"Is there going to be a culture clash between the BBC as an institution and a man who is so entrepreneurial?\"</p> <p> So far, so reasonable. Many in the BBC would say the same thing. But lest we be in any doubt, Ainsworth calls back later after thinking about what he has said. Dyke is still very much on probation as far as his political bias is concerned. \"We are watching him like hawks. It's not an issue that can simply be brushed aside. I wouldn't want to give the impression that I think everything is rosy in the garden.\"</p> <p> During his interview, in his cramped offices at Millbank, he expresses serious concerns about the ratings-driven strategy that appears to have been adopted by Dyke, Mark Thompson and Lorraine Heggessey at the BBC. While he acknowledges that BBC1 must continue to be popular if the argument for the licence fee (which he supports) is to be sustained, he believes that the corporation has over-stepped the mark. Moving the news was \"opportunistic\". And it calls into question the role of the BBC governors, and the whole way in which the BBC - and the rest of the broadcasting industry - is regulated.</p> <p> While he says that \"any new parliamentary measures should be as profoundly deregulatory as humanly possible\", he agrees with the commercial sector's argument that the corporation should be brought under an overarching broadcasting regulator. The BBC governors cannot be \"judge and jury\" any more. But he does not advocate their abolition: \"There is plenty for them to do.\" Instead, they would play the role of \"non-executive directors\".</p> <p> It is unfair, he says, that ITV should have had to jump through so many hoops when it wanted to move News at Ten, when the BBC could do it in a matter of weeks without reference to an independent body. And it is equally unfair that those who wish to complain about the BBC's actions are also referred to the governors, who are ultimately responsible for the decisions in the first place.</p> <p> But he is a supporter of the licence fee \"for the time being\", and would not countenance allowing advertising onto the BBC. \"It would be devastating for the commercial sector.\"</p> <p> And even in the light of the News of the World's dispatch of the Broadcasting Standards Commission's hapless Lord Holme, he does not favour a privacy law. The PCC works well, he says, and is about the only sector where backdoor deals appear to be worthwhile - most complainants are satisfied with a personal letter of apology from an editor, or a phone call of explanation.</p> <p> As the Dome scandal dies down - Ainsworth has been particularly active in keeping Smith on the ropes over this one - he is now preparing for another political rollercoaster over the broadcasting white paper. These are not dull times.</p> <p> \"It's a wonderful brief, full of interesting issues and worthwhile people creating all sorts of things that are worthwhile in their own right - and are contributing increasingly to the economy. And everybody's got an opinion. It's intrinsically interesting - the whole sector, from sport to the 'historic environment' to broadcasting. And it will all assume a greater importance in our lives as we live longer and spend less of our time at work. Any political philosophy that ignores this, does so at its peril.\" </p>",
  "<p>The worst storms in 13 years have lashed southern Britain, leaving a trail of death, carnage and transport chaos. </p> <p>At least three people have been killed, and hundreds injured as the storms flooded homes, towns and roads.</p> <p>The 450ft high Millennium Wheel was closed after being damaged by the storms. Trips on the London Eye were suspended after six of the 32 capsules suffered glass damage as horrific winds lashed at them across the Thames. </p> <p>Gusts approaching 100mph upended trees and tens of thousands of homes have been left without power in the worst weather since the great hurricane in 1987.</p> <p>A man in his 50s was killed and two people, thought to be a married couple, were seriously injured when a tree fell on two vehicles on the A3, near Hindhead, Surrey, yesterday evening.</p> <p>Another man died last night when his car hit surface water and skidded into a parked car and then a bus in Sutton, south London.</p> <p>A tube train driver on the London Underground was badly injured when his train hit a tree on the Piccadilly Line. </p> <p>And another man was reportedly killed when his motorbike was believed to have a hit a tree on the A387 at Wrantage, near Taunton, Somerset.</p> <p>This morning, a tornado swept through Selsey in West Sussex, tossing caravans into the air, leaving two people injured from flying glass and a trail of wreckage. The tornado hit West Sands Caravan Park less than 48 hours after a similar incident in nearby Bognor Regis.</p> <p>At sea, the 33-year-old captain of a Dutch ship was killed last night as he was swept off balance and thrown down 30ft into the hold of his ship, anchored off Torbay. </p> <p>Sailings were cancelled from Dover and ferries were unable to dock, leavinf 6,000 passengers on vessels forced to shelter from force eight gales.</p> <p>The port of Fowey, near St Austell, was cut off by fallen trees blocking the roads, and a 20,000-tonne vessel ran aground in rough seas and force nine gales off Cornwall overnight. </p> <p>Train services into London were reduced to a trickle as weary commuters, already battered by recent rail delays, suffered again. </p> <p>Among the casualties were all services operated by Thames Trains, Wales &amp; West, First Great Western, Central Trains, South West Trains, Midland Mainline, Valley Lines and Connex. </p> <p>Additionally, all Virgin west coast services were suspended between Euston and Birmingham, Liverpool, Manchester, Glasgow and Carlisle. </p> <p>On the roads, large sections of the M25 around London were closed as drainage channels failed to cope with the sheer volume of water, while other main arteries were reduced to a crawl. </p> <p>The high winds brought chaos to air schedules with dozens of flights cancelled. By mid morning, British Airways had cancelled 66 flights from Heathrow and 22 from Stansted. </p> <p>More than 21,000 homes were left without electricity in the south east, according to power firm Seeboard. Power cuts also spread as far north as Cheshire. </p> <p>The west country was one of the worst affected regions. Avon and Somerset Police closed all roads into flood-hit Taunton to everything but emergency traffic.</p> <p>The Environment Agency said its staff were coping but warned that householders had to take more responsibility as climate change threatened to make such storms more likely. </p> <p>The number of severe flood warnings across the country, currently 25, could rise later this afternoon, he said. Up to 80mm of rain fell in 24 hours. </p> <p>Green lobby groups were today urging politicians to act now over wild weather conditions. The gales and storms battering Britain \"are just a taste of things to come\" according to Friends of the Earth. </p> <p>The deputy prime minister, John Prescott, and the environment minister, Michael Meacher, are preparing for major international climate change talks in the Hague next month. </p> <p>However, Mr Meacher, said: \"It would be wrong, every time there is a climatic impact, to assume that it is climate change, global warming.\"</p> <p>He did, however, acknowledge that the gales \"almost certainly have climate change as a contributory cause\". </p> <p>He said: \"We have to deal with that and the UK has to make a contribution, along with other countries ... but a lot of these climatic impacts are irreversible. We have to adapt to them. We have to give warning alerts which the Environment Agency is successfully doing.\"</p> <p>Mr Meacher said that much was being done to prevent people being continually flooded, especially in high-risk areas. </p> <p>The Ministry of Agriculture had now put \u00a34bn into capital improvement works to strengthen flood defences over the next three years, he said. </p> <p>Friends of the Earth said that extreme weather worldwide in the last three months has included storms in Taiwan, Brazil and Canada, floods in Bangladesh, Japan, Vietnam and India, fires in the US, Italy and the Balkans, and droughts in Burundi, Croatia, Kenya and Iran. </p> <p><strong>Useful links</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/weather/Map2/0,5543,390091,00.html\">Map: worst hit areas</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/gallery/galleryguide/0,6143,390064,00.html\">Photo gallery: storm-hit Britain</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/netnotes/article/0,6729,390073,00.html\">NetNotes: the best weather links</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/weather\">Special report: weather watch</a></p>",
  "<p>The Department of Trade and Industry is to launch an investigation into allegations that tobacco giant British American Tobacco is implicated in smuggling, it said today.</p> <p>Secretary of State Stephen Byers said that he had appointed investigators to look into the allegations in response to a Health Select Committee report on the tobacco industry.</p> <p>He said: \"I have given careful consideration to the unanimous recommendation of the select committee that the DTI should investigate the allegations of BAT's involvement in smuggling.</p> <p>\"I have decided to appoint investigators to look into this and to report back to me as soon as possible.</p> <p>\"I will then decide what further steps I must take and whether the facts support a reference to other authorities.\"</p> <p>BAT said in a statement that it was \"naturally disappointed\" at the move by Mr Byers.</p> <p>\"We will, of course, cooperate fully with the investigators, but will be making no further comments during the course of their work,\" it said.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for Conservative former chancellor Kenneth Clarke said that Mr Clarke, as deputy chairman for BAT, had no comment to make.</p> <p>\"Mr Clarke is not making a statement. The company has done so,\" she said.</p> <p>In February, Mr Clarke sought to rebut accusations that BAT was involved in large-scale cigarette smuggling and that it indirectly encouraged drug runners' money laundering operations.</p> <p>The accusations stemmed from research conducted by the charity Action on Smoking and Health (Ash) and investigative journalist Duncan Campbell.</p> <p>The allegations have also been aired by Channel 4 News. It was claimed that BAT's own internal documentation demonstrated that the company was involved in orchestrating, managing and controlling cigarette smuggling in Asia and Latin America in the early 1990s, with BAT exercising control over illegal distribution channels through intermediaries.</p> <p>But Mr Clarke, a former health secretary as well as chancellor, told the House of Commons select committee on health that the accusations were unfounded.</p> <p>Mr Clarke acknowledged that cigarettes were smuggled into markets such as Colombia, but insisted that BAT was not involved in that process.</p> <p>\"There is no evidence I have ever seen that BAT is a participant in this smuggling. We seek to minimise it and avoid it,\" Mr Clarke told the committee.</p> <p>Mr Clarke insisted that BAT was \"a company of integrity and a good corporate citizen\", which observed not only the requirements of the law in the countries in which it operated, but also \"good ethical standards\".</p> <p>BAT chairman Martin Broughton also denied, before the committee's February hearing, any wrongdoing on his company's part.</p> <p>Asked if he refuted the accusations that the company was involved in managing cigarette smuggling and money laundering, he insisted: \"I refute those (accusations) completely.\"</p> <p>In what was often a heated session, at one point Mr Broughton demonstrated his feelings about Mr Campbell's research by tearing up one document that the journalist presented as part of his efforts to substantiate his claims.</p> <p>In his evidence to the committee, Mr Campbell explained that South American-based drug runners raise huge sums by smuggling narcotics such as cocaine and heroin into the United States, then \"launder\" the dollars generated by using them to buy cigarettes, which are smuggled back into their own countries.</p> <p>Mr Campbell claimed that BAT \"assiduously\" and \"deliberately\" supported the cigarette smuggling market.</p> <p>In June, in a report it published on the impact of smoking, the committee called for an inquiry into the allegations.</p> <p>Director of Ash Clive Bates said: \"We think the evidence that BAT has been controlling and facilitating tobacco smuggling is overwhelming.</p> <p>\"We are just delighted that the DTI is going to hold them to account. I think this will be a turning point in the fight against tobacco smuggling, because the authorities will have the evidence that the tobacco industry itself is a major player in global smuggling.</p> <p>\"The tobacco industry will no longer be seen as friends but somebody working hand-in-glove with organised crime.</p> <p>\"While not doing the smuggling themselves, they are doing everything necessary to make sure smuggling happens in their commercial interests and on a very large scale,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>Ten years ago, climate change was a worry far away on the horizon, more of concern to grandchildren, a problem that, as responsible citizens, we should tackle soon.</p> <p>This week, as the south east of England was battered by the latest in a series of storms the threat seemed much more immediate - once in 30 years floods had come twice in a month to places in Kent and Sussex.</p> <p>While all the international political focus has been on reducing carbon dioxide emissions to avert future global warming, an equally important second area of work has been progressing on local adaptation to its effects, which are soon to be.</p> <p>In the UK there have been, so far largely unheeded warnings about not building on flood plains, plus unreported changes to building regulations so that tall buildings can withstand higher wind speeds.</p> <p>The response to the danger of ever increasing sea levels has been to add another few feet to the height of sea walls around property on the coast and abandon some poorer quality agricultural land to the sea as no longer worth the expense of protecting.</p> <p>It is the small beginning of a new era in a Britain and the rest of Europe that is used to a benign climate.</p> <p>Extremes were always regarded as rare and generally happened somewhere else - the United States being a prime example.</p> <p>Scientists are still reluctant to say that what is happening to the British climate can be blamed on global warming.</p> <p>While they say that this is the sort of weather we could expect as a result of global warming, they say that current events have not been going on long enough to be sure.</p> <p>But the evidence of climate change is building all the time.</p> <p>On average, British birds nest two weeks earlier than 30 years ago. Insect species - including bees and termites - that need warmer weather to survive are moving north.</p> <p>Some have already crossed the Channel from France. It is now warm enough for malaria mosquitoes to survive and breed in Sussex.</p> <p>Glaciers in Europe are in retreat, particular in the Alps and Iceland. Icecaps throughout the world are getting smaller - even the North Pole was ice free for part of this summer.</p> <p>Extremes of weather are driven by heat, together with the contrast between the hot tropics and the cold poles.</p> <p>The warmer the sea the more intense the storms - and the average wave height in the Atlantic has increased - making the damage that a rise in sea level can do to the coast even greater.</p> <p>If this is not climate change then it is a pretty good example of what to expect from now on. It seems the British fascination with the weather is set to continue.</p>",

  "<p>Two Russians and an American will blast off from Baikonur in Kazakhstan tomorrow to set up camp at the most demanding construction site ever known. They will be the first permanent residents of the International Space Station - a $30bn complex of hotel, power station and laboratories the size of a football field, orbiting the earth every 90 minutes at an altitude of 220 miles. </p> <p>The completion of this tall order will take more than 40 trips by spacecraft, and more than 160 \"spacewalks\" by the construction workers. </p> <p>Seven flights of the space shuttle and Proton rocket have already delivered the first bolt-together modules and temporary living accommodation. Now three experienced space hands are about to begin the laborious and dangerous job of taking delivery of, and assembling, the rest. </p> <p>Sixteen nations - but not Britain - are involved in the space station, the culmination of a dream as old as the space age itself. </p> <p><strong> Zero gravity </strong><br> </p> <p>During the heady days of Apollo, space scientists and engineers drew up plans for vast orbiting colonies that could be home to up to 10,000 people, growing their own food and refining valuable minerals from asteroids and comets for export back to earth, or human settlements on the moon. </p> <p>The ISS has been scaled down again and again in the past two decades, and will be home to only seven men and women, staying for up to six months at a time, when it is finally completed in 2005. </p> <p>To make that happen Bill Shepherd, 51, Yuri Gidzenko, 38, and Sergei Krikalev, 42, have to begin handling tools and moving building materials in the most hostile environment of all. </p> <p>They will have to work in zero gravity, where Newton's laws of motion create special problems for people not used to weightlessness. In space, when an astronaut turns a spanner, the bolt is likely to stay still while he turns. </p> <p>There are other difficulties. A spacecraft operates at the same atmospheric pressure as earth, and its crew breathe normal air. Once in spacesuits, the astronauts operate at a much lower pressure and breathe oxygen, so the new team will have to spend time \"washing out\" the nitrogen in their bodies to avoid the \"bends\" before they can begin work. </p> <p>Once out of the spacecraft there are other problems. When an astronaut works on the sunny side, the temperature can be well above boiling point. When he works in the shade, it can fall to well below minus 100C. So he has to have a space suit that contains heating and cooling equipment, a helmet that won't mist from his own breath, an air supply - and even tiny heaters in his gloves. </p> <p>He has to work with specially designed tools: no-one dare risk handing an astronaut a screwdriver or chisel with a sharp edge that might tear a hole in a spacesuit. </p> <p>The great terror is of becoming detached from the spaceship, and not being able to get back. So each man will wear a tiny jetpack to puff him gently back to safety if he gets too far away. </p> <p>They will be assisted by a robot crane, and astronauts will be able to call on a spare pair of eyes in a little free-flying television camera embedded in a sphere a little bigger than a football, controlled by the crew in the space station. </p> <p>The help may be sophisticated - but over the next five years successive teams of men and women workers face shifts of six hours at a time, doing the loneliest job in the world. </p> <p><strong> Night and day</strong><br> </p> <p>They will have to cope with weariness - and even fear of falling. They will experience night and day every 90 minutes. They will see the world turning up to 250 miles below them. And they will not dare relax, even for a second. </p> <p>\"It is very hard to work against the spacesuit, particularly because of fatigue of the fingers and hands. In order to manipulate any kinds of objects you have to put a lot of force on your hands,\" says William Paloski, one of Nasa's medical experts. </p> <p>\"Some crew members in the past have had trouble with being outside the payload bay. There are some perceptual illusions that sometimes occur - people get a sensation of falling that is very difficult to overcome.\"</p> <p><strong>Who's on board and what they'll be doing</strong></p> <p><strong>William Shepherd</strong> Commander of Expedition-1, which moves into the International Space Station this week, is also a captain in the US navy, a frogman, an underwater demolition expert and a former Seal, a member of the navy's crack combat group. He has spent 440 hours in space.</p> <p><strong> Lt Col Yuri Gidzenko</strong> Second in command and commander of the Soyuz rocket which takes the trio to the space station and then serves as a lifeboat for the return journey. Gidzenko has served six months as commander of a mission to Mir, the Russian space station. </p> <p><strong> Sergei Krikalev</strong> The best known and by far the most experienced of the trio is the flight engineer. He was the cosmonaut who went up to Mir in 1991 as an officer of the Soviet Union, played host to the British astronaut Helen Sharman and came back to Earth in 1992 as a Russian citizen after the dramatic collapse of the USSR. </p> <p>He was an aerobatics champion for the USSR and Russia. He holds one title of Hero of the Soviet Union and one as Hero of Russia, and has the Order of Lenin and the French L\u00e9gion d'Honneur. </p> <p><strong> Microgravity</strong> </p> <p>The astronauts will look at microgravity. Nasa argues that if scientists can study how crystals form, without distortion from gravity, they might find out how to make more effective drugs, create more powerful computer chips, or confect stronger, lighter alloys. </p> <p><strong> Radiation</strong> </p> <p>They will be able to study the long-term effects of radiation on living tissue. One early set of visitors to the space station will be billions of bacteria collected by the British Antarctic Survey from the hostile dry valleys of Antarctica. How they fare in space might help biologists to answer basic questions about life itself. </p> <p><strong> Human physiology</strong> </p> <p>Medical scientists want to know more about human physiology under unusual conditions.

  "Britain's trend towards government by focus group and consumer survey does not work because the public is too bored, wily or dim, academics claimed yesterday. <p>Thousands of well-meant questionnaires on policy or spending priorities come up with duff or misleading information, according to statisticians, because of \"hopelessly poor\" methods of picking ordinary people's brains. </p> <p>\"We all know the saying about 'lies, damned lies and statistics',\" said Keith Meadows of Hull University, where polling analysts from across the democratic world gather to debate the issue next month. </p> <p>\"But we now need to get to grips with the 'sorry, I didn't understand the question' phenomenon, or the many and various ways people have of getting rid of a survey pollster as quickly as they can.\" </p> <p>The conference on what really happens when authority consults the man in the street has been prompted by the belief that \"there may be a chasm between what people think they are being asked in surveys by official bodies, and what they are really being asked\". </p> <p>Many issues, said Dr Meadows, make far more taxing intellectual demands on respondents than their organisers realise, and the answers can easily stray towards the meaningless or trite. </p> <p>\"People have a natural tendency to give well-meant generalisations which those who actually have to make a decision cannot do,\" he said. \"Or they could be deceiving themselves, as can happen in health checks when a GP asks how many glasses of wine or beer you drink per week.\" </p> <p>The gathering coincides with a forthcoming circular to local councils and other decision-making authorities from the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, emphasising the need for best practice in consultation. </p> <p>Schemes such as a pilot in Lincolnshire, where council tax rebates are being offered as an incentive to fill in council service questionnaires, have raised concern that polling methods should be more sophisticated than the \"do you like this sample of chocolate\" model. </p> <p>The conference, on Cognitive Aspects of Survey Methodology, will draw particularly on experience in the United States, where polling and focus groups have been part of the political and business marketing scene for longer than elsewhere. </p> <p>The conference findings are expected to help the framing of the next census, the biggest of all the government's dialogues with its citizens.</p>",
  "<p>The BBC Radio 4 Today programme team will be moving back to Broadcasting House along with the corporation's other network radio journalists, the corporation confirmed today.</p> <p>The BBC's network TV journalists, who have never been based in central London before, will also be making the move from Television Centre in west London to Broadcasting House. </p> <p>They will be joined by BBC World Service staff from Bush House in the Strand.</p> <p>But the move back to Broadcasting House will not begin for at least six years and is expected to take up to eight to complete. Before that the Portland Place site will be redeveloped to house the 4,000 or so BBC network TV, radio and World Service journalists.</p> <p>Architects MacCormac Jamieson Prichard have been appointed to design the new Broadcasting House complex, incorporating the existing BBC HQ building - which dates back to 1932 and is a Grade II listed building - and a new extension.</p> <p>Two adjacent BBC offices built in the 1960s, Egton House - former home of Radio 1 - and 16 Langham Street, will be knocked down and redeveloped.</p> <p>The announcement marks a U-turn for BBC bosses, who moved the Today staff and other radio journalists out of Broadcasting House just two years ago.</p> <p>The move was part of BBC director of news Tony Hall's drive to create a bi-media TV and radio news operation and was bitterly opposed at the time by high profile journalists such as John Humphrys.</p> <p>BBC network radio boss Liz Forgan also protested against the move and ultimately quit the corporation. She broke her silence about her resignation for the first time last week, branding the \u00a341m move to west London a waste of licence-payers' money.</p> <p>Ms Forgan's stance has now been vindicated with BBC bosses abandoning the bi-media offices as unworkable. Mr Hall also had to drop plans to move World Service staff to Stage Six, because of a lack of space.</p> <p>Today journalists have claimed their concerns about not being able to attract such high calibre political interviewees to come to west London have been borne out. Many politicians are now interviewed from remote studios in central London, which critics believe means they are able to get off more lightly than if they were in a face-to-face interview in the Today studio.</p> <p>Mr Hall said: \"It has long been an ambition to bring BBC News together with World Service journalists. The redevelopment of Broadcasting House will provide an opportunity to realise that ambition to produce a global force in broadcasting unmatched anywhere else in the world.\"</p> <p>The revamped Broadcasting House site will cover around 50,000 square foot of publicly accessible space, including a piazza with a bigger audience handling area for the BBC Radio Theatre.</p> <p>The redevelopment is to be funded through the joint venture the BBC is in the process of establishing with a commercial partner to manage its property portfolio. Two consortia, Foresite and Insight, were shortlisted for the joint venture earlier this month and the deal is expected to be completed by spring 2001.</p> <p>The BBC will have to negotiate a three year extension to its Bush House lease, which runs out in 2005, in ensure World Service staff can stay there until their new Broadcasting House accommodation is completed. TV Centre's Stage Six area will be inherited by BBC network TV production staff when BBC News moves out.</p>",
  "<p>Celtic had to battle hard for a point in a 3-3 draw in a compelling match against Motherwell yesterday that restores a three-point cushion at the top. Much more significant is the gap of 13 points which has now opened up between the two Glasgow rivals after Rangers' shock 3-0 defeat at home to Kilmarnock on Saturday. It was their third successive league defeat and leaves manager Dick Advocaat having to fight his way out of the worst corner he has known in 20 years as a coach.</p> <p>But Celtic will feel aggrieved not to have secured an outright victory here after referee Hugh Dallas failed to spot a Johan Mjallby 'goal' which TV replays proved had crossed the line midway through the second half. </p> <p>An ankle injury prevented Chris Sutton from taking part but even in his absence Celtic dominated the opening exchanges. The Motherwell goalkeeper Stephen Woods exhibited his vulnerability by failing to collect a 14th-minute corner which Larsson immediately headed back into a crowded area where Johan Mjallby was waiting to blast in from unmissable range. </p> <p>Motherwell showed their mettle by forcing an equaliser within 10 minutes. Joos Valgaeren half cut out a through-ball, allowing John Spencer to put in a cross that Tom Boyd could only help up into the air and, when it came down, Derek Adams beat Valgaeren and headed into the net. </p> <p>Eight minutes after half-time, Motherwell took the lead for the only time in the game. Brannan was the architect with a superb pass that sent Stuart Elliott heading menacingly for goal and, although he ended up with only a corner, it was enough to supply Lee McCulloch for a headed finish. </p> <p>But that lead lasted just four minutes as Motherwell themselves failed to deal with a set-piece, a corner delivered by Thompson. Larsson nodded it down and Valgaeren smashed it in from close range. </p> <p>Then came the frustration of Mjallby's disallowed goal, with replays showing it should have been allowed. As if aggrieved, Celtic took the lead in the 72nd minute through Jackie McNamara, who rolled the ball past Woods after Larsson set him up. </p> <p>Yet Motherwell were not to be denied and Mjallby pushed the substitute Don Goodman over and Brannan made no mistake from the spot to win a precious point for his side. </p> <p>Dick Advocaat must have looked on enviously at the endeavour and spirit shown by Celtic. His side can boast only one win, one draw and five defeats in the past seven matches. Rangers have not slumped like this in the Scottish Premier League in seven years and not for a further 10 had they lost three league games in a row. Rubbing salt into Ibrox wounds has come a further unexpected twist - a sudden turnaround of fortunes in the Champions League which had started so brightly but which now threatens to collapse against Monaco a week tomorrow. </p> <p>In addition his Rangers squad is currently being crippled by injury. Advocaat, in paying his respects to Kilmarnock, exhibited a warming grace after this match, but no Rangers manager could withstand the temporary loss of Stefan Klos, Michael Mols, Giovanni van Bronckhorst, Jorg Albertz, Barry Ferguson and Claudio Reyna among six others. The heart of Advocaat's team has been gouged out. </p> <p>Rumours persist that there is disharmony in the Rangers dressing room - at least according to one former alumnus, Ally McCoist. Advocaat also has a liability in his captain Lorenzo Amoruso, who on Saturday, not for the first time, indulged in a row with a team-mate on the pitch - this time Arthur Numan.</p> <p>\"It was another poor performance from us,\" said Advocaat. \"We are lacking confidence right now, not just as a team, but individually as well. The players' confidence is low and it is my job to rebuild that. We need to get results. I don't like to make an excuse - but the truth is no manager could go without 10 injured first-team players as we are doing at the moment. If people are to judge me, let them do so when my team is playing, not when so many players are out.\"</p>",

  "<p>It's dubbed the ministry of fun, and if you believe the papers, Tory culture spokesman Peter Ainsworth is a fun kind of guy. He smoked dope at college, so he can't be all bad. And shadowing Chris Smith in parliament is hardly a tough task - the culture secretary has not exactly covered himself in glory recently. It would be hard to cock it up. \"It is one of the best portfolios,\" admits Ainsworth with a smile. </p> <p>It is not, however, easy to take a Tory culture spokesman seriously. In government, the Conservatives' broadcasting legacy was the discredited auction system that turned ITV into a free-for-all for the highest bidder. Successive national heritage secretaries were lambasted for being ineffectual (think Stephen Dorrell and Virginia Bottomley). And the Broadcasting Standards Commission, set up as a sop to the right-wing clean-up campaigners, has turned out to be a toothless tiger. Arts groups remember the Tories for slashing arts spending - even though it was the Conservative government that set up the national lottery. The one consolation is that the Tories at least enjoy plenty of friends in the press. </p> <p>So when Ainsworth was appointed to the brief after the last election, he had a hard task ahead of him. He could have just made a name for himself by providing handy quotes to the Daily Mail when it gets outraged about Channel 5 (and he has done his fair share of that), and wait until something better comes along. </p> <p>But, instead, Ainsworth has quietly been doing the rounds of the media circles. He is known to all the major broadcasters and lunches newspaper editors. He has immersed himself in all the issues that concern his wide brief (today the \"historic environment\" is at the front of his mind, following a meeting with English Heritage), and by all accounts, he has taken on board what people have said. Yet until the Mail on Sunday outed a crop of Tory frontbenchers as having tried cannabis in their youth, there was nothing much more to say about him. </p> <p>But with a white paper imminent, it is important for the Tories to be seen to have a thought-out communications policy. It's not enough just to moan about the BBC, you've got to have a view about what to do about it. </p> <p>And at least he watches TV and reads the papers. (There's a photocopy of the Sun's mocking front page the day after Greg Dyke was appointed to the BBC on his wall.) He enthuses about My Family, the BBC sitcom that has debuted to mixed reviews (\"very high-quality comedy\"), Who Wants To Be a Millionaire? (\"great theatre\"), and, of course: \"I became addicted to Big Brother. And yes, I voted.\" So did he go for Scouse builder Craig, or lesbian former nun Anna? \"I was one of the 49%.\" An Anna man, then. </p> <p>So that takes care of BBC, ITV and Channel 4. What about Channel 5, which he condemned as \"gross\" in the Mail earlier this year after it exposed Keith Chegwin's bodily parts to an undeserving public? He makes the right noises about protecting children, but adds: \"Well, you can switch it off. You don't have to watch it.\" </p> <p>Suddenly, he swaps his smooth Oxford-educated received pronunciation for a mock-south London accent to imitate a constituent who complained about the channel. \"He said to me, 'It's absolute filth innit, it goes on all night.' I replied, 'You don't have to watch it, there is the off button. And he said, 'Funnily enough, that's what my wife says.'\" Clearly Ainsworth isn't that concerned about Channel Filth. </p> <p>He is far more exercised with the BBC. It's not surprising: for the Conservatives, the corporation has always been a handy whipping boy. Full of pinko liberal subversives, it was a corrosive source of counter-revolutionary thought that had to be stamped on at all costs. The arrival of Dyke as director-general appeared to confirm that view. William Hague demanded that his appointment be blocked, and cries of \"Labour stooge\" went up as soon as he was confirmed in the post. Now, however, Dyke presents something of a problem for politicians of the right. In moving the Nine o'Clock News to 10pm with such haste, he has incurred the wrath of Smith. In slashing management costs, he has shown himself to be a shrewd businessman. And in showing a determination to increase the BBC's revenue from external sources, he has displayed a commercial eye that was lacking in the previous regime. </p> <p>Hence, a marked change in tune from the Tories. \"Greg is a highly commercial individual,\" says Ainsworth. \"To his core he is a commercial operator. That has merits. It's a breath of fresh air, a management style that's welcomed. He's an engaging guy, all that is good. What gives some cause for concern is that there is a degree of impetuousness which we saw with the sudden decision to bring forward the move of the news. That was a highly commercial thing to do.\" </p> <p>But Ainsworth doubts whether the commercialism of Dyke is necessarily a good thing for the corporation. \"Is there going to be a culture clash between the BBC as an institution and a man who is so entrepreneurial?\" </p> <p>So far, so reasonable. Many in the BBC would say the same thing. But lest we be in any doubt, Ainsworth calls back later after thinking about what he has said. Dyke is still very much on probation as far as his political bias is concerned. \"We are watching him like hawks. It's not an issue that can simply be brushed aside. I wouldn't want to give the impression that I think everything is rosy in the garden.\" </p> <p>During his interview, in his cramped offices at Millbank, he expresses serious concerns about the ratings-driven strategy that appears to have been adopted by Dyke, Mark Thompson and Lorraine Heggessey at the BBC. While he acknowledges that BBC1 must continue to be popular if the argument for the licence fee (which he supports) is to be sustained, he believes that the corporation has over-stepped the mark. Moving the news was \"opportunistic\". And it calls into question the role of the BBC governors, and the whole way in which the BBC - and the rest of the broadcasting industry - is regulated. </p> <p>While he says that \"any new parliamentary measures should be as profoundly deregulatory as humanly possible\", he agrees with the commercial sector's argument that the corporation should be brought under an overarching broadcasting regulator. The BBC governors cannot be \"judge and jury\" any more. But he does not advocate their abolition: \"There is plenty for them to do.\" Instead, they would play the role of \"non-executive directors\". </p> <p>It is unfair, he says, that ITV should have had to jump through so many hoops when it wanted to move News at Ten, when the BBC could do it in a matter of weeks without reference to an independent body. And it is equally unfair that those who wish to complain about the BBC's actions are also referred to the governors, who are ultimately responsible for the decisions in the first place. </p> <p>But he is a supporter of the licence fee \"for the time being\", and would not countenance allowing advertising onto the BBC. \"It would be devastating for the commercial sector.\" </p> <p>And even in the light of the News of the World's dispatch of the Broadcasting Standards Commission's hapless Lord Holme, he does not favour a privacy law. The PCC works well, he says, and is about the only sector where backdoor deals appear to be worthwhile - most complainants are satisfied with a personal letter of apology from an editor, or a phone call of explanation. </p> <p>As the Dome scandal dies down - Ainsworth has been particularly active in keeping Smith on the ropes over this one - he is now preparing for another political rollercoaster over the broadcasting white paper. These are not dull times. </p> <p>\"It's a wonderful brief, full of interesting issues and worthwhile people creating all sorts of things that are worthwhile in their own right - and are contributing increasingly to the economy. And everybody's got an opinion. It's intrinsically interesting - the whole sector, from sport to the 'historic environment' to broadcasting. And it will all assume a greater importance in our lives as we live longer and spend less of our time at work. Any political philosophy that ignores this, does so at its peril.\"</p>",
  "<p>If you read any papers besides the Guardian, the Times and the FT you will no doubt have recently spotted one of several full-page colour ads for MegaStar, the Daily Star's website. Carried in titles including the Telegraph, the Independent and the London Evening Standard, the ads have featured a variety of topless women covering up their ample curves with large placards. These have carried a range of straight news headlines such as \"Aptitude tests aid entry to elite academic institutions\" and \"Polo aims to be populist not elitist sport, says lord\". </p> <p>This somewhat unlikely juxtaposition of nudity with rather posh news has been aimed at highlighting the fact that MegaStar offers online users \"visionary and definitive sports analysis\" and even \"in-depth news and current affairs\" as well as, erm, the rather more colourful, titillating fare of scantily-clad women. </p> <p>Not surprisingly, several broadsheets have refused to carry them, some no doubt worrying about eyebrows being raised in Milton Keynes and bulging postbags. </p> <p>But this is not unusual - newspapers and magazines often reject one-off ads and even whole campaigns. While TV stations cannot make independent decisions on what commercials to allow (all TV ads are pre-vetted by the Broadcast Advertising Clearance Centre), individual print media organisations have the power to decide which advertisements they want to carry - and which not. </p> <p>Gary Ward, head of communications at the Advertising Standards Authority, the print advertising watchdog which monitors complaints about ads after they have been published, explains: \"There is no equivalent of the BACC in print. There is no pre-vetting system - that would be impossible because there are over 30m print ads a year. The decision is therefore left to the discretion of the individual publishers and media owners.\" </p> <p>Aside from making sure ads are not misleading or unlawful, as laid out in the British Code of Advertising, the press mostly vet copy supplied by advertisers because they want to \"protect\" their readers and safeguard their product's reputation. This manifests itself in general issues of taste and decency - the most common reasons for ads being rejected. Kevin Brown, a partner at MegaStar's ad agency Soul, says: \"We wanted to run the ads in quality newspapers because our target audience is ABC1 men - and they read the broadsheets. We were simply using the media environment and our creative message to stand out and grab attention. The ads are not tasteless but fun, pretty harmless and very striking in that environment. It seems over the top to me that those papers refused to carry them.\" </p> <p>The Guardian maintains it rejected them \"because editorially we did not agree with the way they represented the site\". Brown says other reasons given were variations on the theme of \"they would upset our readers\" or \"the ads are too over the top for our publication\": in short, it was the naked flesh that was judged unacceptable, with one title even suggesting that if the women were put in sarongs and T-shirts they would reconsider. </p> <p>While nudity might be offensive to some papers, however, swearing can cause ructions elsewhere. A Saatchi &amp; Saatchi ad for the NSPCC in 1995 carried a picture of a clenched fist with the word \"love\" tattooed on it. The copy below read: \"The only love I ever got from my father. Bastard.\" Despite the power of this idea, the Sun refused to run the advert, loftily stating at the time: \"We are a family paper and we don't allow swearing.\" </p> <p>Cosmopolitan has also been known to take a stance against ads it perceives to be sexist. There was a Wonderbra advertisement last year featuring a girl in a Santa outfit beside the saucy line: \"The tree won't be the only thing that lights up this Xmas\". Cosmo rejected it, apparently, for belittling women. </p> <p>Chatlines or overtly sexy advertisements are also frequently outlawed. But it is most often charity ads which fall foul of the press's sense of taste and decency, largely because they depend on shocking imagery to pack their punch. </p> <p>Earlier this year, a very hard- hitting advertisement by Bartle Bogle Hegarty for Barnado's was rejected by the Daily Mail and the Mail on Sunday. It featured a baby sitting in a filthy room with a tourniquet round its arm, as if preparing to shoot up heroin. </p> <p>The Mail has also just thrown out the latest Barnado's advertisement which features a young boy lying lifeless beside a sawn-off shotgun outside a bank, having seemingly bungled a raid. John Teal, ad director on the newpaper, explains: \"We have carried other adverts in the campaign, but the one showing a baby jacking up and the other with a child and a shotgun were considered by the editorial department to be distasteful and unsuitable, and offensive to the readers. We have run editorial articles about the campaign but as far as these ads are concerned we decided not to carry them.\" </p> <p> Given that it is the editorial departments that tend to rule on advertisement acceptance (the ad departments being more driven to accept anyone's cash), some decisions are often simply down to the whim of an editor. He or she might want fox-hunting banned and therefore refuse to carry pro-hunting ads from the Countryside Alliance, while pro-euro or Europe advertising might be banned by, say, the Sun. </p> <p>Political ads might also be refused on the grounds that they don't fit in with editorial policy. A right-leaning paper could, for instance, refuse to carry ads for New Labour - or at least charge them a prohibitively expensive rate which effectively rules them out of appearing. </p> <p>Other moral stands are sometimes taken. The FT, for instance, unlike most other national newspapers, refuses to carry tobacco advertisements at all. </p> <p>But, perhaps most predictably, it is ads for competitive products that invariably fail to make it - if they even bother to try. Peter Barrie, display ad manager on the Telegraph, explains: \"Commercial issues could well make us refuse an ad, for instance if it was for a rival newspaper. We would probably charge ratecard, and so not do them any deal, but if it really was a direct rival like the Times we would probably turn them down altogether.\" </p> <p>The issue which most frustrates advertisers and their agencies when dealing with rejected ads is the lack of understanding and the apparent inconsistency of policy from one paper to the next - or indeed from the same publication. In the case of the MegaStar campaign, the aforementioned broadsheets refused it but it was warmly welcomed by such august journals as Legal Week, Golf International and even the Spectator. At the same time, the Daily Mail rejected the heroin baby but was happy to carry another Barnado's ad that featured a young girl standing like a soliciting prostitute on a street corner beside a parked car. </p> <p>Press editors simply take the view that it is their prerogative to accept or reject adverts, on whatever seemingly unreasonable or inconsistent grounds those might be. In general, however, they would rather be broad-minded enough to carry every ad that is booked into their publication - not least because of the financial implications of rejecting something. With a campaign of full-page colour press ads being worth as much as \u00a3500,000, they reject too much copy at their peril. </p> <p>Barrie concludes: \"We are extremely liberal, within the law. Why would we turn something down? It's money, and it's up to the readers. Some papers might claim an ad is in poor taste, but so is the Sun - and 4m people happily read that.\"</p>",
  "The two boys kicked the five-year-old girl repeatedly. They stripped her and stoned her and beat her till she was unconscious. Then they left Silje R\u00e6derg rd in the snow to freeze to death. The comparisons with the Bulger case were as eery as they were inevitable. It was only a year after Jon Venables and Robert Thompson had been found guilty of the murder of James Bulger. The British case had caused an outcry. The violent nature of the response was almost as shocking as the killing. Mobs descended on Preston crown court, threw stones at the two police vans containing the boys, and bayed for vengeance. In a way the killing in Norway was even more shocking. England had seen child murderers before. But in the quiet, frozen town of Trondheim they were unheard of. There was barely any crime. The police officers were gentle, educated folk - more like social workers - who spent their time strolling around in snow-capped boots, chatting to the locals. <p>Seven years on from the Bulger killings, the outcry hasn't died down. When Lord Woolf announced last week that Thompson and Venables were likely to be released next year and given new names and identities, many British newspapers responded with belligerent disbelief. \"Sick!\" screamed The Sun, \"Has justice betrayed the little boy who was never allowed to grow up?\" asked the Daily Mail. Denise Fergus, James Bulger's mother, said the children had got away with murder in every sense. Six years on from the killing of Silje, by contrast, there is silence in Norway. The most infamous event in the history of Trondheim has been discussed, contexualised, resolved. Society has moved on. </p> <p>Harry Tiller, a journalist at the local paper in Trondheim, hasn't returned to the story in years; there's been no need to. Yes, he says, it was terrible, the most shocking thing he has had the misfortune to cover, but the culprits were just six years old; how did they know what they were doing? In Norway, where the age of criminality is 15 - as opposed to 10 in Britain - they were treated as victims not killers. </p> <p>Beate R\u00e6derg rd says she rarely goes out these days. She stays at home with her budgie and her partner and her two surviving children. She suffers from post-traumatic stress which makes it impossible to work. The family often talk about what happened to Silje and, however hard it is to explain, especially to eight-year-old Martin, she tells them how her sister died: \"Just the other day we were talking about it, and Martin asked what happened. I said Silje was killed by friends because they were playing too hard.\" It's true. The killers were Silje's friends, they'd spent many days in Beate's front room playing with the children. On October 15, 1994, Silje was playing with the friends on a local football field. The game turned violent. When Silje faded out of consciousness the boys ran away in fear. </p> <p>I ask Beate whether she hates the boys, and she seems astonished by the question. No, she says, of course not, although she still cannot comprehend what happened. \"They were Silje's friends ...\" she says, tailing off. Should they have been punished, locked up? \"No, they were punished enough by what they did. They have to live with that. I think everybody has got to be treated like a human being. The children had to be educated, had to learn how to treat other people so they could get back into society.\" </p> <p>Her quiet, humane response is shocking. I tell her I can't believe that she managed to forgive the boys. \"I have forgiven the boys for a long time. The hardest thing is to forgive myself.\" But you have nothing to blame yourself for?\" I know ... but I feel I haven't done everything in the right order after Silje's death. Small things. I think I should have included my family more in my grief.\" Beate talks about her 15-year-old daughter, Lyne, and the special bond she and Silje had. \"She feels a very important piece is missing in her life. She's coping with school but, you know, not getting the top marks.\" </p> <p>Trondheim, with its population of 135,000, was proud of its crime rate - there had been just two murders in six years at the time of Silje's death. The police not only knew legally that the boys were too young to be criminals; they felt morally they weren't criminals. They were victims of their own violence. </p> <p>Rolv Sverre Fostervold was the leader of the local child administration at the time: \"It was a Saturday and the winter was coming to Trondheim, the first snows. Then this awful thing happened.\" He and the police had to find a means of telling the community. \"Nothing like this had happened before, so on the Sunday we decided to open the schools to give information to the public. We appealed to the people not to start any violence, and guaranteed that no one else was at risk, that children were safe. It was very important to tell the people before the media.\" </p> <p>The killing of Silje had a profound effect on the close community. Local people felt collective shame, grief, and responsibility. The grief was not just for Silje and her family but for the boys and their families. How could such a tragedy happen? </p> <p>The boys were never named, but most people knew who they were. Their names have never appeared in the media, which shared the feeling of shame and grief and responsibility. Astonishingly, when the community were told that the boys would return to school within a couple of weeks there was no dissent. The boys were accompanied by a psychologist at all times. </p> <p>Trond Andreassen was the head psychologist at the child protection agency in Trondheim, and worked with the boys for four years until 1998. One of the things he remembers most clearly is how shocked the boys were. \"They were very afraid and confused. What we wanted to do was give the boys the chance to talk about what had happened, help them make sense of it.\" Did they understand what they had done? \"Yes, in the interviews with police they described what they had done in detail. Soon after one of the boys started school he asked the psychologist if they could go for a walk and he took him to the place where Silje was killed. The boy showed him what had happened.\" He talks about the way his team took the boys to Silje's graveyard and made sure they knew that she was dead.\" </p> <p>But how could the children understand the enormity of the killing if they were not punished? Andreassen asks what good punishment would have done. Like Beate, he believes their conscience punished them sufficiently. \"I don't think making them suffer is the way to make them realise what had happened. When you are continually punished for something you can't undo you have to do something to protect yourself so you begin to imagine it's not really you who did it. You develop a split personality.\" </p> <p>In Britain, Lord Woolf has talked about the rehabilitation of Thompson and Venables. Andreassen believes it's too late. \"What happened to them was to make sure the trauma was as great as possible. They've been exorcised from the normal environment. In Norway we were concerned to put the boys into as normal a situation as possible.\" Rather than coming to terms with themselves, when Thompson and Venables are released they will adopt new names, move to alien environments, be forced to literally re-invent themselves. </p> <p>How has Trondheim managed to move forward with so little bitterness? Andreassen mentions the size of the community, and the fact that it is just that - a community, an integrated society. Like everyone else in Trondheim he says whatever these children did they are still human beings. He talks about the two boys with affection, brings them to life. So different from the two callous murderers savaged in the British press. </p> <p>Laurence Lee was the lawyer for John Venables at the time of his trial. Lee tells anecdotes about Venables just like Andreassen does about the Norwegian boys. He talks about the time Venables asked to try on a QCs wig, and how he played Tetris with one of the defence barristers. </p> <p>Earlier this year Lee went to Trondheim to compare the Bulger and Silje cases for a BBC programme. He was astonished by what he found, slightly unnerved by the degree of forgiveness. \"I admired them to the extent that they are so civilised that the boys can survive without fear of retribution.\" But he thinks their tolerance borders on the overtolerant. He says at one point he wanted to shake Beate into anger. </p> <p>He is convinced that the Norwegian system could not work in Britain. Look at the numbers you'd have to rehabilitate, he says. But might it be sensible to increase the age of criminality from 10 to 15? Lee suggests we are too set in our ways; that these days there is so little respect , so little trust, that such a change would be exploited. \"Imagine if we said to the kids you can do anything you fancy till you're 15. They'd have a field day. There'd be absolute mayhem.\" </p> <p>Trondheim experienced its mayhem in October 1994. Since then life, for most of its citizens, has returned to normal. There were no copycat incidents, and Trondehim is again proud of its crime record. As Andreassen says, six years have passed, why should people talk about it now? </p> <p>And what about the two boys? Yes, he says, both of them talk about it a great deal. How are they? \"One of the boys is doing extremely well. He is functioning normally. The other boy is having problems. But we later found out that there were reasons for his problems, reasons that could explain what happened with Silje.\" I ask him if the boy had been abused. \"Yes, something like that,\" he says vaguely. Andreassen has spent six years protecting the two boys, why would he betray them now?</p>",
  "<p>Pity the artists of the Universal Ballet Company. Wherever they travel outside their base in Korea, the headlines have less to do with the quality of their dancing than with the fact that this is a \"Moonie company\" founded and bankrolled by the controversial cult leader Reverend Sun Myung Moon. </p> <p>Moon laid down the basis of his Unification Church in 1954, believing that other religions were failing to unite humanity with sufficiently rigorous messages of love. With himself as patriarch, he gathered a global \"family\" of acolytes, many of whom were tied to each other through mass weddings. The cult has been criticised for its hold over vulnerable people and for the riches that it has amassed. But even within the bizarre narrative that is Moon's career, the story of Universal Ballet strikes a pretty crazy note. </p> <p>In 1984 a young Korean dancer called Julia Pak was engaged to Moon's son. When her fiance died in a car crash, this sealed Julia's ties with the Moon family in blood. One month later Julia was formally married to the dead man and Moon founded a ballet company in his son's honour, with Julia as its prima ballerina. He now gives the company \u00a32.5m a year. Julia herself has been required to remain a faithful wife/ widow for the rest of her days. </p> <p>If all this sounds like the caprice of a rich and sentimental man, Universal Ballet has confounded its detractors by growing into one of the leading classical companies in Asia and on the international circuit. </p> <p>The company brings together Korean, American and Russian dancers; its repertory has always mixed Western and Asian styles, although the dominant influence is currently Russian: since 1998, Universal Ballet and its school in Washington have been run by ex-Kirov director Oleg Vinogradov. Reviews of the company speak of a corps de ballet as disciplined as the Kirov and of stagings of the classics that are meticulously produced. </p> <p>If Universal Ballet's reputation as a world-class ensemble carries huge PR advantages for Moon himself, beyond that the connection seems to end. It runs itself more or less like a standard ballet company. As for the dancers themselves, there is no evidence that they are required to commit to Moonie beliefs beyond observing certain rules of behaviour (no drugs or sexual promiscuity, for example). </p> <p>Universal Ballet is not unique in being the possession of a rich and powerful man: when ballet first evolved, it was the plaything of Italian princes, French kings and Russian tsars, and the 20th century has maintained the tradition. The Paris-based company Les Ballets 1933 was created by a wealthy Englishman as a vehicle for his dancer wife, Tilly Losch. Society beauty Ida Rubinstein founded a company as a showcase for her own talents. New York Ballet was formed when Lincoln Kirstein bought a choreographer (George Balanchine) to fulfil his vision of a new American ballet. </p> <p>Even state-run companies may depend on private patronage for their survival. Our Royal Ballet is not part of the Sainsbury empire, but it spends Sainsbury money and Lord Sainsbury is chairman of its governors. Still, while there have been wild rumours that Moonie literature will be handed out to audiences outside Sadler's Wells, punters at the Royal Opera House have never been pressured to join Sainsbury's loyalty card scheme.</p> <p>\u0095 Universal Ballet dances Giselle at Sadler's Wells, London EC1 (020-7863 8000), tonight and Saturday, and Don Quixote from Wednesday to Friday.</p>",
  "At first sight it is hard to imagine that anyone can have more to gain from the US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's groundbreaking trip to the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, this week than the people of Tae Song Dong. <p>As the only South Korean community inside the demilitarised zone - the border between North and South, which Bill Clinton once called \"the scariest place on earth\" - the 132 villagers have been on the frontline of the cold war for more than 50 years. </p> <p>In the increasingly unlikely event of an invasion by the North, their homes and paddy fields will be the first to be pummelled by artillery and overrun by tanks. But rather than feeling relief at the greatest chance of a thaw in half a century, the villagers - like many South Koreans - are beginning to wonder whether better relations are really in their best interest. </p> <p>Proposals to build a new road and railway across the border and talk of US troops being stationed in a friendlier North have raised fears that the DMZ, which has made Tae Song Dong the richest village in Korea, will disappear, along with their land, wealth, and a surprisingly pristine environment. </p> <p>\"Some of the villagers are worried that if the two Koreas get friendly we'll lose our benefits,\" said the mayor, Jun Chang-kwon, in a rare interview with journalists. </p> <p>The church, the school and the 50 homes of Tae Song Dong - called \"Freedom Village\" by US troops - are in a stunningly beautiful, if perilous place. The farmers' lush fields of ginseng, peppers and rice stretch across a broad plain to distant mountains in the North. </p> <p>As a virtual no man's land, the two-and-a-half mile corridor of the DMS is a perfect nature reserve, filled with wildlife. </p> <p>But it is hard for a visitor to imagine a more terrifying place to live. This is, after all, the point at which the 1m-strong North Korean army faces the 650,000-strong force of the South and its 37,000 American allies. </p> <p>The villagers are surrounded by barbed wire, minefields and tank traps; the landscape is pockmarked with memorials to fatal skirmishes; there is six to 10 hours a day of propaganda from giant speakers in the North; a curfew begins at 11pm; a platoon of South Korean soldiers sleeps in the village and provides the farmers with an escort as they tend to their fields. </p> <p>Even with this protection, the villagers live in fear of abduction. The most recent incident was in 1998 when two villagers were snatched while they wandered along the border picking acorns for a seasonal dish. </p> <p>Compared with the South Korean troops in sunglasses and crisp uniforms, the farmers are unlikely cold-war warriors, but in many ways they play just as crucial a role, overtly demonstrating the affluence of the South to their neighbours in Gi Jong Dongin the northern half of the zone. </p> <p>Gi Jong Dong wins only on the size of its flag pole, which bears a North Korean flag the size of a three-storey building. Tae Song Dong has a smaller flag, but it is ahead where it counts - in the income of its people, who can easily afford the best mechanised ploughing equipment, while farmers in the North still use oxen. </p> <p>This is no accident. The full military and economic weight of South Korea and the US ensure that the villagers of Tae Song Dong live privileged and protected lives. </p> <p>As the American military guides are eager to point out, the 50 families have an average annual income of $82,000 (\u00a356,000): more than five times the average South Korean income and at least 25 times as high as in the North. </p> <p>This is partly because the land is so fertile, but mainly because of the southern government's generosity: the villagers do not pay tax or rent, and they are exempt from military service. </p> <p>They are reluctant to talk to outsiders. The visiting journalists were told not to ask about reunification and the rapid move towards peace. But the mayor admitted that they had worries, particularly about the village property, which is claimed by the government. </p> <p>\"We have no deeds for this land. It is possible that it is owned by North Koreans, who will want to reclaim it,\" Mr Jun said. </p> <p>Property ownership is one of many complex problems that South Korea must resolve as it moves towards reconciliation. This, and the huge cost of rebuilding the North, have prompted the South Korean president, Kim Dae-jung, to suggest that reunification should take place over 20 to 50 years rather than suddenly as happened in Germany with the fall of the Berlin Wall. </p> <p>For the moment there is no significant sign of change in the DMZ.Though they would never say it, this may come as a relief to the villagers. </p> <p>They are certainly not opposed to peace, but the uncertainties of reconciliation must be unnerving to a community that appears to have grown numb to the perpetual threat of war. </p> <p>As the mayor said when asked whether it was frightening to live in no man's land: \"If I was the type of person who felt fear, I would have moved out a long time ago.\"</p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.kimsoft.com/korea.htm\" target=\"_new\">Korea Web Weekly</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.kimsoft.com/dprk.htm\" target=\"_new\">Democratic People's Republic of Korea</a></p>",

  "Nine months ago this column had a scoop. It was here that the world first learned that Ralph Nader would run for the presidency. The world turned over and went back to sleep. To the American press, beginning its lethal infatuation with GW Bush, Nader was an icon of the 60s who had passed his sell-by date. I had always admired the man. Few had done more for the American citizen than Nader and his Raiders in creating a countervailing force to big business and big government. But I can't say I was stunned that he got only the odd paragraph here when he finally announced. Hardly anybody came to his earnest little meetings. It seemed just another Quixotic candidacy. <p>Now everything is changed. Nader is besieged by the pressmen who found him boring only a few months ago. The New York Times gives up a lead editorial to castigate him for self-indulgence, \"ego run amok\". It would be piquant if it weren't so painful. Nader dominates the last few days because he threatens to be Teddy Roosevelt to William Howard Taft in 1912, Ross Perot to George Bush in 1992. Teddy split the right-inclined vote to let in Woodrow Wilson, Perot took 19% of the vote to let in Bill Clinton, and Nader is splitting the left-inclined vote to let in GW. Nader won't win a single state but in a neck-and-neck race he threatens to take enough votes from Al Gore to deliver Minnesota and Oregon and maybe also Wisconsin, Michigan and Washington to Bush. In short, to condemn the country to the forces of reaction he has spent his life fighting. I asked him to explain himself. </p> <p> <b> HE:</b> Why are you what the Times calls the wrecking-ball candidate? </p> <p> <b> RN:</b> I didn't know that the two party system was enshrined in our constitution. </p> <p> <b> HE:</b> But you will let in Bush who is against all you stand for. </p> <p> <b> RN:</b> These guys are both the same. They've given up government to the big corporations. </p> <p> <b> HE:</b> But surely Gore is closer to your position? You called Bush a big corporation running for president disguised as a person. </p> <p> <b> RN: </b> Gore is a stumbling person. If he can't beat a bumbling Bush with a horrific record in Texas, what use is he to us? Fact is, these Republicans in Congress are sons of bitches fighters and the Democrats are weak. And we have three things going for us if Bush wins. One, he doesn't like conflict. Two, he's stupid. Three, he's lazy. Actually the Republicans may even be better on corporate welfare. </p> <p> <b> HE:</b> But Gore has promised to make his first priority getting rid of soft money and Bush hasn't. </p> <p> <b> RN:</b> I don't believe Gore will do it. He and Clinton had plenty of time to do it in the last eight years. </p> <p> <b> HE:</b> But why don't you give Gore a break by backing out of the key states where you threaten him? </p> <p> <b> RN: </b> What would it take? He has not moved one bit to meet us. Not on making cars that do 30 to 40 miles per gallon, not on regulating bio-tech regulation... </p> <p> <b> HE:</b> You've attacked Gore on the environment but don't tell me his record isn't better than Bush, who incredibly won't move on global warming without more studies. </p> <p> <b> RN: </b> I agree Gore is better on two things. He'd keep the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge closed to drilling. He's good on the wilderness. But Gore has done some bad things. In the transition he gave the nod for an incinerator in Ohio he should have stopped. OK, he gets a D-plus and Bush gets a D-minus, but they both flunk. </p> <p> <b> HE:</b> You like quoting Alfred North Whitehead that duty arises out of the power to alter the course of events. Don't you a have duty here? </p> <p> <b> RN: </b> I'm not a referee, I'm not trying to be a kingmaker. I'm trying to build a progressive political reform movement. Thousands of young people are pouring in. Fifteen thousand people paid $20 each to get into Madison Square Gardens. We've had only 1% of the money, 1% of the media, we've been barred from the television debates and we've had to fight statutory restrictions just to get on the ballot in 45 states.Yet we're going to get millions of votes. But all I get is \"You're a spoiler, you're taking Al Gore's vote.\" Only Al Gore is taking votes from Al Gore. </p> <p> The gleeful Republicans don't see it that way. They reckon a vote for Nader is a vote for Bush. The Republican leadership council is launching pro-Nader TV ads featuring a speech in which he attacked Gore on \"eight years of principles betrayed and promises broken\". Of course, they have excised the Nader attack on Bush in the same speech. Ralph, meet your new friends. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto: comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>In a few days' time two things will happen that could reshape the global economy. The United States will elect a new president amid blanket media coverage. And, very quietly in New York, a door will close on the chance to influence the best kept secret in global economic governance - the United Nations-led finance for development process. </p> <p>The campaign that took Bill Clinton to the White House had as its slogan, \"it's the economy, stupid\". It answered the unspoken question: \"what's the big issue?\" If the question were now asked about globalisation, the reply would be: \"it's democracy, stupid\". </p> <p>Two thirds of the world's countries lack democratic control over their economies. In an age when financial institutions proclaim transparency, a simple comprehensive list of countries that are subject to hugely influential agreements with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund is not readily available, even to many of the bank's own staff. </p> <p>But why does it matter? The poet Dante said that, of all the hidden truths, the \"most useful and most unknown\" was knowledge of temporal world governance. </p> <p>If you tried to buy votes in a national election there would be allegations and court cases. At the international financial institutions, buying votes has been considered a virtue since Harry Dexter White of the US treasury department said at the founding of the World Bank and IMF, \"the more money you put in, the more votes you have\". That is how the Group of Seven wealthy countries, who do not use the organisations' services, came to control nearly 50% of the votes on their boards. It is the modern equivalent of 17th-century rule by aristocracy. </p> <p>All the developing and transitional economies put together, who rely on the institutions' services, control only around four in every 10 votes. At the United Nations General Assembly those same countries have more than eight out of 10 votes. </p> <p>Adding insult to penury, a committee set up to reformulate voting allocations at the IMF recently came to an embarrassingly wrong conclusion. The so-called \"Cooper Report\" suggested a scheme that would increase the United States' already dominant influence, and shrink Africa's small voice. The fact that Asia, too, would benefit little from proposed quota changes is likely to encourage those calling for a separate Asian Monetary Fund, one more in tune with the region's needs. </p> <p>The original vision for the UN included a role in global economic management to ensure more equal distribution of the benefits from trade and development. But, as the bank and fund have grown more influential, UN agencies have been undermined, attempts to control multinational corporations shelved and senior staff removed. </p> <p>Conservative philosopher Karl Popper wrote that an open society needed democratic institutions. He believed only genuinely democratic institutions could solve problems. The World Bank and IMF have proved appalling at solving problems. Popper also crystallised the inherent contradiction of the free markets, writing: \"The paradox of economic freedom, which makes possible the unrestrained exploitation of the poor by the rich ... results in the almost complete loss of economic freedom by the poor.\" </p> <p>Seen like this the financial institutions become enemies of an open global society. While they aspire to be universal, they ferociously protect minority rule of the world economy. Under this regime the anomalies and inequalities of globalisation have darkly flowered. But now there is a chance to correct historical wrongs, and reshape global governance. The UN has begun a little talked about process called finance for development. </p> <p>Technically, it is meant to try to give poor countries a better deal in everything from trade to aid. Its deeper mission is to write new terms of engagement between the UN and the World Bank, IMF and World Trade Organisation. But the first opportunity to influence the outcome and set the scope of the process will be over next week, almost before anyone is aware that it has begun. </p> <p>The street protests that seem set to haunt every international economic meeting are just another symptom of the global democratic deficit. They will welcome the new US president as representative of the largest vote holder in the institutions that guarantee minority rule. When his advisers wring their hands and in the coming months inevitably cry, \"why are the protesters getting at us?\" the president should turn to them and sagely whisper, \"it's democracy, stupid\". </p> <p>\u0095 Andrew Simms is head of the global economy programme at the New Economics Foundation</p>",
  "<p>The economic backdrop to next week's pre-Budget report could hardly be brighter. Inflation is below the government's 2.5% target despite more than eight years of strong growth and an ever-tightening labour market, the current account is widening but not at an alarming pace and the public finances are in good shape. </p> <p>With an election possibly just over six months away, the temptation for Gordon Brown to \"do a Lawson\" and conclude he has achieved an economic miracle must be intense. Thankfully, the chancellor signalled last week at the G20 finance ministers' meeting in Montreal that he would not be bounced into a rash pre-election giveaway. </p> <p>Mr Brown's caution is well founded. True, estimates of the likely budget surplus this year range from the Treasury's ultra-cautious \u00a35bn to well over \u00a320bn. In all likelihood, Mr Brown will be forced to revise upwards his forecast given the outturn for the first six months of the year shows a surplus of \u00a34.6bn. But continued modesty in his projections is to be welcomed. </p> <p>However, the British economy has been here before and it did not end happily. As Nigel Lawson demonstrated in the late 80s, it is easy to be deceived by a temporary improvement in public finances. Then, with money flooding into the exchequer, Mr Lawson slashed taxes in the belief that the economy's sustainable growth rate had shifted up a gear, only to leave his successors with a hole in the public finances when the UK went into recession. </p> <p>Today's situation is not dissimilar. Since Black Wednesday, the economy has been full of good surprises. It is tempting to believe that the supply side reforms of the 80s are beginning to pay off in terms of an increase of the economy's sustainable growth rate from its historic trend of 2.25%-2.5%. Estimates of 3% do not seem unreasonable. </p> <p>But it may also be true that low inflation is due to what Lawrence Meyer, a Federal Reserve board member, has in the US context called \"temporary bliss\" factors, such as the pound's surprising strength on the foreign exchanges, the massive deflationary impulse from the Asian crisis or the (previously) low oil price. In other words, luck rather than good policies may be responsible for the economy's remarkable performance. </p> <p>Faced with this uncertainty, it seems sensible to proceed with caution, basing forecasts for the public finances on a trend rate of growth of 2.25% and using any spare cash which accumulates to pay down debt rather than substantially increase spending or cut taxes just yet. </p> <p>Professor Laura D'Andrea Tyson, President Clinton's national economic adviser during his first term, was in London last week to deliver the Economic and Social Research Council's annual lecture. She reminded the audience that one of the foundation stones of America's new economy was the decision to cut the budget deficit in the early 90s. It made room for an easier monetary policy which, in turn, created a climate in the capital markets supportive of IT investment. And IT investment appears to have been one of the main ingredients of the US's productivity miracle which everyone from Japan to Germany is trying to copy. </p> <p>None of this prevents the chancellor distributing a few few fiscal lollipops next week. The margin of error built into projections of the public finances using a growth yardstick of 2.25% means Mr Brown can afford to make some minor concessions without endangering the long-term health of the public finances. He has already signalled that there will be some extra help for pensioners to make up for the infamous 75p increase last year. It is likelypensioners will be granted a temporary above-inflation rise to tide them over to the introduction in 2003 of a new pensioner credit, details of which are expected to be outlined next week. But there will be no permanent restoration of the link between earnings and pensions. </p> <p>Hauliers and the rural lobby can also expect to be grudgingly bought off with targeted measures such as rebates off fuel duty but their demand for a real-terms cut in petrol duty is likely to be ignored. Not only would it send the wrong signal about the government's attitude to the environment, it could also add too much pressure to demand when there is still a danger of higher interest rates. Standing up to the petrol protesters will be politically risky but a repeat of such a spontaneous event as September's fuel crisis seems unlikely, especially if public sympathy is watered down by top-up spending on health and education. This ought to be possible by switching money saved elsewhere in the Budget on unemployment or debt interest. </p> <p>From the chancellor's point of view, however, the meat of the report will be a range of micro measures designed to improve productivity, a yawn for the average voter but, in the long run, the key to preventing the tightness of the labour market spilling over into inflation. </p> <p>Generally speaking, two models of productivity are on offer: the European one, which succeeds by keeping unproductive people out of the workforce (downside: high unemployment); and the American one, which give all available workers lots of capital to work with but treats them like drones (downside: long hours and unhappy people). </p> <p>Mr Brown is trying to steer a middle path, introducing a wide range of measures to get more people into workforce, such as the New Deal, and improve their skills and employability through investment in education and training. </p> <p>He is also continually devising new ways of persuading the private sector to step up investment spending. The public and private sectors working together will, in theory, achieve a productivity breakthrough that will close the gap with the US, France and Germany. </p> <p>Micro initiatives can be expected from Mr Brown next week, including publication of the interim report by Paul Myners on the fund management industry which is likely to recommend reform or abolition of the minimum funding requirement, seen by the Treasury as a barrier to investment in venture capital. Mr Brown will also announce plans for a tax credit encouraging investors to put money into cash-starved entrepreneurial activity in poor urban and rural areas. </p> <p>Compared to the productivity improvements being forced on businesses by the strong pound (the government's unspoken policy for persuading manufacturing to raise its game), such schemes will achieve only marginal gains but they extract little cost and therefore seem worth trying. The trick Mr Brown appears to be attempting to pull off is to appear very busy while doing little that can cause harm. </p> <p>In the short term such a strategy may lack political excitement and, in the eyes of some, courage but in the long run it could reap big rewards. If the public finances continue to improve at the current rate, by next March's Budget Mr Brown could be able to offer modest, affordable tax cuts and hold out the the promise of a second Labour term characterised by further substantial increases in public spending. By holding his nerve, Mr Brown is likely to be in a position to spend a lot more in the future. Judging by his comments in Canada last week, he has realised this. Let's hope Number 10 has, too.</p>",
  "<p>Wednesday, dear readers, is National Stress Awareness Day, sponsored by Royal and Sun Alliance whose website - <a href=\"http://www.howtomanagestress.co.uk\">www.howtomanagestress.co.uk</a> - was WPM's site of the week a matter of weeks ago. For those who ignored her recommendation and who consequently remain unaware of stress, let WPM explain. </p> <p>Stress, it appears, is a condition that affects literally lots of office workers. Some, it is said, find the efforts of carrying their workload so draining that they resort to relieving the strain through unorthodox practices, rarely to be seen in the more serene office environments, such as swearing, throwing polystyrene cups across desks and, in some very extreme cases, assaulting colleagues with rolled-up fax cover sheets. So this week, instead of forcing such tiresome workmates into headlocks and locking them in a toilet cubicle until they calm down, be aware that they might well be suffering from stress. Best point them in the direction of a website. It will be more tolerant than you of their griping. WPM, of course, manages to spare her colleagues the excesses of her moaning by relieving herself of all her stresses and grievances through this column. As she's sure you're aware. </p> <p>* Bosses who think that there's no problems with stress in their firm should be aware that their employees are consummate liars. When questioned by mental health charity Mind about absences from work caused by stress, 27% of workers admitted that they would rather fabricate a purely physical reason for taking time off than tell their boss that they were suffering from stress. However, as 61% of people now cite stress in the workplace as the number one cause of mental illness, maybe it's unsurprising that the afflicted would rather confess to a hangover than to feeling under pressure. </p> <p>* Secretaries are often charged with making business travel arrangements for bosses who can't figure out for themselves how to get from London to Frankfurt. They are also often blamed if tickets go astray, planes are cancelled, hotels are double-booked or they forget to request a room with an executive trouser press or the correct fluffiness of the complimentary bathrobe. </p> <p>What can you do? Well, not much really. But you can stop your boss from being arrested or killed by not sending him or her to global danger-spots, which is bound to earn you brownie points back in the office (with the boss, if not the rest of the staff). <a href=\"http://www.hrworldclass.com\">www.hrworldclass.com</a> launched in the summer, and the site has now added a survival manual (the full monty will, however, cost you; details online) with advice on how to avoid some of the world's less pleasant stop-overs. Lebanon and Bolivia are not ideal places to organise your firm's international conference, for example. But there are also some less obvious hints, such as making sure it's not monsoon season and booking a room between the third and eighth floors (fire engine ladders often don't reach above the eighth storey, and robbers are generally too lazy to bother sniffing around those higher levels). </p> <p>And you can thwart the vanity of your jetsetting boss by pointing out that company logos on luggage are a big no-no - you might as well paint a huge target on your suitcase (well, at least it would match the imaginary one you've got pinned to their back ...) </p> <p>* The feelgood factor is all very well, but sometimes it pays to think negatively. What with all those dot.coms going bust, it seems a shame to waste money on, say, office space when all it'll be used for in the end is exit interviews and sacked staff crying in the toilets. If that sounds like your idea of a business plan, then Corpnex, a bright-spark property company based in Mayfair, has hit on the perfect solution. </p> <p>If you think your new company is likely to hit the rocks within a matter of weeks, then why not rent one of their offices for just three months. It does cost rather a lot, of course, but then your dot.com venture wouldn't be a real dot.com venture if it didn't spend its early life haemorrhaging cash. Staff might wonder at their boss's lack of faith in the longevity of the business, but then again the new, 21st-century flexible workers are all for short-termism and changes of scenery. Aren't they?</p>",
  "<p>Does your company offer you the chance to de-stress with t'ai chi or yoga classes at lunchtimes? An on-site vicar with whom you can discuss those concerns of work taking over your life? An afternoon philosophy workshop on ways to bring \"soul\" into the office? If not, it may only be a matter of time. Spirituality is set to become the biggest workplace fad of the millennium. </p> <p>Glenn Hoddle was among those who started the trend a couple of years back. Determined to improve the England football team's chances in the World Cup (ahem), he enlisted the help of Eileen Drewery, a faith healer. Around the same time, businesswoman of the year Prue Leith turned to a spiritual counsellor to map out her career. </p> <p>Law firm Mishcon de Reya was among the first companies to get employees involved. \"We sponsored a poet in residence who conducted seminars for everyone from secretaries to senior partners,\" says a spokesperson. \"All employees agreed that writing and analysing poems helped create an environment where 'deep' issues could be explored and then transferred to workplace matters. In turn, that broke down barriers and improved staff morale.\" </p> <p>Words are the tools of a law firm's trade, explains the spokesperson. \"So trying to think about other, more spiritual, areas, where words are equally important, seemed the per fect way in which to enhance our working environment.\" </p> <p>Rob Briner, an organisational psychologist who specialises in the link between work and well-being, agrees: \"It is finally being recognised that we need to appeal to employees' hearts and souls as well as to their minds and pockets.\" </p> <p>Indeed, workers in the UK may be among the most highly paid in the developed world, but they are also among the most unhappy, according to a recent survey. \"A mere 36% of British employees enjoy their work, with only Hungary and Japan more unhappy still,\" says Andrew Oswald, professor of economics at the University of Warwick, who conducted the survey alongside David Blanchflower from Dartmouth College in the US. </p> <p>\"There are far too many damaged people in workplaces up and down this country,\" agrees Father Dermot Tredget, a Benedictine monk from Douia Abbey, who campaigned for spirituality at work at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) conference last week. \"They have suffered through overwork, failing to balance work and home, failing to develop their emotional intelligence and being the victims of a 24-hour work-orientated culture. No wonder they're starting to insist, 'We're here to make a life, not just a living.'\" </p> <p>So stressed out have workers in the City of London become that they are flocking to the Reverend Peter Delany, vicar of All Hallows, close to the Tower of London. \"I get commodities brokers, traders, dealers and their support staff increasingly approaching me to heal the rift between work and the spirit - even if it's just during lunchtimes,\" he says, adding that it isn't necessarily a religious experience. \"Many of the people who come have never been to church in their lives. They're just after someone in the business of seeking deeper meaning to life.\" </p> <p>As a result of the growing interest, the local business community has helped the churches in that area to fund a stress clinic. \"It offers a range of holistic therapies such as chiropractic, dietary and osteopathic advice. These can work hand in hand with the spiritual chats employees have with the vicars,\" explains Reverend Delany. </p> <p>Mori, which has carried out research on \"spirituality as a phenomenon\", recently found that, along with reports of stress among the British workforce, there is also quite simply a growing sense of wanting more from the work experience. \"It seems to come from the recent focus on business ethics, environmental concern, socio-economic values and a rejection of hard-nosed capitalism,\" says Susan Walker, the managing director of human resources research at Mori. </p> <p>Professor Oswald adds that job insecurity is prevalent in the UK. \"In fact, a lot of people, particularly support staff, who feel this insecurity are unhappy, not because they constantly get laid off but because they constantly leave jobs of their own free will. The fear of insecurity, it appears, can leave workers feeling out of control, and they try to win it back by moving on before there's a chance that they can be asked to move on. The problem is that this is a vicious circle, causing them inevitable unhappiness as well as a failure to find any purpose in their working lives.\" </p> <p>Briner believes the trend towards employee assistance programmes and emotional intelligence has encouraged an office culture in which emotions are no longer taboo. \"Mention spirituality in the work place 10 years ago and there's a good chance you'd have got nothing but a snigger. Mention it today, and there's a good chance you'll get people who are genuinely interested.\" </p> <p>Indeed, in Bristol, the Reverend Harold Clarke, who leads the Council for Industry and Social Responsibility, has a range of business people approaching him on a variety of issues. \"A colleague is chaplain to Economic Life in Swindon, where two or three 'women in business' groups meet regularly,\" he adds. </p> <p>The 90s emphasis on teamwork is also responsible for the search for the spiritual, believes Briner. In fact, he says, improving collective working is one of the chief areas where employers - rather than just employees - can gain from spirituality at work, whatever form it takes. The theory is that understanding the role the spiritual dimension can play in our lives will help build better relationships at work and thus enable people to work more effectively. </p> <p>Father Tredget agrees. \"A spiritually-friendly workplace will be more than just a nice place to work. It will also be more profitable. Such workplaces will have greater staff retention rates, so lowering recruitment costs; see an increase in creativity and innovation; see improved morale, co-operation and teamwork and will see an improvement of the interface between the organisation and its customer-base.\" </p> <p>Relationships out of work can also be improved, he says. After all, research shows that the single biggest wedge between millennial couples is caused by work. \"People want to make sense of where work should fit into their lives, and have the chance to put their families first.\" </p> <p>Father Tredget predicts that \"understanding the spiritual will become such an important part of workplace human development that it will begin to regularly feature in management training, and will eventually have a place in some form or another in every organisation, no matter how small.\" </p> <p>So is it goodbye to traditional interviews, where you're asked to reveal your word processing skills, and hello to theatre and painting workshops where you'll be asked to reveal your \"inner child\"? Maybe not yet. But don't be surprised if your flexible benefits package starts to include the options of personal gurus and a lifelong subscription to a feng shui magazine.</p>",
  "<p>Only the hawks that hover over the ancient woodlands in the hills above Bath can see the whole of the big stone, steel and concrete E that is one of the finest new company headquarters in Europe. At ground level, the new Wessex Water Operations Centre is almost invisible, tucked into a tumbling landscape that offers misty views over the Limpley Stoke valley to distant Cley Hill and Salisbury Plain. </p> <p>The amazing thing is that virtually everyone in the building has access to these views, for this big office block, home to Wessex Water's 520 staff, is about as transparent as such a building can be. A lightweight building boasting high, coffered ceilings, big windows that actually open, and three tiers of open-plan offices sheltering two imaginatively landscaped courtyards, it is awash with daylight. </p> <p>By night, the building all but vanishes: architect and client wanted to keep night lighting levels as low as possible, so that the stars will continue to shine here. </p> <p>A concern for low-energy design and construction, artworks and landscaping has informed the building at every stage of its development. This is possibly the most energy-efficient company headquarters in Europe. Yet it is not some worthy, over-polite design, but a handsome, convincing modern building that manages to combine elements of the best new university buildings and air terminals. If you're going to spend much of your life in an office, it ought to be as good as this. </p> <p>The architects are Bennetts Associates, the engineers Buro Happold. The landscaping is by Bernard Ede/Grant Associates, the contractor Mace. Jonathon Porritt advised on ecological issues. The person who speaks for the management is Colin Skellett, chairman and chief executive of Wessex Water Services, a man who can proudly proclaim: \"I'm a water and sewage man, have been since I was 16.\" </p> <p>\"We want to work with the landscape and our natural resources as naturally, sensitively and efficiently as we can,\" Skellett says. \"And we want the staff to enjoy working here.\" </p> <p>Skellett attended a weekly 7.30am meeting with his architects. He saw the building through to completion and says there is nothing about it that he would change now that it is finished. He ought to be proud of it. For here is a building designed from the inside out that connects intimately to the landscape it lies so low in. Its lavatories are flushed by rainwater drained from its stainless steel and meadow grass roofs. </p> <p>The building runs broadly east to west, which reduces overheating from the sun on fine days and makes the most of the prevailing winds. In 2000 it is almost a privilege to walk through and work in a building without air conditioning or any other forms of health-threatening and dispiriting mechanical ventilation. Here is a building with relatively low levels of lighting: neither electric lights nor low winter sun dazzle. </p> <p>\"Perhaps it will be a little hotter on some days in summer,\" says Ian Taylor of Bennetts Associates, \"and a little cooler in winter than office workers have come to expect, but we're talking of a building in which staff have quite a degree of control over their environment and in which the total energy cost is about a third of that of a conventional office building.\" </p> <p>Similar concerns made themselves felt during construction. Old railway sleepers, for example, made up 40% of the rough aggregate used in making the concrete needed for part of the building. The idea was to cut down on the energy used in making concrete; this was further reduced by having the concrete roof vaults - good for thermal insulation - held up by a lightweight stainless steel frame. </p> <p>\"Throughout,\" says Taylor, \"we've tried to keep out any form of mechanical or electrical service that is either wasteful of energy or likely to go wrong. The building is sophisticated yet pretty innocent from a technological and ecological viewpoint.\" </p> <p>From the staff's point of view, too, the building has a transparency and serenity absent from most office buildings. Each of the three office wings connects seamlessly with an internal street where the library, meeting rooms and cafeteria are located. </p> <p>The manager of the secure 24-hour control centre and incident room is explaining how his box of computers works when he is distracted by a hawk hovering outside the windows. \"We see deer here in the morning,\" he says. This is a man used to working in windowless rooms and underground bunkers. Now he and his colleagues have some of the best views of all. </p> <p>\"It has made a difference already in terms of staff motivation,\" says Skellett. \"Since we've moved in, absenteeism has fallen - not that it was a problem. We offer a free bus service to staff that runs to Bath city centre; we expected a bit of mass emigration at lunchtime, but it hasn't happened. It's a lovely place to be.\" </p> <p>And it will be lovelier still come spring, when the gardens laced with meadow will become a romantic tapestry of wild English flowers, the pond will be alive with newts and dragonflies, and the gardens will be in full bloom. The idea is that staff can work outside in the courtyards and gardens on sunny days, eat their lunch outside or just sunbathe. </p> <p>This welcoming place is a million miles from the kind of local authority office of 20 or 30 years ago. The Wessex Water team positively welcomes visitors: there is an education room for schoolchildren and, when the gardens are in bloom, it would make a nice afternoon out on the free bus from Bath station. Perhaps the staff won't really want hordes of curious visitors trampling around their workplace, but when the architects have been encouraged to design the equivalent of a latter-day Oxbridge College with gardens to match, they might just have to get used to the idea.</p>"
