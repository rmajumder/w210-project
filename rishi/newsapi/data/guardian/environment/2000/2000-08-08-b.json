  "<p> There is one awfully long minute at the beginning of Rick Miller's 10-soliloquys-a-second Macbeth - set in Springfield - when, in the immortal words of Homer Simpson, you think, \"Doh! What am I doing here?\" A vision briefly passes before you of being locked in the bedroom of the world's most annoying, hyperactive teenager who insists on putting on a play in the voices of his favourite cartoon characters. Somebody get the Ritalin quick! </p> <p>Thankfully, the feeling passed. Within three minutes you suppress the urge to scream, despite the fact that Moe and Principal Skinner turn up as the witches, when surely Marge's sisters Patty and Selma were born for the parts. Within five I was warming to the idea of combining the TV series that is the unquestioned pinnacle of human artistic achievement with a play by some dead dude, and by the time Ned Flanders turned up as Banquo (\"Okallydocallydoo!\"), I was laughing like an idiot. </p> <p>Certainly, Homer as Macbeth is an everyman for ages to come as he utters such immortal lines as, \"Is this a dagger I see before me or a pizza? Mmmm...pizza\" and \"MacHomer shall sleep no more - and I love sleep.\" The doughnut of destiny has at last found a noble head on which to rest. </p> <p>Miller's Barney Gumble Macduff surely bears comparison with Olivier's as he avenges Mac Homer's destruction of his family and estates. He even killed Kenny. </p> <p>It is no wonder fellow Canadian Robert Lepage continues to try and harness this prodigiously gifted and manic mimic. He has his work cut out, for Shakespeare could not contain Miller, who rattled straight into a medley of rock-star impersonations to Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody for 10 minutes after the play finished. </p> <p>Dr Hibbert should prescribe a nice lie down.</p> <p> \u0095 Till August 28.

  "<p>Sir Alex Ferguson thinks he's mad; so does the man who runs the Cardiff City Supporters Club - not to mention many of its members - but Sam Hammam doesn't care. As his \u00a33.1m takeover of the relegated Third Division team nears completion, one question is dominating football conversation in south Wales: has the godfather of the Crazy Gang finally taken leave of his senses? </p> <p>After taking Wimbledon from the Southern League and making them into a feared Premiership team, the Lebanese businessman wants to transform the fortunes of the Welsh capital's club. </p> <p>As part of his plan to provide a team to match the city's status, Hammam has drawn up an audacious blueprint that both delights and outrages Cardiff City's supporters. In return for his money - \u00a3500,000 for team strengthening, \u00a31.5m to help clear debts and another \u00a31m to cover losses over the next two years - the prospective owner would like to see: Cardiff City become the Cardiff Celts; the club's colours change from blue to green and white; their bluebird symbol replaced with a Celtic cross; and Cardiff City become the Welsh team, possibly under the banner of Wales United. </p> <p>Hammam finally severed his ties with Wimbledon just before they lost their place in the top flight after 14 years. Under his leadership, the Crazy Gang had a field day. Expensive clothes were destroyed, graffiti was scrawled on opposition dressing room walls and intimidation - especially under Vinnie Jones - was the name of their game. </p> <p>Since selling out to a Norwegian consortium, Hammam has been on the look-out for a new toy, with 19 clubs - including Tottenham, Sheffield Wednesday, Portsmouth and Crystal Palace - reportedly in contention. After considering a move to south Wales in the early 90s when Wimbledon's relations with Merton council over Plough Lane reached rock bottom, he re-established the Welsh connection nearly 12 months ago. The Dons were playing Cardiff in front of only 2,272 spectators in the Worthington Cup at Selhurst Park. </p> <p>\"We beat them 3-1 but their fans outnumbered ours by three to one on the night - I couldn't believe it,\" says Hammam. \"I'm attracted to Cardiff because they're underdogs. I've been a fighter all my life - I fought for 23 years at Wimbledon and I want to prove the sceptics wrong again. Sir Alex Ferguson says I'm mad to buy Cardiff but there's something about City which I didn't see in any other club - a cause to correct, a dream to be achieved. I really feel very strongly that Cardiff City should be a Welsh club. </p> <p><strong> Marching army</strong><br>\"The change of name is something which we have to discuss very deeply with the fans - all I want now is the commitment because Cardiff can go places. We can aspire to compete with Bristol City or Birmingham, maybe even Coventry, but that's not interesting enough for me. I'm hoping that, within 15 to 20 years, we can aspire to compete with Liverpool, Arsenal or Manchester United. To do that, we have to be the team of the whole nation. </p> <p>\"If the supporters have the guts and the vision to become the marching Welsh army, then I think we have a chance to dream that we can compete with the best.\" </p> <p>In the two months since he first threw the beleaguered board a lifeline, Hammam has fallen in love with Cardiff City and their supporters - and they with him. Directors and fans have been seduced by an irresistible cocktail of money and passion. </p> <p>\"With Sam's genuine enthusiasm, you'd expect him to generate ideas,\" says the chairman Steve Borley, \"but nothing's cast in stone and you have to look down every avenue. Cardiff City has never just represented the capital; it's been the club of south Wales and we have supporters from all over Wales.\" </p> <p>The Wales United proposal has been given particularly short shrift outside Cardiff. \"With respect, I don't think Mr Hammam has done much research into Welsh football,\" says Carroll Clark, chairman of Wrexham Supporters Club. </p> <p>\"Bearing in mind the intense rivalry between Cardiff, Swansea and Wrexham, he hasn't got a hope of establishing Cardiff as the main club in Wales. I'm all for Welsh fans getting behind the national team - that's totally realistic. But this idea just isn't.\" </p> <p>Forty miles west of Cardiff, the chairman of Swansea City Supporters Club, John Button, is equally dismissive. \"I hope Mr Hammam is just being naive,\" he says. \"If not, it's arrogance at its worst. </p> <p>\"We didn't attract too many non-Swansea supporters when we were top of the old First Division. People support their own team and it's very difficult to change - you stick with your side through thick and thin.\" </p> <p>As part of his charm offensive, Hammam met 300 supporters on successive nights at Ninian Park last week and, by all accounts, went down a storm. </p> <p>\"The man has charisma and contacts which can only help the club,\" says Tony Jeffries, of the Cardiff City Supporters Club. \"He's totally bonkers - in the nicest possible way - but you don't get to be a multimillionaire by being an idiot. </p> <p>\"Sam's doing this for all the right reasons. Directors will have to pay for their match tickets and meals, and he says he'll work 24 hours a day, seven days a week and not take one penny out of the club. </p> <p>\"If Sam gets us to the top of the table or going for promotion, he'll realise that there's no need to change the club's name. People from all over Wales and England will come flooding back - which is what he wants. All he's asked supporters to do is to keep an open mind.\" </p> <p>As speculation persists that Bobby Gould or Joe Kinnear is about to replace the manager Billy Ayre, Hammam has already scored a spectacular success: everybody is talking about Cardiff City. He wants the deal giving him 82% of the club to be delivered by their first home game against Blackpool, a week on Saturday. </p> <p>As well as Hammam, Wimbledon and Cardiff have something else in common: Plough Lane and Ninian Park were both built on former council refuse tips. After his brass-and-muck success in south London, City supporters are confident his vision for their club will not become a load of rubbish.</p>",
  "<p>The high priests of globalisation meeting at the International Monetary Fund and World Bank annual meeting in Prague next month will attract the same level of ferocity from anti-capitalist protesters as they did in Seattle last year. They will also further blur the distinction between political and economic refugees, ensuring that those who are ethnically discriminated against at home become economically marginalised abroad. </p> <p>For the distinction between political refugees and economic migrants is a bogus one - susceptible to different interpretations by different interests at different times. The west is quite happy to take in economic migrants if they are businessmen (with the requisite \u00a3250,000), professionals, or technologically-skilled. It welcomes the computer wizards of \"Silicon Valley\" of Bangalore but does not want the persecuted peoples of Sri Lanka or the Punjab. And it is these it terms economic migrants - with all its connotations of scrounging. </p> <p>The west does not need, as it did in the immediate postwar era, a pool of unskilled labour on its doorstep. As economies move from industrial capitalism into global capitalism, businesses move plants to find such workers. Where they cannot, they demand that their workers be temporary and cheap. And the rightless and the illegals fit the bill nicely. </p> <p>Ironically, it is also globalism, with its demand for free markets and unfettered conditions of trade, that is eroding the distinction all over the world between the economic and the political realm. The nation state, particularly in the third world and the erstwhile eastern bloc, is the agent of global capital. It is capital that decides what to produce where and what to grow where and how. And through its aid and development agencies like the World Bank and International Monetary Fund and international trade agreements (such as Gatt and Nafta) and institutions like the World Trade Organisation, it holds the poorer regimes in hock. </p> <p>It then insists that they accept austerity measures, through so-called structural adjustment programmes that dictate drastic cuts in public spending, to pull them back from bankruptcy. The result is pauperisation, the erosion of educational, social and welfare provisions, the end of training and enterprise. It denies the possibility of indigenous growth or any hope for the future that is not tied up with foreign powers and foreign capital. Hence resistance to economic immiseration is inseparable from resistance to political persecution. The economic migrant is also the political refugee. </p> <p>That's a totally different world order from the one in which the politically persecuted refugee was defined in the UN convention of 1951. Then, the political refugee was being defined in terms of the shame created by the annihilation of Europe's Jews and the fear engendered by communist totalitarianism. But, already, a new category of political refugee was emerging in the newly independent states of the ex-colonies. </p> <p>During the colonial period Britain had collapsed diverse tribes, nationalities, ethnic groups and other geographical entities into unitary states for the purposes of easier administration and economic exploitation. As the west's neocolonial project began to displace indigenous economic development, the nationalism that had made the state cohere from independence began to give way to ethnic and communal divisions. And governments turned to using the trappings of democracy, especially the voting system, to establish authoritarian, majoritarian states - which systematically discriminated against and persecuted minority groups such as Ibos in Nigeria, Tamils in Ceylon and Asians in Kenya and Uganda. </p> <p>At first, these politically persecuted refugees were economically \"invisible\". In the 1950s and 1960s, when Britain needed all the workers it could lay its hands on, political refugees and economic migrants were all the same: they were labour. It did not matter that the Punjabis were fleeing the fallout of partition: what mattered was that they were needed in the factories of Southall. </p> <p>But, as Britain began to need less labour and its doors began to close, the claims of the persecuted came to be measured against the yardstick of economic pragmatism. The \"Kenyan Asian\" episode of 1968, when Asians with British passports expelled by Kenya were refused automatic right of entry to Britain, showed up the racism of Britain's immigration controls. But it was also the first clear indication of Britain putting its economic interests before those of the politically persecuted - even when they were its own citizens. </p> <p>In other words, the definition of political refugee and economic migrant became interchangeable. So that, just four years later, British Asians from Uganda were deemed acceptable as political refugees because they, unlike the Kenyan Asians, belonged by-and-large to the entrepreneurial class and could contribute to Britain's coffers. \"British\", \"alien\", \"political\", \"economic\", \"bogus\", \"bona fide\" - governments choose their terminology as suits their larger economic or political purpose. </p> <p>Nothing makes this clearer than the contemporary example of the Roma from eastern Europe. During the communist era of centralisation, minority cultures and ethnic differences were suppressed but were, at least, part of the citizenry. With the collapse of communism, however, they became outcasts, without employment, without access to full rights, discriminated against by state agencies and persecuted by untamed populist racial terror. By any yardstick, the Roma are a persecuted group like the Jews were earlier. And yet, when they seek refuge in western Europe, we reject them for the same reason that caused them to flee their country in the first place - that their culture and philosophy put them outside the pale of western European society. Once the underclass of communist totalitarianism, they are today the outcasts of western democracy. </p> <p>As global capitalism spreads and cold war ideological rivalries collapse, nation states in both the former \"black\" colonies of the third world and the former \"red\" colonies of the eastern bloc are beginning to break up. Political and economic categories have collapsed into each other and culture is becoming homogenised.The values we live by are more and more those of the market. </p> <p>Globalisation fragments our consciousness and casts us into individual, single-issue struggles that might bring about piecemeal reform but not radical change. That is why it is essential that we see how each struggle - whether against institutional racism, asylum laws, arms sales or unequal trade agreements - connects with the others within the overall campaign against globalism. So that even when we agree with the free marketeers that asylum seekers should be allowed to work, we do so, not because a free labour market is an imperative of globalism, but because it is globalism that deprived them of their livelihoods in the first place. Our fight should be for the asylum seekers and therefore against globalism. </p> <p>By the same token, any human rights convention that does not guarantee asylum seekers the right to a livelihood is irrelevant to the condition of our times. </p> <p>\u0095 Ambalavaner Sivanandan is director of the Institute of Race Relations.</p>",
  "<b>Why are we worrying about mobiles again? </b> <br>The public is being given mixed messages about how to use them safely. A report has just been published by the Department of Trade and Industry, suggesting that hands-free kits reduce the amount of radiation entering the brain from the phones. This sounds like common sense, but contradicts an earlier report by the Consumer's Association which claimed that the kits act like aerials and actually increase the amount of radiation emitted. As a result of that, many people gave up using the kits. Now they may begin again. <p><b>Is this all? </b> <br>No. Earlier this year, a long-awaited report by Sir William Stewart, the government's chief scientific adviser, on the effect of mobile telephones on our health was published. It did not give the phone industry a completely clean bill of health.</p> <p><b>So how safe are they? </b> <br>It's still unclear. The latest DTI report is probably right in recommending people use the hands-free kits - although the Consumer's Association disputes this, saying it used a different and better form of test. The real question is whether the radiation does any harm. Sir William Stewart's report discounted most fears, but suggested that youngsters should be discouraged from using them regularly or for \"non-essential\" calls.</p> <p><b>Didn't a previous report say there was no danger? </b> <br>A study last year by researchers at Bristol University concluded that mobile phones do not seem to harm habitual users. Indeed, it was reported in the International Journal of Radiation Biology that, rather than cooking the brain, a 30-minute handheld conversation could speed up reaction times. Tests on volunteers showed no effect on short-term memory or attention span after exposure to microwave radiation of up to 30 minutes. The only noticeable effect was that subjects reacted faster in one test involving a visual choice after the transmissions. That improvement was thought to be due to a slight warming of the brain leading to increased blood flow.</p> <p><b>So what has changed? </b> <br>The new report did not find any dangers but adopted a \"precautionary principle.\" The balance of evidence to date does not suggest that emissions from mobile phones and transmitters put the health of the population at risk. But if there were any, so far unrecognised, adverse effects, then young children would be much more vulnerable than adults, Sir William warned. More research may change our understanding of the problem. A leaflet providing clear, understandable information on mobile phone technology and related health aspects should be circulated to every household by the government, the report said.</p> <p><b>Why are children deemed to be at greater risk? </b> <br>The report said that preliminary scientific evidence found exposure to radio frequency radiation might have subtle effects on biological functions, including the brain. Children may be more vulnerable because of their developing nervous system, the greater absorption of energy in the tissues of the child's head, and a longer lifetime of exposure. The tiny pulses of microwaves emitted by mobile phones are of the same type as the radiation used in microwave ovens.</p> <p><b>What should parents do about these warnings? </b> <br>The report recommended that parents take greater responsibility for deciding whether their children should use mobile phones. Children should limit the time spent on their handsets. \"The widespread use of mobile phones by children for non-essential calls should be discouraged.\" Around one in four of Britain's 25m users is aged under 18 and more are expected to be signed up when the new generation of phones allow email and internet access. The National Family and Parenting Institute said parents would be disappointed with the recommendations. The NFPI's chief executive, Mary MacLeod, said: \"Parents need to have accurate information about the health risks so that they can make judgments about their children using mobile phones. Since there have been conflicting messages about the health risks of mobile phones, many parents may not be in a position to make an informed judgement.\"</p> <p><b>What about mobile telephone radio masts? </b> <br>The panel of experts working with Sir William, which included physicists, engineers and neuro-scientists, recommended stricter controls on the location of mobile phone base stations and masts. The report concluded that the balance of evidence indicated that there was no general risk to the health of people living near base stations, but there could be indirect adverse affects on their wellbeing in some cases. It recommended no further development should be permitted at existing base stations, including those with masts under 15 metres, and the location of new stations should be subject to the normal planning process. In relation to base stations located near schools, the inquiry team recommended that the beam of greatest intensity should not fall on any part of the school grounds or buildings without agreement from school and parents.</p> <p><b>What about research in other areas? </b> <br>Two experiments, one at Nottingham University and the other at the University of Washington, Seattle, have suggested that microwaves could produce stress in animals.</p> <p><b>And is Sir William following his own advice? </b> <br>He said that when his grandchildren, now four and two, were a few years older, he would not recommend allowing them \"unfettered access\" to mobile phones. He could see the benefit for children who might be out late at night having access to mobile phones for essential calls. The inquiry team could not provide further guidelines about how many minutes a day a child should use a mobile phone because it depended on variables such as how the phone was held, the type of phone, or whether it was hands-free. \"The shortest time that a child needs for essential calls is the amount of time it should use,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p> Traditionally, the word \"community\" conjures up village fairs or small groups of like-minded people getting together, but it has taken on quite a different meaning with the internet.</p> <p>It was not always this way. The first internet communities bore some relation to the original meaning of the word, formed by groups of scientists or people with shared interests, a world vividly and enthusiastically portrayed by Howard Rheingold in his classic 1993 book, The Virtual Community. Now \"community\" conjures up an image of commerce as much as of cosy fellowship.</p> <p>Go to any networking event, sooner or later someone with a new website or about to create one will utter the word like a mantra. Entrepreneurs harp on about community for several reasons. First, the larger the membership of an online community, the greater the number of advertisers attracted. Second, the community represents a mini mass-market for companies as the market becomes increasingly fragmented. </p> <p>With the advent of the internet, that hoary old chestnut, \"the customer is king\", becomes more of a reality. Customers can browse for bargains, making it difficult for a company to build up customer loyalty. The internet is a paradox: It creates a virtual global market yet fractures it into millions of pieces at the same time.</p> <p>Take Amazon.com. The online bookseller says it can ship to virtually any address around the globe, so the world is its oyster in a sense. The only problem is that other companies such as Barnes and Noble, its bricks and mortar rival, also sell books on the net. If Barnes and Noble offers better service and cheaper books, customers may desert Amazon with the speed of its tumbling share prices. Amazon's defence is to build up a sense of loyalty and community. </p> <p>In building up a community, Amazon also acquires data about customers. This data amounts to a valuable currency because the more a company knows about its clients, the better placed it is to offer them what they want, although it has to take care not to rile them over-eager marketing. Because of this database, Amazon can exploit the information to sell other products besides books, which is why it has branched into other areas such as tools and hardware, beauty products and electronics. Amazon is creating a virtual department store based on the relationships that have been developed through its client base. </p> <p>\"Amazon is more than just about selling books,\" says Gerard Davies, an internet consultant. \"It's about forming relationships and managing those relationships.\"</p> <p>The community thus is no longer a group of like-minded fellows, swapping jokes and recipes but a potential commercial nirvana to corporations. That is why entrepreneurs like Michael Zur-Szpiro, who has set up a site for home buyers and sellers called Mooov.com, harp on such much about community. The site - one of several devoted to the housing market - invites people to share their horror stories and runs stories about celebrities and their stories about moving.</p> <p>With the importance of communities, a whole new industry has cropped up around community building on the net. Amy Jo Kim, who has been building online communities for 10 years for companies like America Online and webzines, has written a useful guide for community builders. She sets down a number of fundamental principles, such as the importance of designing a site that can adapt to the changing needs of its members and of creating and maintaining feedback loops. </p> <p>\"Successful community building is a constant balancing act between the efforts of management (that's you) to plan, organise and run the space, and the ideas, suggestions and needs of your members,\" she writes. Other community gurus such as Cliff Figallo, part of the Futurize Now consulting group in San Francisco, also stress the importance of listening to community members. </p> <p>But as desirable as it is for companies to build or tap into communities, such close links to consumers can bring risks. Proximity to users gives companies a treasure-trove of data to exploit, but mistakes can be magnified to an embarrassing degree. Push the wrong button and a message can zip its way to the wrong person. Worse still, the wrong message can go to thousands of people by mistake. If that happens, companies have to be pro-active and apologise immediately.</p> <p>Companies really have to listen to customers instead of merely paying lip service to the notion. Mr Davis says companies are horrified when he urges them to give out the managing director's email address on their websites. What happens when he gets inundated with emails? He replies: \"It's a quick way of knowing if a company has got a problem, isn't it? So it's a good way of making sure the company doesn't make mistakes.\"</p> <p>mark.tran@theguardian.com</p> <p><strong>Useful links</strong><br><a href=\" http://naima.com/\">Naima.com</a><br> <a href=\" http://www.futurizenow.com/listen/work.html\">Futurizenow.com</a></p>",
  "The number of civilians prey to unexploded cluster bombs is significantly higher than admitted by governments, including the British, which have consistently suppressed evidence about the weapon's military effectiveness, according to a devastating report published today. <p>Cluster bombs, which contain at least 147 \"bomblets\" scattered over a large area, were used extensively in the Vietnam, Falklands and Gulf wars, and most recently during Nato's air assault on Kosovo. </p> <p>Cluster bombs have killed 50 people - about one a week - over the past year in the Serbian province, and injured more than 150, says the report by the UK Working Group on Landmines, a charity combining non-government agencies and funded in part by the Princess of Wales Memorial Fund. </p> <p>\"The unexploded bomblets effectively turn into landmines, ready to detonate on contact, causing death and injury to civilians even many years after the war has ended,\" said Richard Lloyd, the group's director. \"As many are brightly coloured and the size of a drinks can, they are particularly attractive to children.\" </p> <p>The report by Rae McGrath, a leading campaigner against landmines, shows the effect of cluster bombs in earlier conflicts is being ignored by confused and indiscriminate military strategies. </p> <p>Cluster bombs were dropped from medium and high altitudes during the Kosovo conflict despite official US assessments after the 1991 Gulf war that they were likely to miss their targets. </p> <p>The Ministry of Defence, which says RAF planes dropped 531 cluster bombs during the Kosovo war, quotes the manufacturer's estimate of a 5% failure rate. But the UN Mine Action Coordinating Centre in Kosovo gives a much higher figure. </p> <p>\"In Kosovo, preliminary statistics for the British RBL755 [a cluster bomb available on the open arms market] show that the failure rate is about 11-12%\", the centre said in March. </p> <p>Moreover, the MoD has itself admitted that the failure rate of cluster bombs used in the Falklands was at least 9.6%, nearly twice as high as the manufacturer's claims. </p> <p>The bomblets are designed to explode on impact but a soft surface or the presence of trees - cluster bombs were dropped against concealed targets in wooded areas of Kosovo - can lead to \"substantial failures\", today's report says. </p> <p>Evidence from the use of cluster bombs in Kosovo, the Gulf war, US military trials, and the Falklands conflict indicate that failure rates range between 9% and 30%, the report says. The difference between a 5% and a 9% failure rate in Kosovo would mean more than 3,000 more unexploded bomblets in the province. </p> <p>Cluster bombs are capable of turning huge areas into killing fields. The report says it is clear from censored figures that their use in Kosovo was disproportionate to any military advantage gained. </p> <p>It says official figures of targets destroyed during the bombing have been discredited by the release of details from the US Munitions Effects Assessment Team (Meat) which conducted a comprehensive investigation immediately after the campaign. </p> <p>The Meat report was suppressed - even the UN could not get a copy - and replaced by one written by the chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, General Henry Shelton, based mainly on interviews with aircrews. </p> <p>The Shelton report estimated that 140 tanks, 220 armoured personnel carriers, and 450 artillery pieces were destroyed in Kosovo. Meat's figures are, respectively 14, 18, and 20. The Meat team found that of 744 \"confirmed\" Nato strikes, there was only evidence of 58 successful ones. </p> <p>The 50 people killed by Nato cluster bomblets since the end of the bombing campaign include two British soldiers and a young boy whose death was witnessed by a 13-year-old friend. </p> <p>The friend, who underwent a double leg amputation, recalled: \"I went with my cousins to see the place where Nato bombed. As we walked I saw something yellow - someone told us it was a cluster bomb. One of us took it and put it into a well. Nothing happened... We began talking about taking the bomb to play with and then I just put it somewhere and it exploded. </p> <p>\"The boy near me died and I was thrown a metre into the air. The boy who died was 14 - he had his head cut off.\" </p> <p>In June, in its report on the lessons from Kosovo, the MoD described cluster bombs as \"an effective weapon against area targets such as a group of soft-skinned military vehicles\". It added: \"Nevertheless, we have learned that it would be useful to have a capability to strike single vehicles more accurately...\" </p> <p>Today's report says: \"The continued use of cluster bombs has cost thousands of civilian lives, denied land to the poor and disenfranchised and is now costing the international community millions to eradicate the unexploded submunitions... To continue this distortion of the truth [the official claims of a 5% failure rate] while ignoring the advice of experts from the military and civilian mine-clearance community, is unforgivable.\" </p> <p>Cluster bombs are not covered by legislation banning landmines since they are not \"designed\" to be detonated by people on the ground. Today's report calls for a new international law making governments, the military and manufacturers fully responsible for the clearance of unexploded bomblets and for marking affected land, paying compensation to civilians and handing over to the UN full records of cluster bomb deployment. </p> <p>As a first step, it says, there must be a global moratorium on their use, manufacture and sale, pending an in-depth review of their legality and impact. </p> <p><b>A global threat</b></p> <p><b> Laos</b> <br>More than 25 years after the Vietnam war, 500,000 tonnes of unexploded bombs remain, most of them cluster weapons.</p> <p><b> Falklands</b> <br>More than 100 British cluster bombs were dropped; more than 1,400 unexploded bomblets were cleared after the conflict.</p> <p><b> Kuwait</b> <br>More than 1,400 Kuwaitis were killed in incidents involving unexploded bombs and landmines after the Gulf war.

  "<p>Trying to value shares in Irish e-security firm <strong> Baltimore</strong> is a thankless task. Few companies inspire such a diverse range of opinions. </p> <p>The stock is one of the most volatile in the hi-tech sector, but yesterday it held steady at 640.5p. </p> <p>Some analysts believe Baltimore is on the verge of becoming a global power and a fairer value is around 900p; others rate them an outright sell. Nomura describes Baltimore as \"one of the most overpriced software stocks on the market\" - even after it fell from March highs of almost \u00a314. </p> <p>Nomura analysts say last week's deal with Commerce One in the US is indicative of their concerns. Under the deal Baltimore will supply its public key infrastructure to the company but the contract is non-exclusive and Baltimore did not put any monetary value on it. </p> <p>Nomura argues that Baltimore is valued as if it has proprietary technology and will make high margins. However, the standard it is based on is non-proprietary and Nomura predicts Baltimore will never earn much more than 20%-25% margin. </p> <p>Current market value of \u00a32bn is 46 times this year's forecast sales and 87 times 2002 forecast earnings. Nomura says this is unrealistic. </p> <p>What Nomura would like to see is a bigger presence in the US market, arguing that more than half of the world's leading multinationals are based in the US and the big decisions on security will be taken by corporate headquarters. Baltimore's US revenues are growing but mainly through acquisition. Further smart buys would help to calm some analysts' nerves. </p> <p>Dealing room whispers suggest a possible target is Entrust Technologies, a US rival that last month saw its shares fall more than 50% after warning that second-quarter earnings will be much lower than expected. It is valued at around $1.5bn. </p> <p>A combination of the two groups would be a very different proposition. Investors should hold, but be prepared for a rollercoaster ride. </p>",
  "A European commissioner must be given sole charge of managing the over-complex aid programmes if Europe is to make an impact on world poverty, a committee of MPs warns today. <p>In a caustic report on the slow pace of reform in Brussels, the Commons select committee on international development protests that the world's biggest aid programme is still too slow in delivering money and assistance. </p> <p>It also complains that Africa, Latin America and Asia get less than a quarter of the money put aside for southern and eastern Europe and the Middle East. </p> <p>\"We are exasperated with the failure of the commission to reform its development activity effectively. We have no doubt that, were the reforms we outline implemented, the EU could make a real difference to the elimination of poverty,\" say the MPs. </p> <p>\"The EU is living on borrowed time - the commission should give up its addiction to half-measures and have the courage to reform for the benefit of the world's poor,\" they conclude in their latest report on the effectiveness of \u00a37.5bn worth of EU development aid. </p> <p>The select committee's conclusions will be welcomed by the international development secretary, Clare Short, and Chris Patten, EU commissioner for external affairs. Both have strongly criticised an aid structure which takes an average, the MPs report, of more than four years to deliver aid to victims of global disasters. </p> <p>The committee wants to see the EU focus its efforts \"unambiguously on poverty reduction\" among the poorest people of the poorest countries, rather than the more complex aims which tend to give large sums to middle-income states - not even the best way of reaching the poor in those states, they say. </p> <p>At one stage six EU commissioners were involved in the aid programme, but the committee argues that the whole budget should be given to just one commissioner. </p> <p>Though the EU has only 2.9 officials to handle each \u00a37m worth of aid - compared with up to nine at the World Bank - they are wary of claims that extra staff are required. Only better procedures are meeded. </p> <p>As reported in yesterday's Guardian, the first \u00a35m of EU aid for the four central American republics stricken by Hurricaine Mitch in 1998 will not arrive until October. One local head of a non-governmental organisation programme in Pakistan remortgaged her house to pay staff while waiting for EU funds to arrive. </p> <p>Today's report was one of four on aid, including the committee's evaluation of Ms Short's management of the Department for International Development. </p> <p>Her efforts to improve Britain's bilateral aid programmes is praised by the cross-party committee, but it is critical of her willingness to commit too much aid to China despite its human rights record. </p> <p>In a separate report, Ms Short rejected earlier complaints from the committee, chaired by Bowen Wells, Tory MP for Hertford and Stortford, that Whitehall's response, by the Ministry of Defence and her own department, to the Mozambique floods was late. </p> <p>It had to be accepted that the British armed forces would not always be the best agency to deliver emergency aid on the ground, she said. </p> <p>At the time of the flooding, Ms Short decided to charter five helicopters locally for \u00a3870,000, and it was not until several days into the crisis that agreement was reached with the MoD for the provision of four RAF Puma helicopters and the Royal Navy vessel RFA Fort George.</p>",
  "The battered fortunes of the British seaside were given a lift yesterday when a nine-year-old boy rejected the whole of the rest of the world for Filey beach in North Yorkshire. <p>David Vater politely turned down an open global ticket from the charity Make A Dream Come True to opt for a free holiday with his family at Primrose Valley caravan park.</p> <p>\"He's been there regularly, he knows it and he likes it,\" said David's father, Thomas. \"He's always had a really good time at Filey and I don't think he saw any reason to change.\"</p> <p>David, who lives in Moortown, Leeds, and has the rare spine disorder infantile scoliosis, won the worldwide offer as part of a programme run by Make A Dream Come True for seriously ill children. Francine Levine from the charity said: \"It's completely up to the children where they go, with their families, and what they do. If they say they want to travel to Timbuktu, then we'll put them on the first plane there.\"</p> <p>David's decision, she added, was unusual. \"I don't think we've ever sent anyone to Filey before.\" Staff at Primrose Valley said they were delighted, and would try to give David and his eight-year-old sister, Kirsty, the holiday of a lifetime.</p> <p>Although less famous than nearby Scarborough, Filey has a golden beach, famous seabird cliffs at Bempton, and a natural pier of rock known as Filey Brigg.</p> <p>Flowers are grown in fields behind the town for pot pourri and \"everlasting\" arrangements, providing a blue and purple counterpoint to the North Sea.</p>",
  "In what must be one of the bleakest days in leopard history, officials in India revealed yesterday that they had recovered 18,000 leopard claws in the past year. <p>Each leopard has 18 claws so the haul means that at least 1,000 leopards - out of a population of 10,000 to 15,000 - have been slaughtered, wildlife officers said. </p> <p>The claws, which are worn by superstitious villagers as a source of strength, were only part of a dismal inventory that showed how rife poaching still is on the subcontinent. </p> <p>As well as the thousands of leopard claws and 137 tiger claws, the skins of 249 leopards and 21 tigers were seized by wildlife officers, India's environment minister, Babu Lal Marandi, said. </p> <p>The officers also found the skins of 221 blackbucks, an endangered species of long-horned antelope. The figures show that India's often lacklustre wildlife agencies are losing the battle against sophisticated poaching gangs. </p> <p>All 18,000 claws were retrieved in January during a raid on a house in the north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. According to S Tikadar, joint director of Project Tiger, an Indian conservation body, the figures are the worst ever. The skins and claws would have been poached over two to three years, he said. </p> <p>A spokesman for the World Wide Fund for Nature added: \"Leopards are in crisis at this point of time. We usually concentrate on tigers but we should be concerned about leopards now. The irony is that leopard populations remain strong in certain areas in the north of the country, in states like Himachal and Uttar Pradesh.\" </p> <p>The figures provide further evidence that the tiger in India is being hunted to the brink of extinction. Half of the world's 5,000 to 7,000 tigers live in India. </p> <p>While the official figure for India's tiger population is 3,500, some observers put it as low as 2,000. Most tiger parts are smuggled to China, Japan and south-east Asian countries where they are used in traditional medicine and as aphrodisiacs. </p> <p>Police say their intelligence indicates that people engaged in wildlife crime also have links to drug and weapons trafficking.</p>"
