  "<p>At least one person a day dies at work in the UK. And no, it's not only in nuclear power stations, or down the few remaining coal mines. It's in regular working environments, mostly as a result of falls. What's more, 2.2m people have to take time off because of work-related health problems, resulting in 13bn working days being lost annually. </p> <p>There's worse news still for recruitment agency workers, who make up a significant proportion of the army of support staff, according to the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). \"We have found that recruitment agencies in this country are unclear as to what their health and safety responsibilities are towards workers registered with them,\" explains Frances Gilbert of Bostock Marketing Group, the company that carried out the research for the HSE. \"This means that recruitment agency workers may not receive the same level of health and safety protection as other employees.\" </p> <p>In other words, temps get a raw deal when it comes to staying safe at work. Nobody, after all, seems quite sure if it's the agency or the host employer who is responsible for looking after them. Mel Draper, head of HSE's policy division, argues that \"although most recruitment agencies and host employers claim to exchange information on capabilities, training and health and safety features of the job, the fact remains that a poor level of awareness of health and safety legislation exists.\" </p> <p>As a result, temps may not be issued with safe and comfortable work stations, which are essential in decreasing the risk of ailments including severe back and neck pain and repetitive strain injury (RSI). In addition, they may not be using computers with glare-free screens and adjustable brightness and contrast controls that avoid damaging eye-sight. They may not be warned about fire exits and danger spots around the building, and they may be expected to work in an area surrounded by lethally stacked boxes and cabinets. And, crucially, they may not know at whom to direct their frustration when they find themselves confronted with these situations in an unfamiliar office. </p> <p>Suing a company for damages, now a widely accepted action for any one injured at work if the employer is to blame, is a further grey area for the temp. If they don't know if it's the agency or the hiring employer which is supposed to take reasonable care for their safety - and provide them with safe equipment, plant and premises, adequate supervision and proper training - then they don't know from whom to seek compensation. </p> <p>The HSE's report reveals that around half of all recruitment agencies do not have measures in place to ensure they are fulfilling their health and safety obligations, and that joining a smaller temping agency is particularly risky. In fact, research shows that, whether or not you're a temp, you are twice as likely to be hurt in an industrial accident if you work for a small firm than a large one. According to the Health and Safety Commission (HSC), many smaller businesses \"have greater difficulty understanding their legal duties and are unclear about the action they should take.\" </p> <p>So what's the solution? How can support staff - especially temps - make sure they're safeguarded in the future? According to Belinda Brooke, legal adviser for the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC), a good start would be for agencies, host employers and temps themselves to learn the facts about the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974. \"In fact,\" she argues, \"we believe most agencies already know them.\" </p> <p>It works like this. There are two types of agencies: those, such as Manpower, where the temp is fully employed by the agency; and the majority, including Adecco, where the temp is engaged by the agency under a \"contract for services\". \"You'll only know which kind you belong to by asking,\" advises Brooke. \"In the first case, it's the agency that is the employer and health and safety is therefore its responsibility. </p> <p>\"In the second case, the responsibility is split. Before you go to any assignment, the agency has a duty to advise you of any accident or health-risk that could occur as a result of the type of work. Say you're doing a copytyping job, you could expect the agency to warn you that there'll be a lot of typing - so if you suffer from RSI, you would have the chance to refuse the job. Additionally, it must tell you who to approach within the host company to inform you about health and safety issues related to the premises.\" </p> <p>In both cases, adds Brooke, the employer has a general duty of care for anybody - even if they are self-employed - who is on their premises, but that is legally \"weaker\" than the Health and Safety at Work Act. \"It's complicated,\" she acknowledges, \"but worth getting your head round so that you can make sure you have minimised all risks before you begin any assignment.\" </p> <p>So complicated has the legislation become, admits the government, that over the past 18 months, it has, through the HSC, been looking at ways to simplify it. Revamping the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 could, for instance, be something of a solution itself. The problem is that the original act presumed that companies would continue directly to employ most of their workforce. It did not envisage large numbers of people being self-employed, part-timers or sub-contractors. And it certainly didn't envisage the fact that the majority of the secretarial sector would be temping. This means that the supply chain among businesses has become complex, once again leaving ambiguity about who is responsible for health and safety. </p> <p>A further way forward for secretarial staff may be to introduce tougher legislation that protects workers from violence at work. According to the HSE, there has been a significant increase in the number of violent attacks by colleagues and clients. And while the British Crime Survey does not have a specific category for workplace violence - making figures hard to come by - it does note \"acquaintance violence\" which accounts for about half of all attacks on men and a third of all attacks on women. An incredible 23% of these incidents involve a customer or client, and around 20% occur at work. </p> <p>\"Receptionists and other secretarial staff who deal with the public may be particularly at risk because they're often the first point of contact for aggressive customers or clients,\" stresses Sarah Simpson, training director for the Suzy Lamplugh Trust. \"There are, in fact, five pieces of legislation relevant to violence at work including, above all, the good old Health and Safety at Work Act 1974. But many employers think health and safety has nothing to do with personal safety. In consequence, a lot don't react until something terrible happens.\" </p> <p>Andrew Pemberton, director of Human Focus, a company helping employers to reduce accidents and health risks, is, however, resolutely positive about the future. \"We have opened the first UK centre aimed solely at helping employees with neck and spinal pain back to normal work duties, and it has been enormously popular. I'm the first to admit that I don't believe that's because companies are increasingly caring towards their staff. I believe it's because they are finally becoming more financially aware of health and safety. </p> <p>\"Health and safety failures cost Great Britain up to \u00a318bn per year. More and more companies are learning this by the day and if that's not a good enough reason to start protecting staff, I don't know what is.\"</p>",
  "<p>How was it for you? Was your first experience of an England football international televised on pay-per-view as pleasurable as you hoped? </p> <p>There has been plenty of anecdotal feedback - ranging from my own, which was a hitch-free experience in a pub in Battersea, to stories of cats being unceremoniously booted across living rooms (or, in Harry Redknapp's case, across his office at West Ham). </p> <p>u&gt;direct, the independent pay-per-view broadcaster who parted with \u00a33 million for the rights to Finland v England, have always been coy about disclosing the number of viewers. They would say only that everyone who registered at least 20 minutes before kick-off - and provided their correct details - saw the match without any problems, but some of those who left it until the last minute experienced delays. </p> <p>'We hope customers in the future will understand that early registration is essential,' said Roger Hall, u&gt;direct's marketing manager. </p> <p>So, do they have a future? Quite possibly. Global Sportnet, the Hamburg-based company who were responsible for delivering the Finland-England match to u&gt;direct, have replaced CSI Octagon as agents for the Greece-England game next June, which is the only World Cup qualifier still to be allocated to a TV broadcaster and is now likely to be a key fixture on the qualifying road to the 2002 World Cup finals. </p> <p>Thomas Martens, the head of Global Sportnet, was still evaluating the reaction to the Helsinki match when I spoke to him, but said: 'It is not impossible that the match [Greece v England] will be broadcast on pay-per-view again. At the moment, it is open. </p> <p>'The Finland match was an experience, a trial, not so much for us as for England and u&gt;direct. We'll have to see, but I believe that it could have an impact on future matches being broadcast on pay-per-view, not only those involving the national team but also club games in Europe.' </p> <p>If Global Sportnet decide to seek a pay-per-view partner, u&gt;direct will find they have few rivals to do the broadcast. Sky are letting it be known that they are not interested in screening England on a p-p-v basis. </p> <p>In the long run, of course, the success of pay-per-view broadcasting will depend on how many of us encourage those responsible by subscribing to it. </p> <p>While Finland's footballers were frustrating England last Wednesday, the Finnish FA were driving executives of the online betting site, Eurobet, to distraction. </p> <p>Eurobet, the internet arm of Coral's, had booked perimeter advertising space inside the Olympic Stadium, but the Finns barred their boards from being displayed, saying there were legal problems with regard to the state lottery, Velkkaaus, who just happen to be one of the main sponsors of Finnish football. </p> <p>The fact that the match was a double production, and the pictures beamed to the UK were not seen by viewers in the host nation, made no difference to the Finnish authorities' stubborn stance. </p> <p>Greg Dyke played some fairly aggressive frames, it seems, during the negotiations that have ended up with the BBC keeping the world snooker championship until 2006. </p> <p>Reports reach me that the director general faced down the World Snooker Association's attempts - led by the now departed chief executive Peter Middleton - to more than double the money they receive from the Beeb for the world event plus three other tournaments. </p> <p>In the end they had to settle for around \u00a323 million, which was only a modest increase on the \u00a318.8m they received for the previous five-year deal. </p> <p>Also, Dyke has insisted on retendering the production contract after next year's world championship. At present it is held by TWI, who have also been responsible for the TV negotiations.</p>",
  "<p>The Karimabad and Baltit project on the terraced slopes of Hunza, part of the Karakoram range in northern Pakistan, was one of six section winners in the awards which recognise environmental responsibility in the tourism industry. It was chosen as the global winner by a panel, chaired by Professor David Bellamy, which included 17-year-old Leeds sixth-former Lizzie Ashworth who was chosen as the young judge in an Observer competition. </p> <p>Professor Bellamy said that Lizzie made a crucial contribution in the decision by a panel that included Sir Crispin Tickell, convenor of the UK Government Panel on Sus tainable Development, and Ross B. Simmons, director of the Smithsonian environmental research centre. </p> <p>The \u00a31 million project, developed by the Aga Khan Trust for Culture, restored the Baltit Fort as a museum and cultural centre, creating new income and opportunities for the 5,000-strong village. It attracts 20,000 visitors a year, half of them from outside Pakistan. Access is limited to pedestrians and only 25 visitors are allowed at a time. The fort earned \u00a330,000 in fees from visitors but brought indirect revenue of around \u00a3110,000 to the community. </p> <p>The restoration was part of a wider regeneration of the area. Meltwater from a glaciers was captured to allow the cultivation of terraced fields and orchards, an arts and crafts centre created jobs for villagers and a new waste system was introduced.</p>",
  "<b> 26 It's like blue eyes or black hair - something you get from your parents</b> <p>Sometimes, yes, but mostly, no. The best evidence comes from a giant twin study - 44,000 pairs of them. Done by the AICR and published in July, it found that even identical twins have only a 10 per cent chance of developing the same cancer. The study estimated that '60 to 70 per cent of all cancers can be avoided by making small, ongoing changes in what we eat and how we live'. Smoking was said to be the number one cause - 35 per cent. In second place was diet, with 30. The accepted genetic element across all cancers is no more than 10 per cent. Within that figure, though, are three cancers with a strong heritable (the word scientists prefer to genetic) component. The twin study gave prostate at 42 per cent, colorectal at 35, and breast at 27. Although there seems to be general agreement about prostate cancer, other researchers disagree on the heritable level of both colorectal and breast. A common figure given for colorectal is 10, but Colon Cancer Concern gives just 6 per cent. And, according to Professor Alan Ashworth of the Breakthrough Toby Robins Breast Cancer Research Centre, London, only 5 to 10 per cent of breast cancers are familial. These are caused by mutation in the genes BRCA1 and BRCA2. If a woman has either of those, 'it is 85 per cent likely she will develop breast cancer by the age of 70'. </p> <p>What you really want to know, of course, is whether you'll get it. If your parents had cancer, the thing to look out for is if they got it before they were 55 - after that, you're just dealing with the ravages of life. If either parent got colon cancer before they were 55, for example, your odds of getting it are twice what they would have been if your parents had waited until after their 55th birthday - though your odds are still markedly worse than for someone whose parents didn't get it. Even if your family does have a cancer gene, it doesn't mean you're certain to get it. Like blue eyes or colour blindness, it follows the laws of Mendelian genetics What is genetic is your response to drugs. Soon, a simple DNA test - via a finger prick or mouthwash - may make it possible to match the patient to the drug which will be most effective and least unpleasant.</p> <p><b> 27 Most heavy smokers will die of lung cancer</b></p> <p>No. According to US figures, a surprising 85 to 90 per cent of the top risk 20/20s (20 or more gaspers a day for 20 or more years) will not get lung cancer, though they'll probably die younger anyway of a stroke or a heart attack. But the fact is that even the link between smoking and lung cancer is not 100 per cent: something else must be going on - probably a combination of genetics and diet. But - and it's an enormous but - lung cancer has a terrifyingly low survival rate, just 5 per cent. It is the third commonest form of death in the UK. Also, according to the CRC, one-third of all cancers are linked to smoking and it's a major factor in at least 12 different ones. The ICRF adds that 90 per cent of all lung cancers are caused by smoking and that 50 per cent of all persistent cigarette smokers will eventually be killed by their habit. Which also means, of course, that 50 per cent won't. Evens ain't great odds, though, is it.</p> <p><b> 28 Antioxidant supplements accelerate lung cancer in smokers</b></p> <p>The experts are deeply divided on this. Yes, say a pair of trials conducted by the CRC, which showed betacarotene increasing the risk. Yes, says the AICR. No, says Professor Sir Richard Peto. He points to a third trial conducted over a much longer period which showed no such association. A big study run by a Boston hospital, it involved 22,000 American doctors - half took 50mg doses of betacarotene, half took a placebo. Its conclusion: 'Twelve years of supplementation with betacarotene produced neither benefit nor harm in terms of death from all causes.'</p> <p><b> 29 People who smoke only one or two cigarettes a day have nothing to worry about</b></p> <p>No, but the risk is what scientists call 'linear'. Smoking 20 a day gives you an overall 50 per cent chance of dying from the effect - not just cancers but heart and lung disease, too. Smoking two a day brings that risk down to 5 per cent - still the most dangerous thing smokers do in their lives. Scientists are also sceptical about people's ability to stick to two a day. According to ICRF, smokers who stop in middle age avoid most of their later risk of being killed by tobacco, and those who stop before middle age avoid nearly all the risk. People giving up is the main reason lung cancer is dropping faster here than anywhere else in the world. Are cigars safer? Yes, but only if you don't inhale. Also, you run a higher risk of mouth and throat cancer. Is passive smoking really that dangerous? Officially, yes. The estimate is that it kills 300 a year in the UK - the cancer risk is probably 2 per cent of the active smoking risk. Some researchers are still not convinced, though, about the seriousness of the risk. Dr Ken Denson of the Thame Thrombois and Haemostosis Research Foundation says 10 cigarettes a day is fine, that passive smoking is not a problem but that smokers get lung cancer because of their poor diet. Others say that the Thame Thrombois and Haemostosis Research Foundation is a tobacco industry apologist.</p> <p><b> 30 I've got a cough, therefore I haven't got lung cancer</b></p> <p>Er, no. A cough occurs in 80 per cent of lung cancers. </p> <p><b> 31 Not all lung cancer is caused by smoking</b></p> <p>True. According to the ICRF, one in 20 UK cases is caused by radon, the natural gas which leaks up from the earth, particularly in the West Country, and accumulates in houses. However, says an epidemiologist, these 'findings are just at the border or what can be detected in epidemiologic studies. It's actually a pretty small number of lung cancers, particularly in non-smokers.'</p> <p><b> 32 Infertility treatment increases your risk of ovarian cancer</b></p> <p>Sadly, probably so. Basically, it seems that the more eggs a woman produces, the higher her risk. So pregnancy and the pill both reduce that risk, while women who start menstruating early and finish late face an increased chance of getting it. It's as if, over millions of years, women developed reproductive systems that were balanced around their reality of their lives - late puberty because of bad diet, followed by lots of pregnancies (if not always live children) and then an early death. Modern life not being like that, the system is out of whack - and prone to cancer.</p> <p><b> 33 You're more likely to die of it here than in Europe or the US</b></p> <p>True - probably. Cancer researchers are wary of making direct comparisons, but there does seem to be a clear difference. The best comparison is what statisticians call 'age-standardised death rates per million' - that means there is no bias against countries with an ageing population. According to the ONS, for England and Wales, a male figure of 2,674 is slightly worse than Europe's 2,432. When it comes to women, though, the difference is startling - 2,464 to 1,672. It's also widely accepted that our overall survival rate is 40 per cent compared with some of Europe's 50 per cent. In the US, 60 per cent of patients now survive at least five years. For colorectal cancer, the UK survival rate is around 40 per cent compared to Europe's 45 and 60 in the US.</p> <p><b> 34 Loads of children get it and they invariably die</b></p> <p>Not at all. Cancer is overwhelmingly a disease of age. Look at the very latest figures, in the autumn 2000 edition of Health Statistics Quarterly. The peak for both men and women comes at 70 to 74 years of age. Just 5 per cent of male cancers and 9 per cent of female cancers occur in under-45s. And children? Under-15s account for just 0.6 per cent of all cancers - though that's still 1,200 to 1,300 cases a year. A third of those are leukaemia (which is not particularly heritable, by the way) but even there the outlook is neither as it was nor as bleak as people think. Improved chemo routines and refinement of bone-marrow transplants have cut childhood leukaemia deaths by 57 per cent in the US and 50 per cent here. The UK recovery rate for childhood cancers is 60 per cent overall, 90 per cent for some. That's why there are 18,000 survivors out there. On the other hand, it's still the most common cause of death from illness in children.</p> <p><b> 35 Only humans get it</b></p> <p>Not true. Domestic and farm animals and birds and fish all get it. Wild animals? Mostly, no. They don't live long enough to get it - because they don't have the antibiotics and medical care we give to our pets and prospective dinners. Recent US research, though, suggests those other top-of-the-food-chainers, sharks, do get it.</p> <p><b> 36 You can get it from the barbie</b></p> <p>Maybe, but unlikely. The blackened crust on a piece of BBQed meat or fish contains heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAAs), which are certainly carcinogenic. The same applies to grilling and frying in very hot oil. In fact, no one has actually been able to implicate barbecuing in cancers. Also, according to the ICRF, lab tests that showed the DNA damage, which is central to the cancer process, used much higher doses of the chemicals than humans consume - though it still recommends not eating large quantities of charred food. The AICR also issues an annual warning at the start of the summer grilling season. It recommends avoiding charred food and eating grilled meat and fish only occasionally. If you must, it advises using lean meat (bye bye ribs, so long bangers), cutting the fat and skin off, removing any charred sections and using tongs - puncturing the surface allows fat to drip down and cause flame-ups, which produce another kind of carcinogen, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). However - and it's a big, happy however - you can cut the risk by marinating the meat or fish. Lab tests produced a 99 per cent reduction in HCA and even brief baths in the marinade 'produced significant reductions'. Why? Scientists guess it's because typical marinade ingredients - vinegar, citrus juice, herbs, spices, olive oil - are famously full of the anti-cancer good stuff. Would that then mean that barbied fruit and veg aren't a problem? It would. They pose no known health risk, according to AICR director of nutrition education, Melanie Polk. 'And if you're looking for an exciting but healthy summertime dessert, try grilled fruit. The grill's heat caramelises the fruit's sugar and lends a more intense and deliciously sweet flavour.'</p> <p><b> 37 Scotland is the cancer capital of the world</b></p> <p>There's some truth in that. Scottish cancer rates have been steadily increasing for years, particularly among poor men. The guess is that they are slower in seeing a doctor - and early diagnosis is closely linked to survival. The Scottish Cancer Intelligence Unit made international comparisons, with the US and a range of European countries, including England and Wales (still a unit, as far as statisticians are concerned). It reported: 'In both sexes, incidence and mortality rates were among the highest, whereas survival was the lowest.' Though perhaps no worse than England and Wales, according to the report.</p> <p><b> 38 High-earning whites are more likely to get testicular cancer than black men</b></p> <p>Odd but true, according to the CRC.</p> <p><b> 39 Cancer is caused by stress</b></p> <p>Doesn't seem so. There is, however, some evidence that stress may trigger relapses. A late-80s study by Professor Amanda Ramirez of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund Psychosocial Oncology Group compared female breast cancer victims who'd had a relapse with those who hadn't. Those who got it again were significantly more likely to have suffered traumatic life events - divorce, bereavement, bankruptcy, etc. Professor Ramirez thinks any potential link here is hormonal - oestrogen levels in the case of breast cancer. </p> <p><b> 40 Too many kippers will give you stomach cancer</b></p> <p>Yes and no. While it's true that there is an established link between stomach cancer and a diet heavy in smoked and/or pickled foods, you have to eat them in quite un-British quantities. 'The cause of the association is not clear, however,' said David Forman, professor of cancer epidemiology at the University of Leeds and honorary consultant to the ICRF. 'Preserved foods of this kind are often consumed as part of a poor diet, deficient in fresh fruit and veg. So it is unclear whether it is something in the smoked/pickled foods themselves or the lack of fresh food - or both - which increases the risk.' The classic example is Japan, where even now they don't eat much fruit and veg. Stomach cancer is closely linked to the bacterium Helicobacter pylori - according to an international study led by Dr David Forman, those infected are six times more likely to develop it.</p> <p><b> 41 The sun gives you skin cancer</b></p> <p>Ish. The fairness of your skin is the crucial factor. The paler it is, the greater the risk. The highest incidence of melanomas is in Queensland, Australia, the lowest is in Bombay - not exactly a sun-free spot. </p> <p><b> 42 Selenium protects against cancer, and therefore I should take it as a supplement</b></p> <p>Respectively, yes and no. Selenium does seem to help with lung, colon, oesophagal and prostate cancers - heart disease, too. 'It's a potent antioxidant which can block cell DNA damage,' says Dr Peter E Newburger of the University of Massachusetts Medical School. It helps the enzymes which break down the free radicals that damage cells. But you almost certainly already get enough selenium in your diet - 55 micrograms a day for women, 70 for men. Too much can have serious side effects, from nausea up to cirrhosis of the liver. 'It's toxic when taken at high levels,' says Dr Newburger. 'This is not a case of: if a little is good, a lot is better.'</p> <p><b> 43 Children who live near nuclear power plants get more cancer</b></p> <p>Probably not. Despite extensive and continuing investigations of links between childhood cancers and nuclear installations, no clear clear risk difference has yet been established. Childhood leukaemia is caused by a mix of genetics and environment, it seems. A child is born with leukaemic cells but doesn't develop the disease until three or four years later. What happens? Well, childhood leukaemia seems to be linked with affluence, though that influence levels off. It is still rising here, but has levelled off in Sweden, which is more affluent. Also, clusters occur in large new residential areas. New people bring in new bugs, which trigger the abnormal reaction which kicks off the leukaemia.</p> <p><b> 44 Untreated, all cancers will eventually kill</b></p> <p>No. Occasionally, tumours disappear by themselves.</p> <p><b> 45 Survival rates vary across the regions according to wealth</b></p> <p>Yes, for nearly all cancerselves.</p> <p><b> 46 Aspirin stops you getting cancer</b></p> <p>It certainly seems to do something. The CRC is running tests to see if it prevents further polyps in people who have had cancerous colorectal polyps removed. It has also been linked with hindering prostate cancer.</p> <p><b> 47 Expensive anti-cancer drugs are the major part of NHS care costs</b></p> <p>No. The drugs bill is probably around 6 per cent of the total care cost. Most of the money goes on looking after hospitalised patients. Also, though some drugs are very expensive, not all are. Tamoxifen, for example, is out of patent and therefore cheap, just \u00a310 a month. </p> <p><b> 48 I've survived one year, therefore I'll be OK</b></p> <p>It depends on the cancer. Your prospects are modest after a year. They are 'reasonably favourable' after five years, though, for most cancers. Particularly so, according to Trends in Cancer Survival in Scotland, 1971-1995, if you're young and not poor. </p> <p><b> 49 Scientists still don't know what cancer is and how it works</b></p> <p>Wrong. As Dr John Potter said in his keynote address at the AICR annual conference in September, 'In the last decade particularly, our knowledge of the cancer process itself has significantly deepened.' They now have a thorough understanding of what goes inside a cancer cell. Multiple faults in the cell's DNA - at least more than three - are required to turn a normal healthy cell into a cancerous, 'immortal' one. What kicks this process off? Probably things such as radiation and stuff in the food we eat, but the key thing is the general ageing process. Anything particular scientists are paying close attention to? The tumour-suppressor P-53 is thought to be a prime suspect in 50 per cent of cases. Cancer kills because it metastasises - spreads. The 'immortal' cells break off from their original base and migrate through the body, setting up new colonies. Sometimes they base themselves on other organs and stop them working. Other times, the simple alienness of their presence just throws the body's system for a loop, smashing into the immune and endocrine systems, knocking their settings to hell. Too much or too little of the body's regulatory chemicals are released. Patients stop being able to absorb nutrients. So that means scientists have a full understanding of human cancer? Er, no. 'In the laboratory,' adds Dr Potter, 'the cancer process from healthy cell to cancerous tumour is relatively well worked out. In the human body, however, it is much less clear.'</p> <p><b> 50 There's a cure round the corner</b></p> <p>Probably not. Cancer is more than 200 cancers - so a single cure is very unlikely. To mix up the clich\u00e9s, there have been a lot of false dawns and great white hopes. Anti-angiogenesis medications, for example, were big in 1998. Now some say that initial promise has not been fulfilled, though the ICRF disagrees, saying it is 'an exciting area of research'. There are hopes, though. Researchers at Imperial College and the Royal Free Hospital have found stem cells in the bone marrow that can turn into liver cells. The idea would be that a damaged liver could be reconstructed out of new, healthy, cancer-free stem cells. Dr Malcolm Alison of Imperial College says: 'Adult stem cells offer great promise... as they may generate the full spectrum of cell types needed to repair a damaged organ.' Geron Corporation and Duke University have recently come up with the enticing notion of a universal (and patentable) vaccine for cancer, based on the enzyme telomerase, which is found at high levels in tumour cells. Unfortunately for Geron and Duke, it's also found at similar levels elsewhere in the body - bone marrow stem cells, for example. Using it to zap sick cells might also wipe out healthy cells. Another possible advance is making targeted vaccine from the RNA of tumour cells. 'This is quite neat,' says Professor Nick Lemoine of the ICRF, but it's very much a top-dollar option - each patient will have to have a tailor-made vaccine. 'Many oncologists now believe we are entering a golden age of drug discovery,' says the ICRF, pointing to the potential spin-offs from the human genome project. 'I am more sceptical,' says an epidemiologist. 'All genetically engineered drugs are ridiculously expensive, as the biotech companies pay off their investors who took a beating for so many start-up years.'</p> <p>And finally: what do cancer experts have for lunch? On 1 September, at the Renaissance Mayflower Hotel, Washington DC, many of the world's leading experts were gathered for the Tenth Annual Research Conference of the AICR, which focused on 'The role of nutrition in preventing and treating breast and prostate cancer'. Dr Ritva Butrum, an AICR VP, organised the catering for lunch. Chef Norman Wade actually did the cooking. This is what they gave the experts: Grilled tuna ni\u00e7oise; Israeli couscous salad with asparagus and tomato; cucumber salad with onions and tomatoes; wild and brown rice salad; fresh fruit tartlets with low-fat pastry cream. </p> <p>Tuna is high in omega-3 fatty acids - it may fight breast, ovarian and colorectal cancers. The vegetables in the couscous salad are heavy on 'cancer-protective phytochemicals': asparagus has saponins and tomatoes have lycopene - which are linked to reduced prostate cancer risk. Cherries have quercetin, 'an even more potent antioxidant than vitamin E', which actually blocks carcinogens. Strawberries contain both ellagic and ferulic acids. Grapes have flavonoids.

  "In October 1991, the pop charts were awash with cheesy rave anthems based on themes from popular TV shows. Most would be forgotten the moment they spluttered out of the Top 40, but, even at the time, 'Go' seemed different. It was artfully constructed around the looming signature chords from David Lynch's Twin Peaks series, and on Top of the Pops its author threw himself about like a small, white, bald maniac. Soon a disbelieving music press was reporting on this vegan, Christian, teetotal, car-hating New York raver with intense eyes that betrayed such a disquieting mix of challenge and apology. Over the next three years, a string of euphoric hit singles followed. Then things got really strange. <p>Moby's friends will tell you that he lives in the same spartan Manhattan apartment as he did when he made 'Go'. He will tell you that he lives in his tour bus, because when his current travels end in December, he and his party will have been on the road for 21 consecutive months - during which time the material circumstances of his life have altered little, but the context has changed beyond all recognition. When he set out, Moby was considered yesterday's man, a talented musician with a penchant for aggravating others and shooting himself in the foot. When he released his latest album, Play, in May last year, the reviews were grudgingly favourable, but small. The US record labels which had turned him down seemed vindicated: Mute, the British independent which is his real home, watched as Play 'flatlined', shifting a meagre 10,000 copies in six months.</p> <p>A year on, Play has sold more than 5 million, going platinum in 17 countries and topping the charts in seven. Few Britons will get through an entire day without hearing at least one piece of Moby music, as he finds himself re-cast as the world's pop star du jour, a phenomenon he likes to refer to as 'obviously a clerical error'. More peculiar still, we should find this comforting. For his is an extraordinary story.</p> <p>Moby looks fit and fresh, but his mostly Brit crew look worn. 'Did you bring any British newspapers with you?' they ask with a hint of desperation as you're introduced backstage at the soon-to-be-rammed Bronco Bowl in Dallas, Texas. For the past few months, he's been treating his audience to some thoughts on the desirability of voting Al Gore for President, but this is very definitely George W Bush country, and last night in Houston, he forgot. I wonder whether this might have been an unconscious survival instinct, and Moby smiles and leads me to his preferred lair at the rear of his massive bronze bus. I'll be amused to note that he 'forgets' tonight, too.</p> <p>We've met before over the years, and I find him little changed on the surface: the same bald head and alert but strangely neutral features. He's always been good company, talking fast, listening well, engaging in conversation with the whole of his being, ever straining to reach the essence of whatever it is you're talking about, even if it's only tape recorders or socks. He's 35 now and claims to have gradually retreated from his formerly dogmatic approach to life and morality. These days, he even gets pissed sometimes. He's relaxed. He's having fun. I was recently with some musicians who complain bitterly about touring the way he is. I ask how he finds the experience.</p> <p>'I love touring because you never really get bored, and if you do get bored, your circumstances are always changing. Even a lot of the little irritants are addictive. Like, the other day, on our way from Albuquerque to Houston, we had a day off in Wichita Falls, Texas, which is officially the middle of nowhere. So you find yourselves walking through desolate places. And especially out west, America is full of them. There's so much space and so few people. Just standing in a parking lot in the middle of nowhere with a warm breeze blowing. You understand why film-makers are so drawn to making movies about the West - the weird guy sitting behind the counter selling cigars, the old lady on the porch\u0085 I love it.'</p> <p>The name began as a kind of joke, almost from the moment Richard Hall was born. He was so small, so frail, that calling him after the fictional scion of his great-great-great grandfather, Herman Melville, seemed to carry hope, to provide a kind of grand raft for the little boy to cling to. His father, an academic chemist, died in a car crash when his son was two, and his mother, Elizabeth, was a hippy artist who smoked pot and hung out with musicians and struggled, with the help of welfare, food stamps, social security, to make ends meet. Both sets of grandparents were wealthy - mother and son were never going to starve - but in the affluent hamlet of Darien, Connecticut, only 15 minutes distant from the neighbourhood Moby's pal Rick Moody was writing about in his novel/film The Ice Storm, they were apart, other.</p> <p>'The more I travel and see, the more I realise how conventional my upbringing was. But at the time, all my friends seemed to have stable, traditional, affluent homes. Now it turns out that lots of Americans were raised under similar circumstances to me, the difference being that they grew up in communities where everyone had messed-up home lives. I had new clothes, but from bargain shops, not Adidas and Levi's like my peers, and I'm sure a lot of people can relate to the sense of inadequacy that gives you. There was this sense of wanting to fit in and not fitting in, even if it was by no means unique to me. Every time I left the house, I was aware of those feelings.'</p> <p>In retrospect, there were silver linings. The number of pop stars who had hippy parents is high: Beck, PJ Harvey and Jarvis Cocker being but three obvious examples (Moby has noticed this, too). A beardy, bead-wearing friend of Elizabeth's tutored the 13-year-old boy in classical guitar and jazz theory. Through examining his mother's book collection, he came to realise that 'most of the heroes of the 20th century had made a virtue of feeling inadequate or displaced'. He read Rambeau, Faulkner and Bukowski ('not my favourite writer, but\u0085') and felt better. He went to study philosophy at Connecticut University, then transferred to New York, where he was disappointed by the inconsequentiality of the syllabus and directed most of his energy towards music. He played guitar with the punky Vatican Commandos and Flipper before graduating to the briefly wonderful New York psychedelicists Ultra Vivid Scene. Then he left for the visceral joys of rave.</p> <p>He'd picked up his Christianity while at school, but dates the rigidity that came to characterise it from the punk period. He can laugh at it now. 'It lasted till 1996 - from the ages of 16 to 30, basically, which is a long time. First I was a rigid punk-rock Marxist. Then I was a rigid vegan dance-music Christian guy\u0085'</p> <p>And what ended those things, I ask.</p> <p>'Empiricism. Going out and looking at the world and realising that fixed orthodoxies make sense on the printed page and in your head when your eyes are closed and you're going to sleep, but they don't make sense when you walk around and look at the world.' What did he want from the doctrines?</p> <p>'Very simply, what I think motivates people to want to hold on to rigid orthodoxies is the simple desire to see the world as a simple, understandable place. The only epiphany I ever had was being able to say that the world is not a simple and understandable place and people who try to make it so are... jerks. They're unpleasant, and no one wants to hang out with them. They're fundamentalists. That's why the first essay in the Play sleeve is specifically about that. What I found was that people were looking to me to be a rigid vegan fundamentalist or dance fundamentalist or Christian fundamentalist, and I find that to be distasteful.'</p> <p>Is he simply saying that Ewan McGregor won't hang with you if you have convictions? 'No. I think those beliefs and ways of living are erroneous as well. The thing is that I was proved wrong so many times that to try and insist that I know better than everyone else is just stupid.'</p> <p>So the end of ideology has worked for Moby, just like the rest of us. Actually, more than the rest of us. Noticing with humility yet an unmistakable frisson of glee that women fancy famous blokes, he has used the belated realisation that his old semi-celibacy was 'erroneous' as a springboard to discovery. Remembering that when Moby goes for something, he really goes for it, you can't help but feel pleased for him. There was the reported romance with Star Wars actress Natalie Portman, a toe dipped into the world of a dominatrix, the games of 'touch knob' (don't even ask) at celebrity parties, even the tawdry affairs of rock'n'roll legend.</p> <p>His most recent foray into the world of Big Celebrity was attending US R'n'B \u00fcbermeister Sean 'Puffy' Combs's lavish ball in the Hamptons. There's a rare grin on Moby's face as he recounts this.</p> <p>'I went mainly to see what it was like - I mean, that sort of ostentation. So you get there and it's this huge house right on the ocean. And his driveway is filled with Bentleys and Mercedes and Porsches and Jaguars\u0085 it's interesting. I can't judge that kind of consumerism, because I don't come from the same kind of cultural place that he comes from, but it was the weirdest mix. </p> <p>I mean, the Hamptons is horrifying. Really horrifying. It's so much money, so much wealth, so much opulence. You go to these parties and its basically just people figuring out what they can get from each other. </p> <p>'So the interesting thing about Puffy's party is that he wants to be part of that, so he'll go to the Hamptons' invitational polo matches, meaning that half the people at the party were moneyed old conservative WASPs, and the other half were homeboys who he grew up with, people from his record company, Bad Boy. And Salman Rushdie and members of boy bands. And everyone had to wear all white, so it was almost as though you couldn't tell who was who. Leo DiCaprio was turned away because he wasn't wearing white. He had to go buy something! The whole thing was just\u0085 interesting.</p> <p>'What I've come to understand is that indulgence can lead to epiphanies more times that abstinence,' he declares. 'My old quasi-celibacy is a good example. I was celibate for the wrong reasons. I was celibate for the same reasons as I was a vegan and didn't drink - because it made me feel superior.'</p> <p>It seems to me that Moby's being a little hard on himself here. The need to place himself beyond criticism surely stemmed from an underlying feeling that he deserved criticism. I suggest this, but he's having none of it.</p> <p>'Well, I could have been criticised for being a rigid, uptight asshole. And then I found myself suddenly being drunk and occasionally having tawdry one-night stands and affairs. And at times it was wonderful, at times sordid and dumb. But it didn't fit any generalisations, and that was the lesson.'</p> <p>At this juncture, I find myself wondering how Moby defines his Christianity these days. He has a problem with that title, he explains, because he thinks it implies self-righteousness. He became a lover of Christ ('in the Platonic sense,' he giggles) when he came across the Gospel according to Matthew at school, which 'just struck me as right'. Soon, church and Bible studies became a refuge from the alienation he felt elsewhere, fitting neatly into the strictured universe he was trying to construct for himself. In his newly chilled mode, he aspires to live according to the teachings of Christ, he says, adding as a casual rejoinder, 'at least some of them, because unfortunately, I have to be a bit selective'. </p> <p>Intriguingly, Moby's personal and musical evolution has mirrored, and in many respects presaged, developments within British culture during the 90s. Just as political ideology appeared to wither away in those years, so did the tribes and factions that had always defined pop culture. Someone once noted that Britain was the only country in the world where someone might ask, 'So what's he like?' and be told, 'Oh, he's a skinhead.'</p> <p>By the decade's end, the style tribes had dissolved, but when Moby released his debut album, Everything is Wrong, in 1995, minds had not yet been fully prised open. This was a couple of years before the Prodigy, Fatboy Slim or Tony Blair and when Moby, with his outsider's disregard for political or aesthetic correctness, released Everything is Wrong, which veered between swirling club anthems, punk thrashes and ambient torch music, it was met mostly with a mixture of disbelief and consternation. Some excited new listeners were won, but at the expense of fashionability: Moby was ahead of his time. Then, a year later, he tested his audience to destruction with a furious, hardcore punk album, Animal Rights, which very few people bought outside of Greece and Germany. </p> <p>Shortly after its release, his mother was diagnosed with cancer and died in 1998, at the age of 54. A friend has referred to this period as Moby's 'dark night of the soul', and he has wondered at the conjunction of that truculent record and his mother's illness.</p> <p>'You hear stories of farm animals getting jittery and running around before earthquakes,' he says. 'Maybe I was anticipating something.'</p> <p>In the event, what followed bore no relation to what anyone expected. Moby scrapped early sessions for a new album, spooked by the vivid rock/dance crossover success of the Prodigy's Fat of the Land. 'It got very distressing, going to expensive recording studios and continually coming out with results I hated,' he confessed shortly afterwards. 'In the end, I went back to my bedroom and made an album full of flaws, quirks and brilliant idiosyncrasies.'</p> <p>The turning point came when he stumbled across a series of recordings made by a couple of amateur American folk-music archivists named John and Alan Lomax. In the 30s, this father-and-son team had toured the South with a primitive 300lb tape recorder in the boot of their car, recording for posterity the gospel and blues sounds they heard at a time when no one else was. Moby found them inspirational and began to experiment with sampling segments of performance by the likes of the Shining Light Gospel Choir, Boy Blue, Bill Landford &amp; The Landfordaires and Bessie Smith, re-situating them in his modern electronic arrangements. It is tribute to the sensitivity with which he did this that tunes such as the now uniquitous breakthrough single 'Natural Blues' and the rippling 'Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad?' sound as soulful as they do. </p> <p>Interspersed with the usual eclectic and emotive range of his original compositions, they came to form the spine of Play. And that's why we're here.</p> <p>Some people are asking whether Moby has relaxed his standards too much. As Play has grown in popularity, so have allegations that making money out of the mostly impoverished black artists recorded by the Lomaxes amounts to nothing more nor less than exploitation. Moby's heard the arguments and treats the issue gingerly, pointing out that his motives were sound; he never expected Play to be successful and has tried to make sure that the money generated has gone to the right people. He further posits 'collage and assemblage' as 'one of the dominant creative motifs of the 20th century', adding that most of the compositional elements are generated by him. He is right on all counts, but on the plane to Texas, I came across a more sophisticated argument, which could be seen as applying to modern dance music generally.</p> <p>Boiled down to essentials, the American business academic Jeremy Rifkin claims in a new book that the days of the property-based capitalist economy are numbered. Companies such as Nike, he notes, own little other than a concept, a lifestyle, and more and more people are leasing large items like cars in preference to buying. He suggests that in the future we will be purchasing experiences rather than ownership and that this form of exchange will seep into every area of our lives ('We're moving from commodifying goods and services to commodifying culture'). He claims fusion music is a good example of this process: corporations scour the globe for culture to mine, just as their precursors mined copper or coal. In the process, they tear them from their roots. </p> <p>'When you take a culture and homogenise it, transform it, package it and sell it back to people as paid-for experience, then it is just as possible to deplete cultural diversity as bio-diversity,' Rifkin concludes. Dance music has been doing this, or something very like it, for years. Moby comes to terms with the thesis with impressive speed, but takes a moment to work out what he thinks about it.</p> <p>'When I hear people saying stuff like that, I want to sit them down and give them some nice warm soya milk and cookies and tell them everything's going to be OK. I want to tell them, \"Just because we don't fully understand the complexities of the contemporary world doesn't mean that it's wrong or on the brink of collapse.\" You know, this idea that to remove something from its original context is contrary to contemporary life\u0085 everything is removed from its original context.</p> <p>'But I think that, ultimately, culture is democratic. And a lot of supposed academic liberals really have a hard time with that. </p> <p>I remember talking to my aunts and uncles at Christmas a few years ago, and they were complaining about popular music. They said, \"Why can't radio stations play more Bob Dylan and less of that trite, vacuous Britney Spears?\" The answer is because the majority of the people listening to the radio want to hear Britney right now and they don't want to hear Bob Dylan. I mean, I like both of them. </p> <p>'A lot of people imagine conspiracies where conspiracies just don't exist. These big multinational corporations, all they're trying to do is prop up their quarterly share price so they don't get fired. They don't have any agenda apart from staying in business. </p> <p>I think culture is suffering at their hands; the fact that all the record companies have been bought up by a couple of big multinationals\u0085 the music is definitely suffering. 'But you can't judge it from a static perspective. This is the ebb and flow of culture. We have a few years of generic pop music and crummy boy bands and then the next bunch of Nirvanas and Jane Addictions arrive to blow them away.'</p> <p>For his own part, Moby was recently heard lamenting the demise of beauty as an aspiration in art, pointing out that one of the few places where it is still viewed as a valid end-in-itself is within the dance community - 'And a lot of people are not comfortable with that, thinking that it's not intellectually credible. Which is a shame, I think.' With almost the same breath, however, he will question the lack of virtuosity in modern music. Not long ago, he had a haunting vision of George Gershwin being around today and winding up as the guitarist in Creed.</p> <p>'Now we have virtuoso computer programmers and drum programmers and that's wonderful because great records are being made. But I always wonder how many talents are being lost to mediocre records.</p> <p>'Because I do use George Gershwin as an example. He spent his life becoming a phenomenal pianist, learning compositional skills, learning how to write and sheet-read music, and the world is a richer place for it. It's so sad to think of someone who could have been the next Gershwin, or Miles Davis, or Coltrane, instead churning out a couple of mediocre alternative rock records or dance tracks. Because if everyone around you is doing mediocre stuff, you don't really feel the need to push yourself to do any better. At least very few people do. I mean, much as I might applaud democracy in culture, I'm also selfish in that I love memorable, meaningful music - songs that stay with me and that I can listen to and get an emotional reaction to time and again.'</p> <p>Interestingly, Gershwin's 'Rhapsody in Blue' was specifically conceived as a marriage of classical structure with contemporary jazz dance idiom. It was a crossover. Moby has it in mind to make an album in the spirit of Al Green or Bill Withers meeting Massive Attack, but he thinks it might take time to work up to this.</p> <p>A dollar millionaire before the release of Play, mostly on the strength of his remix and film work, even Moby doesn't know what he's worth now. The most controversial portion of his fortune comes from the car ads he has licensed his tunes to. The first time I met him, he wouldn't even step into a car unless he could be convinced that it was a matter of life and death. He is heroically inconsistent and vague on the rationale behind his change of policy, citing flattery, the fact that some of the ads are decent pieces of art and a desire to support his independent record company as factors. He denies that personal gain was a consideration, because he lives an almost distressingly simple life, despite admitting to 'a sybaritic side' that likes nice hotels and flies business class on trips that last more than four hours. It's notable that even the alienated former mates and old enemies will accuse him of stupidity before greed.</p> <p>I ask if he suffers from guilt over money.</p> <p>'To an extent, but I think I deal with it on a very abstract level. Because there isn't really anything I want - at least the things I want are so huge that I could never afford them\u0085'</p> <p>By way of illustrating this point, Moby mentions an island with a huge jet boat with helicopters on the back of it; a menagerie with giraffes and monkeys and koalas (by my reckoning, he could probably afford this one) and a fleet of private planes to fly his friends around the world. Under the circumstances, it doesn't seem so very much to ask.</p> <p>\u0095 <b>Win two VIP tickets</b> to see Moby live in Wembley arena on November 18, with access to an exclusive after-show party where you can meet Moby in person.

  "<p>Shell is on bid alert this weekend after the resumption of \u00a355 billion merger talks between major US rivals Chevron and Texaco. </p> <p>So far the Anglo-Dutch oil giant has stayed aloof from merger mania in the global oil industry, as it carries out a restructuring programme. </p> <p>Texaco, however, has long been seen as an ideal merger mate, and a formal bid by Chevron could spur Shell chairman Mark Moody-Stuart to act, City corporate financiers said. </p> <p>The US oil companies first held merger talks in May last year, only to call the deal off a month later over price and who would gain control. </p> <p>Worth \u00a320bn and trading at a discount to its peers, Texaco is one of the few attractive targets left in the industry. However, an intervention by Shell would lead to fears of closure at the huge Texaco refinery at Milford Haven, the mainstay of the south-west Wales economy. </p> <p>The sector has seen a whirlwind of deals, prompted by the previously low oil price, over recent years. First BP merged with Amoco, then it took over smaller US rival Atlantic Richfield (Arco). Then Exxon swallowed Mobil to reclaim the number one slot. Last year, too, French and Belgian groups Elf and Totalfina merged to create the number four behind Shell. </p> <p>Recently, Chevron was understood to be in exploratory talks with Phillips, a smaller US rival. The main attraction of Texaco , however, is that both are involved in Caltex, a successful refining and petrol station joint venture in Asia Pacific, Africa and the Middle East.</p>",
  "<p>Howard Wilkinson is not just a comedy Yorkshireman or a punchbag for the popular prints, stunning though he is in both those roles in times of national crisis. He also happens to be the FA's technical director - a leading coach acknowledged and respected by most of the European names being bandied about as contenders for the England job - and as such deserves a big say in the debate about who follows Kevin Keegan. </p> <p>As even a little say from Wilkinson tends to be interminable many will be reluctant to grant him this, but there is no point having a technical director if his views on the coaching structure are ignored. Now is the time for the FA either to listen to what Wilkinson has to say, or come clean and admit they only appointed him because the job title sounded trendy. </p> <p>The early signs are that Wilkinson is whistling in the wind. After the uninspiring draw in Finland on Wednesday night, he suggested the two most important requirements for the next England manager were a) availability, and b) a 'deep, deep wish to take on the challenge'. A couple of days later, the FA let it be known that it might be the end of the season before an appointment is made, which immediately suggests two things: first, that 'available' candidates such as Terry Venables are not being considered, and secondly that the manager they have in mind may currently be far more committed to his club. </p> <p>Wilkinson himself falls into the category of 'available', of course, having not yet realised that he will never be taken completely seriously until he has dropped his all too apparent ambition of managing England full-time. There are dozens of reasons why Wilkinson should never manage England again, even in an emergency, from the ludicrous decision that Emile Heskey with a bad back was somehow preferable to the fresh legs of Michael Owen against Finland, to the fiasco of last season's under-21 international at Fulham when thousands of young fans were invited to come to watch Joe Cole only for Wilkinson to keep him on the bench until the second half. More seriously, the ousting of the promising Peter Taylor as under-21 coach now looks an even poorer piece of judgment than it did at the time, especially from a man espousing the need for continuity and a system where junior coaches can be promoted from within. </p> <p>For all these reasons, it is easy to laugh at Wilkinson, and for the past few days that is what his shriller critics have been doing. There was a particular feeding-frenzy when Wilkinson surprisingly admitted it might be necessary to be realistic about 2002 World Cup hopes (ie write them off) in order to get a new team and a coherent system in place for the 2006 event. Surprisingly because those words immediately translated into 'Let's surrender' type headlines, not because his thought process was faulty. </p> <p>This is a point of view that has been put to the past two or three England managers, and Wilkinson deserves credit for being brave enough to admit the truth instead of hiding behind wishful patriotism. </p> <p>When the question was put to Keegan, for instance, his reaction was to turn on the questioner, defend his players, and declare that England would be sending out a team to win Euro 2000. From that point on (a couple of days after the miserable defeat by Scotland in the second leg of the play-off) Keegan's days were numbered. It might be argued such a public statement of belief in his team's ability was motivational or confidence-building, but the effect was simply to pile more pressure on players who already knew they were under-performing. </p> <p>The last thing England need is another manager to arrive and say we have the players to win in Japan and Korea. Because we don't. Results like Wednesday's in Helsinki are not disappointing aberrations, they are the norm. Impressions gathered from the past few days that England are not as good as Germany, about level with Finland and worried about Albania picking up more points are not misleading. England fans know this and many of them would like to see what some of our better young players can do. Foreign coaches, not blinded by the false lustre of the Premiership, have no difficulty perceiving that England managers have to struggle along with hardly any players, which is why so few are beating a path to the FA's door. </p> <p>On the whole it was encouraging to see the FA admit the time might have come for foreign assistance, since that in itself is a huge step towards dismantling our absurdly arrogant world view and placing English football more realistically within the global game, though there are reasons why this may not be the right time to embrace overseas aid. One is that the vast majority of people calling for a foreign coach have in mind one of the outstanding examples already in the Premiership - Sir Alex Ferguson or Ars\u00e8ne Wenger.</p> <p>If either of those two can be prevailed upon to take the job then fine, England will be in good hands. If not, and both men have distanced themselves from the speculation, there is considerably less enthusiasm for the sort of foreign coach who might actually come from abroad and therefore need maybe a season or so to familiarise himself with the language and the location of Premiership grounds. If England want to qualify for 2002 they need a coach, of whatever nationality, who can hit the ground running. If they are going to take Wilkinson's advice and make rebuilding a priority, there are English coaches who can perform the task. 'The perception is that English coaches are nowhere near as good as their French, Dutch and Italian counterparts,' Wilkinson said. 'We have to address that - and the crop of youngsters we have at the moment is a big bonus, and one that reflects well on English coaching.' </p> <p>The second problem with the foreign option is that it is based on the same woolly thinking that got Keegan the job: the dangerous idea that one man with his clipboard, his charisma or his superior grasp of tactics can lead England into the light. One man is not going to change anything. The FA will obviously try to compensate for the Keegan blunder by bringing in a coldly analytical coach with a professorship in tactics, but there seems little point in persuading Sven-Goran Eriksson to leave Lazio, for example, without putting a structure in place to support him. International coaches can only use the players they have, and England's present squad are patently not good enough. </p> <p>Even Venables, on paper the obvious choice, would notice the difference between now and 1996. The foreign invasion of the Premiership only really started after Euro 96, with Chelsea and Middlesbrough leading the way. When Tel was last selecting his England sides, between 1994 and 1996, Blackburn were winning the Premiership with a largely homespun team and Bruce Rioch was manager of Arsenal. Now, apart from David Beckham and Michael Owen, all the top acts are from overseas. Since England's success in Euro 96 gave the Premiership a crucial boost, the domestic league has been unable to return the favour and for some time now its bought-in glamour has persuaded people to overlook our shortcomings at international level. This is not to say Venables should not be given the job - in my view he should have had it since Glenn Hoddle's departure - just to point out it is a trifle simplistic to expect him to snap his fingers and restore normality. </p> <p>The best plan would be to listen to Wilkinson and use the next two or three years wisely. England are already struggling to qualify for 2002 - no one in their right mind imagines we are going to impress anyone even if we get there - so what is there to lose by being realistic? 'We've got to stop this knee-jerk business,' Wilkinson said. 'It doesn't help when coaches come in and make rash boasts, but a lot of them are scared to paint a realistic picture. They would only get panned in the press for being defeatist anyway. There would be a lot of that too if we picked a team for four years ahead and didn't do too well in the intervening competitions, but if it is the right thing to do the press and the public will just have to stand for it. What is the alternative, to just keep riding this roller-coaster and getting nowhere?' </p> <p>This might be the most sensible thing an England manager has said since Bobby Robson confided that Paul Gascoigne was daft as a brush. The managerial succession is not really the issue here. Get a good old 'un, and Robson himself springs to mind, to work with a good young 'un like Taylor or Alan Curbishley, and make the future the priority instead of the present. It is possible to argue that players like Owen and Rio Ferdinand have actually gone backwards since France 98. The FA's first duty is not to find a new manager. It is to make sure the same thing does not happen to Joe Cole, Steve Gerrard, Kieron Dyer, Gareth Barry, Wes Brown and Richard Wright, all of whom should join Beckham, Owen and Ferdinand in the team to face Italy next month.</p>",
  "<p>Those three little words no one wants to hear: you have cancer. The depth of the dread is probably why so many of us know so little about it, preferring to muck around with myths and half-truths. Both my parents had it. My wife is fully recovered from a skin melanoma. One of my best friends survived bowel cancer in his mid-twenties. And still my ignorance was wilfully deep.</p> <p>Nor is it just us civilians who feel that way. \"Even the medical profession hides from the truth,\" the doctor in our family told me. </p> <p>\"I had an old and highly respected Harley Street specialist come to me and say he'd had bleeding from his rectum for some time - what might be wrong? Of course he knew it was colorectal cancer. He just didn't want to know. And when you tell people they have cancer, they ask as few questions as possible.\"</p> <p>So let's tackle the questions we all find so hard to ask - and uncover the truth behind some of our myths.</p> <p><strong> 1 You can catch it just like you catch a cold </strong></p> <p>No, it's not a droplet disease. Nor is it water-borne like, say, cholera. But it's possible to catch diseases and viruses which can lead to it. Around 15% of cancers worldwide are caused this way. Cervical cancer, for example, is virtually always (99.7%) a consequence of HPV, a sexually transmitted infection. Liver cancer is 100 times more likely in hepatitis B victims - which is why it's one of the few cancers where the Third World has a lead over us. The major risk factor is that babies are infected by their mothers. </p> <p><strong> 2 Flying gives you leukaemia</strong></p> <p>Only if you are a long-term commercial pilot - in which case you are five times more likely to get it. The effect is related to the high number of hours flown and only applies to those who have put in more than 5,000 hours. Even serial business flyers like Rupert Murdoch don't rack up hours like that, so it's a purely professional risk. It's most likely caused by cosmic radiation which increases with altitude. So the higher you fly, the more marked the effect - presumably Concorde pilots ran (or flew) the greatest risk. The link was established by Dr Hans Storm of the Institute of Epidemiology, Copenhagen. \"The only way to avoid it,\" he said, \"would be to limit the number of hours pilots are allowed to fly, just as they do with nuclear workers.\" Airline pilots are also three times as likely to get skin cancer, but that's because they take more holidays in the sun.</p> <p><strong> 3 City life gives you cancer</strong></p> <p>No, there is no difference in incidence rate between our towns and our countryside. The same doesn't seem to be true, though, for survival rates. An Aberdeen University study found that rural Scots with stomach cancer were four times more likely to die before it was diagnosed. For breast cancer, it's three times. Why? Because country dwellers have worse access to specialist care than their town cousins.</p> <p><strong> 4 It's man-made chemicals that are to blame</strong></p> <p>Not really. Epidemiologists look elsewhere for the causes, by and large. The BMA estimates that 1 per cent of cancers are caused by food additives. The American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) says no more than 1% of all cancers are a result of man-made chemicals. It's true that a 1999 German report and a more recent one by the US Environmental Protection Agency pointed the finger at dioxins, even coming up with a figure of their being responsible for 12% of human cancers in industrialised countries. Other scientists, while not disputing that dioxins are poisonous, doubt that they are ingested in sufficient quantities and point out that there is no causal link evidence. There is no real evidence of increased cancers in Seveso, site of the worst dioxin exposure and the much-vaunted leukaemia link with water pollution in Worcester, Massachusetts - as recounted in the movie A Civil Action - is almost certainly false. Staggeringly, a majority of US citizens, when polled by the Discovery Channel, said they thought air pollution carried as big a cancer risk as heavy smoking. That's pretty much on a level with thinking the moon's made of green cheese. Still, maybe it's no coincidence. Believing some nasty big business out there is to blame for cancer has two advantages - it stops being your responsibility and, perhaps more importantly in the lawyer-heavy US, it affords you the opportunity to sue the bejaysus out of them. </p> <p><strong> 5 There is more and more and more of it around</strong></p> <p>Well, yes, but this is mostly because more of us live longer. It's overwhelmingly a disease of age - nearly two-thirds of all cancers occur in the over-65s. Also, fewer of us are dying of other diseases - and, death being death, we've all got to die of something. Still, even the age-standardised rates have risen. From 1971 to 1997, levels rose 13% in men and 34% in women. More recently, though, there has been a significant decline in male cancer - down 5.75% since 1994. This is probably because of the long-term drop in lung cancer rates - down 33% from 1986 to 1997. Female cancers, though, have risen a little recently, but they're still below their 1992 peak. In the US, by the way, it's fallen even faster - 10% down overall since the 1992 peak. </p> <p><strong> 6 Every second person seems to have it</strong></p> <p>Almost. In the US, 48% of men and 37% of women will get cancer at some point during their life. The UK figure is a little lower. According to the Imperial Cancer Research Fund (ICRF), just over one in three will get it, one in four will die of it. Currently, the male five-year survival rate is just 31%, while the female is 43%. Five years is the cancer experts' preferred definition of \"survival\".</p> <p><strong> 7 There was some blood in my stools for a bit, but then it stopped, so I haven't got cancer</strong></p> <p>Maybe, maybe not. Cancerous polyps do bleed intermittently. </p> <p><strong> 8 Cervical cancer is a promiscuity thing</strong></p> <p>Afraid so. The younger a woman is when she first has sex and the more sexual partners she has in her lifetime, the greater her chance of getting cervical cancer. That's because it's one of the few cancers caused by something you can catch. More than 99% of women who get it have the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV). Male promiscuity is also a major cause - women who've only had one partner also get HPV. Male promiscuity, combined with lower hygiene levels, is often the problem in the Third World - men catch HPV from prostitutes and infect their wives and lovers. Colombia, for example, has the world's highest rate. There is an HPV test, but trials have had varying results. In some, it's proved accurate. In others, it has produced a number of both false-positives and false-negatives - though the trials weren't large enough to establish whether the numbers were unacceptably large. As recently as September 1999, Dr Peter Sasieni of the ICRF said that adding it routinely \"would certainly lead to greatly increased costs without necessarily significantly decreasing the amount of cancers\". However, both he and the ICRF now believe \"that HPV testing holds great promise as a primary screening method. It has an abnormality detection rate of about 90%, compared with 75 or less for a smear test.\" Currently, it's being tested on borderline cases - still 250,000 a year. Cervical screening is already working. It cut cases by 42% between 1988 and 1997, and deaths have fallen by 50% in the last 15 years.</p> <p><strong> 9 Male circumcision prevents cervical cancer</strong></p> <p>There is some evidence for this. In India, Muslim women have a lower rate of cervical cancer than Hindus and Christians. It certainly seems to prevent penile cancer, which is virtually never seen in circumcised men.</p> <p><strong> 10 I've got genital warts: that means cervical cancer somewhere down the line, right?</strong></p> <p>Almost certainly not. When it comes to cervical cancer, if you can see the problem with the naked eye, it means you haven't got a problem. Nasty but true. More than 60 variants of HPV have been identified. Genital warts are produced by HPV Types 6 and 11, which have no link with cervical cancer. The danger ones are HPV 16, 18, 33, 35 and 45. The big problem is they're mostly \"silent\". Many of us have these HPVs, very few of us know it - a big deal when your chances with cervical cancer are directly related to the disease's progress by the time of diagnosis. Have a pap smear, basically. Because, in the words of the American National Cancer Institute, \"properly treated, tumour control of cervical cancer should be nearly 100%\".</p> <p><strong> 11 Extremely overweight people are more likely to develop it</strong></p> <p>Some American sources say there is a connection between obesity and cancer. The ICRF says the link is not clear. There are two exceptions, though. Obese women are three to five times more likely to get endometrial (lining of the uterus) cancer and obese post-menopausal women run an increased risk of breast cancer.</p> <p><strong> 12 More men die of testicular cancer than women do of breast cancer</strong></p> <p>Not so. Testicular cancer is a very rare disease. It accounts for just one per cent of male cancers - in England and Wales in 1999, 71 died of it, compared with the 11,548 women who died of breast cancer. Incidence has doubled over the last 20 years - though it may now be on the decline since a 1996 peak. It is one of the few cancers that attacks the young. Nine out of 10 cases are in under-55s - and non-descended testicles by the age of seven is a strong indicator for it. The survival rate is excellent, however - almost 95%.</p> <p><strong> 13 OK then, more men die of prostate cancer than women of breast cancer</strong></p> <p>Wrong again, though the figures are a little closer. Breast cancer is the leading killer disease for women between 35 and 54. According to the Office for National Statistics, the lifetime risk is one in nine. Prostate cancer, by contrast, is a one in 14 shot - still 10,000 deaths a year, with a 41% survival rate. Breast cancer survival rates are rapidly improving, though. It kills some 13,000 British women a year, of the 35,000 who develop it. But that is far better than it was. Since the late 80s, when we had one of the lowest survival rates in Europe, deaths have fallen by 30%, faster than anywhere else in the world. That was from a very high starting point, though, so more women are still dying in Britain than in America, Australia and some of Europe.</p> <p><strong> 14 Breast cancer is killing more and more young women</strong></p> <p>Definitely not. Death rates have been reduced by 30% in young and middle-aged victims - mostly because of the efficacy of tamoxifen, a cheap and effective drug which blocks hormone receptors on cancer cells, interfering with their growth. It probably saves more lives than any other form of non-surgical cancer treatment. In younger women, chemotherapy after surgery has made a big difference to death rates.</p> <p><strong> 15 Left-handers are more likely to get breast cancer, so are virgins</strong></p> <p>Yes and yes. The left-hand difference - which is \"modest\" - was reported in the journal Epidemiology. A suggestion is that there is a link to the hypothesis that intrauterine exposure to steroid hormones may play a role in the development of breast cancer, as well as influencing handedness. Virgins are more likely to get it because they don't have children. Breast cancer is closely linked to oestrogen levels. Asian women in Asia, for example, have low levels of both - and British women high ones. Having babies, particularly when you're young, lowers the risk. By contrast, the fewer children you have, the greater your risk. Other risks are late menopause and having a first child after 30 - the older you are, the greater the danger. According to Dr Hilakivi-Clarke of the AICR, it now seems that the impact of high oestrogen levels varies through a woman's life. In the reproductive years, they have no effect at all. In the womb and after menopause, they increase the risk. During childhood, they now appear to play a \"powerful protective role\". </p> <p><strong> 16 Routine mammograms are a waste of time for over-65s</strong></p> <p>No, says the US. Yes, said the ICRF till just the other week - \"There is no good medical reason to justify the decision.\" No, it now says. In the last week of September, the government announced that routine screening would be extended to 65- to 70-year-olds by 2004.</p> <p><strong> 17 I've got a painful lump in my breast, so I must have cancer</strong></p> <p>Most likely not - 90% of breast cancer tumours are not painful, according to a clinician. It is far more likely to be an abscess, which is then always painful.</p> <p><strong> 18 Every man, if he lived long enough, would eventually get prostate cancer</strong></p> <p>Probably. The death toll has doubled over the last 20 years, and in 20 years' time, 50,000 men a year will get it. According to Dr Peter Sasieni, statistician for the ICRF, 40% of all 80-year-old men have it - this was established through post-mortems. Many won't know they've got it, as it develops slowly and they'll die of something else first. \"You can assume that the incidence increases with age. So if men lived to over 120 or so, it is possible they would all get prostate cancer.\" But not necessarily die of it. It looks as if there could well be a form of prostate cancer that just sits there and grows very slowly.</p> <p><strong> 19 The PSA test has transformed the survival rate for prostate cancer</strong></p> <p>The jury's out on this. In the US, prostate cancer deaths have dropped 10% since the early 90s - both experts and patient groups attribute this to the prostate-specific antigen test (PSA) which is a simple blood test. Experts here are nowhere near as convinced, pointing out the test's low accuracy level - it produces an unacceptable number of both false-positives and false-negatives. One of the big problems is figuring out whether a tumour is aggressive or not. New research seems to have pinpointed the eight genes which are responsible for the disease.</p> <p><strong> 20 Black Americans are more likely to get prostate cancer than whites</strong></p> <p> True. No one knows why. </p> <p><strong> 21 There's this Chinese herb stuff which really zaps prostate cancer</strong></p> <p>Absolutely. Western researchers call it PC-SPES. It's an over-the-counter powder supplement with eight different plants in it: isatis, liquorice, lucid ganoderma, pseudo-ginseng, rubescens, saw palmetto and scute. Research is at an early stage, but when rats on PC-SPES were injected with cancer cells, only 60% of them got tumours - compared to the usual 99. Lab tests by Dr Jan Geliebter of New York Medical College further showed that PC-SPES \"strongly inhibits\" the growth of prostate cancer cells in culture.</p> <p><strong> 22 So vegetarians get less cancer</strong></p> <p>No. Eating five portions of fruit and veg a day - whether you're a carnivore, a vegetarian or a vegan - is the thing that could keep Mr C away, or at least make him less likely to come calling. For 20 years, experts have pointed out that red meat and saturated fats are laden with the bad stuff - the chemicals that kick off the process which leads to cancer - while the good stuff is in fruit and vegetables: phytochemicals and antioxidants which fight it. The conclusion propounded was that meat-eating was the problem. Not so. A recent piece of research by the ICRF found that vegetarians are just as likely to die of bowel cancer as meat eaters. Nor was there any difference in breast, prostate, lung or stomach cancer. \"Our analysis suggests that meat itself may have little effect on the development of the disease,\" says the ICRF's Dr Timothy Key - a fairly categorical statement by scientific standards. Another study, by the US National Cancer Institute, found that people on a low-fat, high-fibre diet seemed to stand as much chance of developing pre-cancerous growths in their colons as those who steaked up and burgered out. But it's hard to know what to read into that. Questions are definitely begged. What do pre-cancerous growths, for example, have to say about cancerous ones? And what about cancers outside the colon? Still, a recent AICR expert review of 247 studies found that 78% showed that vegetables and fruit protected against cancer. So best keep having salad with those chips.</p> <p><strong> 23 Garlic beats cancer</strong></p> <p>A recent study-review by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH) suggests that those who regularly eat garlic - raw or cooked - run half the risk of stomach cancer and two-thirds the risk of colon cancer. The AICR recommends eating two to five cloves a week or taking garlic supplements, though the UNC-CH found no benefit in supplements. Why does garlic help? The suggestion is it's because it attacks helicobacter pylori which is closely linked to stomach cancer.</p> <p><strong> 24 Fruit juice stops you getting cancer </strong></p> <p>It probably helps. A glass of juice counts as one portion of the five a day of fruit and vegetables that the WHO and other experts say will lower your risk. For these purposes, by the way, potatoes and nuts don't count as vegetables.</p> <p><strong> 25 Vegans, then. They get less cancer</strong></p> <p>They certainly have lower levels of IGF-I - Insulin-like Growth Factor-I - which increases the risk of prostate cancer. \"Even small differences are predictive,\" says Dr Timothy Key. Low levels are found in places where little meat or dairy products are eaten. An ICRF study revealed that IGF-I levels are 9% lower in vegans than in meat eaters. However, says an epidemiologist, \"studies with big leaps of faith - the technical term is 'proxy outcomes' - from a chemical to a disease don't get me too excited\".</p>",
  "<p><strong> 26 It's like blue eyes or black hair - something you get from your parents</strong></p> <p>Sometimes, yes, but mostly, no. The best evidence comes from a giant twin study - 44,000 pairs of them. Done by the AICR and published in July, it found that even identical twins have only a 10% chance of developing the same cancer. The study estimated that \"60 to 70% of all cancers can be avoided by making small, ongoing changes in what we eat and how we live\". Smoking was said to be the number one cause - 35%. In second place was diet, with 30. The accepted genetic element across all cancers is no more than 10%. Within that figure, though, are three cancers with a strong heritable (the word scientists prefer to genetic) component. The twin study gave prostate at 42%, colorectal at 35, and breast at 27. Although there seems to be general agreement about prostate cancer, other researchers disagree on the heritable level of both colorectal and breast. A common figure given for colorectal is 10, but Colon Cancer Concern gives just 6%. And, according to Professor Alan Ashworth of the Breakthrough Toby Robins Breast Cancer Research Centre, London, only 5 to 10% of breast cancers are familial. These are caused by mutation in the genes BRCA1 and BRCA2. If a woman has either of those, \"it is 85% likely she will develop breast cancer by the age of 70\". </p> <p>What you really want to know, of course, is whether you'll get it. If your parents had cancer, the thing to look out for is if they got it before they were 55 - after that, you're just dealing with the ravages of life. If either parent got colon cancer before they were 55, for example, your odds of getting it are twice what they would have been if your parents had waited until after their 55th birthday - though your odds are still markedly worse than for someone whose parents didn't get it. Even if your family does have a cancer gene, it doesn't mean you're certain to get it. Like blue eyes or colour blindness, it follows the laws of Mendelian genetics What is genetic is your response to drugs. Soon, a simple DNA test - via a finger prick or mouthwash - may make it possible to match the patient to the drug which will be most effective and least unpleasant.</p> <p><strong> 27 Most heavy smokers will die of lung cancer</strong></p> <p>No. According to US figures, a surprising 85 to 90% of the top risk 20/20s (20 or more gaspers a day for 20 or more years) will not get lung cancer, though they'll probably die younger anyway of a stroke or a heart attack. But the fact is that even the link between smoking and lung cancer is not 100%: something else must be going on - probably a combination of genetics and diet. But - and it's an enormous but - lung cancer has a terrifyingly low survival rate, just 5%. It is the third commonest form of death in the UK. Also, according to the CRC, one-third of all cancers are linked to smoking and it's a major factor in at least 12 different ones. The ICRF adds that 90% of all lung cancers are caused by smoking and that 50% of all persistent cigarette smokers will eventually be killed by their habit. Which also means, of course, that 50% won't. Evens ain't great odds, though, is it?</p> <p><strong> 28 Antioxidant supplements accelerate lung cancer in smokers</strong></p> <p>The experts are deeply divided on this. Yes, say a pair of trials conducted by the CRC, which showed betacarotene increasing the risk. Yes, says the AICR. No, says Professor Sir Richard Peto. He points to a third trial conducted over a much longer period which showed no such association. A big study run by a Boston hospital, it involved 22,000 American doctors - half took 50mg doses of betacarotene, half took a placebo. Its conclusion: \"Twelve years of supplementation with betacarotene produced neither benefit nor harm in terms of death from all causes.\"</p> <p><strong> 29 People who smoke only one or two cigarettes a day have nothing to worry about</strong></p> <p>No, but the risk is what scientists call \"linear\". Smoking 20 a day gives you an overall 50% chance of dying from the effect - not just cancers but heart and lung disease, too. Smoking two a day brings that risk down to 5% - still the most dangerous thing smokers do in their lives. Scientists are also sceptical about people's ability to stick to two a day. According to ICRF, smokers who stop in middle age avoid most of their later risk of being killed by tobacco, and those who stop before middle age avoid nearly all the risk. People giving up is the main reason lung cancer is dropping faster here than anywhere else in the world. Are cigars safer? Yes, but only if you don't inhale. Also, you run a higher risk of mouth and throat cancer. Is passive smoking really that dangerous? Officially, yes. The estimate is that it kills 300 a year in the UK - the cancer risk is probably 2% of the active smoking risk. Some researchers are still not convinced, though, about the seriousness of the risk. Dr Ken Denson of the Thame Thrombois and Haemostosis Research Foundation says 10 cigarettes a day is fine, that passive smoking is not a problem but that smokers get lung cancer because of their poor diet. Others say that the Thame Thrombois and Haemostosis Research Foundation is a tobacco industry apologist.</p> <p><strong> 30 I've got a cough, therefore I haven't got lung cancer</strong></p> <p>Er, no. A cough occurs in 80% of lung cancers. </p> <p><strong> 31 Not all lung cancer is caused by smoking</strong></p> <p>True. According to the ICRF, one in 20 UK cases is caused by radon, the natural gas which leaks up from the earth, particularly in the West Country, and accumulates in houses. However, says an epidemiologist, these \"findings are just at the border or what can be detected in epidemiologic studies. It's actually a pretty small number of lung cancers, particularly in non-smokers.\"</p> <p><strong> 32 Infertility treatment increases your risk of ovarian cancer</strong></p> <p>Sadly, probably so. Basically, it seems that the more eggs a woman produces, the higher her risk. So pregnancy and the pill both reduce that risk, while women who start menstruating early and finish late face an increased chance of getting it. It's as if, over millions of years, women developed reproductive systems that were balanced around their reality of their lives - late puberty because of bad diet, followed by lots of pregnancies (if not always live children) and then an early death. Modern life not being like that, the system is out of whack - and prone to cancer.</p> <p><strong> 33 You're more likely to die of it here than in Europe or the US</strong></p> <p>True - probably. Cancer researchers are wary of making direct comparisons, but there does seem to be a clear difference. The best comparison is what statisticians call \"age-standardised death rates per million\" - that means there is no bias against countries with an ageing population. According to the ONS, for England and Wales, a male figure of 2,674 is slightly worse than Europe's 2,432. When it comes to women, though, the difference is startling - 2,464 to 1,672. It's also widely accepted that our overall survival rate is 40%, compared with some of Europe's 50%. In the US, 60% of patients now survive at least five years. For colorectal cancer, the UK survival rate is around 40%, compared with Europe's 45 and 60 in the US.</p> <p><strong> 34 Loads of children get it and they invariably die</strong></p> <p>Not at all. Cancer is overwhelmingly a disease of age. Look at the very latest figures, in the autumn 2000 edition of Health Statistics Quarterly. The peak for both men and women comes at 70 to 74 years of age. Just 5% of male cancers and 9% of female cancers occur in under-45s. And children? Under-15s account for just 0.6% of all cancers - though that's still 1,200 to 1,300 cases a year. A third of those are leukaemia (which is not particularly heritable, by the way) but even there the outlook is neither as it was nor as bleak as people think. Improved chemo routines and refinement of bone-marrow transplants have cut childhood leukaemia deaths by 57% in the US and 50% here. The UK recovery rate for childhood cancers is 60% overall, 90% for some. That's why there are 18,000 survivors out there. On the other hand, it's still the most common cause of death from illness in children.</p> <p><strong> 35 Only humans get it</strong></p> <p>Not true. Domestic and farm animals and birds and fish all get it. Wild animals? Mostly, no. They don't live long enough to get it - because they don't have the antibiotics and medical care we give to our pets and prospective dinners. Recent US research, though, suggests those other top-of-the-food-chainers, sharks, do get it.</p> <p><strong> 36 You can get it from the barbie</strong></p> <p>Maybe, but unlikely. The blackened crust on a piece of BBQed meat or fish contains heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAAs), which are certainly carcinogenic. The same applies to grilling and frying in very hot oil. In fact, no one has actually been able to implicate barbecuing in cancers. Also, according to the ICRF, lab tests that showed the DNA damage, which is central to the cancer process, used much higher doses of the chemicals than humans consume - though it still recommends not eating large quantities of charred food. The AICR also issues an annual warning at the start of the summer grilling season. It recommends avoiding charred food and eating grilled meat and fish only occasionally. If you must, it advises using lean meat (bye bye ribs, so long bangers), cutting the fat and skin off, removing any charred sections and using tongs - puncturing the surface allows fat to drip down and cause flame-ups, which produce another kind of carcinogen, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). However - and it's a big, happy however - you can cut the risk by marinating the meat or fish. Lab tests produced a 99% reduction in HCA and even brief baths in the marinade \"produced significant reductions\". Why? Scientists guess it's because typical marinade ingredients - vinegar, citrus juice, herbs, spices, olive oil - are famously full of the anti-cancer good stuff. Would that then mean that barbied fruit and veg aren't a problem? It would. They pose no known health risk, according to AICR director of nutrition education, Melanie Polk. \"And if you're looking for an exciting but healthy summertime dessert, try grilled fruit. The grill's heat caramelises the fruit's sugar and lends a more intense and deliciously sweet flavour.\"</p> <p><strong> 37 Scotland is the cancer capital of the world</strong></p> <p>There's some truth in that. Scottish cancer rates have been steadily increasing for years, particularly among poor men. The guess is that they are slower in seeing a doctor - and early diagnosis is closely linked to survival. The Scottish Cancer Intelligence Unit made international comparisons, with the US and a range of European countries, including England and Wales (still a unit, as far as statisticians are concerned). It reported: \"In both sexes, incidence and mortality rates were among the highest, whereas survival was the lowest.\" Though perhaps no worse than England and Wales, according to the report.</p> <p><strong> 38 High-earning whites are more likely to get testicular cancer than black men</strong></p> <p>Odd but true, according to the CRC.</p> <p><strong> 39 Cancer is caused by stress</strong></p> <p>Doesn't seem so. There is, however, some evidence that stress may trigger relapses. A late-80s study by Professor Amanda Ramirez of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund Psychosocial Oncology Group compared female breast cancer victims who'd had a relapse with those who hadn't. Those who got it again were significantly more likely to have suffered traumatic life events - divorce, bereavement, bankruptcy, etc. Professor Ramirez thinks any potential link here is hormonal - oestrogen levels in the case of breast cancer. </p> <p><strong> 40 Too many kippers will give you stomach cancer</strong></p> <p>Yes and no. While it's true that there is an established link between stomach cancer and a diet heavy in smoked and/or pickled foods, you have to eat them in quite un-British quantities. \"The cause of the association is not clear, however,\" said David Forman, professor of cancer epidemiology at the University of Leeds and honorary consultant to the ICRF. \"Preserved foods of this kind are often consumed as part of a poor diet, deficient in fresh fruit and veg. So it is unclear whether it is something in the smoked/pickled foods themselves or the lack of fresh food - or both - which increases the risk.\" The classic example is Japan, where even now they don't eat much fruit and veg. Stomach cancer is closely linked to the bacterium Helicobacter pylori - according to an international study led by Dr David Forman, those infected are six times more likely to develop it.</p> <p><strong> 41 The sun gives you skin cancer</strong></p> <p>Ish. The fairness of your skin is the crucial factor. The paler it is, the greater the risk. The highest incidence of melanomas is in Queensland, Australia, the lowest is in Bombay - not exactly a sun-free spot. </p> <p><strong> 42 Selenium protects against cancer, and therefore I should take it as a supplement</strong></p> <p>Respectively, yes and no. Selenium does seem to help with lung, colon, oesophagal and prostate cancers - heart disease, too. \"It's a potent antioxidant which can block cell DNA damage,\" says Dr Peter E Newburger of the University of Massachusetts Medical School. It helps the enzymes which break down the free radicals that damage cells. But you almost certainly already get enough selenium in your diet - 55 micrograms a day for women, 70 for men. Too much can have serious side effects, from nausea up to cirrhosis of the liver. \"It's toxic when taken at high levels,\" says Dr Newburger. \"This is not a case of: if a little is good, a lot is better.\"</p> <p><strong> 43 Children who live near nuclear power plants get more cancer</strong></p> <p>Probably not. Despite extensive and continuing investigations of links between childhood cancers and nuclear installations, no clear clear risk difference has yet been established. Childhood leukaemia is caused by a mix of genetics and environment, it seems. A child is born with leukaemic cells but doesn't develop the disease until three or four years later. What happens? Well, childhood leukaemia seems to be linked with affluence, though that influence levels off. It is still rising here, but has levelled off in Sweden, which is more affluent. Also, clusters occur in large new residential areas. New people bring in new bugs, which trigger the abnormal reaction which kicks off the leukaemia.</p> <p><strong> 44 Untreated, all cancers will eventually kill</strong></p> <p>No. Occasionally, tumours disappear by themselves.</p> <p><strong> 45 Survival rates vary across the regions according to wealth</strong></p> <p>Yes, for nearly all cancers.</p> <p><strong> 46 Aspirin stops you getting cancer</strong></p> <p>It certainly seems to do something. The CRC is running tests to see if it prevents further polyps in people who have had cancerous colorectal polyps removed. It has also been linked with hindering prostate cancer.</p> <p><strong> 47 Expensive anti-cancer drugs are the major part of NHS care costs</strong></p> <p>No. The drugs bill is probably around 6% of the total care cost. Most of the money goes on looking after hospitalised patients. Also, though some drugs are very expensive, not all are. Tamoxifen, for example, is out of patent and therefore cheap, just \u00a310 a month. </p> <p><strong> 48 I've survived one year, therefore I'll be OK</strong></p> <p>It depends on the cancer. Your prospects are modest after a year. They are \"reasonably favourable\" after five years, though, for most cancers. Particularly so, according to Trends in Cancer Survival in Scotland, 1971-1995, if you're young and not poor. </p> <p><strong> 49 Scientists still don't know what cancer is and how it works</strong></p> <p>Wrong. As Dr John Potter said in his keynote address at the AICR annual conference in September: \"In the last decade particularly, our knowledge of the cancer process itself has significantly deepened.\" They now have a thorough understanding of what goes inside a cancer cell. Multiple faults in the cell's DNA - at least more than three - are required to turn a normal healthy cell into a cancerous, \"immortal\" one. What kicks this process off? Probably things such as radiation and stuff in the food we eat, but the key thing is the general ageing process. Anything particular scientists are paying close attention to? The tumour-suppressor P-53 is thought to be a prime suspect in 50% of cases. Cancer kills because it metastasises - spreads. The \"immortal\" cells break off from their original base and migrate through the body, setting up new colonies. Sometimes they base themselves on other organs and stop them working. Other times, the simple alienness of their presence just throws the body's system for a loop, smashing into the immune and endocrine systems, knocking their settings to hell. Too much or too little of the body's regulatory chemicals are released. Patients stop being able to absorb nutrients. So that means scientists have a full understanding of human cancer? Er, no. 2In the laboratory,\" added Dr Potter, \"the cancer process from healthy cell to cancerous tumour is relatively well worked out. In the human body, however, it is much less clear.\"</p> <p><strong> 50 There's a cure round the corner</strong></p> <p>Probably not. Cancer is more than 200 cancers - so a single cure is very unlikely. To mix up the clich\u00e9s, there have been a lot of false dawns and great white hopes. Anti-angiogenesis medications, for example, were big in 1998. Now some say that initial promise has not been fulfilled, though the ICRF disagrees, saying it is \"an exciting area of research\". There are hopes, though. Researchers at Imperial College and the Royal Free Hospital have found stem cells in the bone marrow that can turn into liver cells. The idea would be that a damaged liver could be reconstructed out of new, healthy, cancer-free stem cells. Dr Malcolm Alison of Imperial College said: \"Adult stem cells offer great promise... as they may generate the full spectrum of cell types needed to repair a damaged organ.\" Geron Corporation and Duke University have recently come up with the enticing notion of a universal (and patentable) vaccine for cancer, based on the enzyme telomerase, which is found at high levels in tumour cells. Unfortunately for Geron and Duke, it's also found at similar levels elsewhere in the body - bone marrow stem cells, for example. Using it to zap sick cells might also wipe out healthy cells. Another possible advance is making targeted vaccine from the RNA of tumour cells. \"This is quite neat,\" said Professor Nick Lemoine of the ICRF, but it's very much a top-dollar option - each patient will have to have a tailor-made vaccine. \"Many oncologists now believe we are entering a golden age of drug discovery,\" said the ICRF, pointing to the potential spin-offs from the human genome project. \"I am more sceptical,\" said an epidemiologist. \"All genetically engineered drugs are ridiculously expensive, as the biotech companies pay off their investors who took a beating for so many start-up years.\"</p> <p>And finally: what do cancer experts have for lunch? On 1 September, at the Renaissance Mayflower Hotel, Washington DC, many of the world's leading experts were gathered for the Tenth Annual Research Conference of the AICR, which focused on the role of nutrition in preventing and treating breast and prostate cancer. Dr Ritva Butrum, an AICR VP, organised the catering for lunch. Chef Norman Wade actually did the cooking. This is what they gave the experts: Grilled tuna ni\u00e7oise; Israeli couscous salad with asparagus and tomato; cucumber salad with onions and tomatoes; wild and brown rice salad; fresh fruit tartlets with low-fat pastry cream. </p> <p>Tuna is high in omega-3 fatty acids - it may fight breast, ovarian and colorectal cancers. The vegetables in the couscous salad are heavy on \"cancer-protective phytochemicals\": asparagus has saponins and tomatoes have lycopene - which are linked to reduced prostate cancer risk. Cherries have quercetin, \"an even more potent antioxidant than vitamin E\", which actually blocks carcinogens. Strawberries contain both ellagic and ferulic acids. Grapes have flavonoids. \"We successfully combined science savvy with gourmet quality,\" said Dr Butrum.</p> <p>\u0095 Sources: information and answers provided by Imperial Cancer Research Fund; American Institute of Cancer Research; National Institute of Health (US); Cancer Research Campaign; Colon Cancer Concern; Bacup; Breast Cancer Awareness; Scottish Cancer Intelligence Unit; National Cancer Institute (US); General Clinical Research Center (US); BMJ; New England Journal of Medicine; American Journal of Clinical Nutrition; Office for National Statistics, Information and Statistics Division, Scotland; Northern Ireland Cancer Registry; Dr Paul Brass; Dr Nigel Paneth</p>",
  "<p><strong>Hitler 1936-45: Nemesis</strong><br>Ian Kershaw<br>Allen-Lane \u00a325, pp1,168<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,501025482,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>More than a political phenomenon, Hitler is a psychological and moral enigma. How did an idle, talentless, disgruntled wastrel come to terrorise a continent? And what self-destructiveness in human nature begot this nihilist who was gleefully able to sentence millions of his men to death because he considered mankind to be nothing more than a grubby and imperfect 'cosmic bacterium'? </p> <p>The scale of the damage Hitler did - to his victims, to the world, and to our self-esteem as a species - makes us liable to aggrandise him. His followers thought of him as a divine being, a non-Christian saviour and redeemer; to his enemies, he was the devil incarnate, a Mephistophelean sorcerer. He complacently likened himself to Wagner's war-mongering gods, or to the elemental energies of romantic nature. Before the Anschluss, he promised to erupt in the sky above Vienna 'like a spring storm'. </p> <p>Ian Kershaw, in his two-volume biography, seems at first to share this tendency to treat Hitler's life as a Heldenleben. Behind the bullying, the thuggery, the ranting, the outright mania and the episodes of obscene savagery, like his revenge on the von Stauffenberg plotters, Kershaw discerns the trajectory of the classical tragic hero. This is why he has taken his subtitles from Aristotle. The first volume was about Hitler's hubris - that sublime arrogance which prompted Agamemnon to step on the red carpet. Now follows nemesis, the downfall decreed for all such proud over-reachers.</p> <p>In effect, it's not much more than a structural conceit. Nemesis needs a god of unchallenged power to enforce it, and just who decreed Hitler's defeat? In the telling, Kershaw's story turns out to be much less cloudily supernatural, with no presiding metaphysical justice. Hitler survived as long as he did thanks to luck, and to the succession of minute mischances which baffled a series of would-be assassins. He made up military strategy as he went along and may have lost the war because of muddled tactics: if the Germans had reacted more swiftly on the Normandy beaches, Kershaw reckons, they might have beaten back the Allied invasion. </p> <p>This was no apocalyptic combat between good and evil. After all, as Hannah Arendt pointed out after listening to the shabby, incoherent testimony of Eichmann at his trial in Jerusalem, the Nazis deprived evil of its infernal allure and made it banal, bureaucratic, officious. </p> <p>Kershaw's Hitler is therefore mediocre, not monstrous, a blundering amateur rather than the malevolent genius of Thomas Mann's Doctor Faustus or Klaus Mann's Mephisto. With his braggatry and his tantrums, Kershaw finds him pitiably infantile, 'the spoilt child turned into the would-be macho man'.</p> <p>Along with a capacity to unleash violence on a global scale, he possessed faults which were only too shamingly ordinary. He was vain, and because he refused to wear spectacles, he insisted that memoranda should be printed out in banner headlines which required the invention of a 'F\u00fchrer typewriter' with preposterously over-sized keys. He was lazy, with little patience for detailed planning, hence the reckless, ludic reliance on improvisation which made him provoke the Czech crisis in 1938. He absented himself from Berlin during the war and preferred to brood on his aquiline perch in the mountains above Salzburg. Above all, he was boring, to the point of stupefaction for those courtiers who had to sit through his all-night rigmaroles and chuckle at his sadistic whimsies in the bleary dawn. </p> <p>Despite Hitler's phobias and his carpet-biting hysterics when crossed, Kershaw refuses to declare him clinically insane. That would be an easy way out. If arraigned in an American court today, he might claim an extenuating addiction to prescribed medicines and blame the quacks who dosed him with anti-gas pills containing strychnine and belladonna, ophthalmic drops laced with cocaine and the smorgasbord of several dozen assorted tablets that he gobbled every day. It's a wonder that his arteriosclerosis, or the Parkinson's disease which involuntarily agitated his limbs, didn't make a premature end of him. </p> <p>So how did this puffed-up pub orator, virtually indistinguishable from Chaplin's caricature of him in The Great Dictator, acquire such absolute dominance of a modern, supposedly civilised state? Hitler had no ideas beyond a rabid hatred of Bolsheviks, though even this maniacal crusade was compromised when he signed his non-aggression pact with Stalin (and he soon contradicted his own contradiction by turning on Russia). His ideology was a farrago of mythical nonsense. But he understood publicity and propaganda, which can augment the individual's power by magnifying his image and making him omnipresent.</p> <p>The radio took his harangues into every German household and ensured that all his subjects were attuned to the frenzies he incited. Rehearsing his speeches in front of a mirror in order to fine-tune his gesticulation, he was the first politician for whom performance mattered more than policy. After him come Reagan, folksily ingratiating rather than nightmarish, or Tony Blair with his play-acted air of commiseration whenever a son keels over drunk in public. At least we are now merely force-fed soundbites instead of having to listen to tirades like those at the Nuremberg rallies, which lasted an average of two hours. </p> <p>Kershaw has written two huge books about Hitler. But the man inside them is dismayingly small - a hollow, self-deluding fantasist. At the end of Nemesis, we watch him decompose. A guard in the Chancellery garden nudged Hitler's incinerated corpse with his boot and it collapsed into ashes. A dental bridge was picked out of the grimy debris for purposes of identification; the rest of the F\u00fchrer, who considered himself the greatest man in history, was scooped up and sifted into a cigar box.</p> <p>Hitler has always been terrifying, but Kershaw makes him more intimately repellent. During the seizure of Poland, the Swedish industrialist Birger Dahlerus found him in a nervous funk: 'The odour from his mouth was so strong that Dahlerus was tempted to move back a step or two.' Instead of the stench of brimstone from the pit, Kershaw's Hitler exudes halitosis. It's a useful and vindictive reminder that he too, like the fellow beings he excoriated as subhuman and set out to exterminate, was little better than a bacillus.</p>",
  "<p>The Kent town of Maidstone was back on flood alert yesterday as high tide on the Medway met floodwaters coursing down the waterway. </p> <p>Water levels had dropped as the weather improved, according to the Environment Agency, but the tide added about 2ft to the swollen river. 'I think it was pretty close,' said a spokeswoman for the agency, as the river lapped the parapet of the bridge over it. </p> <p>Twelve severe flood warnings remain in force in Kent and East Sussex with large areas under water, including around 500 homes in Sussex. Dozens of families were in emergency accommodation last night in Kent as the clean-up began following the worst floods for 40 years. </p> <p>The devastation of homes and businesses prompted the Government to promise a clampdown on new building in low-lying areas, while mortgage lenders warned that concern about flooding could cut house prices. </p> <p>In Yalding, on the Medway, homes were still under up to 6ft of water yesterday. Kent Fire Brigade divisional officer Andy Merriman said: 'Yalding is still very badly flooded. The catastrophic flooding of Maidstone that was feared did not happen but there is severe flooding in the town.' In Lewes, East Sussex, pumping was under way after the Ouse burst its banks on Wednesday. </p> <p>The total clean-up bill has been put at \u00a32 billion by one insurance firm. The Government promises to deal quickly with financial help demanded by councils. </p> <p>Families who had spent the previous night in emergency accommodation started returning to their homes yesterday. However, a spokesman for Maidstone council warned: 'People should only return home on police advice - and that's after the electricity, gas and water have cleared it.' Last night, around 50 people were still unable to return home. </p> <p>Visiting the devastated areas in Kent, the coastal and flood defences Minister Elliot Morley said the Government would clamp down on new development in flood-prone areas. The Environment Agency has been pressing for a change to the planning laws to take into account global warming. It forecasts that floods that were previously expected once in 100 years are set to become once-in-10-year events because of disruption to weather patterns and rising sea levels. </p> <p>Morley promised that, under new guidance to be issued in December, local councils and the Environment Agency would be given more powers to stop development on flood plains. The new planning policy was being drawn up in advance of more than four million homes being built across the South within the next 20 years. </p> <p>The Environment Agency now has no power to prevent building in prone areas, and can only advise against it. Morley said: 'We can never say there should never be any development on flood plains but such development must be appropriate.' </p> <p>The new planning rules will insist there must be 'sustainable drainage' so that water drains straight down into the ground rather than running along the surface. </p> <p>Archie Robertson, the Environment Agency's director of operations, said no more development should be allowed on flood plains in areas such as Yalding: 'It was a lack of scientific understanding that saw villages like Yalding built where they are hundreds of years ago.' </p> <p>The Association of British Insurers has warned premiums might rise for houses in high-risk areas, and that some houses could be uninsurable as a result of regular flood damage. </p> <p>Adrian Coles, director-general of the Building Societies Association, said: 'Buyers considering buying in those areas may now think there is too big a risk of flooding, saying they're not prepared to pay so much. The price could go down - it's simple supply and demand.' </p> <p>Friends of the Earth warned price falls could be exacerbated by local authorities updating their advice on flood risk when buyers do a legal search on a property. </p> <p>Roger Higman, senior climate changer campaigner, welcomed the clampdown on building in flood-prone areas, but said more must be done to combat causes of global warming. 'Perhaps those angry about high fuel prices should think that more of this sort of devastation could be the consequence of low fuel prices,' he said. </p> <p>Next month governments will meet in The Hague to decide how meet their targets to reduce greenhouse emissions. The US wants to meet its target without taking much further action, such as raising tax on fuel or encouraging conservation of energy. </p> <p>\u0095 anthony.browne@observer.co.uk</p>",
  "Not one of the 100-plus recommendations in the Runnymede Trust's report on The Future of Multi-Ethnic Britain attracted media comment last week. Instead, the report was swamped by a tide of criticism. It was said to have argued that 'to be British is racist' and that therefore the term 'Britain' should be 'consigned to the dustbin of history'. <p>It would indeed be presumptuous to propose writing Britain out of history and, in fact, the report did no such thing. We did say that, historically, the idea of Britishness carried 'largely unspoken racial connotations' - meaning that, in common understanding, the nation is usually imagined as white. Given the history of these islands, this seemed to us an incontrovertible statement of fact. Perhaps unwisely, the report expected journalists to understand the distinction between 'racial' (as in a 'racial group') and 'racist' (as in 'a racist group'). </p> <p>We nowhere suggested that this was destined to remain so until the end of time. Indeed, we acknowledged that ideas of national belonging change, that new versions are emerging. Growing inclusiveness is already one positive result of the increasingly multicultural character of society. However, we were not prepared to say that the process had gone far enough and that everyone now felt equally included since, as the many direct quotations in the report show, this is manifestly not the case. </p> <p>That great patriot Enoch Powell once remarked that 'the life of nations is lived largely in the imagination'. It is worth continuing to ask the awkward question, how is the nation imagined? What pops into the mind's eye, when people say 'Britain' or 'British'? By now, few people can imagine the British Olympic team without a black face. On the other hand, during the recent celebration of 'Britain's Finest Hour', it was not the faces of Asian and Caribbean World War II volunteers which automatically first came to mind. Where were they in the fly-past? </p> <p>Far from suggesting that 'British' be dropped, we described the growing tendency for ethnic minority people to identify themselves as Black-British or British-Asian as a positive sign of their 'claim to belong'. But belonging is a tricky concept, requiring both identification and recognition. If people from ethnic minorities are to become not only citizens with equal rights but also an integral part of the national culture, then the meanings of the term 'British' will have to become more inclusive of their experiences, values and aspirations. Otherwise Britain will be a multi-ethnic, mono-cultural society, which is a contradiction in terms. The binding function of national identity only works if individuals can somehow see themselves reflected in the culture. Otherwise, they may feel British, but will not be publicly recognised to be so. Since the routes by which the minorities have travelled to this identity are different in some crucial respects from that taken by native people, they are unlikely to feel 'British' in exactly the same way. That is why the hyphen - Black-British, British-Asian - persists. Does the idea of 'Britishness' have room to accommodate these differences? </p> <p>It is really a visceral objection to this very question that motivated the torrent of misquotation and abuse. At times this week I longed to hear how this debate would be conducted in Edinburgh or Cardiff, let alone Haringey or Moss Side. Britain always was and really is now a nation of nations. It cannot continue to conflate 'Englishness' with 'Britishness'. Some commentators really do suppose that Britain will obliterate all trace of its imperial history, devolve government, integrate with the global economy, play an active role in Europe, treat all minority peoples as equal citizens - and retain its self-understanding intact since Magna Carta! This is not serious analysis, it is cloud-cuckoo land. </p> <p>As the coincidence of the Windrush celebrations and the Stephen Lawrence Inquiry showed, it is perfectly possible for multiculturalism and racism to coexist. The country is divided into three rough groups. Some think that Britain's multicultural character gives vibrancy and cultural energy to life and wouldn't have it any other way. Others tolerate 'multicultural drift', but are not passionately committed to it and hope, if they keep out of the great urban areas, it will leave them alone. Others are passionately hostile to the idea and feel threatened and culturally undermined by it. A minority of these are prepared to stick knives into it or set it alight when they encounter it on the streets. </p> <p>Only deep and rigorous measures to end discrimination can help us navigate these treacherous waters. I regret that the report's many important proposals were temporarily eclipsed by the debate about 'Britishness' but I don't regret the debate about identity has been engaged. </p> <p>\u0095 Stuart Hall was a Runnymede report commissioner.</p> <p>\u0095 Useful link: <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/racism/\">Special report: race issues in the UK</a></p>",
  "To me, 'Britishness' is merely the signifier of the place I come from. It's certainly not a word that implies racism. Indeed, the suggestion in last week's Runnymede Trust report that 'Britishness' connotes racism is absurd, an attempt to wring a mea culpa from guilty liberals and nothing to do with advancing racial unity and equality. <p>I can understand how the writers of this report arrived at their conclusions. Until recently, non-white communities were too small to have made any impact on national identity; to be 'British' was to be white. Quite recently, Britishness also carried the racist connotations of the British Empire. Being British was to belong to a superior ruling nationality. But the trust is wrong to conclude this association is so strong it is the 'dominant imagining' of Britishness. </p> <p>The trust criticises Britishness in the context of preparing us for a more heterogeneous notion of nationhood. It claims globalisation and increasing immigration make this inevitable. It doesn't exactly say we shouldn't use 'British' anymore, but suggests ways of diluting it: Britain should be reconceived as 'community of communities'. The first step would be to 'formally declare that Britain is a multicultural society'. </p> <p>What on earth is the point of such declarations? The UK is already a society of many cultures. Such a declaration would be an assertion of what the trust wants us to sign up to, representing a wish that 'multiculturalism' be recognised as the UK's base-line ideology. Yet multiculturalism is not an innocent term, neutrally implying that races and cultures cohabit together. It also implies the absence of any dominant sense of a shared culture. It implies a country which contains diversity in a non-partisan way, in which all cultures, faiths and creeds have equal status. </p> <p>This 'multiculturalism' is riddled with problems, and it is not racist to think so. Britishness has many positive as well as negative connotations: commitment to democracy, justice, moderation. Many are attached to upholding its traditions and particularity, including the numerous black British who ridiculed the report's critique of Britishness. </p> <p>Some of the leading black thinkers involved in the report have previously attacked the idea as cultural relativism which undermines shared political and community values, especially among disenfranchised white Britons. 'British multiculturalism,' says one truster, 'imposes what I would call an impossible demand. That is the demand for equality and difference.' Yasmin Alibhai-Brown says multiculturalism has 'made it too difficult for black and Asian Britons to have rich, multiple identities'. </p> <p>In the past, they have called for a new, culturally-inclusive approach, emphasising 'citizenship' and 'civic duty' rather than the laissez-faire 'multiculturalism'. They have talked of the need to thrash out a consensual space, in which the values of a liberal democracy are preserved while recognising the specific needs of marginalised groups. They also talk of the need for all groups to feel they have a stake in, and belong to, the locality or country in which they live. </p> <p>The fact that Alibhai-Brown and Hall were part of the trust only underlines the enormous difficulty of establishing a practical politics based on this position. But their critique of multiculturalism is important. The extreme Right is gaining ground in Europe, even in erstwhile liberal countries such as Belgium and Norway. It flourishes on the back of racist propaganda about the dilution of cultural distinctiveness, even in Belgium. It's easy to denounce those involved, much harder to analyse them. Yet one element is clear. A multicultural vortex frightens some people; they can't see how to preserve a stable society, and the values and traditions of 'their' culture in the face of rampant globalisation and a multicultural free-for-all. </p> <p>There is nothing wrong with feelings of belonging as long as this doesn't turn to chauvinism or bigotry. Both Hall and Alibhai-Brown recognise this when they talk about the importance of locality in the global m\u00eal\u00e9e. When so little unites people, place becomes more important. This does not have to be a mystical notion of 'fatherland' but a notion of a valued place, whose customs have heterogeneous origins, but which inspires affection and a sense of belonging. </p> <p>The missing link here is to environmental politics. If place becomes the key to politics in a heterogenous society, then it becomes critical to look after it. That's another reason to contest declarations of a multicultural UK. </p> <p>Right now, other political priorities also have claims. Why not formally declare Britain 'a green and pleasant land'? It isn't. But it is vital to nurture the place people want to belong to, whatever their race or creed. This is a far better way to encourage a shared stake in the future rather than making everyone feel dislocated.</p>",
  "A former hardliner turned reformer becomes increasingly isolated within his community. Across the divide a greying ex-guerrilla leader now peacemaker reverts to revolutionary rhetoric to head off radicals wanting to resume war. Meanwhile an old warhorse struts back on to the political landscape confident that his scepticism about peace is going to be justified. An American President who invested so much personal credibility in the process looks on aghast as his finest hour in foreign affairs crumbles. <p>Interchange the names of Ehud Barak and David Trimble; substitute Yasser Arafat for Gerry Adams; replace Ariel Sharon for Ian Paisley and you can draw disturbing parallels between the Middle East and Northern Ireland's floundering political accord. </p> <p>In terms of scale the violence in the Middle East is infinitely more dangerous than Ireland's fragile peace. The stability of the entire region is threatened while tyrants like Saddam Hussein are back in vogue among Palestinians, with the Iraqi leader repeating his promise to set half of Israel alight. Israeli hawks meantime threaten Syria. There is wild talk on all sides of a new war. In global terms the collapse of the power-sharing executive in Belfast seems no more than a little local difficulty. </p> <p>Nonetheless there are remarkable similarities between the two processes. Take the spark that lit the latest conflagration in Israel, Ariel Sharon's controversial visit to Moslem holy sites in Jerusalem. Sharon, like Paisley, is a visceral opponent of compromise with the enemy. The former Defence Minister uses grandiose stunts to further his unbending politico-religious ideology. Similarly Paisley made a name for himself in 1966 when he attempted to tear down a tricolour outside the Republican Clubs' election headquarters on the Falls Road. Both men share a bullish style in keeping with unyielding political outlooks. The space of earth that Sharon and Paisley will defend to the 'bitter end' (the Israeli general's own words) is captured in a brilliant phrase coined by the historian A T Q Stewart. It is 'the narrow ground' where the warring parties live cheek-by-jowl with each other. At the extremes there is quasi-religious certainty in the justice of their cause. Even in settled times both peoples exist in a cold and uneasy truce punctuated with violent incidents. </p> <p>Israeli writer Amos Oz has offered a dismal solution to the Palestinian problem. The two peoples sharing his 'narrow ground' should divorce and live apart. To paraphrase Oz - peace, yes but no love. The trouble with this panacea is the very narrowness of the ground in question. In Jerusalem, Jewish and Moslem holy sites lie literally on top of each other, posing serious problems for Oz's depressing remedy. Re-partition is well under way on a micro-level across Northern Ireland, particularly Belfast, with mini-walls separating people wishing to live apart, permanently. </p> <p>There is another worrying parallel between the two conflicts; namely radically different interpretations of what peace and agreement entail. Arafat has failed to sell the Oslo deal as final recognition of the State of Israel in exchange for territory and statehood. This has allowed sections of Fatah and the Hamas to cling on to their fantasies about eliminating the 'Zionist entity' from Tel Aviv to the Jordan. Republicans too have sold the Good Friday Agreement to their grass roots on the basis of it being a strategic gateway to a United Ireland in the next ten years. </p> <p>A crisis of expectations about what Oslo 1993 and Good Friday 1998 could produce now threatens to destroy the settlements. While the Middle East accord appears doomed, Northern Ireland's still has some life in it. Politicians and people in the province should look at the Holy Land before retreating into the extremism of no compromise on policing, decommissioning or de-militarisation.</p>",
  "<p>The most intriguing question about the internet is whether it will turn out to be a genuinely subversive technology or whether en-trenched power structures - governments, transnational corporations, cultural establishments - will eventually get a grip on it and subvert it to their own ends. </p> <p>Cyber-libertarians have never been in any doubt. Their view was summed up in John Gilmore's dictum that 'the internet interprets censorship as damage and routes around it'. Libertarian suspicion of the evil establishments of the 'real' world was tempered by the consoling thought that these institutions were also irredeemably stupid. </p> <p>The collective IQ of the net was always going to be greater than anything the FBI, GCHQ, Microsoft or the legal profession could muster. And whatever the forces of darkness came up with, the net community could easily circumvent, disrupt or subvert. The balance of power between freedom and control had been irrevocably shifted - and so the internet became a uniquely subversive technology. </p> <p>In principle, this argument remains valid. The technology of the net, and the fact that software is pure 'thought-stuff', means that the subversive creativity of the internet community cannot be snuffed out. There will always be 16-year-old hackers capable of inventing ingenious mouse-traps which can be distributed globally within minutes. Short of banning the use of computers, shutting down the global telephone network and shooting all 16-year-olds on sight, there is little any authority structure can do about it. </p> <p>Where the libertarian com munity errs is in thinking that this is all that matters. So long as the internet remained a virtual playground for geeks, Gilmore's mantra did indeed apply. It still does. </p> <p>But once the net became a mass medium, accessed and used by hundreds of millions of 'ordinary' people and firms - for email, entertainment and commerce - the complacent optimism of the libertarian position began to look like a philosophy of denial. </p> <p>The difference is that established power structures are able to exert much more leverage on a mass medium than they could on a geek playground. Most internet users now are 'ordinary' folk, who lack both the talent and the motivation to cock a snook at authority. They access the net through internet service providers, companies run by accountants who carry no torches for liberty or anarchy. </p> <p>And e-commerce companies aspire to the same status: they are after profits, stability, and the protection of their intellectual property. Few of the key players in the mass-internet want trouble with the established order; in a way they want to be part of it. </p> <p>The Napster case illustrates this. The libertarian position is that it doesn't matter what happens to Napster in the courts because the peer-to-peer (P2P) networking genie is out of the bottle. </p> <p>This is true but beside the point, which is that the moment somebody runs away with these subversive technologies they become something different - and are suddenly more vulnerable to legal attack. </p> <p>The thing about Napster, remember, is not so much that it had zillions of users, but that it wanted to become a billion-dollar company on the backs of those users. This is why the recording companies are so interested in it. </p> <p>'File-sharing means we have to think about a fundamental change of the business model,' Sony's chairman and chief executive told the Financial Times recently. </p> <p>The companies want to destroy Napster not because they desire to stamp out its disruptive technology, but because they want to deploy it for their own ends. </p> <p>Who are the real subversives now? </p> <p><br> <a href=\"mailto:john.naughton@observer.co.uk\">john.naughton@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "Those three little words no one wants to hear: you have cancer. The depth of the dread is probably why so many of us know so little about it, preferring to muck around with myths and half-truths. Both my parents had it. My wife is fully recovered from a skin melanoma. One of my best friends survived bowel cancer in his mid-twenties. And still my ignorance was wilfully deep. <p>Nor is it just us civilians who feel that way. 'Even the medical profession hides from the truth,' the doctor in our family told me. </p> <p>'I had an old and highly respected Harley Street specialist come to me and say he'd had bleeding from his rectum for some time - what might be wrong? Of course he knew it was colorectal cancer. He just didn't want to know. And when you tell people they have cancer, they ask as few questions as possible.'</p> <p>So let's tackle the questions we all find so hard to ask - and uncover the truth behind some of our myths.</p> <p><b> 1 You can catch it just like you catch a cold </b></p> <p>No, it's not a droplet disease. Nor is it water-borne like, say, cholera. But it's possible to catch diseases and viruses which can lead to it. Around 15 per cent of cancers worldwide are caused this way. Cervical cancer, for example, is virtually always (99.7 per cent) a consequence of HPV, a sexually transmitted infection. Liver cancer is 100 times more likely in hepatitis B victims - which is why it's one of the few cancers where the Third World has a lead over us. The major risk factor is that babies are infected by their mothers. </p> <p><b> 2 Flying gives you leukaemia</b></p> <p>Only if you are a long-term commercial pilot - in which case you are five times more likely to get it. The effect is related to the high number of hours flown and only applies to those who have put in more than 5,000 hours. Even serial business flyers like Rupert Murdoch don't rack up hours like that, so it's a purely professional risk. It's most likely caused by cosmic radiation which increases with altitude. So the higher you fly, the more marked the effect - presumably Concorde pilots ran (or flew) the greatest risk. The link was established by Dr Hans Storm of the Institute of Epidemiology, Copenhagen. 'The only way to avoid it,' he said, 'would be to limit the number of hours pilots are allowed to fly, just as they do with nuclear workers.' Airline pilots are also three times as likely to get skin cancer, but that's because they take more holidays in the sun.</p> <p><b> 3 City life gives you cancer</b></p> <p>No, there is no difference in incidence rate between our towns and our countryside. The same doesn't seem to be true, though, for survival rates. An Aberdeen University study found that rural Scots with stomach cancer were four times more likely to die before it was diagnosed. For breast cancer, it's three times. Why? Because country dwellers have worse access to specialist care than their town cousins.</p> <p><b> 4 It's man-made chemicals that are to blame</b></p> <p>Not really. Epidemiologists look elsewhere for the causes, by and large. The BMA estimates that 1 per cent of cancers are caused by food additives. The American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) says no more than 1 per cent of all cancers are a result of man-made chemicals. It's true that a 1999 German report and a more recent one by the US Environmental Protection Agency pointed the finger at dioxins, even coming up with a figure of their being responsible for 12 per cent of human cancers in industrialised countries. Other scientists, while not disputing that dioxins are poisonous, doubt that they are ingested in sufficient quantities and point out that there is no causal link evidence. There is no real evidence of increased cancers in Seveso, site of the worst dioxin exposure and the much-vaunted leukaemia link with water pollution in Worcester, Massachusetts - as recounted in the movie A Civil Action - is almost certainly false. Staggeringly, a majority of US citizens, when polled by the Discovery Channel, said they thought air pollution carried as big a cancer risk as heavy smoking. That's pretty much on a level with thinking the moon's made of green cheese. Still, maybe it's no coincidence. Believing some nasty big business out there is to blame for cancer has two advantages - it stops being your responsibility and, perhaps more importantly in the lawyer-heavy US, it affords you the opportunity to sue the bejaysus out of them. </p> <p><b> 5 There is more and more and more of it around</b></p> <p>Well, yes, but this is mostly because more of us live longer. It's overwhelmingly a disease of age - nearly two-thirds of all cancers occur in the over-65s. Also, fewer of us are dying of other diseases - and, death being death, we've all got to die of something. Still, even the age-standardised rates have risen. From 1971 to 1997, levels rose 13 per cent in men and 34 per cent in women. More recently, though, there has been a significant decline in male cancer - down 5.75 per cent since 1994. This is probably because of the long-term drop in lung- cancer rates - down 33 per cent from 1986 to 1997. Female cancers, though, have risen a little recently, but they're still below their 1992 peak. In the US, by the way, it's fallen even faster - 10 per cent down overall since the 1992 peak. </p> <p><b> 6 Every second person seems to have it</b></p> <p>Almost. In the US, 48 per cent and 37 per cent of women will get cancer at some point during their life. The UK figure is a little lower. According to the Imperial Cancer Research Fund (ICRF), just over one in three will get it, one in four will die of it. Currently, the male five-year survival rate is just 31 per cent, while the female is 43 per cent. Five years is the cancer experts' preferred definition of 'survival'.</p> <p><b> 7 There was some blood in my stools for a bit, but then it stopped, so I haven't got cancer</b></p> <p>Maybe, maybe not. Cancerous polyps do bleed intermittently. </p> <p><b> 8 Cervical cancer is a promiscuity thing</b></p> <p>Afraid so. The younger a woman is when she first has sex and the more sexual partners she has in her lifetime, the greater her chance of getting cervical cancer. That's because it's one of the few cancers caused by something you can catch. More than 99 per cent of women who get it have the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV). Male promiscuity is also a major cause - women who've only had one partner also get HPV. Male promiscuity, combined with lower hygiene levels, is often the problem in the Third World - men catch HPV from prostitutes and infect their wives and lovers. Colombia, for example, has the world's highest rate. There is an HPV test, but trials have had varying results. In some, it's proved accurate. In others, it has produced a number of both false-positives and false-negatives - though the trials weren't large enough to establish whether the numbers were unacceptably large. As recently as September 1999, Dr Peter Sasieni of the ICRF said that adding it routinely 'would certainly lead to greatly increased costs without necessarily significantly decreasing the amount of cancers'. However, both he and the ICRF now believe 'that HPV testing holds great promise as a primary screening method. It has an abnormality detection rate of about 90 per cent compared to 75 or less for a smear test.' Currently, it's being tested on borderline cases - still 250,000 a year. Cervical screening is already working. It cut cases by 42 per cent between 1988 and 1997, and deaths have fallen by 50 per cent in the last 15 years.</p> <p><b> 9 Male circumcision prevents cervical cancer</b></p> <p>There is some evidence for this. In India, Muslim women have a lower rate of cervical cancer than Hindus and Christians. It certainly seems to prevent penile cancer, which is virtually never seen in circumcised men.</p> <p><b> 10 I've got genital warts: that means cervical cancer somewhere down the line, right?</b></p> <p>Almost certainly not. When it comes to cervical cancer, if you can see the problem with the naked eye, it means you haven't got a problem. Nasty but true. More than 60 variants of HPV have been identified. Genital warts are produced by HPV Types 6 and 11, which have no link with cervical cancer. The danger ones are HPV 16, 18, 33, 35 and 45. The big problem is they're mostly 'silent'. Many of us have these HPVs, very few of us know it - a big deal when your chances with cervical cancer are directly related to the disease's progress by the time of diagnosis. Have a pap smear, basically. Because, in the words of the American National Cancer Institute, 'properly treated, tumour control of cervical cancer should be nearly 100 per cent.'</p> <p><b> 11 Extremely overweight people are more likely to develop it</b></p> <p>Some American sources say there is a connection between obesity and cancer. The ICRF says the link is not clear. There are two exceptions, though. Obese women are three to five times more likely to get endometrial (lining of the uterus) cancer and obese post-menopausal women run an increased risk of breast cancer.</p> <p><b> 12 More men die of testicular cancer than women do of breast cancer</b></p> <p>Not so. Testicular cancer is a very rare disease. It accounts for just one per cent of male cancers - in England and Wales in 1999, 71 died of it, compared to the 11,548 women who died of breast cancer. Incidence has doubled over the last 20 years - though it may now be on the decline since a 1996 peak. It is one of the few cancers that attacks the young. Nine out of 10 cases are in under-55s - and non-descended testicles by the age of seven is a strong indicator for it. The survival rate is excellent, however - almost 95 per cent.</p> <p><b> 13 OK then, more men die of prostate cancer than women of breast cancer</b></p> <p>Wrong again, though the figures are a little closer. Breast cancer is the leading killer disease for women between 35 and 54. According to the Office for National Statistics, the lifetime risk is one in nine. Prostate cancer, by contrast, is a one in 14 shot - still 10,000 deaths a year, with a 41 per cent survival rate. Breast cancer survival rates are rapidly improving, though. It kills some 13,000 British women a year, of the 35,000 who develop it. But that is far better than it was. Since the late 80s, when we had one of the lowest survival rates in Europe, deaths have fallen by 30 per cent, faster than anywhere else in the world. That was from a very high starting point, though, so more women are still dying in Britain than in America, Australia and some of Europe.</p> <p><b> 14 Breast cancer is killing more and more young women</b></p> <p>Definitely not. Death rates have been reduced by 30 per cent in young and middle-aged victims - mostly because of the efficacy of tamoxifen, a cheap and effective drug which blocks hormone receptors on cancer cells, interfering with their growth. It probably saves more lives than any other form of non-surgical cancer treatment. In younger women, chemotherapy after surgery has made a bid difference to death rates.</p> <p><b> 15 Left-handers are more likely to get breast cancer, so are virgins</b></p> <p>Yes and yes. The left-hand difference - which is 'modest' - was reported in the journal Epidemiology. A suggestion is that there is a link to the hypothesis that intrauterine exposure to steroid hormones may play a role in the development of breast cancer, as well as influencing handedness. Virgins are more likely to get it because they don't have children. Breast cancer is closely linked to oestrogen levels. Asian women in Asia, for example, have low levels of both -and British women high ones. Having babies, particularly when you're young, lowers the risk. By contrast, the fewer children you have, the greater your risk. Other risks are late menopause and having a first child after 30 - the older you are, the greater the danger. According to Dr Hilakivi-Clarke of the AICR, it now seems that the impact of high oestrogen levels varies through a woman's life. In the reproductive years, they have no effect at all. In the womb and after menopause, they increase the risk. During childhood, they now appear to play a 'powerful protective role'. </p> <p><b> 16 Routine mammograms are a waste of time for over-65s</b></p> <p>No, says the US. Yes, said the ICRF till just the other week - 'There is no good medical reason to justify the decision.' No, it now says. In the last week of September, the government announced that routine screening would be extended to 65- to 70-year-olds by 2004.</p> <p><b> 17 I've got a painful lump in my breast, so I must have cancer</b></p> <p>Most likely not - 90 per cent of breast cancer tumours are not painful, according to a clinician. It is far more likely to be an abscess, which is then always painful.</p> <p><b> 18 Every man, if he lived long enough, would eventually get prostate cancer</b></p> <p>Probably. The death toll has doubled over the last 20 years, and in 20 years' time, 50,000 men a year will get it. According to Dr Peter Sasieni, statistician for the ICRF, 40 per cent of all 80-year-old men have it - this was established through post-mortems. Many won't know they've got it, as it develops slowly and they'll die of something else first. 'You can assume that the incidence increases with age. So if men lived to over 120 or so, it is possible they would all get prostate cancer.' But not necessarily die of it. It looks as if there could well be a form of prostate cancer that just sits there and grows very slowly.</p> <p><b> 19 The PSA test has transformed the survival rate for prostate cancer</b></p> <p>The jury's out on this. In the US, prostate cancer deaths have dropped 10 per cent since the early 90s - both experts and patient groups attribute this to the prostate-specific antigen test (PSA) which is a simple blood test. Experts here are nowhere near as convinced, pointing out the test's low accuracy level - it produces an unacceptable number of both false-positives and false-negatives. One of the big problems is figuring out whether a tumour is aggressive or not. New research seems to have pinpointed the eight genes which are responsible for the disease.</p> <p><b> 20 Black Americans are more likely to get prostate cancer than whites</b></p> <p> True. No one knows why. </p> <p><b> 21 There's this Chinese herb stuff which really zaps prostate cancer</b></p> <p>Absolutely. Western researchers call it PC-SPES. It's an over-the-counter powder supplement with eight different plants in it: isatis, liquorice, lucid ganoderma, pseudo-ginseng, rubescens, saw palmetto and scute. Research is at an early stage, but when rats on PC-SPES were injected with cancer cells, only 60 per cent of them got tumours - compared to the usual 99. Lab tests by Dr Jan Geliebter of New York Medical College further showed that PC-SPES 'strongly inhibits' the growth of prostate cancer cells in culture.</p> <p><b> 22 So vegetarians get less cancer</b></p> <p>No. Eating five portions of fruit and veg a day - whether you're a carnivore, a vegetarian or a vegan - is the thing that could keep Mr C away, or at least make him less likely to come calling. For 20 years, experts have pointed out that red meat and saturated fats are laden with the bad stuff - the chemicals that kick off the process which leads to cancer - while the good stuff is in fruit and vegetables: phytochemicals and antioxidants which fight it. The conclusion propounded was that meat-eating was the problem. Not so. A recent piece of research by the ICRF found that vegetarians are just as likely to die of bowel cancer as meat eaters. Nor was there any difference in breast, prostate, lung or stomach cancer. 'Our analysis suggests that meat itself may have little effect on the development of the disease,' says the ICRF's Dr Timothy Key - a fairly categorical statement by scientific standards. Another study, by the US National Cancer Institute, found that people on a low-fat, high-fibre diet seemed to stand as much chance of developing pre-cancerous growths in their colons as those who steaked up and burgered out. But it's hard to know what to read into that. Questions are definitely begged. What do pre-cancerous growths, for example, have to say about cancerous ones? And what about cancers outside the colon? Still, a recent AICR expert review of 247 studies found that 78 per cent showed that vegetables and fruit protected against cancer. So best keep having salad with those chips.</p> <p><b> 23 Garlic beats cancer</b></p> <p>A recent study-review by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH) suggests that those who regularly eat garlic - raw or cooked - run half the risk of stomach cancer and two-thirds the risk of colon cancer. The AICR recommends eating two to five cloves a week or taking garlic supplements, though the UNC-CH found no benefit in supplements. Why does garlic help? The suggestion is it's because it attacks helicobacter pylori which is closely linked to stomach cancer.</p> <p><b> 24 Fruit juice stops you getting cancer </b></p> <p>It probably helps. A glass of juice counts as one portion of the five a day of fruit and vegetables that the WHO and other experts say will lower your risk. For these purposes, by the way, potatoes and nuts don't count as vegetables.</p> <p><b> 25 Vegans, then. They get less cancer</b></p> <p>They certainly have lower levels of IGF-I - Insulin-like Growth Factor-I - which increases the risk of prostate cancer. 'Even small differences are predictive,' says Dr Timothy Key. Low levels are found in places where little meat or dairy products are eaten. An ICRF study revealed that IGF-I levels are 9 per cent lower in vegans than in meat eaters. However, says an epidemiologist, 'studies with big leaps of faith - the technical term is \"proxy outcomes\" - from a chemical to a disease don't get me too excited.'</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/life/story/0,6903,382676,00.html\" target=\"_new\">Read the second part of Truths and myths here</a></p>",
  "My grandmother never set foot in a bank in her entire life. Living in rural Ireland on next to nothing, it was never really an issue. By the next generation down, my family had migrated up the social scale as far as central heating and a colour telly, but not so far as home ownership or bank accounts. Anything beyond the basics was acquired slowly ('85 weeks at 50p!') and paid for in cash out of weekly brown envelopes. <p>Definitions of affluence are always relative, but in recent history we've used the previous generation as the benchmark. By that definition, I'm doing just fine. I have a nice house, a people-carrier car and multiple bank accounts. I often have money left over when my bills have been paid, which I spend on taxis and restaurants and a cleaner. But the nice house comes with a big mortgage, the people carrier is six years old, and the multiple bank accounts are a necessity for moving debt around rather than paying it off. </p> <p>I earn a professional-level salary - more in one year than my dad earned in five - and I never have enough money. Right now the things I can't afford include: a new computer for my self, a flute (\u00a3400) for my daughter, an extra bedroom, an extra bathroom, and one of those fabulous walk-in wardrobes. It's an extravagant list of things I want rather than need, but what does 'need' mean after an eight-year economic boom, and five decades in which the whole country has grown steadily richer? </p> <p>Between the 40s and the 90s, incomes in the UK have almost trebled in real terms, but we don't feel richer. The overheated housing market, student fees, the vagaries of 'rip-off Britain' and the audacious cost of designer trainers for 11-year-olds conspire to keep us on the wrong side of solvent. For the past four years, we've been spending more than we earn, drawing heavily on savings and share income to keep up, while the amount of consumer credit outstanding is currently around \u00a3600 billion - equivalent to more than \u00a310,000 for every adult in the country. </p> <p>Nor do we feel happier. Research by Andrew Oswald, professor of economics at Warwick University, shows that our reported levels of happiness are remarkably unaffected by our affluence, and lower than in many less well-off countries. So, how much do we need to earn to feel comfortably off? And why are we knocking ourselves out with the longest working week in Europe if the money it makes us doesn't even cheer us up?</p> <p>Part of the problem is that most of this new affluence is increasingly weighted towards a very small proportion of the population - the already rich. According to research carried out by John Hills from the London School of Economics, income became more unevenly distributed during the 90s than at any time since the Second World War. While fat cats and dot.com squillionaires are apparently multiplying at a depressing rate, they form only a tiny elite. My inadequate professional income puts me in the top 20 per cent of wage earners in the country. The average household income in the UK is only just over \u00a320,000 (and that's income, including benefits, investments and pensions, not just salary), and one in five working-age people live on less than half of that. Many of us don't feel richer because we aren't. </p> <p>But the rest of us don't have that excuse. We know that we're living lives of unprecedented affluence, even as we struggle to keep up with our desires and aspirations. I have more money than my dad ever did, but nowhere near as much as my sister, and that's the problem. The generational benchmark no longer applies. Instead, according to Oswald, we look over our shoulders at our neighbours, friends and colleagues. How are we doing compared to them? If we're satisfied there, we scale up, comparing ourselves to the characters in films and on TV, or to Posh and Becks. When Wallace Simpson said that you couldn't be too rich or too thin, she hit on a bitter, bitter truth. There's always someone who is richer or thinner. </p> <p>But even that doesn't fully explain our odd disaffection with our finances. Fifty years of growing affluence has precipitated and mirrored 50 years of the fastest and most far-reaching social and cultural change in history. Our attitudes to fundamentals like saving and debt have been transformed in the space of a single generation. New ways of working, living and thinking have created new economic models and attitudes.</p> <p>The new economy is still more hype and hypothesis than it is reality, but it's a stone in a pond, and the ripples are spreading. New, technology-driven occupations are producing a working model where old career and pay structures don't apply. Like Nicola Evans, who works in IT, and headhunter Paul Gattaora, (interviewed below,) young people can head companies, run teams, be promoted three times and earn huge salaries, all within a few years of leaving college. All they have to do in return is work themselves into the ground. </p> <p>This creates new social and spending models of its own. The hundreds of thousands of homes that need to be built over the next decade are not for families, but for young professional singles like Nicola and Philip McQueen, who works in the pharmaceuticals industry (see below). The huge boom in domestic labour - cleaners, gardeners, caterers and concierge services who will water your plants and pick up your dry cleaning - is being fed by a rising tide of cash-rich, time-poor professionals, not by ladies who lunch. </p> <p>It's a high-pressure life, and even the high salaries aren't always enough to sustain it. Paul, Nicola and Philip all talked about working hard now and getting out early. They may be fooling themselves - pension planning and saving remain woefully inadequate in the UK, and a high-income life can be an inescapable trap. But in their life plans, the old pattern of 40-year careers is being condensed into half that. What happens to them - and the wider economy - if they all bow out of the labour market at 45 or 50 is a script that's still being written. </p> <p>Those with average salaries or more traditional careers aren't exempt from the long-hours culture, or from the relentless need to spend to keep up. The large number of mothers in the workforce, and the rise of the two-career couple, means we're all caught in the same time-squeeze. </p> <p>All of which creates a totally new kind of consumer, and a new raft of sales opportunities in the global shopping mall. In the marketing departments of every major 'brand' on earth, budgets are being doubled and strategies created specifically to target this new consumer group with enough clothes, records and techie toys to last them a lifetime, and who really need never buy anything much again. They are cynical about advertising, don't like being sold to and don't have time to shop. So the marketeers don't sell them things, but experiences and time. That bubble bath isn't a glass jar full of water and chemicals, it's an hour of precious downtime. Those walking boots aren't boots, they're an alternative identity as a free, country dwelling, outdoors man-of-action. Exhausted, tunnel-visioned and isolated, the new consumers spend money like water, buying a facsimile of everything they're missing while they spend all those hours at work - like time, nurture, and fresh air.</p> <p>And even if you can remain immune to the lure of labels and 'experience marketing', your kids will succumb on your behalf. As parents Janet Whitton and John Kelleher attest, having children changes everything, and not just because they cost a lot and give you new and previously unimagined things to worry about. Providing what they want now is only the start of it. Deposits for houses (because no one can afford one without parental help), the cost of higher education, and planning for your own retirement so as not to become a financial burden, put even good incomes under an impossible strain. I'd like to retire at 50 myself, but my daughter will only be 20 then and hopefully spending my money on text books and student accommodation. </p> <p>Many parents are now looking at supporting their children, at least partially, well into their twenties or even thirties. This may explain the rising tide of national debt, our new-found tolerance for it, and the parallel rise in the number of couples electing to skip those 30 years of anguish and expense all together and remain childless. The way we spend our money reveals not just our lifestyles, but our natures, our values, our fears, and our national identity. Money has become the way we express ourselves, demonstrate love, and compensate ourselves for the high price of achieving it. No wonder we feel as if we've never got enough of it.</p> <p> <b>Janet Whitton (\u00a319,000)</b><br> 45, married, teacher with three children (husband owns his own business), lives in Berkshire</p> <p>When Janet Whitton had her first child 14 years ago, she gave up her job as an air stewardess to be a full-time mother. It was a privilege - her husband earned enough to support them all - and her choice. It was also one of the hardest things she'd ever done. </p> <p>'I loved being with the baby, but I had a hard time not having my own income. For my generation of women, economic independence was a guiding principle. I found that I felt completely differently about myself. I've never been very money-orientated or materialistic, but for the first time I began to think about money a lot.' Four years ago, with her children growing up, she trained as a teacher. 'It's not a huge salary, obviously, but it makes an enormous difference to me.' Her husband pays the mortgage and the bills, while Janet buys the family's food 'about \u00a3400 a month'. </p> <p>When she was younger 'and miserable', she ran up her credit cards to a point where things got painful. 'I realised I was trying to salve my misery with shopping.' These days, she's happy, and a model of financial propriety. Credit cards are paid off every month, and although she sometimes makes it to payday by the skin of her teeth, she doesn't get overdrawn. 'My salary is adequate because my husband can afford to pay the biggest bills, but I feel for my fellow teachers. The young ones are paying off student loans, and will be for years.'</p> <p>A significant proportion of Janet's salary goes on buying teaching materials for her class. 'I spent about \u00a360 in August on maths sets, models, all that kind of stuff. Nobody makes me do it, but I want the kids to have the best resources, and I don't want to put the school under an impossible strain. I don't resent it at all. That's my choice.' She also buys bits and pieces for the house. 'I'm paying \u00a345 a month for two leather sofas'; '\u00a3210 a month for a year-old Rover 200'; and she buys clothes for the children.</p> <p>'That's my biggest financial headache. I buy my own clothes from Gap or Laura Ashley, but my daughter only wants designer labels.' Like all children, Janet's are sophisticated and relentless consumers, 'they are so susceptible to advertising and peer pressure, and they put enormous pressure on their parents in turn. It's all Calvin Klein and DKNY, and I really resent it.' But she does give in. 'More than I should. It becomes so important to them.' </p> <p>Andrew Oswald's reflection on all definitions of affluence being relative is completely realised in Janet's situation. 'We live in Berkshire. I can drive a couple of miles in one direction to the school where I work, and see people who are genuinely in need. One child won a merit badge for sports, and we asked the parents to contribute 75p for the cost of the badge. I had a note sent back explaining that they couldn't afford it.' But she can drive a few miles in the opposite direction and she's bang in the middle of the Home Counties commuter belt. 'The houses are worth five, six million. And then I suddenly feel quite poor.'</p> <p>According to Karen Rowlingson, a lecturer in social policy at the University of Bath, this 360-degree vision makes Janet unusually well balanced. 'Most of us tend to mix only with our own peer group, and that's how we decide if we're financially comfortable or not. Some people are very well off by national standards and just don't feel it, because they've got no idea of how the rest of the country lives.' Janet agrees. 'I think we're fine. We're about the right-sized fish for our own pond. In an ideal world, I'd like \u00a320k a year without having to work for it, but that's just dreaming. My neighbour won \u00a3120,000 on the Lottery and I wasn't remotely jealous - just delighted for them. But I've started doing the Lottery now.' </p> <p>When Janet worries about money, it's about the future, not the present. 'I want for both my husband and I to retire young - early fifties - and then have time and money to travel. But I don't know whether we'll be able to; we don't really save, apart from pensions.' Like most people in the South East, she's invested her hopes in the runaway housing market. 'I'm hoping we'll have enough equity in the house to help.' She already has money put aside for the children's education. 'Otherwise I'd be worried sick. We're reaching a point with loans and fees where working-class kids will be barred from higher education again. That is desperately sad.'</p> <p> <b>John Kelleher (\u00a335,000 + bonus )</b><br>53, married, shopping-centre manager with one son aged 24, lives in Birmingham</p> <p>At 53, John Kelleher is perfectly placed to see just how much change one generation has made to our attitudes to money. 'When I first started work, I was an apprentice at a local light engineering factory. My father believed that if I got an apprenticeship to a proper trade I'd be financially secure for life. He was completely wrong.' John has been paying into a pension since his twenties. But, unlike many younger people, he never expected to retire at 50. 'I've never been a get-rich-quick person. It's been slow and steady for me, and it's only in the past 10 years that I've begun to feel less financially anxious and more secure.' Apart from his pension, John has gradually made money - at least on paper - through his house. 'My wife Maureen and I bought our first house in our twenties for \u00a34,750. </p> <p>In the early days, he had sleepless nights worrying about money. 'Of course I did. Suppose I'd lost my job? Suppose we couldn't quite make all the payments one month?' After a couple of years, things got easier. The mortgage got more manageable and John and Maureen traded up. 'We've always had this strategy of buying the worst possible house in the best possible location, and doing it up.'</p> <p>Slow but steady, they now live in a 'very nice, big house'. Maureen's adding an extension this year, which will set them back \u00a335,000. 'But that's also our future. We'll sell and move somewhere smaller when we retire.' John has always been a saver and a financial planner, a comparative rarity in Britain where one in four adults has no pension provision at all, and where we currently save less than we have since the boom spending years of Nigel Lawson's 80s. According to Professor Paul Webley, an economics psychologist at the University of Exeter, our poor saving record generally is another indication of our increasingly individualistic society. 'Saving behaviour is long-term behaviour. People do it when they think 10 years and more ahead. And the people who do that tend to be family or community orientated, which gives them a long-term perspective - they know what and who they are saving for.'</p> <p>Managing a shopping centre has made John a jaded consumer. 'As you get older, the fog lifts. You start thinking how much surplus stuff everyone has, and how so much of it is basically pricey rubbish.' These days, about 50 per cent of his salary goes on the mortgage and essential bills. The other half is spent on the house, meals out, the musicals he loves and on golf, his big passion that costs about \u00a330 a round. He likes to spoil the family at Christmas and birthdays, 'but I can still get shocked at the price of things for children. My nephew and niece wear shoes that cost \u00a3150 just for school.' He wouldn't spend that on himself ('Kids are the label obsessives'), and buys his suits at a discount retailer.</p> <p>John's 24-year-old son still lives at home. 'He has no choice. All his friends are the same. It's virtually impossible for young people to get on to the housing ladder now. I worry about them. There's so much pressure on them financially, and to work and earn more and more. If I won the Lottery tomorrow, I'd love to start a business of my own. Partly for my sake, but partly so that I could leave something to my son to get him established in life.'</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/life/story/0,6903,382674,00.html\" target=\"_new\">Read part two of 21st century money herrehere</a></p>",
  "<p>In goods we trust. The power of brands and the people who manage them is growing rapidly as the influence of traditional, loftier sources of identity and power - the church, class, the monarchy - wane. We used to define ourselves by religion, what our parents did, how we spoke, where we went to school. Now, we express ourselves and derive trust and emotional fulfilment by the way we consume. </p> <p>Tony Blair started it by using a car to identify his key target voter - Mondeo man. Nine years after his infamous encounter with a disaffected Ford owner, more people drive Fords than vote in by-elections. Supermarket club cardholders outnumber churchgoers. Airline frequent flier programmes boast more members than political parties. </p> <p>We are what we buy - or what we aspire to buy. Ask the young what they believe in today and they will say the labels they wear, the phones they use, the cars they drive, the food they eat. For them, Sony, Orange, IKEA, DKNY, Tommy Hilfiger, Disney, Planet Organic, Apple, Diet Coke, Body Shop, Starbucks, Nike, and Virgin deliver more emotion and attitude than anything else on the planet. </p> <p>We relate to these icons because their corporate names, logos, or images offer emotional value - a 'big idea' - far in excess of the mere product itself. Orange stands for optimism, Disney for fun, Virgin for youthful iconoclasm, Body Shop for a better form of capitalism, Nike for winning, Starbucks for sociability, Apple for difference. The barons of branding spend millions creating these values because it is the only way of differentiating products and making money in a world where there is a surplus of almost everything, few products are bad, and most can be copied. As Robert Jones puts it in his new book The Big Idea: 'What you stand for is now much more important than what you do.' </p> <p>Successful brands are smart, friendly and, like good friends, they weave themselves into the fabric of our lives. They cheer us up 'because we are worth it'. They help us to tell people who we are - 'I wear Diesel jeans, not Levi's, because I am young-at-heart.' They help to guide us through the daunting maze of choice that is exploding everywhere from travel to financial services. British Airways is much more than an airline. If you trust it to fly, you will also trust its credit cards, its rental cars, its wine club. </p> <p>Brands are now the most powerful forces on earth. Some cover almost all bodily and social functions. You can eat Virgin food in a Virgin hotel; drink Virgin cola; wear Virgin clothes and cosmetics; use a Virgin mobile; surf the Virgin.net; use Virgin condoms; go to a Virgin doctor; buy a car through Virgin with money from your Virgin account; get married with Virgin brides; buy your house with a Virgin mortgage; listen to Virgin radio; see Virgin-funded films in a Virgin cinema; work out in a Virgin Active gym; play Virgin video games as you go on holiday on a Virgin train or plane, stopping only to buy your Virgin vodka in duty free. </p> <p>There is a backlash, of course - Reclaim the Streets, Seattle, Prague - but, in the global capitalist battle, brands are the victor. As Jane Pavitt, who has just completed the first exhibition devoted to brands which opens at the Victoria and Albert Museum this week, puts it: 'The idea of the brand is synonymous with our age. Brands colonise our lives. Our whole society has been branded.' </p> <p><br><a href=\"mailto:john.arlidge@observer.co.uk\">john.arlidge@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>It was one of the most high-profile competition inquiries ever - and, at an estimated cost of \u00a320 million, one of the most expensive. The main tenet was unashamedly populist: the big supermarket groups are conspiring to rip off customers and bankrupt suppliers to keep their profit margins high. </p> <p>All the more embarrassing then that the industry has been so comprehensively let off the hook. As The Observer revealed last month, while the Commission found evidence of unfair competition and restrictive practices, which acted against the public interest, it is not recommending any major changes to address this. </p> <p>The supermarkets have es-caped unscathed. Their relief could, however, be short-lived. For the last two years the big food retailers have been paralysed by uncertainty. No one was brave enough to launch bids, engineer mergers or agree the alliances that have long been talked about, because of the risk that the Competition Commissioners would rule them out. </p> <p>Now that the final report has been made public, all that will change. The industry will be able to switch its attention from shouting about how competitive it is, to engineering deals to reduce the intensity of that competition. In-deed, some believe the report effectively gives the green light to any combination of the major companies, regardless of how large their share of shoppers' purses. The commissioners conclude that the supermarket industry is local: how many of us would drive more than 20 minutes to get to a supermarket, never mind travel to a different part of the country? </p> <p>Some analysts believe that means Tesco could, in theory, bid for Sainsbury, even though it would have more than 30 per cent of the national market, provided Tesco could demonstrate that it does not have a monopoly in any local area or was willing to sell stores where that could be a problem. </p> <p>In practice, however, Tesco would find it hard to do a deal with any of its British rivals. It is, by some way, the largest of the four big chains, with a share of over 17 per cent. Even Safeway, the smallest of the big four, has more than 10 per cent of the market so a bid would take it over the 25 per cent trigger for a competition referral. More worrying, however, is Tesco's dominance in the South of England. The Commissioners report that there are five areas, including Cambridge and Salisbury, where it has more than half the market, and some estimate that there are at least 70 areas where it has a 40 per cent share. Add in virtually any of the other majors and Tesco would end up having to sell so many sites that it would make the deal pointless. </p> <p>The one possible acquisition for Tesco is Wm Morrison, the Bradford-based chain. It is expanding southwards, but its strength is still in its northern homeland so the overlap with Tesco would be smaller than under any other combination. But it has been expertly run by the indomitable Ken Morrison for the past 40 years and he shows no signs of wanting to sell out. Even if he did, the rest of the Morrison family, who between them own more than 30 per cent of the company's shares, would be likely to demand an exceptionally high price. </p> <p>Family shareholdings also offer some protection at Sainsbury, generally acknowledged as the weakest of the big four. The protection is weakening, however. David Sainsbury, the last member of the founding family to work in the group, left the board two years ago, and even the most patient of the family shareholders must be growing irritated by the chain's recent poor performance. As with Morrisons, however, family loyalty means a bidder would have to pay a high price to win their acceptance for a bid. </p> <p>The alternative is a merger with one of the other groups. That could mean the Sainsbury name would continue, but give the family a smaller stake in a bigger group. </p> <p>Safeway, the smallest of the big four, is the obvious candidate. It is recovering rapidly under Carlos Criado-Perez, who learnt his skill at Wal-Mart. This is the combination that would most alarm Tesco. The merged company would be the clear market leader, and Sainsbury's strength in the South-east would complement Safeway's Scottish dominance. </p> <p>Tesco has almost as much to fear from a second possible combination, seen by some industry watchers as the most likely of the possible permutations: a takeover of Safeway by Wal-Mart, which would then put it with Asda, acquired two years ago. </p> <p>This potential combination has an impeccable logic. When the Asda deal was done, Wal-Mart made no secret of the fact that it intended to become the number one in Europe, just as it is in the US. It has a long way to go. Its German business, bought just before Asda, is making losses and the US giant seems unable to work out how to fix it. </p> <p>It has yet to make much impact in Britain either. There are constant tales of management disarray, supported by the recent departure of Allan Leighton, the former Asda chief executive. Its sales have not grown as expected and it seems not to have converted British consumers, weaned on special offers, to its American mantra of everyday low prices. </p> <p>Some believe Wal-Mart's troubles in Europe make a bid for Safeway more likely. 'It has to get on or get out,' said a supermarket executive. A bid for Safeway would still leave it behind Tesco in the pecking order but the extra scale should make its strategy easier to execute. </p> <p>Others, however, believe it will concentrate on sorting out Asda first and that, when it does turn to acquisitions again, Boots rather than Safeway will be the target. Wal-Mart understands that market better; its strength in the US is outside food. Most tellingly, Boots' wide margins and depressed share price make it easier both to acquire for a reasonable price, and to cut prices while maintaining decent profits. </p> <p>Tesco's concern about either of the Safeway combinations has led it to float the idea of a break-up bid for the group. That would suit it perfectly. Tesco could get its hands on some of its favourite Safeway sites, as well as preventing its rivals challenging its dominance. </p> <p>The prospect of Tesco securing agreement for such a deal is, however, remote. 'There are huge problems with a consortium bid,' said one analyst. 'There would have to be a lead bidder - who would take on that role? They could have to pay as much as \u00a35 billion - where would they raise that kind of money?' </p> <p>Most of the intrigue centres on a British deal, but that does not mean a foreign bid is ruled out. Indeed, some predict that Carrefour, the French retailer, will eschew the weaker players and bid for Tesco. But Tesco's shares have been rising, partly on the expectation of a favourable result from the competition inquiry. If Carrefour had been planning a bid, it would have made sense to move earlier. It has no British interests, so would have been unaffected by the inquiry. </p> <p>The only thing everyone agrees on is that there are too many food retailers for them all to make decent returns - even the Commission found no evidence of excessive profits. Consolidation is inevitable. Now the inquiry is over, how that will happen is about to become clear.</p>",
  "<p>It does not take much to make investors nervous in October - remember 1987 and 1990, not to mention 1929 - so the last thing the City needs is someone drawing parallels between the current markets and some of those big crashes. </p> <p>The fall in the FTSE All-Share Index in the three months to September was its third consecutive quarterly drop - the first time that has happened since 1973-74. The FTSE 100 Index has been going roughly nowhere for the last three years, the longest sideways spell since the crash in October 1987. Chartist William Adlard is drawing lines and diamonds all over graphs of the main stock market indices, and warning of further stock market weakness. </p> <p>But no one, not even Adlard or Tony Jackson, the equity strategist at Charterhouse Securities who highlighted the FTSE trends, is predicting that this October will bring another crash. </p> <p>That may be partly because, as one strategist put it, the bears have been wrong for so long that they no longer have any credibility. 'If I say to my clients that prices could actually fall sharply, they do not want to know,' he said. 'They say \"unless you can tell me what is going to cause it, or when it is going to happen, we are not interested\".' </p> <p>But it may be because, for many investors, the crash has already happened. The stock market is more or less where it was two years ago, but that surface calm disguises huge swings in individual shares and sectors. </p> <p>For a start, take the behaviour of technology stocks over the last two months. Both Nasdaq and its British equivalent, the Techmark 100, have lost around a fifth of their value since the start of September. Taken from their peaks in March, the slide has been an even more dramatic 40 per cent. That may not quite rival 1973-74, when the All-Share dropped by two thirds in a year, or 1929, when US prices fell by 87 per cent over three years, but it is roughly the same as the fall in British shares between October and December 1987. That may, with hindsight, look like just a brief correction but it felt like a crash at the time. </p> <p>The key difference is the speed of the fall. This time round, the decline has been gradual. While there have been bad days, the falls have generally been of 100 points or so - bad, but not that significant in percentage terms. In 1929, by contrast, US shares fell by 13.5 per cent on 28 October and a further 11.7 per cent the following day. In 1987, the All-Share dropped 9.7 per cent on Black Monday - 19 October - and a further 11 per cent the following day. If markets were to fall by a similar percentage now, it would mean a fall of more than 1,200 points in the FTSE 100 index. </p> <p>But 1987 has taught us that what Alan Greenspan of the US Federal Reserve calls 'irrational exuberance' must be paid for. The crash then came after a period of sharply rising prices - the Dow, for example, gained 44 per cent between January and October. The falls that followed simply corrected much of that excess. </p> <p>So, too, with recent falls. Most investors agree that the dramatic rise in technology shares between November last year and March 2000 was excessive. The Techmark 100 may have been in the doldrums since March, but it is still more than 40 per cent above its level when it launched in October 1999. Some of the riskier technology stocks - like 365 Corporation or QXL - are standing below the prices at which they were floated. However, the shares of many companies that are already profiting from the new economy - including software suppliers such as CMG or service companies such as Capita - have risen sharply in the last two years. </p> <p>But what about those unfortunate companies that the market has decided are not part of the bright new technological future? They did not share in the big spring bounce but are still out of favour even though investors are being more realistic about the technology miracle. Their performance has been painful for those unlucky enough to be stuck with them. Companies such as Marks &amp; Spencer, Imperial Chemical Industries and Whitbread are 60 per cent or more below the highs of the past two years. </p> <p>Swathes of the stock market - food manufacturers, retailers, cigarette makers and water and electricity companies - have been in decline for much of the last two years. Value investors, who have traditionally made a living from buying such cheap stocks and waiting for them to recover, have joined the bears in hibernation. Growth, it seems, is all investors are looking for these days. </p> <p>However, the falls in old economy stocks are becoming less indiscriminate. Companies such as Next and Tesco, which are prospering despite the depressed high street, or Royal Bank of Scotland, which is expected to grow strongly following its acquisition of NatWest, have all seen their shares marked up sharply in the last few months. It is those that have not yet shown that they can prosper in a low-inflation, highly competitive environment that are being shunned. </p> <p>The trouble is that, even after the falls of the last six months, the growth stocks that investors want are still not coming cheap. The telecoms sector is priced at 78 times last year's earnings, software groups such as Sage and Logica are on similar multiples. That can only be justified if the growth at least meets, and ideally beats, market expectations. But there are increasing signs that the technology miracle may not be quite what it was cracked up to be. </p> <p>Company after company - Lucent, Apple, Yahoo, Motorola, Dell - have disappointed the market. Revenge has been swift. Yahoo, for example, plunged 17.5 per cent, despite reporting record profits in line with expectations, because it admitted that advertising from dotcom companies was slowing. </p> <p>So far, however, the bad news has largely been confined to the other side of the Atlantic. Over here, the news has generally been positive. That is encouraging for Michael O'Sullivan, equity strategist at Commerzbank. </p> <p>'People have been selling technology stocks in the indiscriminate way they were buying last autumn. The euro tech baby is being thrown out with the US bath water. But our message is \"don't panic\". Europe is holding up. ARM's results were good, Alcatel has made a positive statement and Misys, too.' </p> <p>He pointed out that the US technology industry relies heavily on personal computers while in Europe there is a bias towards mobile and digital technology. That, he believes, should shield us from the US market's troubles. </p> <p>Others are less convinced. One strategist pointed to the telecoms sector, where debts have raced ahead even faster than share prices, as particularly vulnerable. Its inflated valuations are predicated on mobiles taking over from PCs as the preferred method of accessing the internet. But the technology is so new that it is impossible to judge whether that will be true. </p> <p>Banking regulators and corporate bond holders are starting to get nervous about the amount of money being gambled on the theory. The drop in the price of companies such as Vodafone suggests that investors are not quite as certain about it as they were. That does not mean they are baling out completely but they are keeping an eye on the calender and will breathe a sigh of relief when October ends.</p>",
  "<p>We have all heard a lot about oil recently. Growth, inflation, American presidential hopes and UK prime ministerial ones have all been linked to the price of crude. </p> <p>During the demonstrations against duty and VAT on fuel, the Government gave the oil barons a dressing down in Downing Street and blamed the motorists' pain on the soaring global oil price. </p> <p>But drivers are less aware that the price of fuel for their homes has shot up nearly as fast as that for their vehicles. Why? Because bills hitting the doormats are still effectively capped by the regulator Ofgem and not directly linked to the wholesale price of gas. A great relief to the Government. </p> <p>But one group is taking a lot of notice - industry. The Energy Intensive Users' Group, representing such industries as glass and steelmaking, says forward prices for industrial contracts in the coming year have doubled - adding 12p a therm - and its members face an extra energy bill of nearly \u00a3500 billion next year. </p> <p>The fortunes of users and suppliers could not be more different. The rate of return for North Sea operators was 31.1 per cent in the second quarter of this year - a two- decade high. </p> <p> Meanwhile, manufacturing returns fell from 6.1 per cent to 6 per cent, lower than at any time since recessionary 1993. </p> <p>Manufacturers and the users' group are well organised lobbies - and the Chancellor has made his views of lobbies very clear. The plight of manufacturers is as nothing compared with the outrage of car-driving Middle England. </p> <p>Nevertheless, last week the gas market came under Government scrutiny. Callum McCarthy, head of Ofgem, ordered an inquiry into price-fixing by North Sea operators, who stand accused of manipulating gas prices so they spike upwards, increasing volatility and the price of forward contracts. </p> <p>McCarthy has already held one inquiry this year. It exonerated the companies - but highlighted another equally acute problem for industry. The UK market in gas supply and the break-up of British Gas into monopoly network operator Transco and supplier Centrica, has allowed stand-alone gas prices to emerge. In non-deregulated Europe oil is a proxy - and so prices have rocketed. </p> <p>Thanks to an interconnector pipeline with Europe, opened in 1998, UK prices have shot up as British producers and European traders have sucked huge volumes across to take advantage of the price differential. Gas users say this increases the power of companies that have consolidated into pan-European giants, benefiting from high UK as well as high European prices. </p> <p>But there are other unexplained factors behind price rises. The suspicion prompting Ofgem's renewed investigation is that gas shippers - pipeline operators - are manipulating their commitments to deliver a certain volume each day. Transco requires it to be sent in at a constant rate but shippers vary this, causing bunching of supply. Transco has to buy or sell to balance it. There are four results: 1) Transco spends millions in the spot market, leading to 2) greater volatility and 3) higher futures prices which 4) delights oil and gas companies. </p> <p>Traders and industry say Ofgem should investigate all supply practices, including the interconnector, and name and shame the culpable companies. </p> <p>Ofgem believes the system should be monitored every hour rather than each day, and that the guilty should compensate Transco - although this alone would not remove the incentive to manipulate the forward price. </p> <p>McCarthy has his eye on April, when price controls are removed. If the prices now hitting industry feed into contracts for domestic users, Middle England will be outraged. </p> <p>Unless there is a dramatic fall in the oil price, naming and shaming and speedy reform may be the only way to avert a new crisis. On the other hand, it wouldn't be as much fun as hearing what Blair had to say to the oilmen at a reconvened Downing Street summit in the spring.</p>",

Parnell, David Kaff, Tony Hendra </p> <p> Zhang Yimou, who made his reputation with Red Sorghum, Ju Dou, Raise the Red Lantern and Shanghai Triad, four of the Chinese cinema's most aesthetically elegant movies, has deliberately turned his back on anything resembling Hollywood-style technical sophistication. In an attempt to revive neo-realism and match the current work of Iranian filmmakers, he's made two simple, low-budget movies, Not One Less and <strong> The Road Home</strong>, both celebrating the lives of honest peasants and centring on teachers. </p> <p>The title of The Road Home has several meanings. In the present (shot in a cold, blue-tinged monochrome), Luo, a successful young businessman, returns for the first time in years to his remote native village to attend the funeral of his father, a revered primary school teacher. The father died in hospital some distance away and his mother is determined that his body should be carried back home through the snow by a party of mourners according to ancient tradition, borne along the road which first brought him to the village. </p> <p>In an extended flashback, shot in soft, nostalgic colour, we see the father's arrival 40 years ago and his courtship of the now elderly mother, who was then the village beauty. This was during the idealistic early days of the Revolution when there was no electricity or running water, but a great deal of hope. Now there are modern conveniences, but the young leave for the city, and on the wall beside a traditional print is the Chinese poster for James Cameron's Titanic. It's a sentimental, warm-hearted movie, calculatedly simple, that celebrates love in a cold political climate, the consolations of community, the power of education, and the small things in life. </p> <p>The gap between The Road Home and <strong> Road Trip</strong> is greater than the width of the Pacific Ocean. This is the latest Farrelly-inspired comedy, an example of the New Vulgarity that makes Animal House look as reserved as Coward's Hay Fever. The plot turns on a student at Ithaca in upper New York State accidentally sending his girlfriend at the University of Texas, Austin, a video of himself having sex with a co-ed instead of the intended innocuous love letter. So with four assorted chums, whose all-encompassing interests are drugs, booze, partying and sex, he drives south to retrieve it. Along the way they steal a bus from a blind school, sell sperm to a fertility clinic, get high with a senior citizen who has a permanent erection induced by Viagra, and one of them loses his virginity to a gargantuan black girl in Tennessee. It is just possible that Road Trip is setting out to parody the genre, and Tom Green is very funny as its unreliable narrator. </p> <p><strong> Dinosaur</strong> is the Disney Studio's latest animated movie combining live-action footage and computer-generated imagery to tell the tale of a herd of prehistoric monsters making an epic journey across difficult terrain to their idyllic nesting grounds. Technically it's astonishing. Dramatically, it's dire. The original screenplay is by Walon Green, screenwriter on The Wild Bunch and The Hi-Lo Country, and is in effect a re-working of Red River with the Montgomery Clift role going to a thoughtful young iguanadon called Aladar, and John Wayne's tough leader becoming the bull-headed leader, Kron. Socially these creatures, along with a family of chatty monkeys that accompany them, have evolved beyond anything Darwin could have imagined, indeed beyond Darwin himself. They all talk and act exactly like twenty-first century Californian suburbanites. </p> <p>The ferocious Dinosaur and the mild <strong> Tom's Midnight Garden</strong> both feature Joan Plowright. As a half-term treat, kids are likely to thank you for taking them to the former, and to make life tough for you should you inflict on them the latter. This is a screen version of Philippa Pearce's classic fantasy, published more than 40 years ago, about a middle-class lad travelling through time to meet a little orphan girl in a Victorian country house outside Ely. There are touching and magical moments, but generally it's overlong, confused, repetitive, oddly dislocated, and not a patch on the cherished book. </p> <p>The directorial debut of the excellent Polish-Ameri can cinematographer Andrzej Bartkowiak, <strong> Romeo Must Die</strong>, is a vehicle for Chinese martial arts star Jet Li, who made his American debut two years ago as the heavy in Lethal Weapon 4 . Here he plays a wrongly imprisoned Hong Kong cop who escapes to avenge the death of his brother, killed in an interracial gang war in Oakland. The choreography is better than the scenario. </p> <p>Rob Reiner's 1983 directorial debut, a murderously accurate parody of a cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 -style rockumentary about a disintegrating British rock band on their last US tour, is back in cinemas, looking and sounding better than ever. The accents are impeccable and Reiner is hilarious as a bearded movie-brat director. In the past 17 years, the movie has developed a cult following and accreted its own legend. This is recorded in the accompanying <strong> This Is Spinal Tap</strong>: The Official Companion (Bloomsbury \u00a316.99) which contains a prepilogue by Michael McKean (who plays David St Hubbins), the script, a Tap'istory, the band's lyrics, and a 185-page A-Z guide to the movie full of extraordinary, often arcane, information. I should declare an interest here or, more correctly, admit a responsibility, because the A-Z is by Karl French, whom I forced to attend cinemas on a regular basis between the ages of four and 19, when he saw the press show of This Is Spinal Tap and left home for good. </p> <p>Had I not done so, or had the experience worked as aversion therapy, he might now be a prison warder, a spin doctor, a futures trader, or following some other socially useful calling.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Merce Cunningham Dance Company</strong> Barbican, London EC2 <br><strong> Random Dance Company</strong> Greenwich Dance Agency, SE10 </p> <p> John Cage defined choreography as the art of moving without bumping into anything unless you mean to. <strong> Merce Cunningham</strong> (who paid tribute to Cage after the composer's death by standing still for 4mins 33secs) is content with that Cowardly dictum. At the Barbican, dancers bumped into Andy Warhol's helium balloons (in RainForest, 1968) and let electronically animated figures bump into them (in Biped, 1999). </p> <p>Cunningham, now 81, has found his way round the obstacle of his arthritis by using virtual dancers to work out his choreography. He no longer needs to demonstrate what he wants. He experiments instead with LifeForms software, testing his ideas on the computer screen before transposing them on to real-life performers. The dances thus created are unpredictable, bizarrely beautiful - but then, so is his pre-computer choreography, as RainForest and Summerspace (1958) testified. </p> <p> Summerspace is a Cunningham primer. He lets you see the architecture of the piece, without ornamentation. It is based simply on stepping: giant paces, lunges, linked chan\u00e9 turns. The dancers hold still as though their bare feet were suckers, gripping the stage. Then, like Robert Rauschenberg's dotty designs, they float off into space. </p> <p> RainForest is far stranger. Its six flesh-coloured inhabitants move as arbitrarily as the silver-foil pillows drifting about them. Robert Swinston has the feral alertness of a forest creature; Jeannie Steele coils like a liana. They leap without preparation, as though their in-between moves had been elided by a video-maker or computer programmer. </p> <p>For Biped , digital designers Shelley Eshkar and Paul Kaiser created a decor of light illusions. These must be the most precisely tailored designs Cunningham has ever commissioned. Bars of light contribute to the fluid architecture of the piece, expanding and contracting the space in which the dancers move. Spectral figures stride in mid-air, performing the same choreography as the solid bodies below. They are in fact the same bodies, etherealised through motion capture. </p> <p>Light-sensitive sensors were attached to two dancers' limbs, whose movements were recorded digitally. The sketchy outlines thus generated are not so much computer fantasies as 3-D phantoms of real people. Perhaps because they are so ephemeral, their presence is far less distracting than film or video images. You soon learn to see through them in order to focus on the extraordinary shapes the flesh-and-blood dancers make. </p> <p>Soloists are multiplied, mirrored, refracted by their fellows. They could be children at play, haunted by ghosts, or iridescent insects. Unlike lucid Summerspace, Biped 's logic is fuzzy: nothing is as simple as it seems. Variations on themes unravel and are knitted up again. Gavin Bryars's luscious score is sometimes sepulchral, sometimes ecstatic. By the end, a requiem has been celebrated. </p> <p>Wayne McGregor invites comparison with Cunningham by appearing in the same Dance Umbrella week and taking part, today, in a live chat room (at the ICA and at <a href=\"http://www.danceumbrella.co.uk/virtual\">www.danceumbrella.co.uk/virtual</a> with digital artists. Yet McGregor and his <strong> Random Dance Company</strong> are working towards a different relationship with electronic space. In The Trilogy Installation, he aims to take the audience, seated in the Greenwich Borough Hall or at home in front of their computers, into a virtual environment. He and his dancers can seem sci-fi mutants, morphed out of the ether. </p> <p>The 70-minute performance combines sections of three works made between 1997 and 2000. McGregor's choreography and use of technology have grown more sophisticated over the years, so that the computer animations no longer mask a lack of structure in the dances. At first, noisy, high-adrenaline action pummels the senses into submission; then overlapping images of worker-ant clones propose a novel kind of group dynamics. </p> <p>Finally, pure dance dominates. Aeon, the last of the trilogy, has no need of the light show that now accompanies it. Timo Arnall's graphic creation, a whirling, pulsing jellyfish, is even more amazing than Biped 's virtual dancers. But McGregor's real discovery is that he can choreograph for bodies not his own - and that other people, rather than digital programmes, can offer him new possibilities.</p>",
  "<p>Zac Goldsmith is a little late getting to the Ecologist' s offices, a utility shell in the lee of the Chelsea power station, so I take a seat on a sofa of ancient, Sloaney provenance: a sofa that, it occurs, might just be a cast-off from the family home, Ormeley Lodge, and might thus have received the imprint of some very influential bottoms indeed. Around me, the Ecologist 's tiny editorial team (two, this morning) are sitting tapping away at keyboards by the acid light of long-life bulbs. Staff are clearly more preoccupied with saving the planet than doing the cleaning: surfaces are covered with grime and unwashed cups, and the loo is very, ahem, ecological indeed. And there, chucked on the floor next to the bog roll, is some reading matter: a copy of Private Eye, the magazine with which Zac's papa, the late Sir James Goldsmith, had such a nasty dust-up. </p> <p>Zac, as editor of the Ecologist for the last three years, is also enthusiastic about litigation. He itches to be sued. The targets on which the magazine has slapped its cross hairs - such as Monsanto, Wal-Mart and most recently the big cancer charities - are, he claims, forever threatening him with legal action and, 'I always write back, because I know what we're saying is accurate, saying, \"We'd be happy to lend you financial assistance if you want to pursue this line in the courts.\" In other words, we'd love you to sue us. Anytime.' So far, to his disappointment, no one has bitten. 'This is not a hobby magazine, it's not passive or objective. It's a campaign tool.' </p> <p>He believes that his father, who died in 1997, was unwise to tackle Private Eye. 'Probably that was a rash thing to do... he certainly gave it a lot more prominence. But from what I know, and I quite enjoy Private Eye, they really did go for him, and it went on and on. So I'm not sure I blame him. I'm not sure how well I'd bear up under that. Actually, come to think of it, unless it was totally dishonest, I wouldn't really care.' </p> <p>Zac, who gave up smoking cigarettes six months ago when his daughter Uma was born, produces a battered-looking cigar butt, while his labrador-cross Tashi, obtained from Battersea Dogs' Home, settles in the corner, gazing at him with all the starry-eyed devotion of a hound on a medieval knight's tomb. The cigar is jammed, unlit, in the corner of his mouth: it's a difficult look, unless you hail from Little Italy or Wall Street, but he pulls it off. Of course he pulls it off. Zac may only be 25, but he has as much aplomb as cash. And he has shedloads of cash. Somewhere between \u00a310 million and \u00a3100m, or so I've read. 'The prime purpose of money for me personally is to enable me to do what I'm doing now,' says Zac, who says these estimates are either 'conservative' or 'wildly over the top'. 'If I didn't have any money, I'd be working in order to do this - and I'd want as much as possible.' </p> <p>The Ecologist was founded 30 years ago by his uncle, Edward Goldsmith. To help it though a recent relaunch, Zac sank a stack of his own money into it, and has never drawn a salary. 'Next year I hope it will even out a bit. Possibly go into the black,' he says, giving the impression that he doesn't care too much either way. This is not the approach of his father, the controversial corporate buccaneer who left an estimated fortune of \u00a31.5 billion (and eight children by various wives and mistresses) when he died of pancreatic cancer in 1997. Zac, whose mother is Lady Annabel Goldsmith and whose older sister Jemima is married to Imran Khan, may have the second generation's financial insouciance, but he does have his father's drive, irreverence and unpre dictability. In his inky cords and old cashmere jersey, with tousled hair and angular good looks, he may be living the boho trustafarian dream - but he is, without question, putting his money where his mouth is. </p> <p>There were rumbles of dissatisfaction from the green lobby when his uncle appointed him editor. It was certainly a stunning career trajectory. After being expelled from Eton at 17 for smoking dope, and picking up A-levels at a Cambridge crammer, Zac went on an extended year off (travelling in the Himalayas and California, where he worked on a river project). He had only recently returned to the UK when, following an enormous row, most of the Ecologist 's editorial team stormed out. 'A cynic would probably say that I'd knocked everyone off in the course of a week, removed all obstacles and created the Ecologist empire,' he says, drily. 'That's not the way it happened, though. </p> <p>'The point about nepotism: sure, if I wasn't Teddy's nephew, it wouldn't have ended up in my lap, but all that does is ensure I put my arse into it. If I discovered tomorrow that I was doing a bad job, I'd leave - simple as that. It's not an ego trip because I know my life is devoted to these issues. How I choose to stay involved is up for grabs. In 10 years' time, I might be an eco terrorist. But I'll take the most effective path, whatever that is.' </p> <p>The editorial tone of the magazine has become excitingly pyrotechnic under his stewardship. Zac - who loathes Blair ('Wouldn't trust him with my dog. Wouldn't trust him with my budgerigar') and Hague ('I'd have to drug myself before I voted for him. Get drunk beforehand. And then wash myself afterwards') equally - is keen to spice things up a bit. He expresses satisfaction that there are two anti-Ecologist websites up at the moment, one accusing it of being Stalinist, the other Hitlerite. 'To me, that's a huge compliment.' </p> <p>Politically, his father is still a major influence, and not just because Zac is also ardently opposed to the single currency. Sir James, who underwent an ecological conversion towards the end of his life, may have started off as a fervent free-marketeer, but 'as he grew older he began to realise that there were so many subsidies that the free market was artificially slanted in favour of big business - it wasn't a free market at all.' In Zac's opinion, 'if there's one solution to the mess we're all in, it's buying local, producing for local consumption, and reducing the distance between producer and consumer. That cuts out so many of the environmental problems.' So he is a passionate supporter of small rural communities. Recently, that prompted him to stick a pro-hunting piece in the magazine. 'A lot of people cancelled their subscriptions. But my interest is in attracting readers who are willing to debate these things, otherwise we'll all grow fat and lazy. If that message is unsaleable, then so be it.' </p> <p>That's the money talking. But then, there is something unworldly about Zac, a strange foil to his magnificent apocalyptic zeal ('The world is so ugly now, so mutilated. I get very gloomy thinking about what I've brought my daughter into'). I've read that he traces his interest in the environment back to the age of nine when he converted a chicken run in the garden into a large and luxurious budgie sanctuary. </p> <p>'That story,' says Zac, puzzled. 'There is truth to that, but I'm just amazed that such a flippant story is reprinted every time the Ecologist is mentioned.' </p> <p>Oh, come off it. As a journalist himself, he has to see the comic potential of the words 'budgie' and 'sanctuary'. </p> <p>'I suppose so,' he says uncertainly. 'Actually, sanctuary's a very grand word for it. It was like an old-age people's home for budgerigars.' The staff at the petshop told him he couldn't keep hard-beaked and soft-billed birds together because they'd kill each other: 'There were all these rules and regulations and it seemed ridiculous. So I thought if it was big enough and as wild as possible, with nettles and bushes and a pear tree, then they'd all get on. And it is pretty harmonious.' </p> <p>Like his father, Zac has always viewed rules with a lordly contempt. He and his wife Sheherazade, the daughter of an asset-stripper and the socialite/PR Viviane Ventura who once wrote her own Guide to Social Climbing , were married last year. (At the Ritz reception, everything was organic, including the wedding cake and the vodka.) They have since bought a farm near Tavistock, and hope to be self-sufficient within five years. It may sound fairly Petit Hameau, but Zac takes it very seriously. 'If the magazine collapsed, if the world was going to self-destruct, I would just sink my hands into the mud and live like a pig. Not in a negative sense,' he adds quickly. 'I mean, I love pigs.' Last week he bought himself a Gloucester Old Spot. He's keen to get involved in the Devon farming scene, though he knows that he'll be an outsider until he's 80. His uncle lived in Cornwall for 20 years, 'and he was always that eccentric Jew on the hill'. </p> <p>Sheherazade is about to launch an organic deli in Battersea, but Zac says the produce grown on the Devon farm will not be suitable, partly because she wants to use local suppliers, and partly because he plans to flout the EU agricultural regulations wherever possible. 'If I want to move one of my sheep from my field to a neighbour's, I have to make a formal report to MAFF and send them the passport of this individual sheep. These rules are mad. They're designed to kill the small producers.' </p> <p>Mr and Mrs Goldsmith take the train to Devon, although (Zac points out) they travel from Exeter to the farm by car because there is no local bus. He and his wife do their best to pop Uma into flannel nappies, but these are proving a bit of a nightmare. In other words, it's a struggle to be green, no matter how many millions you have. </p> <p>The ecological movement, he says, is very good at making people feel guilty, 'and I don't think that's fair. I can choose to walk to work, where to buy my food. I'm in a very lucky position. Ninety-nine per cent of people can't choose - they're just lucky to get a bloody job. And if their local shop has been out-competed, then they have to get into their car and drive to the out-of-town supermarket. Before we start pointing our fingers, we have to encourage policy-makers to create an infrastructure which can accommodate an ecological lifestyle.' He sticks the butt back in his mouth and chomps on it: Sir James's son, but someone else as well.</p>",
  "<p>Your credit card will cost you nothing if you always pay off your bill in full every month. True or false? </p> <p>The answer is not as clear- cut as you might think. It should be true once you rule out cards where you can't avoid paying an annual fee, such as the Blue and Green Amex credit cards, the Capital Bank Sterling Visa and Frizzell Bank's Mastercard and Visa cards. </p> <p>Even then, there's no escaping charges if you have one that charges interest whether or not you clear your bill. Cards with no interest-free period can be a good deal if you run a debt. But cards carrying no free credit - such as the Alliance and Leicester Diamond card, the Bank of Scotland One Visa, the Co-op Advantage Visa, Halifax Visa Balance, Hamilton Direct Bank Visa, and Lloyds TSB Asset Advance Mastercards - are a very bad deal if you clear your balance regularly. Unless the issuer warns you that you would be better off with a different card, as Alliance &amp; Leicester does, you'll be stuck paying interest every month. </p> <p>Nor will your card be free if you use it to get cash, which includes using the cheques given with some cards. The least you will pay on a cash advance of \u00a3100, repaid in full within a month, is the 48p interest charged by Lombard Direct - and even then, only in the first six months. After that, the cost would rise to \u00a31.24. Nationwide's flat fee of 50p, or 0.5 per cent of the amount withdrawn if this is greater, would be better. Others, such as Nationwide, don't charge full payers interest on cash withdrawals - a minimum charge of between \u00a31.50 and \u00a32 is more common. Cash costs more with cards that charge interest as well as a fee. The most expensive is the Budgens Visa card where a \u00a3100 cash advance could cost nearly \u00a37. </p> <p>And don't think that your card will cost nothing if you use it only to buy things. It might if all your spending is in the UK, but - unless you have a Nationwide card - it won't be once you're abroad. If you have a Liverpool Victo ria card there's no extra charge for purchases within the European Union. But those made elsewhere incur the Visa network's foreign usage loading: 1 per cent of the value of each transaction. Other issuers like to make a bit on top of the network charge, and typically add between 2 and 2.75 per cent to worldwide shopping. </p> <p>So is the only way out to be a full-paying stay-at-home who never withdraws cash? It helps if you are a model customer, too. You won't have to pay Barclaycard, HSBC or Liverpool Victoria if you go over your credit limit, pay your bill late (or pay on time with a cheque or direct debit that bounces) or add to their work in other ways.But most other firms punish such transgressions with a penalty fee of between \u00a35 and \u00a330 (see table). If you burden them further by asking for copies of statements or transaction slips, you could pay between \u00a32 and \u00a310 for each piece of paper. </p> <p>The greatest risk of penalties is with Alliance &amp; Leicester, Direct Line, Egg and the Woolwich, whose cards give you only 15 days to pay your bill from the statement date. </p> <p>With most others, paying within 25 days will avoid a lateness fee. But for full payers wanting to avoid interest as well, a 15-day deadline applies with the Co-op Bank, Northern Rock and Smile. </p> <p>However, you can avoid worry about fees or interest charges by making full payments by direct debit. This is possible with all except American Express, Capital One, Northern Rock and RBS Advanta, which accept such payments only for the minimum amount.</p>"
