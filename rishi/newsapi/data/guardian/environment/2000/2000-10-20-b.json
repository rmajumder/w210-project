  "<p>Everyone puts together a personal checklist when they go house hunting, whether it is a south-facing garden, period features, utility room or cellar. But how many people make a mental note to check the likely impact of global warming on their chosen residence? </p> <p>Environmental experts say that soon more and more of us will be assessing the chances of flood damage on our prospective homes. With many people in the UK still on flood watch, the Environment Agency said 5m people live in flood-risk areas and the prospect of being engulfed in water is now a fact of daily life in England and Wales. The agency says flood reports have doubled in the last 100 years. </p> <p>Climate change means residents could see up to a \"10-fold increase in flood risk over the next century. A typical flood that might now happen on average once in 100 years could occur as frequently as every 10 or 20 years in future. In short, today's extreme floods could become tomorrow's norm,\" the agency adds. </p> <p>The floods that swept through the south-east last month are offered as proof of the seriousness of the situation. The floods, the worst in 40 years, forced residents in East Sussex and Kent from their homes and businesses when rivers broke their banks. </p> <p>Lewes was stranded when the River Ouse overflowed. Hundreds of homes in the Kentish villages of Yalding, Wateringbury, East Farleigh, Laddingford and East Peckham were also flood when the Medway and its tributaries burst their banks. </p> <p>When the water subsides householders surveying the wreckage might find it hard to believe their home isn't blighted and impossible to sell. However, a spokesman from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors says all is not lost. </p> <p>\"Homeowners shouldn't have any problems selling a house that has been properly dried out and had the electrics and gas checked,\" he says. But if buyers know the area has been flooded in the past it may have an effect on the value of the property. </p> <p>Ever the optimists, estate agents deny that the floods will have an impact on property prices in the area. A spokesman for Hoskin, a Crawley-based agent that covers the area where some of the worst flooding occurred, said that Lewes in East Sussex would continue to be a desirable place to live. \"There is a relatively limited supply of property and a lot of people want to live there,\" he said. </p> <p>Residents of towns like Lewes, built many years ago on spots vulnerable to flooding, have little choice but to weather whatever nature sends them. But with 3m homes planned for the south-east by 2016 there are growing concerns about where developers are siting new developments. </p> <p>Earlier this month, the Association of British Insurers (ABI) published research into the potential impact of inland flooding. </p> <p>It is not surprising that the insurers want to cut the number of homes at risk from flooding - after all, the industry found itself meeting a \u00a312m bill for the damage caused by floods in Yorkshire and County Durham in June. In recent weeks there have been hints at premium hikes unless more care is taken over homes in vulnerable areas. </p> <p>Insurers have called for a halt to all developments on flood plains or for improved drainage and specially designed buildings. In response the government has promised tighter guidance and stronger powers for local authorities to prevent homes being built in particularly risky areas. </p> <p>For ordinary homes, RICS says most materials should dry out with the help of dehumidifiers. Brickwork, concrete, timber in good condition and plaster should all survive a soaking. Plasterboard, chipboard and plywood, on the other hand, are unlikely to survive. </p> <p>Floods are not bad news for everyone. Sussex police warned that cowboy builders were launching their own brand of clean-up operation, exploiting flood-stricken homeowners. RICS urges res idents to take advice from insurers or a professional such as a surveyor to determine the extent of the damage and the remedies needed. </p> <p>The Environment Agency urges householders in risk areas to be prepared by taking some commonsense precautions. Keep a list of useful numbers to hand, including the floodline, 0845-988-1188. </p> <p>Have sandbags or floorboards available to block doorways and airbricks. Make up a flood kit including torch, blankets, waterproof clothing, wellingtons and key personal documents. Consider a flood plan and discuss it with your family or neighbours. Make sure you know how to switch off gas and electricity. Think about where you would move your pets and your car and get into the habit of storing valuables upstairs or high up. </p> <p>After flooding, the Buildings Research Establishment recommends householders check for structural damage, check gas and electricity supplies are off and whether drainage is working, photograph the damage, contact insurers and remove wet carpets and fur niture. Clean walls and floors and open windows and doors to start the drying process. </p> <p>Although experts are reluctant to blame the recent floods entirely on global warming, climatic changes in general are giving the Environment Agency more than a little cause for concern. It hopes, with the help of an advertising campaign, that it can persuade householders to take the risk just as seriously. </p> <p>Insurers: <a href=\"http://www.abi.org.uk\">www.abi.org.uk;</a> </p> <p>Environment Agency: <a href=\"http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk\">environment-agency.gov.uk</a> the environment agency.gov.uk.

  "<p>Ten years ago, the squeeze started on students when the Conservatives froze grants and introduced student loans. New Labour meant new costs for undergraduates - grants have now disappeared and annual fees add to the financial burden. </p> <p>While all parents can dream of the proud moment of their child's graduation, the post-graduation debt can be a ball and chain, and one that is likely to grow heavier. </p> <p>The Association of Investment Trust Companies estimates that a three-year course could now carry a price tag of up to \u00a320,000. Parents who want to pay the bill will have to be wealthy enough to fund annual costs approaching \u00a37,000 or save up while their child is younger. The flexibility, relatively low costs and diversification benefits of investment trusts makes them an excellent way for far-sighted parents to reduce the handicapping effects of student debt. </p> <p>Since investment trusts typically offer a portfolio of 50 or more companies the investment is likely to grow gradually in line with the stock market rather than at the whim of investors in an individual company's shares. </p> <p>Their low costs mean the investor gains more of benefits of the investment. And they are flexible enough to allow the investor to decide whether to make a one-off lump-sum payment (perhaps of several thousand pounds) or ongoing regular savings (of perhaps a few hundred pounds a month). </p> <p>Different investment trust shares have different levels of risk and these can be selected and combined to most efficiently achieve the investment target. For example, zero dividend preference shares of investment trusts offer a very low-risk way to grow capital over a given period of time. </p> <p>At present an investor who buys a zero can expect to gain an average annual return of perhaps 8%, entirely in the form of capital gains, which can be offset by his or her capital gains tax allowance - investors are allowed to make \u00a37,200 a year in capital gains without tax liability. But since zeros are very low-risk investments the returns are not outstandingly high. </p> <p>These may suit parents who have a reasonable amount to invest and can achieve their target with modest returns. Or they may suit parents with only a short period until their child heads for academia and who are more interested in growing the amount of money they can provide in support but are unwilling to assume much risk. </p> <p>Alternatively, for parents with a slightly longer timeframe or those willing to take on slightly more risk, well-diversified global investment trusts might be ideal. Trusts such as Foreign &amp; Colonial and Witan have an enviable record for providing steady and respectable growth over reasonable periods of time without too much risk. </p> <p>Edinburgh Fund Managers believe that the need for the young people of today to finance their student days plus the lessons in basic personal finance added to the national curriculum will make children more financially astute than their parents. It has a special InvestIT plan aimed at children. </p> <p>For parents who can make do without spending the child benefit, Edinburgh suggests using it to fund a savings plan. </p> <p>\"Over the long term - and for a young child going eventually to higher education we might be talking 15 years - higher returns could be achieved from investment trusts than bank accounts,\" says Edinburgh's Lesley Drummond. </p> <p>\"Child benefit is over \u00a360 a month for the first child and is paid until 16 but is extended if the child is still at school or equivalent.\" </p> <p>Over 15 years, a \u00a362.40 monthly contribution (the current child benefit for the first child) would have produced \u00a332,443 in the middle of the road Edinburgh Investment Trust - almost double the \u00a317,427 from top-paying building society accounts. </p> <p>The scheme costs nothing other than stamp duty, although there is an \u00a311.75 fee for withdrawals. It can be stopped without penalty if conditions change - or if investors want to put their money elsewhere. </p> <p>And the fund managers will set up a trust account free of charge so that the money will be made available when the child reaches university age. </p> <p> David Smith is investment funds editor at <a href=\"http://www.citywire.co.uk\">www.citywire.co.uk</a></p> <p> <strong>Case study: New home for child benefit</strong></p> <p>Electronics engineer Alan Graham (right) decided to go for a higher risk when he switched the family's child benefit from helping to pay the grocery bill to a long-term investment trust savings plan. </p> <p>\"I sent off for a free booklet on investing for children from Flemings. I liked the idea of their investment trust savings scheme because it was very flexible,\" says Alan, 44, from Lancaster. </p> <p>The family's child benefit is worth around \u00a3100 a month so Alan has split the money between Jack, six, and Tom, three. \"The idea is that I keep saving at this level until they reach 18.\" </p> <p>And because Alan, who has shares of his own but no investment trusts, is looking at a minimum of 12 years, he is willing to go up a notch or two up the risk scale by investing in the 250 biggest companies outside the Footsie index. </p> <p>\"I'm hoping that investing \u00a39,000 for each boy over the next decade will turn into \u00a315,000,\" he says. \"If it doubles I'll be really pleased.\"</p>",
  "<p>Freeserve, Britain's dominant internet service provider, was last night ejected from the FTSE 100, the index of Britain's leading companies. </p> <p>Since March, Freeserve's valuation has fallen from \u00a310bn to \u00a31.6bn. Its plight reflects a wider malaise that Merrill Lynch says has wiped more than $50bn (\u00a335bn) off the value of Europe's listed internet companies since the start of September. </p> <p>Britain's high-profile consumer-focused internet companies have been at the centre of the bloodbath. Online auctioneer QXL.com's value fell from \u00a32.6bn to \u00a399m as its shares slid from 800p in April to last night's low of 27p. </p> <p>Lastminute.com has fallen from its high of 487.5p and 380p issue price to 132p. </p> <p>Shares in Interactive Investor International (iii), the online personal finance firm, are worth just 47.5p, effectively a third of their issue price and a tenth of their March high. </p> <p>365 Corporation, the content and telecoms company that floated in a blaze of publicity a year ago, wallows at a fifth of its March high at 60.5p. The shares were issued at 160p. </p> <p>\"From the peak the decline in prices has been nothing short of brutal,\" said Peter Bradshaw, internet analyst at Merrill Lynch. </p> <p>Several factors have influenced the selling and the performance of the technology laden Nasdaq index in the US has, as ever, set the tone. </p> <p>In macroeconomic terms concerns about a slowing of the global economy, signs of inflation and a tightening of credit had a big impact on valuations. When credit was cheaper and inflation lower, the appetite to back emerging, and more risky, technology stocks was greater. </p> <p>The market capitalisations of blue-chip internet stocks such as Yahoo!, Amazon and eBay have been radically revised as observers started to question their long-term revenue prospects. </p> <p>Priceline.com, for example, trades at a 20th of its March price and its business model appears to be in tatters. The Nasdaq composite has fallen more than 20% since September 20. </p> <p>\"The US market has been friendless for the past six months,\" Mr Bradshaw said. </p> <p>The saying that when Nasdaq sneezes technology stocks around the globe become flu cases has never been more apt. </p> <p>There are other influences at work in Britain. The collapse of the likes of Boo.com, Boxman and ClickMango hardly helped sentiment. Institutional investors appear to have deserted many UK internet stocks. \"In this sort of environment you look for companies with visible earnings and cash flow,\" said one analyst at another major investment bank. </p> <p>\"If you are a fund manager you don't want to have to explain to your investors why you're sitting on some dot.com shares that are a mile under water. OK, at these levels they may double but equally they may halve again and it's not worth the risk.\" </p> <p>The relentless selling of QXL.com shows how sentiment can destroy a stock and how little there is underpinning the shares. Earlier in the year it was confidently using its high share price to drive consolidation in the internet auction space and was on the way to becoming a credible rival to eBay. But when its share price collapsed so did its acquisition strategy. </p> <p>Analysts say its share price has probably fallen too far but if it remains there the company will not be able to raise the cash it needs to take it through to profitability. eBay could let the shares fall further then pick up QXL at a bargain price. </p> <p>As Lastminute.com has shown, a share price can continue to fall even if the business plan is being executed ahead of expectations and there is enough money to see the venture through to profitability. Freeserve faces similar issues. Motivating staff whose own share options are almost valueless is an added difficulty. </p> <p>Merrill Lynch believes some of the thousands of private investors sitting on big paper losses could yet get their money back. \"There is a light at the end of the tunnel for some of these companies but the trend for the next few months is likely to be flat or downwards,\" Mr Bradshaw said. </p> <p>For others, the internet boom will have been a painful investment lesson.</p>",

Instead, he was landed with a Freedom of Information Act which could pass Lord Irvine's scrutiny; when it did, to general acclaim, it was too late to cancel his execution; his pre-election achievement of a multi-lateralist consensus was also under-estimated.</a></p> <p><a name=\"f\">Eurosceptic, pro-NATO, basically an environmentalist crusader, badger-protector, footpath-bulldozer and libertarian rambler who made green issues sexy.</a></p> <p><a name=\"f\"><b>Traits:</b> Blond, retreating hair; genial; earnest; dedicated; worthy; hardworking</a></p> <p><a name=\"f\"><b>History:</b>Joined Labour party 1959; won Colne Valley from Liberal Richard Wainwright June 1970; lost it February 1974; elected for South Shields 1979; quietly resigned as deputy spokesman on defence because his views were not in keeping with those of the Labour party nationally; named spokesman on the environment November 1986; named chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster in the cabinet office, with responsibility for open government, May 1997; was sacked from the cabinet, blaming it on his insistence on living in the north east and missing out on the London cocktail circuit, July 1998</a></p> <p><a name=\"f\"> </a><a name=\"g\"><b>Sir Patrick Cormack, 61, Conservative MP for South Staffordshire</b> <br></a></p> <p><a name=\"g\"><b>Majority:</b> 7,821 over Labour</a></p> <p><a name=\"g\"><b>Seat:</b> Staffordshire South (since 1983, former seats Staffordshire SW 1974-83; Cannock 1970-74) A safe Tory suburbanised seat on the edge of the west Midlands, formerly rural</a></p> <p><a name=\"g\"><b>Outlook:</b> Shrewd, rebellious centrist; \"one of the finest parliamentarians\" (Michael White, The Guardian); was among the first Conservatives to realise how completely they had lost middle England over their greed, incompetence, incessant quarrels over Europe and by moving too far to the right; a mainstream traditionalist; a monarchist loyal to the Prince of Wales; orotund of figure and speech; a churchy leader of the sanctimony school; a canny fighter for old buildings, historic buildings, the genteel of modest means, Euro-enthusiast</a></p> <p><a name=\"g\"><b>Traits:</b> Rotund, owlish, fruity-voiced, \"the air of the people who say sshh to you in public galleries\" (Matthew Parris, The Times)</a></p> <p><a name=\"g\"><b>History:</b> Joined Young Conservatives at 16, 1955; overturned Jennie Lee's 11,000 majority to win Cannock, 1970; seconded Peter Lilley for the Conservative leadership, May 1997; was named deputy shadow leader of the Commons, June 1997; opposed proposals of new Commons leader Ann Taylor to clear out many old commons customs, possibly allowing clapping, August 1997</a></p> <p><a name=\"h\"> <b>Sir Alan Haselhurst, 63, Conservative MP for Saffron Walden</b></a></p> <p><a name=\"h\"><b>Majority:</b> 10,573 over Liberal Democrats </a></p> <p><a name=\"h\"><b>Seat:</b> Saffron Walden since 1977 (formerly Middleton and Prestwich 1970-1974).

  "<p>Samuel Whitbread must be turning in his grave. The Bedford-born apprentice brewer who founded the Whitbread empire in 1742 based the business on \"porter\" - a strong, black beer popular among London's labourers. </p> <p>The only porters left in the company wear gold braid caps and wheel luggage around the firm's Marriott hotels. Moving further than ever from its boozy heritage yesterday, Whitbread announced it wanted to sell its 2,998 pubs. This move attracted a rare cheer from the City, which has regarded Whitbread as a rude word in recent years. Most pin-striped snobs associate the company with greasy Pizza Hut deliveries and spartan Travel Inn rooms. </p> <p>The management deserves credit for the strategic move - there has been a gradual realisation that the traditional \"local\" pub is an endangered species. Such outlets require time, attention and imagination of the kind which the big players such as Bass and Whitbread can rarely afford. </p> <p>Entrepreneurs such as Punch Taverns' boss Hugh Osmond, Enterprise Inns' Ted Tuppen and JD Wetherspoon's Tim Martin have shown they can run boozers more efficiently than megalithic leisure conglomerates. </p> <p>Unfortunately, the timing of Whitbread's exit is tricky, coming in the middle of a review of the regulatory Beer Orders, and with a glut of other pubs on the market depressing prices. </p> <p>However, the pubs need to go sooner, rather than later, to leave Whitbread in more palatable shape. All the company needs to do now is to revive the performance of its more tired-looking brands such as Caf\u00e9 Rouge and Beefeater. New chairman Sir John Banham should contribute a few few retailing tricks, having chaired Kingfisher for the last five years. Perhaps he can help persuade the City that Whitbread is in the 21st, rather than the 18th, century. </p> <p><strong>Over-egged</strong><br> </p> <p>The mighty Goldman Sachs should be severely embarrassed over the short stock market record of Telecity, the computer warehousing firm it floated in June and which yesterday saw its shares crash by 40% after lower-than-expected quarterly revenues. </p> <p>The American investment bank is both financial adviser and corporate broker to the company; its clients are full of the stock. Yet its analysts were expecting Telecity to deliver turnover figures 20% higher than the company could manage in the three months to end-September. </p> <p>This could be treated as little more than a \"disappointment\" - a new company in a volatile industry over-egging expectations and then getting it wrong. The new economy is a risky place to do business. </p> <p>But, in a stock market sense, Telecity has been a mess since the listing plans were first revealed. The float was pulled in the middle of May's dot.com sell-off and then suddenly thrown back on track a fortnight later. Some \u00a3116m was raised at a price which valued the company at \u00a3570m, but the offer was restricted to Goldman's institutional clients, with retail investors locked out, an action which used to be against stock exchange rules for an issue of this size. </p> <p>The net result was an exceptionally tight market in Telecity shares, where just a little bit of interest from the share buying public was enough to send the price rocketing to \u00a323 at one stage, against the 775p float price. Yesterday, the illiquidity worked the other way as the price careered down from \u00a311.35 to 687.5p. </p> <p>In the process, a dark cloud has been thrown over the planned flotation of three similar companies: InterXction, Global Switch and IXEurope. Goldman received a fee of just over \u00a35m bringing Telecity to market. Nice work if you can get it. </p> <p><strong>Reason to smile</strong><br> </p> <p>The London stock exchange did not try to bill yesterday's ballot on lifting a 4.9% stake limit on its shares as a proxy for the crucial vote on the hostile bid by Sweden's OM. But Don Cruickshank, chairman and acting chief executive, may have allowed himself a brief grin when his shareholders overwhelmingly voted down the resolution at yesterday's extraordinarily calm EGM. </p> <p>The decision not to lift the restriction, which technically prevents the OM bid succeeding, appears to reflect shareholders' lack of interest in selling to anyone. </p> <p>As has been said here before, however, this is no reason for Mr Cruickshank and his colleagues to be complacent. Thankfully, yesterday's second defence document shows signs of the long-awaited fight back and even contains some real strategy; a pan-European high-tech market, broader international vision, a full market flotation at some stage and the sale of the gruesome Old Broad Street tower once it can get leaseholders occupying half the building out. Such thinking has not arrived a day too soon.</p>",
  "More than half a million Countryside Alliance protesters are preparing to take to the streets of London \"in the biggest civil rights demonstration Europe has ever seen\" - spurred on by the deputy prime minister's recent derision of their \"contorted faces\" - the campaign's chairman said yesterday. <p>The pro-hunting pressure group has set a date for next March - likely to be only weeks before the general election - informed the relevant authorities, and put in place contingency plans for a protest that it believes could attract double the 300,000 who attended the previous countryside march on London's streets two years ago. </p> <p>The group's chairman, John Jackson, said the government would only avoid this by bowing to their demand for a department for rural affairs and by indicating both a cut in fuel prices and no ban on fox hunting. </p> <p>But he suggested campaigners had already been pushed too far by John Prescott's \"unfortunate remark\" at the Labour party conference in Brighton this month. \"Every time I see the contorted faces of the Countryside Alliance, I redouble my determination to vote to abolish fox hunting for ever,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Jackson added: \"We are already heading in the direction of the biggest civil rights demonstration Europe may ever have seen.\" </p> <p>Addressing 600 supporters at the alliance's second annual conference in Kensington, west London, he said: \"Unfortunately, and I was very sad to see it because I personally have much affection for him, the deputy prime minister has pushed us further down that road in front of the whole nation.\" </p> <p>Mr Jackson's threat of a fur ther display of the \"seething resentment and discontent\" of rural protesters came as he revealed the alliance would be providing every rural parish in England with internet access to galvanise support and coordinate protest. </p> <p>Within two years, all 17,000- odd parishes would have the hi-tech hardware, together with their own campaigning coordinator, while 3,000 parishes would be given the service within the next three months. </p> <p>The alliance also unveiled an 80-point rural manifesto to challenge the government's delayed rural white paper, which was originally due to be published next month. </p> <p>Responding to Mr Jackson's demands, the environment minister, Michael Meacher, attempted to smooth the anger generated by Mr Pres cott's comment, insisting that there was \"little between\" the government and the alliance on broad strategy. </p> <p>While unable to promise more money for farmers, he admitted there was \"an extremely serious crisis\" in the industry. </p> <p>He said a bill on fox hunting, on which MPs would have a free vote, would be introduced in the next session of parliament, but gave no commitment to the idea of a department for rural affairs, insisting instead it was a decision for the prime minister.</p>",
  "<p>Nicola Bruce's I Could Read the Sky is based on Timothy O'Grady's book of the same name. It's a work which, with photographs by Steve Pyke, superbly evoked the mental state - anguish, fond memory, despair, disgust and the sweaty terrors of digs and pub life - of the Irish exile living off the building sites and decaying towards a lonely death. Stranded in his digs in Camden Town, J Brady (with Michael Collins, one of the many pseudonyms the men on \"the buildings\" use to keep a distance from authority) mutters to himself of past and wretched present. </p> <p>The fragmented world he evokes, baleful or radiant, slips in and out of focus, offering as much torment as consolation. The filming itself is as wilful: continual superimposition and soft focus; allusive, impressionistic and occasionally surreal. When Brady (played by Dermot Healy) encounters an old friend from home (Stephen Rea), the camera becomes as drunken as the protagonists. </p> <p>Only gradually does a storyline emerge: a simple one of a lost homeland, slavish work, a crippling accident, love found in a pub and quenched one day when, walking towards him - \"Her hand stalls in the air as if she's forgotten something\" - she collapses and dies. Like everything else in Brady's life, it is too fragmentary an episode to linger over sentimentally for too long. </p> <p>The camera declares that the texture of exile - of mud, of brick, of old faces, of accordions (the only reliable source of joy) and of spoons and pigs (\"with eyes like a priest, calm and sure\") - is as important as the shifting reality of the people. But exile, particularly that spooky kind of exile whereby the Irish squat in a country which perversely refuses to acknowledge their foreignness because of the apparently common language, is not what it used to be. Global homogenisation has smoothed out the wrinkles of individuality and islands - which not so long ago were joined only by the unstabilised, vomit mailboat from Dun Laoire - are permanently logged on to each other. </p> <p>Instead of the battered leather suitcase, the Irish now bring their briefcases, mobile phones and PCs, magic boxes of instant communication with home. This, to an extent at least, reduces the sweetest anguish of exile: remembering in isolation. Brady reveals, in a list of some of the things he could do, how ill-equipped the emigrant was on arrival in London. \"I could thatch a roof. Knew the song to sing to a cow when milking. Cut turf. Work the swath turner, the float and thresher. Read the sky. Remember poems.\" </p> <p>The things he couldn't do explains why the Irish all huddled for comfort in Camden Town, Kilburn or Willesden. \"I couldn't: eat a meal lacking potatoes. Trust banks. Wear a watch. Ask a woman to go for a walk. Drive a motor car. Wear a collar in comfort. Acknowledge the Queen. Drink coffee. Follow cricket. Speak with men wearing collars... Stop remembering.\" </p> <p>That was the traditional Irish exile, forced from a barren farm to earn a living on building sites. There is an extra-ordinary lack of film record of this, one of the most persistent and highly-charged of population movements: the defensive and defenceless Irish, shabbily treated by their own country, morosely putting themselves at the mercy of the traditional enemy. </p> <p>A rare example is Philip Donnellan's 50-minute The Irishmen. Shot in 1965 by the excellent cameraman Michael Williams on the building sites and in London Irish pubs and homes, it was made just at the point where the Irish were shifting upwards socially. </p> <p>The Irishmen discloses the physical horror, to them, of urban England: the aggressive resentment at being treated like a lower and - more enraging - amusing species. It underlines their baggage of religious belief and intolerance, of primitive patriotism and even muddled pride in their manual achievements over here. But mostly it shows the Irishman as a wounded beast, part nomad, part squatter. One worker describes his first impression: \"It was just daybreak when I got to Manchester. Everything was black. Even though the day was coming out, it was as if it didn't want to, as though Manchester wasn't entitled to daylight.\" </p> <p>They had come from luminous, rural Ireland with its eternally cleansing winds. \"The darkness of the place,\" said another. \"And wide open spaces. Where were all the cows? Nothing in sight, all I could see was buildings and tracks. Where were they all leading to?\" The experience was riddled with perplexing incomprehension, temperamental clashes and rigid stereotyping. </p> <p>In the 50s and 60s, the Irish were building England, as one man on the building sites put it belligerently in the film: \"Go down to Camden Town in the morning, go to the Brecknock in the morning, go to the Nag's Head just at the Seven Sisters Road, go up to the Archway, and ask me who was doing the work in this country? They were all Irishmen. Who built the road at the Nag's Head? A man from Dingle. That was the man who put it through with Irish labour.\" It was the son of such a man who, when asked at school, \"Who made the world?\" answered: \"McAlpine.\" They were known as McAlpine's Fusiliers, working in horrible conditions, famed in story and mocked in song: \"As down the glen came McAlpine's men with their shovels slung behind them/ We sweated blood and we washed down mud with quarts and pints of beer/ I remember the day that the Bear O'Shea fell into a concrete stair/ What Horeseface said, when he saw him dead, well it wasn't what the rich call prayers/...If you pride your life, don't join, by Christ, with McAlpine's Fusiliers.\" </p> <p>In the 50s, the English confronted them with the first of a series of prejudices. \"Paddy ye ran home when the war started!\" the English would say. In Donnellan's film, a man angrily rebuts this: \"There's lots of things I want the English people to understand. I've got a brother with a leg and an arm missing that fought for this country. My father fought from 1914 to 1918, two uncles killed at Dunkirk and my brother is at home now with a 10-guineas-a-week British army pension.\" They worked their way through layers of prejudice. By the 70s, it was their perceived sympathy with the IRA bombing campaigns. They kept their heads down after the Aldershot bombing - when some stores refused to stock Kerrygold butter (though Guinness was never withdrawn). The Birmingham bombing brought a deep insecurity to the settled community. But it passed and the Canary Wharf devastation resulted in no serious backlash. </p> <p>In the late 60s, the Irish shifted from a taboo against mixing in English politics (as distinct from sabotaging it) to direct involvement through the local Labour party. They already had Callaghan and Healey, never convincing representatives of Irish mentality. Now they got their own MP - and he sat (against all republican principles) in the House of Commons. Michael O'Halloran was elected MP for north Islington, a man who stood firm on Irish Catholic values (or not, as the occasion demanded). The Irish were on the way up. The roads had been built, the spaghetti junctions laid, the pubs serviced. Now they went into business on a massive scale. For a long time, they remained faithful Labour supporters. </p> <p>The Irish staged in 1965 the most dramatic public example of native culture: a hurling match at Wembley, billed The Fastest Game in the World (and the most dangerous). Later, prime minister Edward Heath was said to have expressed a willingness to attend what became an annual event. But the Irish were not yet ready for the Tories. In his book, The Irish In Britain (1972), Kevin O'Connor reported that \"such an invitation was not forthcoming from the Irish\". Bloody Sunday in Derry in January 1972 delayed the unthinkable move of the Irish to the Tories. But it became inevitable, and first to cross the line were the middle-class business community. </p> <p>As the Irish moved up the social ladder, their reputation for uncouth living and criminal tendencies - spectacular in the 50s - shifted onto blacks. From 1950 to 1960, although they represented only 2-3% of London's population, the Irish accounted for 7-12% of violent crime in the metropolis. Soon their Irishness became, even for themselves, less of a factor. There is less vomit nowadays on the decks of the boat from Dun Laoire. In any event, Ryanair long ago goosed Aer Lingus into providing cheap flights. The exile feels less stranded here; and, with this mobility, the many-tentacled communications systems and the new tiger economy, the anguish of exile is less visible; it has become a more private, discreet thing. The Irishman in England is no longer the wounded beast at bay, believing in Brendan Behan's exhortation: \"Trust in drink.\" </p> <p> \u0095 I Could Read the Sky is released on October 27.

  "<p><strong> Cameron Crowe</strong><br></p> <p>Music is still my first love. In a lot of ways, making the movie is an exercise in getting to the point when you can be in a dark room with all the records and putting the music on the movies. I never grew up studying movies or wanting to go to film school. I loved movies, but to me it was all about music. </p> <p>Doing a film portrait of 1973 was something I talked about for a long time. Initially, I wanted to write about Lester Bangs, who was a real vivid character of the day. I got side-tracked with a bunch of projects after Jerry Maguire; then a friend of mine said, what are you screwing around with these other ideas for? You're either going to do your script about 1973 or you will have talked about it and never done it. It's the kind of the thing someone says to you at the perfect time and it's like a dagger. The truth was, I kept all the artefacts from those days, all my old articles and all the touring room lists and all the backstage passes - they've all been in boxes that have never been put away. I've been living among the boxes for 27 years, and it was time to write the script and capture that thing that was still gnawing away at me. </p> <p>It was down to my mom that I got into journalism so young. Like the character of Elaine in the movie, she was a teacher who believed in an accelerated childhood. She decided I was going to be the last kid she was going to have, and she was going to try her theory out on me. In essence, it was to go to summer school, and acquire as many course units as possible, so you would graduate early, and see the world and start your career. If you were going to take time off, her theory was to put all the summers together, and take your vacation when you graduate high school before you go to college. </p> <p> So I went to school every summer; I was the pale, egghead student. Then I discovered rock music, courtesy of my sister. Just like my mom's worst fears, rock 'n' roll came in through the window, underneath the door, all around her, and it changed both my sister and me. I was making phone calls, and getting assignments from editors who didn't know how old I was. Her plan of the accelerated educational programme gave me the confidence to do all that stuff. By the time I came to her and said, you never let me have a summer, but now I want to go on the road with the Allman Brothers, she sort of gritted her teeth and let me do it. </p> <p>My first exposure to music magazines came via a shop in San Diego where they sold Zap Comix and rock magazines. There was a guy who worked there would let me look, even though you were supposed to be 18 - it was like porno. I thought the guys that wrote for them were the greatest people - they might have trashed the music, but respected it and lived the rock 'n' roll lifestyle. There was an underground paper in San Diego, the San Diego Door, and my sister used to go out with a guy who worked for them. On the condition I wouldn't tell mom, they took me to a meeting. I wanted to do record reviews for them - and when I asked, of course they said no. Music was the tool of the corporations. Then they thought, we need the advertising from the record companies. Next thing, they told me about another guy who sent in record reviews to them - and it was Lester Bangs. </p> <p>In the movie, William is constantly trying to define what's real and what's not as the Stillwater tour continues. Lester Bangs is the only guy who says that it's all a dirty industry. Yet these people - the band, the groupies, William - are all kidding themselves that they're part of a family when they're really part of an industry. It's more of an industry as it goes on. But this film is filled with contradictions, more than any of my other ones. People are continually contradicting themselves. Even Lester is a contradiction. In the longer version of the movie - our first edit, which we'll put out when the movie goes to DVD - Lester's jealous because the kid got an assignment at Rolling Stone. </p> <p>In 1973 I went into the offices of Rolling Stone in San Francisco for the first time. Before this I had been a freelance journalist working on the end of a phone to music editor Ben Fong Torres. I'd done my first piece for them in January of that year, an interview with Poco, with Richie Furay. They paid me $350 for it. A few months later, Jann Wenner, Rolling Stone's editor, wrote me, saying: \"You may turn out the youngest Rolling Stone man ever...\" </p> <p>The Allman Brothers Band was my first major assignment for Rolling Stone. So much of it became the movie. I was 15. My mom still thinks I'm gonna go to law school. She still says: you left home when you were 15 and never came back; if I'd known who Led Zeppelin were then I'd have never let you do it. At the time I used to say: \"Listen to Stairway to Heaven! These are intelligent, committed, enthusiastic gentlemen!\" </p> <p>The thing is, when I first got out there on the road and was writing about the Allman Brothers and Led Zeppelin and the Who and Lynyrd Skynyrd - and Neil Young; it wasn't the version of rock we think of today. It wasn't the penthouse-suite, we're-so-removed-from-our-fans, let's-all-be-rich-and-happy... The whole fat rich rock star thing happened later. '73 was, for me, always the year where it felt like the last moment before rock became a little less personal, a little more global. What I saw was the time before the period that's been captured in the movies in a kitsch way. A lot of that stuff came later. To me, there was a great feeling of us against the world in most of these bands. Then, all of rock music sold about the same as one Shania Twain album now, so it was a little more personal; these guys seemed to be in it for the feeling they got on stage, and hopefully girls and acclaim after that. Being too young for the girls and guys I was going to school with, it was the wildest thing to be taken in by Pete Townshend, for example. Of course, it didn't occur to me at the time that a lot of the motivation would be to get a good article out of me. But to me it was a very committed thing - it was a 70s without mirror-balls and without a lot of the faux grooviness that has been portrayed in the media. By the end of the 70s, it was a much different thing, and you had bands like the Eagles and Fleetwood Mac selling tens of millions of records. </p> <p>The interesting thing about the bands were that a lot of them were British - they were the remnants of the British Invasion. At the time there were a few albums that had gotten deep acclaim, that were loved deeply and were thought of as really powerful serious pieces of music. Who's Next, Led Zeppelin 2, Derek and the Dominos' Layla - these were albums that defined that period. But hard rock felt more American. American kids just went nuts for hard rock. Even Townshend said at the time - like with Won't Get Fooled Again - these are American youth anthems that we had no idea had such power over the audience. Led Zeppelin never took an ad on any of the tours I was on. It was all word of mouth. And they never had singles. It was all a private thing. It's kind of like Metallica now. </p> <p>Then there was the Zeppelin tour I went on; that also contributed a lot to the movie. As many people probably know, Rolling Stone tore into all of their albums. So Jimmy Page said that he'd never talk to Rolling Stone, even though Rolling Stone always wanted to put them on the cover. The LA Times sent me on tour with them, and to convince them to do Rolling Stone, I stuck around on the tour with them. And as in the movie, a couple of days turned into a long three-week tour. My eyes got blood-red because I didn't get any sleep. One by one, they all said they'd do it; except for Page, who kept saying: \"In another city, I'll make the decision.\" Of course, that becomes the focus of the movie, too, as Russell Hammond continually plays the same game with William. </p> <p>By the end of the 70s I started to burn out on journalism. I was taking on too much and taking too long with stories. I didn't know how much further I could go. I wanted to interview Marvin Gaye, but he wasn't doing any more interviews, and I really wanted to do a Rolling Stones story for Rolling Stone. That was when I started on Fast Times at Ridgemont High. Having exhausted rock journalism and having kind of hit a wall, I wanted to write this book that would be about high school and the experience I didn't have, because of my mom skipping me all those grades. I took to it immediately, because I thought it was almost more rock than rock, to write about the high school experience. Ironically, I found this entire school year was about the fact that Led Zeppelin was going to come to town; and everyone was gearing up for Zeppelin. And then Bonham died, and the tour was cancelled, and it really did change lives. The original title of Fast Times was Stairway to Heaven. I was still writing about rock, but from a different perspective. </p> <p>Celebrity journalism is different now. The story the kid files at the end of the movie, he's been the mediator a little bit, and left some of the warts out, but left quite a few of them in, and made his moral judgment on the band, and wrote about what he saw. Now, though, pieces don't get as long, the access is way different, and way cut down, all this stuff happens in a hotel room on a junket for 30 minutes. It's a different environment. There are a number of times where the bands or musicians I was writing about back in the 70s - Neil Young for example - would say: write about what you see. Part of that is that they wanted to see their life mirrored back to them; it's therapy in a way. They want to get your perspective on what's going on - how do I appear to the outside world? Of course, you never appear the way you think you do, so whenever you hold up a mirror to somebody, they're going to see things that bother them. </p> <p>The main effect of my Rolling Stone career was that I felt like I had a place in the world. I could write about this thing that I loved so much; and as rough as it was, and caught in the middle as I was, I guess it was my persona back then. I ran into Stephen Stills at a football game a year and a half ago, and he introduced me to his wife. Here's how he introduced me. \"This is Cameron. He was a fan who always got caught in the middle between wanting to be friends with us, and wanting to please Rolling Stone, who didn't like us as much as he did.\" I thought: wow, what happened to the power and mystery of journalism and writing? That was the role I played: the fan who had several masters to serve - one of which was...me. </p> <p> <strong>Charles Shaar Murray</strong><br></p> <p> 1973 as a rock and roll Annus Mirabilis? Six thousand miles away from the old Rolling Stone office in San Francisco, it felt more like a fancy-dress party somewhere in Teenage Wasteland the morning after the revolution didn't happen. For 15-year-old Cameron Crowe, torturing his mom with Led Zeppelin and the Allman Brothers Band it may have seemed as if a depoliticised version of the rock'n'roll hippie dream was still in full effect, but John Lennon had already announced that \"the dream is over\", and within the shabby confines of New Musical Express's funky, down-at-heel offices in Long Acre, it was - in the words of Bryan Ferry - \"time to try for something new.\" </p> <p>I'd arrived at the NME the previous summer, just before turning 21, having been headhunted from OZ and IT - the Brit underground press - and bringing their agenda with me. This meant being FOR sex, drugs and freaking out the squares by any means necessary, and AGAINST racism, corporate rock and Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer. By this time, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin and Jim Morrison were dead, the Beatles had broken up, the Rolling Stones were wearing their cynicism on their (album) sleeves, Bob Dylan was off somewhere being gnomic and incomprehensible, Sly Stone was sinking into hard-drug decline, and radical idealism was sprawled bleeding outside Kent State university or locked up with the Black Panthers. In America, nevertheless, it was still possible to pretend that the 60s were still alive: in Britain it wasn't. </p> <p>My generation of British rock writers had drawn an enormous amount of inspiration from the likes of Rolling Stone, which had in its first few years blasted a path for an entirely new kind of rock writing, but then settled into woozy complacency. The most inspiring of the pioneers were Greil Marcus - who brought critical rigour, piercing insight and vaulting intellectual ambition to the milieu - and Lester Bangs, whose infectious passion and furious irreverence towards established proprieties and standardised verities struck a chord with every would-be iconoclast. </p> <p>It was Lester's next port of call, Detroit's Creem magazine, that provided us with our most enduring American model. Creem was edgy where Rolling Stone was mellow; satirical where Rolling Stone was sycophantic; fun where Rolling Stone was, let's face it, dull with a capital DUH. Creem's photo captions (many of them written by Lester, as we later discovered) were either surreal jokes or sardonic digs at their subject. Where the British pop weeklies of the era treated their readers like besotted teenyboppers and their rockier equivalents addressed their punters as if they were aspiring roadies, Creem talked to you as if you were smart, adventurous and passionately committed to the music as a source of both fun and redemption. As we were, or thought we were. </p> <p>NME's ethos was straightforward: power to the people. The people in question being our readers, who had first call on our loyalty. We despised the record industry, gave not even two hoots for the sensitivities of our publisher or the profits of their shareholders, and relentlessly satirised even favourite musicians like Bryan Ferry - whose ludicrous clothes and fragile ego inspired us to seek endlessly for new ways to misspell his name. (The most memorable included Brain Fury, Biriyani Ferret, Byron Ferrari, Brown Furry and Brawn Fairy.) Americans had no idea what to make of us. Taking the piss out of the stars verged on l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9, if not outright sacrilege. </p> <p>Of course, the intrinsic differences between the British and American rock scenes were massive. America was a very big, very wealthy country where supergroups lurched around a circuit of huge arenas playing to vast crowds stuffed full of drugs. Britain was a small country with very few enormodomes and considerably lower disposable incomes. Which meant that the biggest of the British bands - Led Zeppelin, the Who, the Rolling Stones - followed the dollar and effectively became American groups: as remote from UK audiences as the Allman Brothers (who never played Britain until after guitarist Duane Allman, their star attraction, had croaked) or the Grateful Dead. Nowadays, MTV can carry a new trend all over the US almost in real time, but in the early 70s the sheer size and scale of the place meant that change occurred with agonising slowness; whereas in tiny little Britain the speed of pop-cultural events was exhilaratingly accelerated. </p> <p>The Allmans may have been the bees' knees for Rolling Stone's readers, but as far as the NME was concerned, cosmic cowboys with cocaine crusted in their walrus moustaches were last decade's thing. For us, 1973 was about the science-fiction glam-rock of David Bowie and Roxy Music, and the hypnotic new groove filtering over from Jamaica. Our taste in Americans ran more to proto-punks like Iggy Pop and the late, lamented MC5 than to hayseed millionaire hippies like Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash, and our midnight turntables were more likely to be spinning Bob Marley's Burnin' or Iggy's Raw Power than any Mellow Mafia mumblings from LA. We spent the first half of the 70s willing punk into existence, though, for some of us, when it finally arrived it wasn't quite what we ordered. </p> <p>So: Golden Age of what, exactly? Well, if 1973 represented anything of that nature, it was the golden age of promotional expenditure and all the concomitant opportunities to bite the hand that fed us. In those days, record companies seemed to have unlimited amounts of money to blow on dumb stunts to promote dumber records, and we considered it our revolutionary duty to make sure that they spent as much of it as possible on entertaining us. Coaches would be chartered to schlep several dozen lurching, reeling hacks to see risibly useless bands at Bristol Colston Hall. Beer, wine and non-vintage champagne would flow as press officers, prettily accoutred in the latest company T-shirts, sauntered down the aisles dropping large chunks of hash and fresh packs of Rizla papers into passengers' waiting hands. No conceivable album was so inconsequential a cultural event that it didn't arrive bundled with T-shirts and badges, or wasn't marked by a launch party. Sometimes the bands would actually perform, which was irritating but often unavoidable. </p> <p>Indicate that you might, under certain circumstances, be prepared to write a 400-word concert review of some dodgy combo and the next thing you knew another press officer would be flying you to Amsterdam, buying you a stupefyingly expensive dinner, taking you on a tour of the red light district and uncomplainingly parting with corporate wedge to buy you a wrap of overpriced cocaine. Then you'd get home, slide behind the typewriter for 15 minutes and slag the band off. Oh how we laughed! </p> <p> The time-honoured institution of the press junket was the vehicle through which I met, albeit on different occasions, both Cameron Crowe and Lester Bangs. The teenage Crowe was the very soul of amiability: relaxed and confident beyond his years, as well he might be, considering that he was a top writer for a major publication and made considerably more money than any of us did. Bangs, despite his fearsome reputation, was a genial bear of a man and, on his visits to NME, was sufficiently sober to converse perceptively, charmingly and - bogglingly enough - quietly. </p> <p>As rock writers go, Bangs and Crowe could not have been more different. Crowe, despite his considerable talents, was essentially a fanboy: a \"friend of the stars\" who rarely upset the applecart by expressing a controversial opinion. He had the kind of presence which relaxed his subjects, made them feel protective towards him, encouraged them to open up. This is a considerable asset for an interviewer, make no mistake, and it paid off, big time. Lester, on the other hand, was essentially a critic, ranter and raconteur: a grimy prophet howling in the wilderness. His celebrated interviews with Lou Reed were knockabout classics of the genre - someone, incidentally, should adapt the transcripts of those interviews into a screenplay entitled Lester &amp; Lou before anybody here gets significantly older - but his scabrous attacks on the second-rate (especially the expensively-hyped second-rate) and passionate hymns to the transcendent power of loud, filthy noise forever barred him from the first-class lounge where publishers, performers, record companies and journalists smoothly network and conspire against the public interest. The world needs a lot more Lesters - it's a dirty job but somebody's got to do it - though comparatively few are prepared to pay the price. Lester paid it, in full, dying in 1982 at the age of 33. He died a stupid death after living a stupid life, but leaving behind him a body of work which virtually defines its genre. </p> <p>Cameron Crowe, on the other hand, will be remembered primarily for his movies. Though possibly not this one. </p> <p> \u0095 Almost Famous is the opening film of the LFF, screening at 7.30pm, November 1 at the Odeon Leicester Square and 3.15pm, November 2 at the Odeon West End. The movie will go on general release on January 26. The screenplay is published by Faber &amp; Faber at \u00a36.99.
