  "<p>It is either one of the biggest daily hazards of modern working life or a myth concocted by the idle to justify their laziness: it all depends on your perspective. For those who believe in it, sick building syndrome has long been thought to stem from poorly maintained air conditioning systems, toxic photocopiers and dusty offices. Now, in a curious echo of another of our greatest workplace fears, it seems the explanation could lie in a particularly nasty form of computer virus. </p> <p>According to a team of Swedish scientists, flame-retardant chemicals used in plastic computer casings could be to blame. The researchers conducted experiments which showed how, as computers heated up during the course of the working day, they began to emit into the air an allergenic chemical, triphenyl phosphate. Eighteen leading brands of computer were tested and now the experts are urging manufacturers to \"bake off\" new computers for 10 days to release the worst of the chemicals before they arrive in office buildings. </p> <p>The discovery may finally provide the evidence needed to convince those who still need convincing that sick building syndrome has a scientific basis, instead of being a malingerer's charter. The Health and Safety Executive, which monitors office environments, estimates that between a third and a half of all new or re-conditioned buildings are afflicted; the employees at highest risk, according to a recent study by the University of Strathclyde, are clerical workers who wear contact lenses and work at computers in air-conditioned buildings. Airborne bacteria in such offices, which often have low levels of humidity, become electrically charged and settle on computer screens or on contact lenses, or are breathed in. </p> <p>The travels of bacteria around offices and into workers' nostrils may not be an appetising field of study, but professor Derek Clements-Croome of Reading University has made it his own. The author of Creating the Productive Workplace, Clements-Croome advises companies on how to avoid sick building syndrome. He talks zealously about \"the emotional content of space\" and is evangelical about improving the quality of air in the workplace. </p> <p>\"It takes just four seconds for a single breath to travel from your nostrils to your blood supply,\" he says. \"But if the air is stuffy or polluted, you can't oxygenate that breath, so you become tired and sluggish.\" </p> <p>His research notwithstanding, the most alarming thing about the bacteria with which we share our workspaces is how little we know them. \"The biggest problem with these types of airborne chemicals is that we don't yet know the effects of long-term exposure to them,\" says Professor Vyvyan Howard, a toxicologist at Liverpool University. \"They are pernicious because you breathe them in but then the body doesn't get rid of them. They are fat-soluble and persistent - our bodies retain the toxic chemicals. If you're a woman and become pregnant, experiments have shown you pass a dose to your child. In the past 20 years, there's been a 60-fold increase in these compounds in breast milk - and in the last five years the figure has doubled.\" </p> <p>Likely effects of exposure can include skin rashes, allergic reactions akin to hay fever, tiredness and flu-like symptoms. So far the only known way to alleviate the effects is really vigorous ventilation - not exactly a speciality of most British offices. </p> <p>When companies ask Clements-Croome about the ideal office space, he sends them to Japan, to the Kajima building in Tokyo. There they have an atrium filled with birdsong and a scented garden. \"There's music, but it's not constant - human beings like contrast and change. From time to time, people walk by and offer trays of refreshments. You don't order from a cafeteria, they just bring you things so you feel cared for. </p> <p>\"The mistake architects make when designing office spaces is that they appeal only to the aesthetic. Office environments need to stimulate all five senses in a harmonious way. That means providing a good amount of natural light, nice smells and no jarring background noise. Touch is often forgotten - we need to be surrounded by natural surfaces such as glass, wood and stone.\" </p> <p>That's all very well for moneyed multinationals moving into new premises, but even companies stuck with decrepit buildings can go a long way to creating a healthy environment. \"All companies should provide alternative spaces where workers can take breaks,\" Clements-Croome says. \"A coffee break is of no use. Generally, we work in two-hour cycles, then we feel a dip because our brain is asking us to do something else. Rather than be inactive, we need to be stimulated in a different way - by listening to music, meditating, taking exercise or having a massage.\" </p> <p>Even the most expensive office technology may contribute to the problem, rather than alleviate it. \"As human beings, we have a deep desire to control our environment,\" Clements-Croome says. \"If the windows are locked because of the air conditioning, that will create resentment and depression among workers.\" </p> <p>A glimpse of what the future may hold is to be had at Home, a new London-based firm of estate agents. Oak floorboards have replaced depressing carpet tiles; there are TV screens built into corrugated iron, leather armchairs, poodle-hair upholstery and a help-yourself jelly- bean dispenser. The purpose, of course, is to sell houses, but there is more to it than that, according to Rosalyn Dexter, Home's \"design and ergonomics consultant\". (She avoids the term \"feng shui\" because firms are increasingly suspicious of it, she says.) </p> <p>\"Our workspaces are constantly subliminally sending messages to us and that has an impact on our health and wellbeing,\" Dexter says. \"You don't want offices to be Zen-like and calm, they need to stimulate creativity and productivity, and design can do that. Artwork, symbolism and colour can help - empty walls are very negative.\" </p> <p>The positioning of desks can create subtle hierarchies, she argues - power divisions in open-plan offices that can cause stress among workers if not managed properly. The confrontational opposition of desks so common in contemporary offices is a particularly bad idea. \"We all bring emotional stuff to our desks,\" she says. \"We don't need to be dealing with other people's emotions over them.\" </p> <p>Yet the best advice may ultimately be the most old-fashioned: plenty of plants (especially spider plants, which help oxidise the air) and plenty of happy photographs. Not that these need to be the traditional gallery of spouse, family or friends. \"A great trick is to put pictures up all around your desk of the things you want to buy or achieve through your job,\" Dexter says. \"One chap I worked with in a City firm had large photos of his dream place in the sun. It worked wonders for his sales technique.\"</p>",
  "<p>Bill Alexander, the Thames Water chief executive, stands to make more than \u00a31m from the deal with RWE while his non-executive chairman, Roger Carr, has lined himself up for his second windfall in seven days - he expects to gain \u00a32m from a different deal announced last week. </p> <p>The two Thames men will be turning on the money taps because the takeover will realise some personal share holdings, share options and employment contracts. </p> <p>Mr Alexander, who is to stay with the combined company and spearhead its global operations, holds 13,545 shares directly and has another 108,428 in options through long-term incentive schemes. </p> <p>If these could be exercised at the \u00a312.15 rate offered by RWE, the notional value would be \u00a31.5m, but a more realistic level seems to be around \u00a31.2m. </p> <p>Mr Carr, who only joined the board in April 1999, will be leaving when the deal is complete and will obtain one year's salary of \u00a3100,000. </p> <p>He will also take \u00a333,412 from the 2,750 shares he holds in Thames. Mr Carr last week announced plans to break up the former conglomerate, Williams, he built up with Sir Nigel Rudd and pocket \u00a32m plus a \u00a3180,000 continuing annual fee for acting as non-executive chairman of one of the two remaining former Williams' companies, Chubb. </p> <p>Analysts said the Thames men deserved to be well rewarded because they had lined up a deal which offered real value to all shareholders and gave the opportunity for the business to grow without any need for cost cutting. </p>",
  "<p>Benjamin Wegg-Prosser, a former adviser to Peter Mandelson, is joining Guardian Unlimited as publisher of two new internet ventures. </p> <p>The sites, which will launch early next year, will cover politics and the environment as part of the Guardian's continued online expansion into core areas. Each site is to have its own editor and editorial teams, which are expected to be appointed in the coming weeks. </p> <p>The announcement effectively means that Mr Wegg-Prosser, 26, has ditched plans to bring Slate, the US site owned by Microsoft, to the UK, a project he has been working on for the past nine months. </p> <p>\"After nine months of finalising the licensing with Microsoft, putting a team together and talking to investors, current market conditions mean that we're not able to raise enough funds to bring it to market,\" said Mr Wegg-Prosser. Slate UK was expected to make its UK debut in the new year, with Microsoft making a small equity investment.</p> <p>As publisher of the planned Guardian websites, Mr Wegg-Prosser will oversee commercial development and report directly to Simon Waldman, head of GU. \"It's a great opportunity to work on an excellent new media project. I can't wait to start,\" he said.</p> <p>Before becoming involved in Slate UK, Mr Wegg-Prosser spent a year as communications manager at Pearson and prior to that spent four years as the Department of Trade &amp; Industry as a special adviser to Mr Mandelson.</p>",
  "<p>Anti-capitalism protesters today marched on the IMF and World Bank summit in Prague, throwing firebombs at police, who responded with tear gas and water cannons.</p> <p>Activists conducted a stand-off on a bridge on the route to the communist-era Congress Center in which the summit was today inaugurated, chanting \"Stop the economic terror now\" in protest against the two global lending institutions they call a menace to humanity. Official police figures placed their number at around 5,000; journalist sources say it might be double that, or more.</p> <p>Several policemen were set alight by Molotov cocktails and colleagues hosed them down with a water cannon. Dozens of people are reported to have been hurt.</p> <p>Earlier this morning, two people suffered head injuries during street fights and demonstrators threw rocks at a McDonald's outlet, cracking the glass door.</p> <p>The protesters have vowed to halt the meetings, arguing that the Washington-based institutions ignore the needs of the poor, decimating quality of life for millions. Some activists paraded outside the meeting, waving banners saying, \"Making love not trade\".</p> <p>Student Hans Jurgen from Bergen, Norway, turned out wearing a green hat festooned with dollar signs - a walking, talking caricature of globalisation's fat cats. \"I have children for lunch and I kill people in many countries of the world,\" Jurgen said.</p> <p>South African finance minister and conference chair Trevor Manuel said it was a pity the protests had \"descended into violence\" and queried activists' motives. \"I know what they're against but have no sense of what they're for,\" he said.</p> <p>World Bank president James Wolfensohn asked conference attendees to recognise the \"legitimacy\" of the protesters' concerns. \"Outside these walls young people are demonstrating against globalisation. I believe deeply that many of them are asking legitimate questions, and I embrace the commitment of a new generation to fight poverty. I share their passion and their question, but I believe we can move forward only if we deal with each other constructively and with mutual respect,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Wolfensohn furthered conceded the IMF and World Bank had a \"lot to learn\" about improving their efforts to combat poverty.</p> <p>The annual meeting proceeded as planned inside the building, with speeches from Czech president Vaclav Havel and Mr Manuel. </p> <p>The new managing director of the IMF, Horst Koehler, talked of the problems of globalisation: \"I am aware of the critical debate about globalisation, and many questions raised have to be of concern to all of us. But I also want to be clear: if the IMF did not exist already, this would be the time to invent it. More than ever, globalisation requires cooperation, and it requires institutions which organise that co-operation.\"</p> <p>Both Koehler and Mr Wolfensohn called for greater action to lift the living standards of the world's poor, focusing on better education and health care. Mr Koehler called on rich countries to lower their trade barriers on exports of farm goods and other products from poor countries, saying this could mean $100bn (\u00a366bn) annually in extra sales by poor nations. </p> <p>Mr Wolfensohn said that the processes tying the world more closely together economically cannot be stopped. \"We cannot turn globalization back. Our challenge is to make globalization an instrument of opportunity and inclusion - not of fear and insecurity,\" he said.</p> <p>The 15,000 delegates were transported at 5am this morning by bus to the conference centre. Czech police had conducted stringent border controls in recent days to ensure the conference took place without impediment, stopping almost 300 people with arrest records from previous anti-capitalism rallies. The authorities also deployed 11,000 police to strengthen security in Prague. </p> <p>Alice Dvorska, spokeswoman for one of the main activist umbrella groups at Prague, the Initiative Against Economic Globalization, condemned police interference: \"We condemn this attempt of the Czech government to prevent people from exercising their democratic rights to freedom of speech, movement and gathering\". </p>",
  "<p>Mothers are now programmed to believe that everything they do affects the welfare of their children - for better and for worse. Plenty of chat and the right stimuli as babies will make them more intelligent in later life; cruel words or neglect may land them in therapy or turn them into criminal delinquents. Smoking and alcohol are well known health risk factors for babies. A deficiency in folic acid in the first few weeks of a foetus's life can cause neural damage and even spina bifida... and so on. </p> <p>Now, a spate of research into the effects of diet on a woman at about the time of conception is ladling on yet more guilt before she even gets to shag the dad. It seems that a woman's health and diet in the hours before and after conception - before she may even realise she's pregnant - appears to have a profound affect on her baby's long-term health. </p> <p>Research findings from the University of Southampton, released last week, suggest that female rats briefly starved of protein shortly after conception have offspring with a higher rate of defects. Their female offspring are underweight at birth, while the males have high blood pressure, shrunken livers and enlarged kidneys. Research at Queen's University in Belfast, also released last week, suggests that the official advice of four units of alcohol per week for pregnant women may be under-cautious, for the mildest tipple may affect the foetus's nervous system. Research at St Thomas's Hospital in London, released earlier this month, seemed to show that eating too much fat and too little protein can create cardiovascular disease, regardless of how healthily the child lives after birth. Yet more research, from the University of North Carolina, has shown that gum disease can be as harmful to an unborn child as smoking regularly, for women with severe gum disease are seven times more likely to have a premature baby with low birth weight than those without. </p> <p>Then there is the rather thorny issue of toxins - harmful chemicals in the environment, pesticides, additives and hormones in our food - that build up in a woman's fat tissues over the years and get passed onto the foetus through the placenta and to the baby in breast milk. According to the World Health Organisation, people should ingest a maximum of 10 nanograms of polychlorinated chemicals and dioxins a day. Yet babies in western Europe, at two months old, are taking in on average 170 nanograms a day from their mothers' milk. (Natural birth advocate Michel Odent has devised a detoxifying regime for prospective parents to maximise the health chances of their as yet unconceived child.) </p> <p>Clearly there is bound to be a link between the diet of a mother and the health and welfare of her unborn child when she is manufacturing another human being. She \"eats for two\", with the growing foetus hijacking valuable nutrients such as calcium away from the mother to ensure its own healthy development. But how are women to differentiate between what may be significant and irrelevant when they understandably do not want to do anything that may harm their unborn child? </p> <p>Firstly, the experiments on protein deficiency were carried out on rats and there is no guarantee that we behave in the same way. Secondly, most of this research has been conducted on small samples and is by no means conclusive. Thirdly, and perhaps more importantly, everything we do or consume and perhaps even feel is bound to have some sort of an effect on growing children but if we stop to analyse all this and attempt to control it we drive ourselves mad with self reproach and risk, reverting to the dark old ages of superstition. My grandmother always maintained that my mother was born with a missing ear lobe because a bullet had grazed her own ear when she was pregnant. However, that perverted gene has jumped a generation and affected one of my nieces proving, perhaps, that the cause lay elsewhere. </p> <p>Living beneath an electricity pylon or near a nuclear power plant may increase the chances of cancer. Walking through busy streets in all likelihood increases respiratory diseases and asthma. Driving a car through rush hour traffic or working in a stressful job must raise a pregnant woman's blood pressure and any form of emotional distress will provoke adrenalin in both mother and baby. But this is modern life - we cannot avoid potential dangers and live enveloped in cotton wool. It won't be long before scientists find a tenuous link between excessive consumption of chocolate biscuits and hair loss or jogging and the shape of a babies nose. Diet in pregnant women is more balanced today than it has ever been. Babies are born fatter and healthier than ever, and more survive until adulthood than ever before in history. We know more about their nutritional needs, but we still indulge them with packets of fat-laden crisps, yoghurt pots heaving with unnecessary sugar and junk food riddled with additives. How can science disentangle genetic factors and the unhealthier ways we live our lives from the effects of a pregnant woman's behaviour on her unborn child? There is no way of knowing how many health problems are genetically programmed and beyond our control or the direct result of diet in pregnancy. This thirst for research into the impact of maternal behaviour on the foetus may equip some women with greater knowledge about how best to safeguard her baby's interests but the net effect is yet more guilt, as well as an uneasy sense that one can control the whole process of reproduction. Yet so much of it is still mysterious and down to chance. </p> <p>Clearly, any woman longing for a child wants to maximise the health and safety of her unborn child. But the danger is that there is so much that is beyond her control that all she may be left with is an encroaching sense of inadequacy, and what sort of start does that give to mother and child? Mother's matter, a great deal. If this research genuinely empowered them to be better mothers without cranking up all those feelings of guilt and inadequacy then it would be genuinely useful. But we're human too - and fallible. We all need that odd drink to lift the spirits, a bag of chips or a bar of chocolate for occasional comfort, and often pregnant women smoke because life is tense and stressful rather than the calm oasis that medical researchers and natural birth activists maintain it should be. Women do not exist just for the sake of reproduction. They live with the stresses and conundrum of modern life and inevitably they pass some of that on to their children.</p>",
  "<p>Winter: World Trade Organization riots in Seattle. Spring: World Bank/International Monetary Fund standoffs in Washington, DC. Then the May Day clashes in London and Berlin. I watch the escalating rhetoric, arrests and police crackdowns from South Africa with a touch of irony. The BBC shows large groups of comfortable, educated protesters violently confronting and challenging the legitimacy of smaller groups of equally well-nourished trade leaders, industrialists, agency heads and finance chiefs, all over the aid or agony global capitalism brings to nations like mine.</p> <p>As one who spent three decades exiled by and agitating against a country that did not recognize my vote, I fully support dissent and the freedom to express it. As one who has spent half a decade helping lead that country, I share the frustration when dissent and expression regress from a means into merely an end, smothering the message in the process. But from both perspectives, I wonder: Why not cut out the middle men and take the debate over globalization directly to third world cities like Sri Lanka, Brazil, Egypt, or Vietnam? Why not, to make it interesting, lock both sides indoors, face to face?</p> <p>I ask these questions not to be churlish, but for three reasons: </p> <p>First, these relatively poor places are precisely where the debate on \"global development\" - defined either in terms of McDonald's and Monsanto or agricultural subsidies and debt forgiveness - matters most. Second, their impoverished people - one billion lacking reliable tap water, two billion without electricity - are those for whom both sides claim to speak with authority. Lastly, over the past 18 months, one multinational authority tackled exactly these issues, in exactly these places, on the ground, and with surprisingly productive, nonviolent results. When chaotic protest becomes the norm in Europe and America, such pockets of calm are breaking news. </p> <p>That 'multinational authority' is the narrow-mandated, tight-staffed and short-lived World Commission on Dams. Born in controversy, it was established in 1998 - by globalization's protagonists and antagonists alike - to assess a critical aspect of international development and investment: which, how, where and why earth's 45,000 large dams have either worked or failed to deliver as expected. To do so, it analyzed seven dammed river basins under a microscope; studied the experience with dams in Russia, China and India; and evaluated trends through a cross- check survey of 150 dams worldwide. </p> <p>Based on the distilled evidence from this global review, the WCD will make authoritative recommendations and set rigorous criteria and guidelines for the construction, operation, overhaul and even decommission of new and existing dams.</p> <p>Which all sounds harmless enough. But the process can feel like putting out fire with gasoline. No natural resource, even gold, is more precious to any given country than its water. And no public tool has been more widely and controversially used for parting - and imparting - those water, than dams. Decisions over dams are decisions over sanitation. Crops. Drinking water. Health. Electricity. Flood control. A nation's future. </p> <p>Dam building is a $42 billion a year industry. In recent decades it has forced 4 million people from their homes each year; or roughly 11,000 per day, 450 every hour, 8 per minute. Not surprisingly, conflicts between governments building dams and people affected by dams have resulted in violence, occupation and alienation; conversely, there have been attacks on governments when dam projects were cancelled. In time of scarcity, dams are even believed by some leaders to have the capacity for triggering wars between nations sharing the same river. Now, in the interest of full disclosure, I chair the Commission. But I agreed to do so only after ensuring that, unlike so many self-perpetuating bureaucracies, our office would shut itself down, lock up and disband after fulfilling its two-year mandate this November.</p> <p>I back our mandate, but there are tense moments when I take comfort in our limited life span. Like when things grow suddenly testy between one commissioner who has spent his life engineering large dams around the world and another who has devoted her life to stopping one. Or when, starting on December 10, 1998, two hundred pro- and anti-dam forces from Pakistan, India, Bangladesh and Nepal converged upon our first meeting in Colombo, with a real potential to explode. Instead, we sat the protagonists opposite each other and asked them to explain to the Commission, in words of one syllable, their opposing perceptions. First, that dams, if done right, are critical tools for governments to use. Second, that over-centralised planning can devastate nature, cut off water that had been the lifeblood of villages for generations, and flood religious, cultural sites and homes with minimal concern for those affected.</p> <p>To be sure, there were heated moments. Government officials spoke passionately of growing populations, increasing demands for food, power and drinking water, national development goals and their responsibility to the people. </p> <p>Affected peoples talked equally passionately of their villages being destroyed, of resettlement in inadequate sites and the impersonal nature of the State when faced with real people living real lives with little food security and real livelihood risks.</p> <p>For three full days they talked. We listened. We absorbed a clash of perspectives. And we built on common ground, noting and respecting divergences. We made progress if only due to the fact that people felt they finally had the chance to put their case in a neutral arena, and that the Commission had listened to all sides. No crackdowns. No arrests. </p> <p>But perhaps that was just beginner's luck. </p> <p>In Sao Paolo, Brazil, on August 11, 1999 we had no sooner banged the gavel than word came that our meeting would quickly be overrun by nearly a thousand people who had been displaced by dams in Brazil. They had not been invited, but were moments away. Should we contact the police? Disband? Instead, we welcomed most of them inside, while the rest queued peacefully, sat listening to the debate and departed as quietly as they had come, their points made, listened to, and documented. </p> <p>In Cairo, December 8, 1999 we had to grapple with the delicate Middle Eastern politics of trans-boundary waters between Turkey and Syria, Jordan and Israel, and even protests from people directly affected by dams financed in large part by South Africa where I was Minister for water affairs. Again, we left unscathed, having brought both sides closer together.</p> <p>By Hanoi, February 26, 2000 we wrestled with the delicate Asian dynamic of complex relations between governments and civil society movements, some of whom are persona non grata at home and abroad. Yet once again we found acceptable ways for them to make their views heard and ensure that all sides of the debate are on the table. </p> <p>No one party was excluded. Ever. For exclusion breeds resistance. We can and do recognise divergence, but above all we must provide a neutral, free and ordered space, where violence is replaced by verbal debate, shouting by listening, chaos by calm.</p> <p>There is nothing novel to this approach; it is just rarely tried on the scale of a global theater. Also, few other institutions are small, finite or focused enough to attempt this. But it goes beyond a method soothing tensions to a standstill; it seeks to harness the dynamic forces out there, enfranchise them toward a mutually acceptable solution that lets all parties move forward, and turn them into forces for change, rather than merely blind resistance.</p> <p>Critics, from both sides, have cited the World Commission on Dams as a model for resolving disputes over globalization. That's flattering, but much too early to say. We have merely managed to take the debate off the streets, and clear one small patch of political ground over which the terms and conditions of a key dimension of global capitalism - imparting the wealth of water - can be negotiated. </p> <p>A parting warning: doing so is never a neat, organized, tidy concerto. More often, the process becomes a messy, loose-knit, exasperating, sprawling cacophony. Like pluralist democracy, it is the absolute worst form of consensus buildingexcept for all the others.</p> <p>Kader Asmal, South Africa's minister of water affairs and forestry under Nelson Mandela, and now education minister, chairs the World Commission on Dams. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.dams.org\">World Commission on Dams</a></p>",

  "Margaret, friends, <p>You have just heard from the man who has led Croatia away from the narrow politics of ethnic nationalism and put it on the path to modern European democracy. </p> <p>And now the people of Serbia also have voted to join modern Europe. </p> <p>With results in this morning from two thirds of the polling stations, the opposition are way ahead by 20 percentage points. In his home town, his own stronghold, Milosevic lost in every polling station. Even the army and the police, the backbone of his power, voted against him. </p> <p>Last night we saw tens of thousands of Serbs dancing on the streets of Belgrade with delight that he was overthrown. </p> <p>The only person who does not seem to know he lost is Milosevic himself. We know he was always planning to rig the central count. He had even written a new programme for the election computer and he didn't get it from elpac. </p> <p>But even Milosevic cannot conceal a defeat on this scale. </p> <p>Let's give Milosevic a clear message while he is trying to decide who won. Don't rob your people of their vote for change! Accept their verdict and go! </p> <p>We are on the verge of a new era for the Balkans. One that puts the politics of hate into history. </p> <p>It would not be happening if this government had not stood up to Milosevic when he attempted the brutal ethnic cleansing of Kosovo. We demonstrated that his fascism of ethnic cleansing belongs to Europe's past. We made it clear that we would not tolerate it returning to Europe's future. </p> <p>My regret is that the last Tory government wasted years in Bosnia refusing to stand up to ethnic cleansing. If they had shown the same resolve then Milosevic might have gone long before now. </p> <p>And now that the Tories are in opposition, they still refuse to stand up for human rights. </p> <p>Every now and again one of the press exposes that I travel more than any other cabinet member. One of them was gracious enough to say that at least as foreign secretary I had an excuse to travel. </p> <p>What I remember most from my official visits this year is not the capital cities. </p> <p>It is a camp I saw in Sierra Leone for 2,000 amputees. Every one of them a victim of rebel atrocities. Many of them children. </p> <p>Most of them had a hand lopped off. Some of them had lost both hands. Wherever I looked, I saw people holding out stumps, pleading for protection. </p> <p>The Tory defence spokesman has said we should withdraw from our commitment to Sierra Leone. I challenge him to go to that camp and tell those victims of the rebels that the Tories are in favour of abandoning them. </p> <p>We are in Sierra Leone out of simple human decency. We are there because it is in our interests that democratic government should not be overthrown by terrorism. </p> <p>We are there because we believe that everyone, whatever their colour, whatever their continent, has the same equal right to freedom that we have. </p> <p>When you look back over the past parliament, you can be proud of what your government has done around the world.</p> <p>Proud that across Africa and Asia there are villages with safe water, children with primary schools and mothers with health care, because Labour reversed the Tory aid cuts. </p> <p>Proud that it was the British ambassador who led the protest at the suppression of Aung San Suu Kyi. </p> <p>The Burmese military sent 200 riot police to detain one woman. That's how dangerous they find her ideas of freedom and democracy. </p> <p>Those are our values too. That's why we demand they set free Aung San Suu Kyi. </p> <p>Proud that it was your government that banned the export, import and production of landmines. </p> <p>I remember queuing up to hear Lord Justice Scott prising the truth out of the Tory government about their arms sales to Iraq. It gave me a lot of pleasure to hear him say that he had read Labour's annual report on arms exports, and he was \"amazed by the difference\". </p> <p>We have produced the fullest, most comprehensive annual report on arms exports of any country in Europe. </p> <p>We agreed a code of conduct on arms sales with the rest of the EU. </p> <p>One under which we all apply the same strong standards on human rights. </p> <p>One which for the first time gives us the right to object if any partner takes up an arms contract we refused. </p> <p>We have made sure that those who are denied the truth by their own government can hear it through us. </p> <p>On Thursday, Conference will hear Nelson Mandela, who was encarcerated for almost 30 years by the apartheid regime. Throughout those long years, his only window to the outside world was a radio which could receive the BBC World Service. </p> <p>Nelson Mandela would approve that your government has reversed the Tory vandalism of the World Service. </p> <p>Because of Labour's investment, it now reaches 150m people worldwide. </p> <p>That public diplomacy between peoples is just as important as the official diplomacy between governments. </p> <p>So that we can do both better, we have made the Foreign Office more representative of all the diversity of modern Britain. </p> <p>A 50% increase in staff from ethnic communities. A 100% increase in the number of women Ambassadors and heads of post. </p> <p>The Foreign Office should represent all the people of Britain. And should serve all the people of Britain. </p> <p>Every year tens of thousands of British Muslims go on the Haj pilgrimage to Mecca. This year Britain was the first western country to provide consular help on the Haj for British citizens. </p> <p>We have put human rights at the heart of our foreign policy. </p> <p>Last week's report on our record by Amnesty concluded: \"The balance sheet shows a record of real achievement\". </p> <p>But we have to be realistic. If we want to make a difference in the world, we cannot do it alone. We do it by setting the agenda in the unique range of international organisations to which Britain belongs. And that is what we have been doing. </p> <p>In the G8, where Britain has been in the lead in securing relief for the poorest countries burdened by debt. We are freeing those countries from the debts of their past so that they can afford to educate the children that are their future. </p> <p>At the UN, where Britain is leading the campaign to expose the illicit trade in diamonds from regions in conflict. The price of diamonds should not come with a cost in human life. </p> <p>In the Commonwealth, where under Labour Britain is now at one with our partners. In contrast to the Tories who made themselves a minority of one in opposing sanctions against apartheid. </p> <p>Partnership abroad is essential if we are to succeed at home. </p> <p>If we want to live in peace then we need to strengthen our alliances. </p> <p>If we want factories with full order books, then we need to widen our trade agreements. </p> <p>If we want to protect our national environment then, we need to negotiate global commitments to halt climate change. </p> <p>That is the way to promote Britain's interests. To work in partnership, to set the agenda. To find common cause with other countries. </p> <p>It comes easy to Labour to do that. Our movement is built on the principles of partnership, of solidarity, of cooperation. </p> <p>But that's not the Tory way. I have read their new international policy. It doesn't take long. One of the reasons it doesn't take long is that it does not mention a single one of those international organisations. Nothing on the G8. Nothing on the UN. Nothing on the Commonwealth. </p> <p>It is the first time in history that a party has tried to produce a foreign policy while trying to avoid working with foreigners. Especially if they're Europeans. </p> <p>Tory policy on Europe reveals no trace of being influenced by its impact on our 14 partners. But it might have been made up by someone under the influence of 14 pints. Or who had spent too much time reading the Europhobic press. </p> <p>Most of their stories about Europe seem come from an alternative planet. One known only to the Europhobic press. From that uncharted planet, all sorts of horrors emerge. They have threatened us: - that lollipop ladies will be harmonised; that darts will be banned from British pubs; and that rubber ducks will be banished from British bathtubs. Not one of them is true. </p> <p>Every day the Daily Mail has a fresh challenge for us. Today I give the Daily Mail a challenge. </p> <p>Tell your readers the truth about Europe. Tell them 3m British families depend for their living on exporting to Europe. Tell them five thousand American and Japanese companies have invested in Britain because we are in Europe. </p> <p>Tell them 2.5m people have the right to a paid holiday for the first time in their working lives thanks to the Working Time Directive. A measure opposed by the Tories. Brought in by Labour. </p> <p>Look. I'll let you into a secret. I never did much like the Tory party. But I'll say this for old Toryism. The Tory party of Heath, of Heseltine, of Ken Clarke was capable of recognising our national interest. </p> <p>The Tory party of Hague, of Redwood, of Portillo is too blinkered by party prejudice to see the national interest. </p> <p>One Tory frontbencher has said we should renegotiate our terms of membership or \"pull out if we cannot\". </p> <p>I have great respect for our partners in Europe. But confronted with Hague; Redwood; Portillo; Widdecombe - it is just possible our partners might be tempted to suggest they skip the renegotiation and go straight to pulling out. </p> <p>What saddens me most about Tory policy on Europe is that it is so defeatist. It assumes that Britain is so weak, so lacking in confidence that it will always lose out in Europe.</p> <p>Maybe it would under William Hague. But we have not let Britain lose out in Europe. </p> <p>Labour set the pace on economic reform in Lisbon earlier this year. We set Europe the goal of a knowledge economy as competitive, as innovative, as skilled as anywhere on the globe. And, for the first time in the history of the European Union we committed it to the goal of full employment. </p> <p>While the Tories are trying to work out how to leave Europe, all over central and eastern Europe people are queing up to join. </p> <p>Labour has made Britain the champion of enlargement. We reject the model of a fortress Europe which shuts out those new democracies from sharing our prosperity. </p> <p>What have the Tories done? They have promised a referendum on the treaty to prepare Europe for enlargement. And they have threatened to campaign against it. They could achieve the remarkable double of becoming as unpopular with the dozen candidate countries as they already are with the existing 14 member states. How dare they pose as advocates of referendums? In all their long years in power they never let the people have a referendum on anything. Now they are opposed to a referendum on the single currency. </p> <p>Labour will let the people decide. If we conclude that our five tests have been met, we will recommend in a referendum entry into the single currency. </p> <p>We will not let Britain lose out by staying out </p> <p>We know Britain must be in Europe. But we also know Europe needs reform. We want a more efficient commission. </p> <p>We want a more democratic Europe. We want a new role for national parliaments in European decision-making. </p> <p>And because we Labour respect in Europe we can take the lead in the reform of Europe. </p> <p>The stronger we are in Europe the stronger will be Britain's voice around the rest of the world. </p> <p>We have a full agenda on world issues for the next parliament. </p> <p>We will tackle the causes of conflict. The self-loading rifle has become the modern weapon of mass destruction. We will support an I international arms amnesty fund to offer development in return for the surrender of firearms. </p> <p>We will propose new rules to tackle the spread of missile technology. </p> <p>We will work to extend the code of conduct on arms sales to central Europe and to north America. </p> <p>We will get the International Criminal Court up and running. Never again will brutal dictators be able to commit crimes against humanity, knowing that there is no court to hold them to account. </p> <p>We will offer to establish in Britain a staff college for the UN on peacekeeping. </p> <p>We will demand reform of the security council. It must represent the world of the 21st century, not the world as it was in the middle of the last century. </p> <p>We will offer a new contract for the British Traveller. Using the latest in communications technology, it will guarantee 24-hour, seven-day access to help, wherever you are in the world. </p> <p>And we will appoint a special envoy on the death penalty. An advocate for the profound moral case against the judicial taking of human life. </p> <p>Those are our priorities for a second term. The priorities of a government that knows that Britain's security, prosperity, and democratic values are strengthened by a healthy international community. </p> <p>I see William Hague has called his new policy \"Believing in Britain\". What a miserable, shrivelled, shrunken thing is the Tory vision of Britain. A country hostile to its neighbours, frightened of foreigners and bigoted about people who come from other continents. </p> <p>We believe in Britain. But we believe in all of Britain. We will not accept sneers at overseas doctors who work hard for our hospitals. We enjoy living in a multi-cultural society. We welcome the strength it gives us in our relations around the world. </p> <p>We believe in British values. Freedom. Justice. Fairness. But we do not accept that those are values for Britain alone. If we want those rights for ourselves, then we should support those rights for others. </p> <p>We believe in a Britain that is comfortable with itself and with its place in the world. Not sliding into isolation. Opting out of its responsibilities. Surrendering its interests. We believe in a confident Britain that rises to its role in the world. A Britain that earns respect. That's the Britain we believe in. </p> <p>And that is what we will offer the people at the election. A Britain that is a leading partner in Europe and a force for good in the world.</p>",
  "<p>Never wished that you were an American? Forget global warming and death row. Forget their ignorance of cricket and their love of gridiron. Think double-chocolate muffins and John Cusack; Brandi Chastain and Marion Jones. And now think of their sporting literature.</p> <p>The country that gave the world women's studies in the 1960s has this year given it Sports Illustrated for Women, a magazine aimed at women who love sport about women who play sport. It is the first magazine of its kind in the US, and it has provoked an astonishing response on the news stand.</p> <p>Missy Dye, from the publicity department, reports that SIFW (aimed at women between 18-34) has a current circulation of 300,000 and is expected to top 400,000 at the beginning of 2001. \"It is above and beyond any expectation of Time Inc [the publishers]. It has blown them away,\" she said.</p> <p>The magazine had a long gestation period. A tester copy was printed early in 1997, under the name Sports Illustrated Women's Sport. It flew out of the shops. Then in 1999 four other special issues were published as the editorial was refined and further research was carried out into what the readers wanted. From the evidence of the July/August issue, what women want isn't just dry reports or lectures on how to train. It contains features on college wrestler Patricia Miranda, basketball player Yolanda Griffith and middle-distance runner Marla Runyan. But it also includes articles on skincare, the best surf outfits around, and eating organically - with, eureka, no mention of diets. Plus letters which probably wouldn't make the cut at Just Seventeen: \"After batting practice my hand is sore for hours. Is something wrong with my swing?\"</p> <p>Oh, and don't forget the horoscopes. Yes, I know they're nonsense, but they're addictive nonsense. And it was a treat after ploughing through pages of go-gettem editorial to learn that despite being \"a wuss at confrontation\" I should learn to \"come on strong to get what I want\". And that I should try rollerskating or line dancing to get in shape. [Take note Ashley Giles, the only piscean in the England Test squad to Pakistan and Sri Lanka.] Anyway, it all seems to go down well with the advertisers. All the big names in sport are there, such as Nike, Reebok, Adidas and Vans. Plus cars (Ford, Suburu and General Motors), chocolate (Kit Kat), Nintendo (Mia Hamm Soccer 64), and, interestingly, the US Army Reserve</p> <p>It isn't perfect. There are more than a couple of advertising features and pages and pages of advertorial masquerading as features. Plus the permanently upbeat tone might irk British readers (for a taster have a look at <a href=\"http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/siforwomen/\">the SIFW website</a>). </p> <p>But it is new and innovative and one step up from anything you'll get over here. Our nearest equivalent is Zest, but that concentrates more on health and beauty rather than sport. </p> <p>What is there for the active woman over here? Not much. Individual sports federations usually produce a newsletter dedicated to their women's section. Every female cricketer registered with the ECB gets a copy of Wicket Women. But sometimes you feel the need for more than a worthy read. Perhaps sports other than just cricket take your fancy. Perhaps you want glamour and substance. Perhaps you need to feel some glossy pages between your fingers.</p> <p>It's not as if there's not the demand. A specialist women's football magazine sells more copies in the UK than Wisden Cricket Monthly. And it wasn't just men who tuned in avidly to the Women's 400m final at Sydney yesterday and are reading about it in today's papers. By punching its weight in America, Sports Illustrated for Women shows that there's a market waiting to be tapped on this side of the Atlantic too. The US version will never have a mass readership over here because of its concentration on American sports, but at the moment it is the best we have. And that's a shame.</p> <p><em>Tanya Aldred is assistant editor of Wisden Cricket Monthly.

  "<a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/labour2000/story/0,7369,373638,00.html\">Blair's speech, part one: 'It's no wonder the government has taken a knock'</a> <p>Today I make a further commitment. </p> <p> Line one of the contract in the next manifesto will be a promise to increase the share of our national wealth spent on education in the next Parliament. </p> <p> Education. Education. Education. Then. Now. And in the future. </p> <p> Again, on health, let me set out the scale of our plans, for now and for a second term. </p> <p> The waiting list pledge has been met. </p> <p> There are 10,000 more nurses in the NHS. </p> <p> Every A&amp;E that needs it is being modernised. </p> <p> The biggest ever hospital building programme is under way. </p> <p> But we all know. 18 years of neglect isn't put right in three years. </p> <p> Earlier this year we got the money to plan for a five year record rise in NHS spending. But we are New Labour. We don't just spend. </p> <p> Alan Milburn and I sat down with people in the NHS and said it's a deal: we provide the cash, you rise to the challenge of modernising the NHS. They responded magnificently. </p> <p> Our NHS plan is something the party can be proud of. The NHS was the greatest achievement of the post-war Labour government. It was based on a single, clear, enduring value: that healthcare should be based on need not ability to pay. Some objected to that principle then. Some urge us to abandon it now. But this party, the Labour party will never abandon what was one of the greatest civilising acts of emancipation this country has ever known. </p> <p> Under the plan, for the first time a system of inspection and accountability for all parts of the NHS, with new money to reward good performance. </p> <p> For the first time, nurses and other health professionals given the bigger roles that their qualifications and expertise deserve. </p> <p> For the first time local health services and local social services brought closer together in one organisation. </p> <p> For the first time, the NHS and the private sector in a proper partnership to deliver healthcare. </p> <p> For the first time, money set aside specifically to get rid of the dirty corridors, the poor food, the mixed sex wards which demoralise patients and staff. </p> <p> For the first time, new consultants trained within the NHS, paid for by the taxpayer, will give the early years of their service exclusively to National Health Service patients. </p> <p> Today, as we set out the next steps, I want to focus on cancer. </p> <p> There will be nobody in this hall, or watching from their homes, who has not seen a friend or family member struck down by cancer. </p> <p> As things stand, one in every four people in this country will die of cancer. </p> <p> Under the plan we publish tomorrow, there will be 1000 more cancer specialists over the next six years - up nearly a third. </p> <p> 295 new scanners and radio-therapy machines so that for the first time the NHS can meet proper equipment standards for diagnosing and treating cancer. </p> <p> By 2003 for the first time the government will be matching pound for pound charity funding for cancer research. </p> <p> Cancer patients in all parts of the country will get the right drugs at the right time, regardless of where they live. The postcode lottery ended. Waiting times will be cut. Maximum two weeks from GP appointment to first hospital appointment for suspected urgent cases. And, as we increase the number of specialists, a maximum wait of one month from diagnosis to treatment starting. </p> <p> And because breast cancer kills 11,000 women every year, because it causes so much pain and suffering among Britain's families, we will extend breast cancer screening to all women aged over 65, helping an extra 400,000 women by 2004. </p> <p> Then on transport, in July John Prescott and Gus Macdonald set out in detail Britain's first ever transport plan, a unique 10 year \u00a3180 billion partnership between public and private sector to renew our transport system. </p> <p> A massive programme for the second term. It will take time. Investment. And a Labour government to see it through. </p> <p> The Conservatives have made their choice. </p> <p> They are committed to \u00a316bn of cuts in our investment. </p> <p> When they made this commitment, I asked for research on what sort of things you'd have to cut over a 12 month period to deliver on a \u00a316bn cuts guarantee. Back came the answer. </p> <p> 20,000 doctors. Cut. </p> <p> Plus 20,000 prison officers. Cut. </p> <p> Plus 40,000 nurses. Cut. </p> <p> Plus 40,000 teachers. Cut. </p> <p> Plus 40,000 police officers. Cut under the Tory cuts guarantee. </p> <p> And then: 20 hospitals. Shut. </p> <p> 150 secondary schools. Shut. 500 primary schools. Shut under the Tory cuts guarantee. </p> <p> And we've still got five billion pounds to go. How will they get there? </p> <p> The biggest ever rise in child benefit. Cut. </p> <p> Free TV licences for 3 million pensioners. Cut. </p> <p> The \u00a3150 winter fuel allowance. Cut under the Tory cuts guarantee. </p> <p> 1200 intensive care beds. Cut. </p> <p> Free eye tests for pensioners. Cut. 250 cancer scanners. Cut. </p> <p> Half a million nursery places. Cut. 100,000 childcare places. Cut under the Tory cuts guarantee. </p> <p> And just to round it up to \u00a316 billion, the country's entire arts and sports budget. Cut under the Tory cuts guarantee. </p> <p> And in every constituency, in every part of this country, we will force every Tory candidate to say where the cuts will fall. </p> <p> The fourth big choice: a government with the strength to build strong communities, or a government that believes there is no such thing in society. </p> <p> Crime, anti-social behaviour, racial intolerance, drug abuse, destroy families and communities. They destroy the very respect for others on which society is founded. They blight the life chances of thousands of young people and the quality of life of millions more. </p> <p> Fail to confront this evil and we will never build a Britain where everyone can succeed. </p> <p> So we invest to give opportunity. Not just in jobs and services. </p> <p> Today we set out plans to invest \u00a3750million of lottery money in schools and community sport as part of a \u00a31billion investment over three years. </p> <p> It's a policy we have put together with Trevor Brooking, chairman of Sport England, who has flown here from Sydney and who believes passionately, as I do, that this is not just a sports policy. It's a health policy, an education policy, an anti-crime policy, an anti-drugs policy. </p> <p> By acknowledging the duty to care, we earn the right to be tough on crime. 4 out of 10 violent crimes are alcohol related. Half of property crime drug-related. </p> <p> It is time for zero tolerance of the yob culture. </p> <p> Time to stand up for the pensioner afraid to go out. Time to stand up for the single mothers scared to walk to the shops. Time to stand up to the thugs and the bullies. </p> <p> Time to tighten bail to deal with the absurdity of people released in the morning committing offences in the afternoon. Time to give the police powers to close pubs where there is fighting. </p> <p> Time to give them powers to ban drink in public places. </p> <p> Time to give them the power to impose curfews on children up to 16 and time to use them. </p> <p> Time to give them the power without the hassle of endless forms and court bureaucracy, to issue fixed penalty fines for loutish behaviour. </p> <p> Time to give offenders on drugs a choice: get treatment or lose your liberty because society needs protection from you. </p> <p> These measures require legislation. So will the new and sweeping powers we intend to give to the police and customs to investigate organised crime and to confiscate their assets. </p> <p> If they need further powers, they will get them. </p> <p> You don't beat today's drug gangs by applying the Queensberry rules. It is time the law enforcement agencies were able to do as much damage to organised crime as organised crime does to our communities. </p> <p> We have increased funding for victim support, and given special help to victims of rape and sexual offences, but we need to do more. </p> <p> - They should get full information about the progress of the case. </p> <p> - About the sentence, and about the release of the criminal. </p> <p> - Proper compensation, backed by a Victims' Ombudsman. </p> <p> And, I believe that the victim of a crime should be able to give a written assessment of the impact of the crime upon them, which should be presented in open court, and taken into account when sentencing decisions are made. </p> <p> Standing up to criminals. Standing up for victims. Another big project for the second term of a Labour government. </p> <p> The fifth choice: a government that leads in the world, or a government that retreats into isolation. </p> <p> This is a world moving closer together. In money and trade; the environment; defence and security; the war against drugs and crime; even today the call for lower oil prices: strength comes through partnership; influence through international engagement. </p> <p> Standing up for Britain means standing up for our armed services. </p> <p> Standing up for Britain means know we are stronger with the US if we are stronger in Europe, and stronger in Europe if we are stronger with the US. </p> <p> Standing up for Britain means standing up for British jobs and British industry. </p> <p> On the Euro, standing up for Britain means taking the decision in the interests of Britain, not the interests of the internal warfare inside the Tory party. </p> <p> I believe we should join if the economics are right. At present, they aren't. </p> <p> But the choice at the election is not whether we join: that decision is for the people in a referendum. </p> <p> The issue is: do we rule out joining? </p> <p> Do we rule out even the option? </p> <p> How is that standing up for Britain, Britain's jobs, Britain's industry, the living standards of Britain's people? </p> <p> And standing up for Britain means standing up for our values overseas, in Sierra Leone, in Kosovo. </p> <p> And I say to Milosevic. You lost. Go. Your country and the world has suffered enough. </p> <p> These are the choices we make. </p> <p> These are our second term plans. </p> <p> A ten year plan for a modern NHS. The transformation of secondary education. </p> <p> A cradle to grave poverty strategy. </p> <p> A plan to harness new technology to spread prosperity to all. A plan to make our streets safe and our society strong. A 10 year plan for modern transport. </p> <p> The next steps to full employment. </p> <p> This is a programme worth fighting for. A second term more radical than the first. A quickening of the pace of reform. The next steps on our journey. All based on our enduring mission, to offer everyone, not just the privileged few, the chance to succeed. </p> <p> And lighting our path is this belief: that today a strong economy and a strong society are two sides of the same coin. </p> <p> To succeed as an economy we develop the talents of all. </p> <p> To be a fair society, we give opportunity to all. </p> <p> The political consequences are historic; self-interest and the common good are at long last in alliance. </p> <p> Look at the irony of the Tory years. </p> <p> The Tories who said only they could manage the economy ended up with boom and bust. </p> <p> The Tory party that said it would get tough on benefit claimants, ended up spending more on social security than schools and hospitals put together. </p> <p> The Tory party that said it would stand up for the family, presided over more instability, more single parents on benefit, more truancy, more juvenile crime than any in history. </p> <p> Why? Because they offered short-term tax cuts that could not be sustained rather than investing for the long-term. </p> <p> Because they thought there was no such thing as society. </p> <p> In the world of the 80s that might have been cruel; in the 21st century it simply won't work. </p> <p> Do you know how much we save from almost 1 million fewer welfare claimants since we took power. \u00a34 billion per annum. Enough for 75,000 nurses and 70,000 teachers. </p> <p> Do you know how much it would cost to take out private medical insurance, as the Tories want? Over \u00a31500 a year for the average family. </p> <p> Do you know the cost to the British economy of transport congestion a year? The equivalent of 8p on your income tax. </p> <p> Do you know why we say this is a learn more, earn more world? Because a graduate earns 40 % more than the average. </p> <p> On your side for the Tories means nodding along with your prejudices - English language lessons for foreign doctors - you know they're not talking about the Swiss. </p> <p> But really being on your side is to be there with you on the big questions, on the fundamentals. </p> <p> What began as a moral crusade is now also the path to prosperity. What started as a belief in the equal worth of all is also a programme for wealth creation. </p> <p> Realism and idealism at last in harmony. </p> <p> So when the Tories say: we'll cut Labour's investment and give you tax cuts, it's a fool's game. We will cut tax for people as we can, but will do it in a way that lasts not at the expense of the very stability and investment on which the wealth and security of millions of families depend. </p> <p> So that is my explanation. That's why I won't take the easy way. Because that way we cannot reach our journey's end. </p> <p> And all that really stands between us and our destination is confidence. And trust. </p> <p> The confidence that gives us strength to make the choices; the trust that there is a vision, an end to believe in. </p> <p> Don't tell me that a country with our history and heritage, that today boasts six of the top ten businesses in the whole of Europe, with London the top business city in Europe, that is a world leader in technology and communication and the businesses of the future, that under us has overtaken France and Italy to become the fourth largest economy in the world, that has the language of the new economy, more brilliant artists, actors and directors than any comparable country in the world, some of the best scientists and inventors in the world, the best armed forces in the world, the best teachers and doctors and nurses, the best people any nation could wish for. </p> <p> Don't tell me with all that going for us that we do not have the spirit to meet all the challenges before us. </p> <p> For that is another choice; confidence or cynicism. All we need is the confidence to make the right choice for the future. </p> <p> Just as we did in the party so, on a larger scale, the same is true for Britain. We are on a journey of renewal. Before us lies a path strewn with the challenges of change. </p> <p> But the purpose of our journey is not to lose our values as a nation: but to make them live on. </p> <p> And for us, this government, this party that believes passionately in a Britain where everyone not just a few get a chance to succeed, and knows the Tories will only take us backwards, we now know: </p> <p> We are in a fight and it's a fight I relish. </p> <p> For it is a fight for the future, the heart and the soul of our country. </p> <p> A fight for fairness. A fight for jobs. A fight for our schools. A fight for our hospitals. A fight for a new vision in which the old conflict between prosperity and social justice is finally banished to the history books in which it belongs. </p> <p> We do not lie down in the testing times. </p> <p> We hold firm. We listen and we lead. </p> <p> We can be confident in our policies, confident in the record we will put before the British people. </p> <p> Confident that we will repay the trust the British people put in us. </p> <p> Confident that we share their basic decent instincts and values. </p> <p> Confident that we are winning the big arguments on the big issues. </p> <p> Stability. Or boom and bust. </p> <p> Jobs. Or unemployment. </p> <p> Investment in schools and hospitals. Or cuts. </p> <p> Leadership and engagement in the world. Or weakness and sour isolation. </p> <p> Our journey's end: a Britain where any child born in this millennium, whatever their background, race or creed, wherever they live, whoever their parents, is able to make the most of the God-given ability they bring into this world. </p> <p> That journey is a journey worth making. </p> <p> A fight worth fighting. </p> <p> A fight we must win.</p>",
  "No prime minister, no party leader, could have a better deputy than John Prescott. <p> You know why the Tories hate him: because he started out as a seaman, steward on a ship, rose to be deputy prime minister and has never hidden or been anything other than totally proud of where he came from. </p> <p> And you know why I like him: because not once in the last two weeks has he reminded me that when he was in charge in August we were 20 points ahead in the polls. </p> <p> I set out today the next steps of our journey to renew our country. </p> <p> Prosperity spreading to all parts of Britain. </p> <p> Secondary schools transformed. </p> <p> A modern NHS. </p> <p> A 21st century transport system. </p> <p> The yob culture tackled. </p> <p> On the way to ending child poverty. </p> <p> On the road to full employment. </p> <p> The people's priorities our priorities. </p> <p> That is a second term vision worth fighting for. </p> <p> Our destination: a Britain where, in a world of change, everyone not just a few gets the chance to succeed. </p> <p> For me, the large majority we won was never a reason to do the job quickly; but to do it properly. </p> <p> We knew: first base was getting the fundamentals in place. </p> <p> We said we would sort the economy out. We have. </p> <p> The strongest British economy for decades, delivered by this New Labour government. </p> <p> We said we'd get people off benefit and into work. We are. 1 million more jobs. </p> <p> We said we'd invest in schools and hospitals. It is happening. </p> <p> And because we chose to invest; because we have in this country tens of thousands of dedicated hard working teachers as determined as we are to give every child a chance to succeed, last week, Britain had the best primary school results it has ever seen. </p> <p> That is what I call: delivering on the fundamentals. </p> <p> And I could go on and give a list of all the other promises kept and change delivered. </p> <p> Over a million children out of poverty. </p> <p> This government leading the way on the environment at Kyoto. Devolution to the people of Scotland, Wales and London. </p> <p> Progress in Northern Ireland. Free eye tests for pensioners. </p> <p> Higher benefits for disabled children. 150,000 lone parents into work. </p> <p> Lowest business taxes. Record rises in child benefit. </p> <p> I could go on and on. Because we should be proud of our record. Not self-satisfied. Never complacent. But plain proud because the firm foundations we promised to lay are in place. </p> <p> But this is not a time for lists. But for setting out the big choices facing Britain and for dialogue. </p> <p> I'm the prime minister that's supposed to be the great reader of public opinion. After the events of two weeks ago, it's no wonder the government has taken a knock. It happened on my watch and I take responsibility. </p> <p> So: what do we make of it? </p> <p> Three years ago, Britain was desperate to get the Tories out. The people liked the look of us. We were a breath of fresh air. New faces, new ideas, new policies. </p> <p> In some areas we've exceeded expectations. Let us be honest, a few people doubted the economy would be stronger under Labour. But it is. They like the 1m new jobs. They believe we are trying to make progress on schools and hospitals. </p> <p> But for many families life's still a struggle. </p> <p> It's tough, balancing work and family. </p> <p> Jobs can be insecure. </p> <p> There's the mortgage to pay; the holiday to save for. Inflation may be lower but the kid's trainers don't get any cheaper. </p> <p> Then, people hear the 20 second clip on the news. </p> <p> They see the ding-dong at prime minister's questions.</p> <p> They try to make sense of the swirling mass of news and comment in the 24-hour media age. </p> <p> And they think: you're not listening. What's it got to do with me? Where is this journey's end? And a fog descends on the very dialogue between Government and people necessary to get there. </p> <p> And, yes, there are things we have done that have made people angry and we should be open enough to admit it. </p> <p> The dome. Hindsight is a wonderful thing, and if I had my time again, I would have listened to those who said governments shouldn't try to run big visitor attractions. </p> <p> 75p. I tell you now, as Gordon made crystal clear yesterday, we get the message. </p> <p> But I believe that when people reflect, on the big fundamentals that determine our future - the economy, jobs, public services - we are doing the right thing, and we are on the right track for Britain; and the last thing this country needs is a return to Tory government. </p> <p> Let me come direct to the fuel crisis. </p> <p> I owe you an explanation. </p> <p> Yes, petrol is expensive. </p> <p> But of the 14p rise since the Budget last year, 12 pence has been in the world oil price. Which is why these protests have taken place all over the world. </p> <p> It's true that it's cheaper elsewhere in Europe. </p> <p> But VAT is often higher there. Income tax is higher. Business taxes are higher. There are road tolls and higher national insurance charges. </p> <p> All in all, Britain has the lowest overall tax burden of any large industrialised nation in the world except Japan and the USA. In the USA, you don't have the NHS. </p> <p> It's true that there will be extra revenues coming to government as a result of higher oil prices. But they nowhere near cover the protesters' demands. </p> <p> And there's something more. </p> <p> I am listening to people's anger over fuel duties. For hauliers and farmers to say nothing of ordinary motorists, there is real hardship. </p> <p> But I have also had to listen over under-funding in the NHS. </p> <p> Over extra investment in schools. </p> <p> Over more police on the beat. </p> <p> Over public transport. </p> <p> I am listening over mortgages, where low interest rates can only be maintained if disciplined public finances are kept. </p> <p> I am also listening to pensioners who believe the government should give them a greater share of the country's prosperity. </p> <p> Our first priority was to help the 2 million pensioners, many of them elderly women, who depend on income support. I make no apology for helping the poorest first and neither should this Party. </p> <p> Through the winter allowance, now \u00a3150, and free TV licences for over 75s, we helped people with their most pressing costs. </p> <p> We rejected returning to the earnings link. For the next two or three years we could afford it; but 10, 15 years down the line, it would have imposed a huge financial burden on a future generation that would have been unfair to them. </p> <p> We want to do more for middle and lower income pensioners. You do not meet long term need by giving the wealthiest the same help as the poorest. </p> <p> But I know there are pensioners not on benefit, who have saved all their lives but are not by any stretch of the imagination wealthy, and for whom the basic state pension and other government help is essential. It is right they share in the nation's wealth. </p> <p> I am listening. I hear. And I will act. </p> <p> The point I'm making is this. </p> <p> The real world is full of competing causes. </p> <p> Most of them good. </p> <p> Most of them deserving. </p> <p> Many of them heart-rending. </p> <p> And it's not an arrogant government that chooses priorities. </p> <p> It's an irresponsible government that fails to choose. </p> <p> The test of leadership in politics is not how eloquently you say yes. </p> <p> It's how you explain why you're saying no. </p> <p> To be in touch is to be in sympathy. </p> <p> To be in government is to decide. </p> <p> And would it ever be right to choose a priority simply on the basis of a fuel blockade? What of those who can't protest; whose voice isn't supported by the media; who go neglected unless we speak for them? </p> <p> So I am listening. </p> <p> But I was also elected to lead. </p> <p> And if we want to reach our journey's end - that strong, fair and prosperous Britain for all - there are choices to be made. </p> <p> There are forks in the road, where which way we take determines the future lives of millions of people. They are decisions of destiny and I would like to explain them. </p> <p> The first big choice: a government with the strength to deliver stability, or a government that takes the country back to boom and bust. </p> <p> Without economic strength, there will never be a Britain where everyone can succeed. </p> <p> Remember the late 80s/early 90s, interest rates at 10% for four years, 15% for a year. One million families in negative equity. Record repossessions. </p> <p> Contrary to the myth, we inherited an economy trapped in a cycle of boom and bust; interest rates above those in our main competitors; and a big budget deficit. </p> <p> That was them after 18 years. After 3 years of us, ask yourselves this. Why has this country now got the lowest inflation rate in Europe? </p> <p> Employment and vacancies at record levels? </p> <p> The budget deficit, turned into the highest surplus in any major European country? </p> <p> It is not luck that we enjoy this economic strength. It is not coincidence. </p> <p> It is the result of choices, hard choices, taken by this government. By Gordon Brown, one of the most inspired chancellors this country has seen. Bank of England independence. Opposed by the Conservatives. </p> <p> Sorting out the nation's finances. Opposed by the Conservatives. </p> <p> The cheek of these Tories arguing about how we spend the surplus. </p> <p> Let us remind them. </p> <p> In May 1997, we didn't have a surplus. We had a national debt so large we were paying as much in interest payments on the debt as on schools and police put together. </p> <p> Today the Tories are back with exactly the plan of 10 years ago. </p> <p> You don't need me to predict it. We all experienced it. Don't ever let them con us into boom and bust again.</p> <p> The second big choice: a government with the strength to help people through change, or a government that leaves you to fend for yourself. </p> <p> Never forget: in 18 Tory years, unemployment trebled. Families of three generations with nobody bringing in a wage. Record youth unemployment. And what did they say: it was a price worth paying. </p> <p> Unemployment is never a price worth paying. </p> <p> The New Deal has helped nearly a million people with work or training, the largest ever jobs programme Britain has seen. </p> <p> The Working Families' Tax Credit makes work pay for over a million families. Childcare and training has helped 150,000 women find work or get a better job. </p> <p> A women wrote to me recently and said that, for the first time in her life, thanks to the Working Families' Tax Credit, she could afford a holiday and thanks to the Social Chapter, she was entitled to one. </p> <p> And at long last a national statutory minimum wage has given 1\u00bd million people the dignity of a decent living wage. </p> <p> And we have introduced the democratic right, delivered after 100 years of trying, to be represented by a trade union should you want it. </p> <p> That was our choice. Not to leave you at the mercy of markets. Not to walk by. Not to say: tough, sink or swim. </p> <p> Every single one of those measures was opposed by the Conservatives. </p> <p> Every single one fought against, tooth and nail. </p> <p> That was their choice. And though they say they support the national minimum wage now, does anyone believe them? Their policies may change every five minutes. Their prejudices will never change.</p> <p> And in the next stage we need to do more. Because the pace of change will quicken. It's not just poorer families that need help. To give everyone the chance to succeed, right in the heartlands of middle Britain, there are families and businesses that will need that helping hand. </p> <p> And because of the scale of what we are doing, and the scale of our ambition, let me set out in detail what we are doing, and what we will do in the future. </p> <p> Because 90% of new jobs will need skills with computers, there will be 6000 centres round Britain, giving access to the internet and help with technology. Everyone will get an 80% discount on computer courses, the unemployed will get it for free. There will be 1000 more technology centres for small businesses or the self-employed. </p> <p> Because we want to stay ahead in the new technologies we are investing \u00a32\u00bc billion over five years in British science, the largest investment since the 1960s. </p> <p> Because we know small businesses are a big part of the future, we are setting up venture capital funds in every region, tax breaks for investment, cuts in small business tax and the new Small Business Service to act as their advocate and protector in government. </p> <p> And because we know the danger that in a changing world new forms of inequality and social exclusion are created: the Sure Start programme - \u00a3500 million - to help children in poverty; a new Careers Service for school leavers; cutting homelessness and helping the homeless get jobs; a \u00a31 billion programme to renew deprived neighbourhoods; and extending the New Deal in the unemployment blackspots of Britain. </p> <p> I want to be the first prime minister in 40 years to stand up and say; Britain is back at full employment. </p> <p> But it all depends on having the strength to make the choice. </p> <p> Not by leaping aboard every passing bandwagon. </p> <p> There's Mr Hague. </p> <p> Standing around waiting for a bandwagon. </p> <p> Then three come along at once. </p> <p> There he was, week after week, glued to the box, to see who was voted out of Big Brother. </p> <p> And then announced it had always been Tory policy to throw them out. </p> <p> Opportunism always knocks for William Hague. </p> <p> You want tax cuts? Have them. </p> <p> Spending rises? Have them too. </p> <p> It all makes sense after 14 pints. Everything makes sense after 14 pints. </p> <p> John Redwood looks sane. Michael Portillo looks loyal. </p> <p> After 14 pints, even William Hague looks like a prime minister. </p> <p> The third big choice: a government with the strength to invest for the long term, or a government that cuts our public services. </p> <p> For 18 years, Britain suffered chronic under-investment in our public services. It held people back; it reduced opportunity. How could we reach a Britain where everyone can succeed, when, in May '97 half, literally half, of all 11-year-olds failed their basic tests? </p> <p> Or the NHS was on its knees. </p> <p> Or our transport system was the poor man of Europe? </p> <p> So to get to the next stage of our journey. </p> <p> Our education, health and transport plans represent the most radical reform in public services over ten years any government has produced since the War. </p> <p> So again, let me set out in detail the journey so far, and the plans for a second term. </p> <p> So far, 11,000 schools with new buildings. </p> <p> 120,000 more free nursery places. </p> <p> As well as the best ever primary school tests, three hundred thousand fewer infants in classes of more than 30. </p> <p> 300 more specialist secondary schools, improving their results at twice the average for other schools. </p> <p> A \u00a3200m reform programme to improve inner city comprehensives. </p> <p> A billion pound investment in our teachers to reward excellence in the classroom. </p> <p> But this is only the beginning. The next stage on the journey requires not only excellent primary schools but first-class secondary schools. </p> <p> By 2004, there will be one thousand specialist schools. </p> <p> An extra billion pound investment in ICT, to ensure one computer to every five children in our secondary schools. </p> <p> Catch-up tuition for all 11- and 12 year-olds who arrive without good literacy and numeracy. </p> <p> New targets for 14- and 16-year-olds. </p> <p> Better incentives for staying on at school, and an overhaul of further education to raise standards. </p> <p> New bursaries for student teachers of up to \u00a310,000, with already a 50% rise in graduate applications. </p> <p> And all these are policies that flow from our central belief that every single child deserves an equal chance. That every child is a unique asset to be brought to their fullest potential. It is why we are in this party. It is why education is the passion of this government. </p> <p> In our manifesto, line one of our contract with the people promised to increase the share of our national wealth spent on education during this Parliament. </p> <p> A promise made. A promise kept. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Guardian/labour2000/story/0,7369,373640,00.html\">Blair's speech, part two: 'We are in a fight and it's a fight I relish'</a></p>",
  "<p>Oil prices struggled to remain above $30 a barrel yesterday as the European Union hinted that it was prepared to follow the lead of the United States in releasing crude from its strategic reserve </p> <p>With EU finance ministers to discuss on Friday the possible use of their reserves, oil prices fell below $30 a barrel at one stage in London yesterday as dealers anticipated action by rich western countries and the Opec oil cartel to increase the supply of fuel. </p> <p>G7 officials in Prague on the eve of the World Bank/IMF summit said they were happy with the reaction of the commodities markets, which left some analysts predicting a price of $25 a barrel before the end of the year. </p> <p>The fall in oil was in contrast to the cautious mood in the foreign exchange markets, where the euro drifted slightly lower once it became clear that the G7 industrial countries were not going to repeat Friday's intervention. </p> <p>Fears that the Danish referendum on Thursday might lead to renewed downward pressure on the single currency pushed the rate against the dollar back to where it was sitting before central banks and finance ministries spent around $7bn in their surprise move last week. </p> <p>In the absence of new action by the G7 yesterday, it was left to Jean-Claude Trichet, the governor of the Bank of France, to prevent the euro falling against the dollar to below 87 cents, when he said that the decline had gone too far. The euro closed at $0.872 in London after starting the day half a cent higher, but was still well above its record low of just under $0.845 last week. </p> <p>James Wolfensohn, president of the World Bank, yesterday became the latest global leader to warn of the dangers of high oil prices. </p> <p>He said poor countries were facing a double blow of higher energy costs and lower commodity prices, particularly for cocoa and coffee. </p> <p>The west's leading think-tank, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, said yesterday that oil prices of $30 a barrel this year and $33 a barrel next would shave 0.4 of a percentage point off global growth. </p> <p>In the markets yesterday, Brent crude futures followed Friday's $1.50 fall by dropping a further $1.35 to $29.90 in morning trading. </p> <p>Oil futures were also lower in New York, where the decision by the Clinton administration to draw down the reserve, coupled with hopes that G7 pressure will lead to further supply increases from Opec, offset fears that a tough winter would leave the US short of fuel. </p> <p>The release from the US strategic petroleum reserve was announced by the energy secretary, Bill Richardson, after the markets closed on Friday, but prices had already fallen from 10-year peaks, $34.98 on Brent and $37.80 on American Nymex crude, over the week as markets anticipated the initiative. </p> <p>Some traders said the impact of the release, the first since the 1990-1991 Gulf crisis, could be increased because it would coincide with the Opec producers' latest output increase of 800,000 barrels a day, which will start reaching the markets on October 1. </p> <p>Under the release, oil from the reserve would effectively be lent to oil companies, which would replace it at a later date. </p> <p>The European commission spokesman Gilles Gantelet said that discussions were under way among EU partners about the possible use of strategic oil reserves to combat high prices. </p> <p>He said, however, that \"for the moment, there is no intention at a European level to use the reserves\".</p>",
  "<p>The seasons are all changing, <br></p> <p>All because of us. <br></p> <p>Don't you think it's time, <br></p> <p>that we all made a fuss? <br></p> <p> So rap the children from St Paulinus C of E Primary School in Crayford, Kent, who last week received the Millennium Marque from the Tidy Britain Group for their environmental work - the only school to be so honoured. </p> <p>The school is blessed with a little wooded area, and until about seven years ago this was just used as a short-cut to get to the playing field. A group of parents cleared away the rubbish from this overgrown and neglected corner of the grounds and marked out a proper pathway. That was the beginning of a sustainability project that has gone from strength to strength. </p> <p>On entering the school there is a wall covered with certificates - from Bexley in Bloom through to the prestigious Eco-Schools Award, evidence of the school's commitment towards green issues. </p> <p>The grounds are not huge, but with the well-planned layout they give the impression that a small child could wander for hours round ponds and through wooded secret gardens, or just sit and watch the birds and butterflies. Every aspect of the school is reviewed by the pupils for its environmental impact in order to identify targets for action and improvement. </p> <p>A plan is then drawn up involving the children, teachers, parents and local community, which is constantly monitored and evaluated. Different groups have responsibility for particular tasks: in the bird garden, where feeders of every shape and size are hung, the children in year six are responsible for watering the flowers, but the reception class fills the birdbath. This year reception have planted a hazel walk and bower, which, by the time they leave the school, will have grown into another established feature of the grounds. </p> <p>Projects are designed with this aim in mind, and the children have a sense of shared ownership in the school. Many still visit after they have left, wanting not just to check on how their own work has matured, but to see what the new kids have been up to. They also often initiate sustainability projects in their secondary schools. </p> <p>Environmental issues are integrated into the national curriculum, touching every subject. A regular science class feature is pond dipping - taking a jar of pond water and examining it and learning about the contents. The butterfly garden is planted and cared for by the children. On the wall are the descriptions and models of the different butterflies so that they can be easily identified. </p> <p>The pupils have carried out projects on waste recycling and have a policy of using both sides of the paper; the saving of energy is another high priority, with projects to design posters to remind each other to switch off the lights. The use, recycling and waste of water have found their way into maths and geography. And the environment is used in all areas of literacy, even if it is just sitting in the garden listening to a story. </p> <p>The grounds are treated as another classroom, to be appreciated all year round, not just in the summer. Outside of school hours are the Twitchers club and the Greenfingers club, the latter run by a parent whose children have now left St Paulinus - it isn't just the pupils who find it hard to leave. </p> <p>The school is very open and shares its grounds with the community and particularly with a nearby special needs school. With this in mind, the woodchip paths in the wood are wide enough to accommodate a wheelchair. Again it is the pupils' responsibility to maintain the paths, making sure they are accessible. </p> <p>The local business community is also involved, and in amongst the labels for buddleia and lavender are plaques commemorating donations from Woolwich plc and benches from Sainsbury's and Barclays. </p> <p>The Eco-Schools project aims to bring up young people to act responsibly, and acknowledge what is happening in their environment - and in turn to influence their parents and peers. Bexley council wants to encourage positive citizens. The impact across the whole school has been positive, with academic results giving as much pleasure to the parents as the green fingers give to the pupils. </p> <p>The children at St Paulinus are proud of their achievements and Nicola and Vicki from year six, members of the eco-committee, needed no prompting to offer a guided tour, even in torrential rain. There was no way the eco-rap was not going to be performed for a visitor. The eco- committee is made up of pupils, teachers, governors and parents, but the children have a major input and it is another way they can express their views and know that their ideas are valued and taken into account. </p> <p>The various projects have resulted in financial savings for the school as the managing of utilities has come under the eco-committee's eagle eye and a policy of environmental purchasing has been agreed. </p> <p>New headteacher Adam Higgins has already been well briefed on the current projects, which include a raised viewing platform and a plan for the edge of the playground. He is beginning to sound like his pupils. </p> <p>\u0095 To apply for an Eco-Schools pack (which includes a handbook on how to run a scheme like this, environmental review booklet, and curriculum ideas), contact The Tidy Britain Group, Elizabeth House, The Pier, Wigan, WN3 4EX.

  "<p>Somewhere out there, far from the teeming corridors of the state system, deaf to politicians' talk of \"excellence\" and \"performance\", there is an education promised land. True, it exists mainly in the dreams of anxious parents, but what a pleasant place it is. There is freedom of expression, yet chairs never arc through classroom airspace. Knowledge is treasured, yet young minds are not oppressed by achievement targets, and neither are teachers. Schools are communities rather than institutions, and every child is seen as a special individual rather than just another inmate in some government-controlled academy of stress. </p> <p>This Saturday in central London, at the second annual Alternatives in Education Fair, a diverse group of educators, campaigners and parents will gather in the shared conviction that such a promised land not only exists, but that all children should be delivered there. The two best-known alternative education philosophies will be represented: Steiner-Waldorf, whose fellowship encompasses 26 schools and 45 kindergartens in Britain and Ireland, and the followers of Dr Maria Montessori. Also providing a presence will be Summerhill, the Suffolk secondary whose policy of making lessons voluntary recently survived a nasty brush with Ofsted. </p> <p>Those are the big names, but a growing number of smaller operators will also be espousing their own distinctive ways of making learning in some way more spiritual, less prescriptive, less impersonal - \"holistic\" is a favoured term. If there is a common theme, it is that small is beautiful. The charity Human Scale Education (HSE), which represents alternative schools and organises the fair, campaigns for small classes, smaller schools, and large schools to be \"restructured into smaller units\". </p> <p>The wish to create \"learning experiences that will develop in young people the attitudes, skills and knowledge to shape a fairer world\" is, of course, wholly admirable. But what are such schools actually like? The principles informing them can also trigger suspicions, not only among traditionalists who smell zealots and cranks. Liberal parents sympathetic to \"alternative\" ideals may also have their doubts. Is it necessarily true that virtue follows smallness? Can smallness also lead to small-mindedness, a suspicion of diversity and of majority ways? What exactly are some alternative schools an alternative to? </p> <p>The possible answers to the last question demonstrate the dangers of generalisation. Many one-off alternative schools demonstrate an intellectual position in action, just as the Steiners and Montessoris do. For example, the Educare Small School, a primary in Kingston-upon-Thames, is described by its co-founder Liz Steinthal as \"a reflection of my philosophy of teaching.\" A maximum of 50 pupils, whose parents pay \u00a3910 per term, follow the national curriculum, but also do lots of art, drama and meditation. \"It allows children to learn how to be still and silent,\" Steinthal explains, \"and how to recognise what is going on inside them instead of just what's going on around them.\" </p> <p>By contrast, the founding impulse behind the Abinger Hammer Village School, a primary near Dorking, was simply to avoid closure. It was due to be shut by the local authority in 1982, but local residents raised funds and have kept it going. The school is now financed by a trust and vigorous fundraising efforts, and attendance is free. There is no over-arching ideology, just a straightforward conviction that a village school is essential to village life. That said, trustees' secretary Shirley Corke is clear about its values: \"We like the idea of it being an unschooly school. It's not that we don't teach them anything! I sometimes help out by giving a French lesson, which gets them used to all the funny noises! But I'm not keen on children sitting down all day, struggling with too much reading and writing.\" </p> <p>The school has just one teacher and only a dozen pupils. The oldest is the sole member of year four and as such stands unchallenged as head girl. Hammond is pleased that working with such tiny numbers means she can deliver tailored learning , and thinks the modest numbers are a positive advantage in terms of social skills. \"They're like a large family. The big ones look after the little ones, and it all helps with sensitivity and communication.\" </p> <p>The failure of mainstream schools to be sensitive towards pupils with certain special needs lies behind some of the more specialist schools under the \"alternative\" umbrella. Far removed from Abinger Hammer, Home School of Stoke Newington in north London began life nine years ago as one boy and his mum - teacher Catherine Allen, now Home School's principal. She was certain her boy would flounder in a conventional secondary. Dyslexic, dreamy and, his mother says, \"unconsciously setting himself up as a victim,\" he'd already struggled at primary school, and had been baffled by basic rules. \"He couldn't understand why he had to ask if he could go to the toilet,\" Allen recalls. \"He thought that was mad.\" </p> <p>Her son's sense of disconnection was underlined for him by the contrast between himself and his twin sister. Where she was tuned-in and confident, he was \"busy off with the birds\". So while her daughter moved up smoothly into secondary schooling, Allen gave up her career and began teaching her son at home. \"Educationally, that was fine,\" she says. \"But where were the mates?\" After a couple of years she placed an ad in the local paper. Her son described the day he was first joined by two additional pupils as the best one of his life. </p> <p>Most lessons take place in two rooms of Allen's terraced house. There is lots of artwork, plenty of books, computers, a piano, some old-fashioned school desks and a warm atmosphere. Fees are \u00a32,700 per term. The school has nine teachers, most part-time, and 10 pupils - all boys, though girls are welcome. Most suffer from dyslexia, though the school also takes children who are school phobic or have been bullied. </p> <p>A sympathetic inspector described Home School's pupils as \"mainstream refugees\". Allen thinks that's about right: they aren't children who'd qualify for a special needs statement, yet a normal secondary school simply can't give them what they need. And maybe the description could bear a broader application. The growing interest in alternative and home schooling suggests that more children and parents are seeking refuge from an education culture increasingly dominated by a tests-and-targets ethos and the spectre of disaffection and decay. </p> <p>Do the alternatives have the answer? HSE coordinator Fiona Carnie emphasises that her organisation wants to see the most innovative values of the alternative movement backed with public money and practised at the heart of the state system. \"All children need to have a nurturing, caring school environment,\" she says. To which we all say, amen. </p> <p> \u0095 Alternatives in Education Fair: Saturday, Sept 30, Conway Hall, Red Lion Square, London, for details, call HSE on 01275 332516.</p>",
  "<p>In a recent circular, Eton warns prospective parents to prepare for fees of \u00a360,000 by the year 2020. Many parents find the current fees quite high enough, and opt for less prestigious boarding schools, but even these are unlikely to leave much change out of \u00a315,000 a year once \"extras\" are taken into account. Not surprisingly, independent schools are seeing their boarding numbers drop as families count the cost and opt for day schooling. </p> <p>But thousands of parents still grit their teeth and write the cheque. Some feel they have little choice. A report by the Henley Centre identified the kind of parents who, while never boarders themselves, are considering boarding for their children. These \"Double Income in a Hurry\" families are trying to give their children some degree of constancy in what is often a whirlwind family life. </p> <p>But there is an alternative. Adams in Shropshire is a 350-year-old school with a strong academic record. It was founded by Lord Mayor of London Sir Thomas Adams in 1650. Farmers' sons would arrive on horseback on a Monday and leave on Fridays to return to the plough. Boarding fees at Adams are just over \u00a35,000 per year. A family could send four children to the school for the cost of one place at Eton. Not surprisingly, the boarding house is full and there is a waiting list. The surprise comes with the type of school. Adams is a state school, a comprehensive. </p> <p>\"Most people don't know about us, they've never heard of the system,\" says Gillian Brierley, who manages boarding at the school. \"There's a reaction of, 'Why are you so cheap? Is it because you're second-rate?' To which the answer is no, we are a state school, but the results are excellent.\" </p> <p>There are 36 state boarding schools in England offering 4,000 places. Fees range from \u00a31,450 to \u00a32,200 a term and the schools cover the whole range of state provision, from boys' grammar schools to city comprehensives. The largest is Wymondham in Norfolk with 500 boarders, but the majority, like Adams, have relatively small boarding houses. </p> <p>The local education authority meets tuition costs as they would for any other child at the school. Fees cover accommodation, food and other expenses. In the 1960s there were nearly 200 such schools, but many were allowed to wither away. </p> <p>Today Adams has 54 boarders. Brierley believes the changing employment climate is creating more demand for the kind of settled schooling that boarders benefit from. \"There's an awful lot of movement of parents, especially now that most mothers are working as well. A lot work full-time and send their child here for weekly boarding. People are just much more mobile than they used to be.\" </p> <p>Geoffrey and Kristine are different. They had no option but to send their three daughters to boarding school. The Taylors live on Bryher, the smallest of the Isles of Scilly, where there is no school at all. \"There are a lot of tidal problems even in good weather,\" says Geoff Taylor. \"Sometimes you can't get off the island.\" The family's three girls go to Adams. </p> <p>\"It's only in the last five or six years that people discovered state boarding as an option,\" says Geoff. \"On Scilly, kids aren't streetwise. They needed to have somewhere that offered both a secure environment and an opportunity to experience a degree of freedom, to make the transition.\" The family are certainly not worried about the education their daughters received. The two elder girls did well; Rosamund, currently head girl at Adams, is applying to Oxford this year. \"It's very different from being at home,\" she says. \"But in a good way; I've gained more independence. Boarding is a good half-way step between home and university.\" Relationships with other pupils at the school are good. \"I've got friends from the boarding house and friends from college,\" says Rosamund. Teachers report that boarders get on well with the day pupils, with sleepovers in the boarding house a popular option. </p> <p>Just why state boarding should be the best-kept secret in UK education is a mystery. Wymondham's head, Victoria Musgrave, says that the Department for Education and Employment has to be constantly reminded of the school's existence. A DfEE information booklet does exist but it isn't heavily promoted. </p> <p>Inevitably, given the fees charged, the boarders in these schools tend to be middle-class. Heads in the \"comprehensive\" boarding schools claim a balanced intake, but at least one Midlands head believes that Stourbridge's Old Swinford School cannot justifiably claim to be a comprehensive school. </p> <p>\"It selects by parental income,\" she says. It's noticeable that schools with larger boarding houses like Old Swinford and Wymondham achieve much higher GCSE results than some of the smaller boarding establishments attached to schools with a more comprehensive intake. But Wymondham's Victoria Musgrave argues that the results are down to a school culture that values endeavour. </p> <p>\"They really worked their socks off for those results,\" she says. In the past, some boarding-school places were filled by social services departments that would select young people who needed to live apart from their family. That is now much less common, but many heads would love to be able to offer places regardless of income. Some can offer places funded by charitable foundations, but there is no state funding mechanism to cover boarding costs, even for parents like the Taylors who have little alternative. </p> <p>The last administration's assisted places schemes didn't apply to state school boarding, much to some heads' disgust. And current initiatives, led by millionaire Peter Lampl, offer inner-city children a chance of a quality education in a different environment; but they have also ignored the state boarding sector. </p> <p>\"This is a real alternative to independent schooling,\" says Chris Potter, head at Old Swinford. \"If there were state scholarships, that would be tremendous, we would be inundated.\" </p> <p> \u0095 For information about state boarding schools: <a href=\"http://www.stabis.org.uk\">www.stabis.org.uk</a> For copies of the DfEE booklet, telephone: 020-7925 5555.</p>",
  "<p>The mantra being heard across the City yesterday was speculation, speculation, speculation. </p> <p>\"The market feels good for something, the question is who, what and when,\" said one senior trader. With tip-hungry punters losing interest in last week's takeover favourites - <strong> Bank of Scotland </strong>, off 5p to 605p, and <strong> Royal &amp; Sun Alliance </strong>, down 8.5p to 467.5p - a new list of runners and riders was quickly drawn up. </p> <p>Heading the list was retail conglomerate <strong> Kingfisher </strong>, with <strong> Invensys </strong>, <strong> Emap </strong>, <strong> Thus</strong> and<strong> Geo Interactive Media</strong> also present. </p> <p>Meanwhile, back in the world of facts and figures, the FTSE 100 closed 51.2 points higher at 6,257.1 as investors decided that, following last week's intervention in the currency and oil markets, the global economy is not after all heading for disaster. </p> <p>The Techmark and FTSE 250 also posted strong gains. </p> <p>Some bullish traders are predicting further gains as fund managers (who are awash with cash by historical standards) rush to invest before the close of the third quarter on Friday. </p> <p>There was no doubt about the story of the day. <strong> Kingfisher</strong> ended 47.75p - equivalent to 11.23% - higher at 473p following a strange chain of events involving French retailer Pinault Printemps-Redoute and a US investment bank, said to be Schroder Salomon Smith Barney. </p> <p>After a lively morning of trading, Kingfisher shares had reached 440p by 2pm after 6m units had changed hands. In the next 40 minutes of trading the stock shot up to 470p with turnover reaching a massive total of 22m units. </p> <p>The initial impetus for the move came from the large US investment bank, which had agreed to sell a client 12m Kingfisher shares at 458.5p. Because it did not have enough stock on its book to cover the trade, the bank was forced to buy shares in the market to cover the position. </p> <p>Unfortunately for the bank, the trade coincided with speculation that Kingfisher was about to reveal an all-share merger with Pinault, a strange tale given that the French group has no obvious overlaps with Kingfisher. Nevertheless, the rumours resulted in a scramble for stock. </p> <p>Although Pinault issued a denial of the merger speculation, briefly taking the stock price all the way back to 440p, the determination of the bank to close the position amid fresh speculation (US home improvement group Home De pot was said to be ready with an offer) saw the shares close at 473p. </p> <p>Meanwhile, <strong> Invensys </strong>, the controls and automation group, ended the day as the best performing FTSE 100 stock as rumours of a takeover gathered momentum. </p> <p>There was nothing new in the talk. The usual names were being mentioned from Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the buyout specialist that yesterday bought the non-core oper ations of chemicals group <strong> Laporte </strong>, up 85.25p to 508.75p, to US groups Tyco and GE. There were even suggestions that German firm Siemens or even Swedish group ABB could be interested. </p> <p>Analysts at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson added fuel to the fire when in a note to clients they said Invensys could not continue trading at such a severe discount without one of the aforementioned companies taking a shot. Dresdner reckons Invensys is worth 295p on a sum-of-the-parts valuation. The stock closed at 151.75p, after rising 15.5p over the session, with 43.8m units changing hands. </p> <p>Elsewhere, dealers were begging to chatter excitedly about Emap, up 22p to 972p, the company behind lad magazine FHM. The gossips reckon the company has got a lucrative link-up, which will be enough to keep it on the FTSE 100. Telecoms group Thus picked up 9p to 132p due to talk of an offer. </p> <p>Video compression specialist Geo Interactive advanced 95p to \u00a312, with retail punters excited by a report in the Israeli business press. According to that story, the group is once again close to a deal with Ericsson.</p>",
  "Ken Livingstone yesterday threatened legal action if John Prescott, the deputy prime minister, pressed ahead with his plans to part-privatise the London Underground, after an independent report damned them as offering poor value for money and potentially risking the safety of passengers. <p>London's mayor, who is due to take over the tube only after the private contracts are locked in place, said it would now be unreasonable in law for the government to carry on with its public-private partnership unless there were radical changes to the scheme. </p> <p>His remarks were made as government sources said that conflict between the Treasury and Mr Prescott's Transport and Environment Department over how to finance tube modernisation were hampering attempts to achieve a workable political compromise over the issue. </p> <p>Tony Blair conceded during the London mayoral election that it would be difficult to go ahead with part-privatisation of the tube if Mr Livingstone were elected, but the government now appears determined to force through the scheme. </p> <p>Yesterday's report by Will Hutton, chief executive of the Industrial Society think tank, commissioned at Labour's insistence, argued that the PPP should be abandoned in favour of a bond-financed public sector option, unless tougher safeguards on safety, contract compliance and value for money are introduced. </p> <p>\"I would have thought to proceed now in the light of Will Hutton's complaints, unless they adapt and take on board his points, there is an opening for a judicial review of the decision,\" said Mr Livingstone. </p> <p>\"I am not opposed to partnership with the private sector on principle, but this is a rotten deal which binds London for 30 years to overgenerous contracts giving private sector monopolies intolerable powers over London's democratically-elected authorities\". </p> <p>The Rail Maritime and Transport union's senior tube official, Bob Crow, yesterday raised the prospect of a strike over safety on the London Underground, while Mick Rix, general secretary of the train drivers' union Aslef, said the Hutton report had blown a hole through the government's case for PPP. </p> <p>\"The government must now think again and start listening to the trade unions, the elected London mayor and Londoners who voted for him on a platform of a properly funded, publicly owned future for the tube.\"</p>",
  "<p>Redstone Telecom deftly avoided controversy yesterday when it announced its plans to exploit the breaking of British Telecom's grip on the local telephone network next year. </p> <p>Redstone, which provides services to small and medium size businesses, said it had applied for access to 1,250 BT exchanges. </p> <p>The company has, however, opted to install its equipment outside the exchanges, avoiding BT's complaints about lack of space in its 6,000 exchanges and security issues which have led some rivals to accuse it of muddying the process. </p> <p>\"There is a way round all this,\" said Bob Cushing, Redstone's group marketing and business development director. \"Most companies have applied for physical space within BT exchanges and do not realise how difficult that is. We were not expecting this process to be anything other than complicated.\" </p> <p>Both BT and regulator Oftel have come under intense criticism for their handling of the break-up of the local phone network, known as \"unbundling the local loop\". </p> <p>The issue has become highly charged because it is seen as inextricable from the widespread adoption of broadband services. Competition is expected to accelerate the installation of DSL technology which upgrades the copper wires to high speed internet access and broadcast links. </p> <p>Some companies including US groups WorldCom and Global Crossing have abandoned plans to offer high-speed internet services amid claims that BT was blocking access to the most lucrative exchanges. </p> <p>\"DSL fundamentally changes our business,\" Mr Cushing said. \"We are able to offer services such as high-quality video conferencing which are currently well beyond small companies. For us it builds the margin and relationship with customers.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>Trade deficit reaches record </strong></p> <p> Britain's trade deficit widened from \u00a32.4bn to a record \u00a33bn in July as import growth forged ahead at the fastest pace since the late 1980s boom. </p> <p>Strong domestic demand sucked in imports worth \u00a318.2bn while exports totalled \u00a315.2bn, according to data published yesterday by the office for national statistics. </p> <p>Despite sterling's strength against the euro, Britain recorded a relatively small deficit with the EU of \u00a3300m, up from \u00a3200m in June.

There is a subsidy package waiting for approval by the EC which would offer some help over the next two years that might at maximum give the UK coal industry \u00a3100m in total.

  "<b> Yesterday</b> <br> <p><b> Good day</b><br> </p> <p> Good day undoubtedly for iron chancellor Gordon Brown. He must have been flushed with pride after getting a four-minute standing ovation from delegates. But perhaps schemers among Labour's ranks may have detected another reason for his happiness.

  "<p>An international Swedish construction firm which was one of the leading partners in the controversial project to build the Ilisu dam in eastern Turkey has pulled out of the scheme in order to protect its environmental reputation. </p> <p>The decision by Skanska, which had a 24% stake in the project, is a body blow to the seven-company consortium led by the British firm Balfour Beatty, which has a 31% stake. All of the companies had asked for the export credit guarantee agencies of their countries to fund their part of the work. </p> <p>The project has become the focus of a global campaign by environmental and human rights groups, who claim that up to 25,000 Kurds would see their homes disappear below the dam's reservoir and that it would potentially cut the flow of the river Tigris into Syria and Iraq. </p> <p>Officially, the government has yet to decide whether to continue to back the project with taxpayers' money but Robin Cook, the foreign secretary, and Stephen Byers, the trade and industry secretary, are both against its construction on ethical grounds. </p> <p>The prime minister, Tony Blair, overruled their objec tions and has said that the government \"was minded to back the project\". </p> <p>Yesterday the news that Skanska had pulled out was revealed at the Labour party conference in Brighton in a leak that was intended to embarrass Mr Blair in showing that a company with a worldwide reputation for respecting the environment had pulled out of a project that he still appears to favour. </p> <p>The Department of Trade and Industry would only say yesterday that no decision had been made on the dam and that \"Balfour Beatty has assured us their application for \u00a3200m credit remains live\". </p> <p>Thor Krussel, a spokesman for Skanska, said he was contractually obliged not to speak to the press about the Ilisu dam. However, he pointed to a recent updating of the company's environmental statement by the firm's president and chief executive Claes Bjork, which says: \"Caring about people and the environment must permeate all of our work. </p> <p>\"Skanska will abstain from participating in construction projects when in our judgment a project will result in serious risks to the environment or to society at large.\" </p> <p>Balfour Beatty confirmed that Skanska had pulled out of the consortium but said the decision was down to contractual disagreements and not the environment. </p> <p>Environmental pressure groups, which have been campaigning against the dam, were delighted at the news. Tony Juniper from Friends of the Earth said: \"A company with a good environmental record like Skanska, which wants to retain it, clearly cannot afford to go near a project like Ilisu. </p> <p>\"Balfour Beatty on the other hand with such schemes as the Pergau dam, in Malaysia, and the Cardiff Bay barrage, in Wales, has got nothing to defend and is going ahead.\" </p> <p>Nick Hilyard, from the environmental think tank Corner House, said \"This is excellent news, it will be a big factor in the scheme's demise.\" </p> <p>He added that the Swedish pullout coincided with news from Turkey that the country's existing dam schemes on the Euphrates river in the same region were in serious trouble. </p> <p>The water level was so low because of drought that the dams were virtually unable to produce electricity - although they were supposed to provide one fifth of the nation's supply. Reports said that even with normal rains it will take four to five years for the dams to reach normal capacity.</p>",
  "<p>Clare Short will today cast the protesters besieging the annual meetings of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund in Prague as \"Luddites\" with no constructive alternatives to the institutions they criticise. </p> <p>\"Those who want to stop globalisation are today's Luddites,\" the international development secretary will tell Labour delegates at Brighton. \"We understand their worries, but their call to halt historical change and tear down our international institutions offers no solution. The challenge of globalisation is to share the fruits of the new wealth across the world and usher in an era that eliminates abject poverty.\" </p> <p>In Prague yesterday, the protesters were preparing for today's showdown. Crammed elbow to elbow 200 \"carnivalistas\" splashed paint and glue around, putting finishing touches to papier mch\u00e9 globes and effigies of fat bankers, dribbling banknotes.

There are groups from Italy connected to the zapatistas in Mexico, others calling for the rebirth of communism. </p> <p>What happens today is the first attempt at a European-wide coordinated protests against global institutions,with more than 20 nationalities taking part. \"Make protest as global as capitalism,\" read one of the banners being prepared yesterday. </p> <p>Prague may be the biggest but it is just one of 37 protests around the world against the World Bank/IMF today. Almost all the protesters in the Czech capital see themselves as part of a growing phenomenon which has so far not fully expressed itself or worked out what it wants or where it is going. </p> <p>Looked at closely, however, Prague is many protests by groups who would not normally even talk to each other, and many of whom are bitterly opposed. British anti-capitalists, as represented by the umbrella group Reclaim the Streets which directed the City riots in London, have a deep disrespect for the many socialist groups, whom they accuse of jumping aboard the bandwagon after Seattle. No one will talk to Oxfam, Christian Aid and War on Want who are widely dismissed as \"establishment\". </p> <p>\"The European experience is very confused,\" says Stefan Bienenfeld, a German who works with the Czech coordinating committee and has been observing the arrival of groups from across the continent. \"It is so far incoherent. That's why there are no demands or consensus\". </p> <p>One British activist admitted: \"The British are very isolated. The Germans are starting to work with the Poles and the French with the Spanish and Italians, but there is little debate or understanding.\"</p>",
  "HMS Anon, an unnamed 4,000-tonne destroyer, hurtled past Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty at 32 knots and set course to ram-raid the twin towers of the World Trade Center on Manhattan Island. <p>The fog came down over New York and the captain did a stomach-churning swerve in a rolling 10ft sea to avoid a buoy.

But no bits of metal would have fallen off and we have no collision sound effects. </p> <p>\"The object is to allow mariners to practise their skills in a safe environment. If they run aground here, there is no harm done to the ship - and no pollution.\" </p> <p>Twelve video projectors and computer graphics can create a variety of port land and seascapes, including Felixstowe and the ship-packed English Channel, and changing conditions are used to test the team work of crews. </p> <p>\"In any group, one or two people will treat it as a joke,\" added Mr Kunze. \"But after a couple of minutes, they forget the jokes and really get into it because it feels so much like the real thing. </p> <p>\"Ships loom suddenly out of the fog as in real life and it's interesting to hear the comments of the students. Usually it's an expletive followed by a large helm order.\" </p>"
