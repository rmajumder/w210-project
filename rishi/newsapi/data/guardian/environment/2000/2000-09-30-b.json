  "<p>Long, long ago, in the dark, Tory-governed era known as the early nineties, this reporter made - shock! horror! - a mistake. Flattered by the attentions of a well-known publishing company, waist-deep in debt and desperate to escape the confines of her parental home, she took the first job she was offered. </p> <p>Reader, I hated it. I felt bored, underused and unstimulated. Worse, I realised that my plan - to move across to another part of the company - was unfeasible. I struggled on for ten months, then handed in my notice. A series of equally miserable jobs followed. Trapped in the wrong sector, I finally went freelance and slowly eased my way into the position I had always craved. </p> <p>Regret is futile and I learned a lot along the way, but I often wish that, as a new graduate, I'd waited until a more suitable position came along and saved myself years of frustration. </p> <p>You're probably a lot more clued up than I was - and the job market has become more flexible and graduate-friendly in the last few years - but I don't want you to repeat my mistake. So, before you sign your name on that first job contract, listen up. </p> <p>First, let's get something straight. There's nothing wrong with taking the first job you're offered, as long as it's the \"right\" job. And what with parental pressures (\"We're not supporting you anymore\", \"It's time you found your own place\" etc), the burden of student debts and the desire to join your peers on the career ladder, it's easy to make a first job mistake. There are many: joining a company where you don't fit in; realising the industry bores you; finding out you're trapped (for example, media sales is not a launch-pad into a career as a war correspondent); simply being unrealistic (you might have great ideas to turn round Marks &amp; Spencer's fortunes, but no-one will make you chairman straight out of college). </p> <p>It's obvious, but if you don't apply for the wrong first job, you won't be offered it. The trick, according to Imogen Daniels, adviser to the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, is to do as much pre-application research as possible - and that requires a little navel-gazing. </p> <p>\"Do an MOT on yourself before you start applying and make it a continuous process,\" she suggests. \"Ask yourself why you're attracted by certain jobs, what your motivations are, why you're applying to particular organisations in certain industries? Do you want to earn lots of money? Are you prepared to work long hours at the cost of your social life? Will you really be happy in a large organisation or would you feel more at home in a small, intimate environment?\" </p> <p>Next, says Lawrence Wilson, director of careers and student development at Canterbury, Christchurch, thoroughly research the industry and organisations that attract you. Be realistic - some sectors, particularly creative ones, won't pay the average graduate starting-salary, so waiting for the perfect job with the perfect package may be a waste of time. Read up about your chosen sector and company, in newspapers and on the internet and, if possible, try to speak to people who know what the company culture is like.</p> <p>If you get a job interview, use it as an opportunity to observe the company's working environment, the dress-code and stress-levels. But, Lawrence admits, \"For many people, the only way to decide their suitability for a certain job or area is to do it. If you discover you've made a mistake, unless it's so bad that it's making you ill or destroying your confidence, you should give it at least six months so it looks credible on your CV. You won't be trapped in your first job for life - the 40 hours a week, 40 years with the company ethos has long gone - and downsizing has changed the concept of commitment and loyalty within society.\" </p> <p>So, should you take the first job you're offered? \"In general, it's better to be in employment than unemployed - not just from a financial point of view but from a psychological one,\" says Lawrence. </p> <p>\"Working gives you confidence and structure. You should avoid the shock of the dole queue at all costs. If you really can't find the job you want - or have no idea what you want to do - temp for a while, or even do voluntary work.\" </p> <p>One day, perhaps, they'll invent sophisticated computers which can take your genetic code and match it to the industry, company, role and workmates that are best suited to you. </p> <p>Until then, mistakes will continue to be made. But remember, even if you hate your new job with a passion, you'll learn a lot about yourself and the world of work... even if it's merely discovering what you don't want to do.</p>",
  "<p>Competition in the credit card market hotted up further this week with newcomer Thomas Cook cutting its rate for balance transfers to one of the lowest on the market, and American Express adding benefits to its green charge card. </p> <p>Travel agent Thomas Cook has signed up more than 10,000 customers since launching its own-brand card in April, and hopes to recruit many more by reducing its introductory annual percentage rate (APR) on balance transfers from 3.9 to 2.9, shaving its rate for purchases from 16.9 to 15.9, and adding a cashback facility for people who use the card to buy their holiday at Thomas Cook. </p> <p>The special offer balance transfer rate lasts for six months - after that it reverts to 15.9 APR. The cashback scheme will give those who book their holiday at the travel agent money back at the rate of 0.5% for up to \u00a32,000 spent and 1% back for \u00a32,000-plus, though this is taken straight off their credit card bill. The card already has a loyalty scheme where customers earn between 0.5% and 2% back in the form of Thomas Cook \"travel pounds,\" which can be redeemed against travel purchases made in its branches. </p> <p>This week also saw American Express sign a deal with online retailer <a href=\"http://www.lastminute.com\">Lastminute.com</a> to offer \"exclusive\" late deals and special offers to its army of green charge card holders. The link-up is part of a multi-million pound revamp of the card. The deals and offers will range from \"experiences\", such as learning to race a power boat or taking a tiger moth flight, to book ing holidays and concert tickets. Card-holders can find out more by logging on to the new Amex website: <br><a href=\"http://www.americanexpress.co.uk/green\">www.americanexpress.co.uk/green</a> </p> <p>The two announcements came hot on the heels of the launch of a new credit card from Capital One with an APR for purchases of zero for the first six months. After that it reverts to 12.9 APR. And for cardholders transferring balances in the first six months, Capital One is offering a lifetime rate of 7.9 APR on the amount transferred. </p> <p>However, research from the company illustrates the challenge it and other newcomers face in persuading the public to ditch their less competitive plastic and sign up for their cards. Its survey found that only one in 10 of us are happy with our current card - but 58% of people would still think twice about changing to a card with a lower rate. When asked why, the most common reason given was that they \"couldn't be bothered,\" says Capital One, which has calculated that inertia is costing UK cardholders billions of pounds. </p> <p>Capital One's offer was slightly overshadowed by a row over the way it, and many other companies, calculate interest. It's common practice in the UK that if an individual has chunks of debt on their card coming from both balance transfers and purchases, what tends to happen is that the interest accumulated on purchases gets paid off after the interest on balance transfers. This effectively means that the more expensive debt is paid last and the cheaper debt is paid first, which clearly isn't beneficial to consumers. Capital One says it is not alone in operating such a system and adds that it has started a review of its charging regime which could result in changes being made. </p> <p>This week also saw Abbey National's internet bank, Cahoot, rated number one in a survey of internet credit cards. Gomez, a company which rates online offerings, said that out of the nine internet credit card issuers it looked at, Cahoot topped its league table, followed by Egg and Smile, the Co-op Bank's online bank. A spokesman for Gomez says its league tables \"will ensure that consumers make informed decisions before signing up with an internet credit card service\".

  "<p>If the Labour government thinks life is tough now, it should think again. Economically, things can only get weaker. Voters' perceptions of economic wellbeing are shaped by three cycles: employment, interest rates, and house prices. In each case levels and perceived trends are both significant. </p> <p>Rarely do all three combine to create electoral nirvana for an incumbent government. Interest rates tend to run counter to the labour market and housing. The government has already enjoyed the most propitious conjuncture of this term of office. </p> <p>The decline in the euro is arresting UK economic growth and will continue to do so. The oil price shockette will undoubtedly impact on the pace of expansion. Economists are already arguing about the combined effect of this double whammy. </p> <p>The worst effect of high oil prices will probably not be seen for 12 months or so. Corporate profits are suffering the impact of higher raw material prices now. Only when this has fed through to lower investment and hiring plans will the full extent of the damage be known. </p> <p>The euro might be past its worst - relative to the pound - but even rapid recovery would be unlikely to repair the damage to corporate prospects. Decisions to cut back investment are unlikely to be reversed in a hurry - the Japanese may be gone for a generation. </p> <p>The Treasury's problem is that the instruments at its disposal to counter these headwinds are very blunt. Fiscal policy - taxation and government spending - takes a year or more to feed through the economic system. </p> <p>Monetary policy, most obviously in the form of short term interest rates, has been ceded to the Bank of England's monetary policy committee. Even if the MPC could be assumed to act in a manner consistent with the electoral needs of the government, rates take 18 months or so to have their full impact. </p> <p>The International Monetary Fund's latest world economic outlook forecasts a modest decline in UK growth to 2.8% next year. It also expects a modest pick-up in unemployment from the present low level. </p> <p>The IMF is a notoriously consensual forecaster. It is also open to the accusation of driving by the rear-view mirror and this is evident in its assumption that the key risk to world growth is a US economy that first overheats before slowing sharply in response to corrective policy action. </p> <p>The real threat to global activity must now be that confidence ebbs away from the economy, a collective insecurity weighing on the shoulders of consumers and industrialists. This would be exacerbated were policymakers focused on inflationary risk from oil prices rather than their effect on activity levels. </p> <p>Economists are poor at forecasting big swings in growth rates, tending to predict incremental shifts from current trends. The majority could therefore be in for a shock. A gloomy prognosis for the UK economy might be for growth to average nearer 1% next year, and to slow to next to nothing at some point during the course of the year. This would not technically constitute a recession but could feel like one. </p> <p>The warning signals are there. Profit growth from quoted companies - to my mind one of the best indicators of turning points in economic cycles - is disappointing. The disappointments are spread across the new and old economy, not concentrated in the manufacturing sectors which would be expected to bear the brunt of a strong pound and expensive oil. Closer to home for most voters, house prices have come off the boil. In the south-east, data will come to show that they are now falling. There will undoubtedly be a ripple effect outwards. </p> <p>If there is any good news for the chancellor, it is that lags in the system might mask the extent of the slowdown for some months. He must implement a \"feel-not-too-bad\" policy and hope that it outweighs the negativity flowing through the real economy. Such a policy could take either of two forms - tighten the purse strings and hope the MPC cuts interest rates, or loosen the strings and lobby the committee to keep rates on hold. </p> <p>Were an election not in the offing, the former would be more sensible. It would leave the chancellor with maximum flexibility to counter the slowdown if it proves severe. The loose strings approach potentially carries more political points. </p> <p>At present the credibility of the government as an economic manager is not in question. Recent brickbats relate to micro-policy and style of governance. This could all change, and fast. Slowing growth and rising raw material prices constitute a potentially devastating combination. </p> <p>Labour, no doubt, hopes to go into an election trumpeting its success in promoting growth. It risks being charged with underestimating the threats to growth and failing to sustain activity. </p> <p>Hunkered in the bunker at No 10, the government's advisers cling to the belief that the electorate will find William Hague an unthinkable alternative. They may just find that the Tories' economic sins of the 1990s are forgotten in favour of a rose-tinted view of their successes of the 1980s.

  "Britain's Europhiles could be forgiven for crying into their Carlsberg after the Danish referendum. Overnight, the Eurosceptics have transformed this small corner of Scandinavia into a matchbox version of Blighty and presented their campaign as a dry-run of our referendum. The Danish \"Nej\" is meant to be the end of our debate. But history may see it as the moment when the pro-Europeans finally came out fighting. <p>The reflex action of the yes camp has been to stress the differences between Britain and Denmark. The pint-size krone is indeed a less attractive target for speculators than an international currency like the pound. And as the krone was already pegged to the euro, it was difficult to persuade voters that the euro would bring any new economic benefits. </p> <p>Denmark also has fewer floating voters. Public opinion has been hardened by six referendums on European questions in the past 20 years. This wearying succession of public debates has left few undecided. In Britain, there is still everything to fight for. Opinion polls show that almost half the country say they are \"open to persuasion\" on the euro. </p> <p>The issues in Copenhagen were completely different. Many older voters feared that Denmark's generous welfare state would be jeopardised by hard-nosed monetarists in the European Central Bank - not a common complaint here. And fears over Denmark's power within the EU are similarly alien. The imposition of EU sanctions on Austria led to real public concern that small countries would be left powerless. Defeat in Denmark can teach pro-Europeans three important lessons. </p> <p>First it shows that Blair must win the political - as well as the economic - argument on the euro. The Danish yes campaign showed beyond doubt that even the people convinced of the benefits for jobs and mortgages will still vote no if we lose the argument on sovereignty. The yes campaign should therefore argue that pooling sovereignty in the EU is the best way to maintain our influence over our everyday lives on economics, the environment and security. And outside the euro we will never punch our weight. This argument is already partly won. A majority of British public opinion is in favour of European action in the areas where they think it makes sense - on pollution and defence. </p> <p>Making the political case for the euro will depend on getting the big picture right. The Danish yes campaign was defeated on the details. It often ended up on a defensive footing - frantically rebutting scare stories about pensions and tax harmonisation, because it failed to set out a practical, attractive vision of the EU. The prime minister needs to set out an EU blueprint to rival the federal super-state of popular imagination. </p> <p>Timing is half the battle. The Danish campaign coincided with all-time lows in the value of the euro against the dollar and was called during a severe bout of mid-term blues. Tony Blair would be wise to keep his flexible formula on the timing of the referendum (\"early in the next parliament\") if he is to avoid temporary storms blowing him off course. </p> <p>There is often a temptation to preach to the converted. Of course it's true that the public will listen to expert voices on economics and that views will filter down from the boardroom. But the yes campaign in Denmark spent a disproportionate amount of time and resources wooing the sharp suits that were already onboard. The next phase of the euro campaign in Britain has to take the battle from the business pages and CBI receptions to glossy magazines and kitchen tables. </p> <p>The testosterone-fuelled political classes should not lose sight of the fact that the euro campaign will have to be targeted at women. A gaping gender gap proved fatal to the yes camp in Denmark, who couldn't find a language and style to appeal to women voters. In Britain, according to a recent Mori poll, only 27% of women would vote in favour of a single currency compared to 35% of men. </p> <p>The final lesson is the most important. Whatever the political strategy, Denmark has shown how the referendum will be won or lost by that most elusive of political commodities: public trust. This will be more important than the detail of economic argument and will have to come from politicians, not business leaders. </p> <p> Though Danish business opinion was overwhelmingly in favour, the scepticism of a handful of high-profile bankers gave the impression that opinion was divided. As Bob Worcester convincingly argues in the Foreign Policy Centre pamphlet, How To Win The Euro Referendum, when expert opinion is split on complex issues, the electorate will respond to politicians they trust. </p> <p>According to this law, Danish prime minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen was doomed from the start. Ever since he failed to implement the \"efterlon\", a manifesto pledge to lower the age of retirement, he lost public confidence. Only 8% of the electorate express \"a lot of trust\" in him. Even in the middle of the fuel crisis, Tony Blair scored much higher. </p> <p>Preserving this trust means being obsessive about the credibility of your arguments. Don't make claims for Europe that don't stack up. Under the Tories, it was true that the EU offered people social protection that the government denied them. But everyone knows that they can get social benefits from a Labour government with or without EU support. This means focusing only on areas where Europe can add value: the single market, cheaper prices, environmental action, defence and the battle against organised crime. And it means being honest about the facts. The Danish yes camp was not believed when it made dark predictions of economic doom. British pro-Europeans should not flinch from pointing out the dangers of staying out of the euro zone, but they should steer clear of apocalyptic rhetoric. </p> <p>Pulling off the greatest turnaround in public opinion since the war will be no easy task. The leader of the yes campaign in Britain will need to find a new political vocabulary, capable of reaching the parts that other politicians can't. And they'll need to do it at a time when faith in the political system has never been lower. But pro-Europeans should relish the challenge. We have all the arguments on our side. All we need to do is find effective proselytisers for our cause. To vulgarise a phrase from that fabled communicator in the Whitehouse: \"It's the politics, stupid.\" </p> <p> Mark Leonard is director of the Foreign Policy Centre.

  "<p>Neo-Nazi extremism is a worrying phenomenon. It is, of course, not confined to Germany. It exists in different strengths in numerous European countries as well as the US. We certainly have no grounds for smugness about it in this country. The radical right's nihilistic violence and intolerance make life a misery for ethnic minorities and others exposed to a climate of fear on a daily basis. </p> <p>In Germany, the problem is particularly pronounced in the eastern provinces which, until 1990, formed part of the German Democratic Republic and still suffer from relative economic deprivation. Though serious incidents of neo-Nazi terror have frequently taken place in cities such as Rostock, on the Baltic coast, conditions for foreigners - especially from eastern Europe or non-European countries - are in some ways even worse outside the big cities where, as was the case with Jews in Nazi Germany, they represent particularly exposed targets. </p> <p>The neo-Nazi organisations have no coherent ideology to speak of. Like the Nazis of the 1920s, their worldview is made up of a crude amalgam of phobias and resentments fixed, inevitably, on the vicious search for scapegoats. Unlike the original Nazis, however, they have no possibility of latching on to important strands of an existing political culture. </p> <p>In the 20s, the aim of building an ethnically pure \"national community\" which would eradicate social divisions and bring power and prosperity was beguiling for more than just hardline Nazi supporters. And it was a vision which Hitler offered to a country wracked by the deepest of fissures, running through state and society, underpinned by a profound sense of national humiliation after the loss of the first world war and the imposition of the Treaty of Versailles. </p> <p>This fertile ground is simply not present today. Neo-Nazi imagery is backward-looking, finding an ideological lowest common denominator in a glorified but completely distorted image of Hitler and the Third Reich. They need a hero - someone who represented a macho-Germany, the power, might and national grandeur which is lacking in their often dismal, unappealing and powerless everyday reality of the present. </p> <p>It is evidently asking too much of latter-day Hitler admirers to see that the \"good times\" of the 1930s led inexorably to the disasters of the 1940s, and that their hero bears the chief personal responsibility for the catastrophe. But most Germans today recognise this plainly. </p> <p>However appalling the actions of the neo-Nazis are, short of the onset of a mega-political and social crisis such as only a war - or perhaps a total collapse of the world-economic system - could bring, they pose no threat to the existing state systems, in Germany or elsewhere. Without such preconditions, they will remain an intense social pest, but one confined to the lunatic fringes of society and politics, not a threat to their substance. </p> <p>In the 20s, the fragile democracy of the Weimar Republic was increasingly devoid of support, both from the masses and from the powerful elites in business, agriculture, the civil service and - not least - the army, biding their time until they could bring back an authoritarian system of rule. </p> <p>As the Depression paralysed the economy in the early 1930s, democracy was as good as friendless. In contrast to Britain, where there were certainly economic, and for a time governmental, difficulties, Germany suffered from a total, comprehensive crisis of the state system itself. Where the structures of the British parliamentary system held firm, depriving Oswald Mosley and the British Union of Fascists of the \"political space\" in which they might have gained support, in Germany the terminal collapse of pluralist, democratic structures left the door gaping wide open for Hitler's takeover of power. </p> <p>Today, Germany is a modern, well-functioning, consolidated parliamentary democracy enjoying overwhelming backing from the vast majority of the population. The pockets of neo-Nazi support would, in the event of elections tomorrow, almost certainly fail to be converted into a single seat in the Bundestag. Far from being tormented by economic crisis, today's Germany is among the wealthiest countries in the world. </p> <p>Its problems are for the most part those shared with other modern capitalist economies. The incorporation of the former GDR has been, and still is a specific problem - there is still a good way to go before the economic and social disparities with the wealthier western parts of the country are ironed out. And the pyschological scars from the perceived disadvantaging of the east will no doubt take still longer to heal. But unless there is unforeseen calamity, Germany's economic prosperity ought to see the problems diminish greatly over the next generation. The residual illusory hopes invested in a new F\u00fchrer will probably then evaporate, as they did following a short-lived upsurge of the radical right in the 60s - apart, doubtless, from an unreconstructed 2-4% of the population (as in other countries). </p> <p>Meanwhile, intensified controls on neo-Nazi activity, more education aimed at heading off recruitment, and, not least, more channelled funding to give disillusioned and sometimes despairing youth in the eastern regions hope for the future and a greater stake in today's democracy, ought to help. </p> <p>There is one further barrier to the radical right. The European Union, for all its faults, provides a level of political co-operation which, coupled with the imperatives of a global economy, offers a strong bulwark against the type of political and economic storm- waves of the 20s and early 30s. </p> <p>Imagine the neo-Nazi problem in a Germany decoupled from the EU (and especially, from its pivotal relationship with France), in a Europe with serious national and economic tensions and conflicts, and reflect whether European integration has been a positive or negative development. </p> <p>Of course, the EU has itself been a source of the resentment that has flowed into the new nationalisms, not least with J\u00f6rg Haider in Austria. Politicians recognise, behind the rhetoric around immigration, objective problems of freedom of population in the post-cold-war Europe have to be tackled. And Haider and his like have succeeded in influencing the agenda of conservative parties. </p> <p>But democratic structures have not been threatened. And were they to be so, then more rigorous and concerted international action than the ill-conceived boycott against Austria would provide serious obstacles to any individual country within the EU wanting to go its own way. In any case, though Haider might be a nasty piece of work, he is no Hitler. </p> <p>So western European democratic structures, and specifically those of Germany, are alive and well and highly unlikely to succumb to the neo-Nazi right. A new Hitler in Germany or the rest of western Europe, short of unforeseen catastrophe, will not arise. Further east, in Russia, where we can only keep our fingers crossed about future developments, a lingering question-mark remains. </p> <p>Ian Kershaw's Hitler 1936-1945: Nemesis is published on October 9 by Penguin, Price \u00a325.<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,501025482,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p>",

In an over-determined narrative we learn how the hedonistic, now-forgotten writer Norman Douglas teaches Elizabeth David to crack eggs, sip wine and bring a taste of the Mediterranean to Britain. \"Uncle Norman\" introduces Eric, an Edwardian Camden kid, to culture and sex, and bumps into David on the wartime Cte D'Azur. Through Cherry, a Camden caterer, and husband John, the story comes to a disappointing full circle.

It is 1973, the boys are back, Nixon is up in front of the people and out in the suburbs there is a house-warming. The vets drink and pop pills to keep the demons away, while the women gather in the bedroom pretending everything is back where it left off before call-up. Twenty years on, the men are dying, gone mad or gone AWOL. The war even dogs the children. Gologorsky's novel reads like a play script.

You can read it as an insider's guide to Caucasian culture, as a portrait of the ethnic and religious fault-line between Christianity and Islam (European Russia and Azerbaijan), or as a 20th-century Romeo and Juliet in which the first world war and revolution threaten to tear Azerbaijani Muslim Ali away from Georgian Christian Nino. Then there is the mystery of its author's identity, and how a German exile found a second-hand copy of the original German text and translated it into English. Ali and Nino is a beautiful, cultish book, a love story and a spirited defence of a culture alien to the West. </p> <p> <strong> A Beleaguered City</strong><br> Margaret Oliphant <br> Canongate, \u00a37.99<br> <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,501070492,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a> <br> </p> <p> The eight stories collected here are solid examples of the sort of writing that filled the monthly magazines of Victorian Britain. Oliphant was a prodigious writer, and her secret chambers, mysterious windows and family skeletons (in closets, naturally) reflect a 19th-century obsession with death and dark corners.The short novel of the title is a morality play that pits the worldly men of a French town against the more intuitive womenfolk when the dead rise from their graves; \"The Library Window\" excellently conveys a child's terror of her aunt's elderly friends. Fine stuff for fireside reading, though Oliphant is only B-list Gothic. </p>",
  "Richard Nixon was the last candidate not to take a presidential debate seriously. That was in 1960, the first ever televised contest, in which he faced a little-known senator from Massachusetts. No one has ever made the same mistake again. <p>John F Kennedy came to the debate looking tanned and healthy, having prepared for the event on the rooftop of his hotel. Vice-president Nixon had shrugged off advice to spend a few hours under a sun lamp and his naturally pallid complexion highlighted what seemed like a perpetual five o'clock shadow. </p> <p>As he arrived at the Chicago studio, Mr Nixon knocked an already infected knee against the car door. The pain drained the blood from his face and he began to sweat profusely but he waved away offers of make-up. When the debate went live across the nation, the visual contrast was startling. A vigorous and handsome challenger against a nervous and sweating office-holder. It arguably swung the closest US election of the 20th century. </p> <p>Forty years on, almost to the day, the nation is facing another presidential race which is too close to call. The campaigns are focusing on little more than 1m floating voters in a handful of swing states, where many people say they are waiting for this year's three debates between the vice-president, Al Gore, and governor George W Bush to make up their minds. </p> <p><b> Defining moment</b><br> </p> <p> There is, of course, nothing in the US constitution stipulating presidential debates, but it has become the defining moment of the campaign, when the two (or occasionally three) contenders face each other in direct combat. </p> <p>After his disaster in 1960, Mr Nixon refused to debate with anyone again, and the next televised head-to-head was not until 1976. Since then they have become unavoidable, as Mr Bush discovered when his attempt to renegotiate the debates, shifting the encounters to chat shows, made him look nervous and evasive. </p> <p>Ted Sorensen, a key Kennedy aide who later helped to coach Jimmy Carter and Mike Dukakis for their presidential debates, believes they have become an essential part of the democratic process. </p> <p>\"You can memorise arguments, but it is understanding issues which is necessary to avoid stumbles. And it can't be bad having the next president be forced to understand all the issues,\" Mr Sorensen said in an interview this week. </p> <p>The importance of debates is reflected in the enormous lengths the opposing camps go to in grooming their candidates for the event. Preparations start months in advance. This weekend, in the run-up to the first debate in Boston on Tuesday, both candidates will leave the campaign trail for dress rehearsals as meticulously prepared as anything on Broadway. </p> <p>Each nominee has publicly played down the extent of his preparations, but their studied insouciance is all part of the ritual manoeuvring. Governor Bush has been practising since May. </p> <p>This weekend he will hold a mock debate at his ranch in Crawford, Texas, where the family gym has been converted into a television studio, complete with lecterns, lights, cameras and a mock Al Gore, who will be played by a New Hampshire senator, Judd Gregg. It is a role he has perfected since performing as the slightly stiff and earnest vice-president in 1996, when he was advising the Republican nominee for the job, Jack Kemp. </p> <p>However, Mr Bush's preparations look slapdash compared to the lengths the vice-president is going to. Mr Gore is the supreme master of detail. He likes to ensure that the practice room is set at the precise temperature expected in the television studio, even allowing for the warming effect of the bodies of the audience. </p> <p>In his dress rehearsal, his opponent was to have been played by Tom Downey, a friend and former congressman who had been taking professional acting classes for the role. He had reportedly perfected Mr Bush's mannerisms and even his malapropisms. But this month Mr Downey received a package in the post containing a video of Mr Bush rehearsing for the debate together with a batch of briefing notes. An FBI investigation has been launched. Meanwhile, the Gore campaign, anxious not to be seen taking advantage of the leaks, disqualified a disappointed Mr Downey from the rehearsal. His place has been taken by Paul Begala, a former Clinton aide who shares Mr Bush's Texas accent and has just written a book about Bush's record as governor. </p> <p>Mr Gore has gone even further. When he retreats this weekend to his debate boot camp in a Florida marine laboratory, he will take with him not just the usual entourage of advisers, technicians and supporters, but also 13 specially selected \"regular folks\" from a cross-section of the population in swing states. They include a 76-year-old pensioner, a 14-year-old schoolgirl (chaperoned by her mother) an Hispanic construction worker and a black headmaster. <br> <b>Wit, wisdom and a five o' clock shadow</b><br></p> <p><b> 1960 Nixon vs Kennedy </b></p> <p>John Kennedy: \"We cannot turn the job over to anyone else. If the United States fails, then the whole cause of freedom fails, and I think it depends in great measure on what we do here in this country.\" Kennedy looked tanned and relaxed. Nixon was sick and sweating and his complexion made him look unshaved. Afterwards nobody could remember what was said. Only the way they looked. </p> <p><b> 1976 Ford vs Carter </b></p> <p>Gerald Ford: \"There is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe and never will be under a Ford administration.\" This was at the height of the cold war. </p> <p><b> 1976 VP debate: Mondale vs Dole </b></p> <p>Bob Dole: \"If we added up the killed and wounded in Democrat wars in this century it would be about 1.6m Americans. Enough to fill this city of Detroit.\" Dole's credibility suffered from the suggestion that the two world wars had been political. </p> <p><b> 1980 Reagan vs Carter </b></p> <p>Ronald Reagan: \"There you go again.\" This became Reagan's catchphrase and it blunted Carter's fact-laden attacks. </p> <p><b> 1984 Reagan vs Mondale </b> </p> <p>Ronald Reagan: \"I will not make age an issue in this campaign. I am not going to exploit for political purposes my opponent's youth and inexperience.\" This line helped defuse questions about the president's advanced age, and strengthened his high likeability ratings. </p> <p><b> 1988 Bush vs Dukakis </b></p> <p>George Bush: \"Wouldn't it be nice to be the ice-man, and never make a mistake.\" This rescued the vice-president from his verbal blunders and deepened his image of Mike Dukakis as passionless. </p> <p><b> 1988 VP debate: Quayle vs Bentsen </b></p> <p>Lloyd Bentsen: \"Senator, I served with Jack Kennedy. I knew Jack Kennedy. Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy.\" </p> <p><b> 1992 Bush vs Clinton</b> </p> <p>President Bush twice looked at his watch, making him look contemptuous of the proceedings and ill at ease. </p> <p><b> 1996 Clinton vs Dole </b></p> <p>Bill Clinton: \"I can tell you I don't think Senator Dole is too old to be president. It's the age of his ideas that I question.\" With this line, Clinton could appear gallant and issue-oriented and still portray his opponent as out-of-touch. </p> <p><b> 1996 VP debate: Gore vs Kemp </b></p> <p>Al Gore: \"I'd like to start by offering you a deal, Jack. If you won't use any football stories, I will not tell any of my warm and humorous stories about chloro-fluorocarbon abatement.\" The vice-president was able to make self-deprecating fun of his reputation for being wooden, while neutralising his opponent's strongest card - his past as an American football hero.</p>",
  "From the prosperous high streets to the dreary council estates and comfortable suburbs edging into the garden of England two words are repeated endlessly: trust and confidence. They are losing both in Tony Blair. <p>Pensioners, low-paid workers, housewives, businesspeople - Labour loyalists, wavering Tories, floating voters - have heard his commitment to listen, to \"get the message\". They know his speech in Brighton was labelled inspiring, electrifying, his best ever; that delegates left the conference with a spring in their step. </p> <p>Yet in Kent, a corner of marginal middle-Britain, evenly split between Tory and Labour MPs, the people who helped to put Mr Blair into Downing Street appear restless, embittered and often isolated. For the moment, no mainstream party, least of all the Tories under William Hague, appears attractive. </p> <p>The mood in England's most populous county - true blue until 1997 - should set a few alarm bells ringing in New Labour's electoral machine - particularly after a council byelection where voters registered their protest by staying at home and letting the Tories in. </p> <p>For young and old the gulf between government and the people, between platform rhetoric and political reality, is wide. \"I voted for Tony Blair, and was very enthusiastic about a new government,\" says Natalie, a young catering entrepreneur in Gillingham (Labour majority 1,980). \"Now he's wrecked my confidence and the trust people had in him has gone.\" </p> <p>Outside her cafe, Philip Turnbull, 78, shakes his head wearily while walking his dog. \"I am Labour, but no more, after what he did to us,\" he says. </p> <p><b> Discontent</b><br> </p> <p> Ministers should take note. Few seem impressed by a platform commitment from the chancellor and prime minister to respond to the pensioners' revolt with more cash. \"I shall not vote Labour again,\" says Mr Turnbull, who fought in the second world war. \"A lot of pensioners are thinking the same. He promised a lot, but this 75p [this year's pension increase] will barely buy a loaf of bread. I can't afford to visit my grandchildren in the south-west because petrol is so expensive.\" </p> <p>Running for a bus Frances Ebery, another pensioner, underlines the discontent of old Labour loyalists. \"He has disappointed his own people by doing what he did and he will have to fight a lot harder to win them back.\" </p> <p>A few miles away in Maidstone, drinkers in a large pub are watching the closing scenes of the Labour conference on television. Roy, 68, is not impressed. A lifelong Labour voter, he says he has been forced back to work as a part-time lorry driver to make ends meet. \"It's terrible when you've got to do that at my age. We are worse off now than ever.\" He recounts the tale of a friend with a heart complaint who had difficulty getting treatment in the local hospital because of a bed shortage. \"They kept him in for three days and he had to go home. Terrible, isn't it?\" </p> <p>Two weeks ago Ivor Jones, a former mayor of Dartford and a Labour town and district councillor since 1955, was fighting his party's corner extremely hard in a county council byelection at Swanscombe and Stone. No one can recall the seat being anything other than Labour. Yet the Tories won on a 15% turnout, leaving Mr Jones, a retired headmaster, badly bruised and \"terribly, terribly sad\". \"It couldn't have happened at a worse time,\" he says. \"Everyone was whingeing about everything. People are beginning to distrust all politicians.\" </p> <p>So have things improved for Labour over the past week? \"I wish I could say that they have,\" says Mr Jones. \"I have a great admiration for Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. They are very sincere but we have to get our act together nationally.\" On the back of the fuel crisis a whole string of grievances have come to the surface, from pensioner poverty to the millions wasted on the Millennium Dome. </p> <p>Bob Peters, a former lorry driver who now runs a secondhand bookshop in Rochester High Street, strikes a popular chord when he says: \"People are beginning to see through Tony Blair's toothy smile. They have lost trust in him.\" One of his customers is the Labour MP for Medway, Bob Marshall-Andrews (majority 5,354), one of the government's more outspoken backbench critics. Stephen Hubbard, the MP's researcher and a local councillor, highlights the political dilemma facing Mr Blair. On the one hand, the local economy is much stronger than when Labour came to power. On the other, there is a perception that politicians - local and national - \"no longer address people's problems\". </p> <p>In 1997 Labour gained eight seats in Kent, leaving the Tories with nine MPs. \"We were going to have to fight hard to retain these seats and now we'll have to fight even harder,\" says Mr Hubbard. </p> <p>Part of Labour's problem is that some people thought they were voting for big boosts in education and health in 1997. In reality, they had to wait until this year for anything to be announced and will have to wait considerably longer before seeing much difference in the services offered. This leads to the constant cry that \"things haven't changed since the Tories\". </p> <p><b> Expectations</b><br> </p> <p> Paul Clark, the Gillingham MP who overturned a 16,700 Tory majority on a 16% swing, is quick to stress that the government is already delivering a better health service and much improved schooling. \"People had a preconceived idea about what we would be like,\" he says. \"Their expectations were high and they were waiting for us to turn things around very quickly. You have to balance that with what was realistically possible.\" </p> <p>In the museum shop she runs in Rochester, Tara Keating says she has lost faith in almost everyone. As a lone parent and a Tory voter, she is grateful for help from Labour's new deal and the working families tax credit scheme. \"I was more than half way round to backing Tony Blair.\" Then the fuel crisis came. \"They behaved arrogantly in the extreme and I've gone off them.\" Will she vote Tory instead? \"No, Hague is personality zero - he puts off Tory voters.\" Ms Keating says she is now considering voting Green because there is nowhere else to go.</p>",
  "Thirty-thousand feet up and three hours from Moscow, the no-smoking lights went off and the stampede began. A late booking had left me no option but to settle for a smoking perch at the back of the Aeroflot 350-seater. A smoker myself, I had no objection. But then came the invasion of the child-smokers. <p>Two groups of wealthy Muscovite teenagers, on their way home from a school trip to London, were on board. They swarmed to the back by the dozen, chucking packets of Marlboro across the rows. The seat beside me was vacant - momentarily. Three youths piled into it simultaneously, puffing away in my face. </p> <p>The obligatory bossy babushka on board went ballistic. \"Young woman, young woman, you shouldn't be smoking. You're too young.\" True, the girl looked about 10. The OAP was greeted with a sneer. The flight assistants were summoned to sort out the melee. They shrugged and walked away. </p> <p>It's not to everyone's liking, but to my mind, being able to have a fag on a four-hour flight is one of Aeroflot's redeeming features. The airline clearly agrees and is resolved to defend the freedom to light up more or less on demand. </p> <p>In a country where civil liberties seem to come and go on the whim of whoever is occupying the Kremlin, the Russian can depend on a few inalienable rights - vodka and tobacco are the fixtures. They are also, of course, the big killers. </p> <p>More than one in three of the population - children included - smoke. The rich pickings from this colossal market is a boon for the global tobacco giants in disrepute in the west. But if one kind of American is keen to see Marlboro Man thrive in Russia, another kind - health-obsessed and politically correct - is Aeroflot's problem. More specifically, I am referring to Bill Clinton. </p> <p>Last April the US president banned smoking on flights leaving from or arriving in America. But according to the thunderings of Aeroflot this week, this ban is a breach of international law and the principle of national sovereignty. </p> <p>\"We are capable of deciding ourselves whether or not our passengers are allowed to smoke on flights,\" said Aeroflot's top lawyer, Boris Yeliseyev. \"This is also an intrusion into the economic activities of foreign companies outside the US.\" </p> <p>Aeroflot said it was appealing to the International Air Transport Association to put the White House back in its box and have the ban lifted. </p> <p>But if the Americans are keeping Russians from smoking, the reverse, it seems, is also true - American Big Tobacco is killing Russians. No less a figure than Vladimir Kozhin, a close aide to non-smoking President Vladimir Putin, has just filed a suit in the same Florida court that recently ordered the tobacco companies to shell out $145bn (\u00a3100bn) in damages to US smokers. </p> <p>What's good for the Yankee goose is just as good for the Russian gander. \"Russia's expenses amount to millions if not billions of dollars,\" the Kremlin claim stated. </p> <p>The smoke-filled vodka-soaked room is the standard setting for political deals in Moscow. But maybe that's changing under the beady, abstemious eye of Mr Putin. </p> <p>Taking their cue, perhaps, from the asceticism of the new boss - a far cry from the bibulous heyday of Boris Yeltsin - the duma, or lower house, recently voted by a huge majority to ban smoking in the chamber. </p> <p>It seemed an utterly uncharacteristic nod to clean living. But then, Alexei Mitrofanov, one of the clownish extremists who adorn the duma, explained that the vote was directed not at the Russians, but at the wicked Americans. </p> <p>\"It's part of a larger campaign against the western tobacco monopolies that control the Russian market,\" he reasoned.</p>",

  "<p>Pernod Ricard yesterday confirmed that it is in preliminary talks over the sale of its Orangina soft drinks business to Cadbury Schweppes. </p> <p>Though no price has yet been set, the deal is expected to raise around FF5bn (\u00a3476m) - the amount offered by Coca-Cola last year before the acquisition was blocked by the French government. </p> <p>If the Orangina sale goes ahead, it will be the latest in a series of deals within the global beverages industry. Cadbury has already agreed to buy the Snapple soft drinks business in the US, while Pernod has teamed up with Diageo to buy the wines and spirits arm of Seagram. </p> <p>A spokesman for Pernod Ricard in Paris said: \"We are having talks with [Cadbury Schweppes] but we have a confidentiality agreement, so we cannot give any more details.\" </p> <p>Cadbury, the prospective buyer, was reticent about the sale, warning that the talks \"may not lead to an eventual agreement\". </p> <p>Orangina is profitable, but Pernod Ricard is focusing on its core wines and spirits business and does not have the resources to develop the Orangina brand internationally at the same time. The business employs around 1,000 people, mainly in France. </p> <p>The move comes amid a change in strategic direction for Cadbury, which last year sold off most of its non-U.S. soft drinks to Coca-Cola for $1bn (\u00a3685m) to focus on US soft drinks and expand its global confectionery business. </p> <p>But difficulties in pulling off a big confectionery deal have caused investors unease over Cadbury's large cash pile and forced it back into the drinks arena, with deals in the US and Australasia struck this month. </p> <p>\"Cadbury is likely to find bigger deals and bigger savings in the beverage market than in confectionery,\" said food industry analyst Andrew Saunders at HSBC. </p> <p>Paradoxically, Cadbury's plans to sell its mainland European soft drinks business to Coca-Cola were blocked by European regulators, and now France is Cadbury's third largest soft drinks profit centre after north America and Australasia.

  "<p>You can spot a world music lover at a hundred yards. No, it's not the wholesome sandals, nor the penchant for authentic pronunciation whereby Chilly becomes Chillay; Youssou N'Dour becomes Youssou-ngngn-D'or, said with much feeling and nasal flourish to boot. No, you'll be able to pick the samba sorts and the merengue masses out by the bags - nay, not the battered rucksacks with lots of exotic stickers - under their sad eyes. Sad ever since Andy Kershaw was unceremoniously dumped by Radio 1; tired ever since they first got into global rhythms. </p> <p>Found only in the wee small hours of Radioland, world music is as popular as Welsh language Open University Quantum Physics programmes on the telly when pitted against Friends. In an attempt to dispel negative publicity following Kershaw's departure from the network, Radio 1 has mailed out a tape called One World to reviewers, complete with a coy little press release headed New World Order on Radio 1 (very Third Reich). </p> <p>It's a smasher - some of the very best global music on the station from the past few years as played by Annie Nightingale, John Peel and Gilles Peterson, all of whom, I'll wager, took inspiration from the entirely absent Kershaw. The cassette also promotes the highly fabutastic thing that is Peterson's current series of the same name <strong> One World</strong> , which has so far brought sets by Masters at Work and the Nu Yorican Soul Band, DJ Marky and Ian Pooley. </p> <p>This is essential listening, even at the giddy time of midnight to 2am on Thursdays, and this is doubtless the right kind of world music for Radio 1 to be playing in its current manifestation (avowedly young, definitely slick and free of risk), especially when most of us are asleep. You might never know it was on. I think that's the general idea. </p> <p>No, Kershaw had to find a new home, and <strong> World Routes </strong> (Radio 3) it is, at least as a guest presenter. Kershaw will be on the new series for the first time tomorrow night, so do tune in, but the initial programme was left to regular host Lucy Duran. Now, I have enormous respect for Duran, not least because my introduction to world music - Charlie Gillet's Sunday night show on Capital Radio too many moons ago - was peppered by references to her as an ethnomusicologist sage, and so she is. </p> <p>But this profile of Youssou N'Dour left a lot to be desired. Straining to display its credibility, its knowledge (Duran was never more than seven seconds away from interrupting the interview to make sure we knew she knew whatever it was), it was dry and worthy, despite surreal bits of detail, like the fact that N'Dour takes a strong position on litter in Senegal. Don't know if that means he picks it up with one of those magno-sticks or throws it about the place, but still, it's what you cling to in the face of too much dreary specialism. \"Now I have to ask you for a definition of Wolof,\" Duran insisted. Do you know, in all the years I've loved his music, it has never occurred to me to ask. </p> <p>Ronnie Corbett once asked his mother about what it was like to give birth to him, he recalled in <strong> High Hopes </strong> (Radio 4), nuggets of his autobiography. \"They left a swab in,\" was all she would say, mentioning it \"in later life from time to time\".

  "It would be hard to exaggerate the importance of autumn planting. If you possibly can, do it now, rather than delaying until spring. The ground is warm now, so anything hardy that you plant will quickly get established, even if it does appear to be dormant. No plant is ever fully dormant. That is all relative. Yes, you probably will need to water in, and possibly quite thoroughly, but that is far more easily achieved than coping with a spring drought. Once settled in, your autumn plantings will look after themselves and will be able to cope with a spring drought, too. <p>The chief argument brought against planting now is the damage that a hard winter could incur. Well, it is easy enough to defer planting things that are known to be on the tender side, but if only a slight risk was involved I should take it. Remember the run of mild winters that we are enjoying, and take advantage of the situation, whether it is caused by global warming or not. We seem to hear nothing but moans and dire predictions in respect of that; the advantages to us gardeners are crassly overlooked. That is because of the human delight in shaking grizzly locks and predicting the worst. Have nothing to do with all that. </p> <p>The advantages of autumn planting are easily named. Delay until spring, and you'll be pushed for time during a season when everything is on the move and so the job may well end up being put off for yet another year. Daylight saving lasts until the end of next month, so the working day is not yet unreasonably short. All spring-flowering perennials will flower well if settled in now, but they may do so poorly if you leave it until spring, particularly if their roots have to be disturbed. </p> <p>The emphasis on spring is, these days, largely motivated by the garden centres, which prefer to offer their customers plants that are already obviously full of promise - flowering, if possible - and so enable them to cash in on the human urge to get busy when a cheerful spring day reminds us that winter is over. If you have sufficient vision to inter a plant that visually has no appeal at the time of handling it (surely that is not asking too much), you will be streets ahead of those who are guided entirely by impulse. Of course, impulse gets the better of all of us on occasions, and is momentarily a great thrill, but it shouldn't guide all our actions. </p> <p>If it's wet when you need to plant, work off boards so that you don't congeal the soil (I'm thinking of our clay) with your footprints. If the foliage of bedding plants - polyanthus, sweet williams and wallflowers, in particular - is wet, the mess you get it, yourself and your tools into is most frustrating. Try to choose air-dry conditions. </p> <p>If planting trees in turf, don't open up the holes to receive them days, or even a day, before you are ready to plant. An intervening rain will ruin your plans, whereas newly opened-up turf is always friable. For the same reason, if you are replanting perennials in a border - phloxes, for instance - leave their cutting down until you're ready to get busy on lifting and splitting. Beneath their dead or dying remains, the ground will always be workable, even on heavy soil, but not once exposed to the elements. Another reason for leaving the plant until you're ready to deal with it is that you won't have to remember about its height and habit. It will be there in front of you. The same with its neighbours. That is why I am against the wholesale cut-down operations that some gardeners are so fond of weeks or months before they are ready to do the real work of lifting, manuring and splitting. </p> <p>Another thing: cutters-down habitually leave quite a length of stem on the plants they cut. True, these act as a reminder as to the plant's whereabouts, but these dead stems, when dried and hard, can deal vicious jabs and also harbour hibernating earwigs and other pests (as well as ladybirds and other beneficent insects, but it is best to keep quiet about them when pursuing an argument). If I really do need a reminder of where each clump in a group is, I leave just one shortened stalk and remove that once its purpose has been served. </p> <p>When replanting a perennial with a dense mass of roots and dormant shoots, pull or chop it apart and use it only for replanting the strongest pieces, which are usually located on the outside of a clump, where there was least competition. How big should the pieces be that you replant? That varies with the perennial. I don't want to wait a year before I get a good display, so with phloxes, again, I replant pieces that have several dormant buds, rather than just one. With vigorous, suckering Michaelmas daisies, on the other hand, one shoot with roots attached will be enough, because these single shoots will, in the very first season, make a great branching aerial structure that is perfectly capable of filling a large space with masses of blossom. You learn as you go along. </p> <p>I don't believe in a periodic holocaust, either, replanting an entire border every so many years. The piecemeal approach is far more satisfactory. Indeed, in a mixed border there is no alternative. Make up your mind which groups are looking tired (best seen when still growing) and replant them, leaving the rest for another year. So, I would replant some phlox groups, but never all in the same year</p>",
  "Two weeks have gone by, but the turmoil of those uncertain days remains seared on my mind.

I hope you have an understanding with the black-clad forces of the global emporium, or you might well find Klein at your door next. </p> <p><b> Anne Sweeney</b> <br> Lancaster <br></p> <p>In an article on the power of symbolism in global capitalism, it was neat of you to put a photograph of Bill Clinton on the same page as one of a model for Gap. The Republicans really could learn a thing or two from Weekend about subliminal messages. </p> <p><b> Simon Burton-Jones</b> <br> Bromley, Kent <br></p> <p>So, Naomi Klein, a rich Canadian, has thrown away her Nike trainers and galvanised the forces of anarchism. Maybe next week you could tell us that the Beatles invented rock'n'roll, that David Beckham invented football, and that Keith Flett was but a figment of my imagination. </p> <p><b> Colin Billett</b><br> Bewdley, Worcestershire <br></p> <p>Naomi Klein's No Logo brilliantly demonstrates how capitalism stinks. The big question, which Klein ducks, is how to change the system. Perhaps the protesters in Prague have the germ of a solution. </p> <p><b> Keith Flett</b> <br> London N17 <br></p> <p>Julie Burchill (September 16) including David Baddiel in the same sentence as 'Nazi Germany and fascist Japan'? What has he ever done, other than make thousands of people laugh and, no doubt, pay a couple of million pounds in taxes, with obvious benefits for Britain? </p> <p>The fact that Baddiel's grandparents escaped Nazi Germany makes her comment even more deeply insulting and ignorant. </p> <p><b> Rachel Foot</b> <br> Wraxhall, Bristol <br></p> <p>Was Ken Russell (The Questionnaire, September 23) not asked, 'How often do you have sex'? If he was, was the answer unprintable? </p> <p><b> Richard Proctor</b> <br> London SE13 <br></p> <p>I have almost finished page 15 of the Slow Down issue (September 9). Is this a record? </p> <p><b> Alan White</b> <br> London E6 <br></p> <p>\u0095 Guardian Weekend, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER.
