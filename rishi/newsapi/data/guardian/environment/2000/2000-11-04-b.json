  "<p>It is the notion of carrying everything you need on your own back which makes travelling so exhilarating, but a rucksack can also make the difference between a comfortable trip and an agonising one which leaves you with more memories of sore shoulders than mountain vistas. </p> <p>There is a huge range of backpacks available, depending on your priorities. The lighter, more expensive, and the most professional of rucksacks cost around \u00a3200, while a perfectly functional but slightly heavier version costs half that amount. </p> <p>Ideally, packs should be tried on before purchase. What looks like a fairly simple holdall is a precise piece of engineering, and many models which appear similar differ in the way in which they fit the body and distribute the weight of the contents. </p> <p>There are now several outdoor gear websites which undercut hiking and camping shops; <a href=\"http://www.WildDay.com\" target=\"_NEW\">WildDay.com</a>, a Scottish site, claims to be up to 60% cheaper than the high street, for instance. Shop via these sites and you lose the opportunity to put the pack on your back and have an expert show you how to adjust straps and make personal recommendations. Site 9feet.com gets round this by offering exchange of goods with free postage. </p> <p>The first issue to address when choosing a rucksack is size, or capacity, which is measured in litres. For travelling, standard sizes are 65 litres, moving up to 80 if it is a long trip or if you need to carry food. If you are walking, then a daysack of 25-35 litres should be sufficient. Overnighters should look at something between the two. </p> <p>Next to consider is whether to go for an adjustable back system or not. The benefits are that you can fine-tune the fit and also that more than one person can use the pack and adjust it to their body shape. It is also, according to 9feet.com, preferable if you have a short back but do not want to compromise on the amount of kit you carry. They are, however, heavier than the fixed-back versions. </p> <p>There are also different models for men and women. Mike Pleasants, a Duke of Edinburgh award leader from Bournemouth, says: \"All the ladies I know who walk use the female-specific packs. The hip belt and shoulder straps are far more comfortable.\" Backpacks for women have a flared base so they do not rub against the hip belt and the straps curve so they fit round the base rather than cutting in. If you are a small man you may also find the female versions more comfortable, and the branding is normally discreet. </p> <p>The final decision is whether to buy a top-loading pack, or a side loader, which unzips like a suitcase. \"This depends what you are using it for,\" says Mr Pleasants. \"If you are taking a lot of trains, then it may be better for you as you can carry it like a holdall. But if you are going to be outdoors, then I prefer the top-loading variety as if I need to get something out and it is muddy, I can just stand the pack on its base without getting the whole thing dirty.\" </p> <p>So which bags do the experts recommend? For travelling, Blacks, the outdoor equipment shop, predictably picks one of its own, the Blacks Governor, at \u00a389.99. Blacks' Steven Faust says that this 60-litre pack is \"a large volume multi-capacity multi-purpose travel-orientated rucksack. It has a large main section with detachable day- sack and bum bag. This is also a zip-away panel which can be pulled over the straps. It also has a top grab handle.\" </p> <p>But 9feet.com comes down in favour of Karrimor's Cougar model. The 50-70 litre L version (the extra capacity comes when all the pockets are full) is designed for women. 9feet buyer Matt Jones says: \"This is a very strong buy. It is light, has good durability of fabric and fulfils all the basic needs of the backpacker. It costs \u00a3110. WildDay carries the smaller Cougar 50 at \u00a390. </p> <p> For men, Mr Jones recommends the standard version of the Cougar 50-70 product, which costs \u00a3110 at 9feet and Blacks and just \u00a390 at WildDay. He adds that while trendy brands such as North Face and MacPac are high quality, they are overpriced. </p> <p>He also favours Karrimor for travel packs. Its range is called Global and the bags feature detachable daysacks. The top of the range version has a pull-out trolley handle. Prices range from \u00a3140-\u00a3160 at 9feet and Blacks. </p> <p>For hillwalking, a daysack should suffice. It should allow you to store additional clothing you may need, exterior pockets for a compass and water bottle, padded straps and hip belt and a mesh separating the back from the pack. Mr Pleasants favours the Regatta X-ert 35, which is generally classified as a rucksack rather than a daysack because of its size: \"It's a bit bigger than most daysacks which means I can fit in things like a first-aid pack when I am leading a group.\" This costs \u00a326.99 at Oswald Bailey and \u00a324 at WildDay. </p> <p>Mr Faust at Blacks opts for the Peter Storm Kinetic bag, at \u00a324.99. This 20-25 litre model was recently voted best buy by Country Walking magazine and features multiple compartments, a compression system to stabilise the load, an air flow mesh back, reflective trim and a pocket which will carry a cycle helmet. Mr Jones, however, prefers the Lowe Alpine Pax 25, at \u00a330 on 9feet. </p> <p>If keeping the contents of your pack dry is a priority, a new range from Craghopper is recommended by 9feet.com. \"They've had great reviews and are not much more expensive than ordinary packs,\" says Mr Jones. The Drypack 50 costs \u00a380 on 9feet.com, and \u00a387.50 on WildDay.com. It also comes in 30, 35, 45 and 65 litre varieties. </p> <p>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.blacks.co.uk\">www.blacks.co.uk</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.9feet.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www. 9feet.com</a>.&gt;<br> <a href=\"http://www.field-trek.co.uk\">www.field-trek.co.uk</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.wildday.com\">www.wildday.com</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.oswaldbailey.co.uk\">www.oswaldbailey.co.uk</a><br> 9feet also has a \"call an expert\" service on 0845-6011-758.</p>",
  "<p>Welcome to the global dance. It started in the late 1980s with Acid House - a simple, hypnotic brand of electronic dance music formed in the underground gay discos of New York, Chicago and Detroit, mixed up with trashy Euro disco on the dancefloors of Ibiza and often enjoyed alongside a new designer drug called Ecstasy. London and Manchester were the first British cities to succumb to it, but nothing this good could stay secret for long: by 1990, there was at least one big dance club in every town in the UK, and the culture was spreading all over the world. </p> <p>Once, only weird kids wanted to dress up and dance all night - now this kind of clubbing is a mainstream leisure activity everywhere: from Tokyo to Telford, Birmingham to Bali. And it shows no sign of ending. The music has evolved, adapted, spun off into endless confusing categories and sub-groups, but the basic premise stays the same: repetitive electronic beats, big smiles, and huge crowds giving it lots of hands-in-the-air abandon. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the clubs have got bigger, boasting massive sound systems and extravagant decor that will shock those of you whose last dance experience was a chrome disco with swirly carpets, a few flashing lights and a mirror ball. </p> <p>In the past decade, major British clubs such as Ministry of Sound, Cream and Gatecrasher have become international youth culture brands, big businesses selling CDs, magazines and clothes and organising parties all over the globe. Our star DJs earn more in one night than some of us do in a year, leading a life many jet-setters would envy: summers in Ibiza or Ayia Napa, winters playing clubs in Australia, South America or South Africa, and regular monthly gigs in New York clubs. </p> <p>The scene is now a huge global business with its own stars, its own social calendar with regular annual fixtures such as the gay mardi gras in Sydney, the Love Parade in Berlin, and the Miami Winter Music conference. It has also bred a whole new kind of tourism - clubbers who travel the world less to see the sights than to experience the nights. This is a guide to some of the club capitals of the world, but search in any big city and you'll find something similar. As the record says, \"Let the music take control.\" </p> <p><strong>Berlin</strong></p> <p>\"Berlin is such a great clubbing city because there has always been an interesting mix of clubbers and music since the East and West joined together\"<br><strong> DJ Paul Van Dyk</strong> </p> <p><strong> Local DJs </strong> Westbam, Sven Vath, Paul Van Dyk, Timo Maas, Jazzanova.<br><strong> UK/American DJs </strong> Carl Cox, Jeff Mills, Derrick Carter and any of the big Techno names. </p> <p><strong> Icon</strong> Cantian Strasse 15 / Mila Strasse<br>Door: Dm10, Dm20 for special events <br> Housed in a building that used to be a brewery, this is the oldest Drum 'n' Bass venue in the city and has played host to famous DJs such as Grooverider, Peshay,and Doc Scott. </p> <p><strong> Rive Gauche</strong> Friedrichstrasse 105 <br> Door: Dm 20 (weekends &amp; Special events), Dm10 (Thursdays, when they have an after-work night) <br>Mainly populated by people in advertising, party people.

  "The sun was setting over the black middle-class Crenshaw district in Los Angeles as he arrived to loud cheers from a crowd estimated by police at 8,000. They had been waiting patiently for around two hours to catch a glimpse of their hero and they chanted \"four more years!\" as he took the stage against a back-drop of palm trees and the hint of a pale November moon. <p>Here was the man they wanted to see elected to the presidency next Tuesday and he bathed in the warmth of their affection like the pro he is. The only problem was that this was not Al Gore receiving the blessing of black LA, but Bill Clinton bidding his long goodbye to the most loyal of his supporters. </p> <p>The mood was upbeat in the Baldwin Hills plaza as the afternoon began. This was clearly not George W Bush territory: people sported badges proclaiming \"I didn't vote for his daddy either\" and joined in chants of \"no son of a Bush!\" </p> <p>As befitted a star, there were countless support acts. The Reverend Cecil Murray asked everyone to pray: \"Lord, thank-you for the wisdom to make wise choices.\" </p> <p>Wyclef Jean, who first came to fame with the Fugees, had composed a special song:\"If you want to know who I'm going to vote for, I'm going to vote for Al Gore\", which somehow seemed unlikely to make it on to his next CD. </p> <p>The Crenshaw high school marching band and the Montgomery high school steel band from San Diego strutted their stuff. </p> <p>Mr Clinton finally arrived in a blue sports coat and red tie, punching the air and giving his best commander-in-chief salute to the seated elders - \"the chronologically-gifted\", as they had been described earlier, this being California. </p> <p>He managed to pick up on both the religious theme and the feeling that he was the headlining act at the end of a very long tour. </p> <p>\"I know I'm sort of preaching to the saved,\" he said. \"But thank you, California, Los Angeles and Watts for the support you have given to me and Al Gore.\" </p> <p>Like a road-weary rock star, he had slightly misplaced his location because Watts is a few miles down the road but no one was rushing to consult their street maps and he could have said \"thank you, Hemel Hempstead\" and they would still have forgiven him. </p> <p>Mr Clinton has supposedly been hurt by the failure of the Gore campaign to involve him more. He has come to Los Angeles, San Francisco and Oakland at the request of the Democratic Governor Gray Davis, who has watched Mr Bush creep up in the polls to within seven percentage points of Mr Gore in a state that the vice-president must win to succeed next week. </p> <p>The enthusiasm Mr Clinton engenders, the clear affection in which he is held, makes Mr Gore's decision to keep him at least at arm's length seem an odd one. </p> <p>The president reminded them of when he and Mr Gore had come seeking their votes in 1992 and how much life had changed since then. </p> <p>\"The economy was in turmoil, society was divided, there were riots in Los Angeles,\" he said. \"This election is just as important.\" </p> <p>He told them that \"the people of Watts feel they have as much say in the White House as my friends in Beverly Hills\". </p> <p>\"We tried to give you one America,\" he said. </p> <p>Perhaps remembering his mission, he told the crowd: \"I want to say something about Al Gore: he has experience, he understands the future, how it will be shaped by the internet and the global economy.\" </p> <p>It was not perhaps the most convincing of endorsements - a little like saying of someone that they have lovely eyes - but he made it clear that everyone had a duty to get their friends out to vote and preserve \"fairness for all legal immigrants ... a woman's right to choose, and civil rights and human rights\". </p> <p>Since there were many who had done well in the audience, he carried on his theme of inclusion. \"With Al Gore and Joe Lieberman and the Democrats, the rich folks keep getting richer and so do the middle class and working people. We're all going forward together!\" </p> <p>He ended on an even more enthusiastic note about the man who has been his deputy for eight years. </p> <p>\"Al Gore is a good man who makes good decisions and with your help he will be a great president of the United States.\" </p> <p>His speech was brief and his farewell a poignant one: \"I can't thank you enough for how good you've been to me. Thank you and God bless you all!\" </p> <p>The sounds of the Four Tops singing \"Reach Out, I'll Be There\" blasted out as cannons fired red, white and blue confetti over the retreating crowds and the security men on the rooftops packed away binoculars the size of cider flagons and gave the all clear. </p> <p>But the problem for the crowds streaming home was that Mr Clinton won't be there for very much longer. </p> <p>\"I'm a Clinton fan,\" said Florence Dyer, who, like the president, had grown up in Little Rock, Arkansas. \"If he was running again, I'd vote for him again. I can remember when my parents couldn't vote because they were black and that's why it's important that people vote now. But a lot of black people have been so beaten down they think their vote doesn't count. I think Al Gore's style throws people off some, but you can't ask a man to change and as for George Bush - he's like a cock rooster.\" </p> <p>\"He's a motivator,\" said Ruthie Cook, 68, who runs a nearby cleaning services business. \"And he sure did bring more of our people into government than anyone else in the history of my life.\" </p> <p>\"I'm sad he's leaving,\" said a young investment banker, Tianna Quarles, who said that she had benefited through affirmative action educational policies. \"He preaches inclusion, he still believes in affirmative action. He's my hero.\" </p> <p>Ms Quarles said she would happily have voted for him for a third term if such a thing existed and was uncertain as to whether Al Gore would win her over next Tuesday. </p> <p>But as her words trailed off in thought, the president was off in his motorcade to visit his friends in Beverly Hills. Then it was on to the Bay Area where yesterday he was once again trying to preach to the saved and save his vice-president. </p>",
  "<p>The global superhighway is so congested that many companies are unable to register their name with the dot.com suffix. Many television companies are finding it easier to use the .tv domain. </p> <p>This may seem a million miles from the west Pacific, except that the .tv name is the property of a tiny group of Micronesian islands, Tuvalu. </p> <p>Last year, the 10,000 islanders made \u00a310.5 million from licensing their domain and look set to earn a great deal more. They have few other sources of income - the sale of fishing licenses in their extensive territorial waters raises \u00a34 million a year, but there is no industry, negligible agriculture and tourism is virtually nonexistent. </p> <p>The windfall will come in handy as the advent of global warming has brought the fear that the islands, which seldom rise more than 4m above sea level, may not be able to survive the coastal erosion. The population lives with the possibility that they may have to move within 50 years if they are not to be washed away. The scientific evidence is at present ambiguous, but the government is already moving to buy a plot of land in Fiji a quarter the land size of Tuvalu, as a precaution in case of evacuation. </p> <p>In September, Tuvalu became the 189th member of the United Nations, and the government hopes this will give it a stronger platform from which to bring its concerns about global warming to the attention of the international community. </p> <p>Wherever you are on Tuvalu's main island of Funafuti, you can hear the roar of the ocean. Pacific it may be in name, but pacific it is not in nature. On the eastern side of the narrow strip of island, the waves thunder in over the stony beach, while on the western side there is a calm lagoon suitable for swimming. The space between is, in places, barely more than the width of a motorway. Nowhere does it take more than five minutes to walk from coast to coast. </p> <p>A bumpy track runs from one end of the island to the other, a primitive thoroughfare lined by palm trees and pandanus with their decoratively-complex roots. On the lagoon side, there is a verge of just a few feet before the dip down to the beach; on the ocean side, one, or sometimes two, simple houses can fit in before the Pacific coast is reached. There are pigs, mostly confined to pens, and chickens running around, but no cattle or sheep. The soil is not rich enough to grow much beyond coconuts and bananas, but the sea produces plentiful amounts of fish. Fishermen weigh huge tuna on scales in the street; small boys carry them cradled proudly in their arms. </p> <p>The reason for Funafuti's long, thin shape is that it is part of the rim of an old submerged crater, with the circumference completed by a dotted line of uninhabited islets. Several hours by boat beyond these islets are the eight other islands of Tuvalu (which means \"eight standing\"). Only Funafuti has an airstrip, just as only Funafuti has a public electricity network. This summer, the boat that travels between the islands has been in New Zealand for repairs, and one of the country's half-dozen doctors has been stranded on an outer islands for months awaiting its return. </p> <p>Tuvalu is a haven of beauty and simplicity. You can have the beach to yourself for as far as you can see in both directions; The sun shines brightly and hotly - the country lies only 8 degrees south of the equator - and yet the sea breeze brings constant relief. Most water is good to drink because it is rainwater coming straight off the roof. Malaria is non-existent and there is comparatively little nuisance from insects other than mosquitoes. And as a former British colony (the Ellice Islands), everyone speaks English as well as Tuvaluan. </p> <p>It is not a rich island - even on Funafuti more people have fishing nets than have fridges (46% to 43%). But the culture is rich and unspoiled by tourism. Asked if they ever have tourists, the receptionist in Tuvalu's one hotel shook her head in a puzzled way, as though it were a strange idea. Rather the hotel caters for a slow trickle of technicians and government advisers. </p> <p>Yet once or twice a year tourists do arrive, in a load of a hundred or so from a cruise ship. They sleep on the ship, but by day they are all over the island, offending the locals by walking down the road \"half naked\" - that is, in bikinis. Then, after a couple of days the ship moves on and the Tuvaluans sigh with relief. </p> <p>The government takes a different attitude: it would like to promote the tourist industry for obvious financial reasons, although it believes their facilities would have to be upgraded to meet the requirements of \"fussy\" foreigners. </p> <p>The Tuvaluans are gentle, black, beautiful if a little buxom, and wear flowers in their hair. The children wave at you as you pass and cry out \"bye bye\", proud of the English they learn in school, while the adults appreciate being greeted in their own language with \"Talofa\" (\"Hello\"). </p> <p>The Tuvaluan phrase book was brought out in 1945 and includes among its useful phrases for visitors: \"This is our gift which we have brought you. It is only a trifle and not at all fitting for you, but our island has nothing of value to offer, only talo and eggs and a few fowls.\" \"Lift up the screens and let the fresh breeze fan the patient.\" \"He grabbed at the rooster and its tail feathers came out.\" \"Is the post straight or is it leaning towards the sea?\" And: \"Don't you know that the forequarters of the turtle are taboo for they are reserved for the chiefs.\" </p> <p>Christianity is very influential, and 96% of the people are Congregationalists, members of the Ekalesia Kelisiano Tuvalu (Tuvalu Christian Church). Bells ring out every evening calling the families to prayer, and it is common to see people walking around with bibles in their hands. </p> <p>The main church on Funafuti is the largest building on the island, on Sundays filled with people sitting cross-legged on coconut matting. The women wear shimmering white dresses, and sit on the right-hand side, and the men put on their Sunday best - shirts, ties and sulus (skirts) - and sit on the left. The singing is hauntingly beautiful. </p> <p>Everyone seems to be the cousin of someone else you have met, and everything is on such a small scale that you soon feel at home. There is only one newspaper, Tuvalu Echoes, and it comes out once a month, in English and Tuvaluan. The prison has just five inmates, including the former general secretary of the Church, imprisoned for fraud. </p> <p>The governor-general's house faces the airstrip adorned with a little outside wall some six inches high. In the square by the air terminal are all the central facilities: the craft shop, bank, post office, telecom, police station, broadcasting house and the hotel. Few buildings have notices up, as the local people know which battered, unlocked door leads into which office. Two-storey buildings are rare and are treated as landmarks. </p> <p>There is only one mini-roundabout, while the pitted road destroys a vehicle's suspension in a matter of months. As a consequence, most people travel on foot, on bicycle, or motorbike. There is only one \"Stop\" sign, where the road reaches the air terminal, and it is painted by hand. </p> <p>The airstrip, built by the American forces during the second world war, is used for more purposes than landing the two scheduled flights per week. Given the state of the road, it provides a better base for parades and football, and even for sleeping out at night, the open space attracting the wind from the sea that brings relief from the oppressive heat. </p> <p>Tuvalu is a little Garden of Eden, with its long palm-lined beaches, its unspoilt culture, its colourfully dressed, flower-adorned, friendly people, and its relaxed pace of life, which makes one feel like never moving on. A US state department report last year described it as: \"egalitarian, democratic and respectful of human rights\". </p> <p>One is tempted to ask: what is the catch? Well, there are plenty of problems that sap energy and demand patience. There is insufficient capacity in the electricity network, so there are power cuts for approximately one third of the time. Another problem is that the salty sea-wind, for all its welcome breeze, spells death to machinery, for rust is endemic. Drought can also strike between April and November, when those with larger roofs to collect rainwater have to supply the smaller homes with buckets of water. </p> <p>But despite the frustrations, those who have once heard the sound of Tuvaluan children, united in song, piercing the night darkness with their vigorous harmonies, will fall in love with the islands' simplicity and beauty. They will understand the people's sense of foreboding over sea-level rise, threatening to make Tuvalu a third-world victim of first-world greed. No wonder UN secretary-general Kofi Annan described climate change on Tuvalu as \"trouble in paradise\".</p> <p><strong> The practicals</strong><br> </p> <p>Key Travel (0161-819 8900, <a href=\"http://www.keytravel.co.uk\">www.keytravel.co.uk</a>) sells BA World Discovery tickets London-Suva, Fiji for \u00a31.380 in December, \u00a3985 January-March, and Air Fiji Suva-Funafuti, Tuvalu for \u00a3215 return, although schedules for the latter service is erratic. </p> <p>Vaiaku Lagi hotel, (tel: +688 20500, fax 688 20503) is government-owned and modern but lacks character, \u00a335 a double room, (all prices plus 10% tax and plus breakfast).

  "<p> Floods, gales and blizzards alarm as well as harm us now because they seem to be incontrovertible proof of global warming. Even a small rise in the prevailing temperature of the world's atmosphere changes the geography and severity of weather events, increasing the risk of floods in such low-lying areas as the Ganges and Mekong deltas and some European coasts, while threatening to shift the flow of ocean currents which govern continental climates, triggering droughts elsewhere. </p> <p>Residents of countries with stable weather patterns, manifesting the same quanta of temperature in summer and winter, and with identifiable sap-ascending springtimes and leaf-descending autumns regular enough to set a watch by, once had little call to discuss the subject. It was only in places with unreliably changeable weather, like Britain, that the art of earnest and endless debate about it was fully developed. Now everywhere people squint at the sky and comment on the unusual quantity or dearth of rain, or the increased ferocity of winds and the rising height of tides. </p> <p>Small changes have big effects. Britain was once part of the European land mass, and the Thames was a tributary of the Rhine, whose mouth was the English Channel. Climate-induced changes in sea levels inundated the shallow plains once continuous between the fenlands of East Anglia and the Low Countries. For some time after the initial flooding there was a large island between Britain and continental Europe, where the Dogger Bank now lies under the North Sea's cold waters. That too sank, and historians say that the peoples of Britain, once they had been separated from their mainland brethren, lapsed two thousand years behind them in agricultural, technological and military development. There is a stern modern moral in that fact. </p> <p>Global trends in weather seem remote until unusual storms demolish our woodlands and drown our village streets. But daily weather is intimately present, affecting moods and hopes, like a member of the family. \"A cloudy day, or a little sunshine,\" remarked Addison, \"have as great an influence on many constitutions as the most real blessings or misfortunes.\" Drawing back the curtains gives a first frame to the day for people who answer Addison's description; from what they see outside they deduce their feelings. Most think that a sparkling sun in a cerulean sky is a prompt for happiness, whereas weeks of cloud make one feel trapped as if inside a Tupperware box. But Gissing's observation, in his essay on winter, can correct this view: \"For the man sound in body and serene of mind there is no such thing as bad weather; every sky has its beauty, and storms which whip the blood do but make it pulse more vigorously.\" </p> <p>The Irish call a day of cloud and drizzle a \"soft\" day; the description supports this thought that every weather is lovely in its way. Gissing's mention of storms reminds one that our recent misadventures are not, in fact, unusual for these islands, even though their increasing frequency suggests a sinister trend. Shakespeare gives us tremendous storms in Lear and Macbeth, and although the tempest in the Tempest is Prospero's own, and occurs in foreign parts, the idea for it was home-grown. There are storms likewise in the novels of Hardy and Dorothy L Sayers, the latter describing an actual one in the 1930s which flattened woods and decapitated houses across southern England. </p> <p>These events - like the Victorian earthquake that shook Suffolk - seem improbable in the usually moderate fluctuations between degrees of coolness and wetness affecting these islands, occasionally teased by glimpses of sun; until we remember the droughts of the last quarter-century, and reflect on the tornado that startled Bognor's burghers last weekend. </p> <p>The well-worn saying \"Every cloud has a silver lining\" is especially apt in this connection for, as EB White wrote, \"Extreme cold\" [from which generalise \"extreme weather\"] \"when it first arrives seems to generate cheerfulness and sociability. For a few hours all life's dubious problems are dropped in favour of the clear and congenial task of keeping alive.\" </p>",
  "<p>Until Thursday, when her house in Shrewsbury was flooded for the first time in 60 years, Denise Jones had barely considered global warming as a scientific theory, let alone a reality. </p> <p>\"I know my kids and Friends of the Earth go on about it but I thought it just meant nice warm summers and I was quite in favour. I didn't know it meant floods and storms and what we have got now,\" she said, craning to hear Tony Blair who was visiting the drowning Shropshire town. </p> <p>Mrs Jones's new understanding of climate change follows a series of ever stronger statements in the past 10 days from government and opposition, the environment agency and green groups, all of whom have been quick to give the public a geography lesson and link extreme weather in Britain with lifestyle and global change. </p> <p>The need to prepare people for climate change may be as much fuelled by political expediency - the weather is seen by some as fortuitously deflecting some attention from the fuel and transport crises - as by alarming new UN and EU reports in the last 10 days. </p> <p>The most worrying leaked out from the UN-sponsored intergovernmental panel on climate change, a grouping of 200 of the world's leading climatologists. </p> <p>In their first big report in five years they linked the warming climate of the last 20 years with man made carbon emissions, and predicted rapidly accelerating global warming with increasingly severe weather. </p> <p>A European commission report warned of a more extreme, stormier world. It specifically said Britain would have mild winters with rain in very heavy bursts, but with hot summers and droughts, too. </p> <p>The reports confirmed government studies which say that flooding is now twice as frequent as 100 years ago and that we can expect to see a tenfold increase in flood risk over the next century. A flood that might now happen on average once in 100 years could occur as frequently as every 10 or 20 years in future. </p> <p>\"There have been floods somewhere every month in Britain for the last 32 months. Up to 5m people live in flood risk areas in England where there are 1.8m properties valued at over \u00a3200bn,\" said Geoff Spence, the agency's director of water management. </p> <p>He added: \"The lesson to be drawn from the past month, which has seen six times average rainfall in parts, and more than one inch falling in an hour, is that we must educate ourselves, prepare and adapt.\" </p> <p>New policy guidance will be published next month on developments on flood plains, giving planners authority to decide what should and should not be allowed. </p> <p>The government estimates global warming could mean spending an extra \u00a312bn on flood defences in the next 50 years, but has only committed an extra \u00a330m. Yesterday the environment agency said: \"We argued for an extra \u00a3100m. There has been under-investment in the past.\" </p> <p>How flood money is spent is likely to be the subject of debate between ecologists and engineers in government. Traditionally, the Ministry of Agriculture has favoured big sea defences, big engineering and more field drainage. This is criticised for increasing the run off from fields and pushing water downstream where it can flood communities. The environment agency and the Department of the Environment are moving to a more sensitive, holistic approach. </p> <p>Yesterday John Boardman, head of the environmental change unit at Oxford University, played down the influence of global warming, saying that the recent floods were caused largely by changes in farm practices. </p> <p>Extensive cultivation of winter wheat sown in September, leaving the land bare in the wettest parts of the year, together with overstocking of sheep on the uplands which leads to erosion, is the cause of much flooding, he added. </p> <p>Mr Spence said: \"The run off of water from bare fields is 10-100 times greater than from a field with grass. It has led to increased property damage.\" </p> <p>He called for the government subsidies to be targeted at specific problem areas and more schemes and grant money to help communities, and farmers. The farmers would then be able to construct small dams using special payments. </p> <p>\"There are many places in the southern Netherlands, Belgium and northern France, with histories of property damage by runoff, where radical approaches involving cooperation between local communities and farmers and EU funding have started to make progress in providing protection\", Mr Spence said. </p> <p>\"Since the war the drainage system has been geared to get water off the fields faster. Because of the switch to winter cereals we have lost the big plough furrows that used to collect the water. We should be trying to keep water in the catchment areas, treating the cause of floods rather than the symptoms.\" </p> <p>He also said he would like to see the development of \"porous cities\", where pavements soak in water, drains run into tanks and water is prevented from immediately running into rivers. </p> <p>Ecologist Chris Baines, who has worked with Mr Meacher and farm minister Elliot Morley on the rural white paper, said: \"We should consider blocking the drains in upland moors to let the peat bogs saturate again. These giant sponges regulate the run off, but they also slow the rate of climate change.\"</p>",
  "<p> It was The Onion, the online satirical chronicler of America's \"dumb century\", which ran a deadpan editorial entitled \"We need more movies where monkeys give the finger\". An arguable surfeit of such movies, or a suspected cultural climate of cynicism and exhaustion in which they will be increasingly tolerated, is where the fashionable \"dumbing down\" debate applies to the cinema.</p> <p>In many ways it is obtuse to fling accusations of \"dumb\" at Hollywood or individual Hollywood products. After all, isn't film a populist art? Haven't its most glorious and compelling works derived their brilliance from their creators knowing what a mass audience wants? Doesn't the energy and exuberance of their work depend to some degree on their exclusion from the simpering civilities of high art? </p> <p>Brilliant films come off the Hollywood production line all the time. But the dangers of dumb reside not merely in the kind of movies made, but the way they have come to be distributed, exhibited, criticised and understood. Hollywood's colonisation of world markets and national cultures is now all but complete, and like all colonisation, depends on a degree of collaboration with and admiration - covert and overt - for the victor. (With some honourable exceptions, the British lottery-funded film has unfortunately become a byword for dumb, with many a substandard script taken out of the bottom drawer to take advantage of the cash bonanza, with the presiding authorities now apparently seeking to redeem the situation by aping the American industry.)</p> <p>This is not simply a naive matter of political correctness or art-buff snobbery, of believing that Hollywood is always schlock or that there is no such thing as a bad Iranian film. Some quintessentially bad films can be middlebrow art movies saturated with their own sense of superiority.</p> <p> Rather, it is a question of vitality, variety and choice. Repertory cinema, where serendipitous discoveries can be made, is disappearing in favour of multiplex conformism. Increasingly, the work of film-makers like Kiorastami, Ozu, Fellini, Bergman, Ray, Powell and Antonioni is omitted both from what we can see on the big screen and from any discussion of cinema's history.</p> <p>As far as postwar Hollywood is concerned, a distinctively political case for the prosecution on the dumbing charge focuses on the terrified response to the McCarthyite bullying of the early 50s. This capacity for cowardice and self-dumbing is alleged to have resurfaced in the 70s with the Spielberg-inspired trend for \"juvenilisation\" of the movies. In the 80s, Hollywood president Ronald Reagan concealed his native shrewdness in favour of projecting a down-home, aw-shucks innocent who invoked Rambo in support of US interventionism, a Hollywood archetype who attained his apotheosis in the insidious Forrest Gump - whose moral superiority lay in his low IQ. And in the 90s, Paul Fussell identified \"dumb\" movies as the summer blockbusters subservient to their own hype: movies which take up less cultural space than their publicity. The apogee of this species of dumbness is the calamitous The Phantom Menace.</p> <p>Even in this Hollywoodised context, moreover, Hollywood seems not to have a history now. A creeping amnesia is setting in. Gilbert Adair suggests that cinephilia, as it is conventionally understood, has given way to a retail ubiquity of movie images, denuded of history and context. Put simply, students have posters of Marilyn Monroe with her skirts billowing round her waist, but how many can name the movie from which that image is taken? </p> <p>The other factor is the explosion of movie discussion on the web. This is in one way a thrilling, historic democratisation of film criticism. Now the old adage \"everyone's a critic\" is literally true. The one-party state of critical journalism is broken: anyone can publish their views on the net and get a global readership for them. </p> <p>But there is the gloomy question of quality control: critical discourse is supplanted by anorak fan-speak and chat-room argument. The giant Internet Movie Database has become a wildly popular reference resource all over the world, but as it is managed by Amazon.com with an eye to marketing its videos and DVDs, it entrusts its \"plot summary\" for each film to any punter who cares to file one, on the basis, presumably, that the customer is always right. </p> <p>But there are anti-dumbing forces ready to promote the cause of what, a little reductively, is known as World Cinema. The dynamism of Bollywood challenges the Los Angeles hegemony and acts as an antidote to dumbness and uniformity. Then there is the inexorable growth of festival culture: already, the Martell Tour of French Cinema is very popular and has led to French movies being picked up for distribution. It is at these festivals that world cinema can be seen, unencumbered by the pressure of distribution. Maybe it is here that a grassroots revolt against multiplex dullness, and dumbness, can begin.</p> <p>\u0095 Peter Bradshaw is film critic of the Guardian</p>",
  "<p> Jack Nicholson once described her as a cross between a fawn and a Buick. And it is true that, though petite, Jessica Lange has an unexpectedly powerful physique. She looks strong, sexy, and her skin glows with good health. She has a vibrant presence, though there is little of the glitz of Hollywood about her apart from a slightly starry self-consciousness. For Lange is the product of the landscape into which she was born and to which she has returned to raise her own family. Minnesota. A state as far north as you can go before America turns into Canada, a land of dense forests in the north and wild, bleak prairies in the south; harsh winters, a hardy population, many of whose jobs rely on the massive iron ore deposits below the surface. She has come to London to star in a West End production of the great American classic, Long Day's Journey Into Night, Eugene O'Neill's autobiographical portrait of a family in crisis. She is playing the part of Mary Tyrone, a woman in painful decline as her family disintegrates into physical and spiritual ruin around her. One of Lange's directors once observed that she is \"drawn to grief\" like a moth to a flame. O'Neill's masterpiece is, as he writes in a tender dedication to his wife Carlotta, \"a play of old sorrow, written in tears and blood\". It is perfect Lange territory, and she admits the role was irresistible.</p> <p> \"Mary . . . Mary just breaks my heart, you know? I'm always drawn to those kind of characters. I love . . . I mean, I love the sadness in her, I love the loneliness, the fear she has.\" Why should that be? \"I think mostly because they are the areas that touch me most deeply and the ones that I'm most interested in exploring, you know? That kind of shadow. The dark side of a character.</p> <p>I mean, it's always been that way and I don't know why. It's just something that, uh, interests me more than a character that doesn't have those ghosts.\"</p> <p>Lange, who has talked in the past about suffering periods of depression, once said she thought her interest in the tragic, the sad and the lonely came from growing up in the woods of Minnesota. \"Maybe growing up there instils a sense of loneliness and despair in you and conditions the things that move you. Maybe it just comes out of the earth up there. It's something that envelops you.\" Maybe they're just better roles.</p> <p> We meet to discuss her latest venture in a small Italian restaurant behind Waterloo station. It is day five of rehearsals. She met her co-stars for the first time on Monday. She is to play opposite Charles Dance who appears as James Tyrone, Mary's flawed actor husband. So far, things are going well. \"This, for me, is the most exciting part, really,\" she says in her easy drawl. \"The kind of first encounters, and listening to the other voices and trying to figure out how it's all going to kind of mesh together. I mean, we're really just in the first process of discovery. Really hearing it and trying to figure out the thought behind everything, you know? I love that part of it. So I figure this week and the next couple of weeks will be the most thrilling in a way.\" It is a welcome return to the West End for Lange. She was last here four years ago as Blanche DuBois in Tennessee Williams' A Streetcar Named Desire, when she was given an enthusiastic reception by critics and public alike. Like Long Day's Journey Into Night, it was produced by Bill Kenwright and it restored Lange's stage reputation after a less triumphant run in the same role on Broadway in 1992, when critics commented on her \"lack of stage technique, including a voice that is not always audible\" and an \"emotional timidity\", which hardly seems credible in the context of her powerfully emotional film roles. </p> <p>Given Lange's lack of stage experience - her theatre work is limited to her very early career when she was studying acting in New York - it was a bold step to appear on Broadway, in one of the greatest plays ever written by an American. The role of Mary Tyrone is no less ambitious and there are those who are interested to see how the earthy, sexy, physically powerful Jessica Lange will fare as Mary, an ethereal, fragile character who floats in and out of the action, increasingly doped up on morphine. </p> <p>Her appearance at the Lyric Theatre is the latest in a long line of Hollywood imports to London's West End in recent years. Kathleen Turner (The Graduate), Nicole Kidman (The Blue Room), Kevin Spacey (The Ice Man Cometh) and, most recently, Daryl Hannah (The Seven Year Itch) and Macaulay Culkin (Madame Melville). It's a trend that serves a number of purposes; a big name can certainly work wonders for a show's success at the box office; equally, it can also be used to boost a flagging film career. The casting can look gimmicky, opportunistic, though not so in this case. Lange in the role of Mary Tyrone is an enticing prospect for London's theatre critics. </p> <p>She is not particularly nervous about the venture, despite her relative lack of stage experience. Does she think she's a better film actor than stage? \"I've done so much more film than theatre. I don't know,\" she says.</p> <p>\"I wouldn't know how to judge myself. I mean, after doing 22 films, you begin to understand the craft.</p> <p>\"I remember when I was working with [Jack] Nicholson years ago, I mean, it was uncanny his awareness of the camera and how everything was geared toward that, you know? I think that's what a great film actor knows how to do. Make the camera interested, make the camera want to see more. You know, really make the camera move in on you in a way, to study what it is that's going on.\"</p> <p>That surely is what Lange is so good at, too. As the murderous Cora in The Postman Always Rings Twice (1981), she and Nicholson battle it out for the camera's attention. It's a pretty close run thing. Or as the doomed actress Frances Farmer in Frances (1982); or the tragic country singer Patsy Cline in Sweet Dreams (1985). Lange seizes the camera's attention and holds on to it with both of her tough little hands, her teeth gritted with effort.</p> <p>These are among her best roles - no coincidence, perhaps, given her interest in the dark side of a character. Others have worked less well. On one of the dozens of Jessica Lange websites, a fan called Rebecca poses a conundrum familiar to anyone who has a passing interest in her work. \"Jessica Lange is my favourite actress,\" writes Rebecca, \"but she does seem to make movies that barely get seen or, if they do, are not very good.\" And there's something in that. Lange is revered as one of Hollywood's most talented and intelligent stars - but in among some truly memorable performances there have been some surprisingly poor choices. </p> <p>Lange's private life may now have settled (she is married to Pulitzer prize-winning writer, director and actor Sam Shepard), but professionally it never has, which is perhaps part of its fascination. There was Tootsie (1982), for which she won an Oscar for best supporting actress for her role as the sweeter-than-candy soap star with whom Dustin Hoffman's character falls in love. Then there was Country (1984), Sweet Dreams (1985), The Music Box (1989), Cape Fear (1991) and Blue Sky (1994), for which she won an Oscar for best actress for her role as the beleaguered military wife of Tommy Lee Jones. But along the way there have also been films ranging from the forgettable, such as Far North (1988), to the absolutely dire, such as Hush (1998). </p> <p>Jessica Lange was born in the small town of Cloquet, Minnesota, the third of four children to Al and Dorothy Lange. Al Lange was a wanderer, a drinker, a dreamer who did a variety of jobs throughout his life, everything from railroad worker to salesman, repeatedly uprooting and moving his family. He was a powerful, charismatic personality - not an easy man. His famous daughter loved him and hated him, but she always needed his approval. When she was a baby, so the story goes, he tossed her off a pier to teach her how to swim. When it came to teaching her to ride, he just put her on the back of a wild pony. </p> <p>Lange seems attracted to powerful, charismatic characters. After school, she got a scholarship to Minneapolis University to study art, where she became a hippy princess - beaded, beautiful, barefoot - but dropped out and went off to see the world with one of her teachers, a Spanish photographer and film-maker called Paco Grande, whom she married. They lived in bohemian New York, then moved to Europe, where they lived with the Gypsies in Spain, following the flamenco fairs in Seville and around Andalusia. From there they went to Amsterdam and on to Paris, where Lange studied mime and lived through the 1968 student revolution. They existed on next to nothing and travelled on a motorbike - the sort of existence most of us dream about as teenagers but few realise. </p> <p>The marriage, however, broke down. Lange returned to America, where she was signed up by Wilhemina, one of the leading model agencies of the day. She claims she was never quite tall enough or thin enough to make it on the catwalk; she did a couple of department store catalogues, but her break into films came when she was cast in the 1976 Dino de Laurentiis remake of King Kong as the ape's love interest. </p> <p>It was a disaster. Lange was lambasted and she didn't appear in a film again for three years. Her next appearance was as the angel of death in All That Jazz (1979), which was directed and choreographed by Bob Fosse, with whom she had an affair. It wasn't until 1981 that she got her big break in Bob Rafelson's The Postman Always Rings Twice, where she excelled as a duplicitous murderess. Nicholson, her co-star, idolised her. \"Few are the men who do not want to fall at the feet of Jessica Lange,\" he said. </p> <p>Her life has been as interesting off screen as on. She once said a quest for intensity had plagued her romantic life. \"It was a trap for me. As long as it was passionate - either negative or positive - then I knew it was love. As long as it was extreme. That was its validity. As soon as anything became too settled, too regular, too placid, I'd have to get in there with the Mixmaster to make sure things were still cooking.\" </p> <p>She embarked on a relationship with Russian dancer Mikhail Baryshnikov, with whom she has one daughter. Then, on the set of Frances, she met Shepard, who had a similarly colourful past and with whom she still lives. Lange is probably the better known of the two - just - but Shepard is recognised, in particular, as one of America's leading playwrights. </p> <p>Lange is notoriously reticent about their relationship as a \"movie couple\". When she picked up the best actress Oscar for Blue Sky, Shepard did not accompany her to the ceremony and she did not mention him in her acceptance speech, which provoked comment. But, as she later pointed out, award ceremonies are not his cup of tea, and her life with Shepard is separate from her professional life. Except that is, of course, when they work together. After Frances, they starred in Country and Crimes Of The Heart (1986) together. He also directed her in Far North, which he wrote, drawing on her childhood in Minnesota. She clearly enjoys working with him - they share a passion for the land and she has said that Far North and Crimes Of The Heart were among the most fun to make of all her films. </p> <p> \"As far as Sam and I are concerned, yes, we're both very private people. We just have to guard against becoming so reclusive that we end up like two old hermits living up on top of this hill,\" she was once quoted as saying.</p> <p>There does seem to be an unlikely quaintness about their relationship. Back in 1985, a journalist from the International Herald Tribune interviewing Lange described how Shepard walked in unexpectedly; Lange leaped to his side in mid-sentence as though she had not set eyes on him for weeks. She once said she had made a life-long commitment to \"taking care of Sam\". </p> <p> At 51, she is now relaxed about her career. \"I don't have a tremendous amount of ambition left.\" Was she ever that ambitious? \"Oh yeah, I think so, in the beginning. Of course, not a kind of a killer ambition by any stretch of the imagination. But I'm not looking for anything that way any more, I don't think. In the beginning, you're searching for some kind of recognition. And after a certain amount of time, that's really not important any more.\"</p> <p>Her children and family life had a dramatic impact on her career - she loathes being parted from them for any length of time. She has three children; a 19-year-old daughter, Alexandra, who is known as Shura, from her seven-year relationship with Baryshnikov; and Hannah, 14, and Walker, 13, from her relationship with Shepard. All of them will be coming to London to spend varying amounts of time with her while she's doing the play. </p> <p>They will be tutored while they are here, and they will grumble and moan that they are having to leave behind their friends and their lives back home in Minnesota, but Lange has always made sure her children spend plenty of time with her when she's away on location - not just for them. When they were smaller, she says she used to be able to just pack them up and bring them away and they were barely aware of where they were. It was much easier. Now they'd prefer to be left at home, but she can't do it. Why not? \"Because I don't do well without them.\" </p> <p>Ask her what it feels like to be without them and she pauses for a second, then says: \"You know what it feels like? It feels like the end of the world. They're the only thing I think in my life that ever really anchored me, that I've ever felt cemented to. And I just enjoy them more than anyone else in the world. And I'd rather hang out with them than anyone else. I'd rather be with them than with anyone else. I find them infinitely fascinating.\" </p> <p> Lange is refreshingly independent of Hollywood. She has spoken out occasionally - challenging the absurd sums the big stars command for each performance. She has said she would never have plastic surgery - even if she did add that Sam would not approve. She's physically separate from the place - as well as ideologically - never having lived there.</p> <p>Until 1995 she lived in Charlottesville, Virginia, on a farm where Shepard bred horses and raised cattle. Then, when her widowed mother's health began to fail, she took her family back to Minnesota, so that they could grow up amid a network of cousins and second cousins, brothers and sisters, uncles, aunts, great uncles and great aunts. She wanted her children to feel haunted by a place, the way she was as a child, with a powerful sense of belonging. She once said that she would like her gravestone to be inscribed with just one word, \"Mother\".</p> <p>Seven years ago, she was one of a group who travelled to Romania to try to help free children from the nightmarish institutions of the Ceausescu regime. She brought back two children - a boy and a girl. The boy went to live with one family, the little girl stayed with Lange. When she arrived, they thought she was about two years old. It turned out she was in fact six but her muscles had atrophied to such a degree that she had not grown. She had never walked; she had never talked. \"There was this thrilling moment when she started to walk. She got strong and she got healthy,\" says Lange. She never, sadly, learned to talk.</p> <p>After 18 months the girl went to live with the family who were bringing up the Romanian boy brought out of the country at the same time. \"It was not a question of adopting her, it was a question of getting her out and finding her a home and getting her healthy before she went to live with these people. If I had the kind of stability, I would have loved to bring these children up. It was very difficult because of the way I work. I'm always travelling. I'm always going on location. These kids really needed a place where they were just at home. They had never had that.\" </p> <p>Currently, her key preoccupation is the American elections. She is watching the presidential race anxiously from afar. Before coming to London she was heavily involved in campaigning for the Democrats - because the alternative, she believes, would be so disastrous for her country, particularly on abortion rights. Bush is pro-life.</p> <p>She's also concerned about the environment. Bush's record on environmental policies in Texas, where he is governor, she says, are some of the worst in the entire country. \"We are going backward in that country at such an alarming rate, it's really scary. We have this incredible kind of, um, conservative right-wing movement, and if Bush gets elected, it's going to move so far right. I told my kids, 'Look, if Bush is elected, think of where you wanna go. [She laughs - a really funny, infectious laugh.] We'll be leaving for four years.\"</p> <p>Seriously? \"Nooooo, I can't drag my kids out of the country just because I hate the president, although I would be tempted. [She laughs again.] You know, to see his smirking little face on TV every night, and to listen to him - he's such a stupid man. </p> <p>\"They're saying this is the closest election in something like, what, 40 years? That's what's so frightening. You look at the people around you and you think, 'My God, what are you thinking about? There is no contest here. What are you thinking about?'\"</p> <p>She thinks Clinton has been \"a very successful president\", but adds, \"For a man who is so amazingly intelligent, he really has done some extraordinary things. Sometimes you just have to shake your head and think, how could he be so fucking stupid, you know? How could he have blown it like this? The whole scandals! We've been continually hounded by these scandals for the last eight years.\"</p> <p>Lange is more engaged politically than I anticipated. Hollywood has a long and enduring relationship with politics - Warren Beatty, Ronald Reagan, Clint Eastwood, Jane Fonda - but Lange is less known as an activist; someone who is private, cut off, busy living out a rural idyll, doing a bit of photography, \"taking care\" of Sam. We talk about the excitement of 1968 and I ask her what she thinks about the anti-globalism protests which have recently taken place in Prague and, before that, in Seattle. \"It interests me a great deal. I mean, I think it's very dangerous to have the World Trade Organisation making decisions. It's hard enough for people to actually get the government to do what they want. But to have something that's so outside any kind of rules and checks. That I think is very frightening.\" </p> <p> She says she was much more political in the 60s, when an entire generation was galvanised into political action by the Vietnam War, but every once in a while it rears its head again. Like when she, Sissy Spacek and Jane Fonda travelled to Washington to give evidence before something called the House Democratic Caucus Task Force on Agriculture in order to highlight the plight of farmers being driven off the land. News reports from the time document that Fonda was the most professional, Spacek the most impassioned and Lange the most heartfelt. </p> <p>It is an issue about which Lange feels particularly strongly because of her own upbringing amid farmers in Minnesota. She cares about the land and those who work on it and you can see it in her work, most evidently in Country, which she produced and in which she plays a farmer's wife struggling to hold farm and family together in the face of ruinous Reaganite policies. It's there in A Thousand Acres (1997), a reworking of King Lear in which a father seeks to divide his farmland among his daughters. There's a campaigning edge to some of her work, which isn't instantly obvious.</p> <p>Would she call herself a feminist? \"No, I would never say that. No, I would never use that term. I've always done what I've wanted. I've never felt anything has stood in my way. I think I've raised my daughters that same way, that they are capable of doing anything they could possibly ever imagine.\" </p> <p>After Long Day's Journey, Lange's next leap into the dark comes when she directs for the first time. She first optioned the novel Machine Dreams, by Jayne Anne Phillips, 15 years ago, and after leaving it gathering dust for years, she returned to it last winter and wrote a draft script. \"The writing was very enjoyable,\" she says. \"There are very few things in my life which I do privately. You know what I mean? Where you are actually alone in a room and it's just you. It was very meditative, very peaceful. It was wonderful to sit on winter afternoons and try to adapt this book.\" </p> <p>Did she feel at all intimidated, tiptoeing as she was into Shepard's territory as writer? \"No, actually,\" she says breezily. \"It didn't intimidate me while I was doing it at all. When I gave him the script to read, I think I hovered nervously around the stairwell to see how he was going to react,\" she says. \"But he was really great about it.\"</p> <p>Writing is not something she finds particularly easy. \"I don't have the discipline to do it. I really don't. I have a hard time just settling in one spot for more than a few moments at a time.\" Directing, however, is another matter. She is very excited about directing. Kathy Bates and Robin Wright have already expressed an interest in the project and once she has got her next film out of the way (she is starring with Christina Ricci in Elizabeth Wurtzel's Prozac Nation) she'll move to the other side of the camera. \"I'm going to ask everybody I've ever known who's directed anything at all - even traffic - I'm going to ask them how it's done, you know? I have no ego when it comes to that. I want everybody's, everybody's information.\" </p> <p>Heartfelt. Yes, that's it. Lange is someone whose politics, like her career and her private life, is heartfelt. She's driven by her heart and by her emotions; she's constantly getting out the Mixmaster to make sure things are still cooking. Which doesn't always make for sensible decisions, but it does make her daring, and a bit dangerous and at times dazzling. She might bomb, she might be brilliant, but at least she doesn't play it safe</p> <p>Long Day's Journey Into Night will be previewing at the Lyric Theatre, London, from November 6 and runs until March 3.</p>",
  "<p>Attempts by the embattled European Central Bank to push up the value of the euro were brushed aside by the foreign exchange markets as two separate bouts of intervention failed to boost the currency. </p> <p>In a surprise move the ECB announced that it had taken unilateral action to sell US dollars and Japanese yen in order to prevent the weakness of the euro feeding through into higher inflation. Dealers estimated that the countries of the euro zone spent around $3bn on the operation. </p> <p>Although the imminence of the US presidental election ruled out participation by the Federal Reserve in the second attempt to prop up the euro in six weeks, the ECB timed its first move to come just hours before the publication of jobs data from the US pointing to a marked slowdown. </p> <p>Figures from the US labour department showed that non-farm payrolls increased by 137,000 - well down on the 185,000 increase predicted by market analysts, who had expected demand for workers to be stronger as companies prepared for the Thanksgiving and Christmas celebrations. </p> <p>Although the ECB clearly hoped to catch the dollar at a weak moment, early gains were quickly reversed. </p> <p>Evidence that the long US boom might be coming to an end was shrugged off by dealers, forcing the ECB into a second foray into the markets during the afternoon. </p> <p>By the end of the day in London, the euro was trading at around 86.40 cents, the level at which the ECB first stepped in but well down on its intra-day peak of just under 88 cents. </p> <p>The move came some six weeks after the ECB - in concert with the Federal Reserve as well as other G7 central banks including the Bank of England - sought to a defend the euro, which has lost almost 30% of its value against the dollar since its launch at the beginning of last year. </p> <p>At an ECB conference of central bankers and academics on price stability, held yesterday in Frankfurt, board member Ottmar Issing said the bank had decided to intervene \"owing to its concern about the global and domestic repercussions of the exchange rate of the euro, including its impact on price stability\". </p> <p>\"The ECB confirms its view that the external value of the euro does not reflect the favourable conditions of the euro area.\" </p> <p>The ECB is concerned that the falling value of the euro is exacerbating the impact of higher oil prices, pushing inflation in euroland above the central bank's 2% ceiling. </p> <p>Mr Issing added that the action had been unilateral. \"We have not invited the authorities of other currencies to join the intervention.\" </p> <p>Other G7 central banks had been informed of the ECB's plans in advance, he said, and the move should be seen as a continuation of the coordinated action on September 22. </p> <p>Nick Parsons, a currency analyst at Commerzbank in London, said the intervention had been \"brilliantly timed and well executed\". </p> <p>\"The intervention in September was defensive, the intervention today was aggressive.The ECB is showing that it can play with the big boys, that it is one of the big boys.\" </p> <p>But others, such as Michael Klawitter at investment bank WestLB, were unimpressed. \"I have strong doubts whether it will work. They will be forced to step in several times again just to defend the [current] level,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>Rupert Murdoch yesterday denied that the $40bn (\u00a328bn) flotation of News Corporation's satellite television assets, including its stake in BSkyB, had run into trouble. </p> <p>Mr Murdoch said the flotation was still on the cards and could even press ahead by the end of the year. </p> <p>But the exact timing of the listing for Sky Global Networks would depend on a number of factors including market conditions, he added. </p> <p>\"It will happen either in the last part of the year or the first month of next year,\" said Mr Murdoch, at the BSkyB annual general meeting. </p> <p>\"It depends on market conditions, and there's a lot of 'moving parts' we can't really talk about right now.\" </p> <p>The \"moving parts\" were interpreted to be negotiations with potential investors in the business including Microsoft. The software firm is understood to be negotiating a stake worth up to $1bn. </p> <p>Web portal Yahoo! and mobile phone manufacturer Nokia have also been named as potential partners. </p> <p>Matters have been further complicated by the French media group Vivendi's forced disposal of its BSkyB stakeholding for clearance to acquire the Universal film and music business. It is not clear whether regulators will allow Vivendi to fold its stake into Sky Global. </p> <p>BSkyB said its target of 5m subscribers was now within reach, putting the pay television group two months ahead of its end of 2000 deadline. </p> <p>Signing up new customers, however, came at a price. The company's extra marketing spend and the rising cost of programming resulted in pre-tax losses of \u00a3123m for the third quarter. The figure compares with losses of \u00a313.6m for the same period in 1999. </p> <p>BSkyB chief executive Tony Ball said the company remained on course for its 7m subscriber target by 2003. By the end of last week the business had signed up 4.95m. </p> <p>\"We'll finish the year north of 5m and we still expect to switch off our analogue signal in June 2001,\" he said. Of its subscribers, some 4.1m are on the digital platform. </p> <p>These encouraging figures prompted shares in the company to climb 47p to \u00a310.51. </p> <p>Revenues during the three-month period increased by 33% to \u00a3520m.</p>",
  "Olivier Bancoult, cleared from his Indian Ocean home by the British government 32 years ago, dropped to his knees and kissed the ground when he returned this June. Mr Bancoult, who was only four when he left, was in tears, as were two older islanders accompanying him: \"After not being able to see the motherland for so long, it was something very emotional.\" <p>Mr Bancoult and his companions were allowed three days on the islands to gather material for yesterday's successful legal challenge to the Foreign Office. He was hugged by fellow islanders outside the high court in London after winning the right to return home. </p> <p>Their return - or at least adequate compensation - would bring an end to a shameful episode in British and US history in which both governments tricked the islanders out of their homes to make way for a US military base. The numbers involved are small - anywhere between 400 and 4,000 islanders might want to go home - but the issues raised are not. </p> <p>The episode highlights the ease with which politicians and diplomats in Britain and the US lied; their determination to keep their duplicity hidden from parliament, Congress and the UN; the extent to which the US dictates British foreign policy; and, above all else, how two powers abused the trust of the islanders. </p> <p>The behaviour of the governments is laid bare in hundreds of pages of correspondence, never published before and almost all of it marked secret. Many were unearthed by the Guardian in the Public Records Office at Kew, others were presented as evidence in court. </p> <p><b> Unwelcome questions</b><br> </p> <p> One of them, an internal Foreign Office memo in 1980, recommended to the then foreign secretary, Douglas Hurd, that \"no journalists should be allowed to visit Diego Garcia\" and that visits by parliamentarians or congressmen be kept to an absolute minimum in order to keep out those \"who deliberately stir up unwelcome questions\". </p> <p>The US first took an interest in 1962 in the Chagos islands, a beautiful archipelago of 65 islands that includes Diego Garcia, Penhos Banhos and Saloman, halfway between Africa and India. The US, fixated on the communist threat at the height of the cold war, was alarmed by a Chinese attack on India that year and wanted to plug the gap in its strategic deployment as it had no base between the Mediterranean and the Philippines. </p> <p>Britain and the US entered into secret negotiations in 1964. The Chagos islands were - and continue to be - part of Britain's dwindling empire. Under the deal, Britain would lease Diego Garcia to the US to use as a base. The US wanted not only Diego Garcia but the surrounding islands free of people for security reasons. The only problem was that there were people on them. Britain agreed. A Foreign Office memo, marked secret, written by P. B. Porter of the East Africa department on February 13, 1969, disclosed that at a Whitehall meeting the Treasury representative \"greatly preferred the ideal of a complete sterilisation of the islands.\" </p> <p>How to achieve this? British civil servants hit on the solution of denying that the islanders were permanent residents and insisting they were temporary contract workers, employed on the copra plantations. This was the line that both the British and US governments were to maintain for years, even though they knew it was untrue. One Whitehall document, dated January 1970, is even subtitled Maintaining the Fiction. </p> <p>Some of those working on the islands were, as Britain and the US insisted, temporary residents, brought in from Mauritius and the Seychelles to work on the copra plantations. But about 400, as the British government disclosed in memos but not in public, had lived on the islands for at least two generations. </p> <p>Britain and the US were worried that if this emerged, they would be in trouble with the UN. Instead, they hit on the ruse of categorising them as \"transient\" workers with no rights of residence and had them shipped to Mauritius, even though internal memos admitted it was an unsuitable cultural and economic environment. Britain paid Mauritius \u00a3650,000 to help them settle. </p> <p>The Labour MP, Tam Dalyell, then as now a nuisance to government, had been tabling questions. The Foreign Office, in a memo distributed round Whitehall on November 13, 1970, said: \"We would not wish it to become general knowledge that some of the inhabitants have lived on Diego Garcia for at least two generations and could, therefore, be regarded as 'belongers'. The memo, written by E. J. Emery of the Foreign Office's Pacific and Indian Ocean department, added: \"We shall, therefore, advise ministers in handling supplementary questions about whether Diego Garcia is inhabited to say that there is only a small number of contract labourers from the Seychelles and Mauritius engaged to work on the copra plantations on the island.\" </p> <p>Detailed guidance notes were issued to Foreign Office and Ministry of Defence press officers telling them to mislead the media if asked. </p> <p>Why did British governments go to such trouble? The obvious reason was that both governments would have faced public outcry if it had come out at the time and would have been in contravention of UN treaties respecting the rights of indigenous people. </p> <p>But there were further implications. Foreign Office documents marked \"top secret\" reveal that, in return for granting the US the base, Washington waived \u00a35m Britain owed to the US for the Polaris nuclear missile. The deal was signed by the Labour foreign secretary, George Brown. </p> <p>The US initially asked for the deal to be kept secret and the then Labour prime minister, Harold Wilson, complied, lying in public. </p> <p>On April 18, 1967, C.H. Henn, sent a memo from the Foreign Office to the US government: \"Ultimately, under extreme pressure, we should have to deny the existence of a US contribution in any form, and to advise ministers to do so in [parliament] if necessary. Clearly, we should do more confidently if you could confirm that the US would take a similar line under pressure.\" </p> <p><b> Financial agreement</b><br> </p> <p> But the US began to wobble. A Foreign Office memo to the British embassy in Washington on June 2 1967, advised the British ambassador to Washington in 1976 to stress personally to the US secretary of state, Dean Rusk, that \"if the Americans, under pressure, reveal the existence of the financial agreement, then we should be in acute parliamentary and constitutional difficulties.\" </p> <p>Politicians and diplomats will go to extraordinary lengths to explain away their lies. Michael Stewart, then Labour foreign secretary, wrote in a memo on April 21 1969: \"The Americans did not make a direct contribution: we have merely paid less than we would have otherwise ... there is thus no question of the House of Commons having been misled.\" </p> <p>Every government since the 1960s has connived in this injustice. The foreign secretary, Robin Cook, supported the cause of the islanders in opposition but his position now is unclear. The Foreign Office yesterday distanced itself from the events of 30 years ago but it is the same Foreign Office that fought the islanders in court.</p>",
  "<p>Until Thursday, when her house in Shrewsbury was flooded for the first time in 60 years, Denise Jones had barely considered global warming as a scientific theory, let alone a reality. </p> <p>\"I know my kids and Friends of the Earth go on about it but I thought it just meant nice warm summers and I was quite in favour. I didn't know it meant floods and storms and what we have got now,\" she said, craning to hear Tony Blair who was visiting the drowning Shropshire town. </p> <p>Mrs Jones's new understanding of climate change follows a series of ever stronger statements in the past 10 days from government and opposition, the environment agency and green groups, all of whom have been quick to give the public a geography lesson and link extreme weather in Britain with lifestyle and global change. </p> <p>The need to prepare people for climate change may be as much fuelled by political expediency - the weather is seen by some as fortuitously deflecting attention from the fuel and transport crises - as by alarming new UN and EU reports in the last 10 days. </p> <p>The most worrying leaked out from the UN-sponsored intergovernmental panel on climate change, a grouping of 200 of the world's leading climatologists. </p> <p>In their first big report in five years they linked the warming climate of the last 20 years with man made carbon emissions, and predicted rapidly accelerating global warming with increasingly severe weather. </p> <p>A European commission report warned of a more extreme, stormier world. It specifically said Britain would have mild winters with rain in very heavy bursts, but with hot summers and droughts, too. </p> <p>The reports confirmed government studies which say that flooding is now twice as frequent as 100 years ago and that we can expect to see a tenfold increase in flood risk over the next century. </p> <p>\"There have been floods somewhere every month in Britain for the last 32 months. Up to 5m people live in flood risk areas in England where there are 1.8m properties valued at over \u00a3200bn,\" said Geoff Spence, the agency's director of water management. </p> <p>New policy guidance will be published next month on developments on flood plains, giving planners authority to decide what should and should not be allowed. </p> <p>The government estimates global warming could mean spending an extra \u00a312bn on flood defences in the next 50 years, but has only committed an extra \u00a330m. </p> <p>Yesterday, the environment agency said: \"We argued for an extra \u00a3100m. There has been under-investment in the past.\" </p> <p>How flood money is spent is likely to be the subject of debate between ecologists and engineers in government. Traditionally, the Ministry of Agriculture has favoured big sea defences, big engineering and more field drainage. This is criticised for increasing the run off from fields and pushing water downstream where it can flood communities. The environment agency and the Department of the Environment are moving to a more sensitive, holistic approach. </p> <p>Yesterday John Boardman, head of the environmental change unit at Oxford University, played down the influence of global warming, saying the recent floods were caused largely by farm practices. \"People are being flooded because of how we farm,\" he said. </p> <p>Extensive cultivation of winter wheat sewn in September leaves the land bare in the wettest parts of the year, together with overstocking of sheep on the uplands which leads to erosion, is the cause of much flooding, he added. </p> <p>Mr Spence said: \"The run off of water from bare fields is 10-100 times greater than from a field with grass. It has led to increased property damage. </p> <p>\"Since the war the drainage system has been geared to get water off the fields faster. Because of the switch to winter cereals we have lost the big rough plough furrows that used to collect the water. We should be trying to keep water in the catchment areas, treating the cause of floods rather than the symptoms.\" </p> <p>He would like to see the development of \"porous cities\", where pavements soak in water, drains run into tanks and water is prevented from immediately running into rivers. </p> <p>Ecologist Chris Baines, who has worked with Mr Meacher and farm minister Elliot Morley on the rural white paper, said: \"We should consider blocking the drains in upland moors to let the peat bogs saturate again: These giant sponges regulate the run-off, but they also slow the rate of climate change.\"</p>",
  "Plans for a quarry on the Isle of Harris in the Western Isles, to provide rock for road building in the south of England, have been turned down by Scottish ministers after a 15 year planning battle. <p>The Scottish environment minister, Sam Galbraith, overruled the recommendation of the planning inquiry and said the need for stone in England should not override the need to protect Scottish areas of natural heritage. </p> <p>Kevin Dunnion, director of Friends of the Earth Scotland, which has led the campaign to save Harris from the French quarry company Lafarge Redland Aggregates, said he was delighted the environment had won. </p> <p>A planning application was lodged in 1991 to replace the mountain of Roineabhal at Lingerbay in the south of Harris with a sea loch. The developers would annually extract about 10m tonnes of a hard rock, anorthosite. A port would be constructed to export the stone to England and the continent. </p> <p>In Harris opinion was divided but a coastal quarry supporters network was formed. They believed the quarry would provide work and arrest the loss of young people to the mainland. </p> <p>Opponents argued that the noise, dust and environmental damage could jeopardise jobs in tourism and aquaculture, which rely on the island's pristine image. </p> <p>Even though the planning reporter thought the need for the quarry overrode environmental and scenic objections she said: \"The detrimental effect on the environment must be re garded as very significant. The quarry would create an area of massive disturbance, involving man made industrial features, heavy plant, and disruptive noise. Unless there are overriding reasons relating to national benefit, the acceptance of such an intrusive feature within such an important landscape would set a precedent that would undermine the continued successful operation of policy for national scenic areas.\" </p> <p>She concluded that there was overriding national benefit, but ministers disagreed. They said the bene fit was to England and not Scotland. </p> <p>The decision emphasises that the interests of Scotland must be put before English planning priorities. Ministers said yesterday that English planning guidance should not be taken into account. </p> <p>\"Ministers accept that the development could bring substantial benefits to the local community through the creation of 200 jobs. However, they take the view that the reporter has seriously underestimated the impact of the proposed development on the na tional scenic area.\" Mr Dunnion said \"There are those who believe the development should be allowed because jobs are more important than anything else, but recent successes of bringing jobs in fish processing and cultural tourism show there are alternatives. </p> <p>\"Time has shown the need for aggregates has fallen and no longer requires imports from Scotland. It would have been a cruel illusion to have permitted the quarry on the promise of jobs that would not materialise.\"</p>",
  "<p>Britain faces another battering from the elements tomorrow as a deep depression is expected to sweep in from the Atlantic bringing heavy rain and gales. </p> <p>Towns and cities in England and Wales recovering from the floods risk being deluged again, the environment agency warned last night, although today is expected to be mostly dry. </p> <p>The storm will rage on through Monday and Tuesday as it sweeps across the the country with rainfall of between one and two inches. </p> <p>Met office spokesman Colin Donnelly said: \"There is going to be another bout of gale-force winds and some heavy falls of rain, coming in to the south-west about Sunday lunchtime and gradually transferring across the rest of the country. </p> <p>\"We are looking at gales and severe gale force winds across exposed areas, as the system moves west to east across the country.\" </p> <p>Areas where severe flood warnings are in force will be \"highly vulnerable\" once again after a brief respite while calmer conditions prevail today. </p> <p>Scotland and Northern Ireland are at lower risk from the severe weather than the rest of Britain. </p> <p>An environment agency spokesman said: \"People should maintain their vigilance. People who have not yet evacuated from areas where there are severe flood warnings should prepare themselves for evacuation.\" </p> <p>The agency issued severe flood warnings on 13 areas in Britain and Wales, across seven rivers. On the River Severn, severe flood warnings remained in force last night from Bewdley through Tewkesbury to Gloucester. A further 167 flood warnings and more than 100 flood watches remain in force. Many parts of Worcestershire and Shrewsbury are already feet under water. Thousands of homes have been swamped across Britain with floods on the same scale as those in 1947, said the environment agency. </p> <p>The waters peaked at Worcester, where the racecourse and cricket ground were flooded, but it will be several days before the level drops significantly. Downstream of Worcester, levels were slowly rising. The environment agency blamed inadequate drainage systems for house floodings in Yorkshire, notably in York and Whitby. </p> <p>The deputy prime minister, John Prescott, met flood defence workers yesterday when he called at the Tewkesbury base of the environment agency, where he was briefed for 40 minutes on the systems in place to deal with the crisis. </p> <p>The floods have been seized upon with delight by some watersports enthusiasts who have enjoyed canoeing and even surfing over what is usu ally dry land. But the emergency services are warning of submerged hazards such as bike-stands and kerbstones and are urging the public not to take risks. </p> <p>A suspected shoplifter who was feared to have been swept to his death in a swollen river was yesterday named as Nigel McCallion, 21, of Kings Norton, Birmingham. </p> <p>His body has yet to be found after he plunged into the fast-flowing waters of the River Tame in Birmingham. </p> <p>He either jumped or fell in after he was pursued by a security guard from a shopping centre. A widespread search of the river involved a police helicopter. </p> <p>Hundreds of bonfire night celebrations have been cancelled. </p> <p>Police are urging visitors to stay away from tonight's famous bonfire celebrations in Lewes, East Sussex, in which effigies of the Pope are traditionally burned. </p> <p>The town has not recovered from the devastating effects of recent flooding and cannot cope with a surge of daytrippers, who often swell the population by up to 50,000. </p> <p>The townspeople will still celebrate a scaled-down version of the festivities, but at least one of the bonfires has had to be scrapped because its pitch is sodden. </p> <p>Another outlandish bonfire tradition dampened by the weather is the centuries old \"burning barrel\" race in Ottery St Mary, Devon. </p> <p>As in Lewes, outside spectators have been asked not to swell the crowd watching runners carrying flaming tar-lined barrels.</p>",
  "The chairman and entire board of Scotland's education authority resigned yesterday as a report damned its performance during this summer's exams fiasco. <p>The clear-out of the Scottish qualifications authority was ordered by the country's education minister, Jack McConnell, after the report detailed a string of management failures which led to thousands of Scottish students being sent incomplete or inaccurate results. </p> <p>Mr McConnell accepted the resignation of the SQA's chairman, David Miller, but he was yesterday taking legal advice on the minimum number of members required for the board before deciding on how many of its other 23 members should go. </p> <p>The independent report is severely critical of the performance of the SQA, but it did not look at the actions of ministers. A Scottish parliamentary committee will give its assessment of Mr McConnell's predecessor, Sam Galbraith - who has been moved to environment - later this year. </p> <p>Mr McConnell said: \"The report by Deloitte &amp; Touche paints a stark picture of an organisation with significant management weaknesses, where poor strategic and operational planning led to a data management crisis from which it could not recover in time.\" </p> <p>At the height of the fiasco, Scotland's education system appeared to be in crisis. Students were disadvantaged in applying for university places, schools claimed marking was anomalous and, as the full scale of the problem emerged, ministers said they had been kept in the dark. </p> <p>The report reveals that SQA managers failed to deploy resources properly and did not recruit enough exam markers. It also says that staff were not trained correctly and problems were not reported to the Scottish executive. </p> <p>No single problem was said to be at the root of the SQA's poor performance and, although \"data handling issues\" were a critical flaw, they were far from being the body's only deficiency. The report said: \"Rather, there were weaknesses and difficulties in a number of interlinked management, process and information systems areas which cumulatively overwhelmed the delivery [of the examinations results].\" </p> <p>Mike Russell, the Scottish National party's education spokesman, said the report revealed a complete breakdown in the board's duty of care. \"It is worthy of comment that it has taken a change of minister to produce the long overdue removal of those at the top,\" he added. </p> <p>The SQA's chief executive, Ron Tuck, resigned soon after the crisis broke and two other senior figures have since left the organisation. Mr McConnell would not rule out further departures yesterday, but he said that was a matter for the interim chief executive, Bill Morton. </p> <p>\"The remit I have given him is that his job is to put in place the systems, the people and the organisation that can deliver,\" said Mr McConnell. </p> <p>\"He can step on any toes he wants anywhere in Scotland to deliver that and he will have my backing.\"</p>",
  "<p>This week Napster, the upstart online music-swapping service, announced that it has joined forces with Bertelsmann, one of the world's leading music and entertainment companies, to create a global \"membership based service\" for downloading music. Bertelsmann, in turn, has agreed to drop its lawsuit charging Napster with illegally distributing copyrighted music via the internet. Other music companies involved in the landmark litigation have not yet decided whether they will withdraw in the wake of this development. </p> <p>The Napster decision represents a turning point for dot.com commerce. What we're witnessing is the beginning of a struggle between two great economic systems. On one side of the divide lies the old market-based economy, made up of sellers and buyers. On the other lies the new network-based economy, made up of servers and clients. In markets, the parties exchange property. In networks, they share access to services and experiences. </p> <p>The new information and telecommunications technologies, e-commerce and globalisation are facilitating a new economic era. By the middle of the 21st century, markets, the hallmark of conventional capitalism, will have largely disappeared, replaced by a system based on network relationships, contractual arrangements and access rights. </p> <p>Napster is the first of a new genre of businesses that operate by a network mentality rather than by market logic. And it is the Napster model which is likely to set the pace for the way companies in every field do business. </p> <p>There are a number of reasons for this. First, the near warp-speed of distribution and exchange on the web makes direct market-based transactions too slow. With a simple click, one can distribute music around the world and exchange whole libraries of songs before a cash register can even ring up a sale. </p> <p>Second, web distribution reduces transaction costs toward zero, virtually eliminating the traditional profit margins on sales-related activity. Compare the transaction costs of producing, packaging, inventorying, transporting and merchandising a CD with the cost of producing a single music track and distributing it instantaneously to millions of people, at no appreciable additional cost. </p> <p>Third, in markets, the emphasis is on maximising production and profit is made on the volume of the sales. In networks the emphasis is on minimising production and profit is made by pooling risks and sharing savings. Everyone in the Napster network swaps music with each other. But because the music has been reconfigured digitally as pure information, it can be shared without any loss to the holder. </p> <p>So how do companies like Napster make money? They build up their network of users by providing a free service. Then, they transform their main asset, their network of millions of users, into paid subscribers or members. That's what the Napster-Bertelsmann deal is all about. Napster is proposing to charge a monthly fee of $4.95 to secure unlimited access to the Bertelsmann music catalogue. </p> <p>Already, EMI Recorded Music, the Universal Music Group, and Sony Music Entertainment have announced similar plans. A Jupiter Communications study projects that by 2005, online subscriptions for music will account for $980m in revenue, while individual market-based transactions of CDs online will account for less than $531m. </p> <p>Finally, sophisticated new technologies allow for a perpetual flow of feedback activity, turning the economy from \"discrete\" market transactions to continuous non-stop access in networks. One pays to be always connected to a steady stream of virtually unlimited music rather than to buy an occasional CD. Commercial life is non-stop now. </p> <p>Napster is only the tip of the iceberg. The film industry is locked into a similar court battle with hackers who have created a code that cracks the digital video disk format, allowing anyone who has access to the code to make copies of DVD movies and exchange them free of charge. </p> <p>More than 300,000 movie downloads are taking place each day and observers expect the number of downloads to reach a million or more copies per day by the end of the year. There may be little the film industry can do to stem the tide. In the long run, film companies are likely to follow the lead of the music industry and make their peace with the net by setting up their own sites and providing access to films by turning users into paid subscribers and members. </p> <p>While there has been a great deal of angst over how to protect copyright, little attention has been paid to where the whole network process and access relationships is leading society. Short-term access between servers and clients operating in networks is going to redefine our social dynamics. Today, the Napster- Bertelsmann way of doing business is an oddity. In the future, it will be the norm. </p> <p>Jeremy Rifkin is the author of The Age of Access: How the Shift From Ownership to Access is Transforming Capitalism (Penguin Books, 2000)</p>",
  "Go, Al, go! The Democratic candidate is America's only sensible presidential choice next Tuesday. Despite his troubled campaign, Mr Gore has shown that he is a man who knows his business, has thought carefully about the issues and has the discipline, maturity and character required for the job. <p>His Republican opponent, George W Bush, has proved exactly the opposite. While likeable, even charming in a puppy-dog sort of way, the Texan governor's lack of top-flight experience, his vagueness and unfamiliarity with policy complexities and his evident intellectual laziness have become apparent to all. Neither man has articulated a startlingly different or inspirational vision for America at home. Both have set up their stalls on the crowded political centre ground, Mr Bush with his declared allegiance - somewhat at odds with his record - to \"compassionate conservatism\", Mr Gore with his vow to fight for middle America. Ideology is absent in new millennium America. There are, even so, decisive differences between their claims to the job. For his competence, his commitment and his genuine concern, Mr Gore is the man we hope the voters will pick. </p> <p>On the domestic front, Mr Gore is preferable for numerous reasons. Unlike Mr Bush, he will protect a woman's right to abortion and is clearly determined to uphold the legal rights of minority and disadvantaged citizens. Unlike Mr Bush, the Democrat will try to persuade Congress to enact tougher gun-control laws. When it comes to the key issues of social security provision, prescription medicines and health insurance for young and old alike, Mr Gore's proposals are both more equitable and workable than his opponent's. The Democrat acknowledges that campaign finance reform is essential if America's democracy is not to be further debased; yet despite the strong case for such reform made by John McCain, his main party rival, Mr Bush does not. Mr Gore acknowledges the need for more effective workplace regulation and tougher environmental standards; Mr Bush, the complete corporate candidate, does not. Mr Gore firmly believes that there is a legitimate role for government in a free market society, lest capitalism's excesses overwhelm the less fortunate; Mr Bush does not really. The Democrat refuses to squander the record budget surplus on massive, regressive tax cuts, preferring instead to invest some of that money in education, public services and debt reduction. Mr Bush, at his most irresponsible on this question, espouses reckless, inflationary tax giveaways that could stop the American economic miracle in its tracks and ultimately trigger a worldwide recession. </p> <p>In terms of foreign policy, Mr Bush (to the uncertain extent that he understands the issues at all) is the embodiment of all that is negative and ugly in post-cold war American thinking. He is the child of rightwing congressional and thinktank unilateralists, or neo-isolationists, who undermine the UN, ridicule concepts of nation-building, cut the foreign aid budget, wage trade wars and block or emasculate international treaties. Like them, Mr Bush supports US military disengagement in the Balkans and perhaps elsewhere, persists in regarding China and Russia as potential enemies, believes it right to besiege and bully out-of-favour countries with sanctions and threats, and complains that European allies are not pulling their weight. Yet like the hawks, the Republican simultaneously undermines Nato and global arms control by insisting on a national missile defence system for Fortress America. </p> <p>Mr Bush seems to know little, and care less, about non-military global threats like climate change, desertification, Aids, population growth and developing world poverty, debt and educational under-attainment. His is the exceptionalist mentality of the America Firster who views the outside world as strange and threatening. While this is hardly surprising in a man who has travelled beyond the US on only three occasions in his adult life (excluding visits to Mexico), it is hardly acceptable in a man who aspires to world leadership. His worst know-nothing instincts would probably be tempered by more seasoned advisers. But his is a strikingly narrower outlook than that of Mr Gore who, while hardly faultless on these many issues, would at least try to to maintain the limited, albeit self-serving, internationalism of the Clinton years. </p> <p>The manner in which this year's presidential campaign has been fought leaves much to be desired. Too often it has appeared as a mere beauty contest between two not particularly beautiful men. More than ever before, money, the media and pollsters have set the agenda, particularly through TV ads and chat shows that emphasised the personal and the trivial over the substantive and serious. One consequence is likely to be another disappointing voter turnout, at around 50%. The televised debates would have been more illuminating had the Green party candidate, Ralph Nader, been allowed to participate. Despite this, Mr Nader has waged a valuable and stimulating campaign. The Democrats would do well to give careful consideration to some of his proposed reforms. </p> <p>But after all is said and done, the marginalised Mr Nader cannot win and the lightweight Mr Bush should not be allowed to. When Joseph Lieberman, Mr Gore's running mate, said the Texas governor was not yet ready for the presidency, he was too kind. On this year's showing, Mr Bush is unlikely ever to be worthy of the job. Mr Gore, in contrast, the son of a Tennessee politician, a long-time senator, and vice-president for eight years, is tailor-made for it. It is true he sometimes seems doomed to be the ultimate man in a suit. Exciting he ain't. A visionary he is not. But he is the safe, wise choice - for them and us. So, on Tuesday: Go, Al, go!</p>",

  "<p>Up to 3,000 homes were being evacuated in the city of York last night as flood waters threatened to reach their highest level for more than 100 years. </p> <p>Flood defences were breached after torrential rain swelled the river Ouse, which is expected to rise to 5 metres above normal today. </p> <p>After an attempt to barricade city streets with sand bags, the army moved in to help when it became evident that thousands of homes were in danger of being swamped. </p> <p>As many as 6,000 people were expected to be moved out overnight and taken into makeshift evacuation centres. </p> <p>The deputy prime minister, John Prescott, donned waders to visit flooded homes in north Yorkshire. \"I know how these people feel now, they are in such difficult circumstances.

  "Stymie had killed Lizard so there was a \"green light\" - the term for a go-ahead for a revenge killing - shining on the Temple Street gang when it met that night. But now a different kind of light is being shone on this meeting four years ago of the young gangsters of Los Angeles, and it has exposed another slice of the biggest police corruption scandal in the city's history. <p>This week four LAPD officers have been standing trial in what could be the first of many such cases. And the outcome will have huge political, social and cultural ramifications. </p> <p>Stymie is Anthony Adams, a member of the Temple Street gang who had killed Lizard, a leading member of the Mexican Mafia - a fearsome prison based gang strong enough to order killings from behind bars. </p> <p>Lizard had been collecting \"taxes\" on his gang's behalf and Stymie had shot him \"as a 'we're not going to pay' kind of thing\". The MM could not let this go unpunished and had demanded thousands of dollars as a \"fine\" before removing the \"green light\". </p> <p>The meeting that was due to take place at the corner of Temple Street and Coronado, a patch known to the police as the Snakepit, was for gang members to discuss how they were going to pay this fine. The police planned to be there, too, and pick up Stymie and his pals. </p> <p>The person explaining all this to fascinated jurors in the city's courtroom 109 is Brian Liddy, one of the accused. He looks like a bull in a sports jacket and is sitting in the witness box on this balmy November day being questioned by his attorney, Paul DePasquale. </p> <p>What happened after Liddy and his colleagues arrived at the Snakepit that night is what the jurors have to decide. </p> <p>Did he and his fellow officer, Michael Buchanan, really get hit by a pick-up truck driven by a getaway gangster or did they make the whole thing up, and frame and beat up the gang member? And are the officers part of a vast scandal that has led to killings, beatings, framings and drug dealing - all carried out by the men who should be enforcing the law? </p> <p>That story starts with Rafael Perez, a policeman caught stealing 2.7kg (6lb) of cocaine from a police locker room in 1998. In a plea bargain deal, he was given a five-year jail sentence in exchange for information about corruption among his fellow officers. </p> <p>What Perez told investigators has now led to more than 100 people having their convictions overturned and left the city facing bills for an estimated $135m (\u00a393m) in law suits from ex-gang members who were framed, beaten and, in one case, paralysed. One victim will not be suing personally: Juan Saldana, 21, was shot and left to bleed to death with a gun planted beside him. </p> <p>Every week over recent months it has seemed that a gang member, usually Latino, has emerged from prison with tales of beatings and plantings. </p> <p>One of the very worst cases was that of Javier Ovando, who was allegedly shot and paralysed by Perez and his fellow officer, Nino Durden. The officers then accused Ovando of attempted murder and he was jailed for 23 years, with the judge chiding him for his lack of remorse. Ovando is out now and will be compensated but will not walk again. </p> <p>The police union, the Police Protection League, has claimed that Perez was a rogue cop and was only implicating his colleagues to save his own skin. But morale among officers has slumped. They say they are now so concerned about being accused of framing or beating gang members that they spend their hours on duty avoiding trouble. This may be the reason for the recent rise in gang shootings, and the renewed activity among the more than 400 gangs and 60,000 gang members in the city. </p> <p>There is a heavy political undertow in LA to accusations that the police have abused their power. In 1992, 54 people died after the riots that followed the acquittal of officers caught on video beating Rodney King. In 1965, in the Watts section of LA, it was police action against an alleged drink driver that led to the riots in which 34 died. This time the city wants to show that it is acting properly, and hence the Los Angeles district attorney, Gil Garcetti, has initiated the prosecutions. </p> <p>Liddy, Buchanan and two other officers, Paul Harper and Edward Ortiz, accused of conspiring to pervert or obstruct justice, are the first fruits of Mr Garcetti's labours. And as their trial comes to its conclusion, there is a political dimension: Mr Garcetti is running for re-election next Tuesday. A conviction would help his credibility and an acquittal would pose questions about his judgment. </p> <p>This week has come a new twist: Perez is not giving evidence as planned because his ex-girlfriend has now claimed that he and a fellow rogue officer, David Mack, had killed a drug dealer and his mother and had buried their bodies in a rubbish tip in Tijuana, Mexico. The Mexican police found no remains. </p> <p>Perez is duly \"pleading the fifth\" - refusing to give evidence in case he incriminates himself in a double murder. But whatever happens in this case, the ramifications are already being felt throughout the city. </p> <p>A few miles from the downtown courthouse, in Boyle Heights in the Latino area of the city, sits Frank, as he suggests we call him. Frank, a good-looking, shaven-headed 20-year-old in a Nike jacket and jeans, has cut his teeth with the Playboys gang. He says that the framing of young gang members is routine and is himself suing the LAPD for planting marijuana and crack on him, which led him to a year in jail. </p> <p><b> Different rules</b><br> </p> <p> \"Rafael Perez was known to us more as a businessman than a policeman. He was one of the big dealers. Have things changed because of what happened? The police just play by different rules now.\" </p> <p>He said that instead of planting drugs on gang members, the police now arrest them for petty offences. \"They do it with righteous excuses now but they're still there.\" </p> <p>Frank is sitting in a room at the back of the centre where Father Greg Boyle - \"G-Dog\" as the young gang members call him - runs a programme that helps them find work and tries to get them out of the gang cycle. </p> <p>Father Greg, who probably knows as many gang members as anyone in California, has noticed a dramatic change in policing since the scandal broke, but it is not a change he welcomes. </p> <p>\"What we have now is police abuse that takes the form of absence,\" he says. \"There is an over-cautious tentativeness, a reluctance to stop the people that they should. They want to get to the ends of their shift not just without being shot but without having a grievance filed or a complaint levelled. Either they're violating human rights in the name of law enforcement or they have a hands-off policy. Both are wrong and both are not helpful. </p> <p>\"I buried my 85th and 86th kids last week,\" says Father Greg. \"One was a 19-year-old gang member and one was a 10-year-old girl caught in the crossfire. A lot of that comes from the tension that kept mounting that could have been largely remedied by a police presence but because we didn't have any, that [the shootings] became an inevitability.\" </p> <p>Back in court, the two young prosecuting attorneys, Laura Laesecke and Anne Ingalls, cross-examine other officers. Without Perez their case is weak. It is further weakened by the reluctance of the police witnesses to remember too clearly what happened on key nights. But Ms Laesecke has got her teeth into the case. She rides the constant cries of \"objection\" from the high-profile all-male defence attorneys as she tries to construct the case against the four. </p> <p>The judge, the elegant Jacqueline Connor, has been attacked by the local press for being pro-police. She watches as Liddy pauses for a split second while he answers as to whether he kicked the fleeing gang member so hard between the legs that he soiled himself. </p> <p>The presidential election has taken over the city's front pages and the taxes being discussed are the ones George W Bush would like to cut, not the kind imposed by the Mexican Mafia. The circumstances that created LA's gangs, the drug laws that take them to court and the jails in which so many languish have not been part of the presidential debate. Neither of the frontrunners offers much in the way of penal reform or a shift in the distribution of wealth. </p> <p>Amazingly to some outsiders, includ ing New York journalists covering the case, there has been little public outrage. To many in LA, it seems, what happens to the young gang members is what they deserve. </p> <p>James Ellroy's book LA Confidential told a story of police corruption in the 1950s, but it was not written until 1990. Perhaps we will have to wait a while for the full story of the current scandal and another 40 years to see Rafael Perez and his gang of untouchables on the big screen in all their terrible glory. </p> <p><b>Crimes and punishments</b></p> <p><b> July 1996</b><br> Police swoop on Temple Street gang and claim to have been injured by fleeing gang members.

  "On the night of August 9, 1969, on the leafy streets of West Hollywood, the Manson \"family\" carried out the ritual murders of five people, including the actress Sharon Tate. The killings spread fear and revulsion across the Hollywood Hills and beyond, signalling both the end of the hippy dream and the beginning of a collective psychic unease. Back then, riven by a foreign war and a cauldron of domestic unrest, America found in Charles Manson - who was a hippy and a psychopath - the bogeyman it needed. <p>Now, more than 30 years later, West Hollywood is home to a rock star whose celebrity arguably outstrips even that of the killer whose surname he has adopted - whether in homage or as provocation it's hard to tell. Marilyn Manson, at 30, inhabits a complex role: the pop star as scapegoat.</p> <p>In the past few years, he has been accused by politicians, church leaders and concerned parents, of corrupting and depraving America's young - nothing new here in rock'n'roll terms. What took the collective fury to a new plane was the shootings at Columbine high school in Colorado last year, when two boys killed 12 of their classmates and a teacher. </p> <p>In the media-fuelled hysteria that followed, Manson was held responsible: the boys were followers of his, so the accusations went (wrongly as it turned out), and his music was an incitement to murder. </p> <p>He has, in short, become a focus for the anger, disgust and helplessness that America feels when confronted with irrefutable evidence of its own fallibility. Though obviously shaken by the intensity of the post-Columbine media witch-hunt, the role of contemporary American scapegoat is one Marilyn Manson revels in, and exploits for maximum melodrama. </p> <p>The release of his new album, Holy Wood (In the Shadow Of The Valley Of Death), is timed to coincide with the climax of the presidential election campaign, which should be doubly interesting because the Democratic candidate for vice-president, senator Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, is one of Manson's most consistent, and loudest, critics, famously describing the group as \"perhaps the sickest act ever promoted by a mainstream record company\". </p> <p>Manson's position as rock's reigning controversialist will be reinforced. \"Oh, it's sure to start again as soon as I put my head above the parapet,\" he chuckles, obviously relishing the notion, \"simply because I don't think the people I am attacking will ever understand the satire or the irony in my work. </p> <p>\"They will react to the surface in the same old knee-jerk way and hate me, and probably want to kill me again. And that really does fuel my fire. See, I guess I need them like they need me. They don't have a living, breathing devil and I am more than happy to play that role.\" </p> <p>Since the extraordinary success of his cross-over album, 1996's Antichrist Superstar, which entered the US charts at number three and has since sold several million copies, and at a time when rock music seems a hopelessly outmoded medium for rebellion and dissent, he has been an inspired provocateur and a lightning rod for controversy; someone who effortlessly inflames the right and doggedly tests the tolerance of liberal America. </p> <p>Today, though, his etiolated frame stretched out on a sofa in the dimly-lit interior of his manager's chic, minimalist office, Marilyn Manson comes across as the antithesis of his reputation. He immediately apologises for his lateness, which, by celebrity standards, is not really late at all. His responses are measured, thoughtful, often incisive. He is dressed head-to-toe in black, a pair of designer wraparound shades completing an ensemble that looks more Gucci than goth. </p> <p>His stick-thin frame is topped with an androgynous face whose pallor is emphasised by the shock of lank black hair that falls to his shoulders. In this light, he could pass for Nick Cave's slightly camp, even ganglier, younger brother. His voice is low, his enunciation slow and slightly drawled as seems to be the vogue among America's current arbiters of unease. </p> <p>He does not, though, seem pharmaceutically dislocated in the manner of say, Harmony Korine, the young auteur of trailer-park America, whom Manson considers one of his few creative compatriots. One senses this is someone who takes himself, his music, and his role as America's reigning rock seer and self-styled spawn of Satan utterly seriously. \"I consider myself an artist,\" he says at one point. \"I like to think I'm more Oscar Wilde than Ozzy Osbourne\". </p> <p>It is difficult to imagine what Wilde would make of a song such as Scabs, Guns &amp; Peanut Butter, whose title alone gives fair indication of the singer's abiding obsessions. His imminent album consists of a fresh slew of songs such as Disposable Teens, Target Audience (Narcissus Narcosis) and A Place In The Dirt; songs about guns and religion, mass media and martyrdom, alienation and death. </p> <p>These are the constants of Marilyn Manson's work, articulated in his trademark angsty, screechy voice against a backdrop of loud, brutal, riff-leaden goth-metal. It is an acquired taste: readers of Kerrang! will be on relatively safe ground; anyone who prefers music that can be described in terms of \"nuance\" or even \"melody\" would be well advised to look elsewhere. On The Death Song, he howls a not untypical refrain: \"We are on a bullet and we're headed straight into God\". Subtlety, as one glance at his wardrobe will attest, is not Manson's strong point. </p> <p>Then again, subtlety would probably be lost both on his target audience, the hordes of alienated American adolescents who lap up this stuff, and on his myriad opponents, who view him as a threat, not just to the minds of their impressionable sons and daughters, but to the American way of life itself. </p> <p>\"I actually think I'm engaged in a revolution,\" he tells me, without a trace of irony, \"in a fight worth fighting. Our generation don't have a war. This is our fight, and it is against conservatism and ignorance, whether in American politics or American Christianity.\" </p> <p>Born and raised plain Brian Warner in the town of Canton, Ohio, Manson is the son of a nurse and a furniture salesman who served as a helicopter mechanic in Vietnam. His childhood was certainly strange: he underwent regular physical and psychological studies conducted by a government agency in order to determine whether his health had been affected by his father's possible contact with Agent Orange, the highly toxic pesticide dumped over Vietnam by American forces. </p> <p>He was, he has said, the only one in these groups of the offspring of Vietnam vets who was not physically deformed, and retains to this day an attraction to what he calls, \"physical otherness\". In the first chapter of his by turns hilarious and disgusting biography, The Long Hard Road Out Of Hell, he describes in lingering detail an interlude when he spied on his grandfather masturbating in a room full of toy trains. Sickness and sexual perversion, usually sadistic, retain an abiding fascination for the adult Warner, whose stock-in-trade is shock, self-abasement and transgression.</p> <p>It is possible that Brian Warner might never have metamorphosed into Marilyn Manson had his parents not sent him to the Heritage Christian School in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, in 1974, where he learned that albums by WASP, Judas Priest and Queen were conduits for the teachings of Satan. </p> <p>Inspired, he made his first recordings there, taping and selling his own songs about sexual perversion, masturbation and farting. Like Korine, or Trey Parker, co-creator of South Park, he was a regular middle-class, middle-American heavy metal kid, and also a budding capitalist. \"I'd buy a WASP record for seven bucks and then sell it to some kid whose parents wouldn't allow him to go to the store,\" he told Rolling Stone magazine in 1996, \"then later in the day I'd go steal the album back and keep it for myself. I didn't realise it at the time but there's always been this underlying theme in the stuff that I do: it's teaching people not to be stupid.\" </p> <p>By the late 80s, the teenaged Brian Warner was writing prose - \"horror stories mostly\" - for Night Terror magazine and contributing features and interviews to a rock magazine, The 25th Parallel, for which he interviewed Trent Reznor, lead singer of industrial goth-metal group, Nine Inch Nails. </p> <p>Soon after, Warner formed his first group, Marilyn Manson &amp; The Spooky Kids. \"I wanted a name that said it all, almost a brand name. I took a celebrity martyr and a celebrity killer and put them together. If you want to understand America, you have to look at the celebrity process. It's sick and its utterly revealing about our need to celebrate even the worst aspects of our culture.\" </p> <p>In 1993, Marilyn Manson signed to Reznor's Nothing label, releasing Portrait Of An American Family, produced by Reznor in his own home - the house where Sharon Tate was murdered. The album was a cult success, the subsequent tour, a sign of what was to come: Manson was arrested in Jacksonville, Florida, for \"violation of the Adult Entertainment Code\" for allegedly exposing himself and simulating sex on stage. </p> <p>The following year, an EP entitled Smells Like Children appeared, and the group hit pay dirt with an inspired reading of the Eurythmics' typically anodyne Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This), which suddenly seems loaded with all manner of murky undertones. </p> <p>Fuelled by some Herculean multi-drug use, the 1995 American tour descended into a marathon orgy of self-abuse and attendant controversy that culminated, in true Spinal Tap fashion, with Manson sacking drummer Sara Lee Lucas by setting fire to his drum kit midway through a show. (Odd, sexually contrary pseudonyms seem to be a prerequisite for the group, which currently includes Madonna Wayne Gacy and Manson's longtime associate, Twiggy Ramirez.) Among the backstage diversions was an on-camera confession booth designed supposedly to \"suck sins\" from fans and groupies. </p> <p>In The Long Hard Road Out Of Hell, one chapter details the torture and sexual degradation of willing, usually female, fans, many of whom have carved his name on their chests as an act of homage. In places, I tell him, the book reeked of old school rock'n'roll misogyny, in others, it suggests a warped imagination addicted to wilful exaggeration. </p> <p>He seems to interpret this as a compliment. \"Well, I do have a gift for hyperbole,\" he drawls. \"But, often, the things that seem the most exaggerated can be the most true. I'll leave it to the discerning reader to make up their own mind.\" Did he, I wonder, regret some of the depths that he has plumbed in the past: the humiliation of already damaged individuals who seem drawn to Manson and his music in order to vindicate their dysfunctionalism rather than to find redemption. </p> <p>There is a thoughtful pause. \"Well, I don't see it that way. Regret is a negative emotion, like guilt. Plus, I attract outsiders and misfits because I am one. I think I voice a lot of their alienation because for a long time I felt it. Still do, to a degree. That said, there is evolution and character growth in everyone, and things I did even a year ago, or five years ago, I wouldn't do now. It was, how shall I put it, a voyage of discovery. I had to go out there and experience it all.\"</p> <p>Although Manson ended up in hospital from his spiralling drug habit during the making of 1996's Antichrist Superstar, the difficult birth produced a record that propelled him into the mainstream. An impossibly convoluted goth-metal concept album about personal and global apocalypse, Antichrist Superstar remains Marilyn Manson's defining statement. </p> <p>Though it sounded neither new nor particularly inspired, it was perfectly timed: a big, doomy, histrionic, end-of-the-millennium howl of anger and anguish. Plus, Manson looked weird, otherworldly even, and, like David Bowie as Ziggy Stardust before him, paraded his polysexuality almost as a badge of identity. </p> <p>From this side of the Atlantic, it is difficult to make sense of Manson's celebrity infamy and the hysteria he provokes, not least because his music has never brought him any critical credibility. Although the genre was invented in the UK by groups such as The Cure, The Mission and Sisters Of Mercy, goth is seen here as the music of the terminally adolescent and unapologetically pretentious: a soundtrack for those who spend their lives in black-painted bedrooms convinced that moroseness is an aesthetic end in itself. </p> <p>In America, though, most notably on the sunny, unreal West Coast, goth, whether old school (The Cure, The Cult), industrial (Ministry, Nine Inch Nails), or arty (The Smashing Pumpkins, Marilyn Manson), equals cool. In the land of sun-tanned, health-obsessed body fascism, a penchant for black eyeliner, pale skin and layers of greying lace and velvet signifies otherness, outsiderdom, and remains a sure-fire way to shock and outrage parents, politicians and society at large. What is dismissed here as adolescent pantomime posturing, more Addams family than Manson family, is often seen over there as the first step on the slippery slope to eternal damnation. </p> <p>Manson's now infamous 1996/7 Dead To The World tour was a triumph of spectacle and puerility. The provocations included wilful obscenity: mock copulation, onanism and flagellation; and even more wilful blasphemy: a pulpit draped in pseudo-fascist banners from which he ripped up copies of the Bible, and led the audience in chants of \"kill God\". Needless to say, the Christian right responded vigorously, picketing gigs and lobbying the Senate and state authorities in (sometimes successful) attempts to have shows banned. Things reached an absurd pitch when, in Texas, a fan was arrested on his way to a gig for wearing a Marilyn Manson T-shirt.</p> <p>Manson fuelled anger and opprobrium, as well as obsessive devotion, across America, in much the same way that the Sex Pistols did in Britain in 1977. But, whereas Johnny Rotten and his cohorts homed in on the Queen as the symbol of all things moribund and hypocritical about Great Britain, Manson chose God - or, to be more precise, contemporary Christianity - as the symbol of everything in mainstream America he held in contempt.</p> <p>He aroused an almost primordial fear in the hearts of his enemies by declaring in interviews that he was a Satanist. In his biography, he writes, \"The devil doesn't exist. Satanism is about worshipping yourself, because you are responsible for your own good and evil ... I'm not, and never have been, a spokesperson for Satanism. It's simply part of what I believe in, along with Dr Seuss, Dr Hook, Nietzsche and the Bible ... \" </p> <p>Again, the irony, as well as the veiled retraction, was lost on the American religious right. There are currently countless Christian and/or concerned parents' anti-Marilyn Manson internet sites. The Dayton Family Network, for instance, prints Manson's song lyrics preceded by the following warning: \"Please proceed only if you are prepared to confront Satan himself\". A show in Orlando, Florida, in 1999, was picketed by Christian groups who distributed a protest prayer, which, in its apocalyptic poetry, gives some indication of the kind of mind-set Manson has chosen, in his singular way, to do battle with. It reads:</p> <p>O foul and evil spirits who have brought</p> <p>The music group Marilyn Manson into Orlando,</p> <p>And have consumed and possessed the bodies and minds</p> <p>Of all who are part of the group or an aid to their movements,</p> <p>By the power given us by Jesus Christ, and in his holy name,</p> <p>We hereby bind the buses and trucks that will bring</p> <p>Marilyn Manson and their music into our community,</p> <p>We bind the engine that makes the car run,</p> <p>And the fuel that makes the engine run,</p> <p>We bind the lights and the amplifiers,</p> <p>The microphones and the musical equipment</p> <p>Needed for their vile and blasphemous</p> <p>performance. We bind the mouth and hands and feet</p> <p>Of the members of Marilyn Manson</p> <p>So that they cannot sow lies</p> <p>And spread discontent among our youth ...</p> <p>Needless to say, the show went ahead. \"That kind of reaction is kinda boring now,\" Manson sighs, drawing bony fingers through his hair. \"It's, like, so preprogrammed and one dimensional and dumb in a particularly American way. The thing that bugs me most about Christians is their assumption they have a monopoly on morality; the premise they start from is that they have a literally God-given right to impose their belief systems on everyone else. </p> <p>\"It's like, those people in Africa are heathens, we need to convert them to God. I mean, c'mon, in this day and age. It's almost too easy to get them going but, in a way, it needs to be done because they do have real power, and they'd like to be able to silence anyone who differs. Religion is big business in America and it's not taxed. How morally wrong is that? I kinda see myself, among other things, as a fighter for freedom of speech. I plead the First Amendment every time.\"</p> <p>If 1998's Mechanical Animals, which added glam-rock signatures to the goth-metal formula, suggested that Manson had mellowed, the events of April 20, 1999, suddenly sealed his reputation as the man America loved to hate. And blame. </p> <p>On that day, two high school students, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, both members of a loosely-knit teenage cabal who shared a Hitler fixation, and called themselves the Trenchcoat Mafia, walked into Columbine high school in Littleton, Colorado, and killed 13 people. The apparently motiveless massacre sent America into a frenzy of recrimination, which centred not on obvious contributing factors such as the easy availability of guns nor the dysfunctional family backgrounds of the two protagonists, but on the search for a scapegoat. </p> <p>Rock's sexually indeterminate, self-confessed Satanist was the figure they chose to blame. KILLERS WORSHIPPED ROCK FREAK MANSON, howled the Sun, aping the headlines across the Atlantic, before adding to the mountain of misinformation and exaggeration that now clung to his name: \"The reviled rock star's live shows feature routines such as smoking dried excrement, performing depraved sex acts and torturing animals.\" </p> <p>In America, the anti-Marilyn Manson frenzy reached such intensity that he was forced to cut short his tour amid fears of reprisals on the band and road crew. \"I saw it happen live on TV and I said immediately, 'They're going to blame me for this.' Five minutes later, I heard the reporter say, 'The killers were wearing white make-up and Marilyn Manson T-shirts.' All completely untrue, as it turned out. I mean, they didn't even like me. I looked into it after it happened: they weren't wearing make-up, they weren't goth kids. </p> <p>\"These were white, urban kids, pretty well-off, with no apparent reason to go on a killing spree. They weren't white trash nor ghetto kids, and I think that was difficult for America to take. It raised some hard questions about our society but, of course, the knee-jerk response prevailed - 'Who's to blame? Let's get the weirdo.' The way I see it, the mass psychology is - as long as America can find a bad guy, everyone can feel safe. It's that simple.\" </p> <p>In the end, finding that \"in the business, suddenly all these doors were shutting in my face\", Manson wrote an impassioned and articulate response in Rolling Stone magazine. \"I was approached by every media outlet in America, but I refused to be part of the charade. Then, when things died down a bit, I thought, I have to respond to this. I mean, I was upset like everyone else by what happened. I'm not some emotionless creature. I thought it was horrendous and sad. </p> <p>\"But, mostly, I was disgusted, I mean, these guys got exactly what they wanted - fame. They were on the cover of Time magazine. To me, it was grotesque. And, I was disgusted by the media sitting back there, judging and blaming everyone else for what they had helped create. I threatened to sue any media outlet that associated my name with the Columbine killings. There was no way I was going to be the fall guy for a nation\".</p> <p>The fallout of the Columbine killings seems to have effected some kind of sea-change in Marilyn Manson's outlook. You get the feeling he is no longer content with shock and provocation for its own sake, nor with the reductive, almost cartoonish, image of himself that prevails among all but his most loyal fans. </p> <p>He stays indoors a lot when he is not on the road, holed up in his Hollywood Hills mansion, once owned by Harry Houdini, another master of illusion and self-mythology. His tabloid-documented romance with actress Rose McGowan seems to have stabilised him somewhat, psychologically as well as creatively. </p> <p>The new album, though still histrionic and angst-ridden, seems somehow less self-obsessed, more concerned with the bigger picture: a nation's need for bad guys, demons, scapegoats whom it can vilify and simultaneously canonise. But Manson's music is still one long howl against: against the mainstream, against his detractors, but mainly against the America that made him. </p> <p>\"I'm still angry,\" he admits, \"but I'm happy too. I'm happy so long as I can express myself without being censored, if I can fight back, tell people they don't have to be sheep, that it's all right not to conform, not to compete, not to fit in. There's an added dimension because everything is shifting so fast - technology, information - and the powers that be are afraid because they sense that their kids are way smarter than them. When people are afraid, they run to religion, to the right. That's what's happening in America, that's why it's so easy - and so dumb - to put the blame on someone like me.\" </p> <p>And yet, without the vilification of the Christian and political right, one cannot help thinking that Marilyn Manson would simply be another loud, wilfully obnoxious, schlock-rock American metal act screaming at the converted. Currently the alternative, and even mainstream, American charts are full of the same, groups such as Limp Bizkit and Slipknot: young, white, whiny American brats whose puerile songs and tired tirades suggest a terminal cultural solipsism rather than any real radicalism. </p> <p>What sets Manson apart is his ability to push all the right buttons that, without fail, send his opponents into paroxysms, then to milk the shock and hysteria to the max. Marilyn Manson may be a weirdo, but he is a media-savvy, techno-literate weirdo. \"People think I'm a monster who eats puppies,\" he says. \"But, y'know, I don't even take that on board any more. And, despite everything that's happened, I feel strangely optimistic. I have a strange sense of idealism and even altruism. </p> <p>\"At the same time,\" he adds, \"I might just get up in the morning and spray a gallon of hairspray into the air just to destroy the ozone layer because I really believe mankind deserves nothing more than to end itself because we have behaved so idiotically for so long.\" </p> <p>Try as he may, Marilyn Manson cannot transcend the adolescent within: therein lies his creative and political limitations - and the key to his extraordinary success. Currently a much bigger superstar than an antichrist, his fame says more about America than all his songs put together. To his credit, he is aware of the irony. \"I'm in a strange place, all right,\" he admits. \"What I set out to subvert, I got sucked into in some way. That's the nature of celebrity - I've become part of what I set out to destroy. That's the big struggle right now. Who knows where it will end?\" What's the worst thing, I ask in conclusion, that could happen to you? \"I guess I could become a role model,\" he answers, grimacing. \"Now, that would be really hard to take.\"</p> <p>\u0095 Holy Wood (In the Shadow Of The Valley Of Death) will be released on the Nothing/Interscope label on November 13.</p>",
  "<p>In the spring of 1998, I decided I'd like to write a book about the 1925 Scopes \"Monkey\" Trial, the celebrated trial of a schoolteacher accused of teaching evolution in defiance of Tennessee law. This was not an arbitrary choice. My great-great-grandfather was Charles Darwin - something I had given little thought to as an adult until I came to live in America and discovered that his theories were still rabidly contested here. A US Gallup poll taken last year found that 40% of those surveyed favoured teaching creationism instead of evolution in public schools. That same year, the Kansas Board of Education voted to delete virtually every mention of evolution from the state's science curriculum. </p> <p>In early childhood I was told how Darwin's theory of evolution had demolished the biblical story of creation. And if the very first chapter of the Good Book was nonsensical and untrue, why should the rest be any more credible or useful? My parents made an attempt to raise me as a Christian, but ultimately lacked the conviction to boost me over the numerous improbabilities. </p> <p>Most modern scientists - perhaps 99% - believe the world is about 4bn years old. Professor Kurt Wise, associate professor of science and director of origins research at Bryan College in Dayton, Tennessee, puts its age at somewhere around 6,000 years. Kurt teaches his course in two parts: the first from the perspective of theistic evolution - that is, the idea that God used evolution over long periods of time to create the universe. The second half of the course is where he teaches what he really believes: that the \"six days of creation\" were in fact regular \"earth rotation days\" because the same word for \"day\" is used in the Ten Commandments when we are instructed to work six days and rest on the seventh. </p> <p>Kurt is taking a group of Bryan College summer students on a cave geology tour and he invites me along. Several white vans, replete with Christian youth, are parked outside the college. I find one with an empty seat at the back, clamber past a group of clean-cut types of both sexes, and settle in for the ride. \"I hear, like, intellectuals, a lot of them commit suicide?\" squeaks a zit-encrusted teenage boy. \"'Cause they believe what they're taught, evolution an' all, so they got nothing to live for?\" And now he fixes me with a mordant look, like maybe I'm one of them. \"That's true, statistically true,\" says another young man. \"They don't have God in their lives, they don't have Jesus as their personal saviour.\" \"Amen,\" says one of the girls. </p> <p>We've been driving for half an hour before they ask me why I'm here. I keep it simple: a book on the Scopes trial. Most of them are from rural states: South and North Carolina, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Utah, and Minnesota. Many have been taught at home; most are pleasant but uninteresting, the weird similarity of their views making it hard to distinguish one from another. After about an hour, we arrive at Grassy Cove, a pastoral valley between faint blue mountains, and turn off the main road on to a dirt track. There must be at least 50 of us tramping along in the heat. The entrance to the cave is a ragged horizontal slit, like a mouth clumsily hacked into a Halloween pumpkin. Even more alarming, it's at ground level. Doughty Christians insert themselves into it with difficulty, slither down in steep descent and disappear. Kurt has divided us into small groups, which depart at intervals of five or 10 minutes. </p> <p>Flashlight-less, intensely dubious, I squeeze through the hole. The downward skid is actually quite short. I find myself muddy but uninjured. As Kurt cannot be at every \"point of interest\", he has stationed older students at each, all holding a piece of paper on which is typed what Kurt would have said had he been there: \"The Flood Did It.\" That's the basic message. What the majority of geologists believe took millions of years, Kurt and his fellow creationists believe was done a few thousand years ago in a matter of months, when Noah was forced to sea with all the animals on earth, including his family but excluding the fish. </p> <p>We're asked by the first of Kurt's surrogates, a young woman, to observe a well-preserved fossilised brachiopod in limestone. A brachiopod is a kind of shellfish. We are 1,000ft above current sea level and you can find fossils like this all across America at similar elevations. If brachiopods decay or if they get moved any distance, the muscle that holds the shells together fails, and the shells separate. Modern brachiopods, if they're found whole at all, we're told, are usually found with the shell open and the opening facing upward. This fossilised brachiopod appears to be complete, has its shell closed, and it's on the tilt. To Kurt, this suggests that \"the critter\" was still alive when it was deposited, which suggests it was buried rapidly, which suggests, as Kurt puts it, \"a global diluvial catastrophe\". </p> <p>The student, reading Kurt's words, goes on to talk about the stalagmites near the entrance. Kurt argues that, as these stalagmites, though large, occupy less than 1% of the available space in the cave, they may not be as old as other geologists think; if they were, they would have filled the place up and we wouldn't be here. The cave is so grotesquely dramatic, so tortured, that Kurt's theory - suggesting an upheaval as violent as one's own alarm - does have emotional resonance. Certainly I can imagine a roiling wall of grey mud and rock roaring and cascading into the cave and carving out this infernal canyon. But Kurt seems to want to have his cave and eat it too: this deluge was so fantastically fierce that it burrowed this vast warren out of solid rock in under a year, yet not so fierce as to pulverise the delicate, twin-shelled brachiopod. </p> <p>Inside the next room lurks our new guide, a smiling, sanctimonious young man. When we are all gathered inside, he tells us to sit down and switch off our flashlights. Then, out of the blackness, comes his pious young voice: \"Why don't you lead off, Brittany?\" \"My God is an awesome God!\" sings Brittany in a sweet, high voice, and then the rest join in. \"Be praised!\" Then they all sing together: \"My God is an awesome God! Be praised!\" The room sounds like a small cathedral, more bass, less echo, but it is, I have to admit, pretty awesome, particularly in the darkness. </p> <p>Then we wander off toward the final and most horrific room of all: a vast, meandering, asymmetrical cavern. The ceiling is only 2-3ft from the floor and appears to be supported only by occasional rough columns formed by stalactites and stalagmites fusing together, each column tapering in the middle like some weirdly guttered candle. On top of this massive slab there's a billion tons of mountain and some loony creationist is asking you to crawl into this awful, ill-supported geological death-gap, which, if it collapsed, would leave you flatter than a dime, all so he can expound, through delegates, some nutty theory which every reasonable man on earth knows is utter hogwash. Only a fool would enter. In I crawl. </p> <p>We reach a central column, and slump down to listen to a lecture. I remember none of it. Finally, we're backing out. The mood lightens immediately, suggesting that perhaps I was not alone in my claustrophobic terror. The girls become chatty. I ask what the rules are. Most of them are obvious: no drugs, no cigarettes, no alcohol. A girl fills me in on the dress code. \"No tank tops, no tube tops, no halter tops, no spaghetti straps, no short shorts, and you have to have a one-piece bathing suit.\" As we wind our way up towards daylight, the girls become almost evanescent. One of them asks if I'm a believer. I guess they've rumbled me. </p> <p>\"You should come and sit in on some of our classes,\" she says. \"It would be really helpful.\" The atmosphere on the drive back toward Bryan College is friendlier than it was on the way here. They know who I am, they've absorbed it, and are willing to talk freely about themselves and their beliefs. Their religion, they tell me, is the only true religion, unique because Jesus Christ, the son of God, set foot on earth. No other religion can make that claim. </p> <p>The girls state that they would not marry a non-believer. In fact, they wouldn't even marry a Catholic unless he was born again because it would be hard to live with someone whom you knew was going to hell. Of all their beliefs, I tell them, this born-again-or-go-to-hell thing is the one I find hardest to take. If God is so perfect, why would he care whether you believed in him or not? It seems so petty. Believing in a literal hell, an inferno of unimaginable suffering, they accept with equanimity that seven-eighths of the world, including me, will end up in it. For ever. </p> <p>I am glad to arrive back at the college to be offered hotdogs from a barbecue grill. (The flames! The flames!) I take my food over to a patch of grass and sit down next to a couple of fellow cave-survivors. Exhausted and vaguely depressed, I find Kurt, thank him, and leave. </p> <p>If I went down to Dayton an atheist, I came back an agnostic, refusing to share the arrogance of any conviction in a matter so clearly unprovable either way. In his autobiography, Darwin, who also called himself an agnostic, wrote that the magnificence of the universe almost forces one to conclude that God exists. However, he continued, \"Can the mind of man, which has, as I fully believe, been developed from a mind as low as that possessed by the lowest animal, be trusted when it draws such grand conclusions?\" He goes on to say that the problem is compounded by \"the probability that the constant inculcation in a belief in God on the minds of children has produced so strong and perhaps inherited effect on their brains, that it may now be as difficult for them to throw off their belief in God as for a monkey to throw off its instinctive fear of a snake\". For this monkey at least, my great-great-grandfather was right. </p> <p>\u0095 This extract is adapted from Trials of the Monkey: An Accidental Memoir, by Matthew Chapman, which is published by Duck Editions on November 16 2000, price \u00a314.99.</p>",
  "<p>In the 16th century the Alps were as distant from the normal world as was the moon. To many they represented hell, combing the freezing conditions of a Nordic Niflheim , the Nordic mythological underworld, with, in summer, the roasting inferno of Christianity. Here was a realm whose upper reaches were, by all accounts, home to a race of malformed and malevolent sub-humans. The peaks above were inhabited by demons and witches were well attested. It was an undisputed fact that dragons lived in Alpine caves, ready to incinerate any who set foot above the snowline. By the late 18th century, however, scientific gentlemen began to turn their minds to these high places. What would the peaks tell us about the atmosphere, about weather, about glaciers? </p> <p>In the 19th century the British came on the scene, full of imperial confidence and set out to plant their flag on every peak in the Alps. The Matterhorn disaster of 1865 was one of those tragic events of which the Victorians were so fond and to which they were so prone. It ranked in popular imagination alongside Franklin's disappearance in the Arctic andLivingstone's death in Africa. It shaped the childhood perceptions of millions and it had, uniquely, a survivor who could describe it at first hand. Edward Whymper, who was only in his mid-20s at the time of the disaster, was bedevilled by it for the rest of his life </p> <p>On July 12 1865 Whymper, a printer and Alpinist, was in the small village of Breuil at the foot of the unconquered Matterhorn. He was woken with the news that an Italian party - led by the guide Jean-Antoine Carrel, whom Whymper thought he had hired to climb the mountain - had begun an ascent. </p> <p>Whymper was furious. He had been \"bamboozled and humbugged\". He snatched a telescope and peered through it. Yes, there was Carrel and his party, making their way up the lower slopes. But his group was large and unwieldy. It would take them three days to reach a position from which they could tackle the summit. If he moved fast, Whymper could be in Zermatt inside a day and, conditions willing, could be on the summit two days later. But he had no guide. Miraculously, Whymper was saved by the arrival of Lord Francis Douglas, an \"exceedingly amiable and talented\" 18-year-old whose brother, the Marquess of Queensberry, would later instigate the Oscar Wilde trial. </p> <p>Douglas was no stranger to daring exploits: he had scaled the walls of Edinburgh castle aged 14, and had swum the Hellespont aged 16. Although not an experienced mountaineer, he had done some fine climbing that season and had in tow Young Peter Taugwalder, namesake and son of Old Peter Taugwalder from Zermatt. </p> <p>Father and son had carved themselves a reputation for leading tourists up the easier slopes. Old Peter had reconnoitred the north-east ridge of the Matterhorn and was convinced, like Whymper, that it was surmountable. Whymper was immediately interested. Did Douglas truly want to climb the Matterhorn from Zermatt? Yes. Could Young Taugwalder carry their gear there? Douglas agreed and the next day the two Englishmen went down to the Monte Rosa hotel in Zermatt, where they instructed Old Peter Taugwalder to prepare for an immediate attack on the Matterhorn. </p> <p>The Rev Charles Hudson, and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Douglas Hadow, were also staying in the Monte Rosa and were also planning to climb the Matterhorn. Whymper and Hudson agreed that it would be wasteful for two separate teams to go up the Matterhorn. Hudson, vicar of Skillington in Lincolnshire, was the glamorous face of British mountaineering. He was a handsome, cheerful man. Young women stuck his photograph in their albums, from where it smiled out romantically above a dashing signature. But at the same time he was entirely self-effacing. \"Although he had done the greatest mountaineering feats which have been done, he was the last to speak of his own doings.\" Hadow was a different proposition. He was 19, and it was his first season in the Alps. In such a large expedition, the group was dependent on its weakest member. Hadow was indisputably the weakest member. </p> <p>For Hudson and Whymper, the Matterhorn was so much easier than they had expected that, on the morning of July 13, they led the way, taking turns to hack steps in the ice while the guides hung back. When they made camp on a ledge at 11,000 feet they were almost delirious. Croz, an experienced guide, and Young Peter Taugwalder scouted ahead and returned with the news that there was \"not a difficulty, not a single difficulty!... We could have gone to the summit and returned today easily!\" Everybody went to bed in good spirits. The next day Whymper handed the lead to Croz. The rocks were testing in places, and extremely exposed, but Whymper thought it a lot easier than other climbs. He was worried, however, by Hadow, who \"was not accustomed to this kind of work and required continual assistance\". </p> <p>They went up and up, crossing 400 feet horizontally here, ascending 60 feet vertically there, then doubling back to a convenient ridge when their way was blocked. There was an awkward corner and finally they were there, separated from the summit by 200 feet of snow. \"The last doubt vanished!\" Whymper wrote, \"The Matterhorn was ours!\" Whymper ran along the ridge. Peering over the edge, he saw his Italian rivals some 1,250 feet below, crawling like ants up the hillside. He and Croz yelled and waved their arms, to no apparent effect. \"We must make them hear us; they shall hear us,\" Whymper cried. He seized a block of stone and hurled it down. Croz joined him and together they wrestled lumps of crag down the cliff. Whymper crowed: \"The Italians turned and fled.\" </p> <p>Then came the flag-planting. One of the tent poles had been removed that morning - against Whymper's protestation that they were tempting providence - and it was now embedded on the northern end of the ridge with Croz's shirt tied to it as a flag. It was visible from all directions. </p> <p>Down in Breuil, convinced that their group had succeeded, the inhabitants came out en fete, toasting Carrel, Italy and the Matterhorn. It was only when the dejected team arrived home that they learned their mistake. \"It is true,\" said the Italians. \"We saw them ourselves - they hurled stones at us! The old traditions are true - there are spirits on the top of the Matterhorn!\" </p> <p> Around 3pm on July 14, Hudson and Whymper agreed on their order of descent. While they were roping up, Whymper spent a last few minutes sketching the summit and then, darting back up to put their names in a bottle, he took his place in the chain. The adrenalin which had carried them to the top was gone, leaving them shaky-legged and exhausted. They took exaggerated care on the rocks they had bounded up so eagerly that morning. Hadow, who was the weariest of them all, had his feet guided into position by Croz. Their precautions were standard practice for any well guided party coming home after a new conquest, save for one important difference - although the leaders were tied to one of the stronger ropes, Old Peter and Douglas were linked by the weakest of the lot. </p> <p>Croz put his axe to one side so that he could assist Hadow on a tricky slope. What occurred next could only be guessed at. Whymper's theory was that Croz had helped Hadow into a safe position and had then turned round to pick up his ice axe. As he did so, Hadow slipped and knocked Croz over. Whymper did not see it happen, his view being blocked momentarily by a rock, but he witnessed every moment of the subsequent tragedy. </p> <p>\"I heard one startled exclamation from Croz, then saw him and Mr Hadow flying downwards; in another moment Hudson was dragged from his steps, and Lord F Douglas immediately after him. All this was the work of a moment. Immediately we heard Croz's exclamation, Old Peter and I planted ourselves as firmly as the rocks would permit: the rope was taut between us and the jerk came on us both as one man. We held; but the rope broke midway between Taugwalder and Lord Francis Douglas. For a few seconds, we saw our unfortunate companions sliding downwards on their backs, and spread ing out their hands, endeavouring to save themselves. They passed from our sight uninjured, disappeared one by one, and fell from precipice to precipice on to the Matterhorngletscher below, a distance of nearly 4,000 feet. From the moment the rope broke, it was impossible to help them.\" </p> <p>Whymper and the two Taugwalders did not move for half an hour. Old Peter burst into tears. Young Peter cried, \"We are lost! We are lost!\" With difficulty Whymper persuaded Young Peter to leave his perch - they were still roped together and unless he moved they were stuck - then guided father and son back to Zermatt. They went down slowly and carefully, searching for their companions' bodies as they went, sometimes calling out in the vain hope that one of them might have survived. Whymper later wrote to a friend. \"For two hours after the accident I thought every moment that the next would be my last... the two guides were unnerved to such an extent that I suspected every minute one or the other would have slipped, and then it would have been all over.\" </p> <p>At 9.30pm, Whymper chose \"a wretched slab, barely large enough to hold the three\", on which to spend the night. Six hours later there was enough moonlight for them to continue the descent. They went down in silence, met the first chalets, and then ran all the way to Zermatt. Whymper burst into the Monte Rosa hotel and made for his room, pursued by an inquisitive landlord. As he closed the door he announced \"The Taugwalders and I have returned.\" </p> <p>The landlord roused the village and 20 men went on their way to the base of the north face. When they reached the scene they found Croz and Hadow lying next to each other on the snow, with Hudson some 50 yards distant. The bodies had been stripped almost naked during the fall and were so battered that they were barely recognisable - Croz was missing the top half of his head and was identified only by his beard and by a rosary cross. Of Douglas there was no trace, save a pair of gloves, a belt and a boot. His body had either caught on a ledge or had been shredded as it bounced from rock to rock. Apart from a single coat sleeve, nothing more was ever found of him. </p> <p>The news broke slowly, inaccurately and piecemeal. Whymper wrote a description of the tragedy in the visitors' book of the Monte Rosa, which was stolen almost immediately, but it was August 8 before he published a definitive account in the Times. Until then, wild rumours circulated that made Zermatt, briefly, the most famous place in Europe. Climbers from every nation rushed to the village, impelled by the desire to help, to offer condolences or simply to gawp. </p> <p>On July 19, the British consul in Geneva sent his chaplain to conduct a private inquiry and on July 21, Zermatt opened its own inquest. Midway through its deliberations, a wrenchingly ignorant telegram arrived from Douglas's mother, Lady Queensbury: \"Is it not possible to seek in the rocks above or to let down food?\" </p> <p>Meanwhile, Whymper was giving his deposition to the local court. He told everything as it had happened and blamed the fall entirely on the use of the weak rope. Looking at the piece he had retained as evidence, the officials accepted his deposition without question. It was flimsy beyond belief and had clearly snapped. (Sections of all three ropes are preserved in Zermatt's Alpine museum. The one that broke is little thicker than a washing line.) The verdict was accidental death. </p> <p> What was not explained (or asked), however, was why the weak rope had been used in the first place. Whymper threw out diversionary leads, blaming Hudson for having allowed Hadow to be a member of the party and hinting at a conspiracy within Zermatt's judicial system. Hadow's father thought Whymper had gone too far in abrogating all responsibility. \"We have been greatly distressed at Mr Whymper's letter in the Times and the leading article which I was sure would follow,\" he wrote on August 10. \"He might have spared those unnecessary remarks about poor Hudson, which have brought blame on him for want of prudence and caution.\" Emily Hudson, Charles Hudson's wife, felt the same. Lurid reports were already circulating and she was angry that Whymper should have cast her husband as the wrongdoer. \"I cannot tell you how it has distressed me,\" she wrote. \"I am very much surprised that Mr Whymper should have been a party to it. Of course one knows the craving there is in the public mind for the sensational, in any form; but it really makes me sick to think of such a subject being used to gratify their tastes.\" </p> <p>Whymper was released from the inquest on July 22 1865 and came home to find himself the most talked-about person in London. A fellow Alpine club member wrote that he was \"most truly to be pitied, for his name is so connected with the Matterhorn, and rather wild designs upon it, that people are sure to blame him for the accident\". </p> <p>Until that year, fatalities in the Alps had been relatively rare, something for the exploring community to remark upon; after that date they became commonplace. In 1870 an entire party of 11, led by a Scot, the Rev G MacCorkendale, got lost in a blizzard and perished on Mont Blanc. The bodies of six of the climbers were never found. As the fatalities increased, Queen Victoria's private secretary wrote to prime minister Gladstone, \"The Queen commands me to ask you if you think she can say anything to mark her disapproval of the dangerous Alpine excursions which... have occasioned so much loss of life.\" </p> <p>The Matterhorn disaster shaped the remainder of Whymper's life. Never very sociable, he withdrew still further. According to his sister, \"his unfortunate habit of sleeplessness had become fixed, and he practically turned night into day\". His main preoccupation was writing up his journals for publication. But he did not stop exploring: he made two expeditions to Greenland, he climbed new peaks in the Andes and the Rockies and, his funds having been exhausted by these forays, wrote guidebooks to Zermatt and Chamonix. He received the Royal Geographical Society's gold medal and was proposed for - but was not granted - membership of the Royal Society. The disaster was a topic he returned to again and again in lecture halls, magazine articles and private correspondence for the 46 years until his death, but he seemed interested only in proving that he was not to blame. </p> <p>Whymper's relations with women had not been successful, but in 1899 he fell in love with Charlotte Hanbury, one of the few women climbers active in the Alps. She was 10 years his senior and died unexpectedly the following October. The news reached him just as he was starting a lecture tour in America. \"My beloved friend gone!\" he wrote to his sister. \"I hardly know how to carry on.\" </p> <p> His health began to deteriorate and he became prone to unexpected collapses that left him in a state of semi-consciousness. In 1905 a fall on a mountain path damaged several ribs; he received a severe blow to the head in a railway accident. \"My present condition is deplorable,\" he wrote in October. \"My memory has gone !... [I am] a Wreck without Brains.\" His memory returned but he was concerned that he was losing fitness and, when he visited Zermatt a few weeks after the crash, it appeared that he was losing his fame as well. It was freezing, nobody was there to greet him and the hotels were full: he drew together two station benches and slept on them under a rug. </p> <p>The next year, at the age of 66, he married Edith Mary Lewin of Forest Gate, London. She was 45 years younger than him. The wedding was a grisly occasion, conducted in great secrecy. At the wedding breakfast it took half an hour's persuasion before Whymper could be dragged out of his bedroom. McCormick, the presiding vicar, gave a leery address about the difference in their ages. When the wedding was over, Whymper told his nephew, the only member of his family invited to the ceremony, to search the guests in case they had stolen the silver. </p> <p>The union did not last. The couple had a daughter and divorced in 1910. The separation was bitter. \"Her sole aim is money,\" he wrote to his sister. He sold his house, his books and even his climbing equipment to stay financially afloat. The following year he visited Zermatt, from where he went to Geneva and then up to Chamonix. It was to be his last Alpine scramble, and perhaps he knew it. </p> <p>At Chamonix he checked into a hotel where the staff were accustomed to his preference for being left alone. He visited a few bookshops and made arrangements to help find the corpses from the 1870 Mont Blanc disaster which were expected soon to emerge from the glacier. Then, suddenly, went back to his hotel and locked himself into his room. During the next two days, Whymper died. The whole village turned out to watch his funeral. </p> <p>All the great mountains were subsequently conquered one by one, by insouciant public schoolboys and dogged tradesmen alike. By the end of the second world war the Alps had changed irrevocably. Ski resorts proliferated as entrepreneurs devoured the empty spaces. </p> <p>Gradients were bulldozed and forests were cut down to create pistes. Ropes were pinned to the Matterhorn to make life easier for those wishing to conquer the Big Rock. This well-groomed wilderness was no place for dragons. Yet its upper levels retained a strange fascination. Climbers still strode across passes, clambered over glaciers and struggled with dangerous new routes. Far fewer in number than the thousands who rushed to the Alps every winter, they preserved a glimmer of the old romance. Like their predecessors, they were trespassers in a hostile environment; they were adventurers in an old tradition. </p> <p>\u0095 Adapted from Killing Dragons: the Conquest of the Alps by Fergus Fleming (Granta, \u00a320).

  "<p>In 1985 Kinky Friedman was a failing country-and-western singer, bearings lost in a blizzard of cocaine. \"A lot of my friends were dying of drugs,\" he recalls. \"I was doing enough Peruvian marching powder to decorate a large nativity scene, and my career was tanking. No one wanted to book me.\" </p> <p>One of Friedman's heroes, Hank Williams, had gone through the same mill three decades before: \"He'd had a string of number one hits, yet nobody would book him because he was a drunken idiot who would never show up or would fall off the stage.\" </p> <p>Williams went to Jesus full of whiskey and morphine in the back of a speeding Cadillac one New Year's Day. \"But I didn't have a perfectly timed country-music death,\" Friedman says. Instead, he latched onto a remark made by his sister Marcie: since he was so fond of detective stories, why not write one? </p> <p>That was 15 years ago, and Friedman's first novel, Greenwich Killing Time, has been followed by 12 others. He has kicked the nose candy and is now published in more than a dozen countries. His fans include Bill Clinton, who asked him to write more books - \"I need the laughs\" - and tried to fix up a Hollywood deal for him. </p> <p>Friedman didn't look far to find the character who animates all his novels. Both he and his amateur detective are Jewish Texans with dodgy 'taches and an unhealthy attachment to cowboy hats. Both love animals and cigars and once fronted country bands. Both show an immaturity about women and gays that seems more like wind-up than genuine attitude. Both are relentless, often irritating wisecrackers. \"I'm good for about three minutes of superficial charm,\" Friedman admits, \"then it begins to go downhill.\" Oh, and both go by the name of Richard \"Kinky\" Friedman. The K-word apparently refers to their hair. </p> <p>\"I wrote the first book using my own name, but planned to change the details before sending it to a publisher,\" he explains. But then he thought: \"Jesus, you got a name like Kinky Friedman, you really ought to run with it.\" </p> <p>For good measure, Friedman stuck in friends, family, other members of his old band, the Texas Jewboys, the family ranch in the Lone Star State, his temporary home in the Big Apple, his cokehead past, the women he had the hots for and, most memorably, his beloved cat Cuddles. Most gave him permission to use their names; Cuddles seems to have declined, as she is referred to only as \"the cat\". </p> <p>Friedman, 55, will never rival Agatha Christie for suspense or obfuscation. He may initially interest you in a murder or disappearance, but by the time his blundering alter ego has solved the case, you probably won't give a damn. He readily admits that his latest novel, The Mile High Club, \"is one of the few books I've written that has a plot\". </p> <p>But none of that matters. For a thoroughgoing smartass, \"the Kinkster\" is surprisingly vulnerable and open to beauty. The Mile High Club finds him paraphrasing Oscar Wilde's The Happy Prince for his feline friend. \"It takes a brilliant and troubled homosexual poet,\" he comments, \"to write a story about a statue and a bird that is so beautiful it can reach across an ocean and a century just to touch a man and a cat.\" </p> <p>There was the same mix of crassness and sensitivity in the songs Friedman wrote for the Texas Jewboys. They ranged from Get Your Biscuits in the Oven and Your Buns in the Bed, for which the National Organisation of Women named him male chauvinist pig of the year, to Rapid City, South Dakota, perhaps the first country song to touch on abortion, and the Holocaust spiritual Ride 'Em Jewboy. </p> <p>Friedman's novels combine a rough affection for his old chums with a general suspicion of humanity. Perhaps it dates back to that mid-1980s crisis; perhaps it's the result of being born \"the bastard son of two races\" - a Jew in America's most redneck state. Anyway, he says, \"People always let you down, as Jesus found out. And Van Gogh. And Mozart. And Anne Frank. And Oscar Wilde. Five of my heroes, all of whom died in paupers' graves, or no graves at all.\" </p> <p>Animals alone get unconditional love. The Texas ranch where he now lives is home to several dogs, a cat and an armadillo named Dilly, which surfaced in the novel Armadillos and Old Lace . He still writes about Cuddles, though she had to be put down in 1993. \"She was as close to me as any human being I have ever known,\" he declared in the epilogue to Elvis, Jesus and Coca-Cola . \"I dug her grave with a silver spade, in the little garden by the stream behind the old green trailer where both of us lived in summertime. Her burial shroud was my old New York sweatshirt and in the grave with her is a can of tuna and a cigar.\" </p> <p>As Friedman's writing career has taken off, so has his music. Willie Nelson, Tom Waits, Dwight Yoakam and Lyle Lovett covered his songs in a tribute album last year, and he's now in the middle of a European tour. \"Music is fun now that I don't have to do it,\" he says wryly. </p> <p>Even so, time may be running out for the character that gave Kinky Friedman his second chance at fame. \"I've written 15 books about the Kinkster now, including a couple that are not yet published. Perhaps it's time to try something different. So I'm seriously thinking of killing him off in a kind of Reichenbach Falls suicide. And if the literary community start clamouring for him to return ... well, we'll see.\" <br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502453819,00.html\">Buy The Mile High Club at BOL</a></p>",

With great deference to him, I thought civilization, from to civilize, better in the sense opposed to barbarity, than civility.\" </p> <p>Today we no longer reach so comfortably for words like \"barbarity\". But, as Boswell rightly points out, the word \"civilization\" is derived from the verb \"to civilize\", so what it can usefully denote is a process rather than a congealed achievement. Civilization, properly, is the process of rendering a society more civil. It is a political concept, deriving ultimately from the Latin \"civis\", citizen of a community, and the idea of what is proper to a citizen, which is \"civilitas\" or courtesy. It is in this sense that a beautifully sardonic Gandhi murmured that western civilization \"would be a good idea\". </p> <p>Felipe Fernandez-Armesto, however, claims to believe that the idea of a civilizing \"process\" - whereby societies might learn to live together more peacefully and productively - is tainted irrevocably by the horrors of 20th-century dreams of \"progress\": fascism and Soviet communism. This is rampant nonsense. The fact that some dreams of progress have been wicked is no good reason to abandon the idea of progress itself. It is undeniable that universal suffrage and the abolition of the death penalty have contributed to the civilization of this country in the past century. And we ought constantly to demand more civilization, rather than to abandon the idea completely out of a misguided world-historical pessimism. </p> <p>But then, the key to understanding the deliberate eccentricity of Fernandez-Armesto's book lies in his hysterical anti-liberalism. He is a man complacently \"waiting for the conservative nirvana\", and seriously claims at the book's climax that \"liberal principles become the forerunners of death camps and eugenics\". Such nasty pottiness bookends this fat work: at the start, he smears the work of Arnold Toynbee with the following disgustingly uncivil innuendo: \"Toynbee's enthusiasm for 'pioneer' leaders, steering civilization towards collective goals, seems chilling in a work published just after Hitler came to power.\" Another theorist of civilization, Kenneth Clark, is dismissed for what Fernandez-Armesto calls his \"warped perspective\". But Clark's perspective - his preference for a marble Apollo over an African mask - was no more \"warped\" than any other: it was simply a perspective. It would seem hard, indeed, to write from no perspective at all; unless, perhaps, you can attain the godlike objectivity of a Fernandez-Armesto. </p> <p>Our author's claim is that civilization is fundamentally a measure of how man refashions his environment to his own ends. He solicits both praise for this idea's novelty (\"This is an experimental work ... meant to be ... unprecedented\") and respect for its venerability (\"The usage I advocate is justified by tradition\"), thus setting a rigorously maintained precedent of having his cake and eating it. He notices that Toynbee had the idea in 1919, but dismisses his formulation on a technicality and then conveniently forgets about it. He promises grandly that his revolutionary new recategorisation will open up fresh vistas of historical truth. </p> <p>Up to a point. The central 500 pages are devoted to a grand tour of world history by environment: hostile wastelands of desert, tundra and ice; swathes of uncultivable grassland; tropical and temperate forests; alluvial soils; highlands, islands and \"seaboard civilizations\". The plurality of the book's title emphasises that civilization is not confined to western Europe or other lucky pockets of geography: human ingenuity ensures that it happens pretty much anywhere humans can stay alive. Great structures have been built in rebarbative rainforest or on shifting mud. Fernandez-Armesto's scheme enables pretty juxtapositions (the Aztecs, Ethiopians and Tibetans are seen to have overcome similar problems of altitude) and provocative revaluations (the Aztecs, again, seem more heroically competent in \"civilizing\" their environment than the classical Greeks). </p> <p>But Fernandez-Armesto, in the interest of covering all bases, is so systematically self-contradictory as to be almost comically incoherent. Environment shapes civilization; no, it doesn't; yes, it does; er, OK then, civilizations are \"neither determined nor uninfluenced by environment\". Well, who is going to argue with that? Temporary and mutually exclusive criteria of civilizational \"success\" flash past. The Inuit, for example, are less \"civilized\" than modern Europeans because they have adapted themselves to their icy environment rather than attempting to change it; then again, maybe civilization would be an \"irrational strategy\" in such terrain, \"at least where long-term survival is the goal\". But if long-term survival really were a valid criterion, that would imply that the Inuit have been more successful than, say, the imperial Romans, because the Inuit are still here. </p> <p>Fernandez-Armesto's definition of what sort of behaviour constitutes \"civilizing\" an environment becomes so loose at times - just eating bits of it and constructing ramshackle shelters seems to be enough - that it could accommodate badgers, nest-building birds and termites just as well as it does humans. Stretch the word that thinly and it becomes useless. Some part of him seems to recognise the explanatory poverty of his thesis, for he regularly has recourse to \"civilization\" and its cognates in their old senses, lapsing into the usage he has derided: specifically, city-building societies with complex political cultures. </p> <p> Civilizations, though stuffed with what ought to be fascinating historical facts and comparisons, is the sheerest drudgery to read, because Fernandez-Armesto only rarely remembers what he is supposed to be arguing and instead indulges in reams of irrelevant armchair tourism and purple-hued narration. Were his theory a coherent and useful one, in fact, he would have been able to write a much shorter book. The reader at least ought to be grateful that he thinks \"culture\" cannot explain anything (at least, about half the time he does; as with most of his sweeping statements, he denies it about as often as he asserts it), because his own swerves into that territory are quite shatteringly banal. \"Plato fancied himself as a political thinker,\" we are told facetiously; \"Confucius was part of a vibrant world of ideas\"; Romanticism is \"a scale of values which put emotion above reason\"; and Japanese religion \"surely represent[s] the way human minds work more typically than westerners of the present generations\". What on God's sweet earth can that mean? </p> <p>Oddly, for all his carefully burnished self-image as a pioneering, multicultural, iconoclastic historian, Fernandez-Armesto's prose is that of a parodic 19th-century buffer, an Anglophile gentleman amateur who congratulates himself on having written his book \"in something of a frenzy\" informed by \"no mature deliberation\", who rails constantly against the \"gimcrack rubbish\" of newfangled inventions such as the electronic watch and (I kid you not) the zippered fly, and who observes the dusty gleam of ancient societies with a patronising inverted snobbery, excusing what was violent, brutish and - yes - uncivilized about them. </p> <p> Civilizations is, finally, a useful book in one way only: it defines the sensible limits of multiculturalism by overstepping them. Fernandez-Armesto is of course right to emphasise that modern western civilization is not the historically privileged summit of human evolution, but to doubt that it is in every way better than a superstitious ancient culture of South America that regularly sacrificed newborn babies is the most irrational cant of all.</p>",
  "<p>Look away now if you don't want to know the score. Tonight Manchester United will not be appearing on Match of the Day. At least neither Sir Alex Ferguson nor any of his players or backroom staff will allow themselves to be interviewed after the game at Coventry City. All season the United manager has refused to cooperate with the nation's favourite football show, ordering the rest of his staff to keep mum too. Not even the former United man Garth Crooks, armed with one of his trademark 15-clause questions, will be able to scale the wall of silence. </p> <p>The big chill began when Ferguson read a suggestion in Match of the Day magazine which accused him of being a bully. He has, though, had disputes with the show before - in 1993 he went quiet after pundits criticised the total exclusion zone he had placed around Ryan Giggs - and BBC executives were hopeful this one could be resolved as quickly as in the past. After all, they pointed out, the magazine has no editorial links with the programme beyond a shared title. </p> <p>As the stand-off developed, negotiations took place at the highest level on both sides. Peter Kenyon, United's chief executive, was said to be keen on a thawing in relations and, through careful diplomacy by intermediaries, a resolution appeared to have been reached early last month. Word came through the day after England played Germany that normal service would be resumed the following Saturday. </p> <p>Then Ferguson read newspaper extracts from the Radio 5 Live commentator Alan Green's book about the pair's lengthy spat (they have not exchanged a civil word since Green made characteristically combative remarks about Roy Keane during the 1995 FA Cup semi-final). As a response to the Green book Ferguson raised the ante, issuing a blanket ban on all contact with the BBC. Radio and television, local and national, the silence from players and management at the country's top football club is absolute. </p> <p>Ferguson is understood to believe there is an anti-United bias at the corporation involving Green, the ex-Liverpool duo of Alan Hansen and Mark Lawrenson, and the former editor of Match of the Day Brian Barwick, a Liverpool fan. It is a belief that remains unshaken even though the current Match of the Day editor, Niall Sloane, is a United fan and the editor of Match of the Day magazine, Tim Glynn Jones, is such a keen red that he used to run the Shankhill Skinhead, an Old Trafford fanzine. Not forgetting Greg Dyke, the top man at the Beeb, who is so fond of the club that he used to be a United director and has spent the past few weeks trying to call in a few favours on his programme's behalf. </p> <p>United haters, of course, may not be so troubled by the silence. And even United fans would presumably prefer a testy grump who wins everything rather than a media darling who wins nothing. </p> <p>So how much does the disagreement between Ferguson and the Beeb really matter? Compared to Kosovo, Gaza and the state of the nation's transport infrastructure, not a lot. But the spat is symptomatic of a rapidly changing relationship be tween those playing and those reporting on football that has serious implications. </p> <p>For Ferguson is not alone in being in dispute with sections of the media. While few have gone quite as far as the former Dundee United chairman Jim McLean, who is under police investigation for an alleged incident with a BBC reporter, there are plenty of others grinding axes. </p> <p>The Manchester City manager Joe Royle still refuses to conduct post-match press conferences if anyone from the Liverpool Echo is present, because of what he describes as a vendetta against him when he was Everton manager. Duncan Ferguson has not spoken to a single journalist since he felt the press gloated at his prison sentence for head-butting an opponent. </p> <p>While there are many in the game who remain open, helpful and polite - it would be hard to find any journalist with a bad word for Jim Smith or Gareth Southgate, for instance - sulks and silences, spats and scraps are becoming ever more regular. One seasoned football reporter reckons that, in 20 years' experience, he has never known an atmosphere as tetchy as the present one. For fear of losing access, he believes, many of his colleagues have become cowed, sycophantic and simply dare not ask the challenging question. The possibility of forming mature relationships with managers or players is a thing of the past. </p> <p>\"Trust,\" he says, \"simply does not exist in football any more.\" </p> <p>The connection may not be obvious but all this is tied up with Middlesbrough launching their own website this week, with Chelsea publishing their own magazine and with Manchester United appointing a director of communications. Clubs are fighting for complete control of the lines of information. They want to communicate directly with their fans without interference from an independent third party, the press. Increasingly, if players and managers have something to say, they say it not via the established media but in club magazines, serialised autobiographies or on their own websites. </p> <p>And why not, the clubs will ask. If there is no trust left, whose fault is that? Newspapers devote huge amounts of space to what is known in the dressing room as \"slaughtering\" players: in the tabloids it is stories about their private lives, in the broadsheets (including this one) it is speculative analysis of their characters. Arsenal's Thierry Henry probably spoke for many when, at the launch of his new website recently, he said his motive was primarily to ensure his fans got the story he wanted them to hear, unfiltered by the distorting prism of the media. </p> <p>But there is something else at work here. There is a widespread assumption in football that the media is making an unjustified killing out of the game, that money is pouring into the pockets of journalists, photographers and broadcasters which rightly belongs to the players, managers and chairmen. The lure of the personal website has as much to do with the financial implications of being able to market a player's image as it does with freedom of information. </p> <p>Money certainly seems to have been at the root of a one of football's longest-running battles between Michael Knighton, when he was chairman of Carlisle United, and the local paper, the News and Star. </p> <p>\"He was very sensitive of criticism of the club,\" says Keith Sutton, the paper's editor. \"He was very upset when we reported that he claimed to have seen a UFO at a motorway service station but the thing that finally made him see red was when we printed a special souvenir supplement after Carlisle got to Wembley in the Sherpa Van Trophy. He was very jealous of that, felt we were taking money that belonged to him. So he banned us from the stadium. Of course, it didn't work; we took copy from freelancers. Finally he got so fed up with us, he published his own paper called Borders On Sunday. It only lasted four weeks.\" </p> <p>By contrast, on the other side of the Atlantic, sporting franchises a good deal larger than Carlisle United offer the kind of access to players that the British media can only dream of. This is not because the Americans are better disposed to the press but because they are contractually obliged to be available. Players accept that media duties come with their elephantine pay cheques. And team PR officers ensure the arrangement runs smoothly. Here club PRs seem to believe that the most important part of their job is ringing up to challenge opinions offered in match reports (\"when you wrote our full-back has two left feet, were you being entirely fair?\"). </p> <p>In such an environment of distrust, and with commercial pressures rising all the time, rapprochement looks impossible - meaning that balanced, objective coverage of footballing matters may soon become endangered. </p> <p>As for the Match of the Day spat, staggeringly, despite the \u00a373m over four years that the BBC pays to cover the game, it has no contractual pull: interviews on the programme are a matter of informal understanding. And, if anyone at the BBC thinks the dispute with Ferguson will blow over soon, they should take note of what happens in the true home of football . . . </p> <p>Emerson Leao, Brazil's new national coach, took exception to a story about himself in Placar, a popular football magazine. So exercised was he that he vowed never to speak to anyone at the magazine again. That was 15 years ago and he has been as good as his word: the ban stands. In Brazil even the sulks are world class.</p>"
