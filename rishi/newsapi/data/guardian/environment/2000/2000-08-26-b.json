  "<p><strong> 1:</strong> Expect a high degree of peer pressure. There is a lot of anecdotal evidence suggesting that men confined together are more inclined to enforce conformity of behaviour in everything from the suppression of painful emotions to drinking rituals and dress. This makes it harder for women to cope in the locker-room atmosphere of many kitchens, says chef Anthony Bourdain in his new book Kitchen Confidential : 'We considered ourselves a tribe. We had unusual customs all our own...We were truly happy... a band of brothers...' </p> <p><strong> 2:</strong> Don't assume that the atmosphere will necessarily be loud and bullying, however. As in all workplaces, the tone is usually set at the top of the organisation. While many men loathed their days in the Army, many others - including the art critic Brian Sewell - liked it. 'Geoff', a gay former squaddie, says: 'People looked out for each other. I find civilian life much more selfish.' </p> <p><strong> 3:</strong> Go as far as you can, however, not to break the unwritten rules. Avoid publicly highlighting a man's mistakes or failings, says Dan. 'Men are more solicitous of saving each other's face. If a woman says something like, \"You got that wrong, didn't you?\" that sort of communicativeness can be seen as unduly rude.' Similarly, as John Gray says in his book Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus, men are less willing than women to accept friendly advice since it can be construed as suggesting they have been making mistakes. </p> <p><strong> 4: </strong>Recognise that men will generally be more competitive than women. Radio psychiatrist Professor Anthony Clare, author of Men: Masculinity in Crisis, says most depend on their work for self-esteem, and want to be seen as 'strong, competitive, full of drive and ambition... bringing home the bacon, racing up the ladder.' They will be more inclined to put work ahead of day-to-day family commitments and are more likely to cope badly with redundancy. </p> <p><strong> 5: </strong> Avoid displaying signs of weakness in male environments. Even in warfare, space exploration and other extreme situations, men usually want other men to keep those potentially undermining emotions at bay. While women are more inclined to release those feelings openly, men are more likely to turn fear into anger or to translate nervous tension into humour. Telling jokes and playing pranks is a common theme of military life. </p> <p> Next week: How to work in an all-female environment</p>",
  "<p>Wendy Perriam starts work at 6.30am, wearing an old quilted dressing gown, writing her novels by hand in a scrawl and surrounded by pictures of the Virgin Mary and others that have a particular meaning for her. </p> <p>Such themes are central to her lapsed Catholic novels, the fourteenth of which, Lying , came out this summer. A full-time novelist, she is one of a growing number of people who work from home. Left to their own devices, they usually create a different working environment to the one they left behind in the office. </p> <p>But their styles are completely individual. Ruth, a crime writer, worked at the other end of the day when she began writing. 'I found myself getting up at noon and working through to 4am. I had to be able to cut the world out. It just gravitated that way,' she explained. </p> <p>And Val McDermid, best-selling author of Killing the Shadows and other gory crime novels, starts at her desk about 9am, but needs to play computer games and find other distractions before the creative juices start flowing a couple of hours later. </p> <p>All three women graduated to writing from more conventional careers - Perriam in advertising, Ruth in teaching and McDermid in journalism. But even though all of them are immensely productive - averaging 14 books each - they would not be welcome in the traditional office. </p> <p>Perriam would have to be locked in a cupboard because of her breach of the dress code; Ruth would be accused of skiving because she arrived late; and McDermid would be quickly fired for misusing company equipment and not devoting all her time to her work. </p> <p>But things are going to change. Business is realising that most workers are more productive when they have some control over their own conditions. And there is also a clear link between a relaxed environment and creativity. The call of 'Eureka' came from the bath, not the desk. Coleridge dreamt the lines of Kubla Khan while asleep. And Charles Dickens did much of his writing in the family drawing room as he chatted to friends and played with his children. </p> <p>New businesses are not only recognising the connection between relaxation and creativity, but they are also finding the confidence to trust their employees and relax the old-fashioned rules. Sir Richard Branson is a frontrunner. The casual dress is not just a statement about being modern, it is also about being closer to the creative process. </p> <p>Margaret Briffa, an intellectual property lawyer, swept away decades of convention when she started Briffa &amp; Co in London's Islington five years ago. Unlike traditional lawyers who tend to reduce eye contact in their office seating plans, Briffa's team of eight have arranged their desks in a circle. 'We can discuss things as they come along,' she says. 'This is very good for helping our reaction times. Having to see your boss by going through a door is a barrier.' </p> <p>One of her lawyers is an afternoon and evening person and prefers to start work at lunchtime. She did have reservations about this at first, but now says: 'So long as people do the work, I'm not fussed. And we also have a lot of US business - so it's helpful that he stays later.' </p> <p>The most dramatic thing she did was to encourage her lawyers to bill clients for four hours a day - rather than the six or seven which is almost uniform throughout the rest of the profession. This means that the firm's income is possibly only two-thirds of what it might have been. But Briffa is not so sure about that: 'If you are time-pressured, you cannot take a step back. Taking the stress off ourselves makes us better lawyers. Also, it leads to our getting better business. Our clients tell us things they wouldn't have if they thought they were being charged for the conversation.' </p> <p>Frank Eve, a director of internet mortgage company E-loan, has been able to import some of the flexibility he had when he worked alone to the company's 50-strong team in Redhill. 'There is no monitoring of the hours people do here. If someone wanted to go at 3pm, there would be no checking. But we have found that people have actually been working longer hours here.' In fact, the directors have become anxious about the possibility of some staff working too hard - and they sometimes try to set an example by leaving early. </p> <p>Before joining E-loan, Eve was running a business called Flexemortgage from his home. 'I worked very different hours, depending on what was going on and also on my mood. Flexibility allows an individual to follow their own creativity. If you give people arbitrary rules about working 9 to 5, it is very restricting for people whose most creative time is 10 at night. I was much more creative in that environment than in a traditional office.' </p> <p>Getting the right balance of flexibility and creativity is crucial. Even the most devoted employees will struggle if there are no deadlines or other constraints placed upon them. You only have to look at the high correlation between creativity, flexibility and disaster in the pop world to see why business leaders might be confused. No amount of creativity would recompense them if their staff started behaving like Liam Gallagher. </p> <p>People who have successfully worked alone are usually very disciplined. Eve was no stranger to 16-hour days. Ruth was able to produce a book in two weeks. Perriam puts in six hours of writing a day. McDermid says: 'You have to be even more disciplined if you work on your own.' </p> <p>All beneficiaries of a new-found freedom, none of them would return to the rule-bound environment. 'It wouldn't suit me to go back to a law factory,' says Briffa. 'What killed me as a teacher was knowing what I'd be doing in May next year,' says Ruth. 'I felt shackled, trapped and tied. I hated it.' Perriam says: 'I'd have to wear make-up. You also waste a lot of energy getting there. And then there are all the distractions.' </p> <p>Strangely, however, it is often employees, rather than bosses, who oppose change, says Jan Young, architect, designer and facilitator of change for architect DEGW: 'Creating these changes often means, in practice, giving up your own desk or own base. And many people are resistant to change and say they don't have time for it.'</p>",
  "<p>Numerous shops, restaurants and other businesses in Dublin are advertising in their windows for staff. To fill jobs at high technology companies, Irish recruitment agencies are having to scour the world. </p> <p>The Irish Republic, where emigration was the norm for generations, is now experiencing a severe labour shortage. </p> <p>The Dublin government reckons the country will need to recruit 200,000 skilled workers from overseas in the next seven years. The number of vacant semi-skilled or unskilled jobs is probably even greater. </p> <p>The booming Irish economy, the Celtic Tiger, has already attracted tens of thousands of emigrants to return home. </p> <p>In the year to April 1999, 48,000 people - many of them returnees - entered the country to live, and only 29,000 left. Net immigration since 1995 has totalled 64,000. </p> <p>Many people with no particular family connection to Ireland are also choosing it as their home. A few of the more famous examples are Marianne Faithfull, Rolling Stones singer Ronnie Wood and the BBC's John Simpson. </p> <p>So should you think about joining them? Aside from whether it could enhance your career, do the green hills, golf courses and excellent schools attract you? If they do, it is time to look at the financial prospects. </p> <p>To the casual British visitor, Ireland seems very cheap because the value of the Irish pound, which is part of the euro, has slid to the point where it costs IR\u00a31.22 to buy \u00a31 sterling. Ireland's low corporate taxes have attracted the European bases of some of the largest US companies, particularly in hi-tech industries. </p> <p>If, like Faithfull or Wood you make a living as an artist, a move is worth considering. Artists get generous tax breaks, allowing them to pay no tax at all on most of the income received from their works. </p> <p>But for normal working people, it is wise to look closely at the tax situation, as it is pretty confusing. The top rate of income tax is 44 per cent this year - down 2 per cent on last year. </p> <p>A single person goes on to the top rate after earning only IR\u00a317,000. A married couple with two incomes hits the same rate at double this (they are taxed jointly), but a couple with one income reach this level after IR\u00a328,000. </p> <p>Figures from the Dutch investment bank ABN-Amro confirm that the tax burden on single people is much higher than the UK, except for the low paid. A single person earning \u00a310,000 in the UK pays 16.6 per cent of their pay in tax and National Insurance. </p> <p>The total deductions in the Republic on IR\u00a310,000 would be only 11.6 per cent. So if you want to fill one of the many hotel, restaurant or shop jobs going begging, you could be better off. </p> <p>For skilled workers, how ever, the situation reverses. On IR\u00a325,000, the average pay in the Irish public sector, a single person pays 29.6 per cent in tax and National Insurance against 25.8 per cent in the UK. Moreover, the total deducted from those on \u00a340,000 a year in the UK is 28.3 per cent, compared with 36.1 per cent in Ireland. </p> <p>ABN-Amro concludes that Irish taxes are too high for skilled single people. </p> <p>However, if you are married, and only one of you works, you will probably be better off there due to the generous married couple's allowance. </p> <p>The other crucial thing to bear in mind is that the cost of renting or buying a home in Ireland has sky-rocketed in recent years, so even if your net earnings look good, they could all be dedicated to keeping a roof over your head. </p> <p>However, John Bradley, director of personal financial services at KPMG in Dublin, says: 'We deal with a lot of expats and the reaction I get from UK people is that a lot of them like the lifestyle. It's more laid-back, there's good golf and recreational facilities, and they like the quality of the education'. </p> <p>Whether this is enough to make you overlook paying 44 per cent tax on most of your income is a personal decision. </p> <p>So, these are the factors you should consider before crossing the Irish Sea to live: </p> <p><strong> Tax</strong></p> <p> If you move to Ireland, you will have to pay Irish taxes whether you are paid in the UK or the Republic. But if your income is from other countries, you will pay Irish taxes only on the sums that you actually bring into Ireland. This also means that non-Irish people living there can hold their savings offshore of the UK and Ireland, and not pay Irish tax on them. </p> <p>For those who do have to pay, tax is much higher now in Ireland than in the UK. The good news is that by 2002, when the next Irish general election is due, the standard rate should have reduced by 4 per cent to 20 per cent and the top rate cut by a similar percentage to 40 per cent. </p> <p>The Dublin government, aware that it needs to get more of its people doing paid work, is also moving away from giving a married couple, where only one partner works, an effective \u00a311,000 in extra tax allowances. Single person's allowances are expected to rise. </p> <p>Bear in mind that many indirect Irish taxes are higher. VAT is 21 per cent, compared to the UK's 17.5 per cent. Taxes on buying property, as you will see below, are eye-poppingly high. </p> <p><strong> Property</strong></p> <p> Irish house prices have shot up to the point where houses and flats are all but unaffordable to people on average pay. </p> <p>A three-bedroom house in a pleasant part of Dublin will probably cost in excess of IR\u00a3350,000. Rents too have soared. A two-bedroom Dublin flat can easily cost IR\u00a31,000 a month. </p> <p>The good news is that you do not pay rates or community charges in Ireland, although some councils do make smallish charges for refuse collection and the like. </p> <p>The other good news is that mortgage rates are lower than in the UK. The standard rate is between 4.8 and 4.9 per cent, although the Bank of Scotland is offering 4.19 per cent. </p> <p>You will be severely stung by stamp duties, however. The Irish government charges a whopping 5 per cent on houses worth up to IR\u00a3250,000, 7 per cent on property up to \u00a3500,000 and 9 per cent above that. </p> <p>The property boom has proved to be a good earner for the government. Its other charges include stamp duty on your mortgage, and land registration tax. </p> <p>Lawyers also get in on the act. Dublin solicitors routinely charge 1 per cent of the cost of the property for conveyancing. All in all, it is much more expensive than buying property in the UK. </p> <p>The government is giving tax breaks to encourage landowners to build new homes for sale but, because Ireland is in the euro, it is unable to raise interest rates to cap demand. </p> <p>And - despite the high prices - demand for property has not yet been choked off. </p> <p><strong> Cars</strong></p> <p> Cars are generally more expensive in Ireland than in the UK because of higher taxes, although the manufacturers themselves actually charge less. </p> <p>If you do decide to move, the best option is to take your British-registered car with you, provided you have owned it for at least six months. You will pay no extra taxes on it as long as you do not sell it for at least 12 months after your arrival. </p> <p>You will find that petrol is cheaper than in the UK, which is why there are few petrol stations just north of the Irish border. </p> <p><strong> Health and schools</strong></p> <p> You may curse the failings of the National Health Service until you have to manage without it. Unless you are claiming social security or are a pensioner, you have to pay for each visit to the doctor in Ireland - usually IR\u00a325 per consultation - for dental treatment and for all your medicines, some of which are very expensive. </p> <p>Many employers offer partial, or in some cases total, insurance cover. Childcare in Dublin is cheaper than in London. The charges are more in line with those in the North of England. </p> <p>There is a shortage of nannies and of nursery places, again due to the national shortage of labour. </p> <p>Irish schools, on the whole, are very good, although some parents prefer private education, which has not suffered the same fee inflation as in the UK (see case study). </p> <p>Many state schools are run by the Catholic church.</p> <p><strong> Case study: 'We can't afford a house'</strong></p> <p>Michael O'Loughlin, a screenwriter and novelist, left Ireland in the Eighties and returned two years ago to take advantage of the tax-free earnings for artists. </p> <p>His return was 'not in any way sentimental', he says. 'It was financially pragmatic and to see if Ireland was how I remembered - a laid-back sort of place.' He and his Dutch wife have been shocked, however, by high house prices in Dublin, and disappointed by what they see as the rampant materialism of the newly rich country.</p> <p>'We came back thinking we'd rent for a while and then buy a nice house.' But they cannot afford to buy, and are fed up with the lack of regulation of the rental market, which means landlords can charge what they like, O'Loughlin says. Their 11-year-old daughter is at a private school. The fees are lower than in the UK, but he has found 'it nearly impossible to find a free school that is any good'.</p> <p>Despite the tax break, exile beckons again: 'The advantages of tax exemption are nearly cancelled out by the high cost of property, to the extent that we are thinking of leaving.'</p>",
  "<p>In 1994 my lecture was about broadcasting and politics. My concern then was that the relationship between government and broadcasters was in danger of becoming unhealthy; that as the world of broadcasting was changing broadcasters were always wanting something from the government and, as such, were less likely to be brave in their programming when standing up to the government of the day. </p> <p>I still have that concern - in fact the danger has grown. Broadcasters today want more from government than we could possibly have imagined just six years ago. That is why the government's decision to give the BBC a seven-year licence fee agreement, right through to the end of the current BBC charter, is important. It gives the BBC the freedom and independence to be brave. </p> <p>But tonight I don't plan to talk about politics, I want to talk about change and why it is difficult to bring about in an organisation like the BBC. I believe the stark choice facing the BBC today is that we either change or we simply manage decline gracefully, and none of us joined the BBC to do that. </p> <p>One thing I have learned in my years in the television industry is that money matters when you're trying to make outstanding programmes. I believe one of the problems of BBC television today is that too many of our services have been underfunded. BBC1 certainly needs more money, particularly for drama and quality entertainment, and two of our digital services, BBC Choice and BBC Knowledge, were started without enough money to commission truly original and inspiring programmes. </p> <p>If we want to spend more money on our traditional services, and we do need to, there are certain consequences. First we have to find the money, and second we have to limit our plans for new services to what we can afford. </p> <p>I believe the potential for savings is significant. The BBC currently spends 24% of its income on running the institution of the BBC. Our target is to reduce that figure to 15% over the next three years which will give us an extra \u00a3200m a year to spend on programmes and services if we achieve it. </p> <p>I also believe we can increase our commercial income. </p> <p>The second thing we have to do, if we want better funded services, is to limit our ambitions for expansion. We cannot possibly afford to have a tank on every lawn, or compete in every area of the market place. </p> <p>In this financial year we will be spending \u00a3100m more on programmes than last year. Next year we plan to increase that by a further \u00a3250m above inflation and the year after by another \u00a3130m. That means in the year 2002/3 we will be spending \u00a3480m a year more on our programmes and ser vices than we spent last year - a 30% real increase in programme spend over just three years. This amounts to the biggest increase in programme expenditure in BBC history. </p> <p>So what are we planning to do with the money? </p> <p>We believe that in the age of digital television it will not be sufficient for the BBC to offer only two mixed genre channels which are somehow supposed to meet the needs of everyone. We need a more coherent portfolio of channels. </p> <p>As we are inevitably constrained by money, this means we must limit the size of this portfolio. But there is another more important reason for limiting the number of channels we plan, and that is the principle of universality. What universality means is making all our publicly funded services available in all homes. </p> <p>We must avoid the emergence of a digital underclass, a world where some are information rich while others are information poor. </p> <p>In order to achieve this principle of universality it means we are only going to offer a portfolio of channels now, which, within a reasonable period of time, will be available in every household in the land. The government's proposals for analogue switch-off, possibly in the latter part of this decade, will make this achievable. </p> <p>In practice what all this means is that we believe we should offer a portfolio of seven services across five channels. </p> <p>BBC1 and BBC2 will continue as the mainstays of BBC television for the foreseeable future and be the only BBC channels available in every home until analogue switch-off. </p> <p>Getting these channels right for the future is a big challenge. In the early years BBC1 and BBC2 will still have to be aimed at people who only have analogue television, the majority of homes, until at least 2003. However, over time they will need to evolve to become part of a BBC five channel offering which will eventually be available in every home. </p> <p>BBC1 needs to have a greater impact on people's lives. While this may mean that some old faithfuls disappear and others move from the fringe of BBC1 to peak time on BBC2, it does not mean we are banishing all current affairs, documentaries, religion and arts to other channels. Far from it. But programming in these genres, just as in drama and entertainment, needs to be more engaging, more exciting, more gripping if it is to be on BBC1. </p> <p>Our aim is to make BBC1 the gold standard of mainstream television. </p> <p>All this is going to cost, and we plan a major injection of cash. More than half of the extra money to be spent on the BBC overall will go on improving and modernising BBC1 and BBC2, with most going on to BBC1. Next year alone BBC1's budget will be increased by \u00a395m and the year after by a further \u00a355m, with a lot of this additional money to be spent on drama. </p> <p>Let me move on to BBC2. This is a success story with the channel achieving a higher share of the audience now than it had 10 years ago. But it is also a channel with a split personality. It's the channel of the Open University at the same as being the channel of Gimme Gimme Gimme and the League of Gentlemen. </p> <p>In the long term we plan that BBC2 will increasingly focus on intelligent specialist factual programmes, our key leisure and lifestyle programmes, thoughtful analysis, creatively ambitious drama and comedy, and specialist sports. </p> <p>That won't be for some years, maybe not until analogue switch-off. Until then BBC2 will continue to offer a rich and diverse range of programmes. It will still be the testbed for edgy comedy and entertainment aimed primarily at young audiences, some of which will graduate to BBC1. It will retain, of course, its wide ranging commitment to serious programmes of all kinds. It will also provide a peak time home for some of the programming which is currently shown late night on BBC1. </p> <p>Now for the new channels. Imaginatively we've given them the working titles of BBC3 and BBC4. </p> <p>BBC3 will offer original British comedy, drama and music as well as providing arts, education and social action programming delivered in a way likely to be attractive to a young audience. We've also been piloting a very different sort of news bulletin that breaks many of the conventions of traditional news services. </p> <p>I suspect in developing BBC3 we will need to break a lot more rules before we're through. BBC3 will emerge out of BBC Choice but will have a significantly higher budget. </p> <p>BBC4 will be very different. It will be unashamedly intellectual, a mixture of Radios 3 and 4 on television. </p> <p>It will be based around arts, challenging music, ideas and in-depth discussion. It will be serious in intent but unstuffy and contemporary. It will be a style of television which you can't find anywhere else. We know there's a potential audience, the challenge is to attract it to the channel. </p> <p>I am also very keen for us to deliver a rolling breakfast time business news on BBC4. Just as interest in politics has waned in recent years interest in business has grown. I don't think British television has yet caught up with that. </p> <p>BBC4 will be developed out of BBC Knowledge. But again it will have a significantly higher budget. In all we plan to spend \u00a3130m a year on BBCs 3 and 4. </p> <p>Our fifth channel will be News 24. It seems obvious to me that the world's biggest news gatherer, the BBC, needs a 24 hour news service as part of its channel mix. Increasingly this is how the viewer will watch news. We saw the value of News 24 when reporting the Concorde air crash in Paris. Instead of a news flash on BBC1, we simply switched to the News 24 service. That's the first time that has happened, but it is the pattern for the future. </p> <p>We plan two new children's services to be played in the daytime on the channels occupied by BBC3 and BBC4 in the evenings. One will be for pre-school children and the second for children aged between six and 13. </p> <p>We have done preliminary research on our proposals for BBC3, BBC4 and the children's channels and the response has been very positive. However we cannot go ahead with these without further consulting the public and then seeking the approval of the secretary of state. We plan to do both this autumn. </p> <p>We plan to continue with BBC Parliament on the same basis as now, which means it will be fully available on digital satellite and cable but digital terrestrial homes will only receive an audio signal. </p> <p>Together the channels will deliver the BBC's core aims. All will carry predominantly British original productions. All will make a contribution towards achieving our educational goals which I regard as one of the principal aims of my period as director general. All will include a broad news and current affairs agenda, and all will carry challenging factual programmes. However, over time each channel will develop its own personality and will in creasingly be aimed at particular target audiences. </p> <p>In the digital era I believe the BBC's single most important role will be to make possible the production of great British programmes. </p> <p>Our channel strategy is a means of achieving this - a way of commissioning, producing and broadcasting original British programmes of all kinds on a mix of channels which will make sense to audiences in the digital age. Over time the channels will inevitably change but the commitment to creating exciting British programmes will not. </p> <p>Making television is a cre ative process and if we really aspire to be the engine of a new era of great British production in all genres of programming we have to be able to attract the best talent to work with us. </p> <p>This means creating inside the BBC an environment in which talented people can flourish. </p> <p>My definition of the purpose of the BBC in the digital age is to make and commission great British programmes. Everything else is secondary.</p>",
  "The job does not have a high profile. Nor is it one that normally excites much interest or controversy. But attempts to fill the soon-to-be-vacant post of clerk to the Welsh national assembly have drawn barbed criticism. <p>It is not so much the decision to find a replacement for senior civil servant John Lloyd that has upset the critics as the disclosure that whoever fills the role will pocket a six-figure sum for doing so. </p> <p>Applicants for what is being described as \"a unique UK civil service appointment\" are being tempted with a salary of up to \u00a3127,000 - considerably more than the \u00a369,000 that goes to members of the assembly cabinet and opposition party leaders in Cardiff Bay. </p> <p>Officially, the post is being advertised at \"circa \u00a3100,000\" - only slightly less than the salary to which first secretary Rhodri Morgan is entitled. One Conservative assembly member said the salary being offered was \"obscene\". </p> <p>As clerk, the successful candidate will be directly responsible to the assembly's presiding officer, Dafydd Elis-Thomas, for the provision of a wide range of independent services, including the assembly's library, information and translation services. </p> <p>Bilingual advertisements published in Welsh newspapers this week have emphasised that whoever fills the post will need to have integrity as well as top drawer personal, negotiating and persuading skills. </p> <p>Other qualifications required include direct experience of parliamentary processes, a thorough understanding of constitutional matters, high sensitivity to political issues, and the ability to provide leadership to a complex organisation \"working within an environment of constant change\". </p> <p>Assembly officials are perplexed that attempts to find such a paragon to replace Mr Lloyd on his retirement should have caused surprise, citing the clerk's responsibility for a \u00a320m budget and a staff of 200. </p> <p>\"It is not as if he will be doing the filing and making the tea,\" said an assembly spokesman yesterday. </p> <p>\"Basically the clerk runs the show.\" </p> <p>But the Conservatives remain unimpressed by such arguments. Nigel Evans, the party's spokesman for Wales, claimed that teachers, farmers and nurses would be dumbfounded by the amount on offer. </p> <p>David Davies, Conservative whip in the assembly, was more forthright. \"It's obscene. I can't understand how they can justify that sort of salary for what he does. It's just like the cost of the new building and the cost of translators. Everything connected with the Welsh assembly costs lots of money and delivers little or nothing.\" </p> <p>Former Welsh Office minister, Rod Richards, anxious to escape the assembly and rebuild his political career by finding a safe Westminster seat in England, was a little less scathing. </p> <p>\"It's cost neutral,\" he insisted. \"This is not a new page in wasting government money because it is already happening.\"</p>",

  "<p>In the past few months the ITV network has gone from being managed by three companies to two and from a triumvirate of media barons to just Michael Green of Carlton and Charles Allen of Granada. That, at least, would be the impression of anyone reading the business pages of the national press. That would be right if there was not the small matter of the existence of Scotland. </p> <p>Andrew Flanagan, chief executive of SMG, the former Scottish Media Group, is the ITV tycoon that the Times (and everyone else) forgot. </p> <p>The quietly spoken Glaswegian is at the helm of the company which owns the Scottish Television and Grampian ITV franchises as well as newspapers including the influential Herald and Evening News. </p> <p>He was also the man who made TV and radio presenter Chris Evans a very rich man earlier this year when he agreed to pay \u00a3225m for Ginger Media Group, including Virgin Radio and the production business behind TFI Friday. </p> <p>If Flanagan occupied the same position in England as he does at home he would be considered one of the most powerful media moguls in Britain. </p> <p>Flanagan, 44, claims not to be rattled by the attention given to his better known rivals and gets on with them despite their \"strong views and high self regard\". </p> <p>But if he does not seek the personal limelight then he does bristle over the lack of attention given to SMG. He recalls with some exasperation a conversation with a London advertising executive after the group last year acquired Pearl &amp; Dean, the cinema advertising sales business, for \u00a325m. </p> <p>\"The media sector and the advertising community is very Londoncentric,\" he says. \"It was startling that when we bought Pearl &amp; Dean, which in the round was a pretty small deal, the impact in London was huge. People were saying 'great deal. You've really arrived'. They even started singing the tune down the phone.\" </p> <p>The Pearl &amp; Dean acquisition was a plank in SMG's nascent strategy to take on England's media community in its own backyard. </p> <p>The change of name for the company to veil its roots was a reflection of the growing percentage of business it is now doing outside Scotland. </p> <p>The business has grown in value fourfold in the past five years from a position where it was a single ITV franchise, Scottish Television. In 1996, Herald publisher Caledonian was bought, a year later Grampian was added followed by Pearl &amp; Dean, outdoor poster group Primesight, a larger slice of GMTV and Ginger. </p> <p>\"Scotland is a great place but too many Scottish companies fall into the trap of thinking we have a nice life, we are profitable, people leave us alone - and then lo and behold they are taken over. You have to keep moving. </p> <p>\"When I joined it was at the first round of consolidation in 1994 and people said why bother you'll be taken over within five weeks. If you keep focused on your own strategy and keep running fast then it is difficult for a predator.\" </p> <p>The determination to keep deal-making was underlined last week when the group raised a further \u00a345m from a share placing to give it the flexibility to pounce when opportunities arise. </p> <p>The Ginger deal was the largest so far and if Pearl &amp; Dean caught Londoners' attention then the notoriety of Chris Evans was a smack in the face. </p> <p>As well as the national radio licence it made SMG the sixth largest TV programme maker in Britain, building on its own productions including detective series Taggart and game show Wheel of Fortune. </p> <p>TFI Friday is now in its last season but Channel 4 has commissioned Evans to come up with a replacement vehicle. Ginger production the Priory, meanwhile, has been recommissioned and the company is working on its first feature film with Sky. </p> <p><strong> Ginger whingers</strong><br> </p> <p> The Ginger deal drew fierce criticism from, among others, SMG's largest shareholder, Granada. Flanagan says much of the criticism stemmed from a lack of understanding of the Ginger business. \"People thought we were paying \u00a3225m for a TV presenter but we weren't. We were paying for a business with good fundamentals.\" </p> <p>Evans is locked in for a number of years but, Flanagan notes, the value of the business would not collapse without him. \"When he left Radio 1, they replaced him with Zoe Ball and listening figures didn't fall.\" </p> <p>He also says the brickbats stemmed from a resentment that Evans should personally make \u00a375m from the takeover. \"There was the feeling that it was somehow unfair that Evans should make all that money. But he made a good decision to invest when he did and he got a fair return.\" </p> <p>There are, he says, three Evans. The TV and radio personality, the off-duty lad who plays up to the excess image and the serious, level-headed man with a shrewd eye for an investment. \"The latter is probably closest to the real Chris Evans,\" he says. </p> <p>While the aim is to expand the group's horizons, the ingrained attitudes of advertisers who disfavour Scotland still grate. \"Scotland's economics are on a par with the UK average and disposable in come is quite high because accommodation and travel costs are lower. But in ITV terms we get 10% of viewer share and only 6% of advertising by value. Why is a viewer in Norwich worth more than a viewer in Edinburgh? It's ridiculous,\" he says. </p> <p>\"The Herald outsells all the English broadsheets put together in Scotland but Scottish papers get only 2% of national display advertising. Why is that the case? </p> <p>\"People in advertising think they've got national coverage if they use the English papers and that's not true. But the decision is made in London.\" </p> <p>If Scotland were a separate country then multinational advertisers, such as Unilever or Ford, would assign it an individual marketing budget instead of leaving spending decisions in the hands of the Soho crowd, he points out - although he is on record as being ambivalent about a fully independent Scotland. </p> <p>\"It's not that I find it patronising. It's just a situation that exists,\" he says before launching into another commentary which suggests he does not feel the equanimity he would like to suggest. </p> <p>\"You do sometimes feel miffed. People in London think Capital Radio is the number one station but north of Birmingham no one has heard of it. Virgin is a national brand but there again is this Londoncentric mentality.\" </p> <p>Flanagan was born in the east end of Glasgow into what he describes as a \"modest but very stable\" environment. His father was a traffic controller for British Rail and his mother worked as a book keeper. </p> <p>After attending the local school and university - \"a very traditional west Scotland thing to do\" - he decided to see the world. </p> <p>Not for Flanagan, though, the haze of late 1970s Goa or bumming around in Australia but the prudent option of Brussels - where he worked for seven years as a management consultant. </p> <p>Flanagan is part of the new breed of media tycoon less interested in trophy assets than he is in running businesses. </p> <p>After working with a series of compa nies in computing and telecoms he switched over to work in-house for some of his clients - a walking advertisement for the convergence of IT, telecoms and media before anyone ever thought of it. He did stints at ITT and cable operator Nynex before being lured back to Scottish TV as finance director in 1994. </p> <p>He says he had never intended to end up back in Glasgow and assumed his career would continue in London. He is critical of another Scottish national working in the media and living in the capital for losing touch with the feelings of the Scottish population - Andrew Neil. </p> <p>Flanagan scoffs at Neil's stewardship of Herald rival, the Edinburgh-based Scotsman. </p> <p>\"The Scotsman is a fantastic brand but Andrew Neil has alienated the readership because his views are quite right wing and very unionist in the context of a Scotland which is slightly left of centre and which is going through devolution which some 70% of people voted for. His views jar and the paper has lost its position. </p> <p>\"It's fine having strident views but at the same time you have to be in tune with your readership. That is why they began price cutting, which is hugely expensive and has had hardly any impact on our circulation. </p> <p>\"They are selling at 20p, the Herald is at 48p and we have lost maybe 3,000.\" </p> <p>The group's latest publishing venture is the Sunday Herald, which has established a circulation of 55,000, putting it behind only Scotland on Sunday and the Scottish edition of the Sunday Times. </p> <p><strong> At arm's length</strong><br> </p> <p> A sense of detachment from the London-based media fraternity is a common theme. Even the appeal of Big Brother has passed him by. </p> <p>\"Maybe it's that I find that kind of voyeurism a little disconcerting but I also have no empathy with any of the people because I would never have put myself through that kind of situation.\" </p> <p>He shrugs off any hint of inevitability that SMG or at least its ITV assets will be subsumed into a single ITV company controlled by either Granada or Carlton. </p> <p>\"Scotland and Northern Ireland [which is served by the still independent Ulster Television] sit slightly apart. People in Scotland don't talk about ITV, but about Grampian and Scottish - so we pretty much sit at arm's length. </p> <p>\"The reality is that when people are talking about a single ITV they are talking about England and I don't think it is at all inevitable that we will end up as part of that - although it is possible.\"</p>",
  "<p>There are moments when I think, \"God, don't we have enough damned cookery books?\" I look up at my shelves bent under the weight of them: so many volumes, so many recipes, so many ideas. How many do I turn back to? How many do I use? How many do I love? Can there be anything to say that hasn't been said before? </p> <p>And then I pick out one at random, flick the pages, pause, my eye caught by a photo, recipe or chapter head, a gravy stain from a previous time when I'd taken it down. Soon, I am drawn into the dream world that cookbooks and food books weave about us. </p> <p>It has taken me a long time to realise that you don't have to cook to enjoy cookery books. It may even be better if you don't. Too often, the gap between the dream of the recipe, or the perfection of the picture, and the domestic version is too great for peace of mind. It is quite possible to derive immense sensuous pleasure from the simple business of looking and reading, to cook the recipe in your imagination, the result unblemished by personal shortcomings and untidy reality. </p> <p>However, any food or cookery book should enlarge your pleasure in eating and, at their best, will inspire you to cook, so here is a short selection of newish releases that, hopefully, might encourage both.</p> <p> <strong> Good Things In England, by Florence White</strong> <br> (\u00a310, Persephone Books)</p> <p> \"By 1928 I found I had struck a rich line of research... I founded the English Folk Cookery Association that year; but very few subscribing members were secured, English cookery was so much under a cloud that people might have paid a subscription to keep out of it.\" Plus \u00e7a change - but clearly Florence White was not a woman to be discouraged by such a minor setback, and this book is the result of her researches and of her spirit. First published in 1932, it is a marvellous compendium of recipes, as important a repository of our culture as Cecil Sharp's collection of English folk tunes. Minnow tansies, saucer pies, roasted cygnets, fag pie and Mrs Comber's sauce... they are all here, with sources properly acknowledged and recipes that are models of brevity and point. A true marvel. </p> <p> <strong> River Cafe Cook Book Green, by Rose Gray and Ruth Rogers</strong><br> (\u00a330, Ebury Press)</p> <p> At the other end of the universe from Florence White's treasure trove, but curiously similar in the tone of the prose, signore Gray and Rogers deal with food matters with admirable crispness. The recipes are sharp and clear, working in direct contrast to the superlatively seductive photographs of Martin Gray. The anticipatory greed created by the images gives you the courage to attempt the recipes. The degree to which they work, however, will depend on the quality of the ingredients to which you have access. That is axiomatic of all cooking, and of Italian cooking in particular. At the River Cafe, they bring in the best and freshest stuff straight from source. Sadly, the equivalent ingredients at your friendly supermarket down the road won't deliver the same oomph. Minimum guff, maximum price. Still, you can feast in your mind and start saving to go to Italy itself (or the River Caf\u00e9). </p> <p> <strong> Scots Cooking, by Sue Lawrence</strong><br> (\u00a318.99, Headline) </p> <p> You suspect there is only one book in Scots cooking, and this is it - from Aberdeen rowies to white puddings, by way of ham and haddie, potted hough and raggy biscuits. There may not be much strength in depth to Scots cooking, but what there is is magnificent, rich, potent and profoundly comforting. The recipes are splendidly clear, the provenance and cause for each put forward with brisk clarity, along with many references to various aunts, uncles and other members of the Lawrence family, all of whom seem to have splendid, heart-warming greed in common. </p> <p> <strong> Soup Simply Sensational, by Matthew Drennan</strong><br> (\u00a316.95, Aquamarine) </p> <p> Simply silly title for a surprisingly good book. Some old recipes - avgolemono, gazpacho, ribollita; some new - roasted aubergine and courgette with tzatziki, summer herb with char-grilled radicchio, chicken and crab noodle with coriander omelette. None seems unduly complicated, and Drennan has an interesting take on turning traditional main courses into soups - viz Irish country soup, braised cabbage soup with beef and horseradish cream, soup of Toulouse sausage with borlotti beans and breadcrumbs, and roast vegetable medley with sun-dried tomato bread - but his tome is a little on the expensive side. </p> <p> <strong> A Kitchen In Burgundy, by Anne Willan</strong><br> (\u00a325, Cassell) </p> <p> A la Recherche du Temps Culinaires: this book is a personal memoir of the Chteau du Fay, which became the home of Anne Willan's family, and of rural Burgundy, where it is situated. While the prose is of the head-girl, no-nonsense variety, Langdon Clay's pictures reek of nostalgia for the kind of France and French food we would like to think we remember. The recipes seem amiable enough, but the pictures and the mood are the thing. One for dreams rather than the beastly realities of everyday life. </p> <p> <strong> A Wolf In The Kitchen, by Lindsey Bareham</strong><br> (Penguin, \u00a39.99) </p> <p> A late arrival, garlanded with pukkas from the generous Jamie Oliver. A compendium of Bareham's recipes from the Evening Standard. Sensible, accessible, eminently munchable. Not so much madcap inspiration, more (and more valuable for it) a warm and reliable friend in the kitchen. How she manages to keep up the enthusiasm, productivity and, er, standards beats me, but she does, and thousands of daily domestic kitchens are the happier for her. </p> <p><strong> American red bean soup with guacamole salsa</strong></p> <p> From Soup Simply Sensational, pictured left. Serves six. </p> <p>For the soup </p> <p><strong> 30ml olive oil <br> 2 onions, chopped  2 garlic cloves, chopped  2 tsp ground cumin  tsp cayenne pepper  1 tbsp paprika  1 tbsp tomato puree  tsp dried oregano  400g can chopped tomatoes  2 x 400g cans red kidney beans, drained and rinsed  900ml water  Salt and ground black pepper  Tabasco to serve</strong> </p> <p>For the salsa </p> <p><strong> 2 avocados <br> 1 small red onion, finely chopped  1 green chilli, seeded and finely chopped  1 tbsp chopped fresh coriander  Juice of 1 lime</strong> </p> <p>Heat the oil in a large, heavy-based saucepan, and add the onions and garlic. Cook for four to five minutes, until softened. Add the cumin, cayenne and paprika, and cook for a minute, stirring continuously. Stir in the tomato pur\u00e9e, cook for a few seconds, then stir in the oregano. Add the chopped tomatoes, kidney beans and water. </p> <p>Bring to the boil then simmer for 15-20 minutes. Cool the soup slightly, then pur\u00e9e it in a food processor or blender until smooth. Return to the rinsed-out saucepan and add seasoning to taste. </p> <p>To make the salsa, halve, stone and peel the avocados, then dice them finely. Place in a bowl and mix in the red onion, chilli, coriander and lime juice. </p> <p>Reheat the soup and ladle into bowls. Spoon a little salsa into the middle of each and serve, offering Tabasco to those who want to spice it up. </p> <p><strong> Tuna carpaccio with chili</strong></p> <p> From River Cafe Cook Book Green. Serves six. </p> <p><strong> 4 fresh red chillies, washed <br> 1.5kg tuna loin, trimmed of skin and sinew  Maldon salt and fresh ground black pepper  Juice of 3 lemons  200g wild rocket leaves, washed  Extra-virgin olive oil  2 lemons, cut into wedges</strong> </p> <p>Preheat a griddle pan to very hot. Cover a board with a mixture of sea salt and ground black pepper. Roll the tuna loin in this to crust the surfaces with a thick layer. Place the loin on the hot grill and seal briefly on all sides. The salt and pepper should cook into the surface, making a coat. The flesh should remain raw. Leave to cool completely. </p> <p>Cut the chillies in half lengthways. Scoop out the seeds and then slice across as finely as possible. </p> <p>Using a large, sharp, thick-bladed knife, kept damp with a wet cloth, cut very thin slices from the tuna loin. Wet the knife each time you make a slice. </p> <p>Arrange enough slices of tuna to completely cover each plate in one layer. Sprinkle over the chilli, squeeze on plenty of lemon juice and season generously with salt and pepper. Place a few rocket leaves on to each plate of carpaccio. Drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil and serve with a wedge of lemon. </p> <p><strong> Jugged pigeons</strong></p> <p> From Good Things In England - an 18th-century recipe from Worcester. Detailed measurements don't seem to have been Ms White's strong point - I'd go for a pigeon per person. </p> <p><strong> Pigeons <br> Hard-boiled eggs  Nutmeg  Pepper  Salt  Breadcrumbs  Suet  Sweet herbs  Lemon peel  Water, 1 pint  Onion, 1  Sweet herbs in a bundle  Beer, 1 glass  Flour and butter</strong> </p> <p>Pluck and draw the birds. Boil the livers, chop them finely and make a stuffing with them, some yolks of hard-boiled eggs, nutmeg, pepper, salt, breadcrumbs, finely chopped suet, powdered sweet herbs, lemon peel all mixed together. </p> <p>Stuff the birds and put them into a jug with a pint of water, the onion, a bundle of sweet herbs, and beer. Put the jug into a pot over the fire and stop your jug closed. </p> <p>Let them stew until tender (depends on age - at least two hours) and strain off the gravy. Put 1oz butter into a saucepan, melt it, add 1oz flour, brown both together. Dilute with a pint of the broth, boil up and pour over the pigeons. Serve up garnished with pickles. </p> <p><strong> Cranachan</strong></p> <p> From Scots Cooking. Serves six. </p> <p><strong> 125g jumbo oats <br> 75g light muscovado sugar  250g mascarpone cheese  3-4 tbsp malt whisky, plus extra to serve  300ml double cream, lightly whipped  250g raspberries  Runny heather honey (optional)</strong> </p> <p>Put the oats and sugar on a large sheet of foil and place under a hot grill for three to four minutes, stirring every 30 seconds or so - they burn quickly, so watch carefully. </p> <p>Remove and leave to cool. Put the mascarpone in a bowl, add the whisky and beat until smooth. Fold this into the whipped cream, along with the cooled oat mixture. </p> <p>Once thoroughly combined, gently fold in the raspberries, taking care not to break them up. Tip into a glass bowl, cover and serve at once, or chill for no more than an hour. Offer an optional drizzle of whisky and heather honey, if you like.</p>",
  "An American advertising copywriter whose chance encounter with a piano restorer in Paris spurred him to write his first book at the age of 55 heads the longlist of nominations for the Guardian First Book Award 2000. <p>TE Carhart's The Piano Shop on the Left Bank is a partly autobiographical exploration of the history, mechanics and cultural relevance of the piano, inspired by a visit to a secluded Paris atelier where he met Luc, an enigmatic piano restorer whose musings on the individual nature of the instruments and the music they produce reawakened Carhart's love of the instrument. </p> <p>By contrast Trezza Azzopardi, whose novel The Hiding Place is among the 10 contenders for the award, which is open to fiction and non-fiction writers of all nationalities, was \"discovered\" while attending a creative writing course at the University of East Anglia. </p> <p>Azzopardi acquired an agent and a publisher after writing the first chapter of the novel, the story of the tangled life of a family of a Maltese immigrant in Cardiff's Tiger Bay, as part of the course. </p> <p>Azzopardi's themes of migration, the search for identity and the exposure of a little known historical episode, in her case the fate of the Maltese diaspora, are also present in several of the other works on the list. </p> <p>Zadie Smith's acclaimed and massively successful White Teeth, an account of a mixed race family in north London, is longlisted, as is Catfish and Mandala by Andrew X Pham, a Vietnamese-American. </p> <p>Part travelogue, part autobiography, Pham's book recounts his return to the country his parents left as boat people in the 1970s. </p> <p>There are three other non-fiction works on the list. A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius is the remarkable memoir of Dave Eggers, an American whose parents died when he was 21, leaving him to raise his eight-year-old brother. </p> <p>No Logo by American journalist Naomi Klein examines the culture of protest that has grown up against the ubiquity of global brands and the power of capital, epitomised by the violent protests that greeted the World Trade Organisation summit in Seattle earlier this year. </p> <p>Perhaps most interesting is Ubiquity by Mark Buchanan, a physicist who takes the chaos model and applies it to history and politics, arguing that the old sores of causality and consequence are redundant. </p> <p>Three novels complete the list. House of Leaves by Mark Z Danielewski is a postmodern take on the horror genre, employing numerous typographical tricks including several typefaces, upside down text and pages with just a single word on them. </p> <p>Beautiful Disguises by Rajeev Balasubramanyam is the tale of a young Indian girl infected by Audrey Hepburn fantasies and dreams of Bollywood success. </p> <p>Douglas Galbraith's The Rising Sun, a historical seafaring tale of a Scottish voyage to the jungles of Panama, is perhaps the most orthodox of the debut novels. </p> <p>Claire Armitstead, Guardian literary editor and chairwoman of the judging panel, which will include Kirsty Young, Prof Steve Jones, David Baddiel and Julian Barnes, hailed the breadth and ambition of the longlisted titles. \"The thought on our minds as we worked through the 120 submissions was whether we would find a voice for the new millennium. In fact we found many voices.\" </p> <p>The shortlist will be announced in October and the winner, who receives \u00a310,000 and an advertising campaign in the Guardian, in December. </p> <p><b>The ten</b></p> <p><b> Title: The Hiding Place</b> (Picador \u00a314.99) <br> Sisters gather in the Cardiff docklands for their mother's funeral.

  "<p>There is surely a revealing thesis to be written, at a radical faculty of psychology somewhere or other, on the clinically devised game of one-day cricket as practised by Gloucestershire. </p> <p>They, and in particular their coach John Bracewell, have quietly revolutionised it, dispensing illogical shocks and sweeping away the cobwebs to reach an historic fourth successive Lord's final against Warwickshire in the NatWest Trophy today. </p> <p>Gloucestershire are far from the best side in the country. Yet with an astute formula that takes into account everything from the quirks of the psyche and Jack Russell's cherished baked beans to individual strengths and flaws, they have outfought and frightened the life out of opponents whose sides are stacked with more illustrious names. </p> <p>Bracewell, 42, the tall, lean Kiwi who patrols the outfield during a county match looking like a middle-aged venture scout in shorts he has outgrown, is eternally vibrant with new ideas, paternal common sense and striking phraseology. He talks about one of Gloucestershire's first finals under him: \"Of the awe in actually being there, the excitement, the butterflies flying in unison.\" </p> <p>One of four cricketing brothers who himself played in 41 Tests, he was known at home for his high-action off-spinners that attacked the batsmen rather than contained their scoring; for his extrovert traits and the ambitious glint that suggested one day he hoped to be the national coach. </p> <p>He remains extrovert, ready with a contentious view when he thinks it is justified - just ask Worcestershire, who still feel hard done by that Gloucestershire were given a second shot at them after they played an unqualified bowler - and is probably the most articulate, intrepid, single-minded coach on the domestic circuit. </p> <p>\"Competitive, me? I'd rather you called me passionate. I like fighting causes, championing the underdog. I've socialist tendencies. In another age I'd probably have been a martyr or, at the turn of the previous century, a union representative. I think all coaches should be socialists, you know - they should have the interests of the team first and how all the parts make up that team. If the coach only concentrates on individuals who are statistically successful, then he'll run into trouble.\" </p> <p>It is not usual to be given political or social treatises in the context of cricket. But then he returns to today's game: \"We have players particularly equipped for the one-day game. Many of them are frustrated footballers. They throw themselves around in the field. All I've done is create the environment for learning. I take a great pride in the sharing of knowledge.\" </p> <p>His approach encompasses diet and discipline. He discourages too much drinking. He doesn't like mickey-taking (\"it's a belittling kind of humour\"). He denies he is a martinet: \"I get the players to set the standards - I tell them the rules are theirs not mine.\" </p> <p>The players occasionally exchange looks as he comes up with another theory or drives them relentlessly in exercise. Mike Smith, one of the more experienced players, says: \"John is intense, determined. He certainly doesn't like losing. He'll be treating any attempts at a wind-up by Bob Woolmer very seriously indeed.\" Chris Taylor, in his first season, says: \"He has been very encouraging to me as a newcomer. The advice he gives is very much on an individual basis.\" </p> <p>Bracewell argues that he has the bonus of an outstanding one-day captain in Mark Alleyne: \"He has a natural instinct for it.\" But every member of the team will be studiously told what he has to do within Gloucestershire's formula. \"The guys are prepared to switch and change to fit in.\" </p> <p>Many thought Bracewell would have gone by now, back to New Zealand as their coach. It looks as though his contract will be extended at Bristol, however. \"I'm still only an apprentice, making my way and making notes as I go. To be honest, I'm a bit afraid of becoming a national coach, not sure I'm quite ready.\" </p> <p>He says he gave up playing in 1990 because he did not want to be an absentee parent. He did not want to keep on touring. Now his children are being educated in Bristol. \"For the time being I'm keen to attend their school concerts and see them playing games.\" </p> <p>Bracewell refutes any suggestion that he prefers to concentrate much of his energy and thinking on the one-day game. \"My long-term aim is for Gloucestershire to win the championship - they just have to add something to their mental attitude.\" In the short term it is likely they will want to bat first - though 12 out of the past 13 finals have gone to the team batting last - and for Tim Hancock and Kim Barnett to race away in the style that has served them so well. </p> <p>By contrast, it is hard to know what has been going through Bob Woolmer's mind. Has the homecoming to Warwickshire been as embracing and reassuring as he would have liked? He, too, is talented, fluent in conversation, with plenty of opinions. When he was previously at Edgbaston, the silverware bulged from the cabinets. Brian Lara was hitting 500 runs in an innings, Dermot Reeve was winding up opponents and motivating his players, who in turn were winning almost everything going. </p> <p>Woolmer badly needs to recruit additional talent as much as he needs the psychological lift of a win today. Soon Allan Donald, capable of making an aggressively crucial Lord's exit, will be gone - and no doubt Ed Giddins, too, if as seems likely he moves back south. </p> <p>There has also been some anxiety over the captaincy. Woolmer appears to wonder whether Neil Smith should be automatically assured of a place when another slow bowler, Ashley Giles, is around? Is Smith, doubtless desperate to do well today, reliable enough from down the order as a batsman in championship matches? </p> <p>Warwickshire still have match-winners and players who can respond to the glamour of the occasion. They also need overdue restored status. But it does look as though Gloucestershire, those west country upstarts, are at least ahead in the mind games.</p>",

He had a sample of aniline distillate of coal tar, the gunky waste from the manufacture of gas for street-lighting from which his tutor had been synthesising organic compounds, and he hoped to transmute it into quinine, the treebark-derived anti-malarial drug essential to empire. Instead, he obtained a sludge containing five per cent of a colouring matter which, separated out for want of anything else to do with it save clog the drains, stained a silk cloth lustrous purple. </p> <p>His discovery was the first true synthetic dye, mauveine; after it, dye creation became the basis of industrial chemistry, which revealed in time the molecular structures of nitro-glycerine, aspirin, sulpha drugs, petro-plastics, and even the quinine substitute mepacrine, which tinted the skin yellow as it warded off malaria. Perkins retired, moderately prosperous, at 36, by which time the chemical output of united Germany dominated the world. </p> <p>That is Garfield's plot, and not much compressed from his shilling-life job in Mauve, one of those single-subject books with Longitude-inous pretensions that are this season's hot shade in publishing. It's a volume prepared to a precise formula of success, personal and national, won and forgotten; pages of toasts and menus from mauve-tie dinners honouring Perkins; interviews with \"fashion experts\"; plus a gramme or two of chemistry and literary references. </p> <p>And all as monotone, as flat, as mauveine: Garfield seems not to be really interested in fashion, that acute social desire for the unnecessary. He reports that the printworks of mid-19th century Europe were desperate for economic, simple dyes, but he does not begin to connect with the huge truths about how much the Industrial Revolution had been activated by the coal-fuelled, steam-driven spinning and weaving of cotton, the manufacture of a fibre grown cheaply outside Europe into an unprecedented yardage of textiles at moderate prices.</p> <p>Just as washable white cotton underclothes - their brilliant blanching effected by chlorine bleach, an early application of chemistry to cloth - popularised cleanliness, so dyed and printed cotton goods democratised fashion, since all but the poorest could afford to change style more frequently than ever before. </p> <p>Garfield seems colour-blind, too, unable to see it as the essential signifier of the mood of place and time. He writes that mauve - named from the French for mallow flower - took off because the empress of France, Eugenie, decided that the colour, in a natural version brewed from lichen, matched her eyes. (In regal imitation, Queen Victoria wore a mauve gown.)</p> <p>But lilacs, violets and pansies had been the sentimentally meaningful flowers of the 1840s, while art went through a seriously purple passage in the 1850s, with many a dollop in Pre-Raphaelite paintings: Ford Madox Brown used lavender for remembered hills and bonnet bows alike. Mauve was penitential purple domesticated, sad enough to be adopted as quarter-mourning in the subtle gradations of 19th-century grief, sober enough to be permitted for the waistcoats of gentlemen who had otherwise come over all monochrome in response to the era of urban commerce. </p> <p>Not the waistcoats of gentlemen of artistic taste, of course: Garfield alludes to unhealthy aspects of the new colours, to the allergies and arsenic poisoning, but not to the refusal of aesthetic fellows, observed in a Punch illustration of 1877, to \"go down to suppah with a young lady who could wear mauve twimmings in her skirt and magenta wibbons in her hair\".</p> <p>The all-too-visible 1860s triumph of mauve's aniline siblings (fuschsine, alizarin crimson etc) drove William Morris to empurple his arms in the indigo vat and madder pot, since, as he wrote, natural dyes \"can be modified and toned without dirtying, as the foul blotches of the capitalist dyer cannot... these colours in fading remain beautiful, and never... pass into nothingness, through that stage of livid ugliness which distinguishes the commercial dyes as nuisances\". </p> <p>That quotation (and the sharp remark that follows it, that Morris was actually \"a humbug\" who discreetly printed his chintz daffodils in aniline yellow) comes from Robert Chenincer's Madder Red, a book of a very different colour. Modish publishing it is not: more a printed website linking everything the author found during decades of passion for the Caucasus, carpets, and the once financially important cultivation of scrubby, groundcreeper madders, the roots of which contain 25 natural hydroxyanthraquinone colourants. </p> <p>There cannot be a fact about madder, and most other animal or vegetable dyes, not covered extensively within: the 1846 Moscow price of Dutch krap (powdered madder); Spartan battle dress dyed scarlet to hide bloodstains; recipes for garnet, terracotta and other incarnadined hues, plus the knowhow for recreating Imperial Roman Tyrian purple from murex shellfish. It needs putrefying molluscs' meat to brew up - a jar of cockles will do the trick. Natural dyeing is olfactorily organic as well, requiring rancid sesame seed oil, stale piss, sheeps' blood, crottin de mouton or dog excrement. </p> <p>Chenincer is an undisciplined enthusiast, and the small, grisaille illustrations permitted by his academic publishers are frustrating - if only he had been robed in sumptuous colour by the British Museum Press, as was Jenny Balfour-Paul's comparable study Indigo, every page pooled with undilute vats of midnight sky. But Chenincer's curiosity makes the book match the vividness of the 5,000-year-old multi-ethnic technique that gave our retinas bandanna scarves, Micmac dyed porcupine quills, and the ferocious Turkey red cottons that take a generation of summer suns to fade to a fine pink.</p> <p>After reading about George Field, Georgian supplier of \"liquid rubiate\" to J M W Turner - rude roots from Dutch marshes tinted Turner's sunsets - or the anonymous Jewish dyers of Central Asia binding bundles of silk yarn to create the cloud bands of ikat kaftans, I had to cover my eyes. They dazzled. </p> <p>Chenincer's devotion and range of references give him a red surge of power, to plead for the re-establishment of organic dyes as renewable resources, for fewer but better possessions - \"objects of perpetual desire\" created with knowledge and understanding. \"When I look at madder red, my eyes are excited before I know what I am seeing,\" he explains of the Pointilliste effect those 25 variant colouring agents have on every knotted tuft of a madder-dyed Turkish carpet: and he suggests subtly how industrial dyes, remixed constantly in an attempt to shift more garments and wallpaper than we really need, produce desensitised vision in every sense.</p> <p>Oliver Garnett's Colour, done inexpensively for the National Trust, is not much more than a footnote in publishing and polychrome. Old-snobbish, too, citing the Earl of Craven's 11-layered yellow state chariot and Lord Berners dipping his white pigeons and poodle in ultramarine for surreality in the 1930s. But Garnett's eyes are in the right place: how permanently satisfying is the green library of Nina Cust, one of those 19th-century aesthetes called the Souls, the original Greens who preferred the natural in protest against the harsh, smart artifices of the machine age. Cust's green is the exact shade of leaf-reflections: I must ask my dad the housepainter how to mix it.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Tainted by Experience</strong> <br>John Drummond <br>Faber, \u00a325, 384pp <br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502132887,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p><strong> Theatre@Risk</strong> <br>Michael Kustow <br>Methuen, \u00a316.99,288pp<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502437504,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>What kind of cultural life do we want in Britain? One that is diverse, ambitious, internationalist and open to the shock of the new? Or one that is bland, populist, commodified and dominated by management and marketing? Both these books are passionate, rousing defences of the appetite for excellence in a conformist, commercialised age. Far from being snobbish or high-handed, they remind me of the truth of Matthew Arnold's dictum that \"the men of culture are the true apostles of equality\". </p> <p>John Drummond's book is a polemical memoir charting his sometimes erratic ascent through British public life: BBC television's arts department in its golden age, the Edinburgh Festival, Controller of Radio 3 and director of the Proms. What strikes me is his genetic and environmental good luck. The son of a Scottish mariner and an Australian soprano, he inherited a quick intelligence, a restless curiosity, a phenomenal memory. </p> <p>Although brought up modestly in Bournemouth before moving on to the National Service Russian course and Cambridge, Drummond was part of a generation that experienced first-hand the post-war renewal of British artistic life: the Third Programme, cheap paperback books, susidised theatre, opera and ballet. Exactly like contemporaries such as John Tusa, Jeremy Isaacs and Joan Bakewell, he brought to broadcasting and public life firm values and a wide frame of cultural reference: a stark contrast to the modern media brats who seem to know nothing outside the narrow, goldfish-bowl world of television. </p> <p>Drummond was also endowed with the priceless gift of impatience: there's a hilarious moment in the book when a BBC superior apologises for saying of him in a report that \"he does not suffer fools gladly\". Drummond takes it as a compliment but is sternly told: \"Not in the BBC it's not.\"</p> <p>Among the many fools chastised in this book are bone-headed bureaucrats, egotistic conductors (Bernstein especially) and philistine politicians (headed by David Mellor and John Patten). But Drummond's b\u00eate noire is John Birt - for his assault on Reithian values, his reverence for overpaid consultants and his unbelievable management-speak. Asked by Drummond what he thought of BBC orchestras, Birt replied they were \"a variable resource centre whose viability depends on the business plan of the Controller of Radio 3\". </p> <p>Behind Drummond's testiness, however, lies a horror at the vandalisation of a once-great institution and a belief that those placed in positions of power, in broadcasting and the arts, have a mission to inform. Planning a series of architectural programmes for BBC Television, Drummond hired expert presenters such as Alec Clifton-Taylor, John Summerson and Mark Girouard: today, as he wearily says, it's more likely to be Janet Street-Porter.</p> <p>As director of the Edinburgh Festival, Drummond redressed the imbalance between music and drama and achieved thematic unity, as in his unsurpassed \"Vienna 1900\" year. And, as head of Radio 3, he constantly related the speech output to the music, though I'd question his drastic diminution of radio plays. </p> <p>Some might accuse Drummond of paternalism or even - to invoke the silliest of all words - elitism. But this shows the confusion of an age in which a proper scepticism about authority leads to a distrust of all professional knowledge and skill. Drummond, as a confessed generalist, readily admits that throughout life he has learned from people who know more than he does.</p> <p>What he has, as I can testify, is the ability to transmit his own enthusiasms. At one Edinburgh Festival he berated me for rigidly sticking, like all critics, to my own discipline: \"Go to some concerts and opera,\" he advised, \"and tell the Press Office I said so.\" I went that night to hear Simon Rattle conduct Stravinsky, Ravel and Faur\u00e9, and, though I wasn't exactly a musical innocent, I would say Drummond's exhortation changed my life: I have been haunting opera-houses and concert-halls ever since. And, at its best, what this invigorating roller-coaster of a book does, apart from settling old scores, is introduce you to composers who create new ones and remind you of the unending richness of what, with misplaced reverse snobbery, we crudely dub \"high art.\" </p> <p>Michael Kustow is cut from the same cloth as Drummond: having worked at different times for the RSC, the ICA, the National and Channel 4, he is a cultural impresario rather than a creator. His new, vital, vehemently argued book is partly an account of the hectic travails involved in bringing John Barton's epic 15-hour saga about the Trojan war, Tantalus, to theatrical fruition, and partly a highly personal apologia for theatre in an age of global capitalism, technology and cultural relativism. </p> <p>Kustow's book is full of wise saws and modern instances. He reminds us of Britain's debt to the amateur tradition of university drama - \"so rare in other countries\". He compares The Lion King to Inigo Jones's 17th-century masques in which pageantry replaced poetry. And, although his focus is ostensibly narrower than Drummond's, he sees the arts in a wider socio-political context: he not only assails Thatcherite market-driven madness but attends an IT conference in Amsterdam, where he discovers that \"play, the very soil of theatre, is being appropriated by a new breed of designers and gamesters\". </p> <p>What is heartening is that neither of these two books, finally, is apocalyptic. Kustow ends with a richly descriptive and highly moving account of Ariane Mnouchkine's Paris production of Drums on the Dam that embodies the mix of intoxicating theatricality and urgent actuality in which he strongly believes. And Drummond, in a postscript, pays tribute to the wealth of emerging talent in the arts that rejects the gross materialism of the past two decades.</p> <p>The right is always pessimistic: the left is congenitally optimistic. And I too believe that, as human beings, we will eventually crave more than television's steady diet of consumerism and voyeurism, cinema's procession of soul-deadening movies or the transformation of the London theatre into an outer suburb of Hollywood. Taken together, these two books amount to a passionate defence of innovation, authenticity and hand-made excellence in art, and a necessary assault on a prevalent junk culture that denies us real richness of choice.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Something New Under the Sun: An Environmental History of the Twentieth Century</strong> <br>John McNeill <br>Allen Lane, \u00a320, 436pp <br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502441039,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p> According to Douglas Adams in The Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy, the most dastardly instrument of punishment ever invented is the Total Perspective Vortex. This heinous device, a type of virtual-reality machine, plays on the fundamental inadequacies of the human psyche by delivering a precise and irrefutable mental image of a victim's entirely negligible importance in the universal scheme of things, whereupon the poor fellow invariably descends into gibbering madness.</p> <p>The moral? Given the extent to which our brains have been wired by evolution to deal with the universe at minuscule spatial and temporal scales, the very last thing that a human being can afford to own is a sense of perspective. </p> <p>As we enter the 21st century, however, the acquisition of a global and deep sense of temporal perspective seems to offer our last chance of managing Earth to the benefit of our fellows, our children, and all our cousins in the earthly family of life. To achieve this, we must try to understand the long history and slow workings of the planet, the timescales over which it has accommodated change in the past, and the extent to which rapid, human-induced environmental changes might currently be exceeding its ability to cope.</p> <p>Only against the backdrop of history can we evaluate our actions in the present and predict the likely outcomes in the future. It is with this philosophy in mind that John McNeill embarked on his engrossing new book. </p> <p>McNeill's aim is to catalogue the major 20th-century activities of our species and interpret their environmental impact within the broader contexts of human and Earth history. Some of his statistics are quite remarkable. For example, we have probably used 10 times more energy in the last century than our ancestors used in the previous millennium. McNeill will probably not appreciate this admittedly crude, back-of-an-envelope calculation being bandied around by reviewers, but it is such an extraordinary estimate that I suspect he will have to get used to it. </p> <p>In the 20th century, humanity has also moved more rock and soil around the globe than wind, glaciers, mountain-building processes or volcanoes. Only water remains a more significant erosive agent, but with continued growth of the global human population, it will probably not be long before we occupy the top spot. So numerous and powerful have we become in the last 100 years that we now collectively qualify as a geological process, and among the most significant on the planet at that. </p> <p>Similarly illuminating and powerful statistics are set before the reader as McNeill assesses the extent of humanity's recent influence on the Earth's atmosphere, hydrosphere and biosphere. The rate at which mammal species went extinct in the 20th century, for example, was about 40 times higher than \"normal\", while the corresponding figure for birds is nearer 1,000 times greater. Expert opinion varies, but some scientists predict a loss of between a third and a half of the world's terrestrial species in the next century or two. </p> <p>On the basis of these and other worrying estimates, McNeill suggests that we may unwittingly be pushing the biosphere ever nearer to a global mass extinction. Others suspect that we may already be in the midst of one. Will the biosphere, including humans, be able to cope with escalating exploitation of the world's resources and the enormous losses of biodiversity that look set to ensue? No one has the faintest idea. </p> <p>A little exhausted, the reader reaches page 267 of Something New Under the Sun expecting to encounter the index, but instead finds McNeill embarking on Part Two of his treatise, an assessment of the demographic, economic, political and social forces that led to the environmental impacts he has described.</p> <p>Here he is as sure-footed as ever, relating with clarity and insight the underlying reasons for 20th-century population growth, urbanisation, migration, industrialisation, spiralling consumption and manipulation of the Earth's natural resources, and the staggering growth in economic activity that, one way or another, has led to our current somewhat precarious environmental situation. </p> <p>Lest the reader conclude that this book is just another doom-laden environmental rant, it should be pointed out that McNeill's approach to his subject is dispassionate, balanced, and as objective as the source material allows. He is content to chronicle and sensibly evaluate the growth of human influence on the environment in the 20th century, and leave the reader to make up his or her own mind as to the wisdom and likely consequences of our activities.</p> <p>In a field that inspires great passion in its protagonists and frequent polarisation of opinion, Something New Under the Sun is a breath of fresh air. It is also a monumental, important and timely work of interdisciplinary scholarship, written to be accessible to anyone interested in the relationship between our species and the planet that supports us.</p> <p>\u0095 Chris Lavers is the author of Why Elephants Have Big Ears: Nature's Engines and the Order of Life (Gollancz).</p>",
  "John O'Mahoney's devastating critique of Ireland in 2000 (A tiger by the tail, Guardian Review, August 19) reminded me of why I and thousands of twentysomethings like me, left that country during the early 80s, vowing never to return; funerals and weddings excepted. There was the continued feting of a macho drinking culture and it's devastating legacy on families; the crass xenophobia and intolerance (at school I was routinely taught to hate the English, Jews and gays); the breathtaking, casual sexual violence perpetrated against women and children. It's not surprising that even given its renowned wide-open spaces, it was a suffocating environment to grow up in. <p>I'm very saddened but not surprised that the same fault lines and hypocrisies that disfigured Irish society then remain unaddressed. Short-term affluence has surely papered over the cracks, but as John O'Mahoney pointed out, an over-dependence on fickle foreign investment, coupled with a ridiculous Disney-like Oirish identity projected to the world is neither progressive nor realistic. </p> <p>As an expatriate of almost 20 years I perceive the image of Ireland abroad to be peculiarly ambiguous. For all its desire to be seen as a modern European state, it remains as self-obsessed, defensive, and parochial as ever; a culture under siege. I for one, with an Asian partner, couldn't consider returning to such a place.

  "Kicking your heels in an immigration holding-pen can powerfully focus the mind. A few weeks back I flew into Detroit to work with a giant, would-be global car company. <p>As my turn came to speak to the grim-looking immigration officer, he grilled me on who I was working for, how much I was being paid - and whether there weren't American experts who could do the job? </p> <p>I answered the first, told him the second was none of his business and, on the third point, noted that Europe now has something of a competitive advantage in stakeholder engagement processes. </p> <p>He decided I needed a lesson in local power politics. Happily, my luck held: once in the pen, a charming official sped me through the process and wished me God-speed. But the process turned up the amps on a thought-process that had been buzzing around my brain as we crossed the Atlantic. </p> <p>Ahead of the next day's stakeholder process, which I was co-facilitating, I had been reading two recent books on globalisation: Thomas Friedman's The Lexus and the Olive Tree (HarperCollins, \u00a38.99) and A Future Perfect by John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldridge (Heinemann, \u00a320.00). The combination was mind-altering - and should be required reading in anyone's immigration service. </p> <p>One message I had already absorbed from Friedman was that the inevitable backlash to globalisation won't come just from the downtrodden. \"Like all revolutions,\" he says, \"Globalisation involves a shift in power from one group to another. In most countries it involves a power shift from the state and its bureaucrats to the private sector and entrepreneurs. </p> <p>\"As this happens, all those who derived their status from positions in the bureaucracy, or from their ties to it, or from their position in a highly regulated and protected economic system, can become losers - if they can't make the transition to the Fast World.\" </p> <p>It's hard to imagine even the surliest immigration officers being out of work any time soon, particularly in the US, where the country's southern boundaries are under growing pressure from would-be immigrants. But my small contretemps in Detroit further sensitised me to a key theme of the Micklethwait and Wooldridge book: the importance of borders. </p> <p>These, they say, \"are arbitrary abstractions, economic impediments, and surprisingly ineradicable\". It's a paradox that globalisation will force us to think about our borders - economic, social and environmental - as never before. </p> <p>But what most worries these two is the risk that the whole process may still fall flat on its face. They suspect that \"globalisation's psychic energy - the uncertainty that it creates which forces companies, governments, and people to perform better - may have a natural stall point, a moment when people can take no more\". </p> <p>Last year's \"Battle of Seattle\", which shook the World Trade Organization to its roots, was an early warning that the Fast World may be dangerously near some sort of stall point. </p> <p>Whatever immigration officers may believe, countries championing globalisation must lean over backwards to open up their own markets. </p> <p>As Friedman concludes: \"For globalisation to be sustainable America must be at its best - today, tomorrow, all the time.\" </p> <p>Do Americans, do we, realise just how big a challenge this is going to be? </p> <p>\u0095 John Elkington is chairman of strategy consultants SustainAbility (web-site: <a href=\"http://www.sustainability.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">www.sustainability.co.uk</a>) and author of Cannibals With Forks: The Triple Bottom Line of 21st Century Business (Capstone, \u00a312.99).</p>",
  "The job does not have a high profile. Nor is it one that normally excites much interest or controversy. But attempts to fill the soon-to-be-vacant post of clerk to the Welsh national assembly have drawn barbed criticism. <p>It is not so much the decision to find a replacement for senior civil servant John Lloyd that has upset the critics as the disclosure that whoever fills the role will pocket a six-figure sum for doing so. </p> <p>Applicants for what is being described as \"a unique UK civil service appointment\" are being tempted with a salary of up to \u00a3127,000 - considerably more than the \u00a369,000 that goes to members of the assembly cabinet and opposition party leaders in Cardiff Bay. </p> <p>Officially, the post is being advertised at \"circa \u00a3100,000\" - only slightly less than the salary to which first secretary Rhodri Morgan is entitled. One Conservative assembly member said the salary being offered was \"obscene\". </p> <p>As clerk, the successful candidate will be directly responsible to the assembly's presiding officer, Dafydd Elis-Thomas, for the provision of a wide range of independent services, including the assembly's library, information and translation services. </p> <p>Bilingual advertisements published in Welsh newspapers this week have emphasised that whoever fills the post will need to have integrity as well as top drawer personal, negotiating and persuading skills. </p> <p>Other qualifications required include direct experience of parliamentary processes, a thorough understanding of constitutional matters, high sensitivity to political issues, and the ability to provide leadership to a complex organisation \"working within an environment of constant change\". </p> <p>Assembly officials are perplexed that attempts to find such a paragon to replace Mr Lloyd on his retirement should have caused surprise, citing the clerk's responsibility for a \u00a320m budget and a staff of 200. </p> <p>\"It is not as if he will be doing the filing and making the tea,\" said an assembly spokesman yesterday. </p> <p>\"Basically the clerk runs the show.\" </p> <p>But the Conservatives remain unimpressed by such arguments. Nigel Evans, the party's spokesman for Wales, claimed that teachers, farmers and nurses would be dumbfounded by the amount on offer. </p> <p>David Davies, Conservative whip in the assembly, was more forthright. \"It's obscene. I can't understand how they can justify that sort of salary for what he does. It's just like the cost of the new building and the cost of translators. Everything connected with the Welsh assembly costs lots of money and delivers little or nothing.\" </p> <p>Former Welsh Office minister, Rod Richards, anxious to escape the assembly and rebuild his political career by finding a safe Westminster seat in England, was a little less scathing. </p> <p>\"It's cost neutral,\" he insisted. \"This is not a new page in wasting government money because it is already happening.\"</p>",
  "The rolling plains of Anatolia may well have been the place where farming began 10,000 years ago, and millions of Turks still live off the land. <p>But a tradition that stretches back through generations is under serious threat. There are too many farmers in Turkey, and the state can no longer afford to support them.</p> <p>\"People are selling their land, selling their tractors,\" said Muzaffer Turkoglu, the provincial representative of the Turkish Chamber of Agriculture in Polatli.</p> <p>\"They are struggling to survive.\"</p> <p>It is not hard to work out why. In the leading industrialised countries an average of 5% of the population work in the agricultural sector, and they are subsidised by the rest. In Turkey agriculture accounts for more than 40% of the work force, and the subsidies are crippling the economy.</p> <p>So, under a strict economic reform programme agreed with the International Monetary Fund, the government has set the price of wheat much lower this year than the farming lobby demanded. Now the farmers are feeling the pinch.</p> <p>Millions of people have migrated from the countryside in the last 20 years to take up residence in suburbs and shanty towns on the edge of the big cities. All the signs are that the pace of migration will increase, as new farming techniques and changing economic priorities drive many small agricultural communities out of business.</p> <p>\"It's inevitable that over time more people will move from the rural areas to the cities,\" said Haluk Kasnakoglu, an economist at the Middle East Technical University in Ankara.</p> <p>\"My concern is that current policies are making it happen too quickly. It could be a recipe for social unrest.\"</p> <p>There are various pilot projects for schemes to help support farmers without keeping agricultural prices artificially high. But the state's aim is to reduce the number of people working in agriculture, and there is no painless way of doing it.</p> <p>Agricultural reform is part of the country's preparations for possible membership of the European Union.</p> <p>When attention focuses on Turkey's relations with the EU, issues such as human rights and democratic reform usually grab the headlines, but what happens down on the farm is equally significant in the long term.</p> <p>\"The common agricultural policy gets enough flak as it is,\" a European diplomat in Ankara said. \"Just imagine what 25m Anatolian peasants could do to it.\"</p> <p>The government agrees. Without reform, it insists, Turkish agriculture will remain ill-equipped to survive in a global economy. But small farmers in the Anatolian heartland are already feeling the chill winds of competition.</p> <p>\"We used to be self-sufficient,\" Sait Akyar said as he waited to sell his tractor-load of wheat.</p> <p>\"But they've annihilated our economy by importing cheap surplus crops from other countries\".</p> <p>It is not all bad news. Turkey has all the natural advantages it needs - good soil, a good climate and plenty of water. It could still become the breadbasket of Europe.</p> <p>Economists insist that agriculture is the most backward sector of the Turkish economy, and that reform must come. But many farmers in Anatolia are facing tough times ahead, as their traditional rural lifestyle changes for ever.</p>",
  "The foreign secretary, Robin Cook, yesterday urged the United States to join moves to set up an international criminal court that will attempt to bring to trial those responsible for genocide. <p>Mr Cook dismissed US objections to the court, which has already won the backing of almost 100 countries. </p> <p>The government yesterday published a draft bill to ratify the ICC. The law has to be changed to pave the way for the setting up of the court, including empowering Britain to take action against dictators that abuse their powers. </p> <p>The US Congress fears that US servicemen could be tried for any abuses committed overseas. </p> <p>But Mr Cook described this as a mistake. \"The international criminal court will act only where national courts have failed to offer a remedy. Therefore, I think the concern about US servicemen is misplaced. </p> <p>\"There is a strong judicial system in the US, it can take action itself if there were to be breaches of international humanitarian law by US servicemen... in those circumstances the ICC does not apply. </p> <p>\"We in Britain would not be exposing our servicemen to vexatious prosecution. We have signed up to the ICC because we are confident there is no risk of that.\" </p> <p>Mr Cook said the court will send a \"very clear signal to dictators around the world that they cannot get away with mass murder, genocide, or crimes against humanity, such as employing child soldiers\". </p> <p>Even without the US, there is a powerful coalition. Ninety-eight countries have backed the court. </p> <p>The ICC will have an independent prosecutor who can decide what cases to initiate without seeking permission from the UN security council, where decisions are often deadlocked. </p> <p>Mr Cook said: \"It will be a court which will have powers, not just of severe punishment of up to 30 years in prison, but it will also be able to order them to pay reparation to the victims, because people who are brutal dictators often become wealthy dictators, and this court can deal not just with their crimes, but with that wealth.\" </p> <p>In reality, the court is more likely to be effective against small-scale dictators, such as Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian president, provided he could be arrested. </p> <p>The shadow foreign secretary, Francis Maude, while welcoming the court in principle, questioned its effectiveness if the US and China declined to sign up. </p> <p>Kate Allen, Amnesty International director, said: \"The draft bill represents a major step forward in the search for global justice. The UK government should be congratulated on its commitment to such a court.\" </p> <p><b>Useful link</b></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.fco.gov.uk/news/newstext.asp?4085\" target=\"_NEW\">www.fco.gov.uk/news/newstext.asp?4085</a> Draft bill and consultation document on the international criminal court</p>",
  "Bill Clinton arrives in Nigeria today to bolster a president whose battles with legislators and growing public disdain make his own political tribulations pale by comparison. <p>His visit coincides with growing American alarm at the state of Nigeria's fledgling democracy. Olusegun Obasanjo has only been in power for 15 months and he is already faced with no confidence motions in the corruption-plagued parliament, a disillusioned public who believes that political feuding is denying them better living conditions, and increasing religious and ethnic separatism. </p> <p>\"If democracy takes root in Nigeria, it will lift up an entire region,\" Mr Clinton said this week. \"So we'll do our part to help with trade and investment in [Nigeria's] efforts to ensure that the vast wealth it has accumulated and squandered in the past finally benefits its people.\" </p> <p>The last US president to visit Nigeria was Jimmy Carter. Mr Obasanjo was running the country on that occasion too, but as a military ruler. Mr Clinton bypassed Nigeria in his tour of Africa two years ago because the brutal General Sani Abacha was ensconced as dictator. </p> <p>Now Nigeria is one of the four countries - along with Ukraine, Colombia and Indonesia -identified by the Americans as the key to building democratic and stable government in their respective regions. </p> <p>Two years ago it was getting no financial aid from the US. Now it is the biggest beneficiary in sub-Saharan Africa. But its problems are manifold. Mr Clinton was to have visited Kano, the commercial capital of the north, and Port Harcourt, the south-eastern centre of the Nigeria's blighted oil industry. Both visits were called off for \"security\" reasons. </p> <p>Despite the big security contingent accompanying him, the state of Kano was considered too dangerous, because of the surge in Islamic fundamentalism in northern Nigeria. </p> <p>Strict sharia law has been introduced in eight states this year, most recently in Kano, and there was concern how an admitted adulterer would be received by hardline religious leaders and a public prone to murderous anti-Christian riots. </p> <p>Mr Clinton would have been far more welcome in the Niger delta, but while that would have posed few threats to his physical wellbeing, it carried political dangers. He could hardly have gone to Port Harcourt without meeting the leaders of the communities which consider themselves blighted by pollution and repressed as a result of the exploitation of the region's oil resources by big companies, including US companies such as Chevron. </p> <p>Had he met them, Mr Clinton would have been put in the delicate position of either having to sympathise with the victims or defend the oil companies. </p> <p><b> Turmoil</b><br> </p> <p> So Mr Clinton will remain in Abuja, the least Nigerian of Nigeria's cities. The capital, carved out of the bush 20 years ago, rarely suffers the power cuts, fuel shortages and subsiding roads that plague Lagos and other big cities. </p> <p>Nevertheless he will have few problems experiencing the turmoil of Nigerian politics. He is to address a joint sitting of the national assembly, which is perpetually feuding with Mr Obasanjo at the expense of a great deal of much-needed legislation, including bills to combat corruption and develop the oil region. </p> <p>The president accuses parliamentarians of incompetence and corruption, not without justification after they secretly voted themselves each a \u00a332,000 furniture allowance. </p> <p>For the third time in little more than a year, members of the upper house have had to find a new leader after the most recent senate president, Chuba Okadigbo, was exposed as having illegally awarding himself \u00a3390,000 in allowances and a Christmas bonus. </p> <p>Mr Okadigbo even spirited the mace from the senate chambers in an effort to prevent its members from impeaching him. </p> <p>Earlier this week the US embassy was still trying to find out who the senate's leaders are so that they can be invited to meet Mr Clinton. </p> <p>The parliamentarians hit back by accusing Mr Obasanjo of overstepping his powers and showing dictatorial tendencies. His growing band of critics say he provides little leadership and spends too much time touring the globe to promote Nigeria, instead of staying at home to force through legislation and privatisation programmes. </p> <p>The political standoff led to a six-month delay in passing this year's budget. When Mr Obasanjo accused MPs of wanting to be paid off, the chairman of the lower house's anti-corruption committee, Adams Jagaba, responded this week with a motion of no confidence in the president and an implicit threat of impeachment. </p> <p>\"He should know that he is creating more problems than solutions, and that is a dangerous signal,\" he said. \"This is because the national assembly might be forced to exercise its constitutional powers on him. I am sure Clinton would have a word or two to say on the relationship between the arms of government.\" </p> <p>With Mr Clinton's visit looming, the house backed away from the confrontation and shelved the motion. But once he has gone it will be back on the agenda. </p> <p>\"I think you could fairly say that whatever problems Clinton has with a hostile Congress it is nothing compared to what Obasanjo has to deal with,\" a US diplomat said. </p> <p>\"The man's been in office for a year or so and they're already trying to get him out because he won't let them rob the treasury at will. </p> <p>\"But Obasanjo is also a big part of the problem. He provides no leadership. He spends a lot of time out of the country, and it is true that he has this authoritarian style of leadership which might have been all right when he was last in power but is too inflexible for what needs to be done in Nigeria today.\" </p> <p>Mr Obasanjo has undoubtedly curbed the single most immediate threat to Nigeria's fledgling democracy, the military, by purging the upper echelons of the army of the most corrupt and least loyal officers. </p> <p>But there are those who are afraid that his efforts may all prove academic. The question debated interminably in Nigeria's vibrant press is whether Mr Obasanjo is presiding over the breakup of a country which has held together for 40 years of independence despite the odds and a bloody civil war. For months Mr Obasanjo brushed aside the crisis provoked by sharia rule in the north and its impact on the ever louder separatist rumblings of the south. </p> <p><b> Intolerance</b><br> </p> <p> He argued that they were a distraction from his serious efforts to steer the lumbering Nigerian ship of state away from the rocks. But eventually he was forced to concede that religious and regional fanaticism threatened to overwhelm his reforms. This week he pleaded for tolerance. </p> <p>\"We need the right environment devoid of rancour and acrimony; an atmosphere of tolerance, of give and take, and of brotherliness and good neighbourliness is desired for progress. We will achieve nothing if everyone takes up arms against the other. A nation cannot subsist under an atmosphere of intolerance,\" he said. </p> <p>Bill Clinton will be steered well clear of the politics, but he will get a glimpse of the consequences. His only journey outside Nigeria's sterile capital will be to the tiny village of Pykasa, seven miles from Abuja. It too has been spruced up: villagers have been hurriedly filling in the pot holes. </p> <p>But the local chief, Amos Tuzambo, has higher aims. He hopes Mr Clinton will deliver what his own president cannot. </p> <p>\"I have been informed the American president will visit my domain. He will see our needs. We need water, electricity, a school, and a hospital would be nice,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Theatre <strong> <br> 1500 Metres Above the Level of Jack ****</strong> Edinburgh Festival Theatre </strong><br> Imagine Beckett had been Argentinian, had seen a few Jeunet and Caro films and liked Delicatessen best, and had a thing about diving. Set all this in a bathroom and you have something very wonderful: Federico Leon's 1500 Metres Above the Level of Jack (Mil quinientos metros sobre el nivel de Jack), a show that puts the quirk back into quirky and then some. </p> <p>The international festival director, Brian McMaster, stumbled upon a rehearsal for this production in Buenos Aires last year and snapped it up for Edinburgh on the spot. \"We have nothing like it in the programme,\" is his reasoned explanation (and given the uneven theatre offerings this year, that's a compliment). Jack is dreamy, seductive, irresistible, like underwater swimming in proper, clear sea. </p> <p>Jack, a husband, father and compulsive diver, has gone missing, maybe with another woman. His wife sits in a bath, the tap dripping all the while (\"great unease for those of us with weak bladders\" said a gent in the front row), her son dips in and out. He is wearing a wetsuit, she a cozzie. They watch telly, though the picture is not great. \"It's got water in it,\" she says. </p> <p>They splish and splosh and then are joined by the son's girlfriend, Lisa (she's really called Marina), and her oddball son, Enzo. He throws water biscuits at people. They both have swimming gear on under their clothes. The man in their life has also disappeared, maybe drowned himself. They all end up in the bath. </p> <p>Somehow, out of this strangeness, Leon weaves a poetic, often demonically funny tale about what it means to be a father, what it means to be abandoned. The ways in which we shield ourselves from the harshness of reality are in the mix too - they each slink under the water, envelop themselves in wetsuits. It is beautifully acted by the small cast. Hold your breath, prepare yourself for strangeness as startling as a pool of icy water: jump in. (EB) \u0095 Till tomorrow. Box office: 0131-473 2000. </p> <p><strong> Comedy <strong> <br> The Johnny Vegas Gameshow ****</strong> Edinburgh Garden Party </strong><br> When Johnny Vegas exhorts you to \"'ave some fun, son,\" what he really means is \"be afraid - be very afraid\". This year, the hectoring, belligerent comic has left behind his potter's wheel and gone for a briskly tacky gameshow format. Woe betide anyone frogmarched into being a contestant: the alternative title could be Who Wants To Be A Nervous Wreck? </p> <p>I would not for all the tea in China (or as it happened, all the Heineken in a supermarket trolley) have been in the shoes of hapless Charlie, who turned out to be the comedy reviewer from the Observer. He got off lightly. Worse yet to be on the receiving end of Johnny's affection, like the male contestant who was wrestled to the floor in an extended display of slobbering lachrymose tenderness. </p> <p>Vegas, a rotund, boozy Pa Ubu in a crimplene safari suit, knows that terror is the unspoken key ingredient in showbiz, and makes it clear from the start, quickly identifying punters as stalkers or lesbian piano teachers. He divides the audience into two and sets the teams against each other, because \"hatred breeds entertainment\". Not so much Chris Tarrant, then, as Chris Tyrant. The terror only increases when Vegas exposes his blubbering, embittered vulnerability - playing secret tapes of so-called friends carping about him, or moaning about his failure to get a part in the forthcoming Lord of The Rings movie. </p> <p>The momentum is touch-and-go, full blast at the start, then sagging badly. By the end, people have even started warming to Vegas, which is a worrying sign. But when he is on form, he has Theatre of Cruelty down to a tee. (JR) <strong> Classical <strong><br> Late Night Bach *****</strong> Usher Hall, Edinburgh </strong><br> Andras Schiff's late-night concerts of Bach's keyboard music have become a feature of recent festivals. This year he turns his attention to the six English suites Bach compiled around 1725, though they were probably written more than a decade before. Schiff has become something of a talisman for the whole music programme at the international festival: he has been at the centre of four concerts of Schumann's chamber music over the past week. </p> <p>One of the products of such a close relationship between festival and artist is that the audience has the concentration of a gathering of Schiff's closest confidants. You sense that his playing is as free from mannerism and as intimate as it would be in his own front room; and the atmosphere bristles with a keen, cerebral focus on the stark mastery of Bach's compositions and Schiff's performances. </p> <p>Yet there is nothing austere about Schiff's attitude to Bach. In fact in movements like the headlong rush of the Bour\u00e9es and Gigue from the first suite, he has an impish impetuosity, and for all the seriousness of the E minor fifth suite, it is his playful exaggeration of the final Gigue's vivid chromaticism which is most memorable. </p> <p>From the rustic drone of the Musette in the third suite to the rigorous counterpoint of the fifth suite's Prelude, Schiff conjures Bach's expressive world to life. For an hour in the Usher Hall, Bach's music is a complete, all-encompassing musical universe. (TS)</p> <p>\u0095 Final concert tonight at 10.30pm. </p> <p> <strong> Cabaret <strong> <br>Arthur Smith sings Leonard Cohen ***</strong> Edinburgh Pleasance </strong><br> Arthur Smith has long been a dangerously over-exposed figure - Loose Ends, BA's soporific in-flight comedy programme, and even a Guardian Edinburgh diary - so it comes as a surprise to be reminded that he is such a commanding performer. With his doleful, grey, rasping voice, emerging as if from the bottom of a deep well, he is a perfect candidate to perform the Leonard Cohen songbook. </p> <p>He sings out of love for the man's work, and because the show's title suggested the most lugubrious afternoon you could imagine on the fringe. </p> <p>It is partly a tribute to Cohen - \"the greatest comedian of the 20th century\" - partly a rambling philosophical discourse on boredom, addiction, depression and ducks. Smith maintains a rather lofty distance from the audience, telling his tales in a stentorian boom. He is very much a monologist rather than a stand-up, and the riffing factor in his routine is nil. But his intricately structured ramble, which, I suspect, would be even better on radio, affectingly mixes farce with a streak of melancholy. </p> <p>It is only a shame that his rather heartfelt renditions of Famous Blue Raincoat and other bedsit favourites are self-consciously sabotaged by his clowning around with the guitarist. Ronnie Golden may do a virtuoso Jimi Hendrix impression, but the device of the comedy accompanist is one of the wearier institutions of the circuit. </p> <p>Still, believe it or not, Smith can sing - that is, inasmuch as Leonard Cohen himself can. To paraphrase the great man, he was born this way, he had no choice, he was born with the gift of a golden voice. A Jacques Brel for the 21st century, surely, or Rod McKuen on acid? (JR)</p> <p><strong> Film <strong><br> George Washington ****</strong> Cameo cinema </strong><br> The title is deceptive. David Gordon Green's feature film debut is not a biography of the pre-eminent revolutionary of the US, but a sardonic, beautifully filmed fable of America's predilection for indulging in heroic ideals. </p> <p>There is something of the resonance that Wes Anderson's Rushmore, summoning up the giant presidential rock carvings, got out of its title; and in its flashes of humour and its idiosyncratic protagonist, George Washington actually echoes much of Rushmore's distinctive mood. But the milieu is considerably different - a small, rusting southern town, its multi-racial population living in fragile harmony - and at George Washington's forefront are a bunch of young teens whiling away their summer at the swimming hole or running along the railway tracks. </p> <p>There is a character called George, but he is no Washington: he is a 13-year-old African- American kid (Donald Holden) who has to wear a crash helmet because of a skull-plates problem. He is sweet natured, but hardly the brightest penny on the collection plate. The film's narrator is 12-year-old Nasia (Candace Evanofski), whose rambling, meditative voiceovers convey a beyond-her-years sophistication. </p> <p>Scene casually follows scene: kids fight, local track workers eat their lunch, girls discuss their boyfriends. What initially appears a beguiling, but directionless, narrative is suddenly focused when, out of the blue, one of the teens is accidentally killed, and events take a macabre, stricken turn and the movie just gets weirder, and funnier. </p> <p>Writer-director Green deserves considerable credit for creating an authentically impressive film at his first attempt. The effortless naturalism of his performers only reinforces the film's matter-of-fact stylishness. (AP) </p> <p>\u0095 Today at Cameo 1. Box 0ffice: 0131-623 8030. </p>"
