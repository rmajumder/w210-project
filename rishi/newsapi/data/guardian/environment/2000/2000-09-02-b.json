  "<p>'When I arrived in Johannesburg, I jumped into a hire car and drove up to a game reserve. As I hadn't had time to send the document back to London until I got to the reserve, I parked next to an elephant quietly eating a small tree, and emailed London.' </p> <p>No jokes about trunk calls please, this is Christopher Davis's career he's talking about. And while this sort of surfing safari is not an everyday activity, it's not atypical either. Davis is a virtual solicitor, one of a growing band of teleworkers working from home or other locations far away from their office base. He maintains contact with clients and colleagues worldwide though email, mobile phone and the internet. </p> <p>This year the number of teleworkers like Davis will hit 10 million in Europe and by 2005 the figure will comfortably exceed 16 million - more than 10 per cent of the European workforce. Finland leads the way but, with a quarter of a million new teleworkers since last spring, Britain is catching up fast. These statistics form part of a European-wide survey into teleworking to be published in London later this month at Telework 2000. </p> <p>This is the first time the European teleworking conference has been held in the UK. Peter Johnston, head of the European Commission's information society directorate, who ordered the research, will be among the speakers. He says the EC sees the promotion of teleworking as central to achieving its aim of raising the proportion of Europeans of working age in employment from 61 per cent today to 70 per cent by 2010. 'We have to hit this target if we are to fund social security and pensions in the future and teleworking removes a lot of the barriers to working - particularly for women, older people and disabled people,' he says. </p> <p>The EU is funding research into electronic methods of working to the tune of 50 million euros (\u00a331 million). 'The European Social and Regional Development funds which exist to accelerate development in less-favoured regions of the EU have also been very effective in getting teleworking schemes onstream,' says Johnston. 'Teleworking is not just about greater efficiency and productivity, it is increasingly the most effective way to improve the work-life balance, the way to stimulate creativity and the way to achieve more efficient use of office space and transport infrastructures.' </p> <p>Alan Denbigh, executive director of the TCA (the Telework and Telecentre Association) says: 'The conventional 9-5 workplace is actually unsuitable for work. The buildings are often unhealthy and there are constant interruptions.' He also believes that the traditional office environment with its fixed hours, clothing and hierarchies, all reminiscent of schooldays, is 'infantilising'. He says 'teleworkers are re-empowered and this increases productivity'. </p> <p>'Any major organisation that has still not considered flexible working is going to miss out,' says Ursula Laws of the Institute of Employment Studies. Her organisation's figures show how far teleworking has spread. She says: 'There has been an increase of 22 per cent in employees teleworking and 15 per cent in self-employed, a 12 per cent increase in clerical working despite a general decrease in the clerical workforce and a growth in financial services, the strongest of all sectors, by 34 per cent.' </p> <p>One type of business that could be revolutionised by teleworking is the call-centre, where demand for staff frequently exceeds supply. Only 4 per cent of call centre managers employ teleworkers, but 42 per cent expect to do so in the near future. Next time you break down your emergency call could well be taken by one of the 150 people working in the AA's virtual call centre. Denbigh says: 'It takes 18 months to build a call centre and a couple of weeks to set up a virtual one. Which would you choose? Teleworking reduces the overheads - there may be marginally increased technology costs but these are more than offset by savings in office space - and it increases flexibility as nobody wants to come into the office for just a couple of hours' work, but at home it's different.' </p> <p>He says manufacturers of the technology such as BT and IBM are proving through their own working practices that the technology is up to the job. One former BT employer says: 'For years BT was advocating teleworking but not doing it itself. It has realised this and now lots of BT staff work from home.' </p> <p>The teleworker's teleworker must be Volker Krieger. He lives in Germany and works for a Swiss technology corporate with customers all over Europe and Poland. 'I have at least three offices,' he says. 'Half of the time, it's my lap top which I frequently use in the car hooked up to a mobile phone, 20 per cent of the time I'm at home and 30 per cent of the time I work in one or other of our offices. About half of my work is virtual and half is physical - that is, face-to-face with the client, but that's expensive and time-consuming. I think I can reduce this to less than 20 per cent.' </p> <p>Krieger believes teleworking will become the natural way of operating. 'It's a generational thing. Today's schoolchildren will be natural teleworkers. To them using the tools of teleworking is normal not new.' </p> <p>Currently, transnational teleworking is limited but the European company statute will, when agreed by the EU countries, enable direct employer-employee relationships to be established across the national boundaries. Nevertheless, Denbigh suggests that there may be a geographical limit, at least as far as employees are concerned. 'The AA want all staff to live within 70 miles of the administration centre because of the need for meetings and supervisions.' </p> <p>However, for freelancers even the sky is not the limit. Teleworkers in the UK and Ireland working with US companies simply adjust their own hours to the working day across the Atlantic. </p> <p>Anna Brady works for a company with offices in California and New York from her flat in Dublin. 'Only one or two people in the entire company work on-site,' she says. 'The company runs newsgroups which give you an idea of the history of different projects, and of the personalities of other members of the virtual team. When I visited the US for the first time it was a surprise to see how some of these people looked in real life.' </p> <p>Never having to look at the bloke at the next desk. Now that's a reason to telework. </p> <p><strong>Pros </strong></p> <p> 1 Save time and money on travelling </p> <p> 2 More control over your work and other parts of your life </p> <p> 3 No interruptions, gossip or office politics </p> <p> 4 Improved quality of life </p> <p> 5 Greater opportunity for community involvement </p> <p> 6 Good for environment </p> <p><strong> Cons </strong></p> <p> 1 Need high degree of personal motivation </p> <p> 2 Need space to work in </p> <p> 3 More dependent on technology </p> <p> 4 Potential lack of human contact </p> <p> 5 Could be frozen out in office politics </p> <p> 6 Can never escape from the office </p> <p> 7 Less distinction between work and home </p> <p>\u0095 A new edition of 'The Teleworking Handbook' published by the Telework and Telecentre Association is available now for \u00a319.95.

  "<p>1 Don't expect it to be a healthy work environment. When the sexes are segregated, they can become caricatures. In the absence of men, some women will become obsessed with talking about sex. In places where women dislike being in a female ghetto, there can be bullying and cruelty - convents, for instance, especially where the novices were forced to enrol at a young age. </p> <p>2 Understand the reasons why women choose certain work - nannying, for instance, teaching, nursing, librarianship, PR and part-time jobs. Some may be attracted to the 'caring' professions; many will enjoy the field of communications; and large numbers will appreciate the family-friendly policies that flourish in many of these industries. But there can be a price to pay if naturally ambitious women are forsaking a more fulfilling career. </p> <p>3 Recognise the benefits. Women colleagues are more likely to admit they are wrong, to apologise and to be content to be out of the limelight. Novelist Wendy Holden, author of Bad Heir Day , used to work on women's magazines: 'One of the strengths of women is their attitude to detail. They could pick up a phrase someone used in an interview and build another feature on that.' Men are more likely, Holden feels, to want the glamour of suggesting a big original idea. </p> <p>4 Be wary of the stereotypes of 'women bosses' and the alleged bitchiness of female workplaces. If this happens, it probably relates to other causes such as the fact that fewer women reach the boardroom and there's a greater insecurity perhaps among those who want to get there. The gossip that surrounds them will almost always accentuate the fact that they are female - suggesting that they are sleeping their way to the top, for instance. </p> <p>5 Take advantage of the far franker emotional environment. Few women will think the worse of Sandra for crying at her desk after getting bad news - an action which would horrify colleagues in a male office. As John Gray outlines in Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus , most women relish the giving and taking of sympathy and advice. In concentrated form, however, it can become too much. Maureen was eventually ground down by the caring environment of her all-female team: 'If someone had a headache, at least three people would remember and ask about it the next day.'</p>",
  "<p> \"A new era of great British production... great British production in all genres... great British programmes.\" Britishness runs like a litany through Greg Dyke's MacTaggart Lecture, reiterating the hope that the BBC's distinct national identity may continue to single it out from the dozens of other channel offerings in the digital revolution. </p> <p>Presumably Dyke means multi-ethnic Britishness, not Englishness, although the BBC's royal charter horoscope (January 1 1927) links strongly to the quintessential English national horoscope, the coronation of William the Conqueror on Christmas Day 1066. Both horoscopes have an identical Capricorn sun, making the BBC the cultural crown of the nation. Capricorn's are traditional, reserved, dutiful... the stuffy Beeb and the stiff upper lip.</p> <p>Dyke aims to make this old Capricorn Auntie \"more exciting, more gripping\", but she faces the unanswerable dilemma of justifying a licence fee in an age of commercial channels. He wants universality - free, public service broadcasting - with channel genres and a creative environment for talented people. Will his strategies work?</p> <p>Dyke's realistic, business-oriented Taurean nature (May 20 1947) peppers his lecture with talk of cash for this and cash for that. With the Gemini twins also strong, he should move deftly between public service broadcasting and commercial profit, from analogue past to digital future. </p> <p>The immediate prospects look good. The BBC has tremendous leverage with its vast programme content through pay-on-demand and IT related services. Radical changes can be expected in June 2002 when the Sun joins hi-tech Uranus, favouring creative outsider talent.</p> <p>But there's something missing. Media today has the Jupiterian role once performed by the church or the law, providing ethical and spiritual authority, but this isn't the language of modern times. Dyke's Taurean approach suggests management, not vision. To hold its archetypal place in the nation's psyche, the BBC must take this on board, with Dyke or without him. </p> <p>Email the Media Medium at: <a href=\"mailto:maggie@companyguide.co.uk\">maggie@companyguide.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>A price war has broken out down under with the introduction of Richard Branson's new Australian domestic airline, Virgin Blue, which began flying on the popular 65-minute route between Sydney-Brisbane on Thursday for A$99 (\u00a340). </p> <p>Qantas, Ansett and another new private airline, Impulse, have been forced to follow suit, slashing their fares and bringing obvious commercial benefits to Sydney and Brisbane but more significantly to the cities' beautiful and less explored rural hinterlands. </p> <p>More and more overseas tourists are visiting rural Australia; a recent report showed they spend nearly \u00a31bn each year outside the cities. Towns such as Toowoomba in Queensland's fertile Darling Downs, and Broken Hill in outback New South Wales are key staging posts for overlanders and tour groups searching for the Real Australia - a land of wide-open spaces, pioneers, and rural hospitality. </p> <p>There's a world of difference between the \"country\" and the \"outback\", as far as Australians are concerned. The former is the good farmland and rolling, verdant hills that stretch away from the coasts but stop short of the desert fringe. Outback is everything else - Australia's burning heart where eucalyp tus groves turn into wide expanses of salt bush, creeks lose their water and bronzed mountain ranges lie like the carcasses of long-dead dinosaurs across the desert floor. </p> <p> By the time the Great Dividing Range reaches Queensland, its mountains have become hills and its crags softened into grassy knolls. </p> <p>The Darling Downs is one of the most poetic landscapes in Australia, and was as far into the interior as most settlers risked going in the 1800s. Beyond here lie hostile outback plains of red dust. </p> <p>Well-to-do Englishmen claimed vast tracts of this land, building homesteads and living like lords , dressing for dinner and riding to hounds . One of them, a timber merchant, settled on Listening Ridge, 15 minutes from Toowoomba, the commercial centre of the Downs, and built a house with views to a distant horizon. </p> <p>Today, his descendants, Sue and Shirley Pechey, run it as a B&amp;B. Guests stay in two cosy cabins, eat home-cooked meals and have several hundred square miles of stunning hill country to explore. Nearby is Crow's Nest National Park, one of the last spreads of original eucalyptus forest left in the Downs, and home to an assortment of Australia's comic wildlife, such as sugar gliders, blue-faced honeyeaters and platypus. </p> <p> <strong> Getting there: </strong> Two to three hours' drive from Brisbane by road.

Miners poured in from all over Australia and abroad. The town built 77 hotels to hold them. Now, it is foreign visitors who flock to here for a taste of pioneer heritage. </p> <p>Broken Hill is the centre of the Accessible Outback, where visitors can experience life in the desert without giving up the comforts of home. There are mine tours; a host of art galleries and a peaceful sculpture garden in which to enjoy the sunset; Mutawintji National Park with ancient Aboriginal rock-carvings; and tranquil lakes at Menindee, with its flocks of exotic birds. </p> <p>A day's drive north is the opal mining town of White Cliffs. A kangaroo shooter first stumbled over a dazzling opal here more than 100 years ago and men have come ever since to dig and live in holes in the ground. </p> <p>One set of old workings has become the Dug Out Underground Motel, sculpted by Leon and Marge Hornby. </p> <p> <strong> Getting there: </strong> From Sydney, <a href=\"http://www.gsr.com.au\">Indian Pacific and the Ghan trains</a> take approximately 18 hours and cost \u00a3100 return.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.greyhound.com.au\">Greyhound coaches</a> also take about 18 hours and cost \u00a325 one-way.</p> <p>Flights with <a href=\"http://www.hazelton.com.au\">Hazelton Ansett</a>, 00 61 2 6393 11000, cost \u00a3194 for 21-day advance return from Sydney. 4WD needed for White Cliffs and Mutawintji. </p> <p> <strong> What to do: </strong> Mine tours Broken Hill Tourism (00 61 8 8087 6077, email <a href=\"mailto:tourist@pcpro.net.au\">tourist@pcpro.net.au</a>); Thankakali cultural centre to meet Aboriginal artists (00 61 8 8087 6111); Mutawintji National Park for rock paintings (00 61 8 8088 5933); opal mines in White Cliffs (Broken Hill Tourism for list); Sculpture Symposium for sunset (Broken Hill Tourism for gate key); Lakes nature tour (Geoff Looney 00 61 8 8091 4437). </p> <p> <strong> General information: </strong> <a href=\"http://www.tourism.nsw.gov.au\">Tourism New South Wales</a> (UK), tel: 020-7887 5003. </p> <p> <strong> Where to stay: </strong> Miner's Cottages (Broken Hill Tourism for list).

Convicts from Britain and Ireland deemed too dangerous to keep in the burgeoning colony of Sydney Cove were shipped north to an unknown place with an infernal climate. Being a few miles inland on the Brisbane River, it missed the coastal breezes. </p> <p>Prisoners suffered inhuman accommodation and back-breaking labour in the steamy tropical heat. Neither they nor their gaolers could have dreamed that nearly 200 years later, thousands of people would crave this spot, its mangrove swamps and year-round sunshine. </p> <p>For Brisbane is booming. Property prices are rocketing, businesses are flocking here to set up offices and hold conferences, and service industries can barely keep pace with the influx of holidaymakers. </p> <p>The South Bank cultural complex on the Brisbane River has the fun and style of its London ancestor. Its exhibitions of international and contemporary Australian art and design are making the Sydney galleries keep a close eye on their northern rival. </p> <p>The Botanical Gardens inhabit a loop of the river and make for a good early morning stroll. The French Renaissance architecture of Parliament House is a throwback to colonial times, as are many of the buildings in the city. A heritage trail takes in several of them and is a good starting point for visitors fresh off the plane. </p> <p> The proximity of the city to the Great Barrier Reef, an hour's flight north, has added to its popularity. And the giant casino at the glitzy, gaudy holiday playground of the Gold Coast, two hours south by road, which has given the region the unwelcome nickname of BrisVegas, has boosted the number of visitors. </p> <p>Possibly its greatest asset, however, is the lack of attitude. While Sydney glows with celebrity status and chutzpah, and Melbourne with aloof European style and chic, Brisbane is relaxed and unassuming. Palm trees shading riverside caf\u00e9s rustle in the warm breezes. Elegant, colonial, Queenslander homes sport wide verandas made for lounging and watching the world go by. </p> <p><strong> Where to stay: </strong> The sandstone walls of the Conrad International (00 61 7 3306 8888, email: <a href=\"mailto:hotelres@conrad.com.au&quot;\">hotelres@conrad.com.au</a>) originally housed the state government cabinet.

  "<p>There are dozens of big-time sporting competitions in the world. Baseball, tennis, football of many codes, basketball, motor racing, golf, athletics, swimming, horse racing. They are all competing for the sports fan's time and money. </p> <p>Cricket is one sport that has not kept up with the modern sports fan. Continuing to be propped up by one-day cricket, first-class and Test cricket has made no attempt to catch the eye or make itself accessible for the casual fan. The advances in presentation, promotion and formatting of the one-day game have not crossed over to the longer format as it should have. In the way are the 'purists' who want to keep the game as it was when they were young, around the Second World War.</p> <p>It's about time the game caught up with the rest of the world, to catch the eye of the fans, entice them to come and give them a reason to come back. Changes must be made to presentation, spectator convenience and context.</p> <p>Presentation is easy to solve. Use a white ball for first-class cricket. Make a white ball visible over 80 overs. For the first 40 overs, use a standard white ball. For the next 40 use a standardised \"old\" ball, which has rougher leather and flatter stitching, but is otherwise a bright, lacquered brand new ball. Easy to see, and plays like the real thing. Now you can play at night, wear coloured uniforms, show the crowd who they paid money to see. Grab the attention of the casual observer who has come to see Tendulkar or Warne or the new kid they've been hearing about. A big portion of gate earnings would surely come from the part-time fan - it's most important they feel at home too.</p> <p>Next, shorten the matches. Five days, over one working week, the weekend and the next week is asking too much of the public when it can follow other games much more easily. Taking a young family to sit for seven or more hours is asking too much. First-class and Test cricket could easily take the following form:</p> <p>- Three-day matches of four playing hours each, or 180 overs.</p> <p>- Eleven-a-side still, but to win a match, a side has to score more runs, and, over two innings, dismiss 13 (as against 20) batters. (Everybody has a bat before anybody bats for a second time.) Draws are still possible.</p> <p>- First innings closes after 60 overs or a declaration, whichever is first.</p> <p>Making the game shorter and easier to schedule and promote makes it more attractive to everyone involved.</p> <p>Matthew Engel's proposed Test World Championship is a great idea. Every four years, a Pura Cup-style final should be played to decide the winner. A Championship should conclude the year after the one-day World Cup. Also, play the first match of a Test series abroad or inland - Malaysia, Singapore, Holland, USA. Test matches rather than one-day tournaments. India or Pakistan v West Indies might do well in Florida.</p> <p>The current match-fixing scandals are part of a larger problem of cricket refusing to yield to the modern sporting and global landscape. It is about time it budged.</p> <p><em>Michael Gray, 23, lives in Australia</em></p>",
  "<p>How can you find out what it is really like to work for an organisation? The biggest difficulty for applicants has always been obtaining quality information. Those looking for a job would love to know if the training scheme is all it is cracked up to be, or if the promise of early responsibility is anything more than words. Unfortunately, it is just this type of information which is the most difficult to access. There are however indications that this is beginning to change. </p> <p>Traditionally, graduates have had to rely on limited resources. These include: </p> <p>The company brochure - which is as objective as any sales pitch. </p> <p>A trusted confidante - who works for the organisation and is usually a friend of the family. His or her opinion is often given considerable credence but it is easily forgotten that this is only one point of view. </p> <p>Peer endorsement - which involves the most presentable graduate trainees talking up their employer at campus events (personal endorsement being one of the oldest techniques in advertising). </p> <p>Hearsay - which becomes a resource because information is so scarce. </p> <p>The paucity of these resources is now being improved however. This year, BT is introducing a facility giving applicants access to the email addresses of graduate trainees within the company. Applicants can then ask anything about the organisation they wish, both parties being safe in the knowledge that their communication is effectively uncontrollable. </p> <p>Such thinking represents a watershed in graduate recruitment. By providing graduates with the opportunity to ask pertinent and impertinent questions outside the ambit of those who will be making the hiring decisions, the company is demonstrating two things. </p> <p>First, it is showing respect for the things the applicant might want to know but which are difficult to ask at interview. </p> <p>Secondly, it is demonstrating its trust in the professionalism of its employees. Both of these aspects emerge from the deliberate introduction of employer branding. </p> <p>According to Simon Barrow of People in Business which developed the concept, the employer brand \"is about applying to the employment experience the same care and coherence used by good marketing and sales people in the management of valued customers. It is not exclusively concerned with recruitment, but is a strategy for managing all aspects of the employee relationship.\" </p> <p>Just as sales strategies have evolved towards a greater emphasis on retention, and purchasing relationships have become more like partnerships, so the other major business activity, employment, is moving towards a more equitable footing. </p> <p>In the traditional mindset, the graduate sent the company whatever information it demanded while the company held back as much as it could. Forward-looking companies now aim to give their applicants as much information as they can. </p> <p>\"Too many companies see graduate recruiting as essentially a sales job,\" says Emma Howell, graduate manager at Tesco, a company noted for its work on employment branding. </p> <p>\"Instead it should be about providing applicants with the information they need to make an informed choice. We take applicants to a store and let them talk to the manager and a graduate trainee for an afternoon, well away from anyone involved in the decision-making process. </p> <p>\"This is about providing proper access to information, not controlled access.\" </p> <p>A few hours may not seem a lot, but as everyone in human resources knows, one cynical manager can destroy a carefully crafted corporate image in less than a minute. </p> <p>This new attitude to recruitment and retention is still not widespread. In a poll conducted by People in Business amongst delegates at the Association of Graduate Recruiters' annual conference, most employers who responded said that they had only heard of the concept of employer branding in the last year or so, while only three companies claimed that they were already recognised for their employer brand management. </p> <p>Despite this general lack of activity, the most forward-thinking companies are pushing the development because they realise that it will have an impact on their bottom line. </p> <p>\"Every company wants to employ the 2.1 who's fun,\" says Simon Barrow. \"That is, a graduate with a mix of intellectual and social skills who can thrive in the technologically sophisticated and sales-orientated environment that exists in business today. These people are scarce, and if companies cannot recruit and retain them they will fail to compete. </p> <p>\"Employer branding gives companies a coherent management strategy for keeping the talent within the organisation.\" </p> <p>In the long term, whether a company chooses to pursue employer branding will affect far more than the applicant's ability to make informed choices. </p> <p>Its use will determine whether graduates are joining a successful, forward-thinking organisation and, because employer branding is also concerned with issues such as mana-ging the work/ home balance, in the long term this could affect the quality of their lives.</p>"
