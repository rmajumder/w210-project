  "<p>It is estimated that, for the first time this year, more than $1bn will be spent on the elections in the US (state as well as presidential). Of this figure, $400m will go on advertising. Surely, at these levels of spend, there must be much to learn from America? It is well known that both Conservatives and Labour visit the US to learn what's new in electioneering. Should the advertising advisers go there too? </p> <p>The simple answer is that they needn't bother. There is now a convenient website (<a href=\"http://www.adcritic.com\">www.adcritic.com</a>) that keeps you up to date with advertising in the US, even featuring the latest TV commercials for the candidates. Which is lucky, because it wouldn't be worth the price of a ticket to see the drab succession of tit-for-tat commercials that both camps are churning out. </p> <p>This is a missed opportunity. As Roy Spence, president of ad agency GSD&amp;M of Austin, Texas points out: \"Unlike in the past, advertising could play a pivotal role in this election. In the past there were fundamental differences, and the ads played a supportive role to the messages. The issues and personalities were so stark, publicity played a supporting, not a primary, role. This time the economy is strong, there's not a world at war, Bush has moved to the middle, and there's a lot of blurring of lines in terms of the average person out there. All of that leads to advertising playing a major role.\" </p> <p>In the event, however, this has not been the outcome. Kathy Delaney, creative director of the Deutsch ad agency in New York, says: \"Both candidates do themselves a disservice by producing commercials that look and sound like bad informercials. They're invisible. It's 'Blah, blah, blah' cut against sappy music. Compelling, single-minded, believable commercials are completely missing here. The best advertising starts with a single honest truth about the brand. This stuff is served up in such a mundane, cliched way that even if there is a truth in there, it blew right by me.\" </p> <p>What the hapless US viewers are getting is what we used to get in UK party political broadcasts in the 70s - the illustrated talking head. The candidate talks to camera and when he makes a point you cut away to an illustration, as though you were a backward child who needed it all spelt out in picture-book style. </p> <p>So Bush addresses you on medical matters and when he says something about old people you get a picture of someone being pushed along in a wheelchair. In really exciting versions you get a bit of tabletop illustration, too - maybe a pile of dollar bills to make the point that it will cost money. </p> <p>There are two sorts of these commercials. First there's the one where the talking head says what his policy is before slagging off the other guy's stance on that area. The subject changes almost daily (the environment on Wednesday, Medicare on Thursday) and takes different forms for each state and for each ethnic and linguistic group (no wonder they have to be cheap and quickly made). Second, there's the \"morning in America\" life story of the candidate. It's not really advertising at all. </p> <p>The only change of pace comes from Ralph Nader (the ex-consumerist leader and now an independent presidential candidate). He makes TV ads attacking both the other candidates for spending fortunes making TV ads! </p> <p>What has happened? No especially golden period of US political advertising springs to mind, but there have been some memorable ads - LBJ's anti-Goldwater \"Daisy\" ad, with the child counting down to an atomic explosion; the unfair but memorable Republican attack on Dukakis's furlough policy that supposedly let killers out of jail to kill again. </p> <p>It seems that now the politicians have decided that they know it all and give no room to the advertising advisers (there was a telling shot in the programme about Clinton's Little Rock campaign headquarters, featuring a staff member on the telephone \"ordering up\" a tightly specified ad for the following day). That's not advertising. That's just spin, baldly stated in TV slots. There is no \"defining\" advertising theme, no strategy. Its use is solely tactical and day to day. </p> <p>The past 20 years have seen political campaigners on both sides of the Atlantic come on in leaps and bounds in their understanding of how to get through to the public. Much of this is learned from the world of advertising: the focus-group feedback, the concise message, speaking in unison, the need for repetition. Politicians have got very good at communicating - so good, it seems, that they have decided there's no room left for the input of advertising agencies. In the US, tedious ads make it obvious that the creative imagination has not been allowed to brighten things up. </p> <p>Things are rather different in the UK. Peter Mandelson learned the tricks of the trade early on and his Millbank army no longer feels the need for much more than spiky executions of its briefs. The Conservatives have always contracted it out anyway. Saatchis did it all, whether Tim Bell or, successfully in 92 and disastrously in 97, Maurice Saatchi was in charge. After the spectacular failure of their advertising strategy in 97, the Conservatives have clearly decided to internalise strategy too, with the appointment of Yellow M to do the executions. </p> <p>Both Labour and the Conservatives seem to feel that while there's not much room for ad-agency thinking, there's still a role for the memorable ad. With Trevor Beattie and Yellow M - two \"shock jocks\" if ever there were any - we should see some sparks. </p> <p>Despite the fact that the UK is unlikely to be as boring as the US, advertising could be doing more for political parties here as well as across the Atlantic. Brand advertising that creates such enormously valuable properties for companies comes from the understanding that thinking can't sensibly be separated from execution. The great campaigns come from the interaction of strategic planning and creative skills. Big brand owners, like VW or Orange, don't instruct their agencies in detailed content, but allow them latitude to spot the public's nerve end, both in the route to choose and the way that it is expressed. </p> <p>There is a role for advertising in politics beyond the recitation of policy and abuse of the other side. Parties benefit from clarity of positioning in the electorate's mind, and this needs constant adaptation as the context changes. Much of this is done, of course, by the character and message of the leader. But advertising can also delineate the territory. Mitterrand stood for president with a poster that just said \"La force tranquille\", which neatly summed up what he offered in the chaotic environment of French politics. Wilson's Labour grabbed the moment of a dying Conservative government with \"Let's Go with Labour\". </p> <p>Current political advertising is not using any of the skills that advertising agencies have in abundance: the ability to get under the skin of the public, to have insights that coincide with the way the voters, and not the politicians, see it. Advertising can do more than it is being asked to, almost as much in the UK as in the US. </p> <p>\u0095 Chris Powell is chairman of BMP DDB and led Labour's 1997 election campaign advertising</p>",

  "Measured against the prospects for global survival as the planet warms and fossil fuels are depleted, Tony Blair will find it hard tomorrow to cut a dash when he makes what is being billed as his biggest speech on the environment since assuming office. To choose this subject within days of the fuel protesters' declared \"deadline\" smacks either of foolhardiness or political nous. We hope the latter. Assessed against other countries, especially the United States, the UK deserves a small prize in the every-little-helps stakes. Building on Tory targets, Labour can claim the UK is now a world leader in cutting carbon emissions. Mixed as his fiscal motives were, Gordon Brown's foot-down approach to taxing petrol has at least mitigated the increased emissions of greenhouse gases caused by traffic growth - such emissions still rose over the 90s by about 10%. <p>But Mr Blair has too often been an all-things-to-all-people premier and may be tempted to over-promise. Where the prime minister was most convincing during the petrol crisis was his assertion that government necessarily has to hold the ring when interests diverge. And of course they do. The homeowners of Cliffe and Uckfield are not going to take kindly to being told their homes are in the wrong place or that as victims of global warming their plight has propaganda value. But the public has to realise there are connections between \"natural\" events and the pace of growth in consumption. Motorists have shown their might; but so have the oil producers. The inhabitants of north London were recently right to ask, first, whether incineration of their refuse endangered their health but, second, whether burying it is going to be any better in the long run. (And telling them to stop producing so much waste is unlikely to win votes, as the dismal fate of green parties has shown.) </p> <p>Government cannot reconcile disparate interests, but it must seek to push consistently in the right direction. The largest promise contained in Labour's manifesto was \"sustainability\" - which entails joining-up policies across the board, on energy, land use and transport. The loose baggy monster headed by John Prescott has not managed it. Agenda 21 has made some headway locally but not much. For sustainability embraces all Whitehall departments and councils as it does our domestic lives, housing and how we travel. </p> <p>A senior civil service adviser to the prime minister says government needs more \"stories\" to tell to bring people along with changes in public policy. And a more convincing story is what the prime minister needs to tell on the environment. Major policy statements are forthcoming. When, shortly, Gordon Brown makes his pre-budget statement, he must say something about fuel duty - but surely also about pollution and sustainable quality of life. John Prescott's urban and rural white papers are due and they may go some way to changing policy affecting car and land use - recent hints suggest the Treasury will now permit financial incentives to be offered developers of \"brownfield\" land. </p> <p>Mr Blair's task is to fashion a rhetoric which not only justifies specific measures (including high tax on fuel) but also tries to capture public assent for strong government. If he wants to put clear blue water between Labour and the Tories, here is a gulf. One of the paradoxes of the September protests was how they made the state seem weak; yet only collective action spearheaded by confident government can begin to move us towards sustainability.</p>",
  "Downing Street and the Treasury yesterday issued a joint rebuke to the environment minister, Michael Meacher, after he floated the idea of restoring the fuel duty escalator. <p>Government spokesmen said that ministers had no intention of bringing back the escalator which was abolished by Gordon Brown in his budget this year. </p> <p>Mr Meacher suggested that the escalator, which used to impose inflation-busting increases in fuel duties, could be restored if petrol prices fell. </p> <p>In an interview on ITV's Jonathan Dimbleby programme, Mr Meacher said that the government was determined to encourage motorists to use their cars less. Asked whether the fuel duty escalator should be restored to discourage motorists, he said: \"We may indeed have to return to the escalator if - not much hope of it at the moment - there were a sudden and dramatic fall in the oil prices.\" </p> <p>His remarks drew a withering response from Downing Street and the Treasury. A Downing Street spokesman said: \"Michael Meacher was talking about a hypothetical situation. The fact is that the government has got rid of the escalator and has no plans to bring it back again. It is as simple as that.\" </p> <p>His remarks were echoed by a Treasury spokesman. \"Mr Meacher was commenting on a hypothetical scenario and setting out the theoretical possibilities. But we abolished the fuel duty escalator at the last budget and have no intention of bringing it back.\" </p> <p>Mr Meacher's remarks incensed Downing Street and the Treasury, which are working behind the scenes to prevent a repeat of the fuel protests in September. </p> <p>The Treasury was particularly irritated because Mr Brown responded to unease among motorists in his last budget when he scrapped the fuel duty escalator which used to add 6% to fuel duties on top of the inflation rise. </p> <p>Mr Meacher's remarks yesterday were the second time within a year that he has spoken out of turn. Downing Street was forced to slap him down at last year's Labour party conference when he said that wealthy people could be barred from owning second homes in the countryside to prevent local people being priced out of the housing market. Mr Meacher faced particular embarrassment because he owns a second home in the countryside. </p> <p>The frequency with which Mr Meacher finds himself at odds with Downing Street shows the difficulties faced by the former star of the Labour left in adapting to his status as a relatively junior minister. </p> <p>Mr Meacher, 60, was elected to the shadow cabinet in 1983, the year that the prime minister and the chancellor were elected to parliament. After the 1997 election, he was one of four shadow cabinet members to be excluded from the cabinet. He was appointed environment minister. </p> <p>Many Labour MPs believe he has survived because the prime minister shows little interest in the environment. Mr Blair will attempt to show that he is committed to the environment when he addresses the Green Alliance tomorrow. </p> <p>He will put a \"third way\" gloss on his commitment when he calls on environmentalists to form a partnership with business. Mr Blair will say that the days of environmental protests are over and that green campaigners should join forces with business to tap into the demand for \"things that are green and clean\".</p>",
  "<p>Talk about a well-established family firm. Bonhams started in the business of selling in 1793, and is the only surviving Georgian auction house in London to remain under family ownership. </p> <p>Last month, a merger was announced: Bonhams is now Bonhams &amp; Brooks, the former associated with paintings, furniture, jewellery, textiles and porcelain; the latter specialists in classic cars. With a combined annual turnover of \u00a375m, this has created the fourth largest auctioneers in the world. </p> <p>Annabel Williams, 31, is based in the Knightsbridge headquarters, where she is executive secretary to both Nicholas Bonham, deputy chairman, and Nicholas Thompson, finance director and company secretary. When she started work in March, talks on the deal were already underway. </p> <p>\"I didn't so much hit the ground running, as sprinting,\" she explains. Her first few months in the job involved taking part in a confidential due diligence exercise, in which management, lawyers and accountants went through Bonhams with the proverbial fine-toothed comb. \"That was a great way of learning about the company, but a mammoth undertaking. Everything was examined. Not only the finances, but property issues, our terms of trade, insurance arrangements, and so on - the entire structure.\" </p> <p>The process took its toll on those working at Bonhams. In Williams's case, she would wake up in the early hours of the morning, and write \"must do\" notes. \"Looking back, however, it's been enjoyable. Something has been born, and I've been part of that.\" And while this corporate gestation has been taking place, routine matters have been continuing in tandem. Each lot offered for sale - there were in the region of 85,000 last year - generates a cycle of administration. \"There can be days when Nicholas Bonham doesn't put upon me, and then he'll suddenly give me a massive pile of paper to work my way through,\" she says. Thompson provides a \"pretty constant\" flow of work. </p> <p>So whose workload comes first when you have two bosses? \"If I'm told, 'Whatever you're doing, stop, because this is more important', then I'll quickly reorganise. And when there's more than enough from one, then the other will understand. They know I try to find a fair path between them.\" </p> <p>A major responsibility for Williams is preparing the monthly board meetings. \"We currently have 14 people on the board, which does mean a huge stack of papers and reports from members of staff. Organising them all can be quite a task.\" Deadlines also loom large in her day. \"I try to plan ahead, but I'm always under pressure to produce figures at speed,\" she says. </p> <p>By way of a perk (and a handy break from her desk), Williams takes the opportunity of attending sales whenever possible. \"They are the lifeblood of what we do, and watching the bidding is really exciting.\" The amounts of money involved - the fall of the gavel can be the signal for seven-figure sums to change hands - are not the primary appeal for her. Instead, it's the element of surprise when the reserve is exceeded way beyond expectations. An in-house course on taking telephone bids is available - she would love to do it, but regrets that, so far, shortage of time has got in her way. </p> <p>A career in art was always Williams's preferred choice, but the route to her ideal job was far from simple. After studying sociology, and then completing a post-graduate degree in 16th-century Italian drawing, she wrote speculative letters to \"anyone and everyone\" who might be able to offer her work experience. Her efforts came to \"absolutely nothing\". Discovering for herself what a notoriously tough environment the art world is to break into, she signed up for intensive computer training to arm herself with more skills. </p> <p>Six months after she landed a job as a telephonist at Theo Fennell, the luxury jewellers, she was PA to the joint managing director, eventually combining this with the position of facilities manager. \"That's where I learned to juggle different people and demands. If someone wanted to be in charge of a building, it was a plum job, but I didn't want to immerse myself in that. Although it was a wrench to leave, I felt I had to move on, and I've found my niche at Bonhams &amp; Brooks. </p> <p>\"It's taken me a decade since leaving university to land where I am today,\" adds Williams. \"There is a strong sense of a reputation which has been built up over many, many years here, plus you belong to an identifiable team. I like that.\" Clearly, the long wait has been worthwhile for her.</p>",
  "<p>\u0095 Well, there was us thinking that the boss's little failings - the chronic untidiness, the incompetence when trying to construct a cup of coffee, the inability to remember without constant prompting the extension number of his or her own phone - were just a trying but necessary component of the PA's role. When, in fact, all along these \"eccentricities\" have been deliberately cultivated as part of a management technique which aims to make them better leaders by appearing less perfect in the eyes of their staff. Of course. </p> <p>A piece in the most recent Harvard Business Review by Robert Goffee and Gareth Jones puts forward the theory that managers ought to decide upon a character flaw to display when in the office. This, they say, has two advantages: it makes the boss seem more human and thus more approachable (true - WPM has always found jolly nice people ever so difficult to talk to); and it also serves the purpose of masking even more unsavoury character traits (a hint: it doesn't. We know them all). WPM can only wonder how bosses decide on the one fault they are prepared to reveal. \"Shall I assemble all the paperclips in the office into a long chain? Hm, might not mask the fact that I'm a crashing bore. Set my computer to ping loudly when email arrives? No, need to be more human. Empty the photocopier of paper? A spot of vandalism in the staff toilets?\" </p> <p>\u0095 Dithering bosses would be advised not to follow the example of the City worker who admitted in a recent survey by onvocation.com that the most outrageous thing he had ever done in the office was \"playing Status Quo at full volume on my computer\". </p> <p>\u0095 There's no advice on how to deal with a pub rock-loving colleague on <a href=\"http://www.secretary1.com\">www.secretary1.com</a>, but there is plenty of stuff about improving your shorthand, finding companies to make conference badges and hiring a massage therapist to come to your office, and so it is website of the week. Although WPM, whose desk is currently carpeted in sticky memo notes of every hue, is disconcerted to learn from the site that this method of information gathering could give the impression that WPM is disorganised ... </p> <p>*WPM can often be heard moaning about it, but workplace stress can have more serious effects on staff than the now-universal hunched shoulders and hollow eyes. Stressed Out, part of Channel 4's Stop, Go Home series, goes out on Sunday and concentrates on the chaotic working environment of a council One-Stop centre in Leeds. Professional stress consultants step in to help, but don't expect feng shui and back rubs: the experts here say that they expect to find 3% of any workforce exhibiting a degree of mental disturbance that would qualify them as psychiatric outpatients. </p> <p>*From tomorrow, as Office Hours reported last month, employers have the right to monitor your emails and phone calls without your consent. Patricia Hewitt, the minister for e-commerce, has insisted that such \"routine access\" is necessary to ensure that employees are complying with company rules. Make sure you know why they can do this, and what your rights are today.<br>Check out <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/netprivacy\" target=\"_NEW\">www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/netprivacy</a>.</p> <p>\u0095 More effective rules against discrimination in the workplace should be put in place following a European Union directive passed last week that requires the government to introduce new penalties for companies that discriminate against workers because of their religion, sexual orientation, age or disability - which could go some way to resolving the problem of staff being forced to work on religious holidays. The regulations must be in place by 2003; those targeting age and disability discrimination by 2006. </p> <p>\u0095 Just when WPM thought companies were becoming more people-friendly (they don't have to wait until 2006, do they?) comes news that only 50% of workers think that their managers take the idea of employee satisfaction seriously, according to recent research into workplace attitudes by Investors in People. It seems, however, that the other 50% may have been so content in their working lives that they allowed their bosses rather too much of the credit. In the same survey, just 8% of female managers and 4% of male managers agreed that employee satisfaction was \"an important business objective\". It seems those annoying little character flaws can hide more sinister failings after all ...</p>",

The mere notion of a businessman, a barrow boy, running the Opera House! \"It would be like asking the Grim Reaper to run an old people's home,\" said one music critic. But when I question the experts closely they are more reluctant to dismiss Gubbay. His business skills speak for themselves, he loves opera, he understands the workings of the Opera House, and actually when it comes down to it there isn't an obvious candidate. </p> <p>Gubbay shuffles to the door of his north London house and welcomes me in. His trousers and shirt are on the smart side - but somehow he gives the impression of being a scruff. A schloch, as his parents might have said. </p> <p>He leaves me in the lounge. At least, I think it's the lounge. It looks like a cross between the Palace of Versailles and a car boot sale. Porcelain, antique cabinets, paintings, candelabra, trinkets and so many clocks that I lose count after the first 20. He says it's all a bit of fun, this collecting lark. Whenever I point to a piece, he recounts its history in detail. I ask him how much a cabinet is worth. His tongue darts over his top lip, his eyebrows ride up and down his huge forehead like dancing caterpillars. He puts his hand across his mouth and burbles bashfully, \"It's quite a nice piece actually.\" </p> <p>You don't often find him bashful. He certainly wasn't bashful in his 12-point manifesto, attacking the system of \"friends\" that means up to 80% of seats are already spoken for before they reach the box office; the broken promises to reduce prices and increase the number of shows. His office warns me that he has already said as much as he can say in the application, that I can't expect him to put the boot in any further. </p> <p>But how could Gubbay waste the opportunity? Perhaps I'm the ideal person for Gubbay to make his case to - late 30s, decent job, interested in the arts, wouldn't dream of going to Covent Garden. \"Part of the problem is that it doesn't touch you,\" he says. \"It's not very accessible. All this public money has gone into it ...\" And he's off. \"If you've got a public building with \u00a320m worth of subsidy thrown in and \u00a378.5m lottery money, the last thing you want is a structure that doesn't allow the maximum number of people to go to the box office and buy tickets.\" </p> <p>Then there is the run of disastrous managers. Genista McIntosh, for one. But didn't she leave because of bad health? \"It depends whose story you believe.\" What about the hoo-ha surrounding Mary Allen and Peter Gummer, latterly Lord Chadlington? \"Suddenly the people giving out the lottery money were at the receiving end because they were now running the Opera House. That was a disgrace, a quite appalling situation.\" </p> <p>And let's not forget Michael Kaiser, the current executive director. \"Six months after the Opera House reopened in December he'd given in his resignation. There's something clearly wrong with the structure of the place when the guy who I feel is doing a very good job within the parameters finds he doesn't want to stay on.\" </p> <p>And the current head, chairman Colin Southgate? \"Why the head of EMI should suddenly find himself running the Opera House without any accountability I can't understand.\" </p> <p>Problem. Southgate has a big say in choosing the new chief executive. Calling him names isn't going to help his cause is it? \"I'm afraid I'm not a crowd pleaser. If they don't want to hear the truth that's up to them.\" </p> <p>Everyone says that what they like about Gubbay is that he's straightforward. And he is. But he's also clever, calculating. And what better way of publicising yourself and your new Aida than applying for this job? He smiles. \"Well, why miss an opportunity? But the letter is not a joke. It's well constructed, literate if I say so myself.\" Will they give it due consideration? \"I don't know. They've never responded positively to anything I've said before. In one of the papers I saw that the press officer at the Opera House said they didn't even know if it was serious. Well surely they've learned by now that discretion is the better part of valour.\" Those amazing eyebrows go dancing again. </p> <p>Surely discretion works both ways, though? If he really wanted the job wouldn't he have been better off not leaking it to the world? \"No, I think I would have had less chance because it would have gone straight into the rubbish.\" At least, he says, this had opened up the debate. \"If the effect of my application is to lift the lid on this thing then that's a good thing. There's a great deal of anger felt by people about how this organisation has devoured vast sums of public money ... and I've not even started to talk to you about what happened during the closure period when they were paid their grant for not appearing ...\" </p> <p>Gubbay, who is 54, does not consider himself an opera buff even though he has dedicated most of his professional life to it. As a seven-year-old he failed grade one piano (\"And no one does that\"), but he liked his music. On Saturdays his grandmother would take him to the Golders Green Hippodrome to see musicals and ballets and D'Oyly Carte. His father wanted his youngest son to follow him into accountancy, and after Gubbay grabbed five O-levels he got himself articled. Eight months on, he was six months behind with his course work and he gave up. He eventually won himself a job working for impresario Victor Hochauser by answering three questions correctly - yes he went to school in north London, yes he was Jewish and yes he could start on Monday. By the mid-60s he was promoting his own shows. </p> <p>Bing! Dringgg! Brrr!! Gong! Ding! All the clocks are going, one after another. \"Don't take any notice. They're probably all wrong.\" He looks at his watch. \"That one's right, actually.\" Don't they drive him mad? \"No. I love it. It's the heartbeat of the house.\" </p> <p>Who lives in the house? \"Me, just me,\" he says quickly. There are pictures of children scattered around the room. Is he divorced? \"I'm divorced, yes, yes.\" Perhaps the clocks drove his wife away? \"Probably. Probably, it drove her out, yes. Though I don't think I had so many in those days.\" He laughs, but you sense Gubbay is a rather private man. </p> <p>His children are grown up, and until he died his father lived in a bungalow built for him in Gubbay's garden. Family is important to him. He talks about how one of his three grandchildren was born just before his mother, who had Alzheimer's, died. \"She was quite lucid at the end and saw my grandson. She said 'How lovely' ... the continuity of life.\" </p> <p>Gubbay likes to say that he was born in Cricklewood, brought up in Golders Green, married in Barnet, and divorced in Hadley Green. But he also has an apartment in the centre of Paris where he spends a couple of months a year enjoying the culture, the restaurants the antique shops. The suburban barrow boy is a bit of a closet bohemian. </p> <p>He tells me he read in the papers the other day that he was a multi-millionaire and wondered who on earth they were talking about. A couple of minutes later he admits that he almost sold his company for \"several million\" last year. </p> <p>The biggest reservation about Gubbay taking over as chief executive of Covent Garden is that he would bring his middle England staple to the Opera House. I tell him that a friend of mine said he had created opera for a new elite, opera for the fuel-protester class. He rocks his head back and laughs and laughs and laughs. \"I like that ... that is rather nice.\" The most radical part of his manifesto is to strip away subsidy, to use it only for specific projects such as encouraging children into the opera. \"Covent Garden gets by far the largest single grant, and many organisations are going out of business because they are not getting the subsidy, and their need is in the thousands rather than millions. If you can save some of this money at Covent Garden you can divert it to much more deserving causes.\" But without subsidy wouldn't the more adventurous stuff get dumped? \"There is a danger of overpopularising,\" he says. \"It's a delicate balance.\" But he has no intention of reducing the repertoire, and no he doesn't think it would be appropriate to impose singalonganopera nights on Covent Garden, \"though I don't think there's any harm in going out to market something in a different way.\" </p> <p>Gubbay tells me that tomorrow he's got a big day ahead of him. He is to receive a second honorary fellowship, this time from Trinity College of Music. He's tickled and excited. \"I'm in danger of becoming respectable,\" he says. Does that frighten him? \"It conjures up a picture of the establishment, which is anathema to me.\" Give that man the job.</p>",
  "Birds do it, bees do it and, according to the 2000 Durex Global Sex Survey, Brits do it, on average, 109 times per year. The survey covered 18,000 adults in 27 countries and its results, released last week, reveal that 43% of Britons make love between two and four times a week, while 5% claim to have sex at least once a day. Unmarried couples living together are the most sexually active of the lot, at 146 times per year. <p>Sex, it seems, is everywhere. In ads and on television, across magazine covers and in newspaper headlines. One could be forgiven for thinking we're all at it all the time and these figures seem to support that view. </p> <p>Or do they? According to the Durex survey, Americans have sex a grand total of 132 times per year - and yet last year, the world's most extensive sex survey since the Kinsey report, published by the Journal of American Medicine, revealed that of its 3,400 case studies, 40% of men and over 30% of women had absolutely no interest in sex. And you can be fairly sure that the majority of those uninterested individuals were firmly ensconced in long-term relationships. </p> <p>The sexlessness that often characterises committed relationships has become a taboo, particularly among the late twentysomething and early thirtysomething crowd - precisely the group who, according to the Durex survey, are making love the most (25-34-year-olds apparently average 113 times per year). Partly because the sexual status of a relationship is often seen as a barometer for the whole thing, but also because sex and youth are considered synonymous, admitting to a quasi-platonic relationship is like accepting that you no longer enjoy spending all night sweating class A drugs through every pore while lip-synching to Craig David. It's about ageing. </p> <p>\"It's such a terrible old clich\u00e9,\" says Karen, 31, who has sex \"very rarely\" with Michael, her boyfriend for over seven years. \"Dull, dried-up, sexless long-term relationship. Ten years ago, I couldn't have imagined a time when I'd simply not want sex any more.\" </p> <p>Michael, she thinks, is equally uninterested in rediscovering the kind of desperate passion that characterised the early stages of their relationship. \"It's not easy to discuss,\" she admits, \"but when I broach the subject, Michael says he's fine about it. We're not actually dull or dried up,\" she adds. \"We have a totally affectionate, cuddly relationship. It's not like we are cold with each other, we just hardly ever have sex - once every three months or so. Neither of us seems to mind in practice but I do worry what the theory says about us, that we are fundamentally wrong as a couple.\" </p> <p>According to Janice Hillner, psychosexual therapist and clinical psychologist, the absence of sex in a relationship isn't necessarily an indication of deep-rooted issues. \"It matters only if it matters. Sex every few months is as normal as sex every day - it becomes a problem only if there is an incompatibility between the two people.\" </p> <p>She points out that sex inevitably changes over the course of a relationship and that maybe those few early, heady months establish a false premise for the future. \"The passion, intensity and excitement you get from being with someone new is bound to subside when you get to know them well. For example, flirting only works between strangers who can project an image of themselves as they'd like to be. So the flirting goes a few months into the relationship and much of that build-up and excitement goes with it. It's normal.\" </p> <p>Professor Petruska Clarkson, a consultant psychologist and psychotherapist specialising in relationships, concedes that although a diminishing sex life can be the first indication of some deeper rot, this need not necessarily be the case and is potentially a dangerous idea because, by extension, it implies that it is worth sticking in a bad relationship if the sex is good. \"Men in particular can mistake a good sex life for emotional intimacy,\" she points out. \"They come to me saying: 'I don't see why she's complaining, we have a great sex life'.\" </p> <p>Yet, as normal as platonic or almost platonic relationships may be, there are branding issues surrounding them. The media peddles the myth of widespread rampancy. Women's magazines have policies concerning the minimum amount of times sex should be referred to on the cover of each issue. They convince you your sex life shouldn't change, that you're failing if it does, that there's always something you can do to re-inject the lust. It all goes a long way to creating pressure and angst, and the impression that if you've given up on sex, you've simply ceased to exist. </p> <p>\"I do actually get flickers of shame when I read sex surveys or watch Sex and the City,\" says Jane, a 29-year-old radio researcher from London, who hasn't had sex with her boyfriend Tim for over three years. \"I feel as though I have some awful secret. Why don't I want to start seducing Tim with Agent Provocateur underwear and smearing tiger balm on my genitals, like I'm supposed to? I sometimes raise the issue with friends, but run headlong into this bizarre barrier of sexual bravado. They're all apparently having spontaneous sex in the compost heap, so I end up qualifying what I wanted to discuss. I start saying: 'When I said we don't have any sex, obviously, I didn't mean ever.' Though that's actually precisely what I meant.\" </p> <p>Jane also finds it a difficult area to discuss with Tim. \"Sometimes I'd like to talk to him about it, but it's also totally understood that we don't talk about it. It would feel like a terrible intrusion.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile Lynn, 34, has problems coming to terms with the politics of her platonic relationship with husband Anton. \"I used to define myself in terms of my sex drive. I was proud of what it said about me - I genuinely loved sex and that made me genuinely liberated. Now I've lost interest and Anton and I have more or less stopped doing it, I feel like I've lost a substantial part of my identity, to him.\" </p> <p>So what is it that turns couples off sex? For a significant number, childbirth is the cause. Beyond the lifestyle disruption and sleeplessness, there may be pain, fear of getting pregnant again and feelings of squeamishness about your body or about penetration. </p> <p>But what if you and your partner are child-free? Popular belief has it that the libidos of many working couples are deflated by long hours and stress. But Dr Sidney Crumb, a consultant psychotherapist specialising in relationships and sexual problems, is inclined to think these are excuses. \"You don't actually have to work 12-hour days, do you?\" he says. </p> <p>Crumb believes a principal cause of sexual problems in relationships lies in women's ever evolving roles. \"A lot of men still feel threatened if a woman initiates sex,\" he points out, \"and a lot have problems if their partner is the principal wage-earner. I see the fallout from that every day.\" </p> <p>Maybe we just know too much now. Maybe the problem is that 21st-century sex is so loaded with politics and scientific data that we doubt our every sexual whim. While they may be useful, sex surveys and reports do influence the way we consider what we do with our bodies. They couch the things we once just liked but didn't think about much. What was once an interesting thing you did with rope becomes sadomasochism, with a whole associated behavioural pattern and psychological profile. Each tumble in the hay becomes a session with the mini shrink inside every one of us. In a long-term relationship, in which joint emotional histories are an inevitable factor, maybe it all just gets a bit too complicated. </p> <p>\u0095 All couples' names have been changed.</p>",
  "<p>Frank Gehry, architect of the much-lauded Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, was awarded the Royal Gold Medal for Architecture last week in the early 17th-century splendour of the Banqueting Hall, Whitehall. At 71, the Canadian-born architect has been around for some time, slowly evolving a style of architecture that is as curvaceous, as theatrical, and apparently as wilful as, say, the Baroque masters of the 17th century in Rome. In fact, one might say that Gehry is a Baroque architect of the turn of the 21st century. And, given that his most recently completed building is the Experience Music Project in Seattle, designed in the guise of what appears to be a melted-down cherry-red Fender Stratocaster, Baroque'n'roll is a label that suits him: full-blast, irreverent and, for the most part, pretty wonderful. </p> <p>His architecture is rightly popular among clients who have proved to be remarkably catholic in their taste and among a global public ever more greedy for sensation. Gehry really is of the moment: he has been conjuring the kind of fantastic architecture that global-brand-era capitalism feels it needs. In the same way, the glorious extravaganzas of Bernini, Borromini and Guarani gave the Roman Catholic church a shot in the surplice at the outset of the 17th century. </p> <p>Then the great religion was, in Latin countries, that of the one, true, universal church; 400 years on it is consumerism, leisure and their offspring, culture, as housed in thriving and ostentatious new galleries and museums. Where Borromini's curvaceous churches and Bernini's unashamedly erotic sculpture The Ecstasy of St Theresa (at the Capella Cornaro, St Maria della Vittoria, Rome) were designed covertly to inflame the excitement and ultimately the loyalty of the wealthy faithful, Gehry's exotic designs help keep the idea going that a collusion of ultra-wealth and culture is the high point of our society. </p> <p>In his acceptance speech last week, Gehry avoided pretty much all mention of the Bilbao Guggenheim; it has become almost too famous, the architectural equivalent of Frank Sinatra's My Way. Yet this truly iconic building - an icon of the capitalism-into-culture equation - has proved to be massively popular. It has whipped in the crowds and helped funnel investment into the Basque capital, most of it from the private sector. </p> <p>What Bernini did for Rome at the height of the Counter-Reformation, Gehry has done, in the design of one building, for Bilbao. </p> <p>Gehry's finest buildings are nearly all the products of private enterprise at its most confident. The Experience Music Project, which opened in June, was financed by Paul Allen, the Microsoft billionaire. The Guggenheim was a gift to Bilbao from the coffers of a New York plutocrat made rich decades ago on Yukon gold. Gehry's other European contributions - the Vitra design museum in Weil-am-Rhein, the Maggie Jencks cancer care centre in Dundee, the Marques de Riscal winery and hotel in Elciego (due to open in 2003) and the Neue Zollhof waterfront development in Dusseldorf - are the ripe fruit of wealthy private patrons or development corporations comfortably fed by big business. </p> <p>Gehry's effervescent approach to design will no doubt similarly appeal to a new generation of successful dot.com entrepreneurs. As capitalism goes into a kind of baroque overdrive, so the architecture that frames it has become increasingly flamboyant, from the casino strips of Las Vegas, through the profitable Po-Mo kitsch of Canary Wharf and New York's Battery Park, to the extravagant new wave of shopping malls, museums and galleries that have become part and parcel of the entertainment industry. </p> <p>This said, Gehry rarely fails to delight, and, just as you can't look at a 17th-century Roman Baroque church without thinking of the horrors of the Inquisition that lurked behind its whimsical split pediments and cutesy cherubs, so it is impossible not to revel in Gehry's irreverent artistry without thinking of the sheer might of the global industries that increasingly fuel this and other architecture like it. Like a successful advertising agency wooing a large public with controversial images and slogans, Gehry is, for all his outward flamboyance, a rationalist at heart. Just like the Baroque masters. </p> <p>In a quiet, self-deprecating talk last week, Gehry said that although he owed much to computer programming to help with the construction of his apparently convoluted buildings, he still believed in the primacy of good old-fashioned model making and the messy process of down-to-earth building. Most of the audience at the gold medal award last week would have been well aware of Gehry's roots as a clean-cut, four-square Modernist, who learned to find his own language, one that does for modern museums and business institutions what that dress did for Elizabeth Hurley. </p> <p>It is harder, of course, to imagine Gehry being invited to let rip in Little England. His taste may be rather too Las Vegas for London, Liverpool or Leeds. When British architects did go Baroque - in the late 17th century with Wren, Hawksmoor, Vanbrugh and co - their style, with the exception of Vanbrugh, who had travelled extensively, was far more chaste than that of their Latin counterparts. This is partly because they were building for a Protestant establishment and partly a question of gentlemanly restraint. Significantly, these architects took their cue from Inigo Jones (1573-1652), the unrepentantly Catholic architect who designed the peerless Banqueting Hall under whose lavish ceiling Gehry received his gold medal. Jones, a designer of court masques, had spent several years in Italy, notably in Venice, but although surrounded by increasingly voluptuous new churches and palaces, he believed that architecture \"should be solid, proportional according to the rules [of the classical orders], masculine and unaffected\". Yet his revolutionary buildings - and, above all, the Banqueting House in the heart of half-timbered Jacobean London - would have been as shockingly new when completed in 1622 as Gehry's Bilbao Guggenheim was to be 375 years later. </p> <p>What if Gehry were to receive a major commission in these islands? Would the spirit of Jones and Wren lure him into a quieter, Protestant Baroque? Possibly. Certainly the medal ceremony, despite the fleshy excess of the Rubens ceiling billow ing above the audience, remained a cosily low-key English affair. No massive, US-style prize money, no extravagant speeches; just a school prize day atmosphere in which a small, white-haired septuagenarian mumbled through an address that belied what he has been doing outside the Portland stone walls of the Banqueting Hall - creating some of the most theatrical and in-your-face architecture this side of Bernini.</p>",
  "Salvage experts engaged in the difficult and extremely sensitive operation to recover corpses from the sunken Russian submarine Kursk pierced the inner hull of the nuclear vessel for the first time yesterday and found a less threatening environment than had been feared. <p>The combined teams of Russian and Norwegian divers, who started descending over 100 metres to the Kursk on the Barents sea bed on Friday, cut through the outer hull, stripped away a layer of industrial rubber casing designed to maximise the vessel's stealth, and pierced the tougher inner hull at the stern. </p> <p>Russian navy spokesmen reported that the rescue workers found \"pure water\" inside one compartment. There were no traces of fuel nor of increased radiation from the submarine's two nuclear reactors. </p> <p>Six teams of three divers are working round the clock from a diving platform, resembling a large mobile oil rig, which arrived at the scene of the disaster off the coast of Murmansk on Friday. </p> <p>The recovery effort is being run by the Norwegian arm of the US oil services company Halliburton, but the divers cutting their way into the submarine are Russian. </p> <p>Russia is profoundly ambivalent about the entire operation which is aimed at redeeming President Vladimir Putin's pledge to the families of the 118 dead seamen in August that the corpses would be recovered. </p> <p>Russian navy officers and government officials are braced for failure and, indeed, appear determined to emphasise the gravity of every problem that crops up in what is an extremely difficult operation in bad weather and poor visibility. </p> <p>The Russian pessimism contrasts with the brisk, can-do attitude of the Norwegians. </p> <p>\"Like in the aftermath of the disaster, the political and military leadership seem to think that the public is not ready for the truth,\" commented the Nezavisimaya Gazeta daily newspaper. </p> <p>In the grief-stricken days after two still unexplained explosions during northern fleet exercises sank the Kursk on August 12, the relatives insisted on trying to raise the corpses. But most would now prefer to leave the remains of their relatives on the seabed. </p> <p>The best that can be expected is that the bodies of a few of the 118 may be brought up for burial on land. The navy and government chiefs give the distinct impression that they would prefer to call off the recovery mission, but have neither the courage nor authority to say so. </p> <p>\"Only Vladimir Putin can call off the risky operation in the Barents sea,\" said the liberal opposition newspaper, Segodnya.</p>",
  "More than 150 years after California was lost by Mexico to the United States, the state is to become a battleground again. But this time the bombardment will be conducted over the television airwaves as George W Bush digs into his war chest and claims that the greatest prize in the presidential race is within his grasp. <p>The Golden State is indeed the richest trophy in the battle for the White House. It brings the victor 54 electoral college votes out of the total of the 270 needed - as many as the three key states of Florida, Michigan and Wisconsin put together. </p> <p>At the last election, Bill Clinton carried California comfortably with 51% of the vote to Bob Dole's 38%, Ross Perot's 7% and Ralph Nader's 2%. </p> <p>Local polls have shown Mr Gore comfortably ahead but now the Bush team has announced that its private polls show the gap to be as small as 6% and they are to spend $1.5m (\u00a31m) a week on commercials in the final stretch of the campaign. The Texas governor will also be hitting the state to try to motivate the undecided. </p> <p>In addition, a national Bush campaign in Spanish will be seen as directed very much at California where 25% of the population of 31m is now Latino, traditionally regarded as Democratic supporters. </p> <p>\"The polls definitely reflect a shift from Gore and his lead is now only in single digits,\" said Lindsey Kozberg of the California Bush/Cheney 2000 campaign. \"We are finding that California voters are very much attracted to Governor Bush's educational programme and also to his reform of social security and Medicare and his policy on the defence industry.\" </p> <p>She said that the polls over the last week indicated a definite swing to Bush which now meant that a state that had been virtually written off as Democrat two months ago was now seen as worth courting, particularly as it last went Republican in 1988 for George Bush Sr. </p> <p>At the Democrats' California campaign offices, the mood is sanguine. \"We welcome their decision to waste money here in California,\" said spokesman Peter Ragone. </p> <p>\"The reason he will not win in California is that he is in the hip-holster of the National Rifle Association,\" he said. \"Our message to Bush is 'keep the mess in Texas not in California'.\" He added that Al Gore's record on the environment was one key factor in ensuring that the state would remain with the Democrats. </p> <p>Commentators doubt whether Mr Bush has a serious chance and see the push as strategic, aimed at keeping up the percentage of the Republican vote, aiding Republicans running for office in the Senate and Congress and having a psychological impact on the Gore campaign in that it creates an impression nationally that, if California is vulnerable, then Gore must be in real trouble. </p> <p>California is also one of the states where Mr Nader, the Green party candidate, would hope to do well but he is still hovering at around 5% in the polls as more and more left-leaning organisations and publications urge a Gore vote for fear of a Bush victory. </p> <p>Californians have good reasons for going to the polls that involve neither Mr Bush nor Mr Gore. Two propositions concerning drugs and schools have activated many voters and the spin-off may be a higher turnout than usual that may have national repercussions. </p> <p>Proposition 36 is a radical move that would mean that non-violent drug offenders who were neither selling nor manufacturing drugs would be given treatment and probation instead of prison. This is opposed by the prison guards' union who have found an unlikely ally in the normally liberal actor Martin Sheen, currently enjoying great success as the fictional president in the television series West Wing. </p> <p>Sheen, whose son had drug problems, argues that only the threat of prison works and has been appearing on commercials to call for a No vote. The other contentious proposition, 38, would introduce a school voucher system that would allow parents to take $4,000 (\u00a32,750) worth of vouchers to the private school of their choice, thus removing their child from the state system. </p> <p>What worries some candidates is the sheer number of votes people are asked to cast with 32 different choices for a voter to make in Los Angeles alone. An indication of the constituencies to which candidates must appeal is reflected in the number of languages printed on the ballot: Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Tagalog, Vietnamese and Spanish. </p> <p>Spice has been added to the presidential race by the opening last week of the film The Contender, starring Joan Allen and Gary Oldman. Allen plays a strong and honourable Democratic vice-presidential candidate and Oldman an unattractive and creepy Republican at odds with each other over allegations of sexual high jinks. </p> <p>The film, which was re-edited by DreamWorks, whose founders are all big Democra tic party supporters, has been accused of being a political commercial for the Democrats timed to hit the voters subliminally just as they make up their minds about voting.</p>"
