  "The families of the victims of the Omagh bomb have spent a year trying to raise \u00a32 million to launch a civil case against the terrorists responsible. <p>Ahead of a meeting with Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson tomorrow, The Observer can reveal that relatives of the 29 men, women and children killed in the atrocity have now raised sufficient funds. </p> <p>The families have also been in negotiations with the Daily Mail for several months over the paper's proposed fundraising campaign to help the Omagh bomb relatives take civil actions against those suspected of being behind the massacre. </p> <p>They said talks between their lawyers and the paper began long before BBC1's Panorama named four of the suspects connected with the atrocity. The police think they know the identities of the terrorists responsible, but say they have insufficient evidence to prosecute. </p> <p>The families had approached the Mail to set up a fighting fund for justice because the paper had backed similar campaigns in the past. They were impressed at the way the Mail supported the family of the murdered black teenager Stephen Lawrence in their fight to bring his killers to justice. </p> <p>Last year The Observer revealed that a number of the Omagh families were consulting lawyers to see if they could take civil actions in the courts against Real IRA suspects. </p> <p>'We have yet to decide whether that action is a criminal injuries case, a civil prosecution or a war crimes case in the International Court of Justice in The Hague. But we need money to fight for justice and our lawyers estimate the costs could be up to \u00a32 million. We want to strip these people of their assets and name and shame all of them around the world. The Mail 's fighting fund will help us to do that,' said Michael Gallagher, whose son Adrian was killed in the bombing. </p> <p>At their meeting with Mandelson, the relatives will ask him to put pressure on America to put the Real IRA on its list of global terror groups. </p> <p>Including the Real IRA on the list would bar them and their political allies, the 32 County Sovereignty Committee, from fundraising in America. </p> <p>The list includes the group led by the Saudi fundamentalist Osama bin Laden, the Palestinian rejectionist group Hamas and other Middle Eastern terrorist organisations. </p> <p>Michael Gallagher, who will be accompanied to the lunch by Stanley McCombe, whose wife Anne was killed in the bomb, said: 'The primary point we want to raise with Mr Mandelson is why the Irish government opposed placing the Real IRA on the Americans' global terrorist list. We want him to ask the US government to ignore the Irish government's opposition and of course we want him to persuade Dublin to change its attitude on this question.' </p> <p>He said the families were furious over allegations that Dublin interfered with the inquiry to prevent the Irish police using potential 'supergrass witnesses'.</p>",
  "The human form of mad cow disease claimed its youngest victim yesterday as it emerged that potentially lethal BSE-infected waste is leaking into the environment from the carcasses of infected cattle. <p>Zoe Jeffries, a sports-mad 14-year-old who loved cheeseburgers, became victim number 82 of the epidemic that broke out after the Government repeatedly misled the public about the dangers of eating beef until a ban was announced in 1996. </p> <p>Zoe's death was announced yesterday by a Greater Manchester police spokesman, who said: 'Ms Jeffries had been diagnosed some time ago as suffering from vCJD, the human form of BSE. She died this morning at her home. Her family would like to work through this difficult period with as much privacy and dignity as possible.' </p> <p>Harrowing footage of Zoe, lying sedated and uncomprehending as her mother and three younger sisters took turns to stroke her hair, was released ahead of the Government's BSE report published last week, which revealed an astonishing level of cover-ups to prevent the public knowing the truth about the scale of the disease. </p> <p>The pictures showed Zoe lying in a metal-sided bed in her Wigan home, with posters of Leonardo DiCaprio around her. Stroking her hair, Helen, Zoe's mother, said: 'It's just as if someone had stuck a knife into Zoe's body. I really do think she has been murdered.' </p> <p>Her mother also expressed guilt because she frequently fed her children beefburgers. </p> <p>'I can't remember the makes I bought but they were the cheapest ones. Zoe ate them probably three times a week from the age of two-and-a-half until she was five. It's what she liked to eat. I bought mince and shepherd's pies.' </p> <p>As Zoe's death was announced, the scale of a possible CJD epidemic was being reassessed. A 74-year-old man who died last year was yesterday confirmed to have had the disease. </p> <p>The death has triggered questions over whether a larger section of society than initially thought could be vulnerable to the disease. Medical professionals are being urged to be 'more vigilant' about causes of death among the elderly, a Department of Health spokesman said. </p> <p>The news of the latest fatalities came as an Observer investigation discovered that BSE-infected ash is escaping from incinerators burning slaughtered cattle as well as dumps storing mountains of cow carcasses. </p> <p>Sources have revealed Environment Agency fears that a Lincolnshire incinerator burning 250 tonnes of cattle a day since April is not destroying the infective BSE protein which transmits the disease to humans. </p> <p>Tests carried out by Environment Agency officials on ash from one incinerator have found potentially lethal proteins in the residue. The agency has demanded that Fibrogen, the company which owns the incinerator, 'identifies measures to improve the combustion of the material' and 'design and install' new equipment. </p> <p>The ash containing the BSE proteins is being put on trucks, driven to Scunthorpe and dumped in a landfill site in the North Lincolnshire village of Winterton. </p> <p>It has also emerged that the Environment Agency is investigating the storage of thousands of tonnes of cattle carcasses in an old bowling alley in Blyton, Lincolnshire. </p> <p>Photographic and video evidence taken by local residents show trucks leaving the dump covered with cow remains. One photo shows maggots on the truck. The agency has confirmed its legal team is considering action against the owners. </p> <p>Mandy Thompson, who lives in Blyton, said: 'This material carries the risk of a hideous and incurable disease. It is diabolical what is happening. We have always been told that it is safe and that none of this material can escape, but we've seen trucks coming out of the depot covered in the stuff.' </p> <p>These problems highlight the continued public health hazard caused by BSE and the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of older cattle a year under a government scheme designed to halt the spread of mad cow disease. </p> <p>After the BSE scandal erupted in 1996, the Government demanded that all cattle over 30 months should be destroyed even if they showed no signs of BSE. </p> <p>The fear was that older cattle were most likely to be incubating the disease and the Ministry of Agriculture estimates that 1 per cent might be contaminated. </p> <p>The original plan was for the carcasses to be boiled, mashed up and then burnt in a furnace at a temperature of more than 1,000 Celsius to kill the BSE protein. </p> <p>But until this April there was only one incinerator, in Southampton, capable of burning the cattle remains at such a temperature. </p> <p>As a result 'mad cow mountains' have been building up in secret warehouses around the country which now hold more than 400,000 tonnes of BSE waste. </p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.bse.org.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">BSE Inquiry</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.bsereview.org.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">Food Standards Agency BSE Review</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.maff.gov.uk/animalh/bse\" target=\"_NEW\">MAFF BSE site</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.doh.gov.uk/cjd\" target=\"_NEW\">Department of Health BSE/CJD site</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.humanbse.org.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">Human BSE Foundation - voluntary support group</a><br> <a href=\"http://sparc.airtime.co.uk/bse\" target=\"_NEW\">BSE news and research</a></p>",
  "Billy McIntyre tried to stick to his routine on Wednesday night. At about 7pm he left his terraced house on a quiet estate in the north of Aberdeen and made the 10-minute journey up the hill to the city's royal infirmary. <p>For an hour and a half he sat with his daughter Donna, aged 21, who has been in hospital since being diagnosed with new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in September. As usual, he chatted with her, tickled her, and tousled her hair to keep her animated. </p> <p>When he returned home he could not stomach the thought of dinner. He made do with a cup of tea, and tried to concentrate on the television. At 8am the next day, McIntyre rose, washed and dressed before going into the kitchen for some breakfast. He turned on the radio and waited. It was a long, slow morning. At 12.32pm, Nick Brown, the agriculture secretary, rose to announce publication of the public inquiry into Britain's BSE epidemic. </p> <p>'I was emotional all the way through the announcement,' McIntyre said. 'I was crying a lot. Some of that was relief that the answers were coming out. But mainly it was anger because the report was so damning. I'm not going to congratulate ministers on this report because the whole thing should never have been allowed to happen. I don't even accept their apology.' McIntyre's daughter will be dead in months. </p> <p>David Bee had never seen anything like it. The cow was arching its back, waving its head from side to side. It was pitifully thin. His colleague, Mike Teale, had told him of being chased by a similarly afflicted beast which had 'chased him across the box on her knees'. </p> <p>It was three days before Christmas, 1984. Bee, a well-known local vet, had been called to Pitsham Farm on the South Downs by its owner, Peter Stent. Stent was worried. One of his cows was ill. He had no idea what it was. </p> <p>When Bee arrived, he was not sure what to think. Maybe there was a local problem with mercury poisoning Stent's herd. Maybe it was a kidney disease. Nobody knew then, but Stent's sick animal would soon become famous as 'Cow 133'. In the heart of farming country, Bee was staring into the eyes of a disaster. </p> <p>He never expected a walk-on part in the story of Britain's biggest public health scandal. Most of the locals knew him as an enthusiastic 'joiner-in' at church in his picturesque village of West Liss. His bright tone made him a favourite when it came to reading out passages from the Bible. </p> <p>Cow 133 was the first case of BSE, bovine spongiform encephalopathy. Sixteen years and sixteen volumes of public inquiry later, the Government stands accused of failing the public. Bureaucracy, caution and secrecy has led, slowly and painfully, to the realisation that the structures in place to protect the people had simply not worked. </p> <p>Last week, Lord Phillips' report into how a disease in cows became a tragedy for humans shone a light into the deepest recesses of government operation. Debate so far has focused on the surface story, the missed opportunities and confused messages which allowed an ugly sore to fester. </p> <p>That story was contained in Volume 1 of Lord Phillips' inquiry. But there are 15 other volumes, thousands of pages of memos and secret deals, legal challenges and stand-up rows that reveal how government really works - and not always work in the public's interest. Not since the Scott inquiry into the Arms to Iraq affair has Britain seen such a damning indictment of its public 'servants'. </p> <p>Carol Richardson had just returned from holiday in September 1995. A pathologist at the government's Central Veterinary Laboratory, she was asked to study the brain of an adult cow from Pitsham Farm, one that Bee had seen. After looking at slides of the brain she confirmed that it showed characteristics of a 'spongiform encephalopathy', BSE. It was the start. </p> <p>Richardson sought a second opinion from a colleague, Dr Martin Jeffrey. She left the slides on his work bench in the laboratory and went to lunch. On her return, Jeffrey had left a note by one of the slides. 'Bovine scrapie' he wrote, referring to the BSE-type disease common in sheep. </p> <p>Richardson's boss, Gerald Wells, was at a meeting in Cheshire when she made her astonishing finding. On his return he read the report. 'I agreed with her,' he said simply. The following April further evidence emerged from a farm in Kent. Something big was happening. </p> <p>How should the Government vets deal with it? The head of pathology department at the CVL was Ray Bradley. With initial results showing that a new, potentially fatal, disease had been discovered, the initial policy was clear. Bradley sent a memo to Dr William Watson, CVL director, and Dr Brian Shreeve, director of research. This is what it said: </p> <p>'If the disease turned out to be bovine scrapie it would have severe repercussions to the export trade and possibly also for humans if for example it was discovered that humans with spongiform encephalopathies had close association with cattle. It is for these reasons that I have classified this document confidential. At present I would recommend playing it low key.' </p> <p>New cases kept dribbling in. It was suggested that information should be passed around, the usual method when new scientific discoveries are made. The veterinary journals - Vision, the in-house magazine for the Government's veterinary service, and Veterinary Record - were suggested as forums for this exhange. But permission was withdrawn. Plans to give information to universities and outside research bodies were also blocked. </p> <p>Why? By getting the information out in the public domain, there would be a greater chance of understanding what the vets were dealing with and of estimating how widespread the problem was. The reasoning by the officials was clear. 'Because of the nature of the disorder, its political implications and possible effects on exports,' said Dr Bernard Williams, head of the Government's veterinary investigation service. Cards would be played very close to the chest. </p> <p>By the end of May 1987, with Margaret Thatcher's third election victory a matter of weeks away, there were six positive cases of BSE and 13 suspected cases. It was well over two years since Bee had first set eyes on Cow 133. The problem was growing. Ministers had still not been told. </p> <p>On June 1, William Rees, the chief veterinary officer and as such one of the most powerful men in the Ministry for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, wrote to Donald Thompson, MAFF's parliamentary secretary, about BSE. </p> <p>'Irresponsible or ill-informed publicity is likely to be unhelpful since it might lead to hysterical demands for immediate, draconian government measures and could lead to a rejection of UK exports,' he said. </p> <p>'It does not seem appropriate at this stage for MAFF to issue general information. The political implication are serious, particularly if not handled correctly.' </p> <p>That line became the leitmotif of the Government's response to an approaching storm. Economics were the main concern and the farming industry needed to be protected. People could be easily alarmed, the civil service thought. Better secrecy than public hysteria. By the end of August, 1987, 46 more probable cases of BSE had been identified. By the middle of September it was 73. By the end of October, 120. Farming newspapers published the first articles about an 'incurable disease wiping out dairy cows'. By the end of November, there were 243 suspected cases. </p> <p>The public were oblivious to the danger. Richard Sibley, chairman of the British Cattle Veterinary Association, said: 'Throughout most of 1986 and 1987 most veterinary surgeons who were in the front line of disease diagnosis and control were ignorant of the presence of this disease and were not informed of its clinical signs or its significance as a potential national disease problem.' </p> <p>By the end of March 1988, 600 probable cases of BSE had been reported. The Government's mind was made up: scrapie in sheep had never jumped species to man, despite being known about for 200 years. BSE wouldn't either. </p> <p>As usual, John MacGregor's red box of weekend reading was overflowing. It was February 1988 and the secretary of state for agriculture had a two busy days of meetings and business ahead. </p> <p>In his ministerial papers was a document from John Suich of MAFF's animal health division. The BSE problem was becoming serious, numbers were rising alarmingly. Suich suggested that a slaughter compensation scheme should be agreed for farmers, who were increasing disquiet about a disaster developing in their midst. </p> <p>Two months earlier, MacGregor had received a letter from Lord Montagu of Beaulieu, a landowner. 'There is nothing which prevents veterinary officers from certifying the carcass of an animal infected with this disease as fit for human consumption. I understand little research has been done on whether this disease can be transmitted to humans through the consumption of beef from infected animals. Until this is known it seems quite wrong to sell infected carcasses for this purpose.' It was the first time the public health link had been made. </p> <p>Suich's memo to MacGregor tackled the issue. 'I would be reluctant to say the risk [to human health] is negligible. One theory is that BSE may have originated from sheep affected with scrapie. If this theory is correct we have to face up to the possibility that the disease could cross another species gap.' </p> <p>This view would not be made public for another eight years. MAFF considered it too dangerous for the multi-billion pound farming industry. </p> <p>MacGregor read Suich's comments on the slaughter and compensation deal. In the margins, more as an aide-m\u00e9moire than anything else, he noted that there was a need for caution. How much would a slaughter and compensation scheme cost? Would analogies be made with other farming problems, such as rhizomania in sugar beet which was devastating crops, leaving the Government open to heavy compensation claims? Treasury was unlikely to agree to funding the scheme if there was no evidence that there was a risk to human health. For MacGregor, the former chief secretary to the Treasury, economics were of primary concern. </p> <p>MAFF officials took this to mean that the scheme was off the agenda. In a letter to the Chief Medical Officer, Sir Donald Acheson, they failed to make it clear that they urgently wanted a slaughter and compensation scheme. They simply said they wanted Acheson's thoughts on the possible health implications of BSE. Acheson himself confessed that he felt irritated at the incredibly short notice he had been given to come up with such an important opinion. </p> <p>'To be, off the cuff, asking the CMO, at a moment's notice, personally to give advice to take diseased cattle out of the food chain is a gross misunderstanding of the nature of the job,' Acheson later told the inquiry. </p> <p>His feelings were nothing compared with Dr Hilary Pickles, the principal medical officer at the Department of Health. How, she asked, was the department supposed to fulfil its role when MAFF didn't keep them informed? </p> <p>'The most serious delay was in informing DH in the first place,' she said. 'The Central Veterinary Laboratory were aware of a new disease in January 1987, they informed their ministers in June 1987 but wrote to us only on 3 March 1988, by which time they had 500 cases.' Pickles was furious. Inter-departmental jealousies meant that MAFF wanted to keep BSE within its sphere of influence. </p> <p>The civil service had fallen into what is known along the corridors of Whitehall as 'shaded-opinion'. When officials feel they know the mind of the minister, all options are couched in terms that the minister is likely to agree to. MAFF officials didn't tell Acheson of their own feelings on the issue of compensation because they thought MacGregor's mind was made up. It wasn't. </p> <p>'I am a little surprised to find significance attached to things which were an aide-m\u00e9moire to me,' MacGregor said later of his notes scribbled in the margins. On such misunderstandings are problems built. It was another five months of delay and circulating memos before the slaughter scheme was finally agreed. In that time hundreds of infected carcasses had entered the food chain. </p> <p>With Acheson and Pickles' opinions clear, Bradley knew pressure was growing on MAFF to give information more widely to the medical profession. In September 1987 he dropped a note to Watson suggesting publishing an article about BSE in the medical journal the Lancet. 'There are of course pros and cons,' Bradley said. 'What do you think?' </p> <p>Watson replied. 'Not at present. It would over-emphasise the possible link to human spongiform encephalopathies.' So the public remained ignorant. </p> <p>MAFF were determined to hold the line that beef was perfectly safe to eat. A week after Bradley's Lancet request, Rees knew that '[the DoH] are aware of the problem and have informally expressed some concern about any possible human health risks,' he wrote in a progress report to MacGregor. But less than a month later, Suich circulated this memo to press officers in case they had to answer questions on BSE. </p> <p>'Q: Can it be transmitted to humans?' </p> <p>'A: There is no evidence that it is transmissable to humans.' </p> <p>There was no evidence, but there were concerns. It was MAFF's policy not to reveal them. </p> <p>A cow's death is seldom pretty. In the Eighties most of Britain's 1,000 abbatoirs had adopted a 'production-line' system for killing, blood-letting and cutting up cows. </p> <p>Beasts ready for slaughter would arrive at a holding area. They would be lined up between metal fences, single file, and fed into a pen. A bolt would be fired into the animal's brain, followed by a pithing rod, a pronged instrument which would cause further damage to the brain and spinal cord to stop the animal kicking. Hoisted up by the hind legs, the cow's neck would be slit, the head cut off and the offal removed. Meat would then be processed in one direction, and the mass of guts and blood would go to a different department. Everything was used for either animal or human consumption. </p> <p>In October 1992, John Gummer, then the secretary of state for agriculture, was called before the agriculture select committee. Sitting before them in the House of Commons, Gummer was asked about hygiene standards for killing cattle. Reading from reports from environmental officers charged with inspecting slaughter houses, Gummer said: </p> <p>'We have real problems with our slaughter houses.' He turned to one of the officer's reports. 'Slaughter hall floor heavily soiled with blood, gut contents and other debris - no attempt to clean up between carcasses. Car cleaning brush heavily contaminated with blood and fat being used to wash carcasses. Offal rack and carcass rails encrusted with dirt. Missing windows - birds, flies and vermin entering. Effluent discharging across floor - risk of contamination.' Faeces was often found smeared over the dead bodies of the cows. </p> <p>A year earlier, Gummer had warned Prime Minister John Major that 60 per cent of slaughter houses did not meet European standards. </p> <p>It mattered. In November 1989, the Government had ordered that brains and spinal cords of cows should be prevented from entering the human food chain. Brain and spinal cord were thought to contain the infective BSE material. It became known as the specific bovine offal ban. </p> <p>The removal of the spinal cord was a tricky business. Cows had to be sawn neatly in two. The safety of the public was dependent on men with knives with electric saws and stun guns, killing and cutting up cows in chaotic conditions. There was widespread evidence that remains of spinal cords were entering the food chain, in reports given to MAFF and the DoH in 1995. </p> <p>'We asked MAFF officials whether evidence of poor hygiene standards in slaughter houses did not raise concerns about the standard of enforcement of the duty to remove the spinal cord from the carcass,' Lord Phillips said. 'Each replied that it did not.' </p> <p>Even with the evidence that the slaughter house system was filthy, MAFF and the department of healt stuck to the line that beef was perfectly safe to eat. </p> <p>On a warm pring evening in May 1990, Gerald Wells received a telephone call. It was the chief veterinary officer, Keith Meldrum. Wells, a senior member of the Central Veterinary Laboratory, was asked about his discovery of a BSE-type disease in a cat in Bristol. </p> <p>Wells said that it had 'profound implications' for the Government's line on BSE's possible effects on people. Other experts argued that if a cat had 'caught' BSE, probably from eating infected offal crushed up in pet food, people could be next. Meldrum held a meeting with Gummer at which they agreed that the Government had to hold the line. They said there was 'no likely connection' between the cat and BSE. Such stubbornness was to continue for another six years. </p> <p>Over the next three years, finding after finding undermined the foundations of the Government's policy. And every time, the Government sort to shore up its own rickety structure with assurances that beef was completely safe. </p> <p>In August 1990 scientists successfully transferred BSE to a pig. In March 1993 the Lancet reported that the first dairy farmer had died CJD, the human equivalent of BSE. That month Kenneth Calman, the chief medical officer, issued a statement saying that beef was safe to eat. </p> <p>'Dr Calman was seeking to address fears that a farmer had somehow caught BSE from his cattle,' the Phillips report says. 'Responding to such fears by emphasising that it was safe to eat beef naturally carried the inference that transmission of the disease from cow to human was impossible. </p> <p>'Dr Calman should have been careful not to suggest such a belief, for he considered that there was a real potential for BSE to move from cows to humans.' </p> <p>Then came Vicky Rimmer. Early in summer 1993 she fell ill with a degenerative disease which mystified her doctors. By mid-September she was blind and had fallen into a coma. She would become another fatal CJD statistic. </p> <p>On 26 January, 1994, press reporting of Vicky's case was causing alarm. Calman was again pressed into action with the encouragement of MAFF and made another reassuring statement. 'On the basis of the work done so far there is not the slightest evidence that eating beef or hamburgers caused CJD,' he said. Phillips said that the strength with which Calman made the point was 'somewhat more emphatic than desirable'. </p> <p>Why was Calman wheeled out so regularly? A briefing paper from Douglas Hogg, the secretary of state for agriculture in 1995, to Major reveals the thinking. 'The Chief Medical Officer and the Chief Veterinary Officer ought to be by far the most convincing spokesmen for the Government on the question of whether BSE could be transmitted to humans from infected meat.' Politicians weren't trusted, so Britain's faith in experts had to be tested to the limit. </p> <p>In the second half of 1995, two more dairy farmers died of CJD, bringing the total to four. The committee of experts brought together by the Government to advise them on BSE and CJD said they were now looking at something greater than a chance phenomenon. One official suggested that maybe the farmers had eaten the infected cattle feed they were giving to their herds. Holding the line was getting difficult. </p> <p>Another blow came. Two more teenagers had been diagnosed with CJD. The media smelt scandal. Confidence had to be rebuilt, ministers had to go on the attack. </p> <p>In December, Stephen Dorrell, the health secretary, appeared on Jonathan Dimbleby's ITV political programme on ITV to do just that. </p> <p>'So there is no conceivable risk from what is now in the food chain?' Dimbleby asked. Dorrell thought about his reply carefully, mindful that a word out of place could bring the Government's policy down around his ears. 'That is the position,' he said. Dorrell admitted later that his words 'had gone too far'. </p> <p>Hogg was worried. Public confidence in beef was taking a battering. He demanded a campaign to convince the public that eating beef was safe. He asked the scientific committee of advisers, supposedly independent, to answer a series of questions. 'This was not because he wished to know the answers,' Lord Phillips said. 'It was in the hope that the answers would be suitable to publish in order to give reassurance to those who are worried about the safety of eating beef.' </p> <p>Colin MacLean, the director general of the Meat and Livestock Commission, wrote to one of the committee, Dr Richard Kimberlin. </p> <p>'We agree that we need succinct answers to these questions and my colleagues in our PR company have drafted the sort of answers they would like to see (although they cannot put words into [the committee's] mouth!).' </p> <p>The MLC is charged with promoting beef in Britain. Kimberlin, a government adviser, was also a paid consultant for the MLC. Phillips says of MacLean's reassuring words on the safety of eating beef that 'hyperbole had replaced accuracy'. </p> <p>The rows were beginning. As more and more cases of CJD appeared, the DoH was getting increasingly nervous. But to keep the beef industry and exports from collapse MAFF ploughed on. </p> <p>By the end of February 1996, just a month before Hogg had to get up in the Commons and announce a link between BSE and a new form of CJD in people, MAFF prepared a leaflet to reassure the public. On the front page it stated: 'Two facts should be made absolutely clear. Fact 1: there is currently no scientific evidence to indicate a link between BSE and CJD. Fact 2: the independent expert committee set up to advise the Government on all aspects of BSE is satisfied that British beef is safe to eat.' </p> <p>Dr Ailsa Wight, a department of health expert on BSE, was shown the leaflet and was asked whether the DoH might like to jointly issue it with MAFF. Wight passed the request on to Dr Jeremy Metters, the deputy chief medical officer. He was furious. </p> <p>'Some statements are too definite and in time may be seen to be wrong,' he wrote in a memo to Wight. 'We should not follow MAFF's hyperbole of reassurance. We must leave ministers and CMO in particular an escape route if any of these statements turns out to be WRONG.' </p> <p>As the inter-departmental battles intensified, the number of young people catching CJD was increasing. Dr Robert Will, the leading expert in CJD from the Government supported CJD Surveillance Unit in Edinburgh, had depressing news. These cases of CJD were unlike any other. There was something going on. </p> <p>On a damp evening early in March, 1996, Richard Packer, the permanent secretary at MAFF, walked into Hogg's cavernous office on the corner of Smith Square in Westminster. It was late, but Packer had some bad news. 'There is a very dark cloud on the horizon,' he told Hogg. 'SEAC [the Government advisory committee] think, or are coming to the view, that BSE might be transmissible.' </p> <p>Hogg paused as the import of what Packer was saying sunk in. 'This is a very serious state of affairs,' he said. </p> <p>Calman was told. Meldrum was told. Beef was not safe. Hogg prepared to make a statement to Parliament as soon as possible. If this leaked out, the Government would be finished. It was agreed that Dorrell would make the first statement and Hogg would follow. For the first time in the whole disaster, the considerations of the DoH were put ahead of those of MAFF. </p> <p>On 20 March, at 3.31pm, Dorrell rose from the green Government benches in the Commons chamber. He said that a new form of CJD had been discovered and that, despite there being no firm scientific evidence that it had come from eating beef, SEAC concluded that the cases were linked to eating infected meat in the Eighties. </p> <p>At 4.17pm, Hogg made his statement, saying that all cattle over 30 months would be slaughtered. In that one day billions of pounds were wiped off the value of Britain's beef industry. Incinerators worked night and day burning cattle. Pictures of bovine funeral pyres led the news day after day as hundreds of herds were burnt. Farmers were ruined. Many have never recovered. </p> <p>The Government had finally been caught out. From day one, convinced by the theory that scrapie had never been transmitted to man from sheep, and that therefore BSE could not be transmitted either, they drew a line in the sand and refused to cross it. Even when the scrapie theory was proved wrong - BSE actually came from a genetic mutation in cattle in the Seventies and was passed on by feeding cow remains to herds as animal feed - they refused to budge. </p> <p>Economics guided them. The public could not be trusted to make up their own mind. Science found it impossible to prove a link, so there was always an opportunity for more research. More delay and more reassuring noises. </p> <p>Eventually the weight of evidence overwhelmed the Government's defences. But even at the very last, there were those arguing that a cattle cull could be 'disproportionately expensive' given the number of cases of CJD (then 10). These were men trying to bale out out the Titanic with a teaspoon. </p> <p>Sixty miles away, David Bee must have greeted the news with horror. On a cold Christmas in 1984 he had created the first ripple of a gathering storm which eventually engulfed the nation. And in Aberdeen, Billy McIntyre still makes the 10 minute journey to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary to tousle his daughter's hair. Anything to keep her happy until she dies from a disease that started in cattle and is now eating her brain. </p> <p><b>The key unanswered questions</b></p> <p><b>Why does vCJD predominantly affect young people?</b> </p> <p>A possible explanation is the disproportionate consumption by young people of beefburgers, some of which contain high-risk material. There is also a higher incidence of affections such as tonsilitis or gastroenteritis in children giving rise to transmission through broken skin or mucous membranes; and transmission via childhood vaccines prepared in cultures containing bovine constituents. </p> <p><b>How many more people will succumb to vCJD?</b> </p> <p>Estimates of the size of an epidemic are made difficult by the many unknowns. Scientists do not know enough about dose, route of exposure, incubation period, genetic susceptibility and scale of the species barrier between cattle and humans. Latest estimates range from a few hundred to just over 130,000. </p> <p><b>What was the origin of BSE?</b> </p> <p>Lord Phillips believe we may never know for certain how and why BSE first appeared. The best guess is that a sporadic form of the disease probably occurred in the 1970s through some type of freak genetic dysfunction. The epidemic happened because remains of individual diseased cattle were ground up and fed back to healthy animals. </p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><br><a href=\"http://www.bse.org.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">BSE Inquiry</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.bsereview.org.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">Food Standards Agency BSE Review</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.maff.gov.uk/animalh/bse\" target=\"_NEW\">MAFF BSE site</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.doh.gov.uk/cjd\" target=\"_NEW\">Department of Health BSE/CJD site</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.humanbse.org.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">Human BSE Foundation - voluntary support group</a><br> <a href=\"http://sparc.airtime.co.uk/bse\" target=\"_NEW\">BSE news and research</a></p>",
  "On Thursday night, I was having a drink with Euan Blair. Since you're wondering, I was on the red wine; Euan sunk lemonades. He struck me as intelligent, poised - certainly much less gauche than I remember being at 16 - and charmingly undefensive, especially given that he was in conversation with the author of a book that has caused his father some recent embarrassment and the editor of Private Eye . Euan laughed at his own expense: 'I'm the family drunk.' <p>Only when we repaired to the bar did Ian Hislop, I or even his auntie Lauren become aware that Euan had been in the audience for a recording of Have I Got News For You , during which the Prime Minister's eldest son came in for some gentle ribbing and rather more scathing observations were tossed in the direction of his father. We were most savage about Tony Blair's latest colour change to green. </p> <p>Dad's big speech on the environment earlier in the week also featured a guest appearance by Euan, though this was less of a surprise. It is ever the Prime Minister's habit to deploy his children as a token of his sincerity about saving the world. He suggested that it was his son who opened his eyes to the importance of the environment when Euan butted into a discussion with a colleague and sat up debating with them 'into the late hours'. The Prime Minister expresses himself 'stunned' by how 'interested and knowledgeable' his son's generation are about the threat to the planet. This may tell us less about the young's grasp of the issues as Blair senior's lack of it. </p> <p>The environment has previously not much gripped the Prime Minister's imagination. His Government's record is not actually all that bad and, in some respects, it is quite good. Britain is meeting its international commitments to arrest global warming. But the environment has always been treated as an afterthought in the highest counsels of New Labour. Greenery was never regarded as integral to The Project. 'It is time to reawaken the environmental challenge,' says Mr Blair. That is, at least in part, because his Government has been content to let us slumber as the world chokes on the fumes of humanity. </p> <p>The cynic in us will say that Tony Blair has finally realised that there might, after all, be votes in the environment, especially among the younger section of the electorate who are switched off by grey politics. Just as there is a rising demand for more wholesome foods, so the electoral attractiveness of being politically organic seems to be dawning on Number 10. </p> <p>I'd also like to think that the Prime Minister is genuinely waking up to the consequences for the planet if we carry on abusing it. He described the scale of the menace rather eloquently. The alarming changes to the atmosphere darken the future of millions of people around the world. 'Here in the UK we too face threats - the prospect of exotic diseases becoming commonplace, of increased levels of skin cancer, of floods in some years, droughts in others, of low-lying areas being swallowed by the sea.' </p> <p>In comparison with those thundering horsemen of the apocalypse, a bit of cash from the lottery to encourage kerbside recycling and more investment in off-shore wind turbines is bound to sound bathetic, if not pathetic. The establishment of a green quango under Jonathon Porritt will be just another Whitehall wind farm unless it makes radical suggestions which are turned into legislation. </p> <p>The fate of Richard Rogers's urban task force, which offered the Government a transformatory plan to curb emigration to the sprawling suburbs by recasting our cities, is not terribly encouraging. Rumour suggests that Lord Rogers's proposals are being recycled into a tepid White Paper. A knowing chuckle must greet the Prime Minister's pledge that Britain will cut its carbon- dioxide emissions by 60 per cent by 2050. Even Tony Blair does not expect to be resident at Number 10 when Euan is a pensioner. </p> <p>That dreamy, distant target will not be entirely worthless if it helps to re-focus the Government away from its near-term obsession with not offending anyone in favour of the long-term measures needed to save our environment. Tony Blair emitted a cri de coeur about how difficult it was to resolve the conflict between 'a politician's need to woo the electorate as well as to lead them'. If his discovery of the environment is more than a passing fad, it will not be enough just to talk about 'hard choices'. He will have to make some. </p> <p>The Government will have to face down the so-called rural lobby who should not be confused with being green simply because they tend to be concentrated in the prettier parts of the country. Those who work the most beautiful parts of our environment can be its greatest enemies. Farmers are the worst polluters of the coun tryside, tearing it up, treating it as a rubbish tip and poisoning their own living with pesticides. There are those who fear that organo-phosphates will be the next BSE. Civil servants and Ministers have been rightly flayed for their grotesque failure to prevent mad cow disease. Guilt must also be pronounced on the subsidy-addicted agribusinessmen who turned cows into cannibals and wrecked confidence in farming. </p> <p>The Prime Minister will have to be less enthralled by the men of science who keep telling him that public wariness of genetically modified foods is just superstition, rather than a perfectly rational scepticism about the consequences of meddling with nature. That will mean being more robust with very large multinationals. The Climate Change Levy, to deter industrial pollution, is already being diluted before it has been introduced. Since heavy users of energy such as steel and chemicals won themselves huge reliefs from this green tax, others are predictably clamouring for similar exemptions. They will have to be resisted. </p> <p>Hardest choice of all for this Government, it will have to be firm with the motorist, that metallic, multi-headed beast whom Number 10 so fears to offend. Cars represent a quarter of carbon-dioxide emissions, let alone all the other toxic gases they pump into our lungs. Taxes on cars work. They take people off the road. The imperatives of short-term politics mean that Gordon Brown's forthcoming mini-Budget will be expected to contain something to soothe the discontent about petrol prices without appearing to appease the blockaders who brought the country to the lip of anarchy. </p> <p>Skilfully addressed, there is the opportunity to be both environmentally friendly and clever politically. The Government can make cuts in road tax to favour smaller, less thirsty vehicles and take measures to encourage greener hauliers. </p> <p>The tax windfall from rising oil prices can be put to work improving Britain's chronically under-invested public transport, especially a rail network so Third World that it is now paralysed by post-Hatfield emergency repairs. What a Prime Minister with fresh pretensions to being green should not be contemplating for a moment is any cut in fuel duty. The Tories will roar; the tabloids will scream. So be it. The world was never going to be saved without angering someone. </p> <p>Euan appears to have some green leverage on his father; perhaps he will make a submission to that effect. It would not be fair to reveal the contents of a private conversation with the Prime Minister's son, but I think he will forgive me for sharing with you how, as it got late, Euan executed a graceful exit. He had to go. Otherwise, 'Mum will kill me.' </p> <p>Our children will feel murderous towards us if we carry on killing the planet.</p>",
  "<p>Steve Martin has a problem with 'hellos'. He doesn't quite know whether to gush or to play them for laughs. When Richard E. Grant, the English actor who is now one of Martin's closest friends, arrived in Hollywood to start working with him on the film LA Story, their first encounter got off to a stuttering start. </p> <p>'We are so thrilled you are able to do this movie,' said Martin, his face wreathed in the magnanimous smiles of the superstar. </p> <p>'Believe me, the thrill's all mine,' matched Grant. </p> <p>Then, as a long afternoon of exchanging sugary pleasantries stretched out before them, Martin suddenly switched tactics and went into a comic 'bit' that Grant has come to know as his 'all-purpose Showbiz Schlockmeister routine' and which involves showering the visitor with an intentionally ludicrous stream of stock insincerities. </p> <p>His pose as a gracious and civil host had lasted less than 30 seconds. This turns out, however, to be longer than many strangers get. Even the printed cards that Martin once handed out to autograph hunters did not take the idea of celebrity very seriously. They read: 'This certifies that you have had a personal encounter with me and that you found me warm, polite, intelligent and funny.' </p> <p>Over the 24 years since the comedian began to establish himself as a star on the hit television show Saturday Night Live, interviewers have often noted how difficult Martin finds it to present himself 'in person'. </p> <p>'He wants to be nice. But it is as if he is determined that you shouldn't have the chance to make any harsh judgments, so he goes into a comic persona,' said one New York film writer who spent a day with him last year. </p> <p>Whether this standard performance is a sign of shyness or control-freakery is anyone's guess, but certainly this month the 55-year-old is asking the world to look at him afresh. His first novella, a poignant romance called Shopgirl, has just been published and the star has taken the opportunity to tell the world that he wants to leave both the stage and the film lot behind him forever. </p> <p>'I've made two decisions in my life,' he said. 'One was to leave stand-up and go into movies. The other is to write. Now is my time to write.' </p> <p>Although Bowfinger, Martin's 1999 movie attacking the film industry, was critically well-received, he now intends to turn down the kind of parts that have recently earned him around $6 million a throw. A string of earlier flops, such as Mixed Nuts and Leap of Faith, have had an impact. 'It just wasn't fun anymore,' Martin explained. </p> <p>This spring he made his first concerted move away from film and back into television. He and his business partner, Joan Stein, have signed a seven figure deal with the Carsey-Werner studio, the makers of Third Rock From the Sun, Cybill and Roseanne. They plan to write and produce a weekly show. </p> <p>To underline the change in gear, Martin told fans who attended a New York book reading last month that he had hated his time as a famous comic. </p> <p>'I know it sounds clich\u00e9d, but it was the most miserable time in my life. I couldn't leave my hotel room, I couldn't go outside. I was isolated, and isolation is where creativity ends.' </p> <p>But then again, Martin was talking to an audience at the time. And he was wearing luminous green socks underneath his sober, literary suit. </p> <p>So are we witnessing the 'tears of a clown' syndrome once again? Is this another cult comic hero who obsesses about the lightweight nature of his talents? </p> <p>Martin, by now an acknowledged comedian, screenwriter, playwright, author and musician, is regularly likened to Woody Allen. And it is true they have both grown away from pure gags. But there are some big distinctions too. </p> <p>Allen's innate intellectual confidence means he has never strained to take on any of his new guises. What's more, while both Allen and Martin's early work - in films such as Sleeper and The Man with Two Brains, respectively - was funny because it was truly silly, Martin initially had much the blacker tone. It is Allen, then, who has pushed himself towards heavier dramatic forms and Martin who has leavened his career by taking the primrose path into the Hollywood mainstream. </p> <p>His 130-page novella marks a turning point. It tells the story of Mirabelle, 'a beautiful wallflower' in her early thirties who is looking for love as she sells gloves in the Beverly Hills store, Neimans. In what is surely a whisper of authorial wish-fulfilment, she one day meets a millionaire in his fifties and a bitter-sweet flirtation begins. </p> <p>Martin has said the experience of having his heart broken and of breaking other people's hearts has prompted the story. It is a much more deliberately sensitive piece of writing than seen in his best-selling collection of stories and sketches, Pure Drivel. </p> <p>In 1993 Martin broke up with his English wife, Victoria Tennant, with whom he had starred in LA Story. He then went on to a high profile relationship with the film actress Anne Heche, who eventually left him for the lesbian sitcom star, Ellen DeGeneres. </p> <p>Most recently the comic's name has been briefly linked with that of another English woman, Helena Bonham Carter, who will appear with him this autumn in a comic thriller called Novocaine. So far, the actor has no children, explaining that he is 'too selfish' and 'moves around too much'. </p> <p>Martin, the original whacko from Waco, grew up in Texas and later California with his sister, Melinda, in the care of upright, religious parents. He broke away from such church-going strictures when he started selling guidebooks in Disneyland and learned to play the banjo. </p> <p>A proper job in showbusiness came with the role of television writer for Dick Van Dyke and The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, but real fame arrived in 1976 when Martin hosted his first Saturday Night Live. Easily distinguished by the rabbit ears and the arrow he wore on his head, Martin has always had a taste for simple vaudeville. One of his many stage acts, The Great Flydini, consisted of pulling a series of outr\u00e9 objects - for instance, eggs - from his unzipped fly. </p> <p>Unlikely though it may sound, international stardom followed quickly in 1979 with his film The Jerk and from then on Martin, much like Jerry Lewis before him, was to be strongly identified with the pratfall and the funny walk. </p> <p>His heroes, he says, were Jackie Gleason and Charlie Chaplin and, revealingly, it is their 'elegance' he singles out for praise. Martin's skill, far from a nerdy lack of physical control, is to see the discipline and grace required for this kind of comedy. Despite his frantic energy, friends and colleagues often sense a distance and a yearning for beauty and calm in Martin. </p> <p>Jonathan Lynn, the British film maker who directed him in Sgt Bilko in 1996, says he detected a certain remoteness in a man who was also, paradoxically, 'a national institution' in the United States. </p> <p>Martin's own sister has spoken publically too of his 'distance'. The siblings see each other infrequently and her brother, she has said, kept his links with the family to a minimum. </p> <p>In 1993 Martin made his debut as a playwright with Picasso at the Lapin Agile, a comic fantasy which went on to have a successful off-Broadway run. He has also appeared on the 'legit' stage in Samuel Beckett's bleak psychodrama, Waiting for Godot, at New York's Lincoln Centre. Nowadays, he is reported to spend a lot of time extending his valuable fine art collection. </p> <p>If Martin really does retreat from his fans and opt instead to create from behind the scenes as a writer or producer, perhaps the art of stand-up comedy should not feel too neglected. Tastes have moved on, and Martin's comparative restraint might not please the crowds any longer. </p> <p>After all, even The Great Flydini would look tame today when West End audiences are rolling in the aisles to the sight of live gonad manipulation in the Puppetry of the Penis.</p>",
  "The accented English of fluent foreigners such as Latino singer Ricky Martin or actress Juliette Binoche is usurping British and American English as the dominant form of the language. <p>This week the Government will announce that the number of people with English as a second language has overtaken the number who speak it as their native tongue. </p> <p>According to the figures, by the end of the year as many as 750 million people will speak English well enough to use it for business, and as many as a billion people are thought to be learning English at any given time. </p> <p>The British Council statistics have been seized on by Education and Employment Secretary David Blunkett, who will tell a meeting of business leaders on Tuesday to capitalise on their advantage as native speakers. </p> <p>English-language books, films and TV shows are worth nearly \u00a35 billion to the British economy, with education materials alone worth \u00a31.2bn. But the rush to share Shakespeare's tongue may see British schoolchildren lose the motivation to learn foreign languages. </p> <p>Insiders say the drive to make English the global lingua franca comes directly from Tony Blair. The so-called 'Blair Initiative' was launched in 1998 after the Prime Minister was told off by the Mayor of Shanghai, Xu Kuangdi, for failing to promote English abroad. On his return, Blair ordered the British Council to remedy the situation and allocated \u00a35 million for English-language initiatives. The anglophile Xu, who lived as a student in London in the Eighties, said the French, Germans and Americans were far better at promoting their culture. They may also soon be far better at speaking English.</p>",
  "Dogs are given more leg room on planes than humans. Strict guidelines on canines travelling in the cargo hold mean they must be able to turn round in comfort - unlike their human masters in economy class. <p>It means that dogs have to be held in containers twice their width, enabling them to stretch, turn round and ensure their circulation does not suffer. By contrast, the minimum amount of space required for humans is 26in between the back of the seat cushion and the seat in front - and that is before the person ahead reclines the seat. </p> <p>Tristan Bradfield, assistant manager at the Animal Reception Centre at Heathrow, who deals with the containers on a daily basis, said: 'There is more room in a minimum requirement box than in an economy-class seat. For dogs to turn round, the box must be twice the width of the animal. It's like having double-width seats.' </p> <p>Horses also have an advantage over humans in waiting time. Horses are not supposed to be on board an aircraft for more than 30 minutes before take-off, and for 30 minutes after landing. </p> <p>Passenger comfort and well-being are not at present regulated by the Civil Aviation Authority, which only requires 26in between the back cushion of a seat and the seat in front. Most airlines have between 28in and 32in. </p> <p>Bryn Aldridge, director of trading standards at the Corporation of London, who runs the centre at Heathrow, said dogs are proportionally better off than economy-class passengers. 'There are rules set down for animal transport, but there are none for human beings,' he said. </p> <p>'We are solely concerned with ensuring that people can be evacuated from air craft in the case of an emergency,' said a Civil Aviation Authority spokesman. 'We don't have any expertise or evidence with which to comment on these findings.' </p> <p>The revelations come at the end of a week in which economy-class travel has been embroiled in controversy. Critics claim that the cramped conditions of airline seats can cause health problems, such as clots in the bloodstream. </p> <p>A healthy 28-year-old Briton, Emma Christoffersen, died earlier this month from deep vein thrombosis or DVT, a blood clot that starts in the legs and works its way to the heart or lungs with often fatal causes. Since the uproar after her death, doctors have dismissed the link between economy travel seats and DVT. British Airways says that, although long periods of immobility can contribute to DVT, it is not specific to the cabin environment.</p> <p>Bob Tolliday spokesman for the Consumers' Association said: 'It's about time that comfort was considered, particularly in long-haul flights as there may be a health effect, but it has not, until now, been considered important.' </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:nick.walsh@observer.co.uk\">nick.walsh@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "Government plans to burn household waste in incinerators rather than recycle it will produce so much toxic pollution it will cause almost 9,000 deaths. <p>The Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions is committed to building more than 70 incinerators, which its own estimates suggest will cause at least 350 deaths a year for the next 25 years. </p> <p>There are now only 15 solid waste incinerators in the UK, but the Government will increase that to 87 in a bid to reduce the amount of rubbish that has to be buried as landfill sites are used up. The building programme is being subsidised with more than \u00a3200 million of public money, and has provoked dozens of local campaigns. </p> <p>The incinerators - burning plastics, metal cans, food and packaging at very high temperatures - pump out a cocktail of hundreds of toxic substances. They emit fine particles of heavy metals, including cadmium, which causes lung and kidney disease, and mercury, which attacks the nervous system. </p> <p>Dust particles from the burnt rubbish exacerbate asthma, chronic bronchitis and heart disease. The burning of plastics produces dioxins, some of the most toxic chemicals known. An American study to be published shortly will show that 7 per cent of cancers are associated with dioxins - around 80 per cent of which come from incinerators. </p> <p>Research earlier this year suggested that, between 1974 and 1987, children who lived within three miles of an incinerator were twice as likely as others to die of cancer. </p> <p>However, a DETR spokesman said the Government's independent scientific advisers had found 'no convincing evidence of a link'. 'The older generation of incinerators have already been replaced with new, cleaner technology,' he added. </p> <p>However, the new incinerators - spread throughout the country - will produce 17,000 tonnes of nitrous oxides each year. A recent DETR report predicted that 50 tonnes of nitrous oxides would on average lead to one death. </p> <p>In total, according to the Government's own figures, the new incinerators would lead to 349 deaths a year. The plants have a working life of 25 years, bringing the total of lives lost to 8,700. Deaths from other pollutants would push the total higher. </p> <p>Rob Gueterbock, waste campaigner at Greenpeace, who analysed the figures, said: 'Government incineration policy is using taxpayers' money to bring thousands to an early death. Instead of expanding incineration, these cancer factories should be shut down.' </p> <p>As most countries move away from incineration because of its dangers and concentrate on recycling, Britain has the lowest re-cycling rate in Europe. This country reuses only 9 per cent of its waste.</p> <p>New techniques clean the worst poisons from the gas, but they remain in the toxic ash, which must be buried. </p> <p>Vyvyan Howard, a toxico-pathologist at Liverpool University, said: 'You don't get rid of the rubbish, you just change its nature and disperse a lot of it to the wind. It's a dangerous process.'</p>",
  "<p>Each night in Monte Carlo, it is said, a recording of predatory birds is transmitted through hidden loudspeakers in the main square to prevent sparrows from soiling the famous casino's pristine lawn. And each morning a platoon of gardeners removes dying petals from the immaculate flowerbeds. Amid such stainless perfection, a prison could look embarrassingly conspicuous. The authorities in the world's wealthiest state have dealt with the problem by locating the local jail on the very extremity of its tiny landmass. Of the thousands of tour- ists who file past the old fort on the rocky promontory of Monaco Ville, between the Oceanographic Museum and a cheesy celebration of the Grimaldi family called the Monte Carlo Story, very few realise that incarcerated within its walls are the principality's 20 or so prisoners. There are no signboards nor, indeed, any apparent entrance. The only clues to its true purpose are the bars on the windows and the battery of security cameras on the roof - hardly an atypical sight in Monaco. </p> <p>Among the inmates, most of whom are imprisoned for fraud or other white-collar crime, is Ted Maher, a 42-year-old former Green Beret in the US Army. Last December, Maher was arrested following the deaths of billionaire banker Edmond Safra and his nurse in circumstances that remain oblique and subject to a multitude of speculative theories. Initially, Maher was not a suspect. Those who were, suggested one newspaper, 'range from the Russian mafia to Japanese investors, through drug cartels and Middle Eastern trading companies'. It seemed that Safra, 67, who was renowned for his protective shield of Israeli bodyguards, was a man with no shortage of enemies. And, equally, Maher, a smalltown American who never travelled beyond US borders in his three years in the army, appeared to be someone who was a total stranger to both drug cartels and the Moscow mafia. </p> <p>How he came to be in Monaco was a result of unforeseeable happenstance. Working at the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York, where he had qualified as a licensed nurse, Maher found an expensive camera which he promptly returned to its owner. The photographer mentioned the story to an associate, Safra, who was sufficiently impressed to offer Maher a position as part of his 12-strong medical team - the banker suffered from Parkinson's Disease. </p> <p>The unworldly Maher spoke not a word of French. Safra, a Lebanese Jew with Brazilian nationality who lived mostly in the south of France, was fluent in French, English, Italian, Portuguese, Arabic and Hebrew. Maher was a tall, slender man with an open manner. Safra was short and bald and enigmatic. Maher had an ongoing property dispute with his next-door neighbour in upper New York State. Safra owned a vast penthouse in Monaco and La Leopolda, the magnificent villa in Villefranche built on the estate that once belonged to Belgium's genocidal King Leopold II. He also possessed homes in Paris, Geneva, London, New York and Brazil. </p> <p>In any other circumstances, the closest Maher might have come to Safra would have been to cash a cheque in one of his banks. But, as it was, Maher left his wife and three children in Stormville, New York, and his secure post at Columbia-Presbyterian, and flew to the French Riviera and a $600-a-day ringside view of the life of one of the world's richest and most mysterious men. </p> <p> As far back as 1957, Edmond Safra was named as a drug trafficker in a US Bureau of Narcotics report. The accusation was later withdrawn, but until his death Safra was the inspiration for countless unsubstantiated rumours that linked him to drug, gold and currency trafficking, money laundering and organised crime. </p> <p>The Safra family came from the Halabi merchants of northern Lebanon, a close-knit clan of Sephardic Jewish traders who historically made their money from financing the camel caravans of the Middle East. Edmond's father Jacob opened the family bank in 1920, building on the Safras' long experience in gold and currency exchange. Sephardic tradition maintained that the family business should be passed on to the oldest son. But such was his precocious interest in banking that the young Edmond leapfrogged his elder brother, Elie, to be selected by his father as the prime heir. At just 16, Edmond went to Milan to learn the banking business and then on to Brazil, where he set up his first bank at the age of 21. </p> <p>In contrast to most banks, Safra's was built on deposits rather than loans. It may be this strategy that originally led some observers to view Safra's banks as attractive propositions for money launderers. Five years ago, New York magazine ran an investigation into Safra's Republic National Bank in which it claimed that the bank 'quickly became known on the street as a bank that would send an armoured car to pick up large sums from its more secretive customers'. </p> <p>In the 80s, Safra and Republic were the targets of a global whispering campaign. Among the allegations that surfaced in a variety of mostly obscure publications was the suggestion that he was involved in the Iran-Contra affair; that he arranged the murder of a security specialist who had supposedly discovered a link between him and the arms-for-hostages scandal; that he had double-crossed the Medellin cocaine cartel; that he was a confr\u00e8re of mafia legend Mayer Lansky; and that Republic had laundered the drug-trafficking profits of Panama's General Noriega. </p> <p>Only the last claim had any basis in established fact, and Republic was only one of a number of banks that held Noriega's funds. Eventually, Safra proved in court that the rumours emanated from his corporate rivals, American Express, which had bought Republic's Swiss parent company, TDB, in an acrimonious deal in 1983 (Safra regained control in 1988). American Express was forced to apologise and donate $8m to a number of charities, including the Anti-Defamation League. For many people in and around the world of banking, however, Safra's legal victory served only to increase their suspicions of the secretive Lebanese businessman. In New York and London it was customary to grin in a knowing fashion whenever Safra's name was mentioned. Now the grins were that much wider. </p> <p>Bryan Burrough ascribed the slurs aimed at Safra to anti-Semitism in his book Vendetta: American Express and the Smearing of Edmond Safra . But if anti-Semitism alone was the reason for the stories, then why was Safra singled out and not the innumerable other Jewish bankers operating in high finance? It would be rather as if Michael Jordan had been selected for racist abuse on account of being a black player in basketball. Whatever the true explanation for the attacks, Safra was acutely sensitive to their effect on his good name. He was determined to sue any publication, however small, that repeated the libels. </p> <p>While American Express was waging its smear campaign, American customs officers were investigating Safra's banks for laundering Colombian drug funds. No charges were brought. Yet when the news emerged that Safra was dead, the prime suspects were not embittered former American Express executives or Colombian drug lords, but the Russian mafia, or mafiya . </p> <p>Three factors pointed in its direction. First, Republic's dealings with Russia were well documented. Under licence from the US government, Republic shipped around $10bn of US currency a year to Russian banks. Although perfectly legal, the shipments caused no little consternation among some state agencies. The problem was that many banks in Russia, and up to 50 that Republic was trading currency with, were suspected of being at the very least unreliable and quite possibly fronts for the mafiya. Referring to this apparent criminalisation of cash, a source from the Criminal Investi gation Bureau of New York State Banking Department told New York magazine: 'To us it was like a sore on Cindy Crawford's face.' </p> <p>Second, at the time of his death, Safra was engaged in the protracted and problematic sale of Republic to HSBC. There were various hold-ups, but one of them was said to be the Russian accounts that were frozen as a result of Federal investigation into money laundering, which Republic itself prompted by alerting the authorities to its concerns. Observers speedily concluded that a short-changed mafiya chief had sought revenge. Some 90 or so bankers have been killed in Russia since the collapse of the Soviet Union. 'What you have to understand,' Stephen Handelman, an expert on the mafiya and author of Comrade Criminal , told me, 'is that bankers are different in Russia. Over 2,000 banks were set up after 1989, most of which have since collapsed, and many of the people behind them had emerged from the black market and criminal backgrounds. So often when a banker is killed he may himself be involved in the mafiya.' </p> <p>And third, the French Riviera, which enjoys a rich history of Russian influence dating back to 19th-century aristocrats, had seen a sudden and ostentatious influx of newly wealthy Russians. Tales of Moscow businessmen buying yachts and property for cash formed the gossip of sales people from Cannes up to Menton, who, while often offended, seldom refused the money. In Nice, the mafiya was said to have bought into the exclusive Marina Baie des Anges, where the head of one Russian crime gang was arrested with false papers and fled to Monaco. In the past three years, Monaco has itself expelled 15 Russians suspected of illegal business practices, including a former KGB colonel. And some lawyers say that Monaco has now adopted an unofficial policy of refusing entry to all Russians. </p> <p>Arnaud Montauibourg, a French MP who led a parliamentary investigation into the mafiya, thinks the mafiya has already 'penetrated Monaco', laundering money 'through real estate, the casino and through trusts'. Sitting outside the Caf\u00e9 de Paris in Monte Carlo on a soft autumn evening earlier this month, watching the hopefuls making their way to the casino, it was not hard to spot the Russian businessmen. They have little apparent fear of cultural stereotyping. Thus two men with gold bracelets and neck chains sat drinking vodka and smoking weighty cigars, largely ignoring their two women companions whose compliant demeanour, polite laughter and visible stocking garters made it plain that they were part of the night's entertainment bill. </p> <p>It's this kind of egregious behaviour that has placed the Russians, whether legitimate business people or not, at the centre of a near moral panic hereabouts. The Russians are coming, is the anxious chorus on the Cte d'Azur, and everyone assumed they had come for Safra. </p> <p> At 5am on the morning of 3 December last </p> <p> year, Ted Maher awoke his boss with news that two masked men had broken into the belle \u00e9poque building at 17 Avenue D'Ostende in Monaco. Maher was bleeding from three stab wounds. Although a former Green Beret, Maher had served as a medical auxiliary. He had no more experience of combat than he did of high-style living. He was there to tend his employer, not protect him. For that, Safra had his Israeli army bodyguards. But not in Monaco. So safe did he feel in his penthouse next to the renowned Hotel Hermitage, that he maintained the security team at La Leopolda, 10 miles away. </p> <p>It was there during the 80s that Safra, under the guidance of his Brazilian socialite wife, held celebrity-enriched parties of daunting splendour. Lily, whom Safra married in 1976, had three children from a previous marriage and was independently a very rich woman. Nevertheless, the prenuptial agreement she signed was said to have run to 600 pages. It was she who ensured that names such as Aristotle Onassis and Frank Sinatra were included on the Safras' guest list. John Fairchild, the arbiter of American high-society standing, was moved to speak of the couple's 'meteoric rise to social power'. </p> <p>But social acceptance had not lessened Safra's near-phobic paranoia. He always carried blue gemstones to ward off the evil eye, and retained an abiding fear of curses. He was deeply superstitious about the number five and was terrified of being kidnapped. So he must have been deeply scared early that morning when he learned from Maher that the state-of-the-art security system in the building, which also housed three banks, had been breached. Immediately, Safra retreated with another of his nurses, 52-year-old Viviane Torrente, to his steel-reinforced bathroom. </p> <p>Within minutes a fire broke out. This is how Monaco's assistant prosecutor Catherine Le Lay described the scene: 'The apartment is immense, and within it there are two separate wings, one for Mr Safra and one for his wife. Mr Safra was in his wing, which consisted of three rooms - his bedroom, a nursing laboratory and a bathroom. With him were two nurses. The police received a call from the receptionist of the building. She had been alerted by the male nurse, who had staggered from the apartment which occupies the fifth and sixth floors, down to the ground floor. He had been injured with a knife with a six-inch blade. </p> <p>'The police arrived at the scene extremely quickly and when they arrived they were un able immediately to access the apartment, which is protected by steel-reinforced doors. When they did gain entry with the firemen, the fire had already taken hold in the flat, which was extremely difficult to bring under control. When the police were finally able to penetrate the flat, they found Mr Safra dead where he had taken refuge in the bathroom with his nurse, Viviane Torrente, who also died. </p> <p>'His wife was not even roused by the drama. It is difficult to convey just how big this flat is, but I have never seen anything like it. She was separated by a good distance from her husband and each door was reinforced. By the time the firemen had mastered the fire, smoke was only beginning to affect her wing of the flat, which would have rendered her more deeply unconscious. We still don't know how the attackers got into the flat, or how they escaped.' </p> <p>Safra and Torrente died from smoke inhalation. The fumes reached them through the fire-detection system. With its 500 officers, Monaco is probably the most intensively policed square mile anywhere on the planet - the local constabulary likes to boast that it can close down all exit routes from the principality in minutes. Its border with France is only notional, but the police always man it. Its streets and buildings are also the world's most intensively filmed. </p> <p>Very few square feet remain unrecorded by the ubiquitous security cameras. But there was no sign of the intruders. The idea that two men could break into the heavily secured home of one of the world's wealthiest men, cause his death and leave without trace did not sit well with Monaco's reputation as a crime-free zone for the super-rich. </p> <p>The police became convinced that it was an inside job. Within two days of Safra's death, Maher was arrested. And, shortly afterwards, he told police that he had stabbed himself and started a fire and that there were no intruders, masked or otherwise. His actions, he said, were an attempt to gain his boss's respect. He spoke of not getting along with the head nurse, a woman named Sonia, and how he wished to circumvent her power by demonstrating his loyalty to Safra. At a news conference, chief prosecutor Daniel Serdet quoted from Maher's police statement: 'It was my own dark ideas which led me to do this.' </p> <p>This was an extraordinary turnaround. From a story of high-financial corruption and international gangsterism, it became one of a misguided approach to job promotion. Police announced Maher's confession on 6 December, the same day that Safra was buried in Geneva. Around 1,000 mourners attended the ceremony at the Hekhal Haness synagogue, including the Nobel Peace laureate Eli Wiesel, Israel's foreign minister David Levy, Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan and former United Nations secretary general, Javier P\u00e9rez de Cu\u00e9llar. Also, on the same day, the US Federal Reserve approved the sale of Republic to HSBC Holdings, and four weeks to the day after Safra's death the $9.85bn deal was completed, netting Safra's heirs some $2.8bn. Could it really be that strange and that straightforward? </p> <p> In America, the conspiracy theorists' medium, the internet, has been hot with indignation. There is much talk of Maher's 'imprisonment as a scapegoat for Russian money- launderers' and he is referred to as 'prisoner of war'. 'Please help him,' runs one appeal, 'before he is killed by the Monaco government or the responsible parties that did commit this crime and used Ted as a scapegoat.' Much of the stuff is hysterically xenophobic, virulently right-wing and clearly the work of delusional minds. Of course, that doesn't mean that Maher isn't a fall guy. However, his defence team certainly do not see Maher as the victim of a fiendish plot. </p> <p>Georges Blot, Maher's Monegasque lawyer, has gone on record as saying that his client started the fire and stabbed himself. 'The first words Ted said to me when I met him were: \"This is horrible. I loved him. I admired him. I respected him. I don't understand why I did it.\"' </p> <p>Maher's family in the US are unimpressed. They say that the internal security videotapes, which they believe would prove Maher's innocence, have gone missing (Monaco police say the video system was not working). And Maher's wife Heidi, argues that her husband's legal defence is compromised because it is state-appointed. 'The Monaco government is paying Ted's lawyer, Mr Blot, which is clearly a conflict of interest,' she has said. In fact, that is common legal practice, and indeed a human right, in most countries on occasions when the accused cannot afford a lawyer. Yet while Monaco is not implicated in a cover-up, there is a sense that it is actively presenting an untroubled face to the world. </p> <p>This is not the first time that a banker's death has caused a scandal in the region. Back in 1990, Jean Ferry, an official of the Industrial Bank of Monaco (BIM), was found dead from a bullet wound in the head. The police decided it was suicide, but a subsequent investigation found that a client of Ferry had constructed a large-scale fraud involving BIM. It also discovered that lax practices encouraging foreign tax evasion were endemic within the Monaco banking system. The most common method exploited a law which enabled foreign investors to create 'shell' companies in the names of Monegasque citizens (for a small payment). It has often been alleged that the system is abused by organised crime. </p> <p>Roger Bianchini, a journalist with Nice-Matin , told an author of a book on the Grimaldis: 'The whole system is well known to the initiated. But when underground deals begin to surface and scandal breaks through, Prince Rainier becomes concerned that the image of the principality could be tarnished.' </p> <p>As with other wealthy climes, such as Beverly Hills, the very sheen of Monaco's surface leads the visitor to suspect some form of moral corruption lurking underneath. The old wedding-cake architecture that survives is placed in the shade by the huge apartment-block developments that Rainier green-lighted in the 60s, creating an odd combination of sickly innocence and brash confidence. Although there is a refreshing sea breeze and the streets are neurotically clean, the faintest smell of pollution hangs in the air alongside the sweet fragrance of jasmine. And there is a disturbing sense that no amount of money will wash it away. </p> <p>For all its publicity-seeking glamour, Monaco thrives on secrecy. The government and its institutions, such as the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Bains de Mer, which runs the casino and hotels and much else, and which are all essentially arms of the Grimaldi empire ruled by Prince Rainier, are unapologetically opaque. Bankers may be attracted to secrecy, but so are storytellers. One of the more fanciful ideas doing the rounds has it that the Grimaldi grip on Monaco includes extensive telephone tapping based on a word-trigger system. 'If you said something derogatory about a Grimaldi it would undoubtedly hit the trigger,' suggests one observer. </p> <p>Against this backdrop of fantasy, any explanation of events provided by Monaco, the so-called Disneyland Dictatorship, would never be seen as the whole story. And indeed there are inconsistencies. Even Safra's widow's lawyer, Marc Bonnant, was concerned to ask that all the evidence be made available. </p> <p>'We would like to have all the details of the nurse's confession. Was it credible and complete, what exactly pushed him to do what he did, how many fires did he set, are there any inconsistencies in his confession? A thousand questions come to mind which need answers to make any sense out of this tragic and absurd death.' </p> <p>Among those questions, perhaps, are why did Safra remain in the bathroom even after the police arrived and why did it take two long hours for the fire brigade to get inside the bathroom? And why is it that Maher is said to have started only one fire and yet investigators located two separate origins? </p> <p>In early official reports it was stated - unambiguously by assistant prosecutor Le Lay - that Lily Safra did not speak to her husband during his confinement in the bathroom, that she was asleep. Elsewhere there were reports that she had spoken to him on a mobile phone. Bonnant told me, 'Edward Safra spoke twice to his wife, to his bodyguard and to the police.' Then why did he not emerge from the bathroom? Bonnant says that everyone was still under the impression that two armed intruders were in the building, which is also why the fire brigade made slow progress. </p> <p>But given the police presence and his own security guard, Safra must have been paralysed with fear not to feel confident enough to come out. Who did he think was after him? Bonnant is quick to scotch any talk of assassins. 'Look, if you want to kill a man, you pay $20,000 and you get the job done the right way by a professional. The right way is not to hire a nurse to start a small fire and hope that the police take two hours to get to him.' An insider on Maher's defence team echoes this point. 'People have told me they know for sure that Safra was shot with two bullets. Now the defence is going to see the inside of the building and we've asked for further fire reports and to look at video film outside the home. It might be that we'll see two guys in balaclavas on top of the roof, but I don't think so. And you have to ask, why were there no holes in Ted's clothes where his wounds were? Did the intruders thoughtfully lift up his shirt before stabbing him?' </p> <p>Handelman also dismissed the idea that Russians were behind Safra's death. 'It just wasn't their MO. Not outside Russia. Most people thought Safra was holding IOUs or money for the mafiya, but they wouldn't have killed him for that.' But he added: 'You can always be surprised.' </p> <p> After Maher's confession was made public, people began to ask how Safra had ever come to employ a man with such evident psychological problems. Suddenly it was common knowledge that Maher had a prescription-drug problem - according to Serdet - a history of violence and unstable personality traits. His colleagues at Columbia-Presbyterian countered these stories and provided an image of a reliable and motivated worker. 'He was really on top of things,' said one paediatrician. 'In fact, he was one of the better nurses I've seen.' </p> <p>Bonnant has said that Maher was properly vetted through 'in-depth background checks', as well as being interviewed by Safra himself. 'The fact that Maher is unstable became apparent to us only after the accident. Nothing in Maher's files showed the slightest trace of mental instability.' Perhaps because it wasn't there. </p> <p>Some newspaper articles quoted a former neighbour who quarrelled with Maher. 'He was a miserable bastard,' said 70-year- old Leonard Levelle, who accused Maher of physical assault. According to Maher's defence, Levelle himself was cautioned a number of times by the police. Much was also made of Mayer's leaving the Las Vegas police force after only three months. His defence say he quit because he contracted spinal meningitis. </p> <p>So was it a bizarre aberration? 'The reality of the situation is not something Ted can articulate,' say his defence. But the same source believed Maher was under pressure because his wife wanted him to return home and he wanted to stay in Monaco. </p> <p>What even his detractors agree on is that Maher never intended to kill Safra. 'If he wanted to,' said Serdet, 'he would have had 10,000 chances a day.' The fire simply got out of hand because he started it in an acrylic wastepaper basket. However, Maher is currently charged on a count of arson leading to death, a crime which carries a maximum life sentence. </p> <p>In his Monte Carlo office, high above the Boulevard des Moulins, Donald Manasse, an American-Frenchman who is assisting Georges Blot, told me, 'Ted is not guilty of the crimes as charged and we are seeking a requalification of the charges.' </p> <p>Optimistically, he might be looking at four to six years. But that's still a very severe sentence for what basically amounts to an accident. Bonnant demonstrated the Safra family's determination to gain what they see as justice. He told me: 'We want to ensure that the one who caused this will be properly punished.' </p> <p>The trial is unlikely to come to court until early next year. The investigating judge, Patricia Richett is still conducting her inquiry. Given the profile and importance of Safra, and the sensitivity of the Monaco authorities, fears have been expressed by those close to Maher that the investigation might be partial. Manasse was certain that Richett would not succumb to external pressure from any direction. 'Anyone who would say she could be influenced by third parties,' he told me, 'has no idea who she is.' </p> <p>Maher, it seems, does have one influential supporter himself. Dominic Dunne, the celebrated Vanity Fair writer and crusader against criminal injustice, is known to be sympathetic towards his plight. And the Monegasques have taken due notice. 'When Serdet heard that Dunne was arriving in Monaco,' a legal source said, 'he was practically saying, \"We've got to get this right, Dominic Dunne is coming to town.\"' </p> <p>In the meantime, Maher, the man who wanted to gain attention, is locked up in a prison that dare not speak its name, removed from his Mediterranean idyll, but tantalisingly trapped a few feet from the sea. He has no visitors, save his lawyers and the American consulate representative, and of course the tourists passing unknowingly by on their way to see a different Monte Carlo story. </p> <p>Life in Monaco continues as ever in its own secretive way. On a brilliant morning with seagulls circling overhead and the roar of the Monaco Kart Cup ripping around the bay, I stopped outside 17 Avenue D'Ostende. The fire damage is now mostly repaired, and just to be certain, I asked a policeman where Monsieur Safra had lived. He looked at me with a thin smile and said, ' Je ne sais pas.' Then he walked away. </p> <p>After Safra's burial, Eli Wiesel said of the close friend he often called his brother: 'After all, what remains of a man after his death? It is his name, his reputation, his honour.' And, a less circumspect man might have added, his money. Already there is talk of family disputes about where it will go. And there will continue to be talk about the banker from Beirut. For if Ted Maher started the fire, there was always smoke around Edmond Safra.</p>",
  "Given the choice, the public chose Sainsbury's. Offered its pick of every new building in the land, it turned its back on the austere reconstruction of Tate Modern, on the pomo funfairness of the London Eye and on the steel-and-glass clich\u00e9s of a hundred Lottery-funded arts centres. Instead, when - for the first time - we the people were asked to make our selection for the Stirling Prize, our most prestigious architecture competition, we plumped for Sainsbury's. <p>Not any old Sainsbury's, but the new one just down the road from the Dome and across the Thames from Norman Foster's Canary Wharf Tube station - which came second in the people's vote by just one vote. (For the record, I cast my vote for Southwark Tube station. The final victor will be announced next Saturday evening, when the great, the good and the dinner-jacketed will gather in front of the cameras of Channel 4 to announce - live! from the Wellcome Wing of the Science Museum! - the winner of this year's glittering prize.) </p> <p>It's an eco-friendly branch of 'the nation's favourite supermarket', with all clever kinds of stuff built into it - natural lighting balanced by computer-controlled louvres on top, wind-and-solar-powered totem signs out front and 75m-deep boreholes down below to run the cooling system. I tried it out, did a house shop there on a Thursday lunchtime - \u00a371.43 for 29 items, including half a dozen decent oysters (\u00a32.94), a double pack of apple and mango juice (\u00a33.49) and a Savoy cabbage (99p). On the way out, I splurged a ridiculous \u00a32.90 on a venti mocha frappuccino at the inhouse Starbucks. I was, in short, everyshopper for the afternoon. </p> <p>Designed by the previously obscure firm Chetwood Associates, it's a fine addition to Sainsbury's long association with proper architecture - Samantha Hardingham's guide to recent English architecture lists four branches, not including Nick Grimshaw's masterfully brutish one in Camden Town. The Greenwich store is already the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors building of the year. It's elegant, clever and good at the important bit of its job - making your shop easy, calm and joyful. </p> <p>Its low profile and grassed-over, sloping walls make it look not at all unpleasantly Teletubbyish. The 'steel-framed, 280m radius, barrel-vault roof with integrated radiating northlight double-glazed strips' both gives a clear, soft light and has a wry zoomorphism to it - suggesting the skeleton of some giant prehistoric sea thing which got beached on the Greenwich peninsula when the North Sea retreated back towards the dodgems and whelk stalls of Southend. But it's still just a supermarket. Frankly, I think the voting public is trying to tell architects something here. In choosing it, we've clearly indicated a set of values about our built environment. In the hierarchy of architecture, its practitioners put monumentalism at the top of their totem pole. We prefer a wind-and-solar-powered shop sign on top of ours, it seems. </p> <p>Architects - in cahoots with their natural allies, princes, politicians and panjandrums - like to build on a giant scale. As a profession, they tend to give awards to the big dick (and fanny, if you include Canary Wharf Tube) stuff - skyscrapers, galleries, museums, bridges, town halls, law courts. We're saying we want good architecture on a more domestic scale and that we care most about the stuff round the corner - possibly because even the most culture-vulturish of us spends more time shopping for dinner than we do looking at paintings. </p> <p>Some of our big-name architects have found their own way of connecting their work with us and our taste for shopping. As fashion designers make their money from scent and household knick-knacks, so our architectural lords are starting to do the same. You might not be able to afford to have Richard Rogers design your house, but you can have him do your door knobs. Though Chetwood Associates has yet to develop its diffusion range, Nick Grimshaw, creator of the Eurostar terminal and the forthcoming Earth Centre in Cornwall, offers architectural ironmongery - handles and the like - via Allgoods. Foster Associates has a range of 15 different products, including shelving, storage systems and an Alessi table. Will Alsop, architect of another Stirling finalist, the Peckham public library, sells his paintings - \u00a33,000 for River of Dreams: Glasgow , from the Mayo Gallery in London's Cork Street. </p> <p>Nigel Coates even has his own shop, a possibly fitting excess for an architect whose work is best described - in the words of the narration to Babe 2: Pig in the City - as standing 'a little to the left of the 20th century'. While most of his profession has adhered to the Mies van der Rohe axiom 'less is more', Coates has always favoured the 'more is still not enough' approach. Doric columns, bits of old airplanes, coloured glass - all have a treasured place in his buildings. His Clerkenwell shop has a similarly magpie approach, offering T-shirts with his name on, bits of jewellery, models of his work and The Coates David Collection - soft furnishings and tchochkes inspired by Michelangelo. The 15cm by 18cm Bollox Bowl in polished aluminium has to be my personal favourite. </p> <p>Coates' recent architecture has had mixed fortunes. There was the Dome's Bodyzone, and the pop music centre in Sheffield - now closed. His one unalloyed success has been the extension to the Geffrye Museum in Shoreditch. What's in it? A shop, of course.</p>",
  "<p>Had the Rev Dr Colin Morris remained merely a minister in the Methodist Church, he would now, at 70, be living on a modest pension. Instead, as a former television executive and a regular broadcaster, his retirement is a very comfortable one. </p> <p> But Morris's feelings about money are far less comfortable. What comes across in his broadcasts (often for BBC Radio 4's Thought for the Day ) is a sense of unease, even guilt. </p> <p> It started in his twenties when he went to Africa as a missionary. 'After being ordained at university, I was sent to the copper belt of Northern Rhodesia. I had a good house and car, in fact a standard of living much better than I'd enjoyed back in Britain - it was almost embarrassing,' he says. </p> <p> 'There's an unresolvable tension because, as a Christian minister, you follow someone who had nowhere to lay his head and yet you're one of the best off in the community.' </p> <p> Morris describes his early life as classic How Green Was My Valley - his father was a coal miner and trade union activist, unemployed for periods. Morris grew up as both a socialist and a non-conformist and the influences remain strong. 'I've got this nonconformist conviction that one should live within one's means,' he says, 'so I live in absolute horror of being overdrawn. But I know it's a very unsophisticated way of understanding money'. </p> <p> After returning from Africa in the Seventies, Morris spent several years in the Methodist ministry at Wesley's Chapel in London.</p> <p> But just as his financial fortunes improved when he became a missionary, so they changed again when he started to present the BBC's new religious programme Everyman. </p> <p> That led to the job of head of religious programmes and life as a TV executive. 'When I went from being a Methodist minister to head of religious TV, I began to wonder how I'd ever lived on one penny less than I was now earning. Money becomes an absolute necessity. I was dealing with enormous budgets, and it's amazing how quickly you get used to signing large cheques with a flourish. </p> <p> 'I had started off in the anti-capitalist mode, but later I realised capitalism wasn't going to go away. It would be hypocritical to condemn it utterly and draw a pension made by a capitalist system.'</p> <p> Instead Morris tried at least to be a humane capital ist - espousing ethical investment, the work of Jubilee 2000 in reducing Third World debt and making charitable donations. </p> <p> Morris feels very lucky to have his BBC pension. His tastes are hardly extravagant: a little flat by the sea, books and the F-reg, 3-series BMW he bought from the BBC when he retired. But being comfortable hasn't taken away the difficult questions. </p> <p> As a young missionary he admired the White Fathers, a Roman Catholic order that adopted the local population's way of life. He says: 'People like that have an unchallengeable authority as exemplars of the way of Jesus - not having possessions, and turning the other cheek. </p> <p> 'We know that to do it would throw society into chaos. But it's a crunch issue for people like me, because in the end theology isn't what you talk, it's what you do.'</p>",
  "<p>The Government is looking at ways of using the UK's cultural connections with India to strengthen links between hi-tech businesses. </p> <p>Patricia Hewitt, the e-commerce minister, flies to India today for a week-long tour of the country to encourage partnerships and investment in both countries. </p> <p>Hewitt said: 'In the past, the UK has not appreciated the benefit of our economic and cultural links with India. It is set to become one of the largest and most exciting knowledge-driven economies of the twenty-first century'. </p> <p>There is a raft of successful e-commerce entrepreneurs around Bangalore, in India's version of Silicon Valley. They include Sabeer Bhatia, who sold Hotmail, the web-based email service, to Microsoft for $400 million. These entrepreneurs have given rise to the 'saffron start-up' phenomenon. And their success has provided the networks and investment to help turn Indian software services companies into Nasdaq-listed IT giants. </p> <p>Hewitt will meet Narayana Murthy, chairman of Infosys, the software services company worth $17bn which recently signed a global alliance with Microsoft. </p> <p>Despite the UK's traditional links with India, US companies have stolen a march in forging links with Indian companies, particularly in Bangalore, its technology capital. </p> <p>'Silicon Valley was there first, but the message I want to put across is that we are ahead of the US in the next generation of technology - mobile telephone and digital television,' said Hewitt. </p> <p>There is a thriving Indian-origin business community in the UK, particularly in hi-tech sectors. A London chapter of the Silicon Valley networking organisation, the Indus Entrepreneurs, opened earlier this month. Around 20 UK-based businesses will discuss partnerships in India as part of the trip. </p> <p>Hewitt will see government officials to learn about the development of a network of elite technical colleges, the Indian Institutes of Technology, the hubs for a thriving e-commerce sector.</p>",
  "<p>Boeing, the world's leading aircraft manufacturer, has criticised the Government's determination to sell off part of the UK air traffic control system. The US firm says the plan offers no solution to the problem of an ever-increasing number of planes in European airspace. </p> <p>Seattle-based Boeing had been pondering the merits of joining the bidding for the 46 per cent of the National Air Traffic Services (NATS) being made available to a 'strategic' private sector partner . It decided against a bid because it did not consider the scheme addressed the congestion problem. </p> <p>Harry Stonecipher, Boeing's chief executive, said the privatisation plan was 'not about a solution [to congestion]. As I understand it there it no fundamental change.' </p> <p>'We think there is a total European solution, as opposed to a UK solution.' </p> <p>Stonecipher's comments come at a critical time for the \u00a3500 million NATS sell-off, as a cross-party coalition of peers last week voted by 112 to 90 to delay the project from next March until after the next general election. </p> <p>The vote puts pressure on the Government's Transport Bill, which includes measures to tackle the rail industry. There is speculation it may drop the sale to save the rest of the bill, although the Department for the Environment, Transport and the Regions has maintained that it will press ahead. </p> <p>The congestion problems are acute for both airlines and plane manufacturers. The more crowded the skies, the less attractive flying becomes, particularly in valuable short-haul markets such as Europe. </p> <p>Stonecipher said Boeing plans to unveil a satellite-based system capable of a total overhaul of air traffic management across continents. However, Europe was too fragmented a market in which to launch the system, he added. Political and technical barriers prevented it from being an immediate prospect. </p> <p>Boeing's plan is to launch it first in the US next year.</p>",
  "<p>A new generation of nuclear power stations is being mooted as a solution to serious doubts about the UK's ability to meet targets for the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions. </p> <p>Conservative trade and industry spokesman David Heathcoat-Amory believes construction of up to eight new-generation pressurised water reactors - the technology used in Britain's most modern plant at Sizewell B in Suffolk - should be considered as a possible solution to Britain's energy problems. </p> <p>Heathcoat-Amory, a former Energy Minister, was due to unveil the new policy at a Commons debate tomorrow on the Government's public-private partnership proposals for British Nuclear Fuels. </p> <p>That debate has been postponed, but Nick Gibb, junior Conservative DTI spokesman, intends to argue the case in the rescheduled debate later this month. </p> <p>It will be the first time a major political party has seriously put forward the construction of nuclear power stations since the idea for a third reactor at Sizewell was abandoned in the early Nineties. </p> <p>Heathcoat-Amory told The Observer: 'Taking a blinkered view of this could be cutting off one of the key solutions. There are strong grounds for considering it seriously - grounds of global warming and of security of supply. We should be seeing if nuclear is an option for the future.' </p> <p>Heathcoat-Amory pointed to government figures in the DETR's Draft Climate Change Programme, which predicted carbon dioxide emissions to fall from 1990 levels - 168 million tonnes of carbon - to 152.2m in 2000, before rising to 156.3m in 2010 and 164.9m in 2020. </p> <p>The document itself identifies the tailing off of the current nuclear programme as part of the problem. </p> <p>Dr Helen Wallace of Greenpeace said: 'There is no place for nuclear power as a solution to climate change.

So a company that has increased earnings by sell ing off underperforming divisions, for instance, would not make the grade. </p> <p>Any portfolio containing all 13 companies would be a stellar performer, but they are not easily definable and it would be difficult even for professionals to spot them all. The groups differ, but one thing they have in common is sound management. Unfortunately, this can be impossible to spot without the benefit of hindsight. </p> <p>Equity earnings are the product of a quoted company's efforts over the year, and can indicate how well a group is employing its resources or, more accurately, its equity capital (represented most often by ordinary shares). This capital base is not set in stone from the minute the company floats: it should develop and expand. If used wisely, this extra capital will generate increased equity earnings and a higher share price. </p> <p>To expand, a company will need to borrow at some point, either from the bank or by issuing fixed-interest securities such as unsecured loan stock, debenture stock or preference shares. However, far more can be raised through the issue of new equity or, put simply, extra shares. The amounts raised here, either through a rights issue or a secondary placing, can be as much as the stock market will tolerate. </p> <p>The effect is a virtuous circle, from growth to expansion to profit to growth. Clever managers will be able to generate enough profit to compensate for the new shares, otherwise earnings will suffer. </p> <p>All the companies in our table have locked into this virtuous circle, exhibiting a rising share price along with increased earnings figures. Close Brothers, for instance, was priced at 500p two years ago, but it is now changing hands for 1,180p. During this time, its earnings have increased by 88 per cent. Similarly, Serco Group was 65p five years ago; it is now worth 647.5p per share. Its earnings rose 125.5 per cent in that time. </p> <p>Those losing faith in growth stories will be heartened by the fact that the number of companies in our table has increased from 12 last year to 13. There were only eight in 1998. Last year we named seven companies we thought might make our table this year. </p> <p>Three of them - Capita Group, Close Brothers and Rathbone Brothers - did just that. SmithKline Beecham would have been included if it was not merging with its rival in the pharmaceuticals sector, Glaxo Wellcome. Of the others, Compass Group has become Granada Compass, Hays has failed to increase earnings this year and fund manager Perpetual has yet to report its latest annual results. </p> <p>Investment manager Close Brothers delighted shareholders with its recent results, but even more success could be in store. William Patterson, manager of the Lionheart Winners' Investment Trust, explains: 'Close's record speaks for itself. It has good price momentum, positive newsflow and its recent results were excellent. If the rumours are true about Close selling its volatile Winterflood division, it could be revalued and look cheap.' </p> <p>That would be good news for the share price, which is already a 'buy' with many stockbrokers. </p> <p>Capita Group provides support services for government and the private sector. Business is booming and last year turnover was up 38 per cent, producing increased earnings of 4.06p, up 37 per cent. This success looks set to continue, and last month we added Capita to our Global Nifty Fifty portfolio. Fund managers agree. Manek says: 'Outsourcing is increasing and Capita is one of the best-placed to benefit from that'. </p> <p>But he warns: 'I bought it for the fund last year and sold it in February. Now, I think the multiples are high and it will find it difficult to maintain its previous growth rate.' </p> <p>Investment manager Rathbone has also imp-ressed. Over the last three years turnover shot up 42 per cent and pre-tax profits leapt 108 per cent. The share price has appreciated 17 per cent since the start of the year and 235 per cent over the last five years. Rathbone's interim results point towards 2000 as another year of good progress. The professionals remain positive.Patterson says: 'We think it is a very good prospect.' </p> <p>Other surprise new entrants this year are catalogue retailer N Brown Group and water company Kelda, while Johnston Press, a stalwart of this survey, should continue to do well. The newspaper publisher is expected to increase earnings by around 20 per cent in the current year. </p> <p>Manek says: 'Johnston Press has always been on my wish list but has always been too expensive.' The shares are steadily coming down in price, though, and stand at 315p, off the high of 375p earlier this year. Special mention should also go to Domestic &amp; General Group, Rentokil Initial and William Morrison, as all three were also members of our income stars survey last November. They had all managed to increase their dividend payouts by at least 10 per cent for 10 consecutive years. Coupled with their earnings records, this is a fantastic achievement. </p> <p>Four companies have vanished from last year's table, but only two because of poor performance. Brewers Greenall Group and Morland were both taken over - Morland by Greene King, the third drop-out from last year, proving that using earnings for expansion can hit the balance sheet hard. </p> <p>The fourth to fall from grace was Vodafone, which had a busy year merging with US firm AirTouch and absorbing Germany's Mannesmann. Again, it was expansion and acquisition that harmed the group's formerly fine record. </p> <p>Brokers expect 11 of the 13 groups in our table to increase earnings for the current year. As investment opportunities some of them look better than others. </p> <p>Indeed, some could even be called cheap on current price/earnings valuations, the ratio used by investors to determine how much they are paying for future growth. Used against the sector or market average, it can determine whether a company is cheap or expensive in relation to its peers. </p> <p>Brown's, for instance, is on a p/e of 28.0, which is higher than its sector average of 15.1 and the UK market in general, which is on 21.4. This suggests that any future growth may already have been accounted for in Brown's share price. </p> <p>But Kleeneze, which is in the same sector as Brown's, has a p/e ratio of just 9.3, way below the general retail sector and the whole UK market. So Kleeneze could prove the more astute buy. Others that look cheap include Rentokil Initial, Town Centre Securities and Serco Group. Patterson says Serco 'looks good for upwards earnings revisions'. </p> <p>Rotork, Morrison and Domestic &amp; General look expensive in relation to their peers, but only because the market is expecting greater things from them. If that means another 10 years of earnings growth, shareholders will be more than happy. </p> <p>\u0095 For full details of this year's growth stars, as well as companies which might be next year's, see the November issue of Money Observer, \u00a33.50 from newsagents.

  "<p>Should pensioners invest for their old age? The question is not as ludicrous as it sounds. Increasing life ex-pectancy means many people aged 65 or more could well live for another 20 to 30 years. </p> <p>In investment terms, 20 years is certainly a decent period to acquire some capital growth. However, getting the balance between investment income - what many old people really need in old age - and long-term capital investment growth is quite a trick, especially in today's low interest-rate environment. </p> <p>What, then, are the op-tions for the silver-haired in-vestor? Mark Bolland of In-dependent financial adviser firm Chamberlain de Broe advises looking hard at your income needs first. </p> <p>'A lot of older people want to know how much income they can get from a lump sum. I always turn the question on its head and say how much do you need? Wanting an income of \u00a32,000 a month is all very well but will fast eat up your capital. Asking for \u00a3250 a month gives you far more flexibility in terms of future growth, and won't erode your capital investment so quickly.' </p> <p>Capital ero-sion, especially for 'young' pensioners, can be disastrous, particularly if inflation re-emerges to eat away your purchasing power. So resisting the temptation to tuck into too much pension in-come too early is vital. </p> <p>For those wanting income with the opportunity for a little capital growth, Kim North of London IFA firm Calkin Pattinson suggests looking at corporate bonds. Issued by companies as a form of debt, they are traded in the stock market but pay set rates of return. </p> <p>North says: 'I'm a big fan of these as they are a good halfway house between cash and equities. Both Perpetual's Monthly Income Plus and ABN Amro High Income are worth a look.' </p> <p>But be careful. Although some corporate bond funds provide attractive levels of income, they can expose your capital to some risk, particularly if interest rates go up. This usually reduces demand, which affects prices. </p> <p>Income can also fluctuate. The country's largest corpo rate bond fund, CGU Monthly Income Plus, is cutting its annual income from 7.8 to 6.3 per cent from November. The fund could no longer maintain the higher return without eating into capital. </p> <p>Equity income funds, on the other hand, take a less ambitious attitude to in-come, generally providing yields of around 3 per cent. This means, crucially, that your capital is unlikely to be used up so quickly. Equity income funds are better suited to those who only need a small income top-up. </p> <p>Ben Yearsley, investment manager for Hargreaves Lansdown, suggests looking at Newton Higher Income. 'This fund concentrates on buying out-of-favour stocks on high, sustainable yields and selling them once prices go up - it's a good, classic income fund. Newton staff hold a significant minority stake in the company, so they're highly incentivised to provide results.' </p> <p>Tax-paying pensioners need to look for ways to earn income and growth tax-free. Using up annual allowances for Individual Savings Accounts -\u00a37,000 for an individual in one tax year - is one method. </p> <p>Another route to maximising in-come is through your \u00a37,200 capital gains tax allowance, possibly via zero dividend preference shares - a very complicated name for a simple, low-risk product. </p> <p>Zeros, as they are called, are a class of share in an investment trust that pays no income but a pre-set level of capital return. They are particularly good for low- to medium-risk investors with modest funds. You can cash in the zeros on maturity and use the profit as tax-free income. </p> <p>Rosemary Heaversedge of Shropshire Independent Financial and Mortgage Services says: 'Retired people who want income should look at these, which are relatively low risk.' </p> <p>Older investors should work out how much income they can manage on, how much they might need for potential long-term healthcare costs or help in the house and set aside a rainy day fund of cash. Only then are they in a position to think aboutlong-term capital growth. </p> <p>Share prices have been turbulent recently, particularly those of telecoms, media and telecommunications companies. But shares have historically proved far better investment vehicles than cash or gilts, even in the long stock market downturn in the Sixties and Seventies. </p> <p>Although investing in shares can be risky, you don't have to play too safe and you don't have to confine yourself to buying individual stocks. Taking a small holding in, say, technology or a Far East fund doesn't have to jeopardise your capital too greatly, and can add a little zing to your portfolio. </p> <p>But if you like the idea of investing in straight companies, stick to FTSE 100 blue chips, says Stephen Bland of the Motley Fool personal finance website. </p> <p>'No more than 10 to 15 holdings are needed, even for very large amounts of money. Avoid too much concentration in a particular sector. A couple of banks would be fine, but you don't want eight, even if they are attractive long-term yielders at present.' </p> <p>Bland says another advantage of direct equity investing is that the money can be taken out without penalty at any time - 'not the case with many other investments to which older people are sometimes drawn'. </p> <p>However, as with all stocks and shares, equities need to be watched closely. Com-panies, like any other business, go through their good and bad patches. </p> <p>Points to consider: </p> <p>\u0095 For a non-tax-paying wife whose husband may have a good pension, one tax-efficient manoeuvre is to take out an offshore investment in her own name. Also, consider putting the major part of bank or building society deposits in the wife's name so she can have the interest paid tax-free (ask for form IR85), making use of her personal tax allowance. </p> <p>\u0095 Be careful when looking at with-profits bonds. Although they have performed well in the last 10 years, past returns of 10 per cent annual growth are unlikely to be repeated; 6-7 per cent is more likely to be the new norm. Also, with-profits bonds are commonly perceived as low-risk. They are not. </p> <p>\u0095 Don't turn your nose up at annuities. Despite declining yields they could sink even lower in years to come. For anyone who lives to a ripe old age, a guaranteed income is worth having. The longer you live, the better the deal. </p> <p>\u0095 Remember there is no point in living frugally to maintain capital investment value if your dependents have little need for an inheritance </p> <p>\u0095 After the age of 80, circum stances often change; you are less likely to be seeking capital growth than income. Make sure your financial arrangements are flexible. </p> <p>\u0095 Don't believe everything you read. 'What you must not rely on is company literature saying we have had 19 per cent growth,' says Rosemary Heaversedge. 'You can't rely on past performance tables - I never send clients these as I think they're often misleading.'</p>",
  "<p>The oil giants are set to announce record third-quarter profits as the spiralling price of crude and huge refining margins combine to produce results 100 per cent up on last year. </p> <p>Analysts are predicting that the third-quarter profits to be announced over the coming weeks from UK and European oil majors will represent a 10-year high. </p> <p>Shell kicks off the reporting season on Thursday, with analysts predicting increases of between 70 and 90 per cent on last year's numbers. BP's figures are expected to be even higher. </p> <p>The timing of the results could not be more sensitive for UK oil companies. BP's come on 7 November, the day before Chancellor Gordon Brown is due to announce his pre-Budget report, and six days before the deadline for a fresh round of refinery blockades by demonstrators protesting at fuel duty levels. </p> <p>The Government was angered by the role of the oil industry during the fuel crisis and has sought to deflect blame for the unrest on to the high price of oil, which, it argues, is the cause of the majority of the increase in prices at the pump, rather than high fuel duty. </p> <p>There has been speculation that Brown may alter the North Sea tax regime. But Ministers are concerned that this may undermine investment in the North Sea; they recently said publicly that Brown is unlikely to do this in his pre-Budget statement. </p> <p>However industry analysts and motoring groups argue that Brown could link Petroleum Revenue Tax to the crude oil price without frightening off investment. </p> <p>Commerzbank oil analysts Steven Turner and Clay Smith stated in a research note last week: 'It is difficult to imagine a more favourable environment than that which existed in the third quarter, 2000. Oil prices hit their highest average level since the Gulf war while refining margins have more than doubled in all major refining countries compared with the third quarter 1999.' </p> <p>The average price of Brent Crude in the third quarter of 2000 was $31.3 a barrel, compared with $20.9 a year ago. </p> <p>Commerzbank calculates Shell's net income at $3.17 billion, up 75 per cent on a year ago, although Lehman Brothers has the figure higher, at $3.4bn, up 88 per cent. </p> <p>BP is expected to declare net income of $3.47bn, up 77 per cent on the previous year. Both sets of figures have been driven by the crude price. </p> <p>Commerzbank's Clay Smith told The Observer: 'This certainly represents a 10-year high - and may be an all-time high - but I have only been covering the sector for 10 years. It is worth noting that the US majors have been reporting, and their figures have come in 5-25 per cent higher than analysts' forecasts, so the UK figures could be higher still.' </p> <p>Another reason for Brown's reticence is the threat by oil companies to scale down North Sea investment plans - slated for a 33 per cent increase to \u00a34bn next year. </p> <p>Oil companies argue that their returns are minimal during cyclical troughs in the crude price - determined in part by the Opec cartel - and that they are facing problems downstream at the petrol pump, where high prices work against their margins.</p>",
  "<p>Why are the stock market valuations of dotcoms so volatile? Why do so many acquisitions fail to live up to financial expectations? Why do managers notoriously spend more time debating the paint-job on the bike shed than the training of their employees? </p> <p>The answer to these questions lies in part in one of the most surprising and, outside the business world, least noticed management failures of the past 20 years - the implosion of traditional accounting. Backward-looking and rooted in the needs of statutory financial reporting, conventional accounting has long been of little help to managers in carrying out their day-to-day work. In the past few years the concerns of the two have diverged so far that it has become as misleading as a back-to-front signpost. </p> <p>'An entire industry - accountancy - is based on a fiction: that the valuations auditors produce reflect the real value of the companies they audit,' charges a new report, Dynamic Reporting for a Dynamic Economy, produced for the Academy of Enterprise. 'They simply do not.' Academy founder Professor Alec Reed, chairman of Reed plc and an accountant by training, adds: 'Traditional accountancy should be swept away. We desperately need a new model.' </p> <p>Reed complains that present-day accounting tells shareholders, investors and managers nothing useful about corporate value. It used to be that a company's market value was roughly equivalent to the sum of the physical assets - the land, plant and capital - that industrial companies primarily used to create profits and cashflows. In the new economy, however, even old-line industrial companies rely less and less on physical assets to create value. Value is in fact overwhelmingly generated by the so-called 'intangible assets' which lie at the heart of today's competitive advantage: brands, knowhow, intellectual property, R&amp;D and, above all, people. </p> <p>The result is a yawning gap between corporate stock market valuations - what investors say companies are worth - and the book value accountants attend to. Take Microsoft. Just 10 per cent of its $300bn market capitalisation is backed by physical assets recorded on the balance sheet. Its real value-creating engine, its software development skills, do not appear on the balance sheet at all - which, as Bill Gates has pointed out, 'is probably not very enlightening from an accounting point of view'. </p> <p>In a fast-changing world, cashflows themselves are losing their predictive, and therefore some of their financial, value. In the case of established companies they can vanish overnight; at Amazon.com and other internet high-flyers, valuations are not based on cashflows, and still less on today's meaningless balance-sheet figures, but on the as-yet-unknown options that their ideas, people and customer relations give them. As Reed says: in today's conditions, balance sheets are irrelevant, profit-and-loss statements are misleading, and business plans are not worth the paper they are written on. </p> <p>Behind the Academy's intangibles report is the belief that in future firms may have to reinvent themselves for mobilising and developing people rather than capital. As the report points out, accounting's inability to keep up with this fundamental shift creates all kinds of problems for investors and lenders, favouring insider trading, making 'weightless' companies hard to value, and encouraging market volatility. </p> <p>Just as serious are the side-effects within the firm. It's a management truism that what gets measured gets managed. And all too often 'the fiction of accounting' concentrates managers' attention on the wrong things. </p> <p>For a start, the failure to value people (in both accounting and managerial senses) makes potential acquisitions hard to value and may be a factor in the mispricing and subsequent mismanaging of many large-scale takeovers. </p> <p>Instead of encouraging managers to nurture and invest in their intangible assets, it does the reverse. This is because accepted accounting principles insist that spending on training, marketing, R&amp;D and building the customer base be treated as a current expense rather than an investment for the future. </p> <p>Companies such as Amazon are well aware that weightless assets are the foundation of the internet economy. They minimise spending on physical assets. That know that in a volatile environment, as a recent report from Ernst &amp; Young puts it, 'a company's growth options have become the most important proxy for value, with substantial premiums placed on companies that have the flexibility, management and employee talent, and innovation to create these options'. </p> <p>Valuing intangibles is certainly difficult. Sceptics argue that, because the concept is so fuzzy, attempts to do so could confuse rather than enlighten investors. Yet the absence of approved guidelines hasn't prevented other groups making rough-and-ready estimates of value. Far from fleeing apparently 'assetless' dotcoms, private investors, banks and venture capitalists have flocked to invest in them. </p> <p>Scandinavian companies are developing methods for measuring and managing human capital, some with striking success. Experiments are afoot to value brands, intellectual property, reputation and R&amp;D pipelines. Scenting rich fees, the big consultancies are scurrying to devise scoring frameworks to make intangibles visible and manageable. </p> <p>In private, professionals at the big firms concede that intangibles will change the face of accounting, or acc-ountants will become irrelevant, confined to adding up the bits of the business that matter least. In today's economy, managing intangibles is what managers do - valuing them is too important to leave to the accountants. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:simon.caulkin@observer.co.uk\">simon.caulkin@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Fewer package holidaymakers are returning home disgruntled, new research suggests, but a disturbing 9% of customers still protest that descriptions in tour operators' brochures are inaccurate. </p> <p>All but 8% of those questioned this year were happy with their breaks, compared with 87% in a similar survey two years ago and 90% felt they had received good value for money, a rise of 3%. </p> <p>The research was carried out by MORI for the Association of British Travel Agents, which unveiled the results at its annual conven tion on the Greek island of Kos this week. </p> <p>But if operators are gradually improving quality they clearly still have some work to do when it comes to rose tinted views of resorts or hotels. While the survey indicates greater trust in brochure copy, with 73% of holidaymakers accepting that descriptions were fair against 70% last time, 9% said felt they had been the victims of \"inaccurate representation\". The rest expressed no opinion one way or the other. Within the overall figure, 4%, or around 850,000 people, still \"strongly disagreed\" with the premise that brochures gave a fair picture, compared with 5% in 1988. </p> <p>The number of people booking direct with tour operators rose, from 24% to 27%, but if the research results are to be believed, that figure suggests increasing consumer sophistication rather than scepticism about High-Street travel agents. </p> <p>The proportion booking through agents fell by 2% and almost one third of those who did (32%), thought the advice they got was more trustworthy\" than in 1998. And despite the recent fuss about agents who recommend the holidays of linked operators, 37% believe they provide unbiased advice. </p> <p>Researchers also asked holidaymakers about the impact of tourism on the environment. Almost one fifth (18%) claimed they switched off air conditioning to save energy, 17% said they avoided having towels changed too often, 36% saved water by showering rather than taking baths and 84% avoided leaving litter. Nearly two thirds (64%) claimed they would pay \u00a310-\u00a325 extra for environmental, social or charity reasons. </p> <p>But while just over half of the respondents said they would like to discover more about social and environmental issues in the resorts they visit, 46% said they had little or no interest. </p> <p>And when consumers were asked where they would go if money were no object, Australia won hands down (see the table right). It was chosen by 22%, followed by the United States with 11%. No other destination managed to record double figures.</p>",
  "<p>To watch first-time visitors to my garden when they arrive is interesting. Some look around them to gain a general impression of the scene; others are immediately eyes-down, looking at details of the plants that interest them. Others still, filling in time between lunch and tea, are absorbed in continuing a conversation about their families, friends and their latest holiday abroad. They stride on pretty well regardless of their surroundings, or just head for the nearest seat. They are enjoying themselves in their own way. </p> <p>Curiosity generally spurs me to take a good preliminary squint at my surroundings. Is the house visible and, if so, is it beautiful or hideous? If beautiful, do its surroundings set it off pleasantly? If hideous, how well have the owners managed to conceal the fact? Or perhaps they don't want to, and actually enjoy the very features that I find awful. That in itself can be fun. Especially if you're with a friend whom you can dig in the ribs and have a good laugh with. </p> <p>Is the garden stuffed with features? Features, especially water features, are the in thing currently. My own garden's lack of piddling water spouts, of fountains or of rushing torrents seems to constitute a sad omission in the eyes of some, and they often comment on it. Personally, I hate to be fidgeted by features. The bones of a garden are quite another matter. Frills are easily overdone. </p> <p>What part are trees playing in the garden you are in? Often they fail to be noticed, yet their role is vital. Also, they are not static but always changing, both with the seasons and with the years. They may develop in ways that the owners had not premeditated, and with so much of their own character that their individuality seems worth accommodating. Or they may simply become gaga and an eyesore, yet be hung on to out of familiarity or inertia, waiting for the next big storm to make a messy necessity of removal. </p> <p>Often, you may, as a visitor, be close to, yet fail to notice, a fine specimen of a tree because it is way above your usual sight lines. The kind of tree that I greatly enjoy in an old, long-established garden is an ancient robinia - the false acacia. They become craggy, with deeply fissured trunks; the branches may be quite sparse and leaves scarcely yet apparent as late as early June. Then, giving themselves a shake, there they suddenly are, hung with tresses of white, dark-centred blossom, scenting the air around them. It is an extraordinary transformation and their leaves thereafter are of the airiest. Yet this may be decried as a tiresome tree, liable to sucker and with unpleasantly thorny branches that are prone to dropping off. For the care of anything alive, however, there are always penalties to pay. As visitors, we can applaud the owners' forbearance. </p> <p>Small trees can develop as much personality as big. At Dixter, my home, we have consistently failed to please the walnut, Juglans regia . It is not really difficult; perhaps our soil is too clayey or insufficiently drained. The outstanding feature about a walnut, apart from its pleasing, rounded crown, is its pale bark, which stands out particularly in winter. </p> <p>Fig trees, similarly, have very pale grey bark, which makes them a beautiful winter feature when trained into a wall. But a free-standing fig bush-tree, with many stems, looks wonderful - witness the one standing at one end of the footbridge across the lake in St James's Park in London. That, after a big storm, was stooled to the ground, yet figs take to this treatment as though expecting it. They bounce back with amazing speed and vigour. Of course, a bush-tree of this sort does need a good deal of lateral space, a point that many gardeners fail to appreciate when first planting their gardens. They also fail to take the necessary steps when overcrowding obviously requires a few big decisions. </p> <p>The other point about figs, of course, is the size and shape of their handsome leaves - some varieties, notably the Brunswick fig, have notably more handsomely lobed foliage than others. A fig tree should immediately draw your attention when you catch sight of it in a garden. It is there to be noticed. </p> <p>Tree ferns, notably Dicksonia antarctica , have become increasingly popular in south-of-England gardens since the onset of mild winters and the increased availability of imported material from Tasmania and southeast Australia (with what consequences to native populations, I wonder?). If they can retain their old fronds through the winter, they get off to a flying start the next year and nothing could look more handsome when viewed across a garden from the house's sitting-out terrace. </p> <p>Another agreeably bold plant that has been advantaged by mild winters is Astelia chathamica, with soft, grey-green sword leaves having a bloom on them. They catch the light at varying angles and look strong without the stiffness or solemnity of, say, Yucca gloriosa . </p> <p>We should ask ourselves, too, whether the garden's seats and benches contribute agreeably to its setting. Or do they look pinched and cramped, or clumsy, or stand out offensively because they are too brightly painted or heavily oiled? A seat at the far end of a pergola is a frequent solution for terminating a vista but, when sitting on it, what view have you? Often nothing better than the corner of the house and a couple of dustbins</p>",
  "<b> Mobile phones</b> <p>Initial scientific evidence has found exposure to radio frequency radiation might have subtle effects on biological functions, including the brain. Children may be more vulnerable because of their developing nervous system. The tiny pulses of microwaves emitted by mobile phones are of the same type as the radiation used in microwave ovens. </p> <p>But the safety message is mixed. A DTI report suggested hands-free kits reduce radiation entering the brain. But the Consumers' Association said the kits act like aerials, increasing the radiation. </p> <p><b> GM foods</b> </p> <p>Some scientists fear the artificial nature of modern genetic technologies could damage our environment and health. Ecologists are worried about the danger of herbicide-resistant genes spreading to wild flowers and plants. There is little evidence so far on the dangers but other scientists welcome the development, which could lead to a reduction in the use of pesticides. </p> <p><b> Fluoride in water</b> </p> <p>Opponents claim fluoride causes bone disease, cancer, hyperactive behaviour and impaired intellect, and argue that adding it to water amounts to enforced medication. </p> <p>Supporters say adding it to water supplies would be the single most effective way of improving dental health. </p> <p><b> Nuclear power stations</b> </p> <p>In April, research suggested women living downwind of mudflats that contain discharges from Hinkley Point in Somerset have twice the risk of breast cancer. Leukaemia clusters have been found near all three nuclear reprocessing plants.

  "<p>Terry Matthews is Wales' first and only billionaire, and rated one of the five richest people in Britain. But at first sight the goatee-bearded man in the unprepossessing suit, shirt and shoes in the lobby of the Celtic Manor Resort, Newport, Gwent, barely looks the part: more like a Valleys politician or small-scale entrepreneur. Until he speaks. Out comes a torrent of words, anecdotes, stories, accompanied by a whirlwind of gesticulations. </p> <p>He is an inveterate story-teller, a chronicler of south Wales' industrial history. A group of Vancouver tourists gawp in bafflement and awe as he recites the tale of the Powell family, founders of the Powell Duffryn engineering group, including the fate of a scion eaten alive in what is now Ethiopia, and then moves on to Swansea's role as the hub of the global non-ferrous metals industry for two centuries. \"I like history, industrial history,\" he tells them, pointing to a brass railing in the lobby. \"You know where brass comes from originally. Swansea. That's where.\" Then he is gone, out on to a nearby green of one of the three championship golf courses surrounding the \u00a3120m resort and off into local Roman history. \"See over there, just beyond the clubhouse, there's the remains of a Roman training camp we found, and [a sudden switch of gear] over here we're building corporate golf suites.\" </p> <p>But this global player has his eyes fixed firmly on the present and future. His roots may be in south-east Wales, in the Gwent valleys but home is Ottawa and north London - and the revolutionary world of broadband telecoms technology and the high-risk, high-stakes domain of venture capital. \"The ability to communicate in broadband is a dramatic instigator of change in everything we do in life and I'm not going to miss out on it,\" he says by way of dispelling any suggestion, his billions made, he is ready to retire at the age of 57. </p> <p>Matthews is good at two things: networking and networking. He devises solutions and applications for telecoms networks. Brash, pugnacious, ruthless, demanding he may be - \"I take concrete with my cereal\" - but he gets on with people. Celtic Manor, which he founded two years ago on the site of the boarded-up nursing home where he was born, is, with its 400 rooms, 32 suites, convention centre and golf courses, a magnet for \"the most senior people\" in the global telecoms industry. \"For some reason they all love golf and I can use the hotel as a base to conduct business - and, no, I don't have time to play.\" </p> <p>He has made his money in two ways. First, by building up his own businesses and selling them on, and by providing the seed-corn for spin-offs and start-ups. An obsessive fixer of things - clocks, bikes, cars - in his native Newbridge, he started work at 16 in BT's research labs in Dollis Hill, north London, and turned holidays in Ottawa at the age of 26 into a permanent stay. He set up Mitel in 1972, making integrated circuits and inventing private switchboards (PBX). \"We set it up with $4,000 of borrowed money and now it's making $1.5bn revenues.It doubled its revenues every year for the first 11 years and generally in electronics a successful company can do that and remain stable. Anything above that can be unstable.\"</p> <p>The company ran into problems with the break-up of AT&amp;T in 1982 and he sold a 51% controlling stake three years later to BT. By then a multi-millionaire, he founded Newbridge Networks a year later and earlier this year, 15 years on, sold it to Alcatel for \u00a34.4bn, taking a 3% stake in the French group to become its biggest individual stockholder. \"Alcatel's shares have just about doubled since the acquisition which is good for them and their shareholders, and employees of Newbridge.\" </p> <p>He talks excitedly about the spin-offs or affiliates he has helped nurture. \"In my career I have started up around 40 companies and I have lost only two, when the normal success rate is one in 10, and some of them have had an absolutely staggering success.\" He reels off a string of businesses: Vancouver-based Abatis, set up with $5m and sold four years later to Redback of California for $1.2bn; Bookham; Encipher; Orchestry. </p> <p>Matthews uses as his funding vehicle Celtic House Investments, set up in 1994 and run by an old school friend, Roger Maggs. He says he has invested $100m in the past five years and the companies he so far has not floated are alone worth well over $1bn. \"This coming year we will put in $250m. Investment capital has dramatically escalated in the last 12 months, just for Celtic House alone. There's more venture capital available than over the past five years, more than any time be fore.\" The main reason he cites is the potential unleashed by broadband networking, seeing an exponential, explosive growth in digital subscriber lines, digital cable modems, local multi-point distribution services and the like. </p> <p>\"Demand grossly outstrips the ability to supply and the point is that these networks are always available, always on, rather than having to be accessed by dialling via a modem,\" he says, a host of statistics about the potential growth pouring forth. \"Anything you've seen in the last 10 years in networking technology is just the tip of the iceberg. This is one of the most exciting developments ever in human endeavour because networking is fundamental to every aspect of life.\" </p> <p>Matthews has, therefore, no time for the doom-laden forecasts that the \"inflated bubble\" cocooning the Ciscos, Lucents, Nortels of this new world, even BT, is about to burst. \"Absolutely not, there may be a few problems now with the share prices but this is such a titchy bit of the iceberg and the value of the overhaul of the network - imagine, 1bn lines to be upgraded - is so staggeringly high that the entire sector will continue to do well. And the applications are even bigger once the basic highway has been laid. \"Until you put the roads in, the cars, buses and garages can't happen. This is dramatic and it's now. You've got to take advantage of the infrastructure and the applications, as in one or two years all the roads will be in place.\" For all his self-confidence he sees his own role in this process in a strangely coy manner. \"Timing in life is everything. If I had done this five years ago, surprise, surprise, there were no roads to run the cars on and now there are. All it takes is just awareness of what's going on to be innovative and inventive,\" he says, a trifle disarmingly. \"There will be losers as they will not be able to accommodate this dramatic change but opportunities are opening up like never before and you don't have to be a builder of the big switchers and optical networking to do well.\" </p> <p>The first application of broader bandwidth he sees is in fast-responding internet services - a graveyard for profit expectations until now. But his own sights are set on what he calls videocentric applications: using broadband networks in areas ranging from security and surveillance to health care, where he promises a budgetary revolution. </p> <p>Matthews is now chief executive of March Networks, an Ottawa-based offshoot of Newbridge that used to be called Telexis which itself specialised in digital video recording products for security and operations management. Earlier this month, March took over Elcombe, which provides technological solutions for the health-care market, for $15m equity and a share swap. The expanded company, he says, has secured $35m in equity funding. </p> <p>\"I can now do things for senior citizens in terms of health care which will help deal with a chronic shortage of nurses, for instance,\" he says. The new digital video applications can enable a nurse to treat or care for 15 patients online each day, compared to the perhaps five he or she might visit or see in a hospital or clinic. He is thinking ahead, according to his own motto: \"Don't be boring, do something\" or \"make a mark, don't be part of the living dead\". Amid this restless activity he still had time that day to take part in an \"innovation summit\" at his Celtic Manor resort and put the finishing details to his bid to stage the 2009 Ryder Cup, due to be submitted on Tuesday. It seems like a heroic one-man endeavour to put Wales on the map. </p> <p>The summit, attended by Rhodri Morgan, first secretary of the national assembly for Wales, came less than 24 hours after Panasonic became the latest Far East electronics group to scale down its Welsh operations, with the loss of 1,300 jobs. Matthews brushes aside this bad news in favour of the opportunities opening up for artists and content providers in Wales. \"We've got to create this entrepreneurialism and this is what they should focus on and they are. It's the first time in Wales I have ever heard anyone as prominent as Rhodri focus on such things. It's like a breath of fresh air.\" </p> <p>Terry Matthews, rich dynamic man of the world with a penchant for being a bon viveur, says he is trying to bring a taste of that world to his native country through his hotel complex above the M4. Even his new company, March, like Newbridge before, retains its Welsh origins - the name a play on pre-Tudor times when the region was known as Wales and the Marches, an ill-defined territory with no fixed border. \"Henry VII was born in Monmouth and was the Welsh person who became king of England, and his son, Henry VIII, nailed down the border. And broadband is disputed territory.\" It is a rich region where he would like to be king - and, like his Tudor predecessor, seems ready to chop off a few heads to do so. </p> <p><strong>The CV </strong></p> <p><strong>Born:</strong> Newport, Gwent, June 6, 1943 </p> <p><strong>Education:</strong> Schools in Newbridge, Gwent.

  "America's most powerful politician will not be elected next month. For those on the receiving end of US foreign policy, at least, that person, arguably, is Jesse Helms. The hawkish Republican senator from North Carolina is well into his fifth, six-year term. He does not face re-election until 2002. In the meantime, he continues as chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee which, in concert with Congress as a whole, holds the purse strings and has oversight of almost every aspect of US global diplomacy. Nor is Mr Helms at all bashful about exercising his considerable powers or advancing his trenchant opinions. <p>In the past few weeks alone, Mr Helms has denounced Yasser Arafat as a \"terrorist\"; dismissed Iranian reform efforts as \"hogwash\"; described Fidel Castro as a \"deadbeat\" and \"swindler\"; condemned normalised trade relations with \"communist China\"; ridiculed the \"sorry performance\" of UN peacekeepers in Sierra Leone; blasted the Clinton administration for \"inexcusable\" delays in building a national missile defence system; and hammered away at the old enemy, Russia. </p> <p>Thanks in no small measure to Mr Helms, the US has in recent years defaulted on its UN dues, tried to block the planned international criminal court, failed to ratify the comprehensive test ban treaty, been slow to deploy ground troops in both Bosnia and Kosovo (and whinged about it ever since), imposed sanctions on dozens of countries it dislikes, pursued a fruitless, destructive vendetta against Iraq and swung, ideologically speaking, towards an ever more overweening unilateralism. </p> <p>All this goes down a treat in rightwing circles at home. When George W Bush talks of pulling troops out of the Balkans, Mr Helms's influence is at work. Some foreigners are impressed, too. Lithuania recently gave him the illustrious Medal of Grand Duke Gediminas to add to his two Senate Golden Gavels and his US police federation Golden Eagle Award. All the same, it really is time that Mr Helms, aged 79, slowed down a bit.</p> <p>Luckily, an opportunity is at hand. If the Democrats can gain five seats on November 7, they will retake control of the Senate and Mr Helms will lose his chairmanship. They may also win the House of Representatives. There are many reasons for wishing the Democrats success in the congressional elections. But for vote-less foreigners, the reactionary, Blimp-ish Mr Helms is the most pressing.</p>",
  "Neither the grieving relatives, who hoped for retribution, nor the ministers and civil servants, who feared exposure and humiliation, should have expected Lord Phillips's CJD report to set Whitehall ablaze with avenging fire. Official inquiries never have that sort of vulgar result. <p>Everyone knew that the withdrawal of the Royal Navy's survey ship from the South Atlantic convinced the Argentine junta that Britain no longer cared about the Falkland Islands. But Lord Franks absolved the government, which had saved \u00a33m by bringing HMS Endurance home and spent \u00a31.6bn on the war which that decision provoked, from all blame. </p> <p>Sir Richard Scott judged that \"parliament and public were designedly led to believe that a stricter policy towards non-lethal defence exports and double-use exports to Iraq was being adopted than was, in fact, the case.\" Then he concluded - with fine disregard for dictionary definitions of \"designedly\" - that ministers had \"not acted with any duplicitous intention\". The establishment rarely condemns its own. </p> <p>There is nothing dishonest nor discreditable in the basic instinct to believe the best about men and women who devote their lives to public service. The great and the good take it for granted that other members of that elite group are (like themselves) doing their honest best. They may make mistakes. But error is not an automatic reason for severe blame. </p> <p>Indeed, wherever possible, blame is to be avoided completely. A marginal overstatement of legitimate criticism might convince the tabloid-reading public that ministers are either profoundly incompetent or deeply corrupt. Then the stability of the whole system would be imperilled. And stability is the establishment's primary pre-occupation. Politicians can abuse each other without serious people taking very much notice. But if a high court judge, master of an Oxbridge college or retired senior civil servant exposed the processes of government as rotten, our comfortable world would never be the same again. </p> <p>So it was no more reasonable to expect Lord Phillips to denounce and condemn the BSE ministers than it would have been to expect his participation in a street demonstration against global capitalism. He did his job in strict conformity with the precedents - a rigorous analysis of what went wrong but a determination not to allocate an iota more blame than the most generous interpretation of responsibility allowed. When, earlier this week, Mr John Gummer refused to acknowledge that he was the man on the end of the mobile telephone, he should have told the assiduous reporter who had discovered his number that he was too busy sighing with relief to speak. </p> <p>Lord Phillips conceded that two ministers of agriculture (John Gummer and Douglas Hogg) and Stephen Dorrell (when he was secretary of state for health) underplayed the risk of eating infected meat. \"The public,\" the report says, \"was repeatedly assured that it was safe to eat beef.\" Eighty families now know that not to be true. But at least it can be said in the government's defence that, for a time, it actually believed its own propaganda. Then ministers realised that transmission to humans was possible. But \"believing that the risks ... were remote\", it played them down because it was \"preoccupied with preventing an alarmist over- reaction\". </p> <p>Lord Phillips concludes that \"the campaign of reassurance was a mistake\". </p> <p>Amen to that. But it is less easy to endorse his judgment that \"the government did not lie\". It was certainly - to use the latest phrase to be added to the establishment lexicon - \"economical with the truth\". Lord Phillips observes, with magnificent judicial restraint, that, when the risk of death and infection was confirmed, \"the possibility of a risk to humans was not communicated to the general public or to those whose job it was to enforce precautionary measures\". That sounds to me like the intention to deceive - the best definition of a lie which is available to us. </p> <p>The lie was collective. But individuals - both civil servants and ministers - were, even by the judgment of the Phillips report, individually guilty of confusing public understanding. Sir Donald Acheson, the chief medical officer, gave unsustainable assurances about beef safety - and later attributed them to a slip of the tongue. Douglas Hogg, the minister of agriculture, tried to persuade members of the government's BSE advisory committee to back his public statements on the remote possibility of infection.</p> <p>That, Lord Phillips says, was \"not a desirable exercise\". Even John Selwyn Gummer, excoriated at the time for publicly feeding his daughter a hamburger as part of the reassurance campaign, is said to have been put in an impossible position by the media. The BSE report does not excuse or exonerate the guilty. It just treats them very gently. </p> <p>That does not mean that the report has failed in its task. It has identified crucial shortcomings in the machinery of government - most of them associated with the Ministry of Agriculture, which has long been recognised as little more than a client of the industry which it blatantly represents rather than supervises. A blow of sorts has been struck against secrecy, the enemy of good government and the ally of inadequate administration down the ages. </p> <p>But will a new generation of ministers and administrators take any notice of that admirable advice if, after reading Lord Phillips's conclusions, they are confronted by the belief that, even when they transgress, they will not be held up either to contempt or ridicule? </p> <p>I doubt if Lord Phillips would argue with my judgment that, after identifying innumerable errors and mistakes, his report leaves readers with the feeling that, for most of the time, both ministers and civil servants were doing their best. Perhaps they were. But if that was the case their best was woefully inadequate - not least because their behaviour was dominated by the belief that avoiding trouble and maintaining good order and discipline was the first duty of government. </p> <p>It has been a good week for Douglas Hogg, John MacGregor, John Gummer and their Ministry of Agriculture civil servants, but a bad one for publicly accountable government. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.bse.org.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">BSE Inquiry</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.bsereview.org.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">Food Standards Agency BSE Review</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.maff.gov.uk/animalh/bse\" target=\"_NEW\">MAFF BSE site</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.doh.gov.uk/cjd\" target=\"_NEW\">Department of Health BSE/CJD site</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.humanbse.org.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">Human BSE Foundation - voluntary support group</a><br> <a href=\"http://sparc.airtime.co.uk/bse\" target=\"_NEW\">BSE news and research</a></p>",
  "The BSE crisis, as Helen Grant reminds us (Letters, October 27), goes back to 1989. But even before that, in 1979, the victorious Tory government threw out the recommendations of a royal commission on animal feed and deregulated the industry, with catastrophic results. A Tory legacy of poll tax, recession, sleaze etc, and a railway system that is only safe when it is not working: I just hope the electorate remembers all this and consigns these scallywags into oblivion at the next general election. How sweet PR looks now, Tony. <br> Phil Cubbin <br>Oxton, Wirral <br>PhilCubbin@cwcom.net <p> </p> <p>\u0095 I note with sadness that two teachers may well face criminal charges over the incident at Stainforth Beck where two children drowned. As an ex-head of geography who has conducted 20 \"river studies\" in that very stretch of water, I can probably say \"there but for the grace of God ...\" </p> <p>I also note that the directors of Railtrack, on whose line four people died, do not face any such charges, despite the fact that the track was unsafe. They knew this accident could happen. </p> <p>And I note that ministers in the last Tory government, along with their civil servants, do not face serious charges despite the fact that they encouraged us to eat poisoned meat with the result that at least 80 people have since died (Denial, failure and betrayal of the public, October 27). </p> <p>If the teachers may face serious charges, then so be it. But why is the same principle not applied to ministers, civil servants and the directors of public companies who may be guilty of criminal negligence, greed and political expediency, rather than a desire to provide extra curricular activities? Why am I angry and confused? <br><br>Jim Ryan <br> Batley High school <br>ryan@ls185ps.fsnet.co.uk </p> <p>\u0095 But they did lie to us. We listened to Farming Today and the Today programme and we read the Guardian. As a result we gave up eating all beef products in 1987. They lied to protect their jobs, their power bases and their \"reputations\". They lied about thalidomide, global warming and the safety of Windscale. They still lie to us about GM foods. All we can do is to listen to those quiet voices which seek to warn us - particularly if they (the establishment) tell us that those quiet voices are scaremongers. <br><br>Wendy and Peter Richards <br>Thorpe Bay, Essex </p> <p>\u0095 The Phillips Report on BSE details yet another instance of actions by ministers and civil servants having huge adverse financial implications for the taxpayer.

  "<p>Psion, the hi-tech company best known for its handheld computers, faced a crisis of confidence in the City yesterday after warning that a collapse in demand for its modems would push its annual profits \"well below\" analysts' expectations. </p> <p>The news led to a fall in the company's shares of 165p to 410p, wiping \u00a3650m, nearly 30%, off its market capitalisation. Analysts questioned whether the management could deliver on other projects, such as its Symbian venture with the world's leading mobile phone companies. </p> <p>Psion's chief executive, David Levin, said: \"Of course this is disappointing, it's particularly disappointing to me. </p> <p>\"But does it impact one's view of our strategy? The answer is no.\" </p> <p>Psion has been hit by a technological shift as an increasing number of laptop computers are manufactured with built-in modems. This has meant that fewer people are buying Psion's detachable PC card modems. </p> <p>Although the modems business, Psion Connect, had anticipated such a change, the effect has been more sudden than expected. Psion Connect's next products, a range of wireless modems, are not due to be introduced until next year. Mr Levin said: \"I don't feel we've been tardy or acted inappropriately with this - quite the contrary. Maybe we announced that this would happen too early and people have forgotten we predicted it.\" </p> <p>Psion's problems have been aggravated by rising prices for commodities such as memory chips, and by the weak euro, which means its European earnings are less valuable. </p> <p>The profits warning provided ammunition for critics of the company, who suggest that its core handheld computers are losing ground to competitors such as those of the Californian company Palm. </p> <p>Mr Levin denies this, maintaining that because Palm Pilots are cheaper and have no keyboards they are targeted at entirely different customers. The firm has also been hit by rumours that it has been losing key staff, although insiders claim this is a false allegation that has been spread by a disgruntled former employee. </p> <p>Furthermore, Psion's Symbian joint venture, which is to develop operating systems for net-enabled mobile phones, has been hit by revelations that two partners, Ericsson and Motorola, have been talking to other computer companies. Mr Levin pointed out that they both still stress their commitment to Symbian. </p> <p>Philip Smith, an analyst at Teather &amp; Greenwood, said: \"The general environment for Psion has not been good. When you bundle all these factors together it's not a pretty picture.\" </p> <p>Founded 20 years ago by Zimbabwean physics professor David Potter, Psion is one of Britain's most successful technology firms but its shares have historically been volatile. Microsoft boss Bill Gates famously identified the firm in 1998 as his corporation's \"number one threat\". </p> <p>Before yesterday's warning the group was predicted to make profits of \u00a36.7m. </p> <p>Psion spent \u00a3250m last month buying Teklogix International, a Canadian maker of handheld scanners.The group said integration was going well, with costs likely to total \u00a33.5m.</p>",
  "<p>'What kind of spider understands arachnophobia?\" sings Ian Maidman in the uncompromisingly English accent of the young Robert Wyatt. There may be people out there with no comprehension of Wyatt's oddball oeuvre, or even with a phobia for anything from the short-lived art-jazz-rock phase of pop culture, but that's of no concern to anyone at the Queen Elizabeth Hall tonight. The former Soft Machine drummer/vocalist has amassed a generous sprawl of music that wraps itself comfortably around the good-humoured performers Annie Whitehead has assembled for this tour under the banner of Soupsongs: the Songs of Robert Wyatt. </p> <p>Friendly ghosts at the banquet included the late Mongezi Feza, whose tune Sonia opened the show. There were tributes to saxophonist Gary Windo and any number of impeccable influences, from free jazz and the Liberation Music Orchestra to several flavours of South American music. Yet Wyatt's songs are as English as tea and toast, with a political sting. \"Simplify, reduce, oversimplify,\" chant Julie Tippetts and Maidman at the head of Left on Man. \"What we call freedom in the north/ means our freedom to use you,\" he croons over a gentle Latin groove. \"And if you don't co-operate/ we'll cut off your supply lines/ but you'll be free to reconnect/ if you beg our forgiveness.\" The critique of global capitalism doesn't limit the power and warmth of Wyatt's music - there's more affection in a couple of his lopsided chord changes than the entire back catalogues of Elton John and Neil Diamond. </p> <p>The first Soft Machine single was Love Makes Sweet Music (written by Kevin Ayers, but sung by Wyatt) which bombed, but sounds so much like a hit you wonder what would have happened if they had gone to number one in 1967. Instead, the Softs became a cult progressive outfit, injecting the influence of jazz and systems music into the rock mainstream before splintering in several contradictory directions. Wyatt's accent, his explosive drumming and his questioning nature have been hugely, quietly influential. </p> <p>The Soupsongs band doesn't include Wyatt, though he was installed happily on the front row. It is based around Whitehead regulars Liam Genockey (drums) and Steve Lamb (bass) plus Janette Mason (keyboards) and Julie Tippetts (nee Driscoll) sharing lead vocals with Maidman. The horn section is completed by trumpeter Harry Beckett and saxophonists Larry Stabbins and Lol Coxhill, all on superb form. Tippetts is as wonderful, particularly on the spine-chilling Alliance, which develop, from an eight-note phrase straight out of The Maids of Cadiz (in the Gil Evans version) into ecstatic heavy blues with the horns coming on like the Brotherhood of Breath. A favourite moment was hearing Beckett play the simple tune of Left on Man and then splashing joyous squiggles of sound all over the chord sequence: the trumpeter played like a dream all evening. </p> <p>Dondestan was an opportunity for everyone to show off, with virtuosic brushwork from Genockey and a brief, hilarious bass solo from Lamb. Whitehead is the perfect hostess for what felt like a big family party. All the anger and fire embedded in Wyatt's music seems to come from a love of people rather than a hatred of oppressors. And the elliptical originality of the early work hasn't been dimmed by time and the disappointments of life. Perhaps he knew it all at the beginning: love really does make music sweet. </p> <p>\u0095 The Soupsongs band play the Wardrobe, Leeds (0113-383 8800), tonight, then tour to Coventry, Warwick, Brighton and Oxford.</p>",
  "<p><strong> The subject </strong> </p> <p>East is east, and west is west, and never the twain shall meet. Except on dinner tables from Berkeley to Bermondsey, where Pacific Rim (aka, fusion) cooking may be observed in action. Like most developments in cooking, reassuringly, it isn't new at all. When 17th-century English cooks developed a craving for nutmeg from the Molucca Islands of Indonesia, they were doing fusion. So were the Indian and south-east Asian cooks who took the chilli pepper (native to Mesoamerica) to their hearts, minds and bellies from around the turn of the 16th century. </p> <p><strong> The basics</strong> </p> <p>Fusion cooking is an elusive concept, but if you want a definition, try this: cooking that freely mixes ingredients, methods and equipment from every part of the globe, with results that can't be identified with a single national cuisine. On occasion, the Knowledge wishes it had never been invented: some chefs turn their global larders into fusionistic dog's dinners. About as appetising as mouldy bread, and better described as con fusion. But when it's good, it's very, very good. And you can do it successfully in the privacy of your own home. Herewith, the Knowledge's top-10 starting-point ingredients ... </p> <p><strong> The details</strong></p> <p><strong> Fusion fodder 1: noodles</strong><br> The shapes of Asian pasta are few (basically, round or flat long noodles, a bit like vermicelli, spaghetti or linguini), but the starchy matter - hubba hubba! - is something else. It can be egg and flour, buckwheat, rice, soy beans or mung beans (as in Chinese \"cellophane\" noodles), in addition to plain old wheat flour. Japan has the greatest variety, China follows close behind. Use them as a side dish, sauced as you please. They make the best noodle soups, the best noodle salads, and the only stir-fryable noodles. </p> <p><strong> Fusion fodder 2: lemongrass</strong> <br> One of the most seductive flavours on earth. Top and tail, slip off the tough outer husk, bruise at brief intervals with the dull edge of a knife, and slice or chop for use in soups, braises, salsas or saut\u00e9s. Creamy chicken soup flavoured with lemongrass and coconut does the Pacific Rim job sensationally. </p> <p><strong> Fusion fodder 3: lime leaves</strong> <br> Lemongrass's constant companion in Thai cooking and even more extravagantly aromatic. There's almost nothing in which the Knowledge wouldn't consider using these green goddesses, but they were made for soups and sauces, shellfish and chicken in any guise, and anything with garlic. The dried version is acceptable, but fresh is best. </p> <p><strong> Fusion fodder 4: dashi</strong><br> One of the basic flavours of Japanese food. Dashi is a mixture of dried bonito and dried seaweed, reconstituted in water to make a broth of wonderfully delicate flavour. This is your friend for fused soups, sauces and gravies. Instant versions are widely available. </p> <p><strong> Fusion fodder 5: ginger</strong> <br> Will get Knowledged in full at a later date. If I had an extra page or two, a full listing of ginger's possible uses would be possible. In the meantime, consider ginger in: meatballs, burgers, braised carrots, fishcakes. </p> <p><strong> Fusion fodder 6: galangal</strong> <br> Ginger's rarer cousin. Galangal is almost chilli-hot, and has to be used in moderation; but when it's used well, watch out!</p> <p> <strong> Fusion fodder 7: Asian greens</strong> <br> The stuff called \"Chinese cabbage\" (often from Israel) is ubiquitous and okay, but a good Chinese supermarket or food shop will present you with things you've never seen before. You won't know their names, but you will fall in love when you take them home for sacrifice on the fusionistic altar. Treat them as you would spinach, celery or fennel. Braise them, steam them, stir-fry them, add them to stews for the last 15 minutes of cooking, stir them into the juices from a roast chicken or piece of pork.</p> <p> <strong> Fusion fodder 8: fish sauce</strong> <br> The odour repels some people, and why shouldn't it? Made from dried, salted fish, it smells a bit like a mackerel tail that got stuck to the side of the rubbish bin and stayed there all weekend. But used in small quantities, it makes gravy, steamed veg, potato gratins or even salad dressing zoom into the stratosphere.</p> <p> <strong> Fusion fodder 9: Chinese five-spice powder</strong> <br> A fragrant mix of star anise, cloves, cassia, fennel seeds and Sichuan peppercorns. If this stuff hadn't been invented in China, it would have been invented in Europe, so perfect is it in a multitude of western devices. In baked goods, or dusted on to a duck breast or pork chop, or in a fusionistic rice pudding or rice pilaf, and in marinades - this quintet has legs. Run with it. </p> <p><strong> Fusion fodder 10: soy sauce</strong> <br> The grandaddy of east meets west cooking and truly a case of last but not least. Soy sauce isn't just for stir-fries. It's also for seasoned butter, vinaigrettes, seafood salads, gravies - you name it.</p> <p> <strong> Fusion reading 1: Simple Good Food, by Jean-Georges Vongerichten and Mark Bittman</strong> (Kyle Cathie) Food from the several Vong restaurants, which many people rate as the best examples anywhere, made truly accessible for home cooks. </p> <p><strong> Fusion reading 2: Ken Hom's East Meets West Cuisine</strong> (1988, sadly out of print, but you might be able to pick up a copy secondhand) A pioneering book from the days before the term \"fusion\" had been coined, from a cook who's equally well grounded in Asian and European cuisines. </p> <p><strong> Fusion reading 3: The Sugar Club Cookbook, by Peter Gordon </strong> (Hodder &amp; Stoughton) One of the foremost exponents of fusioning. </p> <p><strong> Webbed fusion:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.foodoo.com\">www.foodoo.com</a>, where Hom and John Torode, another seasoned fusioneer, figure in a cast of media-beloved cooks. </p> <p><strong> Where to buy</strong> </p> <p>Asian ingredients are always best and cheapest at any shop serving people who associate the word fusion with nuclear physics - that is to say, at Asian food shops. The four branches of the Wing Yip supermarkets (<a href=\"http://www.wingyip.com\">www.wingyip.com</a>) are a good place to start. Ordinary supermarkets are okay for soy sauce and a few bottled or jarred items, but the mass-market brands they sell aren't always the finest in fusion. </p> <p><strong> The easy way out</strong> </p> <p>Experiment, within reason, and don't worry about it.

  "<p>The tok-tok-tok of a stick banging against a hollowed-out wooden block outside my house was clashing with the more sonorous timbre of a small gong being struck repeatedly. Further down the street, a high-pitched whine was competing with the blander sounds of a man banging a spoon against a plate, another banging a spoon against a glass, a third banging an indiscernible object against some wood and a fourth who seemed to be shouting, \"Me! Me! Me!\" </p> <p>This grating cacophony, which varies slightly every day, depending on who is around, means only one thing - lunch, quite literally, is on its way down the road. Each sound is the signature tune of one of the dozens of food vendors trundling his (they are almost never her) wares around the streets. That tok-tok-tok means that the meatballs, usually with noodles, are approaching. The gong signifies ice cream. The whine comes from a copper steamer used to cook rice flour and coconut cakes. The spoon rapped on a plate means either a mixture of congealed sticky rice, tofu and other delights, or chicken soup and rice. The spoon against glass means desserts, particularly fruit jelly drinks, while the banging on wood is usually fried rice. Me! Me! Me! indicates not an annoyingly self-centred exhibitionist but a fried noodle seller (\"mie\" means noodles). </p> <p>These ubiquitous kitchens are little more than a two-wheeled trolley, known as a kaki lima (five legs). The legs in question are the trolley's two wheels, the wooden stand that supports it at one end when stationary and the chef's own two feet. Despite being the slowest thing on the road, they seem to have carte blanche to go where they like, when they like - it's not uncommon to come across an unlit kaki lima going the wrong way down the fast lane of a triple-lane thoroughfare at night. Any collision would be blamed on the car driver. </p> <p>Kaki limas, their sounds and drivers' habits are but one facet of a street food culture that is, unsurprisingly, as varied as the country's 13,600 islands. In Minahasa, say, a region of northern Sulawesi, the wags say that the only things with legs that are not eaten on the street are the chairs and tables. In West Sumatra, the home of Padang cuisine, the food comes in two main varieties: very spicy and mouth-burning hot. And across the heartland of Java, most stalls cater to the popular refrain, \"Belum makan nasi, belum makan\" - \"If I haven't eaten rice, I haven't eaten\". </p> <p>Despite such regional variations, common themes run throughout the country. The first is that street food is a feast for all the senses, not just the tastebuds. As the kaki limas highlight, sound is as important as anything else in differentiating the choices on offer. Visual elegance, too (both of the food on the plate and the stall), is crucial to success, although it tends to go by the wayside once a stall is established. The heady aroma of freshly cooked food is a common feature at any bus station or market, and does wonders to dull the stench of reeking drains, smoke-belching buses and sweaty people. Cutlery is an undesired luxury - the preferred means of eating is using the right hand (the left is reserved for other tasks, toilet paper being scarce in rural Indonesia) to compress food into a ball and pop it into the mouth. </p> <p>Food from most provinces can be found all over the country. Padang food is one example, as are the Warung Tegal stalls, named after the central Java town where they originated, that serve basic rice and noodle dishes. As a result, any Indonesian who is far from home can usually find something they recognise and are comfortable eating. This hints at another strong feature of Indonesian street food: it has changed little over the years, because Indonesians tend to be conservative eaters. Most actually hate cooking, but they do know what they like and are not inclined to experiment. </p> <p>Mr Sastro typifies this attitude. He opened his warung in Jakarta in 1958, and has not altered the recipes (chicken fried rice and two types of fried noodles) since: \"I've never even thought about changing things. People like what I cook and I don't want to risk losing them.\" </p> <p>Like is a major understatement. People come from miles around to eat his rice and noodles or to grab a takeaway portion wrapped in a banana leaf. \"I don't mind waiting half an hour for my food,\" says Eduard Harlen, who had come six miles on the back of a motorbike taxi to get his supper. \"He gives generous helpings that are delicious.\" Word of Mr Sastro's offerings reached society's upper echelons decades ago, and it is not uncommon to see ministers' cars parked outside. \"Usually, they only send their drivers, but sometimes the bigwigs come themselves,\" says Mr Sastro. </p> <p>Price is another reason for the lack of innovation. With more than 50 million Indonesians earning less than \u00a31.50 a week, much of the population cannot afford anything but the basics. It is uncanny how this lowest-common-denominator factor has prevailed, and it certainly shows no sign of being superseded by any nouvelle trends. </p> <p>The most amazing aspect of Indonesian street food, however, is what it does not include: namely, the spices (nutmeg, cinnamon and cloves) that first put the archipelago on the global map some 600 years ago and that prompted Christopher Columbus to sail across the Atlantic in search of the eastern Indonesian Banda islands. Few can explain why they are not used, except, perhaps, that they do not go particularly well with either rice or noodles. </p> <p>Fear of catching some dread lurgy is what prompts most foreigners to avoid warungs and kaki limas like the plague, and head instead to the smarter hotels and restaurants. But, more often than not, the latter, if anything, pose a greater threat to your health, because the food is prepared hours in advance and just left out, whereas on the street the food is cooked in front of you. </p> <p>So, if it's a genuine taste of Indonesian cuisine you're after, don't head for a hotel. Just walk down the street and take your pick from the dozens of meals on offer. Or, if you're feeling lazy, just wait for the trolley orchestra to come your way.</p> <p><strong> Tips</strong></p> <p> It is practically impossible to create truly authentic Indonesian street food in any indoor kitchen because there is no artificial replacement for the magic je ne sais quoi that is picked up in the pan over years of outdoor use on a grubby kerosene stove and never properly washed off. </p> <p>Indonesians love spicy food, and usually add chilli sauce to everything. This can kill the flavour, so it might be advisable to go easy on the chillies, especially the spicier green ones. </p> <p>Indonesian meat is often very tough. To make it tender, people boil it for an hour or so before frying or grilling. </p> <p>Another common ingredient is MSG - when following recipes that include MSG in Indonesian cookbooks, it might be better to omit it. </p> <p>In recipes that stipulate goat, lamb is a perfectly acceptable alternative. </p> <p><strong> Mr Sastro's fried rice or noodles </strong></p> <p> Per portion. Melt some margarine in a wok. Add chopped garlic and red onion, and any herbs and spices you like (Mr Sastro uses a little bit of cardamom, coriander and lemongrass), then cook until the aroma starts to tickle your nostrils. Throw in as much cooked rice (or noodles) as you want, some boiled chicken cut into pieces, finely chopped white cabbage, a tablespoon or two of chicken stock, some beaten egg and a teaspoon or two of crushed fresh chilli. Season with a little vinegar, sweet soy sauce and salt and pepper. Mr Sastro boils the chicken gizzards, chops them into slices and mixes a few into each portion. Serve with lettuce leaves and sliced tomato and cucumber. To make it a special, add a turned-over fried egg. Most younger chefs use vegetable oil instead of margarine. </p> <p><strong> Satay </strong></p> <p> Use any meat, or prawns. The meat should be cut into bite-sized portions and marinaded for at least three hours. Some street chefs use more than two dozen ingredients in their marinades. The basics are two tablespoons of chilli oil, two tablespoons of sweet soy sauce, half a teaspoon of lemon juice, one crushed clove of garlic and a teaspoon of salt. Then add whatever takes your fancy, such as ginger, grated candlenuts, tamarind juice, coriander, shrimp paste softened in warm water, chopped chilli, red onions, pepper, a bayleaf. It's best to cook the meat over charcoal, but you can cheat and use a gas cooker. </p> <p>Satay is usually served with two sauces: a soy sauce mixed with chopped chillies, red onions and a dash of lemon juice; and a peanut sauce. There is a wide variety of peanut sauce recipes, but an easy way out is to use the same one as used for gado-gado (below), only without the coconut milk. </p> <p><strong> Gado-Gado</strong></p> <p> An Indonesian salad that is a meal in itself. Tofu, cabbage, beansprouts, egg, spinach, green beans, watercress, cucumber, carrots. Some Indonesians like to cook their gado-gado, others like it part-cooked, and others still prefer it raw, apart from the tofu, which should be fried in oil until brown, and the egg, which should be hardboiled. There is no correct answer. Once the salad is assembled, pour over the peanut sauce. </p> <p><strong> Peanut sauce </strong></p> <p> Ingredients: 1 tbsp vegetable oil, 1 clove crushed garlic, green chilli (amount depends on your tastebuds), 1 tsp brown sugar, 1 tbsp tamarind juice, tsp salt, 1 chopped onion, 4 tbsp chunky peanut butter, 1 small piece lemongrass, 1 dab shrimp paste, 1 tsp sweet soy sauce, 3 tbsp coconut milk. Fry the onion and garlic in oil. Mix the peanut butter with 150ml water and bring to the boil. Remove from the heat, add the chilli, lemongrass, brown sugar, shrimp paste, tamarind juice, soy sauce and salt. Add the onion and garlic. Stir in the coconut milk. Simmer over low heat. If it is not smooth enough, liquidise it, but the chunks add a little extra something. </p> <p><strong> Beef rendang </strong></p> <p> A Padang dish.

  "Four years ago, when Tony Blair published a collection of speeches unconvincingly subtitled 'my vision of a young country', the country reacted like an aged spinster being flattered on her youthful looks. 'Not that young, silly,' we said, but glancing at ourselves in the mirror; perhaps we glimpsed the remnants of youth, and, briefly, decided to see what Tony meant. By now, we're back to our old selves. We form disorderly queues and take it in turns to complain about others wasting our money. And, of course, we reflect on the good old days. <p> One aspect of what has become a widely recognised 'boom' in history is certainly pure nostalgia, from the burgeoning membership of the National Trust and English Heritage to the enthusiastic celebration of anniversaries, such as the Battle of Britain. There are many criticisms levelled at the Millennium Dome, but a consistent one is that the past is only represented in it by a special episode of Blackadder, as if the only thing to do with history is snigger at it. The history boom can, however, be distinguished from the heritage boom. In recent years, sales of historical books have vied with those of novels. These are not only books about 'our' past, but about the past in general, from Stalingrad to the Russian Revolution, from Norman Davies's Europe to Felipe Fern\u00e1ndez-Armesto's and John Roberts's global perspective.</p> <p> Meanwhile, history 'on the ground' - the viewer figures for Time Team, the numbers participating in local and family history, digging in the archives - has never been so healthy. The latest indications of a belief in the popularity of history is the backing given to the Simon Schama series, The History of Britain. Schama follows in the footsteps of AJP Taylor, the first great populiser of history on television. But is today's newly popular history the real thing? Does more, as Kingsley Amis glumly used to predict, mean worse? </p> <p> Changes to the history syllabus in the national curriculum provoked predictable reactions from certain quarters earlier this year. The shift from teaching 'named individuals', ie, kings, queens, prime ministers, their battles and elections, was seen as disastrous. Various polls show the shocking ignorance of our schoolchildren about even the most basic historical events. It turns out, however, that the changes in the curriculum are a shift in focus to encompass more than the traditional, rather than a denial of the role of the individual. I would certainly have appreciated learning that Edward I was responsible for the expulsion of England's Jews (in 1290) as well as the victory over Wallace at Falkirk (1298). Traditional history teaching passes over the former event (the old Oxford history gives it half a sentence) while dwelling on the latter. It is encouraging to see that Schama's series evokes the expulsion as vividly as he does the battle of Hastings in an earlier episode.</p> <p> In terms of education, certainly, it seems precipitate to accuse any change of being for the worse. After all, the ignorant respondents to the polls were presumably being taught under the old system, and while you can always look up a date, it is surely more important to get a general outline of the past. This does not mean flattening out the past to be a slower, dirtier version of the present. One of the main reasons for the success of popular history books has been a return to a strong narrative line. People enjoy revisionism, rewritings offered by the likes of Andrew Roberts, Norman Davies and John Charmley. But more straightforward, well-written accounts of very different periods and events, from Antony Beevor's Stalingrad to Amanda Foreman's Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire, have proved equally popular. </p> <p> Narrative history used to be looked down upon in academic circles, where the meticulous analysis of a Namier or the number crunching and big theory of an EP Thompson were deemed more serious. Nowadays, not only is it accepted that very few can bring such approaches alive (though Thompson certainly did), but analysis and argument are seen as essential ingredients of narrative. Far from dumbing down, the popularity of historical writing seems to have encouraged academic historians to be more ambitious in their approaches. </p> <p> Fern\u00e1ndez-Armesto's latest book takes environmental factors as the linking device to compare civilisations across continents and thousands of years, and it seems likely that, once again, readers will be seduced by his magpie technique. One of our greatest, and most popular historians, Lord Macaulay, wrote that, 'history, at least in its state of ideal perfection, is a compound of poetry and philosophy. It impresses general truths on the mind by a vivid representation of particular characters and incidents.' He went on to complain that, in his time, the historical novel had overtaken straight history as the most popular way of interpreting the past. It is a sign of our times that, for all the popularity of historical novels, we insist on the novelist getting his history right. Historians of the present day are engaged, not in simplifying, but in attempting to refine Macaulay's compound closer to its ideal. </p> <p>\u0095 David Horspool is history editor of the TLS.</p>",
  "Germany had just surrendered, the war against Japan was still going on, London and many other British cities were covered in rubble. But John Maynard Keynes wanted the country to know that those who cared about such things were taking steps to ensure that the brave new postwar world would not only have new social and economic policies, but something hitherto unheard of in British history: a cultural policy. <p> \"I do not believe it is yet realised what an important thing has happened. State patronage of the arts has crept in. It has happened in a very English, informal, unostentatious way - half-baked. A semi-independent body is provided with modest funds.\" It was with these words that listeners to the BBC were informed in July 1945 of the creation of the Arts Council. The tensions which were to dog the Arts Council throughout its history were evident in the very terms of Keynes's celebratory remarks. 'Access' was to be in competition with 'excellence'; culture was at once lodged in the past as 'heritage', but also located in creative and participatory activities in the present.</p> <p> And aims were mixed in other ways, too: Keynes spoke of the need \"to make London a great artistic metropolis\", but also pledged the new body to \"let every part of Merry England be merry in its own way\" (the grand-opera-plus-morris-dancers view of 'culture'). The only really unequivocal statement was Keynes's cry from the heart interjected in the middle of his broadcast (and which no official spokesperson for the arts would dare to utter these days): \"Death to Hollywood.\"</p> <p> The history of the Arts Council is important not just because it became the main funding body for the arts, but because it functioned as a kind of microcosm of the relation between politics and culture in Britain in the second half of the 20th century. At first, the 'culture' it fostered largely corresponded to the traditional tastes of the cultivated elite; then in the 1960s and 70s, it attempted to do right by various forms of 'popular' culture; finally, in the 1980s and 90s it fell in with the prevailing economism of public discourse, treating culture as one of the 'leisure industries' which contributed to the GNP - or as the Thatcher-appointed Arts Council chairman, William Rees-Mogg, put it in 1985: \"The arts are to British tourism what the sun is to Spain.\"</p> <p> These developments were conditioned by social attitudes towards culture which had deep historical roots. Summarising ruthlessly, one might say that the dominant tradition in Britain had been an uneasy mixture of indifference, suspicion, and the largely unreflective perpetuation of the tastes of the traditional upper class. It has often been argued, most influentially by Matthew Arnold in the mid-19th century, that the pervasive impact of Protestantism, especially in its Puritan form, and the power of the commercial middle class in the world's first industrial nation combined to produce a suspicion of, or resistance to, culture that deserved to be called 'philistine'. But Britain's traditional elites, too, contributed to this uneasy relationship. The court and the metropolis were less the focus of upper class cultural life than in some other European countries; the landed classes tended rather to be provincial in their attachments and rural in their pursuits. </p> <p> It is true, of course, that historically most of the 'high art' forms were dependent upon the patronage of the wealthy classes, but in Britain even these were (and perhaps still are) primarily pursued as conventional elements in an established social season: where a visit to the opera at Covent Garden might be seen in much the same light as a cricket match at Lords or the regatta at Henley. This in turn helped to fortify popular hostility to these art forms and, although the labour movement's high regard for education has left its monuments in the statute-book in the form of public provision of schools and libraries, the arts have only attracted limited attention from the chief reforming governments of this century. </p> <p> Seen against this historical backdrop, the long absence in Britain of any kind of 'Ministry of Culture' is hardly surprising. In place of a 'cultural policy', Britain has had a miscellaneous collection of cultural institutions, with varying degrees of status and public support, whose operation has depended upon the shared values, social contacts and tacit agreements among leading members of the social and professional elites. Anything more explicit or systematic threatened to grate on those British sensibilities which detected a totalitarian resonance even to the phrase 'Ministry of Culture'. As Lord Goodman, the then Chairman of the Arts Council, drily remarked in the 1960s: \"One of the most precious freedoms of the British is freedom from culture.\"</p> <p> Prior to the second world war, the only public provision of culture took the form of the central government's responsibility for certain major museums and art galleries. The first steps towards the public provision for 'the arts' were prompted by a concern for the morale of the civilian population during the conflict itself. The Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts was set up in 1940; it was initially intended both to assist people to perform music and drama for themselves and to make the work of professional performers more widely accessible, though the latter aim soon predominated. In 1945 the warm glow of victory led many wartime expedients to be looked upon with favour, and all political parties concurred in transforming CEMA into the Arts Council. The establishment of the Arts Council may have represented a significant extension of the 'range' of activities receiving public support, but the 'means' adopted conformed to an established British pattern.</p> <p> The guiding principle remained that of 'arm's length' administration: that is, a system where public funds were not disbursed directly by a government department, as in most other European states, but were allocated to intermediate bodies which were charged with fulfilling certain public obligations - usually phrased in very general terms - and then left free to disburse the funds as they saw fit. </p> <p> As far as Westminster and Whitehall were concerned, both the level of political attention given to the arts and the size of the sums involved remained negligible for at least the first two decades after 1945. But then in 1965 the Labour government signalled its intention of pushing the topic up the political agenda by appointing a junior minister with special responsibility for the arts. In practice, subsequent governments, especially Conservative ones, tended to resist any expansion of the power and prestige of this office: the Arts portfolio was shuffled around various ministries, never commanding a ministry of its own, and so the minister concerned was in a correspondingly weak position when negotiating with the Treasury for an increase in its spending powers. </p> <p> Until 1992, the Arts Minister headed the Office of Arts and Libraries; it was a junior post which did not bring membership of the Cabinet. Inevitably in recent decades, with the heightened political profile of conservation and 'heritage' issues, with the greatly increased political clout of the 'tourist industry', and with the alleged economic benefits of a thriving 'arts sector', numerous issues which might in other countries be classified as the responsibility of the Ministry of Culture have come under the supervision and sometimes the control of government. But administratively these responsibilities remained dispersed until very recently. Thus, the Foreign Office oversaw the work of the British Council, the body whose task is to disseminate British culture abroad. The Department of the Environment was responsible for various historic buildings and other sites of national interest. The Home Office had overall responsibility for radio and television, though the cinema fell under the Department of Trade and Industry, while the Office of Arts and Libraries was administratively in the charge of the Lord President of the Council, having previously been under the Department of Education and Science.</p> <p> Some may see in this a wise Burkean system of internal checks and balances in which no one department has a monopoly of 'cultural policy'; others may see it as a characteristic muddle, only tolerated because the British have traditionally not taken 'culture' seriously enough to merit the formulation of effective procedures and policies for its support. From its beginnings, the Arts Council was subject to criticism from various quarters, especially on the grounds of its being too 'elitist' and taking too narrow a view of its functions. But there were also mounting misgivings about the way in which the council operated, and critics on both the left and the right of the political spectrum urged that its freedom be curtailed (generally urged by the right) or its constitution be altered (generally urged by the left). Neither the process of appointment to the main council and its panels nor the funding decisions they took were open to any kind of democratic control: much appeared to depend upon the close social links between members of the metropolitan elite.</p> <p> In this vein, it has been suggested that the reason why the independence of such bodies as the Arts Council involved no great tension with successive governments until the 1980s was that the members of these bodies so deeply shared the attitudes and values of the traditional political class. In the 1960s and 70s, as part of wider social changes, the council came under pressure to take a more democratic or popular view of the cultural activities that should be funded. To a limited extent the council did extend the range of its clients, though one of the main consequences is that it came under further criticism from Tory backbenchers who complained that public money was being used to support 'indecent', 'subversive', or simply 'mediocre' artistic activities. In fact, it is clear that for some time now the Arts Council has uncomfortably juggled various, not always consistent, criteria in making its decisions. </p> <p> In the mid-1980s, under Rees-Mogg, it thumpingly declared its commitment to 'excellence', but taken narrowly this was always bound to conflict with the council\u00cds duty, as laid down in its charter, \"to increase the accessibility of the arts to the public throughout Great Britain\". The relative autonomy accorded to the Regional Arts Councils further complicated the picture, since they tended to look more favourably on a variety of 'community' or participatory activities than had the parent council. Although the big cultural satrapies such as Covent Garden, ENO, the National Theatre and the RSC were always its major clients, the overwhelming bulk of the support provided by the council was in smaller grants to a huge variety of organisations - dance companies, local theatres, individual writers, poetry magazines, crafts associations, and so on. </p> <p> The Thatcher governments of the 1980s exercised one obvious kind of influence by their reductions in the real value of the arts budget, but they also exercised a more insidious influence by manipulating the system of appointments to the relevant public bodies along simple partisan lines. Thus, for example, in 1980, shortly after the Tories had taken power, the self-made businessman Alastair McAlpine was nominated for membership of the Arts Council. There was immediate protest, since not only did McAlpine have no obvious qualifications or experience in the arts world, but he had already noisily expressed his opposition to any public subsidy to the arts. The protest was overridden by the arts minister's revelation that \"this nomination comes from a very high source\"; McAlpine has been one of Mrs Thatcher's closest supporters and a fervent advocate of 'free-market' policies. </p> <p> Then in 1982 Richard Hoggart, a literary and cultural critic with a distinguished career in education (and a man of moderate Guardian-reading leftwing views) who had for some years served very effectively as vice-chairman of the Arts Council, was abruptly dismissed. This was contrary to established practice and against the stated wishes of the chairman and the rest of the council. When pressed, the (Tory) arts minister confessed it was because \"Number 10 doesn't like him\". Rees-Mogg was appointed as chairman the following year. When Roy Shaw, the long-serving secretary-general of the Arts Council, retired later the same year, he wrote an article for the council's Bulletin regretting this increasing politicisation of appointments. Rees-Mogg attempted to prevent the publication of the article, which only led to its receiving vastly greater publicity by its appearance in the Observer. </p> <p> The official view in the closing decades of the century was that any shortfalls in public provision would soon be made up by private sponsorship, but the problems with this assumption have become increasingly clear. Sponsorship is another form of advertising, and thus introduces its own demands, whether in the form of opera programmes printed in the colours of a well-known cigarette company or, more worryingly, of pressures towards 'safe' and uncontroversial events. The one new ministry set up by John Major after his election victory in 1992 was the Department of National Heritage, embracing tourism, sport and the arts. The title aptly reflected the prime minister's sepia-tinted views: village greens and country houses are part of the nation's 'heritage', experimental theatre and minimalist art are not.</p> <p> In practice, what really transformed the relation of government to the arts were the huge yields from the new national lottery. The capital infrastructure of culture became heavily dependent on what Adam Smith famously described as \"a tax on ignorance\"; regular funding channelled through the Arts Council was now only part of the story. After Labour's victory in 1997, the title 'the Ministry of Culture' was finally established. It retains broadly the same heterogeneous remit, which reflects the current deep confusion about the distinctive nature and value of art. In so far as there is an organising principle, it is economic: these activities are grouped together as a category of 'optional' consumer choices, they are 'leisure industries'. By the end of the 20th century, costume dramas had become the emblematic 'product', milking heritage to help the export drive. 'Death to Hollywood' has mutated into 'long live Merchant Ivory'.</p> <p> Broadly speaking, therefore, what has happened is that one, largely extraneous and inherited, form of confidence has been eroded without being replaced by another which would allow discriminations of quality to be persuasively made on intrinsic rather than merely instrumental grounds. We are now encouraged to think of works of art not as expressing some of the deepest probings of the human condition, but as leisure products whose 're-branding' will contribute to 'national competitiveness'.

As a tool of cultural analysis it is now merely outdated. \"The people versus the power-block: this, rather than 'class-against-class', is the central line of contradiction around which the terrain of culture is polarised.

  "<p>Craig Masson and Andrew McMinn recently threw a \"very tropical and exotic party, to celebrate 10 years of married bliss\". The invitations, which flew out of canary-yellow envelopes, were a zazz of hearts, flowers and glittery palm trees. There was a strict dress code (Carmen Miranda, Hula Boy, Showgirl, Tarzan, Knickerbocker Glory, etc), and though I didn't make it myself, the \"boyz and girlz\" who did spilled out of the Miami kitchen and the rococo-colonial lounge into the garden, where they mingled with pink plastic flamingos and drank oceans of fizz under strings of dangly party lights shaped like pineapples, bananas and slices of watermelon. </p> <p>Masson and McMinn, who drop words such as \"poptastic\" into normal conversation and wear Hawaiian shirts as part of their day-wear, were dressed as the Beatles in Sgt Pepper mode. They had given the hall floor a coat of lurid green paint for the occasion. Even the garden statuary was wearing orange taffeta. That's the kind of fun guys they are - but you don't have to go to one of their parties to enjoy a little of the light they shed on life. </p> <p>The couple are the founders of Kitschen Sync, the two-store London retailer that trades in \"a glorious kitsch-a-rama of flashy, trashy trinkets\". Their shops (one in Clapham, another in Covent Garden) offer a world of gnomes, snowstorms and Sputnik lights, cocktail swizzle sticks, lips, lanterns and glitter mirrorballs - all presented in the display cabinet equivalent of retro 50s kitchen units. Their mail-order catalogue is 18 colour pages of jokey product placement: \"Having a party in a dinghy? Don't forget the inflatable ice bucket!\" (Yours for \u00a32.50.) </p> <p>In essence, they specialise in cheap crap (rubber goldfish, glow-in-the-dark goddesses, fuzzy dice, funky phones and all manner of frivolous fakery from fruit and foliage to fur), but Kitschen Sync's founders don't believe in palming off any old cheap crap - their business was born out of a genuine affection for the gaudy colour and good humour of classic bad taste. Not only have they travelled the world - China, Mexico, India, Thailand, Holland and, um, Enfield - to find the stuff, but there's barely anything in their shops that they wouldn't have in their own home. </p> <p>\"Our kitchen is very Kitschen Sync,\" agrees Craig, when I join them for breakfast in Victorian- terraced Balham, where we sit around a retro table in chrome and lemon-yellow laminate (\u00a3275) on matching vinyl chairs (\u00a3120 each), surrounded by Formica (bespoke units by their Covent Garden shopfitter; colour scheme by Marge and Homer Simpson). The table is set with leopard-print mats and co-ordinating paper napkins. \"More tea, vicar?\" asks Andrew before refilling my jolly mug (a discontinued line) from an even jollier teapot decorated with poodles and Lassie lookalikes (a gift from a friend). </p> <p>Kitschen Sync, they tell me between mouthfuls of sticky chocolate croissant, was originally inspired by a shop in Amsterdam that they came across during a weekend break in 1997. \"Most of the stuff was from Mexico,\" says Craig. \"There was lots of colourful plastic, all very fun and quirky. We didn't think it was as cheap as it should have been, but we were sure there was a place for a similar shop in London.\" At the time, neither of them was looking for a business opportunity - Craig was a freelance display designer, Andrew a lingerie merchandiser for House of Fraser - but the idea took root and grew. </p> <p>The concept and, indeed, the name, Kitschen Sync, was dreamed up on the Eurostar on the way home from Amsterdam. Within a few months, they had found a maker to produce their own-designed leopard-print candles; Craig had set up a market stall to fund the time spent on drawing up a business plan; and every spare moment was spent sourcing suitable material. \"We look for quirky design and fantastic colour,\" says Andrew. \"But we also cater for nostalgia - things that people remember as kids, like plastic polka-dot beakers or Duralex glasses from Woollies.\" </p> <p>There is also an element of imported souvenirs. One of their bestsellers (and one of their personal favourites) is an \"exuberant, flamboyant\" Mexican Corona beer tray, featuring a sunny senorita in a scarlet sombrero. \"When you think about the icons of kitsch, it's often the stuff that people bring back from holiday,\" says Andrew. \"People are seduced by these things - the donkeys, the flamenco dolls, the windmills from Amsterdam - but when they get them home they look alien, they stand out. And I suppose that's what we sell ... things that stand out.\" </p> <p>At Masson and McMinn's effervescent home, almost everything stands out in one way or another. The only kind of magnolia they would tolerate is in fake flower form. They don't go in for \"white goods\", either (the fridge is yellow). Their fearless use of colour has no inhibitions - those Miami-style units in the kitchen, for example, mix lemon with mint and rose pink with sky blue; the floor is a harlequin of blue and green tiles; the walls are turquoise and yellow; and the paintwork is a hot, hot pink. </p> <p>The living room, according to Craig, \"is kitschy colonial ... a bit rococo-y, a bit Pierre and Gilles\". To get the look (Andrew calls it \"tongue in chic\"), line all walls with animal-print wallpaper. Cover one in a collection of gilded sunburst clocks and mirrors, dating from the 30s to the 50s. Add two large \"lovely jubbly\" sofas in tiger-print, place a tall \"kitschy religious\" Virgin Mary in one corner and drape garlands of fake flowers, \u00e0 la South Pacific, down the windows. They have also raided their storeroom for multi-coloured chandeliers (a Kitschen Sync speciality, \"fashioned from real plastic\", from \u00a319 each) and flocked plastic deer heads (\"that grand hall look without the taxidermy\", \u00a312.50). Most people couldn't live with one of the latter; Masson and McMinn have an entire herd of them mounted on a bright red wall. </p> <p>But the living room is a model of sobriety compared with the \"70s disco\" bathroom. Here, a fuchsia-painted roll-top tub sits on a raised platform surrounded by wall-to-floor mosaics in psychedelic colours - yellow, blue, turquoise, more hot pink, a bit of scorching pink, a touch of green. The ceiling is all mirrored mosaics. The wall above the tub is lined with original 70s vinyl wallpaper in more shades of puce and pink. And the bathroom is not even finished yet. \"What's missing is some Top Of The Pops album covers for the walls and a big swivelling bucket chair - all plastic and shiny,\" says Craig. \"And we'd like one of those 70s display cupboards, y'know with flaps, and doors, mirrors and lights.\" Mmmm, lovely. </p> <p>Few people have the courage or the inclination to go to these extremes, but Masson and McMinn believe that Kitschen Sync has successfully filled a niche in modern retro interiors. \"We are not trying to sell a whole package or a whole concept,\" says Andrew. \"What we offer is accents of colour and touches of humour. Even people with lovely, tasteful kitchens will throw in a shocking pink kettle for fun, or something wacky in the bathroom like a fluffy pedestal mat.\" </p> <p>Kitschen Sync, they say, is a \"fashion shop\", responding to whimsical trends (snakeskin is the new leopard print, apparently), but it caters for all tastes. Oh, really? \"Yeah, I think there's something here for everyone,\" says Craig. </p> <p>When I test out the theory with a visit to their Clapham shop, I go into kitsch-a-rama overdrive and am seduced into buying a Barrier Reef shower curtain (\"a taste of warm tropical waters without the risk of becoming a shark's hors d'oeuvre,\" \u00a319), one of those Corona beer trays (\u00a310), two strings of fruity party lights (\u00a315 each), a squeezy tomato ketchup bottle (\u00a33) and a square foot of realistic fake grass sprigged with spring flowers (I haven't got a clue what I'm going to do with it but, at \u00a33.75, who cares?). </p> <p>According to Andrew and Craig, I am a fairly typical customer, combining gift-buying and impulse purchases with a little light home accessorising. But there are all sorts of Kitschen Sync shoppers. Some wouldn't dream of crossing the threshold, but others are addicts. \"You'd be surprised by the number of customers who tell us they've got everything we sell,\" says Craig. \"And we are still catering for those who actually have, well, dubious taste,\" says Andrew. \"There is an element of people who don't see the irony. There's no tongue in their cheeks. They buy stuff because they genuinely think it's nice.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Kitschen Sync, 9 The Pavement, Clapham, London SW4, and 7 Earlham Street, Covent Garden, London WC2.
