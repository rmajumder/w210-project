  "<p>Leylandii, the fastest growing, most numerous and most hated tree in Britain, is finally to be called to account for the mayhem it has caused in suburbia. Council chain saw hit squads are to be given the power to enter gardens and cut problem hedges down to size, bringing relief to many an overshadowed home.</p> <p>Yesterday the environment minister, Michael Meacher, announced new legislation to curb the cupressocyparis leylandii which, he says, has, more than any other issue, filled his postbag since the general election with \"thousands of ruined lives, many legal battles and even violence\". </p> <p>Following a public consultation begun last year, an astonishing 97% of the public wanted the government to sort out leylandii - 94% supporting the idea of legislation to allow them to be compulsorily cut down.</p> <p>Nearly eight out of 10 local authorities, exhausted by fruitless efforts to sort out disputes between neighbours, wanted the power to act unilaterally if hedge owners would not cooperate.</p> <p>The ubiquitous plant, once praised for its robust constitution and ability to set roots down virtually anywhere, has been the culprit in numerous court cases pitting neighbour against neighbour.</p> <p>It has even spurred a police manhunt for a bizarre arsonist who has been targeting gardens in Leeds suburbs where the offending trees have been set on fire in the dead of night. Never in the history of gardening has a single plant caused so much trouble - or a Latin name so readily entered the English language.</p> <p>The tree, an accidental hybrid between two unrelated fir trees from North America which occurred on the estate of the collector C J Leyland in 1888, was once thought a boon for gardeners. They were marketed as graceful but \"flourishing in any soil, standing up to fierce winds, free of pests and disease, and growing like rockets\".</p> <p>It was this last trait that has caused the trouble. Some varieties of leylandii grow readily 3ft a year. From a tiny start in the 1960s when nurseries learned to propagate the tree easily, there are now an estimated 55m in Britain and around 300,000 are sold every year.</p> <p>Because the trees are still relatively young, no one knows how high they might grow but one in Kent is already 150ft and hedges of 60 to 70ft are frequent.</p> <p>The most celebrated legal battle involving the tree lasted seven years, cost \u00a3100,000, and reached the court of appeal. It involved Michael Jones and his neighbour Bernard Standon of Bournville in Birmingham, who quarrelled over a 35ft leylandii hedge which Mr Jones had leaned over and trimmed by 9ft. </p> <p>Mr Jones won his case because of local covenants on the estate in Birmingham which prevent nuisance to neighbours but dozens of other cases have been lost on the basis that an Englishman can do what he likes in his own garden. Many people have been fined for criminal damage for taking unilateral action like Mr Jones, because they were not protected by covenant. Mr Jones founded Hedgeline to help them. The organisation, which has 3,000 members whose lives have become dominated by disputes over out of control boundary hedges, has been campaigning for a change in the law.</p> <p>Two years ago the group took its case to Downing Street. Like the avenging army of Malcolm approaching Macbeth it hid its numbers under branches of leylandii but left the government in no doubt about the strength of feeling.</p> <p>Mr Meacher knows the weight of his postbag. \"This has caused huge feeling. A vote of 97% in favour of action on any issue does not happen outside the Kremlin normally. \"There are tens of thousands of cases of private disputes between neighbours. There is a depth of anger and misery which high hedges cause which cannot be overstated - this show of public opinion proves it.\"</p> <p>He said that there would be no prescribed height limit for hedges. In some cases to shield houses from wind or traffic nuisance a high hedge could be justified but in small suburban gardens matters were different. \"It will not be hard for local authorities used to dealing with planning matters to sort this out. Mediation is the best answer but in the last resort the councils must have the power to physically intervene, and that means sending in the chain saws.\" Mr Jones said: \"We are delighted to have a firm pledge that this nuisance will be finally dealt with. There are a lot of hedge victims out there who need urgent help.\"</p> <p>He urged the government to support the private member's bill currently before the House of Lords, which would give local authorities the power to intervene in hedge disputes, and Mr Meacher said yesterday that he would consider it.</p> <p>Clare Hinchcliffe, a Hedgeline organiser, compiles case histories of violence and court cases. She said: \"Many of our members are old ladies and timid people bullied by monster hedges which cut the light out of their homes and their gardens and dominate their lives. They suffer years of anxiety as the hedges grow bigger and bigger and they are powerless to do anything about it.</p> <p>\"If at last they can get relief by appealing to the local authority to mediate and if that does not work to apply compulsion that is wonderful news. Let us hope it comes soon.\"</p> <p><strong>A growing history of trouble</strong></p> <p>\u0095 John Gibbons from Sunderland is still paying \u00a340 a month out of his pension after being fined \u00a32,000 for cutting a few branches from his neighbour's leylandii two years ago. He made a dent in it at the time, he says, but it is still growing and its 18ft height in winter blocks the sunlight from his home. His wife Aline said: \"The magistrates did not even come and look. Next door has a garden the size of a football pitch and the trees are miles away from their house. Our house is only 15ft away and the garden is so much in the shade no sunlight penetrates. There has been nothing we can do about it, but it is an injustice.\"</p> <p>\u0095 A keen gardener appeared in court yesterday charged with the murder of his next door neighbour. Llandis Burdon, 56, was shot in his own home after an alleged dispute over a 6ft- conifer hedge. His neighbour Uri Bowen, 61, was charged with the murder of Mr Burdon, a retired environment agency official. The two men were neighbours in Station Road, in Talybont-on-Usk, near Brecon, Powys, for more than 20 years. </p> <p>\u0095 At least six leylandii blazes in the Bramley area of Leeds in one month last December were begun with lighted newspaper, probably sprinkled with lighter fuel. Leading firefighter Nigel Kitchingman, of West Yorkshire fire brigade, said at the time: \"We think someone has a vendetta against the trees and is determined to get rid of them.\"</p> <p>\u0095 Retired postman Phil Bodenham, 79, lost his life savings - some \u00a315,000 - after trimming leylandii branches which he felt encroached on his garden at Cliffords Mesne, Gloucestershire. He was alleged by neighbour Alan Barnard to have cut off six inches two much, taken to court, fined \u00a3200 in damages and ordered to pay \u00a315,000 costs. </p> <p>\u0095 George Whitmill was hit with a bucket of water and a shotgun was fired in Hopwood Green, Newbury, Berkshire, in May this year after a dispute broke out as Mr Whitmill attempted to trim a neighbouring hedge. A man was questioned over the shotgun discharge.</p>",
  "Italians are joyously if carefully unfolding towels on one of the longest and most beautiful coastlines in the world - with a ration of just 15cm of space each. <p>The room for lying on some beaches has shrivelled to the length of a pencil as 20m vacationers simultaneously try to get away from it all.</p> <p>Expanses of Mediterranean and Adriatic sand have vanished beneath forests of suncreamed limbs which must twist to avoid hitting neighbours. \"Being slim is not a mere cosmetic benefit but a requirement,\" said Italy Daily.</p> <p>Congestion has forced football and volleyball to be abandoned in favour of electronic Playstation versions.

  "<p>Aston Martin yesterday rode the seemingly unstoppable crest of global demand for luxury sports cars with plans to build a new assembly line in Gaydon, Warwickshire, and take on an extra 400 staff. The company, owned by Ford, said it would produce a new, cheaper model of the sports car favoured by James Bond, executives and royals on the 900-acre Land-Rover test facility just off the M40.</p> <p> Its plans to expand output underlined the stark contrast between the gloom which has descended upon volume car production in the UK and the boom in the market for luxury models - not only in Britain but around the world, with Bentley, Bugatti, Lamborghini, Porsche and MacLaren Mercedes planning new cars. \"There's certainly a whole rash of new entrants into the luxury end of the market while the volume end is treading water and the top of the range end is going gung-ho,'' an Aston Martin spokesman said.</p> <p> The company, founded in 1913, expects to produce a record 1,000 cars this year, including 900 of the DB7 model, and to raise output to 1500 next year. It sold just 46 cars in 1992 but hopes to overtake Ferrari's annual output of 3500 in three or four years. \"If we are to remain successful, increase sales and generate revenue which will make us self-sufficient it is now crucial that we invest in a third product line,'' said Ulrich Bez, the chief executive.</p> <p> The DB7 retails at around \u00a390,000 and the new model, if Straford-on-Avon district council gives planning permission for the Gaydon expansion, will cost between \u00a360,000 and \u00a390,000. It will be on sale within four years. Aston Martin, which employs 600, said its assembly lines were too small for the new car; 90% of its output is sold in the UK, US and Europe, with the remaining 10% being sold in the Far East.</p>",
  "Flying by plane produces more greenhouse gases for every kilometre each passenger travels than other forms of transport. Total emissions from aviation are small in comparison to those from private cars or power stations, but they are growing. As Ben Rogers complained on these pages on Monday, as well as carbon dioxide, planes emit nitrogen oxides, which may also be contributing to climate change. Even the water vapour trails that cut across our skies are, at that altitude, a greenhouse gas. <p>UN scientists recommend greenhouse gas emissions need to be cut by at least 60% in the next 50 years in order to prevent dangerous climate change. But fuel used for aviation is exempt by international treaty from any form of tax. There are no regulations on efficiency of aircraft engines. Although there have been improvements in their fuel efficiency, these have been outstripped by growth in demand for air travel. Emissions from international flights are not even subject to the Kyoto protocol, which set legally binding targets for developed countries to cut greenhouse gases.</p> <p>The climate, so to speak, is changing. The International Civil Aviation Organisation is due to report to the UN framework convention on climate change in autumn next year. The European Parliament is backing proposals for a charge on aviation emissions and the UK government is to set out its thoughts in a white paper within the next couple of years. So far, the airlines have offered voluntary improvements. The government will need to be wary. It is still thrashing out agreements with industrial firms wanting reductions in their obligations under the climate change levy. These were supposed to be finalised over a year ago. Besides, such voluntary initiatives suffer from lack of transparency. They cannot be enforced and create no incentives for companies to strive for improvements beyond the minimum. </p> <p>The solution, Ben Rogers argued, has to be punitive taxes. There are precedents: most other forms of transport routinely pay either charges or taxes that take their pollution into account. What would the Automobile Association give for a version of the treaties that protect aviation from fuel taxation? In 1996, the Tory environment secretary, John Gummer, backed calls for a global aviation fuel tax to tackle climate change. This remains official policy. But there are problems. Such a tax would require international agreement, not just on the principle but on the mechanism by which such a tax could be put into effect and on the use to which any revenues were put. Given the sort of rows we have in the EU about allowing Brussels to exercise fiscal powers, it seems unlikely an aviation tax would ever be feasible worldwide. </p> <p>A much better prospect is emissions-trading, for which the Kyoto protocol did create a legal framework. The concept is as follows. Countries or industries are allocated a certain number of permits to emit (pollute). The total number of permits is fixed and declines over a set period. The permits then become a tradeable commodity, so if it is cheaper to reduce emissions in a part of the economy other than their own, companies can buy permits from there. The price of permits should reflect the lowest cost of delivering cuts in emissions across all those involved. The aim is to give governments maximum certainty over total emissions and give business maximum flexibility in delivering the reductions.</p> <p>Carbon dioxide emissions from international flights are so far not controlled by Kyoto, so as things stand could not participate in emissions trading. Domestic flying could. Emissions from a flight from, say, London to Edinburgh are part of the UK's total allocation of emissions, which are subject to the legally binding reduction target. Emissions from a flight between London and New York do not count in either UK or American totals. This anomaly has to be addressed. If international aviation were included in the Kyoto totals, it would be subject to a 5% reduction from 1990 levels by between 2008 and 2012.</p> <p>Of course, such an allocation to international aviation would almost certainly not cover requirements if the projections for passenger growth are to be believed. This is where trading comes in. If the airlines wanted to emit more than their allocated permits allowed, extra would have to be purchased from elsewhere. The airlines (and therefore air passengers) would collectively pay for emissions-reduction somewhere else in the world to compensate for those created by flying. This would implement the polluter-pays principle in such a way that those responsible for pollution paid only the lowest reasonable price. Getting agreement along these lines would take time but would be easier than attempting to legislate a global aviation tax. The UK could even lead the way by including domestic aviation in its own emissions-trading scheme, which is now under construction. To avoid unfair treatment, airlines that accepted fixed permit allocations and participated in emissions-trading could be exempted from air passenger duty for domestic flights.</p> <p>All sectors will have to do their bit to ameliorate climate change - including the airlines that fly between nations and the passengers who use them.</p> <p>Chris Hewett is at the Institute for Public Policy Research.

  "<p>Toyota's decision to ask new UK suppliers to bill it in euros rather than sterling does have a commercial rationale - although one which appears to have dawned on the Japanese car maker rather late in the day. It is understandable that, as a big exporter to euroland, the company wants to bring its cost base as closely into line with its competitors as possible. A 16% depreciation in the euro's value against the pound over the past 18 months is certainly no help. </p> <p>But while the Toyota move would have been a smart one last year today the decision only really makes sense if Toyota believes the euro is going to continue falling against sterling - and that, to be frank, seems unlikely. Asking suppliers to invoice in euros is not the same as fixing the exchange rate. When the euro recovers, as it almost certainly will, Toyota will fall victim to the exchange rate risk it thought it was passing on to suppliers.</p> <p>The significance of the announcement goes beyond the way in which a multi-national asks to be invoiced by its sub-contractors. It says quite a bit about the way in which the big and powerful can shift commercial risks on to the vulnerable. It speaks volumes about the way in which firms in certain industries are being forced to find cost savings as a result of global over-production, and it feeds straight into the dialogue of the deaf going on about Britain's membership of the single currency. </p> <p>At one level, Toyota's move will certainly have an impact on the debate. Just as British consumers may warm to the single currency once they start to handle euro notes and coins in Spain and France, so there may be a drip-drip effect on companies as well. There is a risk that parts of the UK economy may move towards becoming de facto members of the single currency zone even if the rest of the country stays out. So far any evidence of that happening is sketchy. Over the longer term there are firms which may find it more convenient, because of the profile of their business, to deal in euros. It will be interesting to see, too, how London-based cross-border share dealing settles down, if the merger with Frankfurt ever gets off the ground. </p> <p>Will the pound or the euro be the currency of choice? Initially it will be the former, but for how long? That is for the future, however. To draw the conclusion that Britain should join the euro simply because life at present is uncomfortable for a relatively small number of Japanese investors would be a mistake. Toyota, Nissan, and some other big names would definitely benefit from a fixed exchange rate with the euro, provided it was lower than today's, but every firm in Britain would suffer if the UK economy was labouring under the wrong interest rate. </p> <p>Economically, what matters is that Britain has the right overall business climate. Japan accounts for only 4% of inward investment and it has been noticeable that American companies - a much bigger proportion of the total - and those operating in the hi-tech field put Britain's membership of the single currency well down their list of concerns. Yesterday Ford promised a new Aston Martin R&amp;D centre and Nasdaq-listed RSL said it was moving to Britain. </p> <p>Politically, what matters is that we have a proper exercise in democracy. We should not allow a decision as big as this to be made by a few multinationals. Even those who support British entry into the euro should be concerned about the impact on voters if the perception takes hold that Britain is being bounced into membership by big firms with their own, narrow, economic agenda. </p> <p><strong>Market share</strong></p> <p> \"If investors see a stock's price change dramatically but are given access to critical market-moving information only much later, we risk nothing less than the public's faith and confidence in America's capital markets.\" That was US securities and exchange commission chairman Arthur Levitt yesterday on the decision to give small shareholders the same access to price-sensitive information as big shareholders and analysts. The decision will not be an easy one for the investment community.</p> <p> Analysts' forecasts of company performance can themselves be market-moving. Will a company which reckons an analyst is getting his or her sums wrong be able to drop a quiet word about a rethink? Journalists, too, might find executives inclined to avoid answering awkward questions by pleading the SEC amendment - whether or not they would be in contravention of the rule change. But although the practicalities may be difficult, they do not constitute an insurmountable obstacle. The SEC will no doubt consider the way in which its new regime is working and make appropriate amendments. But the underlying principle, that all shareholders must be treated equally, must be right. Exchange officials and executives of publicly quoted firms round the world should have Mr Levitt's words framed on their office walls where they can be read, regularly.</p>",
  "Ben Rogers (Comment, August 7) wrongly implies that taxation of aviation fuel will cut demand for air travel, reducing emissions and noise. Aviation, a vital part of modern society, is an efficient and responsible industry and is constantly improving its environmental performance - airlines have doubled their fuel efficiency over the last 30 years and aircraft today are typically 75% quieter. Aviation consumes approximately 12% of the oil supplies used by the entire transport sector; jet aircraft produce 2-3% of global man-made nitrogen oxide emissions and only 2.5% of the carbon dioxide produced by the burning of fossil fuels. Yet, Mr Rogers would have us believe air travel is the most environmentally damaging form of transport. Solutions to the environmental challenges of increasing demand for air travel will be found in a combination of new technology and better management of operations, both in the air and on the ground. Simple demand management through taxation will not bring the relief sought by Mr Rogers. <br> <b>John McClarty</b> <br> Society of British Aerospace Companies <p>\u0095 Full marks to John Prescott for further travel concessions (Pensioners to get cheap bus travel, August 9).

  "The world of international scholarship knows the anthropologist Adrian Adams principally through her three remarkable books on Senegal, where she has died, aged 54, in a road accident. Each one is written with grace, lucidity, and power. <p>Le Long Voyage Des Gens Du Fleuve (1977) sets the causes and consequences of labour migration in a historical context; La Terre Et Les Gens Du Fleuve (1985) centres on the life and labour of those whom the migrants temporarily left behind - and includes a marvellously detailed reconstruction of the agricultural history of Kounghani, a Soninke village on the banks of the upper Senegal river. Much of the substance of the latter volume is translated, incorporated and greatly developed in A Claim To Land By The River: A Household In Senegal, 1720-1994 (1996), with Adrian's husband Jaab\u00e9. So identified as co-author.</p> <p>Adrian had come to rely on the wisdom and experience of Jaab\u00e9, who came from Kounghani and, since 1939, had travelled the world as a seaman. He had always been alert for practical or technical advice relevant to the needs of peasant farmers in his Sahelian homeland. In 1978, he and Adrian married and made their home in the Kounghani family compound. It was 21 years ago that Adrian abandoned academic life to undertake that deeper commitment to the African community which she had recently begun to study. </p> <p>She was born in New York, the daughter of an American foreign service officer, Charles Adams, and his wife, Florence. After university study in Dakar, where her father was working, Aix-en-Provence and the London School of Economics, Adrian became a lecturer in social anthropology at Aberdeen University. Her doctoral thesis was on the thought of Claud Levi-Strauss, but her research increasingly centred on the human problems of Senegalese workers in France - which led her to Jaab\u00e9.</p> <p>But to remember Adams only for her scholarship would be a betrayal. Since 1978, she unreservedly engaged herself in the life and struggles of Kounghani. Her parting challenge to international Africanists, in 1979, was her Open Letter in African Affairs, which became a key text for those sceptical about the prevailing wisdom of technological development. In Kounghani, she gave unstinting support to her husband's efforts to organise co-operatives to represent the interests of peasant farmers. This involved resisting attempts by the Senegalese state, encouraged by the International Monetary Fund and other international agencies, to oblige rural communities to abandon strategies of subsistence - well adapted to a precarious environment - in favour of commercial agriculture, carrying high burdens of debt and a perilous dependence for water on the management of high dams.</p> <p>Slowly, Jaab\u00e9's experience, refined and expressed by Adrian's intellect, began to penetrate official thinking in Senegal and abroad. When, last January, she promoted their case to the World Commission on Dams, in Cairo, she could, at last, feel encouraged by its reception. Research and advocacy were only part of Adrian's active life within the family compound, where she was increasingly able to make use of modern information technology. </p> <p>Convinced of the importance of language, she devoted much creative energy to producing basic literacy programmes in the Soninke language. She helped to improve basic health services in the village and cultivated her vegetable garden. Latterly, she assumed parental responsibility for Jaab\u00e9's young grandson, Ibu. </p> <p>Her death is as cruel for her Kounghani family as it is for her mother, sister Christine, and brothers Charles and Kenneth.</p> <p><b>Adrian Adams, anthropologist and campaigner, born November 30 1945; died August 2, 2000 </b></p>",
  "<p>Vera Chytilova enjoys a thumping good argument. So when she and her film crew were detained last week by German police on suspicion of paedophilia, she almost burst a blood vessel. The first lady of Czech cinema was on the Baltic coast, shooting a sequence for her new film, Chased from Paradise. Based on Desmond Morris's The Naked Ape and set on a nudist beach, there is a scene in which a young girl cavorts naked in the waves. Chytilova had drafted in her school-age granddaughter for the part. </p> <p>\"It's about the relationship between those who wear clothes and those who don't,\" she tells me. But the Germans' \"panty police\" who patrol the beaches failed to appreciate the distinction. Alerted by a fisherman, they arrested Chytilova, a cameraman and a technician. \"Paedophilia was suspected because German laws forbid filming of children on the beach,\" a police spokesman explained. \"They spoilt our opportunity to make use of the last rays of sun,\" Chytilova ranted on her release, before retreating to a secret location in south Bohemia to finish the film. </p> <p>She is the first to admit to being a control freak who recently attempted to direct her own death scene. At home and feeling under the weather, she became convinced her hours were numbered. \"I found the idea rather disagreeable that the moment after my death, I would lose total control of what happened, and someone would have to find my remains.\" As it turned out, she was just suffering from wind, but the experience was humbling. </p> <p>The scene could have come straight from one of the 71-year-old Chytilova's films: choppily and hastily edited, with lashings of grotesque humour, and imbued with the nervous vigour of their director. </p> <p>The red-haired grand dame, who made a name for herself as a leading representative of the 60s new wave, has just received an award for her outstanding contribution to world cinematography at the 35th Karlovy Vary film festival. </p> <p>\"Frankly, I'd rather have cash than laurels,\" she sniffs, before adding hastily, \"but it's certainly one in the eye for all the negative critics out there.\" </p> <p>Which calls to mind her 1966 film, Daisies. Decried by some as gibberish, hailed by others as refreshingly uncompromising and radical, it highlighted surreal aspects of the Czech new wave and cemented her reputation alongside Milos Forman and Jiri Menzel as a pioneer and as one of a generation who made a huge impact on world cinema. </p> <p>But while Forman made it to the west after the positive reception of A Blonde in Love and The Firemen's Ball (and would go on to win Oscars for One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and Amadeus), and Menzel's 1967 Oscar for Closely Observed Trains earned him a name that stretched far beyond the borders of communist Czechoslovakia, what happened to Vera Chytilova's career? </p> <p>Choleric, diabolically crazy, aggressive, ironic, sarcastic, inflexible and arrogant - just a few of the phrases used by the Czech media to describe her after she collected her prize. Some who know her say these characteristics stem from a bitterness she shares with others of her generation, who spent the best years of their lives working under a totalitarian regime. </p> <p>She describes herself as an \"overheated kettle that you can't turn down\", but puts it down to impatience. \"You always have to work as if what you're working on could be your last,\" she says. \"I want to move on, even if I have to crawl.\" Chytilova cultivates the art of being deliberately ruthless. \"I have no desire to cuddle my audience,\" she emphatically states. </p> <p>Tainted Horseplay, from 1988, was one of the first films about Aids. It portrays the lives of a group of party-loving actors who engage in promiscuous sex to make up for their lack of professional satisfaction. The jollity ends when two discover they are suffering from the virus. </p> <p>Her most recent film, the very black comedy Traps, was celebrated by a handful of hardcore feminists, but regarded elsewhere as a cruel depiction of post-communist Czech society. In a country whose ex-play wright president, Vaclav Havel, once described women's rights as \"dada and meaningless\", and where feminism is regarded as a problem, Chytilova's radical attitude sits uneasily. \"Everything about her films is on the edge of disintegration. I cannot watch them. There's not a shred of consolation,\" says a feminist sociologist from Prague's Charles University, who preferred not to be named. </p> <p>So does Chytilova consider herself a feminist, and if so, how does this affect her film-making? \"Is your newspaper a serious one?\" She peers over her large sunglasses. \"You ask pointless and primitive questions.\" </p> <p>Her steam rising, she explains that she does not believe in feminism per se, but in individualism. \"If there's something you don't like, don't keep to the rules - break them. I'm an enemy of stupidity and simple-mindedness in both men and women and I have rid my living space of these traits.\" </p> <p>Her abrasive manner has earned her the moniker the Margaret Thatcher of Czech film, and she appears quite flattered by the comparison - though she swiftly adds that they have nothing in common politically. \"People are generally weak, cautious and frightened of being embarrassed, whereas I'm merciless and impertinent.\" </p> <p>Film-making with Chytilova is by all accounts a harrowing experience. She shouts and screams, and gleefully admits to beating up her cameramen when they prove unwilling to try out new ideas. </p> <p>She is currently trying to raise funding for Chased from Paradise, but after the nudist beach location problem, she is having trouble drumming up sponsorship, even among the sexually liberated Czechs. </p> <p>\"Hollywood demands that its viewers have a clear idea of time and environment, and Chytilova makes films with unpeeled layers - which meant she couldn't be attacked by the communists. But she still uses that protection now,\" says fellow Czech Sasa Gedeon, a 29-year-old director acclaimed for his 1999 film, Return of the Idiot. But Alice Nellis, who this year won international awards for her humanist film Eenie Meeny, adds: \"She's bonkers, that's clear, but I really appreciate her ability to grasp what's around and to find great metaphors for social issues.\" </p> <p>Chytilova has no regrets that she declined invitations in the 60s, shortly before the Prague Spring, to move westwards. She chuckles, though, at a recent request from a French film-maker who wished to remake one of her communist-era films. \"So the Americans are remaking French films, and the French are remaking Czech films. Slowly, slowly, I will reach America after all.\"</p>",
  "<p>As fish numbers drop, we are being forced to confront a previously held notion, that the seas would endlessly replenish themselves with fish, and that man's feeding would not have any long-term effects on populations. </p> <p>19th Century naturalist Jean Baptiste de Lamarck demonstrated this optimistic perception of the limitlessness of the seas when he argued that \"animals living in the sea waters are protected from the destruction of their species by man. Their multiplication is so rapid and their means of evading pursuit or traps are so great, that there is no likelihood of his being able to destroy the entire species of any of these animals.\" </p> <p>It was in 1995 that signs of the depletion of global fish stocks became impossible to ignore. In an article published in the New Scientist that year, director of the National Audubon Society's Living Oceans program Carl Safina argued that the crisis in fish stocks had been caused by a \"fundamental folly\": a failure to perceive that fish are wildlife, \"the only wildlife still hunted on a major scale.\" Wild fish, he continued, \"regenerate at rates determined by nature\", so fishing under market dictates must \"eventually run into limits\". </p> <p>At the same time, the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) concluded that the current level of functioning of the world's fisheries could not be sustained; and the National Academy of Sciences in the US reported that human actions had caused discernible changes in the composition and abundance of edible marine life, changes sufficiently significant to endanger marine ecosystems. </p> <p>Diminishing Returns: Exploiting the Ocean's Bounty, Michael Parfit's article in the November 1995 issue of National Geographic, highlighted the fact that fishing was failing despite all technological advances, because the fish were no longer there. The \"wealth of the oceans, once deemed inexhaustible, has proven finite,\" he wrote, adding that fish, once dubbed 'the poor man's protein', had become \"a resource coveted - and fought over - by nations.\"</p> <p>This situation is the result of the modern fishing boom, which lasted about 50 years. Improvements in radar technology allowed boats to fish in fog. Long-range navigation equipment meant that vessels could locate specific areas of the ocean to within 50 feet, and sonar opened up the deepest recesses of the sea darkness. By the 1970s half a million fishing vessels were moving through the seas around the world, tracking and catching fish. Now the figure is over a million. Nearly half the world's oceans are now \"claimed\" by fishing nations and organisations. Pressure on fishing populations has increased dramatically year after year; now 80 to 90% of some populations of fish are removed each year. </p> <p>In just half a century of intensive fishing, we have seriously altered and endangered many of the world's wild fish stocks. At the point where wild fish stocks have dwindled, technology has come up with the solution again: aquaculture, or the cultivation of fish in controlled environments, the genetic alteration of fish to make them more able to cope with naturally hostile environments, the feeding of fish with non-fish foodstuffs. </p> <p>Aquaculture has more than doubled its output in the past decade, an increase of about 10 million metric tonnes. But this increase has not removed the pressure on wild fish stocks. Many wild fish are still being caught for feed; in some instances more wild fish are required for feed than farmed fish produced. Irrespective of the benefits or otherwise of farmed fish, we have been, and continue to be, enormously careless of the perilous balance of marine wildlife populations. </p> <p>In a stark and grueling book called Planetary Overload, A J McMichael (an epidemiologist and population scientist from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine) argued that homo sapiens has existed \"for less than one-thousandth of the time since animal life ventured from the oceans onto the dry land.\" Humans, he suggested, \"are newcomers, with no special immunity against the usual fate of biological species on earth: extinction.\" </p> <p>Our extinction threat, or our \"endangerment\", as a species derives not necessarily from the contamination of local environments with toxic chemicals, or from the outstripping of the Earth's material resources - oil, metals, timber and so forth. Rather, the risk derives \"from the disruption of natural systems because we are exceeding the planet's capacity to absorb, replenish and restore.\" That is, because of our impact on other species populations, we are tampering with various natural systems which are vastly helpful in sustaining life. </p> <p>An estimated 99% of all species that have ever existed on Earth are now extinct. Extinction is, therefore, absolutely the norm. The sort of wild devastation we are wreaking on animal populations surrounding our own can hardly help the chances for survival of either the species coexisting with us for this brief blink of time, or our own. As McMichael argues, \"We humans cannot live apart from nature, remote from the great web of life.\" </p> <p>We have assumed that just because the human need for something is seemingly limitless, supplies would follow. It is this sort of belief in the mysterious regenerative faculties of nature, a sort of rather primitive \"nature awe\", which cannot continue. </p> <p>\u0095 Carl Safina is the author of Song for the Blue Ocean: Encounters Along the World's Coasts and Beneath the Seas.

  "<p><strong>The Common Fisheries Policy</strong></p> <p>The Treaty of Rome provides for a Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). The CFP is made up of four main areas of responsibility covering:<br>\u0095 the conservation of fish resources and the relation between fisheries and the environment, <br>\u0095 common organisation of the markets in fisheries products;<br>\u0095 structural policy, and <br>\u0095 external relations relating to fisheries beyond Community waters. </p> <p>There is a control and monitoring regime to ensure the implementation of regulations. Decisions are taken at Community level and implemented in member states. </p> <p>The first common fisheries measures date from the early 1970s. A comprehensive CFP regime was adopted in January 1983. The aim of the CFP is to secure the future of the EU fisheries sector by ensuring sustainable fisheries. </p> <p>While the number of jobs in this sector represents a low percentage of overall EU employment, their importance must not be underestimated. They sustain, or make a crucial contribution to, the socio-economic welfare of many coastal communities. </p> <p>A review of the CFP is to take place in 2002. </p> <p><strong>Main CFP measures</strong></p> <p>Total allowable catches (TACs) are set annually by the Council of Fisheries Ministers for the main commercial stocks. The Commission bases its proposals regarding TACs on scientific advice. A range of technical measures are in place to increase the selectivity of fishing gear to prevent catches of immature fish and to allow those that have been caught to escape. These fish must be allowed to stay in the sea to reproduce and thereby replenish stocks. Minimum landing sizes discourage the targeting of juvenile fish. Closed areas are established to protect spawning or juvenile fish. </p> <p>Despite the measures taken, the fishing capacity of the Community fleets remains too large for the available fish resources. More effective measures must be found to tackle the problems caused by overcapacity. Traditional means of control are being strengthened by the use of satellite systems to monitor fishing vessels. New market measures will ensure fisheries products can be traced from the net to the plate. <br> <br> <strong>Stock depletion: the case of cod</strong></p> <p>According to the criteria defined by the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas (ICES), cod is too heavily fished and the quantities of mature cod in the sea are at a worryingly low level. Depletion of cod stocks affects not only the European Union but most other fishing industries in the North-Atlantic. </p> <p>Within the North Sea, scientific assessments had indicated some apparent improvement in the situation. Fishing pressure appeared to have gone down and the quantities of mature fish to have gone up, although fishing pressure was still too high and the level of mature cod still too low. Scientists are, however, still unsure that this analysis was a true reflection of the state of the stocks. The next assessment is due in November. </p> <p>Cod in the west of Scotland is by no means in good shape, but it is in a better state than in the Irish Sea where the stock is extremely depleted. At its December 1999 meeting, the Council of Fisheries Ministers decided on a very low level of total allowable catches for this stock for this year.</p> <p>Other, but not all, fish stocks are diminishing. Overfishing, which has created such problems for cod, is also affecting other demersal stocks (fish which live close to the bottom of the sea). </p> <p><strong>What remedies are there?</strong></p> <p>There is no \"miracle cure\" for the current problems of fisheries management. The main problem comes from the fact that existing management measures do not go far enough. Too often, Commission proposals have been watered down or delayed by the Council of Ministers. </p> <p>One example is the current multi-annual guidance programme for the EU fishing fleets (MAGP IV), used to reduce fishing pressure. MAGP IV has not been sufficiently effective in cutting fishing capacity and effort to sustainable levels. Both the required cuts and the means of achieving them simply have not gone far enough towards tackling the perverse effects of existing overcapacity and advances in fishing technology. Strengthening existing measures would go a long way to tackling overfishing. <br> <br>A recovery plan for the Irish Sea cod stock was set up earlier this year. This included a closed area for a 10-week period to protect spawning fish. Additional measures regulating fishing gear in this area will soon become mandatory. Of particular interest in this case is the involvement of the fishermen concerned in taking these measures.</p> <p><strong>Aquaculture</strong></p> <p>Aquaculture is an important part of the CFP. Aquaculture represents some 15% of the volume and 25% of the value of the total production of fisheries products in the European Union. </p> <p>The outlook for aquaculture is still promising. However, much of the sector's continued success depends on reaching and maintaining a delicate balance between production and demand, aquaculture development and protection of the environment, quality and safety of products and reasonable prices. </p> <p>Community legislation sets out the conditions for the development of aquaculture projects in relation to their impact on the environment. Food safety is a Community priority. Levels of dioxin in food, including fish and animal feedstuffs, are currently being addressed. The White Paper on Food Safety, published in January 2000, indicates that proposals for Community legislation on the levels of dioxin must be adopted by the Commission by December 2000. This legislation is likely to embrace all fisheries products on the basis of the evaluation of risks being currently undertaken by two scientific Committees. In addition, new health rules are being proposed for the animal by-products sector, strengthening rules on control and traceability. </p> <p>Alternative sources of fish feedstuffs are being considered. Maintaining the same health benefits as those of current feedstuffs limits the alternatives that can be used. Plankton, eaten by fish, produce beneficial Omega 3 oil which is not found in land products, for example. </p> <p><strong>Securing the future of the fisheries sector</strong></p> <p>The Commission will publish a Green Paper at the beginning of next year to set out the options for the future of the Common fisheries policy and the possible amendments to Community law. The Agriculture, Rural Development and Fisheries Commissioner, Franz Fischler, has identified five areas in which improvements to the CFP should be considered. These are: the conservation of resources; the CFP's economic and social dimension; external fisheries relations; the Mediterranean; and good governance in fisheries policy through the involvement of those concerned. </p> <p>\u0095 For further information on EU policy, go to the Directorate General for Fisheries <a href=\"http://europa.eu.int/comm/dg14/dg14.html\">website</a>.</p>",
  "<b>What is the problem?</b> <br> The problem is that, based on figures from the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), 70% of the world's fish stocks are now either fully exploited, overfished, depleted, or rebuilding from previous over-fishing. Marine pollution has also adversely affected fish populations. As a result world catches have plateaued since their peak in 1989, when 85 to 95m tonnes of fish were harvested. It seems unlikely they will start rising again until concerted efforts have been made at national and international levels to allow stocks to recover and then to fish them in a sustainable way. <p><b>Is this afflicting all countries equally?</b><br> Of the world's 15 major marine fishing regions, the productivity in all but two has fallen. With a history of intensive fishing, the Atlantic fisheries have experienced the biggest declines: fisheries in the Northwest Atlantic, the Southeast Atlantic and the Eastern Central Atlantic reached their maximum production levels 10 or 20 years ago, and catches have been declining since. In other Atlantic areas, the Mediterranean and parts of the Pacific, annual catches are in more gradual decline, having reached maximum levels a few years ago. The only areas in which the FAO is projecting possible increases are in the Eastern and Western Indian Ocean and areas of the Pacific. These areas have not been as severely overfished as elsewhere on the globe. However, these are also the oceans for which estimates and stock assessments are least reliable, so any optimistic projections may be based on uncertain information. </p> <p><b>What can be done?</b><br> The FAO estimates that if stocks were allowed to recover and were then managed responsibly, about 100m tonnes (an increase of roughly 15m tonnes on current figures) could be caught globally. More careful managing of bycatch (fish which no one meant to catch being dragged along into the net) and discards (fish no one wants being thrown back into the sea, usually dead) would reduce the number of fish mortalities which never even get packed into a supermarket freezer. Some scientists also argue the solution could be aquaculture, though there are also fears that aquaculture will create more problems than it will solve. </p> <p><b>What exactly is aquaculture?</b><br> Aquaculture is the pseudo-scientific term for fish farming, ie cultivating fish in controlled conditions, rather than catching whatever swims in the sea. There are various sorts of aquaculture, representing different levels of intervention in the lifecycles of fish. There is intensive fish farming, where all the nutrition for the fish is provided. There is semi-intensive fish farming, meaning the food supply for the fish is enhanced. There is extensive fish farming, where predators and competitors are removed. Globally at present, aquaculture is divided into two main types: commercial farms and family or cooperative farms. Commercial farms combine intensive and semi-intensive methods to produce high-valued fish for domestic consumption or export, while family and cooperative farms rely on extensive and semi-intensive practices to produce low-value fish for local markets. Aquaculture provided 20% of global fisheries production in 1996. Of that percentage, over half of aquaculture production came from freshwater. The remaining portion was made up mainly of aquaculture production in marine environments, with a small fraction in brackish water.</p> <p><b>From where do farmers get food for their fish?</b><br> Much fish farming relies heavily on fish feed, that is, capturing small fish like mackerel and anchovy and feeding them to carnivorous farmed fish. In the production of the ten most commonly farmed fish, roughly 2kg of wild fish feed are required for every kilogram of farmed fish produced. This means that at the moment fish feed is further draining wild fish stocks, without even producing an equivalent mass of farmed fish. There are proposals to use soy oils instead of fish oils and, worryingly, animal byproducts (such as blood meal and bone meal). </p> <p><b>Who is doing it?</b><br> Generally, most aquaculture happens in what the UN defines as low-income, food-deficit countries. 90% of global aquaculture occurs in Asia. China is responsible for more than two-thirds of the total. Europe, North America and Japan collectively produce slightly more than 10% of global aquaculture output, but these countries consume most of the farmed seafood produced internationally. </p> <p> <b>So fish are farmed in China and eaten in Henley-on-Thames?</b><br> It depends on the sort of fish. Some fish can command higher prices because they are perceived to be tastier and more stylish, eg salmon and shrimp. This means that Asian fish farmers are tending to produce high-worth fish for export, while producing lower-value fish like carp for consumption by a poorer domestic market. </p> <p><b>So fish farmers could create hundreds of new fish and leave all the oceans free? </b><br> Some would agree. The FAO has optimistically suggested that scientific improvements in aquaculture, leading to the creation of genetically more successful fish, might be the solution to the stagnation in ocean fish stocks. A recent report in Nature (29 June 2000) suggested that aquaculture can reduce pressure on wild fisheries. For example, by increasing the production of farmed fish (ie shrimp, salmon and molluscs) - which compete commercially with wild fish - aquaculture reduces global fish prices. This could eventually reduce the commercial viability of ocean fishing, and persuade investors to reallocate funds. Other farmed fish, such as tilapia, milkfish and channel catfish, offer alternatives to overfished ocean fish such as cod, hake, haddock and pollock. </p> <p> <b>Tilapia and chips for supper, then?</b><br> The problem is that consumers frequently fail to change their tastes as quickly as fish farmers might like them to. Instead, they tend to want to continue buying cod and haddock rather than, or as well as, tilapia and milkfish, and therefore pressure on wild stocks isn't reduced at all. Wild fisheries are also highly subsidized: government subsidies approach 20-25% of global gross revenue. </p> <p><b>And what do environmentalists say?</b><br> Fish farming, although in theory adding more fish to world supplies, in fact risks further reducing wild fish stocks - through habitat destruction, changes in food web interactions, the introduction of exotic species into wild populations, the spreading of diseases from farmed to wild fish, and nutrient pollution. Farming, particularly of shrimp, has meant thousands of hectares of mangroves and coastal wetlands have been converted into shrimp and milkfish ponds. It's also difficult to persuade farmed fish to keep to their pens. Nearly half of the salmon caught by North Atlantic fishermen are of farmed origin. Farmed fish may spawn with wild fish and dilute the genetic makeup of their offspring, making them less well-adapted to their environment than their original wild parents. Diseases may also spread from farmed to wild fish. Whitespot and yellowhead viruses have caused massive losses in farmed fish in Asia. Untreated effluent containing uneaten fish feed and fish faeces may pass from fish farm areas, modifying the biogeochemical makeup of coastal waters. </p> <p><b>In conclusion? </b><br> There's a global stagnation in wild fish stocks. This has been caused by marine pollution and overfishing. It would seem necessary to reduce the pressure on ocean stocks. Aquaculture could be a way of doing that. However, without tighter controls on fish feed, escapes from fish farms and modification of habitat, aquaculture will merely worsen the global depletion of fish stocks, and could adversely affect food chains and gene pools. </p> <p>\u0095 Additional information courtesy of Euan Dunn of the RSPB.</p>",
  "<p>After years of mismanagement and inadequate protection, the UK's delicate and diverse marine ecosystem is facing an environmental crisis. </p> <p>To help revitalise our sea life - arguably the most neglected area of the UK's heritage - WWF, the global environment network, has launched the Oceans Recovery Campaign (ORCA). The campaign will highlight the multiple threats facing our marine wildlife, habitats and fishing industry, and will lobby for greater protection of the seas around the UK. </p> <p>WWF recognises there is no single solution to the plight of our seas. It is pointless managing commercial fish stocks properly if we continue to poison our seas or destroy spawning and nursery grounds. Likewise it is useless to protect sites if a transient oil tanker subsequently runs aground spilling thousands of tons of crude oil. </p> <p>We need an eco-system approach to the management of UK seas and coastlines. This approach requires not only the management and protection of species and habitats, but also of the many activities that take place - research, exploitation of resources, transport, waste disposal, offshore development, recreation and tourism. Two of the principal structures which would assist this ecological management of our coastlines and oceans would be a network of Marine Protected Areas and Fishing-Free Zones.</p> <p>The launch of ORCA took as its focus the fact that cod faces commercial extinction in UK waters. Our traditional dish of fish 'n' chips is threatened. Little of the cod now eaten in the UK comes from UK waters. In the Irish Sea, for example, cod is at an historic low. This year's quota is 80% lower than in 1999 yet fishermen have been unable to meet it. In addition the amount of young cod, haddock and plaice produced by North Sea stocks has fallen by up to 60% over the past 40 years and the number of UK fishermen has more than halved since 1948, dropping by 20% in the last decade alone. Other marine species under threat include skate and the harbour porpoise.</p> <p>Sarah Jones, WWF's fisheries expert, says: \"This isn't just a threat to ocean wildlife, it's a threat to our cultural heritage. WWF will work with the fishing industry to help resurrect our battered fish stocks through a range of solutions, including piloting Fishing-Free Zones. The fishing industry and environmentalists share the same vision - abundant fish stocks in healthy seas.\"</p> <p>Among the several potential solutions for sustainable fisheries management are Fishing-Free Zones - meaning areas closed to fishing. These have proved very successful in restoring fish stocks in other areas of the world, including Canada and New Zealand. If fish are left undisturbed, their populations increase quickly. Fishing-Free Zones are also relatively easy to enforce. By using satellite tracking, for example, we can throw a virtual \"fence\" around any area. </p> <p>Already fishermen in the south-west of England, supported by WWF, are promoting a Fishing-Free Zone scheme. Government support is needed to enable the fishing industry to go further. WWF is also calling for reform of the Common Fisheries Policy to improve management of fish stocks. The UK is one of the few countries in the world that recognises the need to manage fish stocks responsibly. </p> <p>Up to half of all the UK's wildlife - some 40,000 species - is found in our seas, including dolphins, whales, turtles, seals, corals and sea horses. To help protect this important variety of wildlife, WWF's ORCA campaign is calling for a significant increase in the number of Marine Protected Areas to cover at least 10% of our seas.</p> <p>A Marine Protected Area is similar to a nature reserve on land. It provides food, shelter and breeding and nursery grounds for marine wildlife, greater protection for a range of species and habitats, and better protection from the impacts of oil pollution, shipping, and drilling for oil and gas. The proposed network of protected areas will cover coldwater coral reefs, seagrass meadows, kelp forests and other underwater habitats. Activities occurring within the areas will have to be in harmony with nature. The network will protect against threats such as dumping of waste, mineral extraction, oil spills and noise disturbance to whales and dolphins.</p> <p>At present there are hundreds of separate but often conflicting laws and policies relating to the marine environment. So, in the longer term, WWF is pushing for the introduction of a UK Oceans Act to provide integrated legislative support for the protection of the marine environment for the benefit of wildlife and people.</p> <p>As part of the ORCA campaign, No 10 Downing Street has pledged to accept its first ever internet petition.
