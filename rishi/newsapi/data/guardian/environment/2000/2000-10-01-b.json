  "<p> 'Be sure to tell me when the romantic bit starts,' said my wife. 'I wouldn't want to miss that.' In the tiny swaying room, she struggled into her tartan pyjamas, and climbed the stepladder to her bunk, banging her head on the ceiling. The light went off, leaving the cabin in darkness save for the rhythmic sweep of orange street lamps. Outside the window, a wet Friday night in Watford slipped by. </p> <p>We were on a sleeper train to Fort William. It was our first wedding anniversary, and this long weekend was meant to provide the perfect backdrop: a romantic train journey; a glorious drive through the Highlands; and two nights on beautiful, mountainous, desolate Skye. Eight hours later, I sat on my bunk gazing out of the window through a grey dawn at a brooding loch and snow-capped peaks beyond. 'Wake up,' I whispered to my wife. 'The romantic bit has started.' At Fort William, we picked up a hire car and drove 80 miles to Kyle of Lochalsh, the mainland gateway to The Misty Isle. The opening of the Skye Road Bridge in 1995 has made Skye the most accessible of the Hebridean islands. Five minutes and \u00a34.70 later we were heading across Skye's southern flatlands towards the sawtooth profile of the Cuillin, the island's famous mountain range. The weather here is mercurial. One minute, a mackerel sky casts a benign, ethereal glow, warming the ochre heather that carpets the lower slopes. The next a swath of angry mist blacks out the sun and cuts the tops off the mountains, leaving the jagged slopes of hard gabbro in cold silhouette. </p> <p>The road threaded and twisted its way gingerly through the stunning landscape of volcanic rock and sea lochs, every turn revealing immense and majestic panoramas. With a population of 9,000 occupying 535 square miles, Skye can fairly be placed in the wilderness bracket. After 90 minutes, we had almost reached the northwest extremity of the island. The main road ended at Dunvegan, and we took a single track for a further five miles along the lonely banks of Loch Dunvegan. Then we spotted The Three Chimneys restaurant - an appropriate name for a journey that began with a train (maybe only fans of E. Nesbit will appreciate this). Since moving to the crofter's cottage at Colbost from Croydon 15 years ago, Shirley and Eddie Spear have built a worldwide reputation for fine food and wine. The remote restaurant has won many gastronomic awards culminating in 1998 with the prestigious Macallan Scottish Restaurant of the Year Award. </p> <p>That night in the low-beamed restaurant, with roaring fire and flickering candlelight, we were offered a selection of Shirley's delicious home-made breads: Parmesan, sesame and sunflower, or lemon and cardamom. For the main course her legendary Skye crab risotto, and the fillet of Highland beef in Madeira sauce on a sage potato cake were to die for. One food critic wrote that the restaurant should be on everybody's list of things to do before they expire. The man on the next table looked fit to explode as he went for his second pudding. In 1999, the Spears thoughtfully opened six huge and stunningly designed rooms adjoining the restaurant, so that visitors could stagger under the weight of a swollen stomach the 30 yards to bed. That night, drifting off to the sound of the brook running past our window, and feeling the salty breeze coming over the Minch, I fell into the kind of sleep I'd only experienced under general anaesthetic. </p> <p>After breakfast that included smoked salmon, venison, cured ham and oatcakes, we headed around the Duirinish peninsula. At Ramasaig we started a four-hour walk on tracks, soft peat, past the foaming waterfalls of Gleann a' Phuill and An Dubh Loch, and through the deserted crofting village of Lorgill, whose people were shipped to Nova Scotia after the Highland Clearances of the mid-nineteenth century. We picked our way over volcanic rocks and climbed a steep, grassy slope speckled with primroses, then looked down at the kelp forests dancing in the pellucid water of Lorgill Bay. We carried on along seriously vertiginous cliffs with views across the glassy Sea of the Hebrides to North and South Uist. Looking inland, the skyline was dominated by the two giant mesas known as MacLeod's Tables, and further south the giant, snowy, imperious Cuillin. Apart from sea eagles, buzzards, the seals and the rabbits, we didn't see another living soul. </p> <p>We drove south to spend our second and final night on Skye at the splendidly romantic Hotel Eilean Iarmain on the Sleat Peninsula. On our balcony, we sipped the hotel's ownT\u00e9 Bheag whisky and watched the dramatic sunset. </p> <p>Three days on this breathtakingly beautiful and spiritual island had a profound effect on us. We talked of moving, of what we could do, of how magnificent our lives might be, of being able to shout at the top of our voices and not be heard. </p> <p>In the morning, we reluctantly drove back across the bridge and stopped at the old ferry landing in Kyle of Lochalsh. As we looked back, the Misty Isle almost disappeared completely in a wall of white, like a wonderful secret. </p> <p><strong>Skye lines</strong></p> <p>Walking: Skye is a paradise for walkers of all abilities and fitness levels.

  "Billy McIntyre steeled himself as best he could. As he reached the entrance to the hospital ward he paused, took a deep breath and somehow managed to drag a smile on to his lined, pale face - as he had done every night for weeks before visiting his daughter. <p>Donna was in her usual position, curled up awkwardly in the worn, green leather reclining chair beside her bed at the end of the ward. The visit last Monday started well enough: father hugging and tickling daughter, while keeping up the smile and a steady stream of upbeat chatter. But the 21 year old's mood changed, and she became agitated and distressed. Then, in a momentary flicker of lucidity that crushed all her dad's mental preparations, she looked straight at him and asked: 'Am I dying?' </p> <p>The straightforward answer is: yes. Donna is far too ill to comprehend her rapidly-deteriorating condition, let alone deal with its inevitable conclusion, so her father laughed off the question. But three weeks ago she was diagnosed as one of the latest cases of new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), the fatal brain disorder which is the human form of BSE, or mad cow disease. She is unlikely to survive much beyond next spring. </p> <p>McIntyre, an electrician from Aberdeen, has now taken the unusual decision to speak publicly about his daughter's plight while she is still alive. While the bereaved relatives of some victims have provided a glimpse of vCJD's impact, Donna's story provides a sobering insight into the daily ordeal being endured by the McIntyres and at least eight other families across the UK - a plight caused by the scandal of farmers feeding cattle with the brains and vertebrae of other animals, and the repeated disgrace of Ministers and civil servants' failure to stop it. </p> <p>'I still don't believe this is happening to us,' McIntyre told The Observer . 'This is something that affects people on television and in the newspapers, not my daughter. Every day, I try to imagine how I would feel if it was me, to imagine how it must be for her, but it tears me apart just to think about it.' </p> <p>His intervention comes as the mad cow disease scandal returns to centre stage. This week Lord Phillips, chairman of the public inquiry into BSE, will hand his long-awaited final report to Ministers. After two-and-a-half years and more than \u00a316 million, the 16- volume report will be the definitive judgment on the causes of the BSE/CJD affair and the adequacy of Ministers' response. </p> <p>Although Phillips had already made clear that the findings would not decide the thorny issue of liability, the victims' families had hoped the report would pave the way for the Government to set up a compensation scheme. But last week a leaked Whitehall memo revealed that Ministers have decided not to take any blame for the crisis. About \u00a34bn has been spent on a no-fault scheme to compensate farmers for culled cattle, but Ministers, says the memo, baulked at the prospect of a multi-billion pound compensation bill from human victims. </p> <p>When the inquiry began in March 1998, the disease had claimed 24 lives. The toll is now 74. A further eight victims are still alive, according to official figures which do not yet include Donna. </p> <p>For the McIntyres, news of the memo was devastating. Less than a month after they were told that Donna had contracted a disease which should never have been allowed to emerge, they found they also may face a long, painful legal battle for damages. </p> <p>'It is sickening what the politicians have tried to do,' said her father. 'They knew about the problems in the food chain, about spinal cords and other bits of animals getting mixed into cattle feed, but they did nothing. Now they won't take responsibility. </p> <p>'Money is the last thing on our minds now, but I hope Tony Blair chokes on his breakfast when he reads about my daughter.' </p> <p>Donna's life was just coming together when early signs of the disease emerged. She was working as a receptionist in Aberdeen and living in a rented flat there. She was shy, but at weekends she went dancing with friends. Nothing trendy; Donna remains a loyal fan of Take That. Like any young woman, she was meticulous about her appearance. </p> <p>Last Easter, she stayed at her father's small terraced council house. It was the first time they had spent together for three years, and they both loved it. Donna even talkedof giving up her flat and moving back in. She spent the week there. Then she disappeared. </p> <p>For two months the family heard nothing. Telephone calls and letters went unanswered. Her flat was deserted. In July, she should have celebrated her twenty-first birthday. McIntyre and his partner, Bernadette Prescott, sent a card and tried to find her. Nothing. </p> <p>This is classic vCJD behaviour. In the initial stages, victims are unable to comprehend what is happening to their bodies. They merely know that something is going wrong. They become depressed and paranoid, withdrawing into themselves. Some have nightmares. But the McIntyre family could not have known. </p> <p>When Donna eventually resurfaced, the news was not good. She had been sleeping rough and had a serious skin condition and a bizarre twitching in her limbs. </p> <p>Donna began believing that other people were present in the room. She would talk to them. Sometimes she would demand that someone stand up and offer their chair to her brother, Thomas, who died in a fire in 1996. </p> <p>Like many other relatives of vCJD victims, Donna's family started suspecting mental problems. After several visits to her GP, she was referred to psychiatrist. But he was unable to help. </p> <p>By mid-August, Donna's condition was still worse. There were violent mood swings, her speech was slow and badly slurred, and her short-term memory had faded. She was losing the use of her arms and legs, her balance had gone and she needed support to walk. On 28 August, she went into Aberdeen Royal Infirmary for tests. </p> <p>'We had no idea what it could be, although it was obviously serious,' said McIntyre. 'They tested her for multiple sclerosis and diseases like that, but they kept coming up with nothing. We didn't even think about it being vCJD. </p> <p>'Donna was always a meat-eater; she liked her burgers and her pies, but it never crossed our mind that her illness could have had anything to do with that.' </p> <p>A week after Donna was admitted, her father was called to the hospital by his daughter's consultant. The doctor told him the tests had found no alternative, treatable explanation - she was 50 per cent certain Donna had vCJD. Cases cannot be confirmed without analysis of the brain after death but, under rules introduced this year, living probable cases can be diagnosed by the National CJD Surveillance Unit in Edinburgh. Its specialists tested Donna and confirmed the diagnosis. </p> <p>Sitting in his living room surrounded by photographs of Donna and her six brothers and sisters, McIntyre struggled with tears to describe the impact of that: 'My whole body just went numb. I couldn't take it in. I tried to ask questions but I couldn't form any words. Then I broke down. I'm not ashamed of it - I cried like a baby.' </p> <p>Donna's body is now failing fast. She behaves most of the time like a very young child, sitting in her green chair, smiling to herself but unable to follow events around her, or to understand simple questions. As dementia slowly took hold, her short-term memory all but disappeared. Sometimes, she has failed even to recognise her father. Occasionally, some lucidity returns and she becomes more animated and engaged. </p> <p>The physical effects of the disease are obvious, too. Pale and thin, her legs can no longer support her weight, and she is frequently incontinent. Last Friday night, The Observer arrived at the hospital as a guest of her family to find Donna lying, extremely distressed, on the floor beneath her chair. She had realised she needed to use the toilet but her legs had given way and she had fallen over, soiling her pyjamas in her distress. Her brain is so damaged, she is almost certainly unable to tell that her body is deteriorating. </p> <p>Unlike her family. 'Sometimes I have to drag myself up to see her because I am so scared to see what condition she is in,' said her father. 'Then I feel a huge guilt - what we're going through is nothing compared to how she is suffering.' </p> <p>He knows worse is to come. Before long, Donna will lose the power of speech completely. Her eyesight will fade, and she will be unable to swallow. Eventually, she will have to be fed by a tube. Even then, however, death could be months, rather than weeks, away. </p> <p>But McIntyre is determined to see her through to the end with dignity. Against medical advice, he plans to take her home to care for her himself. 'It will be hard, but there will soon be a time when she is no longer there and I don't need to care for her any more. Any time we have is precious.' </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:stuart.millar@theguardian.com\">stuart.millar@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p> Europe 2010. Picture the world's e-commerce desert. The global rust belt. The capital of unemployment. After a decade starved of investment as capital has ploughed westward to the high-growth, high-productivity US, Europe is facing its greatest crisis since the mid-twentieth century. </p> <p>With unemployment at 15 per cent, the Italian far right sweeps to victory in elections on a single issue: leaving the euro, and killing the 11-year experiment in monetary union which has impoverished the country. The victory address begins: 'Since the Danes rejected it in 2000, this has clearly been a false union... </p> <p>An absurdity, of course. But for the Continent's more entrenched euro enemies, such an outcome would be a delightful conclusion flowing from the Danish rejection of the single currency in last week's referendum. </p> <p>And it makes a point which is lost in the fallout from the Danish no vote: that a successful Europe will be judged by its ability to grow, to invest in its future and to create employment - in short to compete with the soaraway US. The single currency is intended to be a milestone on that road. </p> <p>The impact on Danish voters of the euro's failure to deliver, demonstrated by its weakness against the dollar and its failure to attract investment, is difficult to unravel. More important, and equally unclear, is the impact of the Danish decision on the ability of Europe to reinvigorate its economy to challenge the US.</p> <p> In the short term, although the Danish central bank had to raise its interest rates by half of one per cent, the immediate effect on the euro itself was negligible. It fell slightly to 87.9 cents. </p> <p>There were several reasons for this. From the market's perspective a 'no' vote was widely expected. Currency traders were, in any case, nervous of selling the euro because of the concerted intervention by central banks to keep it above 85 cents nine days ago.</p> <p> If the intervention does not work and the euro slumps below that level, there will be serious questions about its future. The longer-term questions are political as well as economic. </p> <p> Janet Bush, of the pro-EU but anti- single currency group New Europe, says: 'There are two views about the Danish vote: it could speed up integration and reform in the euro zone - and the logic of that would be that the euro will be more stable. </p> <p>'Or, if the reaction to the Danish vote is that people all over Europe who have been worried about the currency start to balk at intervention, the whole thing looks rather worse. I suspect the latter is the more likely case.' </p> <p>Some City economists believe that regardless of the determination to press ahead by the euro core, the currency will remain weaker than the dollar for some time, and the dollar will continue to attract more investment because this is reflected in the economic fundamentals. </p> <p>US growth over the past year has been 6 per cent; euroland's was 3.8 per cent. American unemployment is around 4 per cent, compared with 9.1 per cent in euroland. Wage and consumer inflation are about 1 per cent higher in the US, which is still manageable. </p> <p>Philip Chitty of ABN Amro, a former Treasury economist, says: 'The underlying issue and the reason why the euro is not going to strengthen is that fundamentally it is a weak currency.' </p> <p>A key factor is the composition of the capital flow to the US - which underpins the dollar's strength. The European Central Bank vice-president, Christian Noyer, has blamed the euro's problems on speculators shifting short-term portfolio capital, such as stock market investments , to the US.</p> <p> The speculators' fun was halted by the intervention. The argument for such action is that further well timed moves by central banks could change what is simply short-term sentiment about the euro and turn the tide against the dollar. </p> <p>However, Chitty and others believe that the flight of short-term capital is a sign of a bigger problem: investors throwing in the towel because of the return on European assets, which have suffered because of long-term capital flowing out into, among other things, US businesses and factories. </p> <p>Last year \u20ac200 billion of capital left the EU, and around \u20ac55bn came in. Some \u20ac40bn of the outflow went to the US from Germany alone. </p> <p>Compounding the issue is the fact that although there have also been euroland inflows, such as Vodafone's \u00a3103bn acquisition of Mannesman, these have tended to be paid in paper, so they have little impact on the currency. </p> <p>The massive long-term investment has underpinned the dollar's long-term rise and helped to create long-term conditions - such as higher productivity - to continue to attract investment. </p> <p> In addition, long-term investment into the US accounts for 40 per cent of its current account deficit. An ABN Amro currency analyst says: 'There is a contention that the dollar will fall because of the deficit. Whether or not this is true, the currency it will not be falling against is the euro, [because it is in the single currency area] where 12 per cent of its deficit is held. It is more likely to fall against the yen, because 60 per cent of the deficit is in Asia.'</p> <p> Adair Turner, former director-general of the Confederation of British Industry and now a director of the pro-euro Business for Sterling campaign, plays down the importance of these figures.</p> <p> 'At the end of the Eighties, people were writing books saying the extent of Japanese investment in the US was worrying,' says Turner. 'Now they are saying the ability of the US to attract investment is a virtue. It all depends on fashions of the time.' </p> <p> If, however, investment flows do matter in the long term, then the ability of euroland to project itself as a booming economy competing with the dollar is paramount. This in turn depends on the ability of the EU 11 single currency member states to forge ahead to closer integration and reform, as French Finance Minister Laurent Fabius has been insisting.</p> <p> The euro's credibility is important to this process and, as UK sceptics such as Bush point out, the Danish referendum result was not a good start. However, Turner, who freely admits he would like to have seen a Yes vote, says a Danish 'no' vote does not alter the fundamentals of eurozone growth, inflation, employ ment, trade and so on. 'If we were talking about a country like France deciding not to join a currency comprising, say, Belgium, Portugal and Ireland, the impact would be dramatic. But Denmark composes about 2.1 per cent of eurozone GDP. That's small.' </p> <p>The UK, however, is another matter. The EU's bravado after Friday's vote will be more difficult to carry off if Britain or Sweden vote 'no', too. </p> <p>Turner argues that there is no reason why the Danish 'no' should lead to a similar result in this country. Floating sterling makes economic arguments of utmost importance. They are not detrimental to the case for membership, as they were in Denmark, which had little to gain in that way. </p> <p>The political arguments in Denmark rested on a diametrically opposite view of euroland taxation policy to those advanced by UK sceptics. Danes believe taxes in the currency club are so low that they threaten the future of the Danish welfare state. The British 'no' side says they are too high, forcing the UK to fund bureaucracy and waste. </p> <p>However, these differences are unlikely to impress Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, who will now surely be scaling back their ambitions to hold an early referendum on UK entry. </p> <p>But a failure by Britain to enter the euro in the foreseeable future would have a far bigger effect than Denmark's vote. The UK would add 17 per cent to the euroland GDP, not a mere 2.1 per cent, and that rejection would be from a nation of 58 million, not just 5 million.</p> <p> It is far more likely that our fictional Italian fascist would point to that fact in 2010, rather than to the Danish 'no'. </p>",
  "<b>Eurosceptic forecast </b> <p>It was Italian trade unions who started the ball rolling. Their original enthusiasm for the euro was supplanted by dismay as the sickly currency refused to get better. After decades of inappropriate interest rates set in Frankfurt, the Italian economy was grinding ever so slowly to a halt. Unemployment mounted to more than 15 per cent, and faith in Europe's grand project evaporated. </p> <p>Scepticism spread rapidly. Germans, who had never been given the chance to vote on the euro, were bitterly counting the cost of the economic integration that had followed monetary integration. It had seemed a good idea that Poland and Hungary join the euro, but when they demanded the same welfare benefits and pensions as well as the same currency, German taxpayers became fed up paying their bills for them. </p> <p>Ireland too had run out of europhoria. Its spectacular growth rates at the start of the euro - fuelled by German level interest rates - were followed by a spectacular collapse. Stuck out in the Atlantic, Ireland's economy crashed up and down like the prow of a boat hit by repeated economic waves. </p> <p>When the 'Italians for the Lire' party swept to power, it sealed the fate of the euro. After the euro collapsed to less than 10 US cents, Ireland and Germany followed suit. All that was left was a currency union between France, Belgium and the Netherlands. Lord Blair claimed credit for having had the courage to resist all calls for Britain to have a referendum on the euro. 'I was never really in favour' he told The Observer. </p> <p> <b> Europhile forecast </b></p> <p>'Will the last businessman in Britain please turn out the light' ran the Mirror headline. The early warnings from Toyota, Nissan and Siemens had been followed by the closure of all their plants. Foreign investors relocated to Ireland, the Netherlands and Poland as the pound carried on bouncing up and down uncontrollably against the world's dominant currency. </p> <p>With global markets, including oil, metals and foodstuffs now priced in euros, Britain's businesses were put at an ever bigger disadvantage. They weren't enjoying the huge economies of scale enjoyed by Euroland, which had overtaken the US as the world's largest market. Small British firms could not compete with the huge European conglomerates producing ever cheaper goods. </p> <p>Any British businessperson with ambition had to move to Europe to get a decent job. Thousands of British companies including Glaxo-Wellcome, and Unilever followed the Japanese and relocated wholesale to Euroland. Reliant, makers of the newly popular electric Robin, had caused a particular stir by moving to Milan. </p> <p>Wrought by euroscepticism that the political leaders could never overcome, Britain stayed out. Marginalised, and with an ailing economy increasingly out of step, few European leaders saw any point in easing the path. 'Of course we should have joined early,' said Lord Hague. 'But Blair would never let us.' </p>",
  "<p>In the good old days in Prague they occasionally threw their political opponents out of the window. This practice was known as defenestration , which, as every school-person ought to know, comes from the Latin de (out of ) and fenestra (window). </p> <p>I avoided window seats in Prague last week. What I did not bargain for was an egg thrown from an upstairs window while a colleague and I were walking in the main square. </p> <p>The defenestrated egg hit, with remarkable precision, the letters 'IMF' on a folder I was carrying. My colleague and I merely suffered what the military might term collateral splattering. </p> <p>We were let off lightly. The next day another colleague came dangerously close to the flying rocks and Molotov cocktails. While International Monetary Fund and World Bank officials were trying to show sympathy with the poor and let it be known that they thought anti-globalisation protesters had at least a quarter of a point, the protests got completely out of hand. </p> <p>One has often pondered the putative wonders of globalisation, and the rather triumphalist approach of western capitalism since it went global. But, as Gordon Brown reminded us in Prague, global capitalism is all we have; the task is to make it behave. </p> <p>The 'Seattle' protest movement reflects many social and environmental concerns - not least those concerning the disruption caused by the sheer pace of change in the world economy, with the US firmly in the lead. </p> <p>Indeed, a feature of this year's Bank/Fund meetings was the way the US representatives insisted on pushing the wonders of their economic miracle to the limits - anyone would have thought the Democrats faced an election next month. </p> <p>The US triumphalism had European observers counting the spoons. Certainly there has been an improvement in the productivity of the US economy - or perhaps a r-covery to the position before the oil shocks of the Seventies; and, yes, this has been associated with the information technology revolution, in which a classic 'Schumpeterian Wave' has been assisted by the US entrepreneurial culture and the availability of finance to 'men who don't wear ties'. </p> <p>But does this justify the way the US has to draw in savings from all over the world to finance itself? Is a so-called 'soft landing' really possible when the US is borrowing $1 billion a day to finance its insatiable appetite for consumer goods? The current balance of payments def-icit is the principal manifesta tion of the remarkable 'demand gap' - pinpointed by the IMF - between what the US economy can produce (even with the 'miracle') and what its consumers spend. </p> <p>Is not the combination of the miraculous claims and the insouciance about the current balance of payments deficit somewhat reminiscent of the Berlin IMF meeting of 1988, when the British Conservative government was proclaiming that deregulation had given rise to a productivity miracle, and that a balance of payments deficit no longer mattered? </p> <p>At one level the rest of the world has the US to thank for being the Consumer of Last Resort. At another level, those of us who worry about the gyrations of exchange rates, and the distance we have travelled from the re-markably stable system of the Fifties and Sixties, have the US to thank for the belated attempt to stabilise the exchange markets. </p> <p>For it appears that, contrary to the general impression that the US did not want to intervene in the exchange markets this side of the November 7 elections, the Federal Reserve was sufficiently concerned about international imbalances and the state of the euro to initiate private calls for concerted intervention, but had to wait for the Europeans to get their act together. </p> <p>'How,' as one official commented, 'could we attempt to stabilise the markets when one Euro XI finance minister was saying the level of the euro was fine, and another was saying it was too weak?' </p> <p>Apart from anything else, major US multinationals were seriously worried about the impact of the weak euro on their European profits. From the Democratic administration's point of view, a Wall Street dive, because of a panic about the future trend of profits, would be unfortunate at this stage. </p> <p>The intervention made political and economic sense. US Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers' widely reported affirmation of the need for a strong dollar was not inconsistent with the spirit of an intervention aimed at preventing the euro from a freefall. I doubt whether the Fed and the US Treasury are trying to drive the euro back to the $1.17 rate at which the euro was born, but a return to dollar-euro parity would hardly constitute a 'weak' dollar. </p> <p>Apart from currencies and the perennial third world debt problem, the other two official preoccupations in Prague were progress with what is grandly known as the world's financial architecture and, of course, oil. </p> <p>For years it was supposed at these meetings that the problems that ended up on the IMF's desks were largely caused by the profligacy of governments and the public sector. Now the vogue concern is 'private sector instability'. </p> <p>It is because they want to contain the unstable tendencies of global capitalism in its hour of triumph that finance ministers, central bankers, the IMF and the World Bank are so keen on that important but boring refrain 'supervision, regulation and transparency'. </p> <p>To the mafia element in the former Soviet empire, however, these three words are the ugly sisters of the capitalist system they have returned to with such abandon. </p> <p>'Around here they associate regulation with communism,' said one of my Czech informants. Another quipped: 'Transparency is a bit of a problem for enterprises that thrive better in the dark.' </p> <p>At all events, the Group of Seven were certainly transparent in their desire for a lower oil price. They recall how the Seventies oil shocks produced 'stagflation' (and fallen governments) and that the effects of such shocks proved difficult to forecast. </p> <p>They would rather the problem went away, but they dislike Opec's idea that the industrial countries should help via lower oil taxes. Some of their electorates seem to think differently. </p> <p>But back to those protests: it was absolutely shameful that west European thugs should have produced the worst street violence Prague has seen since the Russians clamped down in 1968. The genuine organisers of pro-tests against the excesses of globalisation need to rethink their strategy. The events in Prague were not funny.</p>",
  "Richard Dawkins's writing is usually a safeguard against sloppy thinking, but his article on GM research (Comment, last week) misses the point. <p>The work of Roentgen and Muller was contained within laboratories. Controlled experiments using genetically modified plants are not contained.

Once the genes are in the general environment they cannot be retrieved. </p> <p>If he can assure me, scientifically, that the modified genes are contained and cannot be reproduced outside the experimental area, he has won my support. If he cannot, my cheque to Greenpeace will be in the post!<br><b>Rev Chris Gardner<br>Worthing </b><br></p> <p>Dawkins is as eloquent as ever in setting out the need for controlled experiment before we decide that GM crops would be a Good Thing or a Bad Thing. I can accept all that, as I can accept his argument against popular direct action on this and other matters. But have I missed something? </p> <p>Let's assume that in fact GM crops turn out to be a Bad Thing, even a disaster. The experiments have taken place in open fields, not too far from unmodified crops. The birds, the bees and the breeze are no respecters of lines drawn on a map. Cross-pollination takes place. </p> <p>Can Professor Dawkins explain, in his persuasive way, how we then get the genie back into the bottle?<br><b>Frank Card<br>Braintree, Essex </b> <br></p> <p>Dawkins should check his facts before bemoaning the ignorance of fellow citizens. Last year the Government's Public Consultation on Developments in the Biosciences, run by MORI, suggested that even people who have been briefed for two days with information officially approved as balanced rejected GM crops. </p> <p>My own research with ActionAid using a citizens' jury of farmers in India reached similar conclusions (<a href=\"http://www.actionaid.org\" target=\"_new\">www.actionaid.org</a>).</p> <p>As a scientist who insists on ignoring the informed assessment of his fellow humans, perhaps Dawkins should apply the Strangelove title to himself.<br><b>Dr Tom Wakeford<br>Human Sciences Dept<br>Brunel University</b><br> </p> <p>As a research scientist at Oxford University and a member of Greenpeace, I support Lord Melchett's views. But I cannot see that Dawkins's diatribe promotes the public understanding of science, or addresses a single issue raised by Greenpeace's long-running campaign. </p> <p>There is a need for research into genetically manipulated or mutilated organisms, but it should be carried out in controlled laboratory conditions until more is known about the spread of artificially mutated genetic material. The trials which Greenpeace opposes are designed to test economic viability and have little chance of addressing the long-term impact on the environment.<br> <b>Dr Martin Juckes<br>Oxford </b></p>",
  "Oil giant BP has been accused of 'rank hypocrisy' after major safety breaches at British sites that risked thousands of lives. <p>During the recent fuel crisis, BP gave concern for the safety of employees as its reason for not ordering drivers to deliver fuel. Yet, in spite of record profits of \u00a34,000 a second because of the soaring oil price, BP put staff and public in danger with cost-cutting measures. </p> <p>The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) has launched an investigation into BP's 'corporate culture'. Safety breaches include: </p> <p>\u0095 Three major incidents last spring at its Grangemouth refinery complex in Scotland led to emergency alerts. In June, a fire broke out which took seven hours to control. Grangemouth contains 200 tonnes of highly flammable chemicals. Earlier in June a pipe exploded, blasting tonnes of earth on to a main road. In May the plant was shut after its main power cable failed. There were seven major safety alerts in the past 14 months at Grangemouth; </p> <p>\u0095 The HSE was so alarmed by reductions in staffing levels at BP's Coryton refinery in Essex that in January 1999 it ordered the firm to stop operating part of its plant because it believed it could not shut it down in an emergency. In April 1999 the company was prosecuted after two contractors were overcome by nitrogen fumes; </p> <p>\u0095 BP's main North Sea oil platform was shut down last summer by the HSE after two gas leaks within six days were described as having been 'near catastrophes'; </p> <p>\u0095 Serious breaches of health and safety regulations at BP's Sullom Voe oil terminal in the Shetlands in July 1999 led the government watchdog to demand measures 'to prevent major accidents and limit their consequences to persons and the environment'. </p> <p>Michael Connarty, Labour MP for Falkirk East where Grangemouth is located, has accused BP of 'hypocrisy and double standards'. He said: 'During the fuel crisis BP was telling us it was so concerned to protect the safety of its tanker drivers that it wouldn't force them to deliver petrol. But after the number of safety alerts over the last year workers have been worried sick there could be another major incident where they won't be so lucky. It is amazing that no one has been killed.' </p> <p>At Grangemouth, 600 workers will lose their jobs by 2002. </p> <p>BP's record has also come under fire after breaches of pollution legislation. This month's edition of Ends - the respected environmental magazine - contains an attack on the oil giant's environmental record. This will embarrass the company, which has recently spent millions on rebranding itself to promote its green credentials by jettisoning its shield logo and using a sunflower. </p> <p>At its Sullom Voe terminal BP breached rules over how much oil may be discharged into the sea 17 times in the year 1999-2000. A Scottish Environment Protection Agency spokesman said the breaches were minor, but 'the fact there were 17 over a year makes them significant'. The Institute of Environmental Management and Assessment found them serious enough to withdraw certification of the terminal - the first time this has happened in the UK. </p> <p>In May 1999, BP faced a record fine for pollution in Scotland after it overfilled a tank of the Scottish Borders Council recycling centre. This contaminated the River Tweed, and BP was fined \u00a315,000 and had to pay \u00a3200,000 in clean-up costs. Grangemouth has had a 24 per cent increase in discharge of pollutants and a fourfold increase in oil losses from spills. </p> <p>A BP spokesman said: 'Unfortunately accidents can happen. But, regardless of any cost-cutting, safety is never compromised. When an accident happens our priority is to find out why and work with the authorities to ensure it never happens again.'</p>",
  "Light up, take a puff and blame your parents. Smoking, apparently, is in the genes. In a snub to those who blame peer pressure, rock stars and Formula One, an American study has proved for the first time that the habit of smoking regularly is largely inherited. <p>The findings raise the possibility of genetically testing smokers to determine the best treatment for helping them to give up. </p> <p>In the first study of its kind, researchers from Virginia Commonwealth University analysed the habits of 778 pairs of twins, some of whom were brought up together and some separated in early childhood. The results, published in the Archives of General Psychiatry , show that 60 per cent of the differences between people's susceptibility to smoking is genetic, 20 per cent is due to family environment and 20 per cent due to the individual's experiences. </p> <p>'Individuals differ substantially in their vulnerability to smoking. It's not the case that people smoke just because of social peer pressure,' said the author, Dr Kenneth Kendler. </p> <p>He says there isn't a single 'smoking gene', but many genes that cause some people to find giving up much harder than others. Some genes may make nicotine more addictive or pleasant. Others could give a predisposition to character traits, such as being stressed, that make smoking more likely. </p> <p>But Kendler insisted that 'bad genes' were no excusefor smoking. 'Genes may make it more pleasurable or more addictive, but they don't make you pick up a cigarette and light it. Smoking remains a voluntary act.' </p> <p>The report has sparked fierce debate in the US, reminiscent of the uproar that followed the claim of a 'gay gene', which was equally welcomed and reviled. </p> <p>Amanda Sandford, head of research at the anti-smoking charity Ash, welcomed the findings: 'We've always had the suspicion that there's more to getting people to give up. It seems very plausible that some people are more genetically predisposed to be addicted. They could be targeted for extra special help in giving up.' </p> <p>However, the genetic theory was ridiculed by Simon Clark, director of the smoker's rights organisation, Forest. 'In the Seventies, the anti-smoking lobby were forced to accept that adults have a right to choose. Ever since, they've been looking at ways of getting round that - first passive smoking, then the addiction argument, now the idea that it's genetic,' said Clark. </p> <p>'It would be terrible to think there are people suppressing their tobacco gene.'</p>",
  "It's highly confusing, meeting Kanya King. I don't mean just because of the music-talk stuff, though there is that ...the myriad fine gradations between hip and hop and house, garage and bhangra and gangsta and jungle and trip hop and rap. <p>I think I've got the fundamentals sorted out: house is the stuff that sounds like a giant moron banging in an endless nail with his head, whereas hip hop is the stuff that sounds like four hours of a photocopier warming up. (And no, I'm not being patronising: it's just that if you really don't know, and are at that stage in life where the only bits in the songs that you recognise are the samples stolen from old Steely Dan tracks, then it's terribly trendy-vicar and Mr Tony to try to pretend. Suffice it to say that, according to age, class, number of drugs taken and the increasingly less important factor of race, some of it sounds absurdly glorious and some of it makes your brain bleed.) </p> <p>The confusing thing about Kanya herself, talking about race and class and music, is that she is so relentlessly, hopelessly, nice about everything, to the point of saccharinity. </p> <p>This is a woman born the youngest of a 'very poor' black-Irish family of nine, whose Ghanaian father died when she was 13, whose mother can recall the signs in London which said 'no blacks, no Irish, no dogs' and struggled not only to find them a home but to protect them from the hate-mail and racist packages. </p> <p>Who put herself through college and then, while trying to promote black bands, found herself up against one of the most cynical, white-run businesses in our cynical, white global marketplace. Who then had to fight the business's even more cynical nephew, the 'enlightened' producers who were happy to film black music being made, but only if in a seedy club, with bands that turned up shambolically late or not at all, and perhaps a shooting or two thrown in for good measure. Yo, blood. </p> <p>So you would understand it if Kanya, now 30, the woman behind the phenomenally successful Mobo awards - the formula, denoting 'Music Of Black Origin', which has over the past five years proved subtly adept at promoting black music, or black-by-formation music, without ghettoising it - had a few things to say about race, or class, or corporate cynicism. Well, she does, but they're all awfully nice. </p> <p>We are all living in much more enlightened, multi-cultural times, she beams. Of course, white people can make good 'black' music, she says, to my raised eyebrow (she hasn't obviously played in the same Dundee pubs I have, where the Average White Band's legacy used to be mauled thrice nightly): 'I think, you know, any artist, they're influenced by whoever, but they put their own spin on it, which is important.' Hmm. </p> <p>And there's no resentment of the way the corporations have now muscled in on Mobo after five years of growing success. (This week's awards, for instance, are massively sponsored by a major credit-card company who I'm not going to name because they once refused me a card.) 'No, I think it's important for us to work in harmony with the record companies. </p> <p>No resentment at all, because we don't work in isolation, and at the end you want the artists to have record sales.' Every possible bone of contention I throw at her is sweetly batted back with a wide pragmatic smile. It's like being sucker-punched by a g\u00e2teau. </p> <p>Which is perhaps the way it had to be. After years of black music's associations of anger, mistrust and violence, perhaps it was inevitable - though no less ironic for that - that its success, its biggest breakthrough in Britain, should come in such a very Nineties way, through slick marketing, lack of confrontation, sweet smiles from Kanya and a massive dose of pragmatism.</p> <p>'What we've tried to do is not harp on about what's negative, or doesn't work: this is a celebration.' The front seats at Alexandra Palace will be removed for this week's long-sold-out concert to let fans promenade closer to the stage; Henry Wood's legacy lives on in the new Britain, and race war has left the building. </p> <p>One of the oddest things about Mobo, I suggest, is the blinding obviousness of its categorisation. Surely every piece of rock or pop music for the past half-century is 'of black origin'? Take the black influences out of music and surely all you'd be left with would be a 4/4 on-the-beat tattoo of unimaginative guitar riffs, bereft of clever harmonies, or soul, or surprises. You'd be left with Status Quo. </p> <p>'Absolutely! But that's exactly why it was founded. Most people whole-heartedly agree that most forms of popular music have their heritage in black music, so we wanted to celebrate that fact. And if we can run alongside the Brit awards - we all know the Brits is about the industry, and tends to focus on successful pop - then isn't it wonderful to have another event where those not yet as huge can get recognition, and success?' </p> <p>The subtext here, as she explains, is that, had the awards simply been Black Music Awards, then it could have been 'exclusive rather than inclusive'. So Bono and Mick Hucknall have presented and won awards; white rapper Eminem regularly cleans up. It might offend purists, but my goodness it's working. </p> <p>The voting website took two million hits last month, and Mobo - not just the awards ceremony but the whole package Kanya has been running from her Euston base since hitting on her clever formulation; the publishing company and the production group and the annual album - is about to go international. Her palpable excitement inspires, even though she concedes, her ready smile vanishing for perhaps the only time in our meeting, that America, both black and white America, might be a little less willing to watch (in the words of one of the less inspiringly radical musical-racial collaborations of recent years) ebony and ivory sitting side by side in perfect harmony. </p> <p>Was it possible, I wondered, that her catch-all net was in danger of becoming too wide? She has done, obviously, a magnificent job of promoting good black music. R'n'B, hip hop and dance now account for something approaching 40 per cent of music sales in Britain, the third biggest pop-music market in the world: a figure which has almost doubled since 1994. </p> <p>But was it hard for her to reconcile such diverse strands as, for instance, gospel and rap, one side serving up heavy dollops of Christianity, albeit with a good bit of style, and the other trying to get us to shoot our white nigga ho' bitches with our love guns (or however the precise terminology runs)? </p> <p>'Actually not all rap music is like that at all. That's just the headline stuff. Rap is so broad, I don't think you can generalise. My own favourites depend on my mood. I sometimes listen to hip hop, but then think, oh my God, I need some jazz, or something Irish, ballady. Then again my 17-year-old niece is fanatical about gospel music, and recently organised a concert, and the talent was just phenomenal... but there was also rap at the same concert, from black and white. It's all part of the same, it's all about passion, and believing in something.' </p> <p>And Kanya - still unmarried, she says with the usual huge smile, but not exactly looking - proceeds to get passionate about another Mobo fixture, the Unsigned Act Award, where regional competitions whittle down winners and take them on to contracts and stardom. 'You would not believe the response now, even though it's only being going for a couple of years,' she tells me. Most of the record company executives had said to us - an award show's about winners, nobody's interested in unsigned talent. Of course, they're right. But it's something we're very close to, the grass roots, and we get sent thousands of tapes...so we did it anyway.' </p> <p>No, Kanya. Of course the record company executives were wrong. You were right. But for as long as it suits you to say it, and keep smiling and pretending, and keep the contracts and the music coming, then the pragmatism and the marketing and the careful corporate politicking don't, in the end, seem to matter. In the oldest sense of the word, respect. </p> <p>The Mobo website is: <a href=\"http://www.mobo.net\" target=\"_NEW\">mobo.net</a></p>",
  "They called it Operation Starburst, in a nod to the military-style management consultant jargon William Hague still holds dear. <p>Four days ago the unsuspecting voters of the West Midlands awoke to a virtual invasion by the entire Shadow Cabinet. </p> <p>Fanning out across schools, hospitals, pensioners' day centres and police stations, the Tory team had two objectives: reminding the nation who on earth they are, and beginning to weave a story that could stabilise the seesawing polls in their favour. The nation has probably learnt more about the private William Jefferson Hague in the past three days than it bothered to find out in the past three years: from his dad's speeding fines to his overspending on sherry at Oxford (shades of the 14 pints again) to the tricks his makeup artist uses to stop his bald head glistening. </p> <p>But while this avalanche of trivia is ostensibly due to a soft-focus TV documentary and a new biography, it is really triggered by the political turmoil of the past weeks which has left Britain thinking the unthinkable. </p> <p>What if this man could really be the next Prime Minister? And if so, is he really the bluff Yorkshire populist of Smith Square folklore, or is his the more complicated story told by some colleagues of a privately liberal man, reined in by a prejudiced party he expected to have more time to change? Beneath a plastic backdrop of jagged abstract shapes at his party conference, William Hague must this week answer the questions. Tony Blair has faltered, and his rival is pushed blinking into the spotlight to demonstrate that he is capable of forming a government. </p> <p>'What I think we have done this week is prove that Labour are mortal,' says Ann Widdecombe. 'And it's now up to us.' Even some in his own party, as stunned by the sudden lurch in the polls as Labour, are not convinced Hague can do it. There is a sense that this was not in the game plan. </p> <p>'This is a massive opportunity, but the question is can he take it,' says one senior ex-Central Office aide. 'The party has come up in the polls, but he personally hasn't. If the polls said the Tories had edged one point ahead but William's standing had catapulted upwards, that to me would have been more significant.' </p> <p>The first attempt at a convincing narrative about who he and his party are comes tonight, in Channel 4's Just William...and Ffion , the apparently everyday tale of an amiable bloke whose right-wing 'common sense' somehow pitched him seamlessly into the leadership of the Conservative Party, quietly confident of victory at the next election. </p> <p>But it is not the whole story. 'He never took the job anticipating he would win,' says one formerly good friend. 'The best Tory punters were not talking about that, they believed there was no way they could win an election for two terms after the last, some even said three. </p> <p>'He is not like you think at all in private, he is quite liberal or very liberal, and he surrounds himself with very similar people. </p> <p>'But one gets the feeling that he politically or internally is quite hemmed in by either the favours he owes people or having to include people he is relatively scared of, like Widdecombe, or Redwood.' </p> <p>If Hague finds himself under friendly fire this week, it will not be from these two. But other guns are trained upon him. On Tuesday lunchtime, Ken Clarke will chair a pro-euro rally. </p> <p>The timing is provocative. For outside in the bracing winds sweeping Cliff Walk, the plastic Union Jacks and the gilt pound sign badges on blazer lapels will mark out those massing for the Keep the Pound rally, the official anti-euro event. </p> <p>Last year when the two camps' meetings coincided, it all ended in young Eurosceptics hurling peanuts at Michael Heseltine. This year was meant to be different. Friends say the big cats of the Tory Left - Clarke, Heseltine, Leon Brittan and Chris Patten - agreed in early summer not to go for the kill over Europe at the party conference, for the sake of party loyalty. </p> <p>Then came Hague's September mini-manifesto rejecting any further European integration. Clarke was, says an ally, 'spitting tacks' and Brittan, a mentor to the young Hague who bequeathed him his safe seat, was apparently incensed. The gloves will now come off. </p> <p>At least a handbagging from Baroness Thatcher - who has previously publicly disapproved of Hague sharing a pre-marital bed with Ffion, and upstaged him with a glitzy rally for General Pinochet - is unlikely: she is only staying one day. </p> <p>An embarrassing ghost is hovering in the shape of Lord Archer, due in magistrates' court on perjury charges on Tuesday. </p> <p>Hague's own environment spokesman Damian Green will tomorrow warn against a lurch to the right. </p> <p>In a pamphlet called Restoring the Balance, he warns against moralising on voters' sex lives, attacks on the public sector and thinly veiled racism, adding: 'There must be no \"cricket tests\" in the Conservative Party.' </p> <p>The tone Hague wants to strike was set during Starburst, when he visited an inner-city Birmingham comprehensive rather than a leafy suburban grammar. </p> <p>Private polls have shown the Tories creeping ahead in the West Midlands and in the South-east, the electoral weathervanes where Blair's 1997 landslide was won. </p> <p>But recovery here requires more than the die-hard votes of the europhobic hard Right: job losses at Longbridge, grammar schools and hospitals are the 'swing' issues. </p> <p>'There is a swath of middle England who, even if they are not in the inner cities themselves, want to vote for a party that cares about them,' says Social Security spokesman David Willetts. </p> <p>'It is about the decent, well-intentioned middle-aged middle-class people, perhaps a teacher who feels a bit fed up with all the red tape tied up with their school. They don't want to feel they are voting for selfish reasons.' </p> <p>Hague's aides agree. 'We want to demonstrate this week that we are about more than crime, asylum and Europe. It's about an agenda for government, not for opposition.' </p> <p>Hague limbers up for conference seriously. He won't drink all week, eats a carbo-loaded diet heavy on pasta, and works out in the gym of his Richmond home. His trio of speechwriters have spent three days and nights cloistered in Yorkshire, hammering out the speech. </p> <p>His chief policy wonk, Danny Finkelstein, hones the jokes; speechwriter George Osborne furnishes purple prose; adviser Johnathan Caines supplies the experience. </p> <p>But only Hague can muster the one quality which, the focus groups snipe, he lacks so far: statesmanship. </p> <p>He also wants to boost the profiles of his largely anonymous Shadow Cabinet. </p> <p>'In the early days the press said William was nobody and the rest of them were a complete shower,' recalls one senior aide. 'Then they said he was half-competent but the rest were a shower, bar maybe one or two. Now they say he is impressive, but they're interested in the rest. </p> <p>'We could have focused more on policy and more on William as an individual. But the time has come. If they're thinking of voting Conservative, people need to be convinced the Conservative Party is more than just its leader.' </p> <p>Other colleagues doubt however that sweet reason can prevail. Hague's fatal flaw, says one senior Tory, is a failure of nerve against tabloid aggression: </p> <p>'The nine o'clock meetings (when the shadow Cabinet plans its day) increasingly consist of reading out the good bits from the Mail . </p> <p>'If the tabloids will row in behind it we will do it, but it leaves a nasty taste in the mouth. They just can't resist instant gratification.' </p> <p>And while Smith Square has plundered the 'compassionate conservatism' manifesto of George W. Bush for some policy clues, the main lessons drawn from repeated trips to Texas have been hard-headed organisation. </p> <p>'What we have been following in America is how you tackle a skilled campaigner like a Clinton or a Blair when the economy is actually doing well,' says Willetts. </p> <p>'The argument will be this guy comes in in 1997 with the most favourable circumstances in half a century, what more could you ask for, and what has he got to show for it? </p> <p>'Dole was a terrible warning for us. You can't just go around telling everyone the country's in a terrible state, it's too bleak.' </p> <p>Insiders point out that Shadow Chancellor Michael Portillo has quietly ditched predecessor Francis Maude's dire warnings of impending recession. </p> <p>Meanwhile Portillo's own performance will fall under intense scrutiny this week. </p> <p>Last week's unexpected surge for the Tories has unsettled some Portillo groupies still fantasising about a leadership challenge to follow the expected defeat at the next election. If Hague managed to slash Labour's majority to less than 60, his position could be secure after all. </p> <p>Portillo will ensure he is on his most loyal behaviour this week. It could, after all, be the one that determines his future too. </p> <p><b> How governments recover from poll depths</b><br> </p> <p> <b> Parliament Governing Lowest Vote at next Recovery </b></p> <p><b>Party Rating % Election % </b></p> <p><b>1959-64</b> Conservative 31 43 +12 </p> <p><b> 1966-70</b> Labour 28 44 +16 </p> <p><b> 1970-74</b> Conservative 31 39 +8 </p> <p><b> 1974-79</b> Labour 30 38 +8 </p> <p><b> 1979-83</b> Conservative 27 43 +16 </p> <p><b> 1983-87</b> Conservative 30 43 +13 </p> <p><b> 1987-92</b> Conservative 30 43 +13 </p> <p><b> 1992-97</b> Conservative 22 31 +9 </p> <p><b> 1997-</b> Labour 34* - - </p> <p> Source: Kellner/Sanders Index *correct to September 2000</p>",

  "<p>Sony Corporation's products are the stuff of the Zeitgeist of the consumer age. Walkmans, Discmans, laptops and most recently WAP phones, marketed to the dance generation, have let Sony promote itself - despite the scale of its operations - as the funky face of global enterprise. </p> <p>There have, of course, been a few hiccups in the company's glossy corporate image - notably George Michael's highly publicised and successful extrication from his Sony recording contract, amid accusations of Sony's suits stifling and bullying the creative urge. But it has done little to take the shine off a generation's favourite manufacturer. In Prague last week the eco-warriors weren't stomping their Walkmans. Anti-capitalist activists carried placards lambasting McDonald's, but it is the sort of stick Sony has avoided. </p> <p>All that is likely to change, however, as news gets around that the entertainment and technology giant advocates spying on eco-friendly groups who criticise those same sleek, ergonomic lines on its products. </p> <p>It sounds like something out of a futuristic dystopia. It is also true. Earlier this summer, to representatives of the European Information and Communications Technology Industry Association in Brussels, Andrew Baynes, project manager at Sony International (Europe), made Sony's pitch against eco-activism. Sony's problem with the greenies is this: its products contain toxins and are difficult to dispose of. Environmentalists would like tougher controls. Sony wants to avoid them. </p> <p>Its strategy is outlined in a leaked paper currently doing the rounds of the alternative internet community. Titled 'NGO Strategy', it bears all the Cold War histrionics of J. Edgar Hoover's G-Men. The document discloses the names, contacts and internet addresses of leading environmental groups that pose a public relations threat to the company - the Northern Alliance for Sustainability, Greenpeace, the European Environment Bureau, the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition and Friends of the Earth. </p> <p>The electronics industry, including Sony, has been fighting efforts by environmentalists who would prefer the manufacturers to take responsibility for environmental and health hazards of product disposal. In the EU, these efforts have culminated in the European Commission Directive on Waste from Electrical and Electronic Equipment - or WEEE. The proposed law would force manufacturers such as Sony to take financial responsibility for managing their products throughout their life cycle, a period that includes disposal. Compulsory targets for collection will be set in 2006 - when between 70 and 90 per cent by weight of all collected equipment must be recycled or re-used. The directive would further propose the phasing out by 2008 of mercury, lead, cadmium and other toxic chemicals commonly used by the electronics industry. </p> <p>The cost to the electronics industry could be astronomical. And since the European legislation surfaced several years ago, the American Electronic Association - an industrial umbrella organisation for more than 3,000 companies, including IBM, Microsoft, Motorola and Intel - has launched a major offensive against extended producer responsibility. The AEA says the legislation contradicts World Trade Organisation code. </p> <p>Sony's presentation makes for sobering reading - after three global demonstrations in the last year, are NGOs still to be characterised as subversive operatives? 'NGO Activity to watch out for!' reads page five - with added links to literature published online by Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace. The environmental organisations are further identified as 'highly active' and 'well organised' with a 'global reach'. </p> <p>'Don't wait!!' is the mandate from the Sony report to company personnel. Sony's recommendation is the hiring of corporate press officers as rapid reaction units. And the preparation of industry-wide template responses - as opposed to the dribs and drabs of contradicting information usually associated with press offices. </p> <p>So far, you might think, Sony's is the response indicative of any corporate behemoth facing the prospect of having to take responsibility for its products. But then follows the punch line. The presentation suggests the electronics industry employ 'web investigation agencies' as a solution to pesky online critics. London-based Infonic Plc are the web snoops recommended by Sony. </p> <p>Infonic's website is a defiant call to arms for blue-chip companies besieged by online activists following the swell of protests in Seattle, Washington and, more recently, Prague. 'Suddenly a company's voice is no longer louder than that of its leading critics. Activists, customers, journalists and employees are talking to each other like never before, with big business finding it increasingly difficult to stay in the conversation.' </p> <p>The internet detectives boast few morals in terms of the clients they take on. Infonic first rose to prominence when the company was hired by Shell International to decipher the internet as a barometer for public opinion in the aftermath of Greenpeace's victorious occupation of the Brent Spar oil platform in 1995. Other clients featured on the company website include British Airways, Levis Strauss &amp; Co and Unilever. </p> <p>The use of internet trawlers like Infonic to specifically monitor NGOs sets a precedent in the commercial sector. The monitoring of internet-friendly activists has, in recent years, taken on an alarming momentum. The Big Brother of internet investigation agencies, America's E:Watch, helps more than 800 of the world's largest corporations keep track of their reputations across cyberspace. A watchful eye on the antics of corporate protesters, naturally, is a priority. E:Watch clients include the H. J. Heinz company and Northwest Airlines. 'You'll hear rumours before they start to spread,' assures its website. 'You'll be among the first to find out about negative or inaccurate information - instead of the last.' </p> <p>Commercial companies using internet detectives to snoop around the websites of their detractors? It sounds like an alarming development in the information war. Until now, the activities of protest groups have traditionally been monitored by governmental agencies. Last May, the Paris-based 'Intelligence Newsletter' reported that reserve units from US Army Intelligence were deployed to monitor the 16-18 April protests against the IMF and World Bank in Washington. 'The Pentagon sent around 700 men from the Intelligence and Security Command at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, to assist the Washington police on 17 April, including specialists in human and signals intelligence,' the report said. </p> <p>According to the newsletter, activist files are being circulated via the Regional Information Sharing System, a networked database used by 5,300 law enforcement agencies in the US, the FBI, the US Drug Enforcement Administration, the Internal Revenue Service, the Secret Service, US Customs and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. The activities of anarchic groups detailed by RISS include findings on Greenpeace, the American Indian Movement and the Zapatista National Liberation Front. </p> <p>Sony's advocacy of Infonic, on the face of it, might not amount to anything more than a smear campaign against the likes of Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth. But environmental organisations that rely on funding for survival could find themselves crippled in the face of unsubstantiated rumours. 'People on the boards of foundations are very much part of the establishment,' says Iza Kruszewska, spokesperson for the Northern Alliance for Sustainability. 'Big corporations hold a powerful sway over their opinions on funding NGOs.' </p> <p>The nervous shiver that characterises the language employed by the Sony report has been met with mild bemusement by the various environmental organisations named within its pages. California's Silicon Valley Toxic Coalition employs no more than 14 staffers at its San Jose offices. 'There's little need for web investigation agencies,' laughs Ted Smith, its executive director. 'We're hardly a Fortune 500 company. If they want to know anything about us, all Sony has to do is read our website.'</p>",
  "<p>Stung by global criticism, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have embarked on a public relations campaign over the past few months, claiming that reducing poverty is now at the heart of their strategies. But critics say any change is cosmetic. </p> <p>Three weeks ago IMF managing director Horst K\u00f6hler addressed a meeting of non-governmental organisations - mainly charities and development campaigners - in London. One bemused member of his audience said: 'He did not sound like an IMF managing director at all. He was saying things like \"Privatisation should not be seen as an ideology\".' </p> <p>Both institutions have been trying to recast themselves as transparent, listening organisations, mindful of the downsides to globalisation. </p> <p>The Bank's showpiece 'World Development Report', released three weeks ago, revealed a shift in thinking. Concepts such as empowerment and security were moved to the heart of the agenda, supplementing the traditional focus on economic growth and liberalisation. Bank president James Wolfensohn said this 'substantially deepens what we think is necessary to meet the challenge of reducing poverty'. </p> <p>In the build-up to the report, the Bank consulted 60,000 people for a study called,'Voices of the Poor'. </p> <p>But the critics who claim that nothing substantial has changed point to key alterations between the draft report and the final version. Evidence that the two bodies' trade liberalisation policies had been bad for the poor was relegated to footnotes. The author of the more radical version, Professor Ravi Kanbur of Cornell University, New York, resigned over differences with Bank economists. </p> <p>To great fanfare, the IMF adopted poverty reduction as one of its strategic targets at last year's annual meetings. K\u00f6hler went on a 'listening tour' of countries and institutions. Structural adjustment policies (SAPs) became poverty reduction strategy papers (PRSPs), penned not by the IMF but by the nations themselves. </p> <p>'It was an amazing change in acronyms,' says Jessica Woodroffe of the World Development Movement, 'but there has been no real change in the substance of policy prescriptions.' </p> <p>Already, the nobly titled poverty reduction strategies are being accused of delaying the already slow pace of debt relief for the countries most heavily in debt. </p> <p>In Prague, NGOs and some governments said the Bank and the Fund were linking their Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) debt initiative to a poverty reduction strategy - with dire consequences. </p> <p>The HIPC initiative was launched in 1996, and 10 countries are now receiving relief: Benin, Bolivia, Burkina Faso, Honduras, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Senegal, Tanzania and Uganda. They should save about $750 million in their annual debt service payments, according to the Bank. But, says Ted van Hees, co-ordinator of the Brussels-based European Network on Debt and Development, countries are now required to jump fresh bureaucratic hurdle by producing PRSPs to reach a 'decision point' at which officials make a ruling on whether they qualify for debt relief under the HIPC initiative. </p> <p>When nations reach the decision point they receive a small amount of relief. They then have to jump through further hoops before reaching 'completion point', where their debts are finally cancelled. </p> <p>The PRSPs impose a new layer of conditions, says van Hees, and tie 'a complicated debt relief strategy' to make a complex system even more cumbersome. This 'serves to delay debt relief'. </p> <p>The WDM's Woodroffe says Mali's most recent IMF deal, signed only last month, 'lists almost 100 macroeconomic and structural adjustment measures to be implemented in the period 1999-2002, many related to privatisation and reorganisation of activities traditionally conducted by government'. </p> <p>At the annual meeting of the Bank and the Fund in Prague last week, the Commonwealth Secretariat said the changes had introduced a serious new aid bottleneck. Debt campaigners believe that the world bodies could improve things by giving a more substantial amount of relief at the decision point. </p> <p>Axel van Trotsenburg, manager of the HIPC implementation unit at the Bank, denies that PRSPs are holding up debt relief. As soon as countries reached their decision points, they could start receiving help. 'Work is progressing favourably' for 20 indebted countries to be in that position by the end of this year, he says. </p> <p>The Bank claims that HIPC relief for them would amount to 'well over $30bn over 60 per cent of the HIPC programme'. Forty-one countries qualify under the initiative and $50bn of their debt will eventually be cancelled. </p> <p>'A further $50bn could be cancelled in other ways'- making a total of $100bn, says van Trotsenburg. </p> <p>But Jubilee 2000, the debt relief campaign, says this shows the initiative's limitations. Even if the $100bn were reached, it would fall far short of the $370bn owed by 52 developing countries. </p> <p>Jubilee 2000 director Ann Pettifor is deeply disappointed: 'The credibility of the Bank/IMF debt initiative evaporated in the Prague sunshine.' </p> <p>The Bank wants to alleviate poverty by focusing on problems inside the debt-laden countries, such as corruption and institutional failure. </p> <p>But the NGOs say that focus is too narrow. They want more stress on reform of the entire international economic system to make it fairer to the developing nations. </p> <p>Until that changes, they say, all this talk about poverty reduction is just so much PR. </p> <p><strong>Paying the price for debt relief</strong></p> <p><strong> Benin: </strong> Forced to liberalised cotton sector and introduce performance-based compensation system for its civil service. </p> <p><strong> Bolivia: </strong> The speed of the drawing up of a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper to satisfy HIPC requirements has denied poorer groups proper involvement in the process, and has ended up with 'wish-lists' rather than the development of appropriated policies to address poverty. </p> <p><strong> Honduras: </strong> Entry into the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative was delayed while the IMF demanded more progress on electricity privatisation Subsidies are now being reduced in water supply, electricity and public transport, with the poor less able to afford subsequent price rises. </p> <p><strong> Malawi: </strong> The IMF is demanding the rapid introduction of expenditure controls and settlement of government arrears with the private sector, prior to agreeing entry into HIPC. </p> <p><strong> Tanzania: </strong> Complicated privatisation of National Bank of Commerce delayed debt relief for months. </p> <p><strong> Zambia: </strong> Forced to privatise copper mines leading to the loss of 60,000 jobs. </p> <p> Sources: Oxfam and The World Development Movement</p>",
  "<p>Picture the future frontline of the automobile war. Scene one. You're gridlocked on the M25 for more than an hour. By the time you come off Britain's longest car park you've bought some shares, booked a restaurant and arranged to view a house for sale nearby. As you leave the motorway a voice from the car's onboard computer directs you to the property. </p> <p>Scene two. Your car has overturned. You're unconscious, but the airbag has cushioned the impact, and triggered an alarm system which alerted the emergency services. The ambulance will find you, because the car has a global positioning system. </p> <p>Scene three. The petrol tank is low. A display beamed on to your rear-view mirror shows you the nearest petrol station which is offering you a free car wash. </p> <p>Scene four. Although you don't know it, a car accident 15 miles ahead means you are heading for long delays. A screen built into your dashboard plots an alternative route. Meanwhile, your engine's computer diagnostics system uses the internet to book the car in for a check-up at your local garage </p> <p>Fanciful? Maybe now, but not in five years' time. Telematics - providing information and services to cars using telecommunications - is new in Britain now, but it is set to be the Next Big Thing. It is already being talked about in the hushed tones analysts used to describe e-commerce five years ago. </p> <p>The predictions made for the exponential growth rate of telematics business are astounding. One of the biggest players in the market, US-based firm Delphi, suggests that half of all new cars could have telematic devices fitted as standard by 2005. </p> <p>The Economist Intelligence Unit predicts that more than 4 million cars sold in Western Europe in 2005 will have onboard navigation systems. And analysts at Deutsche Bank predicts that the telematics market will grow from $1 billion in 1998 to $42bn in 2010. </p> <p>Turning cars into mobile super computers is driven by forecasts of unprecedented congestion. Telematics help drivers find ways around the jams or, failing that, connects them to the wired world so that while stuck in traffic, they can communicate as efficiently as if they were at home or in the office. After all, some people practically live in their cars already. US consumers spend a whopping 500 million hours a week in their vehicles. In Europe, between 50 and 70 per cent of all mobile phone minutes are accounted for by drivers. </p> <p>Apart from cutting journey times, telematics' proponents argue that it reduces anxiety. 'When drivers know the nature and extent of a problem, they get less stressed about it,' said Bill McIntosh, financial director at Traffic-master, the UK company rolling out a pan-European vehicle navigation system. </p> <p>The firm's roadside sensors monitor the state of traffic. The information is processed and sent to drivers, via either mobile phones or devices built into cars. Trafficmaster users can also opt to pay for a tracking system that monitors vehicles' whereabouts - handy for, say, haulage firms worried about thefts. </p> <p>But it is not just technically savvy companies such as Trafficmaster which are excited about telematics. The big motor manufacturers, are disciples too, hoping that sales of this hi-tech kit will improve their tight margins. </p> <p>General Motors is attempting to dominate the market with its OnStar system. Originally available only on GM luxury models, OnStar has been developed from a navigation and emergency response system to embrace other multimedia functions, such as video and email. </p> <p>Significantly, GM is offering other carmakers the chance to fit OnStar, which suggests the firm will soon look to float off this business. </p> <p>Analysts at Deutsche Bank predicted last May that OnStar could generate revenues of $4bn by 2005. </p> <p>Meanwhile, rival Ford's Connect telematics system could be worth $3.2bn in five years. Earlier this year Ford unveiled prototype cars called 24-7s. These all have integrated telematic systems which, apart from turning vehicles into something like Kit, the camp-sounding onboard computer featured in the TV series Knight Rider, allow you to 'personalise' your car interior using a voice activation system. Want a pink dashboard? Just tell the car that's the mood you're in. </p> <p>The Economist Intelligence Unit says around 20 per cent of the value of an executive's car is based on its electronics systems. By 2005 this will reach 30 per cent. </p> <p>In addition, motor manufacturers know that by developing telematics systems they can can cut content deals with information providers and generate subscription revenues, so easing the cyclical nature of their industry. Ford already has a deal with AOL, while GM has Yahoo! on its side. </p> <p>But will the likes of Ford and GM be able dominate the telematics industry in the long run? McIntosh said: 'The debate will be about who controls the customers. It will be interesting to see whether it is the car manufacturers or the telecoms companies. It's difficult to see how that works out, because the two sectors' planning cycles are very different, and putting anything into a car takes up to five years.' </p> <p>So far the car industry as a whole has been extremely slow in cornering the market. Only 2 per cent of car phones are fitted by the manufacturer; the rest are fitted later. </p> <p>Big mobile phone firms are on the prowl. Vodafone, for instance, has a dedicated telematics arm, and is planning to launch its own vehicle tracking service. The mobile phone giant is talking to a number of carmakers about supplying onboard telematic systems as standard, although it declines to comment on specifics. </p> <p>But the danger is that drivers could soon have too much information. 'The industry needs to be focused,' McIntosh said. 'All this infotainment such as \"where's the nearest hotel, petrol station or golf course\" - where do you draw the line? Clearly, there is an issue of driver overload. There's only a certain amount of information that they can efficiently handle. Safety analysts are now starting to look at telematics.' </p> <p>Nevertheless, telematics is ripe for growth. The words 'information superhighway' have just taken on a whole new meaning.</p>",
  "<p>Fair trade chocolate and coffee may be a familiar sight on household shelves. But a new study has found the British do not practise what they preach when it comes to 'green' groceries. </p> <p>The most in-depth research ever undertaken into ethical consumerism has found that, although most people claim to take environmental and social issues into account when filling their shopping basket, such discrimination largely evaporates before they reach the checkout. </p> <p>The study also found that, far from being regarded as a positive or fashionable description, younger people dislike the label of 'ethical consumers'. </p> <p>According to the independent Co-operative Bank survey, 88 per cent of those questioned claimed to be ethical shoppers who took environmental and social concerns into consideration. But when the same people were asked in more depth about their actions in the supermarket, only 23 per cent could name any behaviour on their part that would justify their claim. </p> <p>'We were concerned and surprised by these findings,' said Simon Williams, co-author of the report and head of corporate affairs at the bank. 'The enthusiasm of the early Nineties seems to have leaked away and the most pessimistic interpretation of these figures is that ethical consumerism is just a temporary trend which is already sliding out of fashion.' </p> <p>Although one in three people questioned believed the impact a product had on the environment was important, one in seven would choose a product because of the company's environmental policies. And, despite the wave of consumer consciousness shown by the recent anti-capitalism demonstrations in Prague, Seattle and London, over three-quarters of those questioned rated brand name, value for money and customer services above ethical considerations. </p> <p>The survey of almost 2,000 people also turned the assumption that younger people are more value-driven on its head with the discovery that those under 35 are far less concerned than their elders in making ethical decisions. This group rarely recycles, does not shop locally and is far more interested in fashion and convenience than other sections of society. </p> <p>While around 60 per cent said they felt they did not have enough information to make an ethical judgment on a company's behaviour, over half the respondents nevertheless believed their choice could make a difference to companies' ethical policies. </p> <p>'When shoppers feel they can make a difference by choosing ethically, they usually are far more inclined to do so,' said Williams. 'But this survey has shown the vast majority of the public are still failing to act on their beliefs.' </p> <p>But other experts reject the temptation to blame the consumer for failing to carry through their convictions. 'It's easy to blame the consumers for being lazy and unconcerned, but why should we look to them, the least informed and least resourced part of the equation, to change the way the world works?,' said Rob Harrison, editor of The Ethical Consumer Magazine. </p> <p>'Markets are not consumer-led, they choose to indoctrinate the consumers to want things,' he added. 'The companies and the Government have more responsibility to operate ethically than the consumers. The Government can regulate unethical products and services out of the market and force companies to give consumers the information they want and need.' </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:amelia.hill@observer.co.uk\">amelia.hill@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<b> Charles Mackerras</b> <b> and</b> <b> Colin</b> <b> Davis</b> Barbican, London <p> I have nothing against youth; I tried it once, and quite enjoyed it. But let's celebrate seniority. Let's celebrate <b> Charles Mackerras</b>, who turns 75 in November; and Colin Davis, 73 a few days ago. Both conducted at the Barbican last week, and achieved the rare mix of orchestral precision and that touch of wildness which makes a performance special. </p> <p>Last Tuesday Mackerras opened the BBC Symphony Orchestra's seventieth-anniversary season with Harrison Birtwistle's Sonance Severance 2000, a clumsy title that takes almost as long to say as the piece does to play. Birtwistle wrote it for the reopening of Severance Hall in Cleveland, and it lasts about two minutes. Short, then, but not little. Birtwistle's orchestra, large and loud, transports us to that timeless zone where every thing flashes by in an instant, yet seems in a state of suspended motion. </p> <p>This exuberant fanfare begins deep in the orchestral bowels, with rumbling bass drum soon joined by double-basses and cellos. The thick textures briefly split to reveal glimpses of Debussyan clear sky, immediately obliterated by a crunching blast of raw power. In the music's dying echoes, the trumpet sounds a faltering last post. Saturated with atmosphere, the piece sets the scene: but for what? Perhaps Birtwistle's new opera, The Last Supper, which opens at Glyndebourne later this month. </p> <p>After Birtwistle's brevity, Bart\u00f3k's Concerto for Orchestra seemed discursive, if hardly long-winded. The little dance of the second movement was sardonic and sour, while the 'interrupted intermezzo' of the fourth movement had a desperate tipsiness that was most moving. To follow, Pamela Frank gave a big-boned performance of Dvor\u00e1k's Violin Concerto. Some of her phrasing was a shade sketchy, but she revelled in the virtuosity that the piece requires. </p> <p>It was in Jan\u00e1c ek's Sinfonietta that orchestra and conductor really let loose. Mackerras, of course, has been the composer's champion for half a century, but experience has not routinised his performances. There are passages in the Sinfonietta which have a rhythmic and sonic exuberance bordering on craziness, and the whole orchestra played with the energy of the possessed. This was the BBCSO's first concert at the Barbican since adopting the hall as its new 'home', and it made a hell of a house-warming. </p> <p>I don't think <b> Colin Davis</b> matched that the following day, but he came close. If Jan\u00e1c ek is Mackerras's first love, then Berlioz is Davis's, and here he continued his year-long Berlioz Odyssey with the London Symphony Orchestra. Yuri Bashmet, the viola soloist in Berlioz's Harold in Italy, played the opening movement with the brakes on, impeding the forward momentum. At times he coarsened his tone to exaggerated effect, yet elsewhere he found the requisite subtlety, investing the slenderest thread of sound with an aching poignancy. </p> <p>The Symphonie Fantastique followed, a performance hindered by squawks from the PA system outside the auditorium, so intrusive that Davis had to break off the third movement and begin again. Fortunately the LSO soon re-established the mood, the strings in particular playing with astonishing refinement. That third movement, with its imitation of a rustic wind-band, can seem arch, but the 'March to the Scaffold' was riotous, while the 'Dream of the Witches' Sabbath' had, like Mackerras's Jan\u00e1c ek, a touch of madness. While they may not be growing old disgracefully, Davis and Mackerras still have fire in their bellies.</p>",
  "<p>As the New England leaves were turning to gold in the autumn of 1975, an exclusive enclave of Greenwich, Connecticut, was stung to its pampered core by a crime that could, surely, have been committed only by an intruder to its world of yacht clubs, careful etiquette and restrained power. </p> <p>Martha Moxley, an effervescent blonde teenager, was horribly bludgeoned to death with a golf club and dumped in the garden of her parents' house in Belle Haven. She had been struck so hard that the shaft of the club broke into four pieces, only three of which were discovered at the scene of the crime. The grip, which might have had the fingerprints of the murderer on it, has never been found. The killer used one of the pieces, which had a sharp point, as a dagger and stabbed Martha through her neck. </p> <p>For years, her killer was barely sought and never found. Only after a quarter of a century did the net slowly tighten to encircle and finally entrap the man now accused of the murder: Michael Skakel, a neighbour of the dead child and high-society heir to one of the most prestigious fortunes in America, related by marriage to the Kennedy family. But that is just the prologue to the story of intrigue that surrounds the death of Martha Moxley. </p> <p>The tale itself is a tragic, gruesome, blue-blooded murder story at a hub which connects the spokes in the turning wheel of American power. The Kennedys, the Lewinsky scandal, the super-rich of Atlantic seaboard, the O.J. Simpson trial and more: almost every drama that has hallmarked America's recent past is there, stitched into a ghastly, painfully unfolding narrative. </p> <p>But even more intriguing than the story is the man who spent the past 10 years piecing it together, and why he did so. Dominick Dunne is an author and journalist who occupies a curious position - a blend of jester and ringmaster - at the heart of the American establishment, which he views through the lenses of his round, owlish spectacles like no one since since Truman Capote. The difference between the two men is that Capote was, as Dunne says, 'Inside, Inside', which is why he was in the end spat out. Dunne describes himself as 'Inside, Outside', which makes it strange that the celebrities of America feel compelled to embrace a fellow so potentially dangerous to their own reputations. </p> <p>Dunne knows everyone who is anyone, and they know him. He is living proof of the fact that celebrity is contagious. He has met so many celebrities he has become one himself. But in the story of Martha Moxley, Dunne demonstrates something else - his position is at the centre of a village green around which the supposedly far-flung dramatis personae of America's lambent high -life turns out to be huddled with intimate, indeed, claustrophobic, proximity. And that when one of their own does something appalling, they gather round... </p> <p>Although, like the Kennedys he came to know, he comes from a rich, Catholic Irish-American family, Dunne never had a silver spoon in his mouth. His life, which he himself describes as 'a very strange thing to have lived and be living', has been punctuated by pivotal moments of doubt and crisis. None has been more cogent or heartbreaking than that which has haunted him 'almost every minute' since it happened: the murder almost 20 years ago of his daughter, Dominique. </p> <p>'Everything in my life,' says Dunne, perched on the edge of a sofa in his apartment on the Upper East Side, 'stems from that.' And nothing more so than his interest in the hunt for the murderer of Martha Moxley. </p> <p>Dunne and the Moxley killing found each other as though they were waiting for each other. In 1991, Dunne was reporting for Vanity Fair on the trial, for rape, of William Kennedy Smith. This was an odd thing for him to be doing, since he had been a guest at Bobby Kennedy's wedding to Ethel Skakel in 1950, having befriended the Kennedy family through school connections on the Atlantic seaboard, and shared beach holidays with them in California. He was, in short, a family friend. </p> <p>During the trial, Dunne heard a rumour that 'Willie' had been a guest at the Skakel household in Belle Haven on the night of Martha Moxley's murder. The Skakel children, six unruly boys and a girl, were Willie's cousins. Their rich, widowed father, Rushton Skakel, was Ethel Kennedy's brother. The siblings had a wild reputation and a few of them, including Michael and Tommy, drank a good deal, although they were only teenagers. Tommy, then 17, was the last person to be seen with Martha on the night of her murder and had been considered a suspect for years. A golf club belonging to his dead mother, Ann Reynolds Skakel, had been used as the murder weapon, but no charges had ever been brought and the case was at a standstill. </p> <p>In the end, the rumour turned out to be false: Willie Smith had not been at the Skakel house in Greenwich the night Martha was killed. But Dunne's curiosity was aroused. 'Whatever happened to that case?' he recalls asking someone he knew in Greenwich. 'Nothing,' he was told. Dunne found himself wondering what had become of the dead child's mother, Dorthy Moxley. 'Somehow, I felt drawn to this woman,' he says. </p> <p>He wrote to her and they arranged to meet at a coffee bar in Baltimore airport, near where she was living. Dorthy was media-shy at the time and suspicious of a plan that Dunne had developed to base loosely a novel on her daughter's murder. He told her it might turn a spotlight on the dormant case. 'I also told her,' he says with understatement, 'that I, too, was the parent of a murdered daughter.' Their daughters had been born a year apart, and each was viciously attacked by a man she knew on 30 October, although in different years. </p> <p>That moment marked the beginning of Dunne's friendship with Dorthy: she said, yes, he could write the book. 'No one can understand Dorthy Moxley's pain like I can,' says Dunne. 'She didn't know it when she agreed to meet me but our eyes met, I told her my story, and we got it. And we'll never lose it, she's a friend, a friend for life'. </p> <p> Dunne's daughter Dominique was a fledgling and successful actress, best known for her role in Poltergeist, when she was strangled to death in 1983 by her boyfriend, John Sweeney, who feared that she was rejecting him. Sweeney successfully argued that the murder had been a crime of passion and was sentenced to two-and-a-half years for manslaughter. </p> <p>After the trial, 'I felt a madness growing in me,' says Dunne. 'I was filled with sorrow and rage, and that rage became my life. I hired private detectives to follow him. I was immersed in crazy thoughts about him and about her every second of my life. But then, one day, I decided that I cannot live like this; it'll destroy me. I realised that I had to have the talent to do something else with this'. </p> <p>At the time, he was beginning to make it in New York as a writer. He found an editor, Tina Brown at Vanity Fair, who believed in him and took him on to write an account first of Sweeney's trial, and then those of other suspected murderers and villains: the Menendez brothers, O.J. Simpson, Claus von Bulow, and many more. It was in Martha Moxley, however, that he found the story he needed. </p> <p>Dunne counselled her mother in what he himself had learned: 'I told her how I had made myself deal with this. Not in rage, or in despair, but in actually doing something. My daughter's death changed my life; it is the worst thing that can happen to anyone. But it did not destroy it. That is what I told her.' </p> <p>In this respect, Dunne's involvement in the Moxley case goes way beyond beyond luck and coincidence, of course - but also beyond journalism, especially American journalism, of which the very notion of neutrality is a sacred bedrock. 'I am a mover and a shaker in this story,' he admits with defiance. 'I am not the writer of this story, I am a player. I was a part of the story from the beginning, I made it happen, and I'll get criticised for that. But I don't care'. </p> <p> A Season in Purgatory, Dunne's novel based on the case, which blamed Martha's murder squarely on a thinly disguised Skakel, was published two years after his first meeting with Dorthy Moxley. It quickly became a best-seller and TV news networks carried stories about how it had helped revive interest in a 1975 murder case. Martha Moxley was back in the headlines. </p> <p>People with new evidence started to come forward almost at once, and presented themselves not to the police but to Dunne, who had begun to appear on television quite often, talking about Martha's murder. During a publicity tour for the book, he was approached by a forensic psychologist who had been hired early on by Greenwich police to act on the case. She told him that Tommy Skakel, until then the major suspect, was not the murderer. Dunne, too, had thought Tommy was guilty and had said so on television. 'She repeated it: \"It wasn't Tommy\". Her words haunted me,' Dunne says. </p> <p>The woman also showed him the autopsy photographs of Martha's body. One of the blows to her head had been so severe it had removed part of her scalp, which then hung over her face by a piece of skin. Propelled by the horror of what he saw, Dunne contacted the police in Connecticut to try and whip the case back to life, without success. They said the forensic psychologist had stolen the photographs. </p> <p>Two years later, the book was turned into a high-grade television mini-series and soon after it was broadcast, a young university graduate, whose identity Dunne protects, called him and, over lunch, related the contents of a private detective agency's report into the murder commissioned in 1991 by Rushton Skakel at a cost of some $750,000. </p> <p>Through a friend, the graduate had got the job of putting the detectives' findings into a narrative form. Rushton had wanted to take the spotlight of suspicion off his sons. But the report suggested that while Tommy had not killed Martha Moxley, the murderer could have been his brother, Michael. There was also a suggestion that Tommy may have helped him move Martha's body. </p> <p>This was ironic; the report which the old man had commissioned in the hope that it would exonerate his dear sons instead ended up implicating them. Rushton Skakel took it badly. An acknowledged alcoholic, he had already been devastated by the death of his wife from cancer two years before Martha's murder and, as a result, had struggled to keep his wayward, over-privileged offspring in line. This must have seemed the final blow. Rushton stashed the report away and it was never heard of until the young graduate handed it to Dominick Dunne. </p> <p>'I have,' Dunne reflects, 'the kind of life in which events seem to follow me around. I didn't go looking for this, it found me. I didn't go looking for those autopsy papers, they came to me. I didn't go looking for the Sutton report, some kid just called me up.' </p> <p>The next unsolicited call to Dunne introduced two further spheres of American drama into the narrative - one in Dunne's past. Lucianne Goldberg is best known nowadays as the woman who urged Linda Tripp to tape Monica Lewinsky's outpourings about her affair with President Clinton. But at that time, she was a literary agent Dunne had befriended. </p> <p>Goldberg represented Mark Fuhrman, the detective disgraced as a supposed racist during the O.J. Simpson trial, but whom Dunne nevertheless admired and had defended in print. Goldberg wanted to help Fuhrman, and Dunne decided that Fuhrman was exactly what was needed to prize open the Moxley murder case. </p> <p>Dunne's hunch about Fuhrman was a good one. Fuhrman pursued the case with a couple of accomplices. Grotesque details emerged: Michael Skakel, who had a perverse crush on Martha Moxley, apparently used to masturbate at her window, and even relieved himself over her corpse. Working with such material, as part of this new troika, Fuhrman produced a book called Murder in Greenwich, to which Dunne wrote an introduction, which in turn caused a grand jury to be called, to hear and question Michael Skakel. </p> <p> Dunne believes an upper-class conspiracy of silence protected Skakel for years and continues to do so. 'I believe that many people who lived in Belle Haven back then know things about the murder that they haven't told.' </p> <p>Last winter, he was stopped on the Upper East Side by a man who told him he used to be a friend of Michael Skakel's. He told Dunne that Skakel told him he was so drunk on the night of the murder he didn't remember whether he'd done it or not. When Dunne asked him his name, he walked away. Just three months ago, a woman came up to him in a bookshop in Vermont and told him that she was from Greenwich and knew where the grip of the golf club which had killed Martha was hidden. 'She said a lot of people in Greenwich know, but then she refused to talk further and walked out of the shop.' </p> <p>At the hearings earlier this year, the young heirs to the Kennedy name staked their reputation on a staunch defence of Michael Skakel. Skakel had looked after a foundation called the Citizens' Energy Foundation for Michael Kennedy after his brother, Joseph, commandeered him to be campaign manager in a possible run for the governorship of Massachusetts. Skakel had been a driver in the re-election campaign of the dynasty's patriarch, Teddy Kennedy, in 1994. Robert Kennedy Jnr had, three days before Skakel's indictment, accused Dunne of mounting a vendetta against Skakel and Fuhrman of financial greed. In the New York Times, he called Michael Skakel 'as honest as daylight... a genuinely good and decent soul'. And on 28 June, he went into court to insist he was not guilty. </p> <p>Reflecting on the Kennedy entwinement with both his own life and the Moxley case, Dunne can only say: 'Well, I went to the same school as Jack; I went to Bobby Kennedy and Ethel Skakel's wedding because we all knew each other from the beach and I was dating a friend of Ethel's. Then there we all were in court in Florida for Willie's trial; I was sitting across the aisle from the family. We lowered our eyes, we couldn't ever look at each other. Then they all come back again, in the Moxley murder.' </p> <p>While the Kennedys were defending their cousin before the grand jury, Michael Skakel sobbed. Who knows whether his were tears of rage or remorse. The judge ruled that there were probable grounds for suspicion that Skakel was Martha Moxley's murderer and that case should be sent for trial. Originally scheduled for this summer, it was postponed and a new date has yet to be set. But Dunne's work is done. 'Whatever happens next is up to the law,' he says in conversation, 'I have played my part.' </p> <p>Like the Skakels and Kennedys, the Dunne family had been cursed by tragedy before Dominique was murdered. Two of the five children born to Dunne and his wife, Lenny, died in infancy. Lenny herself is disabled. But you would not think, to look at him now, that such a past haunts Dunne. There is something dandyish about him, something fin-de-si\u00e8cle , with his puckish smile, small frame and immaculate suit and tie. </p> <p>No wonder the likes of Princess Diana, Gianni Versace and his mentor, Tina Brown, were entranced. But thinly veiled beneath Dunne's charm, perfect, whipped-cream manners and that kindly gaze is a layer of reinforced platinum, the kind one only acquires through knowing tragedy from the inside, whatever face you show the world, and even if you are, as he admits to being, 'a complete tart when it comes to going to parties'. </p> <p>'Most people have a turning point in their lives,' he says, 'and the murder of my daughter was mine. But there have been others, several in fact. I was 18 when they sent me into the Battle of the Bulge, and I saved someone's life. I was a scared little boy in that war, and that had a major effect on me. I didn't talk about it for years and years. I buried it deep - but I think the experience told me that I had something'. </p> <p>After the war came Hollywood, where he was a television and feature-film producer, but after Hollywood came deep depression, acute problems with alcohol and a seminal six months living in a log cabin in Oregon, which Dunne now calls the 'really important time, when I realised what was important in life, and what was not - by asking what all this bullshit in life in Hollywood was really doing for me'. He moved to New York in 1980, then, just as he was beginning to make it in New York, came the most devastating blow of all, the death of his daughter. </p> <p>Dunne's books and journalism are superficially glitzy, but deep down, he composes dark morality plays. The very notion of this makes him clap his hands and clasp one of mine. 'They are about right and wrong, good and evil,' he says, excited at the brute simplicity of his own formula. 'They're about good people and bad people.' Does this come from a Catholic upbringing? 'No,' he says, 'it comes from the murder of my daughter.' </p> <p>There is more than morality at play in the Moxley murder story, and in Dunne's other books and reports for Vanity Fair. For all that he likes to stack his prestigious invitation cards along the mantelpiece, there is an earthy, Irishman's sense of democracy within. 'I hate to see people getting away with things because of who they are,' he says. 'I hate to see cops get lazy and Michael Skakel rise above suspicion just because he was rich.' </p> <p>Dominick Dunne has a keen eye for the case of JonBenet Ramsey, the six-year-old beauty queen murdered in Colorado. He has not, yet, turned his pen to this case but he is angered by what he sees as the preferential treatment of the prime suspects, JonBenet's parents. </p> <p>'There's a grand jury,' fumes Dunne with a rare loss of composure, 'and they are called to testify. Now, I don't know if they murdered her or not, but they're the prime suspects and they don't even have to appear. They get to do it all by video, only because they are rich. Well, that's something that would never happen to a black family.' </p> <p>Dunne's next novel will, he says, 'be my last. I have written some good books but not a great book and I think I have it in me to write one great novel, if that's not too pompous. I can't imagine winding down, but I'm 75 next month, I have prostate cancer, and have to accept realities'. It will feature the same cast as his book, People Like Us, which was set among the New York glitterati wherein he circulates, and which both loves and fears him. </p> <p>'Inside but outside,' he ponders. 'I've always been like that. It can be done. What happened to Truman Capote was that he got inside the establishment and tried to stay. It's just a place to visit. The thing is, I never betrayed anyone. People know that I know more about them than I write, and that I never write it. That's what Truman Capote did - he wrote it all, he betrayed people. I write tough, but I never write mean.'</p>",
  "<p>A couple of hundred metres along from the Medici Palace in Florence, the narrow street becomes Via de' Pucci. To the right, you can see the dome of the city's great cathedral. As you fight through the crowds of American tour groups in their shorts, their video cameras at the ready, you enter a huge gated entrance. The wrought-iron gates at the other side of the passageway are locked, but you can see through into a rich courtyard.</p> <p>There is a coat of arms above the doorway, the silhouette of a Moor's head in profile. It is the symbol of the Pucci family, fashion house since the 1950s, and influential Florentine family since the 14th century when they were political advisors to the Medicis. This huge stone building is the Pucci Palazzo, the family seat and home to Cristina Pucci, wife and muse of the late Emilio Pucci, who founded the fashion business, and her daughter, Laudomia, who took over the management of the business after her father died in 1992. Next door is the home of Puccio Pucci, Emilio's elderly brother. And at the end of the block is another palazzo that once belonged to the Puccis and is now the property of the church. Two windows at the end are bricked up, as they have been since two members of the Pucci family tried to kill a passing Medici a couple of centuries ago. The rebel Puccis were hung and the windows, so the story goes, have been bricked up ever since. </p> <p>A doorman opens the reception door and we are ushered up a grand staircase, lined with the odd marble bust along the way. 'Laudomia Pucci will be with you shortly.' And we take a seat on the sumptuous, blue damask, gilded chairs and wait. This is the gallery, lined with Old Masters and a display cabinet filled with crests and awards given to Emilio for his achievements as an athlete. The ceilings tower above, with fabulous Murano glass chandeliers suspended from them. Through a doorway we can just glimpse the ballroom, laid out with tables and chairs and more statues, and another family crest.</p> <p>It is so inordinately splendid that it would not be at all surprising if Laudomia made her entrance wearing a ballgown, the taffeta swishing around as she walked. As it is, a slight, smiling woman appears, wearing black jeans and a lime- green suede zip-front jacket, lined with just a flash of Pucci print. On her feet are a pair of flat sandals with the sparkle of jewels across a single strap. Around her neck is a chunky, pale jade necklace, a present from her husband. She is not feeling great, she says. She caught a cold from her two young children and is a bit under the weather. </p> <p>Her office is a small room with a view out onto the street below. On the window ledge are two photographs, one of Tony and Cherie Blair with a note thanking Laudomia for her hospitality. This summer, the Blairs visited the Puccis for lunch at the family's country home. Laudomia was at the beach when she received a call to say they were on their way and ran off to the local shop to buy bread, cheese, salami and beer for lunch. The other picture is of Hillary Clinton, with a note thanking Laudomia for a book she had sent to her. Despite her cold, Laudomia is obviously in high spirits. 'This deal with LVMH is the best thing I have done,' she says. 'I haven't slept this well for six months.' </p> <p>Last February, the all-powerful French luxury goods group that owns everything from Louis Vuitton, Givenchy and Christian Dior to Celine and Loewe, bought a 67 per cent stake in the privately owned Pucci. The remaining 33 per cent is still held by the family. The sale means new investment in the fashion house, a brand new distribution network, global marketing plans and a string of new shops to be opened over the next 12 months. Today, the first one opens on Milan's Via Montenapoleone. Before Christmas, two more will be added to the list, one on Palm Beach, and the other in St Moritz. Others are planned for strategic spots - the Bellagio Hotel, perhaps, in LA, or a little boutique in Capri. By mid-October, the brand will be available online too, with a page on LVMH's e-luxury.com website. Since the early 90s, when Pucci enjoyed a brief revival, the brand has been a sleeping lion. Now LVMH is rattling the cage. </p> <p>A new president has been installed in one of the grand reception rooms of the palazzo. Catherine Vautrin was formerly director of ready-to-wear at Louis Vuitton, the luxury label that has been given a new lease of life by designer Marc Jacobs. 'The challenge is not to change Pucci,' she says, 'but to bring Pucci back to the front row. The archives of prints are amazing. What is known of Pucci is really the tip of the iceberg.' The house is on the hunt for a creative director. Vautrin expects to make an announcement by the end of the month. One name that has been rumoured for the job is Antonio Berardi. He has been secretly consulting on the womenswear for the past three seasons. </p> <p>Laudomia has been repositioned as image director. 'To understand a brand you have to understand the roots,' says Vautrin. 'I cannot think of a better person who can speak so well about her father, both as a man, but also as a designer, an artist, as a contributor to modern fashion.' And Laudomia has a strong sense of how she would like to see the brand move forward. 'When I came into the picture, there was this extraordinary man with his visions and his ideas, with his following and with enormous respect from the industry,' she recalls. 'But it wasn't really a structured business - it was a genius's business.'</p> <p>Since her father's death, Laudomia has been slowly building and learning. 'It's very difficult when you come into a company that's 40 years old, with all the habits of one genius person, and you're the daughter of an aristocrat, living in a palazzo, who doesn't have to work. You're not necessarily taken seriously.' She has been encouraged and supported by some of her loyal customers, however. 'We did it in a very low-profile, simple, hard-working way, and then we noticed that demand was growing and we could improve and that we needed professionals. We started hiring a PR and a designer. Now it's the right time in history; it's a merger-and-acquisition moment in fashion. Everybody is consolidating. We are lucky that colour is in fashion. If you're in the right place at the right time, things happen. We were there at the right time.' </p> <p>In pure fashion terms, Pucci could not have wished for a better moment to be reborn. Laudomia puts it all down to the economy; when things are prosperous, women wear bright colours and bold patterns. The collections for this autumn, from catwalk to chain store, are packed with Pucci references. Every fashion magazine is carrying a print story, not least because Tom Ford of Gucci took inspiration from the Florentine prince of prints, as did Donatella Versace. On the high street, there are copies of Gucci doing Pucci. The swirly, psychedelic and precise geometric prints have even crept on to tights and accessories, and into the world of interiors, too. The world has gone potty for Pucci.</p> <p>Laudomia is surprisingly cool about the fact that her father's prints have become the basis for so many others: 'Now that people see a big splash of print and say it's a Pucci or a Versace interpretation of Pucci, or a Gucci interpretation of Pucci, or whatever, they know where it's coming from and we've got the message through. I've got great admiration for Tom: whatever he does he's got his own vision, and Pucci has its own - two different people; two different companies.' </p> <p>One of the things that attracted LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault to Pucci was the history of the family. There aren't many fashion houses whose headquarters are in a historical palazzo, a stone's throw from the Duomo and the Uffizi in Florence, with an entire archive intact, along with a story of a genius aristocrat who lived to make women look beautiful.</p> <p>'Very clearly, Mr Arnault likes the concept of tradition,' says Laudomia. 'That's what he told me. He told me we represent something, that we belong here.' It is not often a businessman gets the opportunity to buy into history, and into a family with money as old as it gets. The Puccis live in a world that goes right off the luxury scale. Ralph Lauren can fantasise about Scottish castles to his heart's content. The Puccis actually live the life.</p> <p>For her 39th birthday treat the day after our interview, Laudomia had asked for a simple present from her husband: a pot of caviar to be enjoyed with her family in the countryside. It is the sort of fabulous luxury where money is incidental. 'What has intrigued Mr Arnault,' she continues, 'is that money can buy so much, and yet it is the history here, the tradition. And it's alive. That is the backbone of this story. Sometimes you might have such a story, but it's an 85-year-old lady telling it, and not someone who's got a two-year-old child, a real woman living in the real world. If Pucci had been without us, the palace, and the whole story, it would have been another thing.' </p> <p>The story of Emilio Pucci begins in 1914, with the birth in Naples of the baby Marquis of Barsento. Emilio's parents were Orazio Pucci and the countess Augusta Pavoncelli, from one of the oldest families of Florence. The young Marquis was sent to study sociology in America, then became a pilot in the Italian air force. He was an accomplished athlete and a keen skier. In 1947, he produced his first design: a man's ski suit - a hooded print jacket with stretch ski pants. The suit was photographed by American Toni Frissell of Harper's Bazaar , who showed it to the fashion diva Diana Vreeland. 'She saw the picture,' says Laudomia, 'and put my father in touch with a company called White Stag in Oregon, to produce a winter collection for Lord &amp; Taylor.' </p> <p>It all happened quite by accident. But from that moment, Emilio Pucci had the beginnings of a business. Strangely, however, Pucci is not remembered for his skiwear, but for his brightly patterned dresses, shirts and pants, worn by the jet set as they holidayed in chichi resorts. Around 1949, he opened a boutique in Capri, then a simple fishing village where 'the beautiful people' liked to go. At the time, fashion was as formal as a Dior cocktail dress. They came from an atelier in Paris or were made by a seamstress at home. Pucci saw a need for a holiday wardrobe, and his boutique, selling simple shapes in bright patterns, was a revolution. The Americans loved it and, eventually, the Italians, who weren't quite sure about an aristocrat lowering himself to design clothes, caught on, too. </p> <p>In America, Pucci was big business. In 1960, Pucci introduced his 'Emilioform' clothing - casual separates in a blend of shantung silk and nylon. It meant an evening gown could be rolled up into a little bag, and be worn without a single crease. As well as selling in Lord &amp; Taylor and Neiman Marcus, the company opened a store in New York which, along with a small boutique in Florence, near the palazzo, have been the only two Pucci shops in the world, making the label a well-kept secret. Marilyn Monroe wore Pucci to seduce Arthur Miller. Lauren Bacall wore Pucci, as did Elizabeth Taylor, Audrey Hepburn and Gina Lollobrigida. In Paris, Salvador and Gala Dali were treated to private shows. And the great thing about Pucci was that the shapes were simple and elegant and the prints totally timeless. </p> <p>In the 50s and 60s, Pucci appeared to be working in parallel with the pop and op artists. But according to Laudomia, modern art was of no interest to him. 'He loved Old Masters, so for him modern art was absolute baloney. But he was totally part of the modern art movement. That is very funny, because he did not really like anything modern. He loved what he did. He didn't see anything else. It sounds improper now when I say he didn't like modern art, but it wasn't his aesthetic. Renaissance art was his thing. His work was a reinterpretation of the old.' </p> <p>In the ballroom of the palazzo, where Pucci first showed his collections before the ready-to-wear shows began in Milan, a series of busts of Roman emperors surrounds the room. They have been painted in the Pucci palette of emerald greens and ruby reds, a merry prank typical of Emilio's irreverent sense of humour. Laudomia began working with her father from the age of 23, after she finished university.</p> <p>'As a child you know what you see, and what you see is normal,' she says. 'So that is how I think it's been relatively easy for me to pass on this message and keep it going because it is part of my upbringing, part of my language, part of my aesthetics, part of my genes. The logics of prints and colour are like a language, and that is probably what I've learnt most from my father. This balance of colours, and of movement in his prints is what I think I can really relate to.' But she is well aware that it is not enough any more to have an archive of prints, however historic. 'The world has changed,' she says. 'We're talking about a mass culture of luxury. Everybody travels today. So when you call it a jet-set society you are talking about an elite society. Today, everybody's jet setting. There is mass luxury.' </p> <p>Emilio had already cast his vision beyond clothes. He designed carpets - there are several bright rugs dotted around the palazzo, including Laudomia's own apartment within the palazzo, a light, modern, place. From the terrace, you can almost touch the Duomo. Inside, there are ceramics, cushion covers, towels and curtains, all with Emilio's mark. A Christian Liaigre sofa is covered in Pucci fabric. In the children's room (Laudomia has two children: Tancredi, two, and Larissa, four) toys are wrapped in bags covered with Pucci print. In his lifetime, Emilio had developed the fashion line into accessories, perfume, handbags, a home line and perfume. It's just that the curtains and cushions were made for the palazzo, and the carpets were in a tiny limited edition. But the potential for growth is obvious. </p> <p>Next year, Fondazione Emilio Pucci will open on the Palazzo Pucci's ground floor, with exhibitions and a research centre. It will be another stop on the tourists' schedule. Pucci is ready and waiting. And the marketing men and women at LVMH are going to move quickly, to spread a lot of luxury a little more thinly so we can all share a piece of it. 'It just needs an enormous amount of help,' says Laudomia. 'It's all there,' she says, and with all the pride of daddy's little girl, whispers, 'It's a little jewel, you know?'</p> <p>\u0095 Pucci's autumn/winter collection is available from Browns, 23-27 South Molton Street, London W1 (020 7491 7833); and Joseph, 77 Fulham Road, London SW3 (020 7590 6200); Harvey Nichols, Knightsbridge, London SW1 (020 7235 5000)</p>"
