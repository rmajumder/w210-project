[
  "<p>Lembit Opik had a good day at the office yesterday. Perhaps it was the sensual contours of his hand-made leather in-tray that did it, or the way the luxurious (and luxuriously priced) carpet caressed his shoes; or the way the light in the atrium glinted off the water in the fountain. Either way, the Liberal Democrat MP for Montgomeryshire - usually perceived as a man of rather more apocalyptic temperament, given his role as a key voice in the campaign to warn the world of the catastrophic consequences of being hit by a meteorite - certainly enjoyed his first day at work in what is, yard for yard, Britain's most expensive, and arguably most contentious office building, Portcullis House. \"Despite all the controversy, it feels good and I think it will feel good for our visitors,\" he says of the new Westminster home for 210 MPs. \"And it did feel great walking into the building.\" </p> <p>Once upon a time, the opulent office could be justified - if it needed to be justified at all - on the old-fashioned principles of conspicuous consumption: who could doubt the power and credibility of a government - or a bank, or a management consultancy - that could afford to transform countless tonnes of marble and gleaming steel into a vast, mortality-defying, space-wasting monument to corporate might? But in an age of efficiency, the more likely rationalisation speaks of the need to attract the best talent; to provide them with airy cathedrals in which to worship the god of productivity. Which rather prompts the question: do they work? </p> <p>Luxury has always been a critical part of the subtle lines of power that crisscross every office floor: used aggressively, the ostentatious demonstration of opulence can be wonderfully flattering - or absolutely terrifying. \"The chief executive's office was amazing: awesome mahogany, indescribably deep carpets,\" recalls a former employee of a major London bank. \"If you were summoned, you knew it was because you were pretty special - or because you were in for a serious dressing-down.\" But whether the marble and the gurgling fountains actually make a serious difference to workplace morale and productivity - whether, in other words, Lembit Opik and his fellow MPs would be one iota less effective in their work if a few thousand pounds less had been spent on the office carpet - seems rather more questionable. </p> <p>Those who have worked in similarly plush environments testify to the little jolt of happiness - of being wanted - that hit them every time they showed up for work. \"Every day I worked in that building I walked through the doors and thought: this feels good ,\" says one City worker. \"You walked off the street and immediately you felt special,\" another recalls. </p> <p>Yet complacency settles in pretty fast, even in palaces such as the notorious European Bank of Reconstruction and Development near London's Liverpool Street, where a \u00a366m marble-heavy refurbishment earned it the epithet \"the Glistening Bank\" and was a key factor in the resignation of its president, Jacques Attali. At one point, more had been spent on revamping the office than on the projects the bank had been established to support. \"There was a lot of marble - it was real Bonfire of the Vanities stuff,\" one former employee recalls. \"But, hey - you got used to it.\" </p> <p>Organisational psychologists don't buy the luxury-productivity link either (although that might just be jealousy). \"There are hygiene factors and motivating factors,\" says Dr Rob Yeung, a business psychologist at the consultancy Kiddy and Partners. \"Hygiene factors are things like having a sufficiently warm office, access to food, drink, shelter - the physiological needs. Once these are satisfied, they no longer actually motivate any further or produce greater performance or quality of thought or things like that. Pay, even, is quite often described as a hygiene factor: once people are paid enough to live OK and go on a few holidays, it doesn't actually motivate people to work any harder.\" </p> <p>Forget deep-pile carpets and deeper leather armchairs: quality relationships and control over one's working environment - however grotty - matter more. \"The kind of things that make people work harder are feeling valued, feeling like their efforts are recognised, having a good working relationship with colleagues, customers and suppliers, and feeling their needs for achievement are being met in the workplace.\" </p> <p> Luxurious surroundings \"can make people feel good about themselves, but can have a rebound effect,\" says Dr Valerie Lamont, a chartered counselling psychologist. \"In some people, it creates a sense of 'What am I doing here? This doesn't feel like a comfortable place to work', particularly if there is any discrepancy between the image of the office and the actual working practices.\" </p> <p>Then there is the famous \"lobby factor\" - the predictable tendency for spacious grandeur to be rapidly replaced by low-ceilinged, fluorescent-lit squalor the moment employees pass from the public areas to the private offices. \"The lobby was full of marble and chrome and big fountains with goldfish and lovely plants,\" is a typical observation. \"The communal areas were lovely, but the actual offices were horrid. I had to leave because there was a real culture of terror, backstabbing and bullying that was so awful, the lobby frankly wasn't going to keep me.\" </p> <p>There is, in any case, something almost embarrassingly old-fashioned about Portcullis House's approach to luxury - the armchairs with snooze buttons, the notorious fig trees. The new economy it ain't: ask any of the burgeoning ranks of edgy, up-to-the-minute office designers to work you up a symphony in marble and cascading fountains, and they would drop their laptops in horror. </p> <p>\"Ten years ago, maybe,\" says Arnold Levin, director of the Center for Workplace Innovation, a Washington DC-based office design firm. \"Then, the law firms we designed for would always be opulent; always stone, wood, marble. But even our law firm clients, though they spend a bit more than our dot.com startups, are very concerned that their clients don't get the impression their fees are being poured into the workplace. Across the board, there's so much more money being spent on technology and wiring and cabling that opulence is the last thing on anybody's mind.\" </p> <p>Back at Portcullis House, in his deluxe third-floor office, however, Lembit Opik is understandably keen to emphasise the productivity benefits of all that spending. \"There has been a dramatic improvement in the work environment - it's acoustically well-designed, natural light is used well - it feels good, and that's got to be good for productivity ... It makes very good sense for the long term.\" And perhaps there are other advantages: if a meteorite does ever hurtle from the heavens and land on London, maybe the carpet at Portcullis House will break its fall.</p>",
  "<p>When Richard Branson jumps into, or off, a moving object, it is easy to see the activity as a publicity stunt for his businesses, building up his image as trusted buccaneer. But PR isn't what drives him. The same spirit that makes him an entrepreneur, a corporate risk-taker, drives him to daredevil activities in his leisure time. And the more on-edge his business life, the more dangerous his out-of-hours pursuits are likely to be because the way we work impacts enormously on the way we play. Air traffic controllers are much more likely to have challenging hobbies, such as rock-climbing, than civil servants, who are keener on a game of chess. We carry our work-shaped traits into the rest of our lives. </p> <p>Of course, it is possible that we simply choose jobs and hobbies that suit our personalities. But there is good evidence that the nature of our work has an influence on what we do after we clock off. The sociologist Stanley Parker tracked workers over a six-year period and found that those whose jobs had become more passive had become more passive in their leisure hours (TV watching increased, for example), while workers in jobs that had become more active took up more stimulating leisure pursuits. Work maketh the man. </p> <p>All of which makes even more worrying the recent comments by Labour MP Tess Kingham on the working culture of the House of Commons. She describes the worst part of the job as \"hanging around a dank, dark, claustrophobic place until 2am\" and the whipping process as \"an appalling, bullying system\" which supports \"schoolboy politics\". The pettiness of the systems and debates has driven her away: she is standing down at the next election. </p> <p>We often criticise our politicians for being bullies, egomaniacs, in love with the sound of their own voices, full of petty jealousies and generally socially dysfunctional - and assume these are the traits that made them go into politics. Perhaps, though, it is the absurd nature of the work that creates the absurd natures of many politicians. </p> <p>At the other end of the occupational scale, Joanne Ciulla, a US academic, cites bingo as an example of the work-leisure link. Bingo is most popular among workers with low-skilled, production line jobs - disproportionately women. Ciulla points out the eerie similarities between bingo and routine work: \"It is played in a large hall and the players sit at tables in rows. There is a caller and a 'supervisor'. Players ... 'work' through their card and if it goes well they get paid. The supervisor designates periods for refreshment. There is no skill or personal challenge in the game. Bingo allows for socialising, but that, too, is somewhat limited by the nature of the game.\" </p> <p>If you find yourself TV-watching for long periods, it's probably time for a new job. Recruitment firms might want to set up in bingo halls. </p> <p>The umbilical cord between our work and play personas demonstrates the falsity of the division between work and home, labour and leisure. Pat Kane, the former pop singer and social commentator, has called for a new \"play ethic\" to replace the obsolete work version, arguing that we need to rediscover creativity, freedom, fun. He's right that we need a more playful philosophy of life - but he is wrong to counterpoise work and play. His call for a 35-hour week is based on an assumption that work cannot be playful, when it can and should be. Indeed, a fun and friendly environment consistently tops polls of what workers want from their jobs. </p> <p>The play ethic is a great idea, but we won't get it by corralling work into a corner of our lives and treating it as the penance we pay for our hours of fun. If work is drudgery, chances are the rest of our lives will be, too. The point is to inject play into work, not take it away. As self-styled \"philosopher for the proletariat\" Bob Black puts it: \"You are what you do. The problem is that if you do boring, stupid, monotonous work, chances are you'll end up boring, stupid and monotonous.\" </p> <p><strong> Filthy lucre</strong></p> <p>Gordon Brown is a crusader for \"full and fulfilling\" employment, and has called for better working conditions for all Britain's workers. But at the Treasury, magnet for the brightest and best of Whitehall's workers, it seems that some have failed to take his message to heart. On the wall of a Treasury toilet is the following sign: \"To the person who is wiping excrement on the cubicle walls/floors. This is disgusting. Please have some respect for your fellow workers.\" Disgusting indeed. Still, where there's muck ...</p>",

  "<p>The Maben-Mead family have been waiting a long time to fly to Australia, but later this week they will finally leave. After a massive fundraising effort, Jill Maben and Robert Mead are taking their eight-year-old son George to Melbourne in the hope that pioneering brain surgery, not currently available in the UK, will remove a rare form of tumour and transform his quality of life. </p> <p>It is certainly not the first time that friends, family and volunteers have rallied round to support an exhausting wave of sponsored walks, jumble sales and raffles in a bid to raise thousands of pounds to cover the costs of \"miracle\" medical treatment on the other side of the world which is not offered by the NHS. American hospitals, in particular, have been marketing themselves aggressively to vulnerable British patients - particularly to candidates for brain-tumour surgery - even though the outcomes on both sides of the Atlantic have been more or less the same. </p> <p>George has a rare benign tumour, known as a hypothalamic hamartoma, deep inside his brain in the region which controls mood, appetite, thirst, sleep and hormones. The little-known condition has given him severe learning and behavioural difficulties, and up to 15 epileptic seizures a day. There is no known cure, apart from complex surgery to remove the tumour - and even that has been largely unsuccessful, under techniques used in Britain. </p> <p>Then, through an international support group on the internet, Jill and Robert learned of pioneering micro-surgery with a high success rate at the Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne. With the encouragement of the surgeons they have talked to all 12 of the previous patients, and their son is due to undergo surgery next month. </p> <p>George talks like a four-year-old and cannot read or write. His motor skills are poor, though like many people with autism - another effect of his condition - he has an amazing memory, able to recite parrot fashion all the names of his vast video collection. \"George's quality of life at the moment is already very poor,\" Robert says. \"He has no friends of his own age and no interest at all in going out or meeting other people. His world revolves around his Postman Pat and Disney videos. Without the operation, there is no doubt that his condition would deteriorate further.\" </p> <p>The normal development of George's younger sister Lola, who at 19 months is just saying her first words, makes the pain greater still. Though George attends a special school in Essex, some distance from the family's home in Hackney, east London, looking after him is so demanding that Robert has given up his job in a respite home, and spends much time teaching George in a specially-designed playroom in the family's garden. The couple raised the \u00a316,500 needed for the operation in three months, though they must still raise \u00a33,500 to cover accommodation, travel and other expenses. </p> <p>It took three years before George's condition was diagnosed. He appeared slow to develop, and did not walk until he was 18 months old; his speech, when it came at age two, was largely restricted to single words. The local clinic talked of \"general global delay\", and George was investigated for hearing loss and provided with speech therapy. But it was the first major seizure - in the middle of the night, with three of them in the bed - that sounded the alarm. </p> <p>A scan revealed a tumour, and neurologists at Great Ormond Street hospital in London said the rest of the brain appeared normal. Only then did his parents realise that George's odd, staccato-like cries as a baby - which everyone had called \"cute\" - had actually been minor seizures. </p> <p>George was born with the tumour, which grows at the same rate as his brain and is now up to 2cm across. Its presence causes him to have a very rare form of \"gelastic\" epilepsy which results in 10 to 15 \"laughing seizures\" every day as a result of constant electrical activity. </p> <p>Great Ormond Street told them George's condition was inoperable, and energies were directed towards \"symptom management\", keeping his seizures under control by regular medication. But it was a lonely and difficult time for Jill, herself trained as a nurse, who started extensive research in search of information. \"It was a relief to find that there was something there. But I remember sitting in the British Library and reading about 'cognitive decline' in relation to gelastic epilepsy. It was all extremely depressing.\" </p> <p>Next, Jill turned to the internet, and after several months traced six other families whose children had the same kind of tumour. Without treatment, George's epilepsy would be likely to worsen, possibly even leading to \"drop seizures\", where a person literally drops to the ground and risks serious injury; but with the radical Australian surgery - involving a delicate five-hour operation through a 2cm incision in the top of the head - the tumour will be removed completely and, if successful, will end the seizures while also halting learning decline. </p> <p>By the time the surgeon involved, Professor Jeffrey Rosenfeld, sees George next month, he will have operated on 12 children, all of whom are virtually seizure-free. The most recent surgery was carried out just two weeks ago. </p> <p>Jill admits that her own medical background was a help in researching the operation. \"But one of the most important things for us is being able to communicate with other families via the internet, including the 12 whose children have had the surgery in Australia,\" she says. \"Instead of feeling that we were on our own, it has been great to share the experience with so many other people. And the surgeons even sent us their own CVs. The whole thing has been a very open and transparent process.\" </p> <p>Apart from the fact that techniques used in the UK have a lower success rate - sometimes leading to complications such as strokes - NHS funding restrictions would inevitably have meant a long wait for any surgery here, and Jill and Robert do not have time on their side. \"We would rather take George to Australia where there is a proven track record and increasing experience of this very complex brain surgery and where we can get surgery immediately,\" Jill explains. </p> <p>\"We can't risk a further wait which could lead to further deterioration. There is the prospect of a very complex operation and five hours on the operating table, not to mention 26 hours on the plane, which for George is not going to be easy. This is not something we would do lightly.\" </p> <p>George's neurologist at Great Ormond Street, Professor Brian Neville, has been supportive, though he stops short of recommending the surgery. A spokeswoman for the hospital says: \"We cannot recommend this operation because it is quite a new procedure which has not had any long-term follow up. But the surgical team in Australia is very highly respected, and we fully support the right of the family to make this decision.\" </p> <p>Now, as they wait to leave, Jill and Robert are, understandably, in an emotional state. \"We are experiencing a mixture of excitement and worry,\" Jill says. \"We don't want to raise our hopes too much. But we are quite tenacious. It is the next, and ultimate step in improving George's quality of life. We could wait another five years for the surgery to be refined in this country, but that is an awfully long time in George's life.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Updates of George's progress will be posted on the web at <a href=\"http://www.gap3.com\">www.gap3.com</a>.</p>",
  "It took three and a half years to get round to, and followed increasing pressure from deeply frustrated green groups and big business. But in the end Tony Blair's first speech about the environment since taking office was little more than an emollient rallying call for everyone to come together to address what he called the most pressing and urgent problems of the day. <p>His 35-minute speech to the Confederation of British Industry and the Green Alliance was short on new initiatives - \u00a3150m over three years should marginally boost renewable technologies - but long on why Britain had to move environment up the political agenda.</p> <p>No one could disagree with the sentiment and Blair sought largely to appease increasingly warring parties. There was no contradiction, he argued, between impatient green groups and Britain's drive for prosperity, or between science and the environment. </p> <p>Urging all sectors to work together to harness science and the market to protect the environment, he suggested: \"We could be richer by being greener; and by being greener we would enrich the quality of our lives.\" In fact, he went no further than Stephen Byers, the trade and industry secretary, who has called for a green industrial revolution, or Gordon Brown, who has recognised that green taxes can penalise wrong-doers and reward companies who address environmental problems. </p> <p>But his acknowledgement that global warming was alarming, that millions face drought and disease, that population growth was still a major issue, that wetlands and forests systems were being destroyed and that the global use of resources were unsustainable, made all the right noises.</p> <p>But that was it. Vague talk about moving to a carbon-free economy: but no great change of direction; no substantial new initiatives; no new targets or timetables; nothing to worry polluting business or consumers; no tighter regulations. Just pats on the back for Michael Meacher and Stephen Byers, big business and oil companies who were, he said, getting to grip with the problems; some recognition of the role of green groups; and a pluralistic big-tent vision whereby a combination of education and sensible progress would somehow right the wrongs. </p> <p>Labour's faith in technology and prosperity to get the world out of an admitted crisis is touching, but naive. Technologies in fuel efficiency, carbon-free buildings, pollution control, waste management and environmental remediation are moving ahead fast, but almost all UN research and other indicators suggest the global and national situation is fast worsening for billions of people. Green groups such as Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth are already working successfully with business. </p> <p>For all the new talk about putting environment at the heart of government, there is little sign of the radical, specific action that almost everyone except the government recognises is needed. The money is there, the need is there, the understanding is there and so are many of the solutions. Environment has all the potential to be the Big Idea of a second Blair administration. But it remains a dream.</p>",
  "There are at points real conflict between the immediate interests of consumption and the longer term interests of the environment; and to be frank, between the politicans' need to woo the electorate a well as lead them. <p>My point is simply this. We must work at resolving these conflicts or finding a way through. And we should recognise that to be environmentally conscious isn't a punishment. It is indeed in our long term interests; and it can also be of benefit, short and medium term too. What's more there is a real concern and desire amongst our people, within realistic bounds, to do the right thing. We have children and granchildren. </p> <p>We care for them. We know that despoiling the environment today will mean hardship, even death for them tomorrow. Call it idealism or even just family values: there is an energy and commitment there we can harness. </p> <p>Where 15 years ago many thought that there would always be a trade-off between progress and the environment, we can now see a way through. What becomes clear is that to preserve what we value most - our local environment, the countryside around us - we must protect the whole earth, and do so by pioneering new ways of building, working, living. New technologies to deliver a low carbon economy; to use our finite resources more efficiently, to reform national and international institutions and create positive incentives to be green. </p> <p>In short, we don't halt progress and retreat into the past, nor do we carry on regardless. Instead we take pride in our progress. Using our creativity in partnership to protect the environment. </p> <p><b>The threat</b> </p> <p>We have made a lot of progress over this Parliament. Through John Prescott's leadership, and the hard work of Michael here on the platform with me, we can point to measurable achievements. We are on track to meet our Kyoto targets. Air quality is improving. London now has the cleanest river of any major city. </p> <p>But we have to face a stark fact. Neither we here in Britain, nor our partners abroad, have succeeded in reversing the overall destructive trend. The environmental challenge continues to grow and become more urgent: </p> <p>\u0095 There are alarming changes in our atmosphere, in global temperatures, in weather patterns, in sea levels and in the protective ozone layer. As a result, across the world millions face drought, flooding, disease. Here in the UK we too face threats - the prospect of exotic diseases becoming commonplace, of increased levels of skin cancer, of floods in some years, droughts in others, of low lying areas being swallowed by the sea. </p> <p>\u0095 Global population growth will put increased pressure on natural resources. The world pop is set to rise from 6bn to 9bn by 2050. So that economies across the world have the opportunity to develop, we must all use resources far more efficiently and switch to clean technologies. </p> <p>\u0095 Fresh water is being polluted or simply used up. Demand is doubling every 21 years while supply is broadly unchanged. </p> <p>\u0095 Soil degradation has affected two-thirds of the world's agricultural lands over the last 50 years, and the situation is getting worse. </p> <p>\u0095 Half the world's wetlands have been lost over the past century and with them their unique plants and animals; and this is accelerating </p> <p>\u0095 One in ten of the world's tree species are at risk of extinction, and increasingly whole forest systems are under threat </p> <p>\u0095 Fishing fleets are still 40 per cent larger than the oceans can sustain and yet it still benefits from subsidies, world wide </p> <p>\u0095 Here in the UK farmland birds are disappearing, the house sparrow, once more cockney than the Cockneys, is now a rarity in London, and congestion means that urban traffic moves at the same speed as in 1890. </p> <p>Of two things I am certain. We are not going to turn this round unless we re-engage the political system on the importance of the environmental challenge. We are not going to be able to engage consumers and business unless we offer them a positive agenda. </p> <p><b>A new approach to the environment</b> </p> <p>We need to build a new coalition for the environment, a coalition that works with the grain of consumers, business and science, not against them. A coalition that harnesses consumer demand for a better environment, and encourages businesses to see the profit of the new green technologies. and a coalition that stretches across national frontiers. </p> <p>The central theme of our approach is a more productive use of environmental resources. It is clear that if we are to continue to grow, and share the benefits of that growth; we must reduce the impact of growth on the environment. Some commentators estimate that we'll need a tenfold increase in the efficiency with which we use resources by 2050 only to stand still. Above all, we need to be clear about our priorities, and the principles that underlie our approach: </p> <p>\u0095 First, the greatest threat to our environment today is climate change. The Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution has said that the UK will have to cut the CO2 we produce by 60% by 2050 if we are to slow down the pace of change. If there is one immediate issue that threatens global disaster, it is the changes in our atmosphere. </p> <p>\u0095 Second, problems need to be addressed at the right level. A problem like climate change requires international as well as national action. The reason for taking the lead in cutting national emissions, as we have in the UK, is to give us the standing and authority in international negotiations. And developed countries, as the principle producers of greenhouse gases, should set an example for developing ones. </p> <p>\u0095 Third, we should harness consumer demand, not stifle it. We should not be trying to reduce people's aspirations, but rather find innovative ways of satisfying those aspirations. As our societies become more prosperous, so people's demand for a better environment is growing. More and more people want to buy green. We should encourage that, and harness that green consumer power in our environmental policies </p> <p>\u0095 Fourth, we must stimulate science and innovation. I reject the pessimistic notion that most environmental problems can only be managed, not solved. Technological advance does offer opportunities, particularly to counter climate change and provide alternatives to finite energy resources. </p> <p>\u0095 Fifth, we need to use environmental resources more efficiently and to become a low-carbon, recycling economy. We need to become much more effective about how we use finite resources. Stephen Byers set out a radical new direction in his speech to Greenpeace's Business Conference earlier this month, focussing on resource productivity and the Government's programme to boost renewable energy. </p> <p>\u0095 Lastly, we should see protecting the environment as a business opportunity. There is a growing market for environmental goods and services - currently worth an amazing US$335 billion - as large as the world market for pharmaceuticals or aerospace. I am not saying that the interests of business and the environment have become identical. But we should exploit them and develop them when they are. Otherwise, history shows us the environment risks being the loser. </p> <p><b>New Labour's Green Agenda</b> </p> <p>I make no apology for the priority we have given education, health and crime. Yet no other British Government has had a Deputy Prime Minister in charge of environment policy. And no other British Government has put the environment at the heart of its policy-making across the board - from foreign affairs to the national curriculum - in the way this Government has. Since 1997, we have: </p> <p>\u0095 Taken a lead internationally, as at Kyoto. \u0095 Introduced an air quality strategy going beyond even the tough new European standards \u0095 Cleaned up decades of pollution of our beaches and rivers, and given greater protection to important wildlife sites \u0095 Factored environmental considerations into all our legislation and policy, from the Utilities Act to innovative fiscal measures such as incentives and hypothecation \u0095 And as a result of the Comprehensive Spending Review, started to invest billions in transport to increase choice and cut congestion and pollution </p> <p>Yet I would be the first to say that there is still a lot more we could and will do. </p> <p>John Prescott will shortly publish the final version of our strategy on Climate Change. It will set out how Britain plans to deliver its international obligations to cut greenhouse gases by 12.5% and move towards a 20% reduction in CO2 emissions. This will include a 10% target for energy from renewables by 2010. </p> <p>As part of the Climate Change Levy package, businesses will be able to claim capital allowances for investments they make in energy-saving technologies from next April. I can also announce that we will shortly be launching a new Carbon Trust in Britain that will channel up to \u00a350 million a year developing low-carbon technology, partly funded from the Climate Change Levy. We have worked closely with business and the research community since their participation is vital to the Trust's long-term success. The Trust will take the lead on low-carbon technology and innovation in this country, and put Britain in the lead internationally. </p> <p>We will also be setting up an office to export Britain's low-carbon technologies, the Kyoto Mechanisms Office. This was suggested to me at a meeting I had on climate change with business leaders earlier this year. By encouraging the private sector to invest in innovative energy projects abroad, it will help tackle climate change and allow British business to seize new opportunities. The Office will start work in April 2001. </p> <p>Next Spring, we will be launching the first national CO2 emissions trading system anywhere in the world. Emissions trading is one of the most powerful ways of harnessing the market to cut greenhouse gases. The trading system will set overall limits on emissions for CO2 producers entering the system, and allow them to trade \"emission allowances\" amongst themselves, to the profit of the cleanest factories and companies. </p> <p>If we are to reduce our dependence on oil and high-carbon energy, we will need to develop commercially viable renewable energy. I believe government has a key role to play in assisting business build up the economies of scale in these new technologies so that they can compete effectively. Today, we are announcing proposals for \u00a350 million from the New Opportunities Fund to support offshore wind and biomass. The DTI is already providing \u00a339 million for new offshore wind turbines, and the first are about to go into operation off Blyth. Helen Liddle has set up a task force to examine ways of promoting solar energy. And I have also asked the Performance and Innovation Unit to undertake a comprehensive study into the future of renewable energy, with a view to increasing substantially our long-term investment. </p> <p>Any environmental policy has to address the implications of the car. Transport produces around 25% of global CO2 and rising. Making public transport more attractive will take us only so far. The long-term solution is to make vehicles cleaner and more fuel efficient. That is why we have used the tax system to roll out cleaner fuels. Lead in petrol is now a thing of the past, and we are now using tax incentives to promote ultra-low sulphur petrol. Through the EU, we have persuaded manufacturers to improve fuel efficiency by 25%. Vehicle Excise Duty is now linked to vehicle emissions for the first time. Toyota and Honda are now selling \"hybrid\" cars which are twice as efficient as conventional models. Honda's Insight does 80 mpg. Fuel cell powered electric cars will offer even more - truly pollution-free motoring. Both Mercedes and Ford plan to have them in the showrooms by 2004. </p> <p>We will also be doing more to protect Britain's urban and rural environment. Our Countryside and Rights of Way Bill will protect wildlife and sites of special scientific interest. In our forthcoming Rural White Paper we will set out policies for a living countryside which is economically vibrant, conserves wildlife and landscapes and which everyone can enjoy. And the Urban White Paper will set out our National Strategy for Neighbourhood renewal. We are also proposing that the New Opportunities Funds should invest another \u00a350 million for quality of life in urban and rural settlements and for green spaces. </p> <p>On recycling, we want to do more to harness the power of the market. The new Waste Resource Action Programme, led by business, will develop markets for recycled materials. A proposed further 50 million pounds from The New Opportunities Fund will help provide kerbside recycling for 700,000 households. I want to see every local authority offering doorstep recycling to take advantage of these new markets. And the office co-ordinating government procurement will soon begin trialling the purchasing of recycled products, using government purchasing to expand the market. </p> <p>On regulation, our aim must be to raise environmental standards without imposing unnecessary burdens on business. Often, the most effective approach to raising standards is a cross-border one. That is why we are working with the European Commission and other member states to improve the regulatory process in Europe. </p> <p>This brings me to environmental diplomacy. The international climate change negotiations remain a key government priority, and we will be taking a leading role in The Hague next month. I also want to extend the EU's economic reform agenda to new energy saving technologies. And I can announce today that I plan to attend the next Earth Summit in 2002, and I will be encouraging other world leaders to join us there. </p> <p><b>Business, technology and the environment</b> </p> <p>Fifteen years ago, if you said business will help save the environment people would have laughed at you. Today, I believe that is a serious proposition. </p> <p>As BP's John Browne has said, the enlightened company increasingly recognises that there are good commercial reasons for being ahead of the pack when it comes to issues to do with the environment. </p> <p>Environmentally-aware oil companies are finding ways to recapture the CO2 produced by plant and equipment and pump it back underground to enhance the recovery of oil. They are working with car manufacturers on new technologies, from developing fuel cell cars, to putting hydrogen-powered buses on the road in Europe. </p> <p>Shell is playing a major role in the move away from oil in power generation. Like its competitor BP, it is investing heavily in solar power. ABB recently shifted its focus from being a builder of traditional large-scale power plants to focus on small scale renewable technologies. It expects alternative energy solutions to account for US$1 billion worth of business for the company within the next five years. </p> <p>It is increasingly clear that energy generation in the future will become a spectrum: from the cleaner extraction of energy from fossil fuels; through the move from liquid to cleaner gas fuels; new technologies that convert hydrocarbon fuels into energy without combustion; to, at its greenest end, the carbon free technologies of wind and solar. </p> <p>The City and investment community is beginning to recognise the new commercial and environmental realities, and to make money out of them. The return on equity of the new Dow Jones Sustainability Group Index averaged 15%, compared to 8% for the regular index for the first half of this year. And more individual investors are choosing ethical investment portfolios which reflect their values. Legislation earlier this year on Statements of Investment Principles required pension funds for the first time to disclose whether they take ethical, environmental or social factors into account in their decisions. </p> <p>The World Business Council on Sustainable Development, of which many of you here today are members, is driving forward the agenda to increase the efficient use of resources. I would also like to see more reporting on environmental and social performance. The pioneers of environmental reporting - companies like BA, BT, British Gas, and BP - are seeing increasing benefits from both improved efficiencies and public image as a result. This is something that all companies should be doing, and I am issuing a challenge, today, to all of the top 350 companies to be publishing annual environment reports by the end of 2001. </p> <p><b>The role of civil society</b> </p> <p>Increasingly, NGOs are also putting more and more energy into offering solutions in partnership with business and government. </p> <p>For example, the Worldwide Fund for Nature and Unilever have set up the Marine Stewardship Council to protect our endangered fish stocks. Thames Water and the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust have converted redundant reservoirs and treatment at Barn Elms into a fantastic new wildlife habitat. Fourteen companies, eight NGOs and three Government departments are working together on the Digital Futures project, to try to ensure that the e-commerce revolution happens in the most environmentally friendly way possible. And eight years ago Greenpeace began research on Greenfreeze refrigeration technology to reduce the destruction of the Ozone layer. It is now a highly successful example of green organisation and industry working together for the benefit of the Ozone layer. Coca Cola and Unilever have just announce they will move towards such alternative refrigerants such as Greenfreeze by 2005. </p> <p>Government, business, the NGOs and the public need to move forward together. That is why we have set up the new Sustainable Development Commission. I have asked Jonathan Porritt to chair it and I am very pleased to launch it today. The members, drawn from business, local government, pressure groups and academia, will build a consensus, monitor our progress, and suggest ways we can reconcile the needs of the environment, the economy and society. </p> <p><b>Conclusion</b> </p> <p>So the outlook is not all bleak. There is real progress. But it is a race against time, lethargy, and indifference. It is an urgent issue. People feel it; but they don't always know how to make a difference. </p> <p>Millions of people around the country are \"green\" in their actions, their beliefs, what they care about. They want the air they breath to be fresh. They want the countryside they live in or visit to be protected. They have respect for the world around them - hate cruelty to animals, hate the destruction of natural beauty. They want their neighbourhoods to have parks and be free from litter, grafitti, kids with nothing to do, and crime. Millions recycle, more would like to. Millions of children care passionately about the environment. That is their politics. But they need to know the \"how\" as well as the \"why\". </p> <p>The root of my political beliefs is the idea of community: of solidarity. Today such an idea can only live on, based on mutual rights and responsibilities. The essence of environmental politics is the notion of responsibility to nature and future generations to protect and enhance the environment. Its why we wrote it into the new Clause IV of our Party Constitution. </p> <p>We have to show how this strongly held belief can translate into practical action. To do that, we need a partnership between government, business and the environmental movement, to extend the frontiers of progress, to show the way through. We need more understanding, more dialogue, a healthy recognition of areas of disagreement, and then a common campaign of explanation, to put across the urgency of the problems and the viability of the solutions. </p> <p>We have one common aim: to show how by doing good to the environment, we enrich our lives, in quality and prosperity. Concern for the environment is not a yoke on our necks. It is the lifting of the yoke. The burden is lighter. The way is clearer. I believe it can be done. </p> <p>Let's sell the new insight - we can be richer by being greener; and by being greener we will enrich the quality of our lives. </p>",
  "Tony Blair announced a \u00a3100m boost for green policies today as he called for a \"new coalition\" to protect the environment. <p>In a speech to the CBI and Green Alliance in London, the prime minister said that environmental groups and business people had to work together with consumers and sciencists to see the profit of green technologies.</p> <p>The address was Mr Blair's first on environmental issues for three years. In it he argued that prosperity and the environment were not enemies.</p> <p>\"We get richer by being greener and by being greener we will enrich the quality of our lives,\" he said. \"The central theme of our approach is a more productive use of environmental resources. It is clear that if we are to continue to grow, and share the benefits of that growth, we must reduce the impact of growth on the environment.\"</p> <p>The \u00a3100m promised by the prime minister will be used to help carbon emissions and improve the take up of renewable energy. A \u00a350m \"carbon trust\" will encourage low carbon technologies, reducing harmful \"greenhouse gas\" emissions, and \u00a350m from the government's new opportunities fund will encourage research in renewable energy such as solar or wind power. </p> <p>But Mr Blair conceded there were \"hard choices\" to be made between \"ideals and realism\" in key areas such as petrol consumption and the need to build new houses in the south east. </p> <p>\"There are at points real conflict between the immediate interests of consumption and the longer term interests of the environment - and to be frank, between the politicans' need to woo the electorate as well as lead them.\" The Conservative leader, William Hague, attacked the government's environmental policy as \"all talk, no action\". </p>",
  "<p>A teenage entrepreneur has made \u00a3300,000 by selling a website he set up in his bedroom 18 months ago to a company planning to build a global multi-media firm focused on the Jewish community. </p> <p>Benjamin Cohen, 18, from Elstree in north London, has sold his sojewish.net website to AIM-listed Totally in return for shares.

  "There is a way for Tony Blair to defuse the threat of further fuel protests and trump the Tories' proposal to reduce fuel duty by 3p a litre: cut Vehicle Excise Duty for small- and medium-size cars. Low-income rural motorists would be the biggest winners but some two thirds of all drivers would benefit. <p>A road tax rebate targeted only at rural residents - which has been suggested - is too problematic. It would result in a postcode lottery where one person gets the discount but people on a neighbouring street do not and tax evasion where city dwellers register their cars with country relatives or at their second homes. The main objection, though, is that it does not help the majority of middle Britain. </p> <p>Tax on petrol and diesel is part of the government's long-term strategy to cut carbon dioxide emissions to help prevent global warming. Increases in fuel duty between 1996 and 1999 are estimated to save between one and 2.5m tonnes of carbon emissions by 2010, a significant contribution to the UK's climate change strategy. A recent report by Stephen Glaister and Dan Graham for the Automobile Association concluded that a 10% increase in fuel prices would lead to a reduction in fuel consumption of about 7%, mainly through improved fuel economy. </p> <p>There is a fundamental inconsistency between the government claiming to lead the international community in combating climate change and their calling on Opec to increase oil production. The Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, based on the overwhelming consensus of scientific opinion, argues that the UK needs to cut carbon dioxide emissions by at least 60% by the middle of this century to avert the worst effects of global warming. We need to kick the fossil fuel habit, not to exacerbate it. </p> <p>Road tax as currently structured contributes virtually nothing to the climate change strategy. It is Treasury policy to rebalance taxes on motoring from tax on ownership, such as road tax, to tax on car use, such as road tolls. The government has made a start with a new lower \u00a3100 rate for cars with engines up to 1,100cc, extended to cars up to 1,200cc from next March. From next year there will be a graduated system for new cars, with four bands based on carbon dioxide emissions. Those with higher emissions will pay more. But for the vast majority of existing cars there is a flat rate of \u00a3155 independent of engine size or fuel economy. </p> <p>It would be entirely consistent to introduce a more graduated system of road tax for existing cars. For example a \u00a350 cut for all cars up to 1,800cc would create three bands, a \u00a350 rate for cars up to 1,200cc, \u00a3105 for cars up to 1,800cc and \u00a3155 for those more than 1,800cc. This would include more than two thirds of the cars on the road and nine out of the 10 most popular models on sale this year, while encouraging the purchase of smaller, more fuel-efficient cars and discouraging the gas-guzzlers. </p> <p>For most motorists this would be worth more than a 3p cut in fuel duty, which would save a typical motorist about \u00a335 a year. For example, the saving on fuel costs for a 1.8 litre Ford Fo cus doing 10,000 miles at 38 miles per gallon would be about \u00a336.50. </p> <p>In particular, low-income rural motorists who need their cars but drive fewer miles than average would have more to gain from a \u00a350 cut in road tax. Average annual car mileage for low-income rural motorists, those in the bottom 40% of the income distribution, is about 8,000 miles. As the chart shows, a typical low-income rural motorist would save less than \u00a330 from a 3p cut in fuel duty. Relative to a 3p cut in fuel duty, the winners from a \u00a350 cut in road tax would be the owners of small- and medium-sized cars who drive less than about 15,000 miles a year (depending on fuel efficiency). The losers would be those who drive gas-guzzlers or do more than about 15,000 miles a year (about 16% of cars). </p> <p>None of this addresses the problems of hauliers, which stem more from over-capacity in the industry than from taxation. Official statistics show that more than 99.9% of deliveries within Britain are by UK-registered hauliers, so there is little evidence of competition from overseas. Current levels of taxation are justified to cover the costs of road haulage in pollution, congestion, accidents and damage to the roads. But there is a case for recognising the short-term pain of the haulage industry and levelling the playing field with foreign lorries on international journeys. </p> <p>A cut in road tax for lorries, which ranges from \u00a3280 a year to about \u00a33,500 for different sizes, could be appropriate if at the same time the government signalled the introduction of the \"Eurovignette\" or \"Brit-disc\" at a later date. This is similar to road tax but can also be charged on lorries registered abroad when they visit the UK. An average cut in road tax of \u00a3500 for lorries and a \u00a350 cut for cars up to 1,800 cc would cost about \u00a31bn a year compared with the \u00a31.26bn cost of a 3p cut in fuel duty in the next financial year. </p> <p>There would be room for a further package of measures to promote public transport, rural services and alternative fuels. IPPR's proposals include extra money for buses, tax-free travel vouchers to encourage green commuting and grants to convert cars and lorries to cleaner fuels. </p> <p> Tony Grayling is a senior research fellow at the Institute for Public Policy Research </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:t.grayling@ippr.org.uk\">t.grayling@ippr.org.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>It is a strange appointment for a newspaper to make. Six months after we announced in these pages that the Guardian was to take part in the Year of the Artist scheme - dedicated to placing 1,000 artists in 1,000 workplaces - we can announce the name of the selected artist. </p> <p>Michael Atavar is a digital artist, working with text, sound and images, all channelled through the world wide web. But, unlike most people working in a newspaper office, Atavar dedicates himself to slowing down the communication of information. \"My work is almost the antithesis of the newspaper environment,\" he says. \"It's a radically different perspective.

  "<p>Senior US diplomats have praised the efforts of Tony Blair's government to capture the drive and productivity of Britain's emerging technology and internet sectors and help them turn the domestic economy into Europe's top performer, according to documents obtained by the Guardian. </p> <p>In private dispatches to Washington this year, officials at the US Embassy in London have reported that US firms \"have taken notice of how the one-time 'sick man of Europe' is now the economic leader\" on the continent\". </p> <p>They added that Britain's hi-tech entrepreneurs have cast off the old \"British reserve\" and are now imbued with a new \"can-do\" spirit. </p> <p>A campaign to increase trade between US and British firms should \"go a long way to fulfilling the needs of our new generation of exporters,\" the Americans wrote. </p> <p>The officials wrote in June: \"As New Labour enters its fourth year in power, the government is taking action to build on the macro-economic success it enjoys in having created the strongest UK economy in more than two decades. </p> <p>\"By introducing new policies and legislation to foster entrepreneurs and the emerging technologies needed to transform the economy, the government intends to increase productivity, and hence UK global competitiveness, far into the 21st century.\" </p> <p>In March, the officials had told colleagues in Washington: \"The prime minister and the New Labour government have set out to make the UK the economic engine of the EU, with e-commerce and emerging technologies the means to achieve this goal.\" </p> <p>The reports underline how the embassy has been working closely with the \"highest levels\" of the Blair government to encourage American firms to invest in Britain. Ambassador Philip Lader has met chancellor Gordon Brown and trade and industry secretary Stephen Byers several times. </p> <p>In the spring, a team of embassy officials were tasked to investigate \"Britain's second industrial revolution, the change to an information-based economy\". </p> <p>The diplomats reported: \"The team criss-crossed 'Silicon Fen', the area surrounding Cambridge, to meet the inventors, entrepreneurs, academics, venture capitalists and officials that have turned this area into Europe's leading area of innovation.\" </p> <p>They added that a \"rapidly increasing number\" of American IT and internet companies were seeking business partners in this \"hotbed of cutting-edge technology companies\". </p> <p>The embassy reports were disclosed to the Guardian under the US freedom of information act. </p> <p>They show that the Americans were pleased with a conference which they organised in March this year on new technologies. </p> <p>\"One event, a panel discussion by local 'start-up' business leaders most of whom are now billionaires, epitomised the switch from the old 'British reserve' to the new 'can-do' approach of UK industry - with US technology and partners.\" </p> <p>Despite the diplomatic backslapping, many industry executives are concerned with the latest corporate developments in Britain. Smaller start-ups say provisions for share options in their profit and loss accounts - recommended by the Accounting Standards Board - could cost the industry billions. </p> <p>The government's controversial regulation of investigatory powers (Rip) bill, which relates to computer communications, was deemed so draconian that companies such as Nokia and Yahoo! warned they might move from British shores. </p> <p>The chief executive of one UK internet success story said: \"What the government has got to stop doing is treating the internet as a photo opportunity and more as a serious commercial prospect.\" </p> <p><strong>Live wire ideas</strong></p> <p>Tony Blair pledged to put electronic business at the heart of the British economy.

  "Tony Blair has never met George W Bush. The newest episode in the Anglo-American relationship, which may begin in a fortnight's time, will get off to a jarring start. Governor Bush was due to tour Europe and Asia last spring, to make himself known to foreign leaders and enrich his image back home. That's what presidential candidates do. But the visits were called off, because Bush's campaign handlers thought they wouldn't help. They feared he would make a fool of himself. Since then, the evidence has accumulated that they were right. <p>For Mr Blair, and therefore for Britain, a Bush presidency offers alarming possibilities. It is true that, when he woke up to the fact that he was president, Mr Bush would probably survey the world and recognise Anglo-London as a first foreign haven. Though knowledgeable about Latin-America, he is ignorant of Europeans, and would be inclined to fall back on the British bonds familiar to George Bush I. </p> <p>But the culture-shock to Mr Blair will be great. He has grown close to Bill Clinton. They talk more often and more equally than any prime minister and president for 50 years, Thatcher-Reagan included. Their brains as well as ideology are a match. The third way, so-called, is a common project, their version of a globalised idea. As well as enjoying exchanges of wonkishness about healthcare or education reform, the two helped each other out of tight corners, and if Al Gore wins, the continuities will be pretty seamless. </p> <p>Mr Bush comes from somewhere else. Though wallowing in a sea of unspecifics, he knows what he doesn't like, and most of it is represented by Clinton-Gore and, by extension, Blair. His biggest pitch is anti-Washington, which means anti-government. He has entered into little policy talk with the American people, so it's a fair bet there would be none with his friends across the ocean. Bush is aggressively uninterested in that way of being a political leader, let alone in the kind of social democratic world that has given several European leaders more useful relationships with Washington than have existed for decades. </p> <p>But that's only the beginning. It is now clear that Bush and his people regard 21st century Europe very differently from the view that prevailed in Washington in the second half of the 20th. They positively desire a greater distancing, especially of the American army. When Bush began to hint at this a few months ago, most of the foreign policy establishment here put it down to campaign talk. The protection of our boys from crazy foreign adventures made useful headlines. Actually we now know Bush has every intention of withdrawing American troops from the Balkans, as part of a philosophy which is working towards an end to interventionism anywhere on any grounds other than US strategic interest. </p> <p>His chief foreign policy adviser, Condoleezza Rice, told the New York Times that \"peace-keeping\" missions would be out, because they were a distraction from America's prime duties in the Gulf and the Taiwan straits. In Europe, there had to be a \"new division of labour\": a statement made, by the way, in apparent ignorance of the fact that Europeans currently supply more than 80% of the peacekeeping force in Bosnia and Kosovo. When Bush's spokesman was challenged with the implications of the new doctrine, he said that the governor was \"100%\" behind what Ms Rice had said. </p> <p>So an unbrave new world beckons, which is likely to destabilise Nato as well as re-positioning Washington's global relationships. American economic dominance will grow and grow, but American responsibilities as the only super-power are set for the kind of drastic re-think that the European left once dreamed of, but which is now more likely to upset our modernised social democratic governments. </p> <p>If the Bush doctrine takes hold for four years, it will pre-empt most of the British argument against Blair's efforts to build Europe's own security. Tory objections to the embryonic Euro-defence force will be emptier than ever - the St Malo agreement that got it under way will look like a singular piece of Anglo-French prescience. But, shorn of major bits of US capability, Nato could look radically different. Forget about more enlargement. Forget about much more peacekeeping. Meanwhile, a unilateral American national missile defence (NMD), pushed through without regard for what allies have to say, grows naturally out of the coming mind-set. One Washington expert, who monitors security issues with an intimate insider's eye, told me he regarded NMD as now certain to be deployed if Bush wins. </p> <p>He will surround himself, of course, with advisers. General Colin Powell is regarded as the prime candidate for secretary of state, and might even be announced as such before November 7, to reel in those voters who look at Governor Bush and see only a dim-witted Reagan without the excuse of being an actor, or the defence of having a simple vision he will cling to. Reagan did have the big idea that he needed to beat the Soviets, a task in which he succeeded. Because of that governing notion, the times accommodated, and even profited from, a leader otherwise unqualified for world leadership, whose purpose everyone could easily figure out. </p> <p>Modern times are different. There is neither big idea nor big challenge: no missile gap, no space race, no evil empire. Foreign policy is the task of building alliances, largely by personal persuasion. A president can't subcontract the task of choosing between advisers whose opinions, however clever, conflict. He has to decide himself, about matters of great complexity. Nor can he cajole allies or persuade Congress except by his own negotiating talents. The hands-off president is not, these days, an option. But the hands-on president needs a set of skills, including an interest in policy detail and a sophisticated alertness to the world, of which George Dubya Bush has shown staggeringly little command. </p> <p>In foreign policy, Congress will be no counter-force to a new era of US-first unilateralism. Internationally, a do-nothing president will meet only the grateful acquiescence of the legislature. On the Hill, the age of internationalism is dead, something Clinton at first did not work hard to repudiate. But in the end he did so. Gore blows the same muted trumpet, and Blair, the liberal interventionist, chimes with him. The new President Bush would be the man who said earlier this year that \"we should not send our troops to stop ethnic cleansing and genocide in nations outside our strategic interest\". His adviser's words about Nato seem just as reckless, but just as revealing. They are not a posture, but a position. They're probably the decided view of a majority of Americans, whose ignorance, however, has until now always had an enemy in the White House. </p>",
  "Pressure on the airline industry, already under fire following the death of a 28-year-old woman from a blood clot after a long haul flight from Australia, is likely to increase with the publication of a House of Lords report calling for better health and safety conditions for air travellers. <p>The science and technology select committee, which is due to report on the medical environment of aircraft cabins in three weeks, is expected to criticise the way air quality has deteriorated dramatically, as well as recommending that airlines give passengers more explicit preventive advice about deep vein thrombosis (DVT) before long-haul flights. </p> <p>The condition, often referred to as \"economy class syndrome\" because it can be brought on by sitting for long periods in cramped conditions, caused the death of Emma Christofferson, a sales assistant with Marks and Spencer, who developed a blood clot after sitting in an economy seat for the 20-hour return journey from a holiday in Australia. </p> <p>Her death has prompted an outcry from travel safety experts, who claim that not enough has been done to alert passengers to the risks and what precautions they should take. </p> <p>According to Farrol Khan, director of the Aviation Health Institute, which researches air deaths, the amount of leg room makes many economy class airline cabins a health hazard. \"Airlines should be like other industries and label their products correctly and be upfront about how their product can cause blood clots on long-haul flights,\" he said yesterday. </p> <p>\"The danger in economy class is far greater because when the passenger is sitting still the usual pumping action of the calf and thigh muscles no longer pushes the blood up to the heart while at the same time the pressure on the edge of the seat blocks the return of the venous blood,\" he said. </p> <p>Although no detailed research has been carried out, Mr Khan estimates that as many as 6,000 passengers a year may die as a result of DVT, with as little as three hours of cramped conditions putting some people at potential risk of blood clots in the deep veins of the legs which can move to the lungs, causing a potentially fatal embolism. </p> <p>The Lords select committee is expected to call on airlines to advise passengers to drink plenty of water, take aspirin - which helps to thin the blood - and exercise leg muscles during the flight to try to fend off the condition. </p> <p>The inquiry, which was in part prompted by an illness contracted by the Labour peer Lord Graham on a long-haul flight, has heard expert medical evidence suggesting new research needs to be undertaken to gain a full picture of the scale of risk. Yesterday a spokesman for British Airways, which reduced the gap between its seats from 32 to 31 inches after privatisation, said what evidence there was into the causes of DVT showed it could affect passengers in first and business class just as readily as those in economy. \"It really is a misnomer to call it economy class syndrome,\" the spokesman said. \"There are examples of people experiencing DVT just from sitting still for long periods. </p> <p>\"Like any health issue, we take it seriously, but we already have clear guidelines in place, both in our in-flight magazine and on the British Airways website, warning people of the dangers and advising them on what to do.\" </p> <p>Medical experts say that middle-aged or elderly passengers, pregnant women, smokers and those with cardiovascular disease are usually most at risk, but for disaster to strike other factors usually have to come into play such as dehydration, a fatty meal or oral contraception. </p> <p>Simon Evans, a spokesman for the Air Transport Users Council, said the airlines could do more to alert passengers to the dangers. \"Many airlines do give advice to passengers not to sit in the same position for too long and to move around, but it is perhaps an area where they could make the advice more prominent, perhaps in the form of a loudspeaker announcement.\" </p> <p>The Lords will also make recommendations on air recycling, which is seen by travel experts as another potential health problem for airline passengers. </p> <p>Since the 1970s, airlines have saved on fuel costs by mixing fresh air with 50% recycled air that has been passed through high efficiency particulate air filters that are supposed to remove dangerous pathogens, but if they become clogged or dirty their effectiveness can be reduced, leaving passengers exposed to bacteria. </p> <p>There have been a number of cases of people contracting tuberculosis after long-haul flights, almost certainly as a result of breathing partly recirculated air. </p> <p>The committee is expected to propose that air is not recirculated, a move that would increase airlines' fuel bill by as much as 2%. The Lords committee will argue that air filters should be regularly checked, instead of being systematically altered on the basis of their age. They may also propose that airlines are required to offer air ventilation adjusters above seats. </p> <p>The committee is also understood to have been struck by the lack of an international body to oversee passenger safety or set minimum standards. Members of the select committee, including Lord Winston, believe air travel is more dangerous than other forms of transport such as long car journeys or rail trips. </p> <p>Lord Winston told the committee: \"You can stop the motor car and you can get out at a garage and walk around, and you cannot in an aircraft. Similarly in a train, you are not in the precisely confined seating that you really are in many modern aircraft. </p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.aviation-health.org\" target=\"_NEW\">www.aviation-health.org</a></p>",

  "While the US presidential debates were in full swing, I was pondering what I would ask the candidates if I had the opportunity to pose just one question. So here it is, Vice President Gore and Governor Bush: are you at all concerned about the mounting consumer debt spreading across every demographic sector of the United States population? <p>Gore and Bush seem to agree that the economy is humming, and have chosen to debate merely how best to allocate all of the surplus revenues. In the meantime, they both ignore a darker reality, one that could quickly change all of the up-beat economic forecasts coming out of Wall Street and Washington. </p> <p>Although economists and politicians don't want to talk about it, the fact is that the \"American miracle\" has, to a great extent, been bought on credit. It is impossible to understand the dramatic growth of the American economy and reduction in US unemployment in recent years without examining the close relationship that has developed between economic expansion, job creation and the amassing of record consumer debt. Consumer credit has been growing for nearly a decade. Credit card companies are extending credit at unprecedented levels. Millions of American consumers are buying \"on credit\", and because they are, millions of other Americans have gone back to work to make the goods and perform the services being purchased. As a result, the economy seems healthier than ever. </p> <p>Today, according to the Federal Reserve, Americans are spending more than they are taking in, marking the first time since the Great Depression that the country has experienced a negative savings rate. Just eight years ago the average savings rate in the US was 8% of after-tax income. Savings are now at their lowest level - 0.2 % - since monthly records began in 1959. </p> <p>Britain is fast following the American lead. In just the past year, the UK household savings rate plunged from 6.7% to 3%. If it continues to decline at this pace, the savings rate will likely be negative by this time next year, with potentially ominous consequences for the economy and society. </p> <p>An analogous situation occurred in the 1920s. Like today, that was a period of great economic change. Electricity replaced steam power across every major industry, greatly increasing the productive capacity of the country. Productivity gains, however, were not matched by a significant increase in worker compensation. Wages remained relatively flat, while many marginal workers lost their jobs in the wake of cheaper, more efficient technology substitutions. By the late 1920s, American industry was running at only 75% of capacity in most key sectors. The fruits of the new productivity gains were not being distributed broadly enough among workers to sustain increased consumption. Concerned over ineffective consumer demand, banks and retailers extended cheap credit in the form of instalment buying to encourage workers to spend more and keep the economy growing. By late 1929, consumer debt was so high it could no longer be sustained. Even the bull market was being stoked by record purchases of stocks on brokers' credit. Finally, the entire house of cards collapsed. </p> <p>The short-term substitution of consumer credit in lieu of a broad redistribution of new productivity gains is a subject that has received little, if any, attention among economists. Still, the fact remains that great technology revolutions generally spread quickly, once all of the critical elements are in place. The problem is that it generally takes at least a generation or more after a defining new technology finally comes on line, for social movements to build enough coherence and momentum to demand a fair share of the vast productivity gains that have been made possible. In the 1920s, the crisis of increased productive capacity and ineffective consumer purchasing power was met by the extension of consumer credit to unprecedented levels. </p> <p>The same phenomenon is occurring today. The productivity gains brought on by the information and telecommunication revolutions are finally being felt and, in the process, virtually every major industry is facing global underutilisation of capacity and insufficient consumer demand. Once again, in the US, consumer credit has become the palliative, a way to keep the economic engines throttled up, at least for a time. </p> <p>Consumer credit is growing by a staggering 9% annual rate and personal bankruptcies are increasing. In 1994, 780,000 Americans filed for bankruptcy. By 1999, the number of bankruptcies had soared to 1,281,000. </p> <p>If countries of the European Union were to lower their current family savings rate to zero, as the US has, they could probably accelerate economic growth and reduce unemployment to under 4%. Millions of people spending money \"on credit\" would assuredly grow the economy and bring millions of European workers back to work to make the goods and perform the services being purchased on credit. But following the US lead would only result in a short-term fix and create the conditions for an even more profound long-term period of economic instability when the extension of credit reached its limits, pushing consumers into default and the economy into a downward spiral, as occurred in the late 1920s and early 1930s. </p> <p>The issue at hand is: how long can Americans continue to spend more than they make, moving deeper and deeper into commercial debt? In the current situation, any number of external events could tip the scale, with potentially calamitous consequences. If the energy crisis were to deepen, raising fuel and energy costs, or the stock market were to experience a sudden and sustained down-turn, or major lending institutions were to pull back on their loans, the effect on all of our lives could be sobering indeed. </p> <p>The new economy won't be a reality until we have found a way to distribute the productivity gains of the e-commerce revolution broadly, to ensure enough consumer purchasing power to match the increases in productive capacity. In the past, that has always meant increases in wages and benefits and a reduction in work hours. If, instead, wages and benefits for middle and working-class Americans are allowed to remain relatively stagnant, as they have been for nearly a decade, and instead artificially prop up purchasing power by pushing millions of Ameri cans into record debt, we may squander the historic opportunity we now have to create a truly new economy that works for everyone. </p> <p>It is unlikely that either of the presidential candidates will focus on the troubling spectre of negative savings. Yet, whoever takes over the White House, it's a sure bet that sooner or later, the issue of ever-expanding consumer debt will force all of us to take notice. We may look back on the current \"prosperity\" with the same cynical regard as earlier generations who lived through the short-lived boom years of the Roaring 20s. </p> <p>Jeremy Rifkin is the author of The Age of Access: How the Shift From Ownership to Access is Transforming Capitalism </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",

  "<p>WPP, the world's biggest advertising group, yesterday announced bumper figures on the back of millennium celebrations, the Olympics and new business from global companies such as Ford and Nike. </p> <p>The company, which has just finalised the takeover of New York-based agency Young &amp; Rubicam, said it had signed a batch of lucrative contracts and was yet to feel the effects of the slowdown predicted to sweep across the industry. </p> <p>It said sales in the third quarter had shot up 21% to \u00a3679.4m, helped by the economic recovery in Asia and Latin America, while net new billings were up 14% at \u00a3830m. </p> <p>Sir Martin Sorrell, WPP chief executive, said the company's growth rate excluding acquisitions was 15%, compared to an industry average of 7%. </p> <p>Last night he confirmed the company had held preliminary takeover talks with Finsbury and the Maitland Consultancy, two City-based public relations agencies, but said that no agreements had been reached. </p> <p>He also refused to be drawn on speculation WPP had been forced to widen its search for a new chairman to replace the retiring Hamish Maxwell. </p> <p>The list of potential Young &amp; Rubicam candidates had been exhausted. </p> <p>Sir Christopher Lewinton, the chairman of TI Group, is still understood to be on the list, despite some City dissatisfaction with the idea. </p> <p>\"We are looking at everyone,\" said Mr Sorrell. </p> <p>He said that an appointment would be made over the next couple of months. </p> <p>In its trading statement, WPP said major sporting and political occasions, coupled with better economic condi tions, had helped fuel the growth in revenues. </p> <p>The company, which also owns US agencies J Walter Thompson and Ogilvy &amp; Mather, is launching a new global network focusing on companies fighting for the lead position in their markets. </p> <p>The plan is for a joint venture between three of its agencies - Conquest, Batey Adver tising of Singapore and Seattle-based Cole &amp; Weber. </p> <p>WPP said revenues were up 34.3% in continental Europe, 24.8% in Asia, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East, while those in Britain had risen 11.2%.

  "Vice-President Al Gore entered the final fortnight of the election campaign yesterday behind in the polls and fighting battles on three fronts - struggling to motivate apathetic Democrats and trying to win over swing voters while fending off a radical challenge from Ralph Nader, the Green candidate. <p>By contrast, the Texas governor, George W Bush, is able to focus almost solely on undecided voters in a handful of swing states, in the knowledge that the Republican core electorate tends to turn out in greater numbers than its Democratic counterpart. </p> <p>In the crucial last days of the closest presidential race in four decades, Mr Bush can also draw on a bigger campaign chequebook, principally because of the record amount of \"soft money\" (unregulated donations to the political parties) raised by the Republican national committee in the past few months. </p> <p>All the major opinion polls yesterday gave Mr Bush a lead over the vice-president, but the margins differed widely. While a Gallup/CNN/USA Today poll had the Republican contender nine points ahead, surveys in the Washington Post and the New York Times showed a smaller, statistically insignificant, lead of only 2%. Pollsters observed that the margin was eroding as Mr Gore's abrasive performance in the debates receded. </p> <p>The tactical choices facing each candidate were reflected in their campaigns yesterday. Appearing in Kansas City, Missouri, under the banner \"barnstorming for reform\", Mr Bush stuck to his \"anti-establishment outsider\" theme, declaring: \"When I go to Washington, I won't be looking for arguments, I'll be looking for answers.\" </p> <p>The line has been market-tested among undecided voters, who pollsters found had negative reactions to the word \"Washington\". Meanwhile the Democratic party issued a new political broadcast attacking Mr Bush's record as Texas governor, especially in education. The advertisement claimed that 40% of Texas high school students fail to graduate. </p> <p>Democratic aides acknowledge that it is unusual to be so focused on specific issues so late in the election. The Gore campaign is now trying to win back voters who agree with the vice-president on the issues but were alienated by his hectoring performance in the first and third debates. </p> <p>At the same time the Gore camp is facing the possibility that Mr Nader, the Green party candidate, could draw away enough Democratic votes to swing the election in as many as six swing states. Although Mr Nader still has less than the 5% support needed to win federal funding in the next election, he poses a threat to Mr Gore in states where the environment is a leading issue, such as Oregon and Washington, or where leftwing populism is still strong, such as Wisconsin, Minnesota, Michigan and Maine. </p> <p>In response to this threat, the Gore camp has launched a rearguard campaign, portraying a vote for Mr Nader as a vote for Mr Bush.</p>",
  "Green groups waiting for Tony Blair's first speech on the environment in almost four years yesterday challenged the prime minister to admit that Labour had failed to advance many environmental issues since coming to power. <p>Charles Secrett, director of Friends of the Earth, said: \"He and his inner circle still think that the environmental agenda is against people, against science, against business and against the poor. It's a desperately outdated social democrat myth.\" </p> <p>Mr Blair promised in 1997 to \"put concern for the environment at the heart of Labour policy-making\", after criticising the Tories' environmental record. </p> <p>But he has turned to openly blaming major lobby groups for opposing him over GM, traffic reduction, fuel duties, waste, and road safety. He is widely expected to accuse the environment groups of \"dogma\" later today. </p> <p>One view, backed by No 10, is that Labour had too many other priorities, such as education and health, to deal with in their first term and would move firmly behind a fuller environmental agenda during a second term. </p> <p>But the goodwill on both sides has evaporated, with Mr Blair's advisers questioning green groups' authority and the groups in turn accusing him of running scared. </p> <p>Lord Melchett, director of Greenpeace, said : \"With John Prescott and Michael Meacher Labour has got the most committed environment team ever. Yet there's a view in certain parts of the party of environment being an old Labour preoccupation. It's so ignorant, it's hard to believe.\" </p> <p>\"It's been all spin without the substance\", a Green party spokesman said. </p> <p>\"Mr Blair appointed an oil mogul [Lord Simon of BP] as a minister of competitiveness and an avowed GM enthusiast [Lord Sainsbury] as a minister of science. </p> <p>\"He takes advice from people who would gain from not addressing environmental concerns. He has failed to address the social and economic cases for environmental policies.\" </p> <p>Lynn Sloman of Transport 2000 said: \"Labour started with a huge commitment to tackle transport but, although the department of the environment has done really good work, No 10 is now running scared of the extreme motorists' lobby\". </p> <p>Damian Green, the Conservative environment spokesman, yesterday praised Mr Meacher but said that \"when he goes up to Blair there's just nothing there. Blair doesn't think [environment] is an important issue.\" </p> <p>The specific charges are that Mr Blair and his close advisers have been more concerned with winning over the business community than with effecting real environmental improvements. The marginalisation of the environment came, they say, weeks after Mr Blair's only speech on the environment when he ditched the In Trust for Tomorrow policy paper which was considered progressive. </p> <p>Since then, Mr Blair and No 10 have scotched the fuel escalator tax, blocked minimal targets for traffic reduction and rejected a pesticide tax which would have penalised rich farmers. </p> <p>On GM, they say, Mr Blair's support for the controversial technology sought to appease the US and large companies over the genuine concerns of the majority of people. No 10 has also, they say, specifically said \"yes\" to heavier lorries and backed down on action to reduce speeds. </p> <p>They also accuse Mr Blair of running scared of tackling congestion, preferring to try to limit the growth in car numbers, reintroducing a road building policy by stealth and not recognising the potential of alternative energies. </p> <p>But there is widespread approval of the Department for the Environment, which has pushed through the wildlife and countryside bill which protects habitats and allows walkers access to hundreds of thousands of acres previously denied them. </p> <p>More surprisingly, there is growing support for the Treasury, which has introduced a series of environmental taxes, and the Department of Trade and Industry. </p> <p>Lord Melchett said: \"Until recently, the DTI was the evil empire, little better than under the Tories. </p> <p>\"But Stephen Byers has made some very significant shifts, even calling for a green industrial revolution.\" </p> <p><b>Labour's balance sheet</b></p> <p><b> Transport</b> </p> <p><b>For</b> The 10 year transport spending plan should eventually improve public transport and will make more money available for traffic management schemes.

The 10 year plan also raises the prospect of a return to widespread road building, which may be bitterly resisted by local communities. </p> <p><b> Food</b> </p> <p><b>For</b> The government has set up the independent food standards agency and tried to educate the public over nutrition. There has been a small rise in the level of support for organic farming and a glimmering of understanding that environmentally sensitive farming pays social and economic dividends. </p> <p><b> Against </b> Agriculture is in long-term crisis with the smallest farms going under. The government has consistently backed GM technology and is proceeding as fast as politically possible with its commercial development. </p> <p><b> Energy</b> </p> <p><b>For</b> The government announced a 10% target for renewable energy by 2010, a significant improvement on the previous government. </p> <p><b> Against</b> The 10% target is welcome but does not go nearly far enough. The Commons environment committee and Friends of the Earth have argued for a 20% target by 2010. </p> <p><b> Wildlife and countryside</b> </p> <p><b>For</b> Labour's significant green contribution should now go through parliament early next month. The countryside and rights of way bill gives legal protection to Britain's finest wildlife sites. There has also been action to defend peatlands. </p> <p><b> Economy</b> </p> <p><b>For</b> Labour, says Friends of the Earth, has begun to understand the idea that the quality of economic growth matters, not just its quantity. The 1999 Budget contained more than 20 green measures: taxes on pollution and waste, and reduced taxes on employment. There have also been moves towards putting taxes on aggregates, landfill and company cars. </p> <p><b>Climate change</b> </p> <p><b>For</b> Tony Blair is credited with taking a lead on reducing carbon emissions, the main greenhouse warming gas. Labour has promised to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 2010 by 20% from 1990 levels. The government eventually gave tacit support to the warm homes bill, designed to end the scandal of fuel poverty and excess winter deaths. </p> <p><b> Against </b> The government is likely to fail to meet its 20% target. Ministers failed to argue the climate case during the recent fuel protests. </p> <p><b> Pollution and health</b> </p> <p><b>For</b> The government has produced the first targets for household recycling. </p> <p><b> Against </b> The government has also left the door open for dozens of new waste incinerators that are bitterly opposed by communities nearby.</p>",

  "Judy Fryd, who has died aged 90, would not take no for answer. This was a vital trait for the woman who altered the public's perception of learning disability. Judy Fryd sowed the seeds of Mencap, now the largest disability organisation in the country. <p>Although modest in private, in public Fryd was a dynamic campaigner for children and adults with learning disabilities - people considered 50 years ago as \"backward\". Today, a person with a learning disability serves on the recently formed Disability Rights Commission and many of those previously in long-stay \"sub-normality\" hospitals now live independently. The Disability Discrimination Act has further strengthened the rights of disabled people, though the fight is far from over. </p> <p>Much of this change is largely due to Fryd, who along with a group of fellow parents, banded together more than 50 years ago to form the Association of Parents of Backward Children. This organisation evolved to become the Royal Society for Mentally Handicapped Children and Adults in the 1980s, better known as Mencap. </p> <p>Born in Hornsey, London, the daughter of a post-office sorter, Fryd was educated at Minchenden School, Southgate and Ruskin College, Oxford, where she met her husband John Fryd: they both read economics and political science. They married in London in 1936 and moved to Leeds, where Fryd gave birth to their first child, Felicity, in 1938. When Felicity showed signs of slow development, Judy and John sought help. It was a frustrating search. After only half a day at a mainstream primary school she was rejected as being too disruptive. </p> <p>Later, although found a suitable placement, she was deemed \"not suitable\" and her immediate removal was requested. She was summarily returned to her family who were left to cope alone with her autism and challenging behaviour (then described as juvenile schizophrenia). The lack of understanding from society and the professionals who were supposed to support her angered Fryd. </p> <p>Her initial step, in 1946, was to respond to a letter in Nursery World magazine which asked if there were other parents struggling to cope with a learning-disabled child at home. Fryd suggested that she and other parents of such children should band together in an effort to receive some kind of recognition - and amelioration - of their desperate plight. Within a month more than 1,000 parents, largely mothers, had joined forces. </p> <p>Throughout the 50s and 60s, Fryd promoted and researched the needs and potential of people with learning disabilities. She was editor of Parents' Voice for over 25 years. This monthly magazine enabled parents to keep in touch, spread information and rally for positive action. It also helped parents overcome the supposed shame of having a learning-disabled child. </p> <p>At home, the Fryds were a musical family. Felicity, known by her family as Filly, participated fully within this musical environment, where she would twirl around in circles dancing to Fryd's accomplished piano playing. Along with the rest of the family, Filly had perfect pitch, and her outbursts were often affectionately referred to as her \"arias\". </p> <p>Fryd led a campaign which resulted in the 1971 Education (Handicapped Children) Act, overturning the previous thinking that children with a learning disability were ineducable. Until then, parents had to find (and pay for) private education; even so, the children were denied post-war support such as free school milk and vitamin supplements. If private schooling was unavailable or too costly, parents had to look after their son or daughter at home. Or they were certified as mentally defective and dispatched to an NHS long-stay sub-normality hospital. </p> <p>Although most of what Fryd fought for came too late for her own daughter to benefit, she saw her tiny association grow into Mencap, with a turnover of \u00a3100m, 5,500 staff and more than 20,000 volunteers. Today people with learning disabilities serve on the board of trustees, which was unthinkable even 10 years ago. Fryd was positive about Mencap's most recent changes, and felt it made sense to have one-third of its national assembly being people with learning disabilities. </p> <p>A lifelong member of the Labour Party, Fryd was honoured at the 1991 annual conference in Brighton for outstanding voluntary service to the party. She was a vice-president of Mencap for the last 20 years. </p> <p>Fryd's husband died in 1981. She is survived by two daughters and a son, and her only grandchild, Elly, born in 1969, who lived with her for the last 10 years. Fryd's daughter Felicity died in 1993.</p>",
  "<p>Brindishe Community School in Lee, south-east London, is an open plan design with interconnecting rooms arranged in a square around a central courtyard. </p> <p>The headteacher, Vicki Paterson, agrees that the layout, with no locked doors, could be many teachers' worst nightmare but, she says, it has a positive effect. Damage and theft in particular are almost unheard of - since everything is freely accessible, there is no need to steal. </p> <p>The noise levels, too, are surprisingly low for 250 children - and there is no shouting by teachers. The children are encouraged to use all available space and so, once they have been given their tasks, they can move from their own classroom to wherever suits them best. </p> <p>Using the style of teaching imposed by the school itself as a starting point, the staff at Brindishe began looking into brain research, to see how children learn. Six years ago, Paterson and her deputy head, Pauline Jackson, attended a talk by Ian Gilbert of Independent Thinking, a company he set up to enrich the lives of young people by changing the way they think. Inspired by talk of treating the brain as a muscle and giving it exercise, and of how we learn, their interest then led them to the work of Alistair Smith. </p> <p>Built up from published research and books and articles on neuroscience and psychology, Smith developed an accelerated learning cycle. According to research, MRI scans have shown how brain activity slows down when a person feels fear, cold, hunger, etc. When physical needs are met, brain activity speeds up. </p> <p>Exam situations tend to be fairly traumatic, but at Brindishe, they have used this research to make exams almost enjoyable. During recent Sats, the pupils arrived at school to the sound of music - mostly Mozart, which has been shown to create a calm atmosphere and to increase output. The scent of citrus also pervaded the school to help keep little heads clear and a tray of food was provided to make sure there were no hungry tums. \"Live food\" - fruit and raw vegetables - as \"dead food\" would divert necessary energy for digestion, slowing down the brain. The school also provided bottled water for each child, to stop the brain cells from drying out. The 11-year-olds had a great time, and results were excellent. </p> <p>Brindishe also uses exercises as a break during classes as, according to research, the maximum amount of time a child will be paying full attention is his or her age plus two minutes. Thus a teacher of a class of seven-year-olds will have nine minutes of optimum teaching time. The rest of the period will be introducing the subject, getting feedback, and a break for some brain gym. Brain gym, which has been proved to be particularly useful in working with children of special needs, involves getting both sides of the brain working together through physical exercises - movements such as tapping the top of the head with the left hand and rubbing the stomach with the right hand. This all helps to get oxygen flowing round the brain again. </p> <p>Attention has also been paid to the different ways children learn. In explaining how the earth moves round the sun, some children will take the information in kinaesthetically, through \"feeling\". They will have to be the earth spinning around a friend (the sun) for it to make sense. Others will understand through seeing the demonstration. Still others will only need to hear it, and some will need to write the lesson down and read it for themselves. The teachers incorporate each of these methods into the class, making sure everyone has understood in their own way. </p> <p>The teachers and parents are also happy to try less scientific ways of improving the children's wellbeing. All around the school are special touches - for example the children's toilets. The parents came in and painted them sky blue, adding Matisse prints and plants and mirrors. And the children keep them clean and tidy, like the rest of the premises. There is also a pink box where children can put notes, anonymously if they wish - especially in the case of bullying - and the teachers will gently investigate. </p> <p>The staff are all prepared to put in extra time and effort as the environment makes for satisfied teachers, too, and keeps the school in Ofsted's top 3%. Pass that citrus oil, I'm off to listen to some Mozart. </p> <p> \u0095 Ian Gilbert, Independent Thinking, tel: 01604 497749; email: <a href=\"mailto:learn@independentthinking.ltd.uk\"> learn@independentthinking.ltd.uk</a>.

  "<p>Peer into the playground at Rowlatts Hill Primary in Leicester this week, and you'll see lots of new play equipment. If it's break-time, you may also notice the children munching apples in place of biscuits. The changes are just two of the school's latest improvements: but they haven't come from the staff, or even the parents. At the 300-pupil school, it's the kids who are in the hotseat when it comes to making the place better. </p> <p>They haven't got carte blanche on everything, of course (although I have it on the highest authority - one of them - that curriculum worries are next in line for consideration). What it's all about, says the head, Jonathan Evans, is taking children's views seriously via an elected school council. </p> <p>Pupil democracy isn't exactly new - look at Summerhill School, the Suffolk independent school that trail-blazed it decades ago - but it is edging up the agenda, and there's some evidence that the Department for Education and Employment may be about to take it more seriously. Peter Facey, chief executive at the British Youth Council, is in discussion with the department about funding for a body to bring together pupil councils nationwide. \"What we're talking to the government about is the fact that, with voting figures on the decline, introducing pupil councils into schools may be one important way of giving young people enthusiasm for participating in the political process,\" he says. </p> <p>The recent, and much-publicised, report into multi-ethnic Britain provided more evidence of a renewed interest in \"pupil power\". The report, which expressed grave concerns about the treatment of ethnic minorities in schools, praised as most successful those schools it dubbed \"listening schools\" - such schools, it said, \"took time to talk with students ... and took seriously the views students and parents offered ...\" Schools that took pupils' views seriously, it concluded, were less likely to need to use exclusion as a sanction, and were more likely to have staff and strategies in place to deal with tensions. </p> <p>Around 50% of secondary schools and 25% of primaries already have a council - although not all are as effective as Rowlatts Hill in giving youngsters a real say. Facey says: \"I've known schools that let the children debate litter control in the playground, and that's about it. But that sort of thing will only increase their cynicism - they've got to feel they are being listened to, and that their views are making a difference.\" </p> <p>Somehow the idea of school councils seems oddly out of step with the flavour of education in Britain today. We're all aware of the current of authoritarianism at the heart of the government's reforms: sitting in rows and getting back to basics on the three Rs doesn't seem to fit with giving youngsters the right to speak out about things they don't like, still less to actually change them. </p> <p>So what's going on? Why is it that pupil councils are a feature of life in an increasing number of schools, and are increasingly effective? Partly, perhaps, it's a backlash against the authoritarianism of the reforms themselves: partly, it's about a general extension of children's rights, particularly in the western world. But partly, too, it's a response to what might seem like a minor reform planned for our schools in 2002, when citizenship becomes a mandatory subject for secondary school pupils and an optional extra for primaries. After all, say the proponents of school councils, if we're teaching our children about rights, participation and democracy, surely there could be no better way than by putting the whole notion into practice in their most immediate community? </p> <p>Derry Hannam, a teacher for more than 20 years and now an educational consultant and adviser to the DfEE, is convinced that pupil power is vitally important. \"Children have a right to be heard, although that's never been a particularly prominent or acceptable position to take in this country,\" he says. Indeed, one only has to look at the treatment meted out to Summerhill to see quite how unpopular this trend has been in Britain: the tabloid press seems obsessed with the idea of kids ruling the roost and making a hash of things. </p> <p>In fact, says Hannam, the very reverse would seem to be the case. \"School councils are actually a very effective way to improve things,\" he says. \"Children know a lot about what's working in a school, as well as what's going on generally.\" When it comes to change, kids are often a lot wiser than a lot of grown-ups might think - take that decision to ban biscuits in favour of apples, for example. </p> <p>What's more, says Hannam, \"Giving children a voice raises their self-esteem and self-image as learners, which in turn enhances attainment.\" </p> <p>Then there's that curriculum change to include citizenship. \"There are some things that can only be learned through participation, and that includes democracy,\" says Hannam. \"One of the main ideas behind the addition of citizenship to the curriculum is that children should develop participation skills and learn how to act as citizens, and you can only develop these by participating and taking action. There's a mountain of research that shows you can't just lecture about democracy: it's simply in one ear and out the other.\" </p> <p>Not so at Cotham School in Bristol, where the student council has been in place for three years since the appointment of the head, James Wetz, another firm believer in pupil democracy. Cotham is an 11-18 co-educational school with 1,240 pupils on its roll: the council is made up of 100 councillors representing each tutor group in the school. </p> <p>The council is chaired by two sixth-formers, and two of its members are observers on the governing body, where they have a voice if not a vote. They can listen to most business though they have to withdraw before confidential issues are raised. Council meetings are held every five weeks, and aren't seen at Cotham as an optional extra: they're held in lesson-time, important enough for the pupil-councillors to miss a class. </p> <p>Council members also sit on five action teams, which cover the school's catering, facilities, environment, equal rights and charity work. Each team has the support of a teacher, and secretarial and organisational back-up is provided by a parent volunteer. Wetz attends council meetings and hears all the debate and decisions: at a recent meeting, he says, he was struck by a child's remark that \"in the hands of the few, power corrupts\". </p> <p>Like Rowlatts Hill, Cotham has been changed by its student council: it had a role, for example, in awarding the school's catering contract, and Wetz was impressed at how seriously the children took the task of visiting another school to see the would-be caterer in action, and how closely they vetted the contract. Fears that power devolved to children is power unappreciated seem groundless: if anything, kids seem to take decisions more seriously. </p> <p>On the whole, says Wetz, the council has been widely admired and welcomed, and there have been few criticisms - just one or two from parents concerned at children missing lessons for council meetings. He makes no apologies for this: to be given its proper importance, attendance at a democratic gathering must take priority over other work for its members. </p> <p>The years of the council's existence have coincided with a steady and significant climb in the school's academic results, and Wetz describes its latest GCSE and key stage 3 results as excellent. There are a few things he's not entirely happy about - wider participation in the council by other pupils, and children's frustration at not being able to change things overnight - but in general pupil democracy at Cotham works well. </p> <p>Indeed, if it doesn't work well, schools could be doing their pupils more harm than good. According to Hannam, there's nothing quite so guaranteed to lead to cynicism about democracy than a pupil council that's not taken seriously, or which doesn't genuinely allow students' views to make a difference. And with citizenship about to appear on the curriculum, that would seem to be an indefensible mistake for any school to be making. </p> <p> <strong>What the pupils think: </strong><br></p> <p><strong> Rowlatts Hill Primary </strong><br></p> <p><strong>Elise Blockley, 8</strong> </p> <p>It's been fun looking at the brochures to see what we'd like to have in the playground.

  "<p>Last week's announcement that, from 2002, all five-year-olds would be set a compulsory test sparked a furore. Tabloid newspapers immediately offered parents (conflicting) advice on how to get their five-year-olds through the test, while parents' groups expressed concern about this additional pressure on children and dismissed it as \"yet another move towards selection\". </p> <p>So, should parents be worried - is this testing gone mad? The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA), which made the announcement, was keen to reassure parents. They studiously avoided using the word \"test\", preferring the more neutral \"baseline assessment\", and emphasised that nothing was set in stone - a consultation process was under way that would include parents. </p> <p>The assessment of young children is, they added, nothing new. Children as young as four have been tested for 10 years. What is happening now is simply a rationalisation of the existing system. Under the new proposals, all schools will use the same assessment method (at present over 90 different schemes are in use) and all children will be tested at the same point in their school career - at the end of the recently introduced \"foundation stage\" of the national curriculum, when they are five (at present, children can be assessed at any time during their first year at school). </p> <p>On the ground, however, the worry feels real enough. Angus Pryor has a four-year-old who has just started school in Kent. His son, Hal, is to be assessed this term, and the school's description of the tests awaiting him provided little reassurance. </p> <p>\"It's only just dawned on me what the assessment is,\" said Angus. \"My concern is they are going to test in a very academic way. At the parents' evening where we were told about the assessment, I asked how Hal was doing creatively and socially. They had nothing to say on that. But we were told about the need to prepare even the youngest children for the 11-plus. It felt like our four-year-old was being set up for selection already. I don't really care if he can form a 'C' just yet; I simply want him to be happy.\" </p> <p>Other parents contacted by the Guardian shared Angus's concerns. \"I don't want him to be in an overly academic environment,\" says Iona Gibson, whose five-year-old son John started school in south London this term and is currently being assessed. </p> <p>\"There doesn't seem to be any singing or playing any more. It's all heads down now that John's left the nursery.\" Gibson admits that part of her concern is a lack of information . </p> <p>\"I don't know what he's doing, I don't know how much to worry.\" John doesn't appear to have been bothered by the assessments, she says, but, like a lot of parents of very young children, she feels left out of the information loop. \"Does this mean that they are going to stream my child?\" she asks. </p> <p>The answer is almost certainly no. Desk setting, where children work together in ability groups, does happen in primary schools, but not with the youngest children and not for all of the time. But it is hardly surprising that she is worried. </p> <p>\"'Test' is a very emotive term,\" says Pat Wills, who chairs Early Education, an organisation of educators who specialise in children of this age. Wills is also headteacher of Claremont Primary School in Blackpool. \"These aren't sit-down examinations, they're based on observation of what a child can do carried out over several days.\" </p> <p>And tots will not face a test in their first week in school as some of the tabloids alleged. \"The assessment will come at the end of the foundation stage,\" said Pat Wills, which for some children could be up to two years into school. Pat Wills is supportive of the proposed national system. It is good for the child, she insists, because now all children will have had at least one year's schooling before they are assessed. And the information will help teachers target their teaching. </p> <p>\"You can't work without some understanding of a child's stage of development,\" she says. \"High-flyers may be able to read at four, but some others will never have handled a book. Teachers need this knowledge.\" </p> <p>And it is also good news for schools, especially those in poorer areas. Baseline assessments are an essential part of the value-added measures that ministers hope will eventually replace league tables based on raw examination results. It is believed that many schools in leafy areas are \"coasting\", achieving good results - and good reputations - simply as a result of the background of their children, rather than from teaching excellence. For value-added information to be complete, some assessment needs to be made at the start of a child's school career. </p> <p>Claremont primary is unusual in having a leading early years specialist like Wills as a headteacher. Not surprisingly, perhaps, the school has gone to greater lengths than many to ensure the foundation stage curriculum and baseline assessments work well. It restructured the early years setting ready for the new foundation curriculum this September, with three classrooms for the youngest children and new staff to support the teaching. </p> <p>\"We've had the national curriculum for 10 years,\" says Wills. \"But there's always been a grey area about when it started. The foundation stage clarifies that they don't start until year 1, giving over a year of school time without things like the literacy hour to pressure the children's day.\" </p> <p>Claremont's three classrooms are full of toys, books and games, but each focuses on different aspects of learning. Some parents are concerned that children aren't moving onto \"proper learning\", but the school firmly believes that structured play is the best learning environment for the four- and five-year-old. </p> <p>A key factor in its success are the two nursery nurses attached to each classroom. \"Here we have a staff:pupil ratio of 1:12,\" says Wills. The extra staff make the observation and monitoring involved in the new baseline tests easier to manage, but Claremont's nursery nurses have not been funded from additional government money. Wills claims that there has been no central government support. </p> <p>\"Absolutely no money whatsoever,\" she says. \"We've had good training from the local education authority, but we've had the find the money for our nursery nurses from our own resources.\" </p> <p>Yet early years is the one area where research has shown clear benefits from smaller classes. A study by London's Institute of Education published this year revealed impressive learning gains for five-year-olds taught in smaller classes. </p> <p>Wills would like to see more money pumped into provision for the youngest children along with a drive to inform parents about the changes. \"Some parents are desperate for their child to begin reading from day one,\" she said. Others are concerned about an early academic diet. </p> <p>But an equal concern is the question of how many schools will follow Claremont's example. The Blackpool primary is a very large school where economies of scale allow the kind of staffing that many rural schools would find too costly. Few heads are early years specialists and there may well be pressure on reception class teachers to implement the kind of academic regime that worries many parents. Will schools be able to run the new tests in the unobtrusive, diagnostic way that Wills argues should be the norm? </p> <p>Iona Gibson has just one priority: \"I just think that play is so important,\" she says. \"That and the opportunity for him to settle into the school environment and enjoy himself.\" </p> <p> <strong>What a five-year-old should be able to do</strong><br></p> <p> This is not a 'test' with right and wrong answers, but a way of assessing each child's development in a number of areas - from basic to more advanced understanding. <br> </p> <p><strong> Reading</strong> Basic level: do they hold a book correctly and understand about turning pages? Difficult level: can they read a familiar book accurately? </p> <p><strong> Writing</strong> Basic: do they know the difference between pictures and text?

Difficult: Can they add and subtract to a total of 10? </p> <p><strong> Mathematical language</strong> Basic: Can they use paired words like larger/smaller? Difficult: Can they use words like 'plus', 'add' and 'equals'?</p> <p> <strong> Speaking and listening</strong> Basic: Can they describe two events or experiences? Difficult: Can they tell a story they have made up themselves? </p> <p><strong> Understanding sounds</strong> Basic: Can they recite a nursery rhyme? Difficult: Can they write letters to match the sounds of some simple words? </p> <p><strong> Personal development</strong> Basic: Do they play with others? Difficult: Can they have a conversation with adults where they express opinions and ideas?</p>"
