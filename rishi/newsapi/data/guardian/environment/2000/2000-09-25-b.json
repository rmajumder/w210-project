  "<p>RWE, the German utility, could make further acquisitions of British companies and start selling gas and electricity in the UK after clinching an agreed \u00a34.3bn cash takeover of Thames Water yesterday. </p> <p>The Essen-based utility, one of Europe's big six, said it was \"still on a growth path\" and had amassed a \u00a315bn war chest to grow outside Germany. Chairman Dr Dietmar Kuhnt said it would need to digest Thames before making any immediate moves but would take advantage of opportunities as they came up . </p> <p>RWE is already in advanced talks about delivering gas and electricity to its water customers in Berlin where it works in partnership with Vivendi of France. The deal will create the world's third largest water and waste company. Thames has been considering cross-selling other services to its London and southeast England water users like other companies such as Centrica and Scottish Power. </p> <p>A Thames spokeswoman said: \"It's a natural development to bundle things up and get better value for the customers. We are looking at that in Berlin and will be looking at that here longer term.\" </p> <p>But Mr Kuhnt was anxious to stress the global ambitions of Thames under RWE where it will challenge France's Vivendi Environment and Suez Lyonnaise des Eaux. </p> <p>German financial muscle will be put behind Thames' management and growing ambitions in key markets such as the US and South America where it has just bought a Chilean company. </p> <p>The agreed offer for Thames is \u00a312.15 per share, and RWE will assume \u00a32.5bn of Thames debt including its uncompleted US water acquisition E'town. Thames shareholders will also get an interim dividend of 20p per share for the year to March 2001 and a scheduled final dividend of 32.7p to March 2000. </p> <p>Both Mr Kuhnt and Thames chief executive Bill Alexander described the deal as generous. Analysts agreed, pointing out that the Germans were paying a premium of 43% to Thames' average share price over the last month. Thames shares ended the day up 50p at 1210p while RWE shares continued a slide that began when the talks were first mooted. </p> <p>RWE brokers Merrill Lynch bought 20% of Thames yesterday to \"cement the relationship\" rather than ward off any attempt by a third party predator to upset their new partnership. The German group said putting the two companies together was an \"excellent strategic fit\" with no overlap and therefore no job losses. </p> <p>Senior management at Thames has agreed to stay on and the combined water operations are to be based in London under Mr Alexander. It will operate under the title Thames Water, a division of RWE and have 34m customers from London to Shanghai. </p> <p>Thames chairman Roger Carr, who will bow out within 50 days after the deal is completed, said RWE backing gave Thames the kind of financial strength it needed to realise its international ambitions fully. \"Its a win-win for both parties,\" he said. \"As part of the RWE group, Thames Water's position and prospects will be strengthened and the opportunities open to its employees will be much enhanced.\" </p> <p>There are many areas of consolidation in the water industry worldwide. Some industry experts warned that it was still a highly competitive market, pointing out that US-based Azurix, owner of Wessex Water in the UK, was spun off from its parent, the power group Enron, at $19 per share but its price has fallen to $5.</p>",
  "The government will not embark on an \"irresponsible\" pre-election spending spree, Gordon Brown told the Labour party conference this afternoon. <p>The chancellor vowed there would be no return to the \"short-termism\" of previous Tory governments as a coalition of farmers, pensioners and countryside campaigners demonstrated noisily outside the party conference in Brighton.</p> <p>Labour had won economic stability and sustainable growth by resisting short-term lurches in policy, he said - a blow to many, including some Labour party members, who had hoped for a cut in fuel duty and flat-rate rise in pensions as the government fights to regain its lead in the polls.</p> <p>Mr Brown gave a blunt warning that he would not change policy.\"There will be no relaxing of our fiscal rules. We will not put the hard-won Labour economic stability at risk. No return to short-termism. No return to Tory boom and bust.\" </p> <p>Earlier in the day, party activists had called on the government to restore the link the between pensions and earnings. At a packed fringe meeting today, veteran left-wing MP Tony Benn told delegates that that pensioners have a right to share in \"rising wealth\" to which they have contributed.</p> <p>Much to their dismay - but probably not surprise - Mr Brown ruled out an across-the-board rise in the state pension. </p> <p>\"It's precisely because, with your support, we have resisted short-term lurches in policy that we can today steer a course of stability at a time of uncertainty in the world economy, without putting growth at risk,\" he told delegates.</p> <p>The chancellor acknowledged that the government had \"much more to do\" on pensions but defended the policy of targeting the poorest. \"It is a progressive principle that we should do more for those who have the greatest needs. So if we are to plan for the future, our priority cannot be that the wealthiest get exactly the same as the neediest,\" he said. </p> <p>On fuel, Mr Brown said he understood the difficulties many people faced with high petrol prices, and promised to deal with it. However, he said he would work towards international pressure to step up oil production and lower its price on the world markets in preference to cutting tax. </p> <p>The chancellor also confirmed that there would be no change in the government's policy on the euro. But in a break with his previous dry and \"prudent\" public performances, the chancellor made a lengthy attack on Michael Portillo, his Tory shadow, and on the Tory leader, William Hague. Mr Brown said that Mr Portillo had been in the Treasury during the final cycles of \"Tory boom and bust\" - and in the Department of the Environment when the then prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, was introducing the unpopular poll tax. </p> <p>And all this time, he said, Mr Hague was \"drinking 14 pints\" - to laughter from the floor.</p>",
  "<p>As I get older and perhaps wiser, I realise more and more what I do not know. I still don't know what makes people happy although I am a good deal more knowledgeable about what makes them sad. I don't know now whether there is a God, when once I did believe and with a passionate conviction. I don't know whether good mothers are born or made, what turns some people into leaders and others into the led, nor whether in my lifetime we will see the cure for cancer, schizophrenia or Alzheimer's disease. </p> <p> What I do know is what it is like to be a man. However, as I reflect on how I learned about masculinity and manhood, I realise that almost all the teaching was implicit and all the learning by way of a kind of osmotic process. I don't recall anyone, my father, my mother, my teachers, my peers, saying 'This is what it means to be a man, a son, a brother, a lover, a dad'. Yet I learned very early on that what a man does; his work is as important as, even more important than, who he is; that a man is defined in modern capitalistic society in terms not of being but doing. </p> <p> My career, particularly my medical career, was always portrayed and interpreted, by others as much as by myself, as more important than spouse, family, friends. During my undergraduate and postgraduate training, first in medicine, then in psychiatry, I never ever witnessed a male colleague admitting to putting his family first. Male colleagues would blithely arrange late evening meetings of this or that committee and be surprised and irritated when female colleagues pointed out that domestic duties made their attendance impossible. For a male to make such a statement would have marked him as someone not committed to his job. Most male colleagues were busy demonstrating how they worked all the hours God gave them. It was like chimps beating their chests and baring their teeth. Often, it was just about as productive. </p> <p> In an interview published in the New York Times back in 1912, Carl Jung observed that the libido of American men: </p> <p>is focused almost entirely on his business, so that as a husband he is glad to have no responsibilities. He gives the complete direction of his family life over to his wife. This is what you call giving independence to the American woman. It is what I call the laziness of the American man. That is why he is so kind and polite in his home and why he can fight so hard in his business. His real life is where his fight is. The lazy part of his life is where his family is. Jung was writing of American men at the turn of the last century. He could as easily have been writing of manhood, career and family life some 80 years later. He certainly could have been writing about mine. Yet, given the nature and extent of the feminist analysis and the sexual revolution of the second half of the twentieth century, much would appear to have changed for - women. But what has happened to men? </p> <p> As a young psychiatrist in the late 1960s and 1970s I regularly encountered the phenomenon then known as the 'empty-nest syndrome'. It afflicted married women who, having given their lives to the rearing of their families, found when they reached their fifties that their children had grown up and gone and their spouses were off living a life of work and golf. Now, in the 1990s, I don't see so many women from empty nests. Rather I see middle-aged men, who gave their lives loyally to this company or that corporation, who sacrificed everything for it, now ruthlessly put out to grass, compulsorily retired, downsized, rendered redundant. Bewildered, they look around but their children have flown and their spouses are otherwise occupied. It is the women who now play the golf, who have jobs and friends at work. It is the men who cower in the empty nest, nervously facing what an eloquent Irish businessman friend has termed 'the forgotten future'. </p> <p> From the outset of public life as a male - at school, university, medical school, debating union, postgraduate research centre, hospital - I learned to compete and pretend to a confidence I didn't often (didn't ever) feel. That is what men are required to do. As a result, one of the commonest fears of mature men is that they will be 'found out' in some mysterious fashion. As a young father, I shouted at my children in order to feel powerful, and covertly and sometimes overtly declared that manly boys didn't complain but had to be strong and responsible and suppress vulnerability, particularly if they were to avoid being bullied by other boys. As a young husband, I loved my wife and was, or so I believed, a sympathetic and liberated 'new' male. Now I am not so sure. She sacrificed much to be a committed and full-time mother. I sacrificed little to be a peripheral and very part-time dad. But I was the family provider and that counted for a great deal - to me at any rate - and I was a father to my children, even if I would have been hard put to define precisely what being a father was. </p> <p> Now, the whole issue of men - the point of them, their purpose, their value, their justification - is a matter for public debate. Serious commentators declare that men are redundant, that women do not need them and children would be better off without them. At the beginning of the twenty-first century it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that men are in serious trouble. Throughout the world, developed and developing, antisocial behaviour is essentially male. Violence, sexual abuse of children, illicit drug use, alcohol misuse, gambling all are overwhelmingly male activities. The courts and prisons bulge with men. When it comes to aggression, delinquent behaviour, risk taking and social mayhem, men win gold. </p> <p> And yet, for all their behaving badly, they do not seem any the happier. Throughout North America, Europe and Australia, male suicides outnumber female by a factor of between 3 and 4 to 1. The rise in the number of young men killing themselves in much of the developed world has been rightly termed an epidemic. For the old, the situation is no better. For every 6 elderly women in every 100,000 who kill themselves each year, 40 elderly men take their own lives. And these suicide figures are viewed as the tip of an iceberg of male depression, an iceberg hidden only because men are seen to be either too proud or too emotionally constipated to admit when their feelings are out of control. Men renowned for their ability and inclination to be stoned, drunk or sexually daring, appear terrified by the prospect of revealing that they can be - and often are - depressed, dependent, in need of help. </p> <p> It will be said that it has always been thus and that all that is changing is that men are coming out of the emotional closet. Men, so this argument goes, having ridiculed, demeaned and patronised women's supposed emotionality, now accept the importance, the maturity, of not merely acknowledging feelings but expressing them in a civilised and open way. </p> <p> Others argue that there is a genuine rise in male dissatisfaction for which there is no shortage of suggested causes. Top of the list is the growing assertiveness of women. As a consequence of the feminist revolution, so this argument goes, women are no longer prepared to be the property of patriarchal men. In this feminist revolution, male power is being overthrown. Men, like colonists seeing their empire crumble, don't like what is happening. Few women have much time for such an argument. After all, the gains that have accrued to women remain pretty miserly. Men still outnumber women in positions of power across the globe, still glower downwards through the glass ceiling, still strut the cabinet and boardrooms in every developed country in the world, the seeming masters of their fate and everybody else's. In the developing world the situation is even more unequal. The gender disparity in sharing the burden of unpaid work is stark, and for all the talk of equality women throughout the world continue to work longer hours than men and are paid very much less for it. The colonists are still in command. </p> <p> In the circumstances, female impatience with male sensitivities is understandable. But it may be missing the point. It is true that patriarchy has not been overthrown. But its justification is in disarray. The colonists have not been displaced but the colonised are planning, discussing, organising, and, in a number of small, well-planned uprisings, have demonstrated their capability. There is a sense, certainly in the outlying areas of the patriarchal empire, that the time for male authority, dominance and control is up. Beneath the surface, male power is being subverted. Throughout Europe - in primary schools, through secondary education and right into the universities - girls are outperforming boys. In the European Union, 20 per cent more women are graduating than men. On leaving school and university, women's prospects of employment exceed men's. In Germany, for example, between 1991 and 1995 twice as many men as women lost their jobs. Women actually gained 210,000 jobs while men lost 400,000. Some teenage boys reassure themselves that later on, in their twenties and thirties, the right order reasserts itself, and men regain their rightful place - on top. But that reassurance, for a variety of reasons, is sounding increasingly hollow. Women are on the march and, even if they still have a long way to go, many men, already threatened, are reacting with aggression directed at women and at themselves. </p> <p> And if changes in education, training and work are not sufficient to demoralise the average man, there is the sorry, dismal, public soap opera of man's relationship with his penis. Men, who in most other areas of their lives make such a fetish of being in control, seem unable to remain masters of their sexual appetites. More darkly, there is little respite from exposure to the more savage side of male sexuality - rape, molestation, sexual violence - manifested overwhelmingly in aggression by men against women and children. Not surprisingly, many innocent men, like the relatives of torturers and killers, find themselves apologising for crimes they have not themselves committed. </p> <p> But are men fearful of their feelings and, if they are, have they good reason to be? Do men feel contempt for women and, if they do, what is fuelling such contempt? It has been argued that misogyny, the hatred of women, is an inescapable element in the development of men and that, quite simply, there are no good men. Might the fear and contempt be related to a deeper fear, a more profound anxiety about male sexuality itself? Here one is treading on dangerous ground. Put a foot wrong and one risks being accused of blaming women for men's inability to control their sexual feelings and to harness their aggression. That is what many men believe and some act upon it. Women are feared, despised and sometimes even destroyed because of what men perceive women to be doing to them. To such men, their own sexuality is exciting precisely because it is unpredictable, capricious, dangerous - and women end up being blamed for provoking it. To such men, women, by their very presence, represent a most disturbing challenge to self-control. Given the extent to which control is for many men the defining mark of their masculinity, any suggestion or threat of being out of control challenges the very essence of what being a male is all about. Bill Clinton's sexual behaviour revealed that the Garden of Eden myth is alive and well and flourishing in the heart of the American empire. Men fall because women tempt them. This remains the explanation of male sexual behaviour most favoured by men. Rather than expose to a genuinely rigorous analysis the nature of male sexuality and its relationship to power, social status, aggression and control, most male commentators retreat into a self-pitying and ultimately depressing moan about the difficulty of being a full-bloodedly sexual man in a dynamic relationship with a woman in the new post-feminist world of gender equality. </p> <p> In an interview with Germaine Greer in 1989 I wondered whether she accepted that behind the bluster and the posturing many men were not really as confident as they might appear. 'I don't care much about phallic insecurity', she tartly replied, adding that, after all, men created the dream of the phallus. It's men who are worried about whether the phallic department is adequate. The women are perfectly happy with all the other stuff - with social status, power, intelligence. She is absolutely right. Men do remain preoccupied with 'whether the phallic department is adequate'. They worry about the size, shape and erectile potential of their genitalia. Men, young and old, are disconcerted by mocking references to what Sylvia Plath dismissively referred to as 'old turkey neck and gizzards'. The highly successful British film, The Full Monty, explicitly drew an analogy between male inadequacy consequent on the loss of a job and male anxiety concerning genital potency. Men must bond, share, emotionally relate, must reveal themselves in full nakedness to each other and to women if they are to be fully human; so went the movie's message. Then came the ultimate copout in which everything was indeed revealed to the cinema audience - save 'old turkey neck and gizzards'! </p> <p> Male preoccupation with their penises would appear to be based on fear, right enough: not on the Freudian fear of castration, but on the Adlerian fear of ridicule. Are we up to it? ask today's men anxiously, peering at their shrivelled cocks and analysing their social skills; are we up to competing, succeeding, achieving, conquering, controlling, asserting, pontificating, as well as getting it up? And there is of course the unavoidable gender inequality, the fact that, unlike the female orgasm, the male erection cannot be faked. The obvious visibility of the male genital organs, their state and size, roused and flaccid, are readily measurable and comparable. Hardly surprising, therefore, that the arrival of Viagra has been accompanied not merely by dodgy humour and gruesome double entendres but also by po-faced and panicky political discussions about the possible bankrupting of health finances due to a stampede by men to get their hands on the latest 'old turkey gizzard' stimulant. </p> <p> The one biological difference between the sexes on which everybody is agreed is that whereas women possess two X-shaped sex chromosomes, men possess one X and a little Y-shaped chromosome. The Y chromosome accounts for superior male strength, stature, mass of muscle, sleight of hand, speed of foot. These attributes have been of considerable value in a world dominated by a need for physical power and energy and a raw, brutal, martial strength. We have become accustomed to thinking of 'real' men as those who labour in the iron, steel and coal industries, in shipbuilding, lumberjacking, pre-mechanised farming. Our martial heroes have been almost entirely male, in the fantasies and the realities of hand-to-hand combat, of sheer physical guts, the will to survive, athletic derring-do. What price all that brute strength, might and energy now, when more people are employed making Indian curries than mining coal, when computerised robots and not sweating men assemble cars and when the male predilection for violence, far from saving national pride, threatens world survival? </p> <p> There is hardly anything to be done in today's society that cannot be done by women. 'So what!' say women, not unreasonably, given the age it has taken to establish such a state of affairs. So what, indeed. The problem is one for men and particularly for those men - and they have been the majority - who have defined their lives, their identities, the very essence of their masculinity in terms of professional and occupational achievement and have prided themselves on the work that only they as men could do. My father's generation prided themselves on being providers - for their spouses, families and themselves. Today, providing seems no longer required. Married women increasingly reap the benefit of education, harness their intelligence and generate their own incomes. In one-parent families women press hard for workplace creches and better childcare facilities, as well as social security payments to compensate for male-generated finances. Not merely is the role of provider under siege, the role of father is threatened. The second millennium has ended with man's claim to a significant role in procreation and child-rearing seriously diminished. The rise in the number of single mothers suggests not merely that men are inadequate as partners and fathers but that they are simply redundant. Women are asserting that they can conceive and rear children on their own. They don't need men to father their children. The development of assisted reproduction, including techniques such as in vitro fertilisation, artificial insemination by anonymous donor and surrogate motherhood, together with the highly political and controversial assertion that single parenting is as good as that provided by two parents, raise the question - whither fatherhood? If conception, pregnancy, delivery and child-rearing can be perfectly well accomplished without the active participation of the male, then why bother with him at all, given the heartache, the trouble, the sheer cussedness of today's man? Once so proud of his penis (Freud, after all, argued that women envied it), contemporary man now finds he is being reduced to the role of support seed carrier, as women occupy centre stage not merely in the creation of new life (they have always been there) but in its nurturing. It is hardly surprising that there are some men who seriously suggest that the only way they can again play a reproductive and parental role of any significance is if they can be assisted by science to have babies themselves! </p> <p> A century ago, a peevish Sigmund Freud, perplexed by a seeming epidemic of hysterical, depressed, lethargic and dissatisfied women, asked, 'What do women want?' He asked it at a time when to be a woman was to be pathological, to be male was to be health personified. A century later it is not women who are seen to be pathological, but men; it is not women's wants, but men's, that mystify us. But before we can begin to answer what men want, deserve or need, it is necessary to reassess what we know about men. What is it that the Y chromosome, the cause of all the trouble, is up to? Are men innately and incorrigibly violent? Must the issue between the sexes be for men a case of dominate or be dominated, for women a choice between being resistant or submissive? In a world of equal opportunity for the sexes, can men renegotiate the relationship with themselves and with women? Is there anything left of the male role as provider and protector? Do we need men? Do we need fathers? And if we do, what kind of men, what kind of fathers do we need? </p> <p> The contemporary world is still, for the most part, divided into two spheres - the private sphere, inhabited for the most part by women, and a public sphere where men find and cultivate their identity and assert their dominance. The power of patriarchy, that set of relations of power that enable men to control women, is grounded in the belief that the public takes precedence over the private. Women struggling to escape the constraints of patriarchy are drawn into a tacit acceptance of the superior value of the public, the business, the profession and the office, and a devaluation of the private. Men, as a consequence, feel little need to reassess the priority they give to the public; indeed, the very desire of women to establish their own public legitimacy is interpreted as further proof that the public is indeed superior and the private is legitimately regarded as inferior. </p> <p> In exploring the challenged state of masculinity in this book, I have chosen the term 'phallus' very deliberately. The penis is an anatomical term referring to the male generative organ. The phallus is an anthropological and theological term referring to its image. The penis is an organ with biological functions, the phallus is an idea venerated in various religions as a symbol of male power. Phallic refers not merely to the penis but incorporates notions of potency, virility, manliness, strength and power. It has been seen as the 'signifier of signifiers', the mark which positions the individual as male and locates him in terms of authority, control, dominance'. The phallus 'signifies what men think they have and what women are believed to lack'. Man's penis is not at issue, except for its possible redundancy as a tool of procreation. But phallic man, authoritative, dominant, assertive - man in control not merely of himself but of woman - is starting to die, and now the question is whether a new man will emerge phoenix-like in his place or whether man himself will become largely redundant.</p>",
  "Let me say first of all: it is because since 1997 we have put our Labour values and our priorities into action that Britain has greater economic stability, rising investment in health, education and our public services, a national minimum wage for the first time, and the lowest unemployment for a generation. <p> And here in Brighton today, again speaking the language of priorities, I want to discuss with this conference and, from this conference, to discuss with the British people the economic challenges our country still faces. The difficulties we must still surmount, the new world pressures we now have to tackle and the long term choices we as a country have to make on the future of our economy, the future of public spending, the future of pensions and the future of taxes</p> <p> Choices that we must make by heeding the call of principle and hearing the voices of the people as we listen and, as is our ambition and duty, to put ourselves at the service of the hard working people of Britain.</p> <p> And I want the message to go out from Brighton this afternoon that if we, the Labour party, make the case for our values; and if by our service we show the British people we are worthy of trust then we can aim higher, and in our time and generation build a Britain of full employment. One where there is educational opportunity for all. A Britain where we abolish child and pensioner poverty, create a safe environment for all our children and show that the best health service for each of us is a national health service run for all of us.</p> <p> A Britain where, true to our values, not just a few people but everyone has the chance to fulfil their potential and share in national prosperity.</p> <p> In 1997 we said that the future depended upon first building strong and long term foundations for economic stability.</p> <p> We all remember the early 90s.</p> <p> It was Britain's hard working families -the one million who lost jobs in manufacturing, the one million businesses that went under, the million homeowners with negative equity. It was hard working families who paid the price and bore the brunt of economic failure. And by 1997 with the deficit nearly 30 billion, the national debt doubled, debt payments bigger than the schools budget, inflation rising, and the economy on the way back to the old familiar cycle of boom and bust, we resolved to, and under Tony Blair had the strength to, take difficult long term decisions</p> <p> Bank of England independence. Tough controls on public spending. The difficult decision to raise fuel taxes. The decision to pay back debt and cut the costs of debt.</p> <p> Breaking from the chronic and flawed Conservative short-termism and implementing Labour values; planning for the long-term; economic responsibility; building from strong foundations. Determined to protect hard working families from a return to boom and bust.</p> <p> So it is not by accident, but by our actions, that we now have the lowest inflation for over 30 years and around the lowest long term interest rates for 35 years, and a mortgage bill on average \u00a31,000 lower than under Tory interest rates.</p> <p> And it is not by default but by design that unemployment among men is the lowest since 1980, unemployment among women the lowest since 1976, long term unemployment now the lowest since the 1970s, youth unemployment now the lowest since 1975. For the first time in years, unemployment among single parents and the disabled is now falling, as we make the right to work a reality. And I am determined that no one is excluded.</p> <p> And because we have cut the costs of unemployment and debt, it is not by coincidence, but by choice that we are now tackling the long-term neglect of under investment in Britain and spending on health is rising by 7 per cent, education this year by 10 per cent and public investment in Britain is rising this year by 30 per cent, years of Tory underinvestment now replaced by a Labour plan for sustained long term investment.</p> <p> These things did not just happen. The priorities and tough decisions of a Labour government made them happen.</p> <p> And it is precisely because we have taken the time and trouble to build the long term foundation for success, precisely because we have resisted short term lurches in policy, that we can today steer a course of stability at a time of uncertainty in the world economy without putting growth at risk.</p> <p> So we will not return to the old short-termism.</p> <p> There will be no sudden lurches in tax or spending policy.</p> <p> And there will be no irresponsible pre-election sprees or pay demands that put youth jobs or any jobs at risk. No change in our policy on Europe, support in principle for the single currency, in practise the five tests that have to be met. And no relaxing our fiscal rules.</p> <p> We will not put hard won economic stability at risk. No return to short-termism. No return to Tory boom and bust.</p> <p> Now, the Tories used to say a Labour government meant recession and unemployment but now Mr Portillo is pushing a new argument: to accept there is economic stability and growth but then to say this is nothing to do with the government. </p> <p> I ask Mr Portillo and these Tories: if economic stability was so simple to achieve, why did the Tory party give Britain twenty years of stop-go, twenty years of boom and bust? It is Labour that is now the party for stability and growth.</p> <p> If falling unemployment was so simple to achieve, why did their policies give us three million unemployed and why was it never below today's level on any single day in two decades of Conservative government?</p> <p> And if prudence in public finances is so simple, why did the Tories land us with a 50 billion deficit, the worst in our history and double the nation debt?</p> <p> These things didn't just happen. The flawed values of a Tory government made them happen.</p> <p> And amidst their mismanagement when all these mistakes were being made is it nor right that we ask where was Mr Portillo?</p> <p> When it came to imposing VAT on fuel, is it not right that all of us ask, where was Portillo?</p> <p> I'll tell you. At the treasury, imposing VAT on fuel.</p> <p> When it came to imposing twenty-two Tory tax rises, is it not right that we all ask, where was Mr Portillo?</p> <p> At the treasury, imposing twenty-two Tory tax rises.</p> <p> When it came to imposing the poll tax, is it not right that we all ask where was Mr Portillo?</p> <p> I'll tell you. A local government minister imposing the poll tax.</p> <p> When it came to the biggest ever cuts in public spending and public services, it is right that we ask where was Mr Portillo?</p> <p> At the treasury imposing cuts in public services.</p> <p> But our duty to the people of Britain is greater than avoiding Tory boom and bust, or even achieving stability for a year or two.</p> <p> So we will stick with our long-term task - to build for the first time in a generation in Britain a culture that, by entrenching low inflation and long term stability, builds prosperity for homeowners, small businesses and all those in work and in need of work.</p> <p> It is because we understand the difficulties that the weak Euro and strong pound has caused for manufacturers and exporters that we have introduced new tax incentives for manufacturers and exporters, and in every pre-budget report we look carefully at the needs of manufacturers and business.</p> <p> And I say to all who want to avoid a return to economic instability, even when events like rising oil prices and unstable exchange rates challenge us, we will do everything we can with our international partners to promote stability.</p> <p> A 300 per cent rise in oil price in 18 months cannot be justified and I understand the difficulties it is causing for motorists, business and consumers in Britain as it is in every continent of the world.</p> <p> That is why when I was in Prague, we fought for and secured an agreement from all countries, oil producers and oil consumers, that oil production had to increase and that oil prices had to come down.</p> <p> And I will report further on this and other issues in my pre-budget report and in the budget.</p> <p> And just as we have had the strength to make hard long term choices based on Labour values to build stability and growth, so too we have put in place a long term employment policy based on difficult choices, not just about the right to work but the responsibility to work. And we made the hard decisions the Tories would never make - to charge a windfall tax on the utilities, so that some of the richest companies helped the poorest communities.</p> <p> All my life I have seen in the town I grew up in, and in the constituency I serve, unemployment scar the lives of far too many people.</p> <p> In these years the unemployed people I met did not lack talent, did not lack initiative, did not lack the will to work, they lacked a government on their side.</p> <p> That is why in the first days in government David Blunkett, Andrew Smith and I went out and talked to young unemployed men and women about a new deal. I knew then our challenge was to prove to these young people they finally had a government on their side. A government that worked for them.</p> <p> With us today is Lee Ford, aged 23, from Barnsley.</p> <p> Unemployed under the Tories, now in work under Labour.</p> <p> And not just a job, but now with his fianc\u00e9 buying their first home.</p> <p> And we pledge that on behalf of Lee Ford and thousands like him,- what we have built up in the new deal we will never let the Tories destroy.</p> <p> Remember our pledge card, our posters about jobs for young people moving from welfare to work.</p> <p> I can report to this conference that we will next year be able to put on every billboard on the country: 250,000 young people who have moved from welfare to work.</p> <p> And I am now determined that we build not one million jobs but build full employment for our generation.</p> <p> Unemployment in Scotland, Wales, the north and midlands is the lowest for more than twenty years.</p> <p> But we will not rest our efforts as long as there are people and places excluded. With \u00a3500 million for the regional development agencies in every area of Britain, our aim is full employment not just in one region but in every region of the country.</p> <p> But if we are to achieve and sustain full employment, we must together - industry, unions, government, public services - address new world pressures and overcome the old British problems of short-termism and under investment, low productivity, inadequate skills and restrictive practises, wherever they are.</p> <p> Already, to promote enterprise, \u00a31 billion for science. A 10p rate of capital gains tax, a 10p small business tax rate. Employee shares for all, 180 billion for transport.</p> <p> And enterprise open to all. For high unemployment inner cities and regions our pre-budget report will propose new tax cuts allied to spending increases to replace deprivation by enterprise, poverty by employment, neglect by new business.</p> <p> Labour: the party of enterprise.</p> <p> And all the time demonstrating that enterprise is not at the cost of fairness but that enterprise and fairness go together.</p> <p> And because the Tories did not understand that efficiency and justice are not enemies but vital allies in the battle to raise productivity, they wrongly denied workers rights, women's rights, equal rights - and they said a minimum wage would cost a million jobs.</p> <p> Yes, a minimum wage, and yes, a million jobs.</p> <p> Let us tell them - in 3 years with the minimum wage in place we have not destroyed a million jobs, Britain has created one million jobs.</p> <p> And the only jobs the minimum wage cost were those of the Tory MPs who opposed it.</p> <p> And let us pledge here at this conference to work to make sure that these are jobs that are not coming back.</p> <p> And because the evidence now demonstrates that economic efficiency and social justice are not at odds but go hand in hand, I can tell this conference today of a further priority for next year: Steven Byres has asked the low pay commission to report next year on a further rise in the minimum wage as we secure fairness at work.</p> <p> And I give you this pledge as we celebrate 30 years of equal pay legislation, it is now the right time to ensure that in future no woman will have - as in the past -to wait years for their right to equal pay to be realised.</p> <p> And because family friendly employment is good for both employers and employees, there will be new measures for maternity pay and leave, and with new investment, our commitment to high quality accessible and affordable child care, a national childcare strategy for Britain.</p> <p> And never again do we want mothers and fathers refused time off to see their sick children, so the right to time off when a family member is ill. That is what a good family policy is all about.</p> <p> And one of the best family policies of all - the working families tax credit.</p> <p> With us today, Fozia Afzal from Preston, mother of three children. On poverty pay under the Tories. Now, as result of the working families tax credit, \u00a325 a week better off this year alone.</p> <p> The Tories would abolish the working families tax credit. I tell you today we will expand it.</p> <p> Let us pledge for Fozia and one million others we will never let the Tories abolish the credit and push her and one million others back into poverty.</p> <p> In the 1980s and 1990s, thousands of men and women over 50 were thrown on the employment scrapheap. Age discrimination is wrong. Today half a million people over 50 are back in work. And I give you this pledge - we will do all we can to end age discrimination in employment and help older workers back to jobs.</p> <p> Now when we came into power we decided that the right thing to do was to put the poorest pensioners first.</p> <p> And in this parliament we are spending \u00a36 billion more. More than the earnings link, most to those who need it most, most to help lift the poorest pensioners out of poverty</p> <p> It was not wrong to put the abolition of pensioner poverty first.</p> <p> But I know that we have more to do, much more to do.</p> <p> We have to do more not just for the poorest but for millions more, all those pensioners who have yet to share enough in the rising prosperity of the country.</p> <p> We will build upon the basic state pension: the basic state pension is now, and will remain, the foundation of everything we do.</p> <p> We will fight against the Tories' plan to opt out, to break up, to destroy the basic pension.</p> <p> And let me tell this conference today that in the pre-budget report, it will be a priority that we do more, with by 2003 a new pension credit that will get extra help not only to the poorest, but to the millions who have lost out in the rising prosperity of the country.</p> <p> And in the meantime as the statement to this conference which Alistair Darling and I put to the economic policy commission last week, says there will be transitional arrangements to the benefit of all pensioners. And we will publish a detailed plan in the next few weeks.</p> <p> Let me explain the new pension credit. Just as the working families tax credit is getting extra money directly to lower and middle income families, so too our new pension credit will reward saving and get cash directly to millions of lower and middle income pensioners.</p> <p> Each year, more cash than either an inflation rise or an earnings link would provide.</p> <p> More money for retired men and women with small works pensions, more money for widows with modest savings, more for men and women who have worked hard and saved all their lives, but who struggle to get by, and whose cause is our cause.</p> <p> Everybody knows that we are having to tackle extremes of pensioner poverty and also rising pensioner inequality that has demanded new thinking:</p> <p> Today in the year 2000, one in 6 pensioner couples retire on more than 4oo a week</p> <p> Soon that figure will become one in five, and in time, one in four and then one in three.</p> <p> It is a progressive principle that we should do more for those who have the greatest needs.</p> <p> So if we are to plan for the future, our priority cannot be that the wealthiest get exactly the same as the neediest.</p> <p> A flat rate increase will not do enough to help pensioners on modest incomes and do nothing to diminish growing inequalities but instead reinforce them.</p> <p> We will build upon the basic state pension.</p> <p> For the poorest pensioners, we are drawing up plans to raise the minimum income guarantee to \u00a390 a week.</p> <p> And our pension credit will ensure that we reward and do not penalise saving and will ensure that all lower and middle income pensioners will receive extra help, get more than the earnings link, year by year.</p> <p> We will spend more and we will spend more fairly.</p> <p> And I want it to be said of us:</p> <p> This was the generation that had the determination and commitment to abolish pensioner poverty in our country. But not only that, by all our measures taken together, we ensured every pensioner shared in the rising prosperity of the nation.</p> <p> I say to this conference, I want a Britain where what matters is not the privilege you were born to, but the potential you are born with, I want a Britain where what matters is not the school you went to but the skills you are prepared to acquire.</p> <p> It is a Britain where what is valued is not the connections you inherit but the contribution you are prepared to make.</p> <p> What drives us forward, what inspires us to action is not the Britain we are but the Britain we can become, the causes yet unworn, the potential yet unrealised, the vision yet unfulfilled, the future yet to be born.</p> <p> And because these values challenge us to higher efforts, I tell this conference that in the months ahead, the months up to the coming election we will work every day every week to convince the British people that we deserve a new mandate for a purpose: with already 1.2 million children lifted out of poverty, we can aim higher, we will seek a simple and fundamental mandate to eradicate child poverty in our generation. And give every child best possible start in life.</p> <p> So there is a Tory way - tolerating child poverty - and there is a Labour way - ending it.</p> <p> Already there are hundreds of thousands more students in higher and further education, but we can aim higher. We will seek a mandate to enable a majority of young people to go to college or university. And educational opportunity truly for all.</p> <p> So there is a Tory way - education for an elite, and there is a Labour way - lifelong education for all.</p> <p> With the health service now allocated more resources year on year than ever before, we can aim higher for an NHS true to its central founding ideal - that the best NHS for each of us is the health service free at the point of need for all of us in every part of Britain.</p> <p> So there is a Tory way - the road to privatisation and cuts and there is a Labour way - investing in a national service run in the public sectors by the best public servants as a public service, and Labour internationalism, not Tory isolationism is our goal.</p> <p> That is why yesterday in Prague led by Clare Short and by this party we pressed for and agreed a new plan to wipe out the debts of the 20 poorest countries by December this year. And unlock millions of the world's poor from the chains of unpayable debts. But as long as there is poverty suffering and injustice we must never relax our efforts our cause endures - a virtuous circle of debt relief, poverty reduction and economic development that helps all the worlds poor.</p> <p> The abolition of child poverty.</p> <p> An end to pensioner poverty.</p> <p> Full employment.</p> <p> Educational opportunity truly for all.</p> <p> The best health service for each of us.</p> <p> Great causes worthy of our party's ideals.</p> <p> Great causes today shared, I believe, by the British people.</p> <p> An essential foundation for our country's future.</p> <p> Causes that now challenge indeed call us as a party and as a country to action.</p> <p> Causes for which we will work every day to earn a new mandate from the people of Britain.</p> <p> But let no one be in any doubt - to achieve these goals requires the country to make a choice.</p> <p> It is a choice facing us, which goes beyond decisions on any individual tax or spending programme</p> <p> The choice is this.</p> <p> Is our national priority today to build long term stability and invest in hospitals, schools and strong public services for all?</p> <p> Or is it to put both stability and public services at risk by irresponsible tax promises, which if implemented will cut billions from hospitals, schools and our core services?</p> <p> And there should be a great national debate about this choice.</p> <p> When I became shadow chancellor I said to you then, as I say to you now, that we will never tax just for taxation's sake, that spending decisions will never again be made in isolation from how we pay for them, that all spending and tax decisions must have a sound justification in principle, and that we are prepared to make difficult decisions so that Britain can enjoy stability in our public finances and invest in our public services - the hospitals, schools, public transport and the policing the country needs.</p> <p> But it is because this country needs full employment that with the 10p rate, with cuts in employers and employees national insurance, and with the new working families tax credit, we have targeted tax cuts to encourage and reward work.</p> <p> It is because we want to promote investment and savings and encourage and reward entrepreneurs that we have introduced a new 10p small business tax rate, a new tax cut for innovation research and development and cut capital gains tax for long term investment to as low as 10p.</p> <p> It is because we want a tax system that is fair to working families and tackles poverty that we are introducing a new system of family support, which while giving \u00a315 to every child will give \u00a350 a week for the poorest child.</p> <p> It is because we want to safeguard the environment that we have cut pollution through the climate change levy and cut car tax on the 4m least polluting cars and targeted tax incentives on ultra low sulphur diesel.</p> <p> It is right that we target tax cuts on the countries priorities. And in future budgets we will have targeted tax cuts again.</p> <p> But what we rule out is blanket irresponsible tax promises that cut into the \u00a34 billion extra investment in transport, the \u00a312bn in education and training, the \u00a314bn in health, we will not put the long term future of our public services at risk.</p> <p> For however difficult the decisions we have to make, the country will never forgive us if we lurch from one opportunist tax decision to another and retreat to the old short termist ways of the past</p> <p> We will do nothing that puts this country's stability and public services at risk.</p> <p> So I tell you the country does face a choice. And there should now be a great national debate. </p> <p> Not a debate simply conducted in Westminster or Whitehall; this is a debate, the outcome of which will affect every part of this country, and so it must take place in every part of this country.</p> <p> As we debate this choice - and in the annual pre budget consultation - we will listen and we will also make our case.</p> <p> With the farmers and hauliers - and also with the nurses and health service workers, the teachers and public servants, people working in manufacturing service and exporting sectors, and all those who depend upon our public services...all the hard working families of Britain.</p> <p> This national debate is too important to ever be decided by those who shout the loudest or push the hardest. The British way, the Labour way is that every voice must be heard.</p> <p> Friends, they said in one term we could never simultaneously create stability, one million jobs, abolish 800 hereditary peers, create devolution for Scotland and Wales create a minimum wage for Britain and take a million children out of poverty.</p> <p> But we have.</p> <p> Now they will say we cannot achieve our priorities.</p> <p> Full employment. Abolish child and pensioner poverty. Build world class public services. Prosperity for all.</p> <p> I say we can and we will</p>",

  "A buoyed-up deputy prime minister enjoyed a standing ovation today as he kicked off Labour's annual conference proper, insisting Labour \"does listen and does act\". <p>John Prescott rounded on recent critics who had claimed the government was aloof and had not listened, particularly over the petrol crisis.</p> <p>As expected, he again stressed the government's determination not to give in to the protesters, who had called for a drop in fuel duty within three months. \"Yes we do listen and yes we do act,\" he told delegates. \"But I want to make it absolutely clear - no government, no prime minister, no chancellor can simply chop and change taxes by the month or renegotiate them at the refinery gate at the threat of 60 days' notice.\"</p> <p>There were the usual sideswipes: at Tory snobbery (\"no wonder they are so interested in the countryside - they own half of it\"); at Conservative environmental policies (\"under the Tories we were known as the dirty man of Europe\"); and at the pro-hunting lobby (\"every time I see the Countryside Alliance and their contorted faces, I vow to redouble my efforts to abolish foxhunting\"). </p> <p>But Mr Prescott also threw in the surprise announcement that all pensioners would be entitled to a free bus-pass, scrapping some local authorities' practice of charging up to \u00a340 per pass. He said the scheme would, for the first time, be extended to the disabled too. \"That's social justice,\" he said.</p> <p>Mr Prescott used much of his speech in the Brighton conference arena to list Labour's achievements in the environment, transport and the regions, for which he has responsibility. He said the party's supporters should be proud of what had been achieved because it was \"delivery, delivery, delivery\". </p> <p>He said that at the Kyoto summit Britain had led the way on curbing pollution levels. The government's 10-year plan for transport represented the biggest long-term investment in road and rail that the country had ever seen, Mr Prescott said. And water and air quality had drastically improved, local government was now enjoying greater powers and the country's town, cities and villages were now better places to live.</p> <p>He ridiculed Margaret Thatcher's statements that there was \"no such thing as society\" and that the key point about the Good Samaritan was that he had money in his pocket. \"We believe there's such a thing as society and we do not walk on the other side of the road.\"</p> <p>In typical combative spirit, he accused Tories of wanting to drive a wedge between town and country. \"We want a living, working countryside,\" he said. </p> <p>Turning to Labour's hopes in the coming election fray, he said the party's policy commission had put forward an exciting programme of work. \"Now we need to get out campaigning to win that second term, to put those ideas into practice.\" </p> <p>With the prime minister sitting alongside, Mr Prescott praised both Mr Blair and the chancellor, Gordon Brown, for providing the circumstances for a major improvement in public services. \"Too often in the past, politicians have dodged long-term responsibility for the sake of short-term expediency. </p> <p>\"I've always been a bit of a conviction politician,\" he said. \"I will always do what I believe is right. Sometimes I get attacked for it. So be it - because when I decide policies I decide them not for tomorrow's headlines but for tomorrow's children.\"</p> <p>On public transport, he said he had \"wasted no time\" in calling for the \"long overdue\" public inquiry into the Thames Marchioness disaster. And following the Paddington and Southall rail tragedies, he insisted that the best train safety system would be installed, despite claims the government was planning to \"do it on the cheap\".</p>",

  "This is an important week for all of us. The media are saying we are downbeat. Well I\u0092m not downbeat. The Party\u0092s not downbeat, and neither is the Labour government. <p> And why? Because we\u0092re proud of what this Labour overnment has achieved. It has been delivery, delivery, delivery. </p> <p> On May 1st 1997, we won the election on a radical programme for the environment, transport and local government. As the first step, Tony Blair created a new government department, whose very purpose is a better quality of life for the people of this country. And I\u0092ve got an excellent team of ministers who are putting it into action. </p> <p> Conference, all our policies will count for little if they are not delivered centrally, regionally and locally. That is why it\u0092s so important to bring decision-making closer to the people it affects. We have brought devolution to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. And a strategic authority back to London. And we\u0092ve taken steps towards the sort of regional government I have always believed in. All English regions are enjoying greater prosperity. The new Regional Development Agencies have already saved 35,000 jobs. </p> <p> But the Tories want to abolish them. So let\u0092s ask them why they think development agencies are good for Scotland and Wales, but not for the English regions? </p> <p> And let me say this, I\u0092m proud of the work our 10,000 Labour councillors do for their local communities, up and down the country. I want to see the potential of local government liberated. </p> <p> We abolished compulsory competitive tendering. </p> <p> We ended the Tory \u0091capping\u0092 regime. </p> <p> We offered new modern choices in the way councils work, including a directly elected Mayor if local people want it. </p> <p> Of course there are still problems. But local councils are now better funded than ever before. They have new freedoms. And they have more responsibility too. </p> <p> Local government is our partner - no longer 'the enemy within'. </p> <p> That's Labour democracy in action. </p> <p> We\u0092ve given local councils new powers to promote the economic, social and environmental well-being of their communities. The environment is central to our quality of life. Under the Tories, Britain became known as 'the dirty man of Europe\u0092. We\u0092ve changed all that. </p> <p> I\u0092m proud of what this government has done for the environment, at home and abroad - cleaning up the air we breathe, the water we drink, our seas, our rivers and beaches \u0096 all far better under Labour. Cutting water leaks by a quarter-saving enough to supply London for a year. Protecting our wildlife and the beauty of Britain\u0092s countryside. </p> <p> But the environment doesn\u0092t just begin at the edge of town. It starts when you step out of the door. </p> <p> That\u0092s why we are improving people's homes, neighbourhoods, public services, how we travel, and how we live. Not just as individuals, but as part of a community. </p> <p> As our Constitution says: We believe that \"by the strength of our common endeavour we achieve more than we achieve alone\". We believe there is such a thing as society. We believe we do have responsibilities to others. That\u0092s why we\u0092ve set up a \u00a31 billion programme to help pensioners keep their homes warm, including brand new central heating. </p> <p> And we\u0092ve done more. </p> <p> We\u0092ve set a new goal to wipe out fuel poverty by the year 2010, because we in the Labour Party do not believe elderly people should die, just because they can\u0092t afford to keep warm. That's Labour social justice in action. And nowadays we have world responsibilities in a global environment, where pollution respects no national boundaries. </p> <p> The greatest environmental threat facing the world today is climate change. Britain led the way at the historic summit in Kyoto. In November I\u0092ll be going to the next round of talks in the Hague. The scientific evidence is clear. If we don\u0092t cut greenhouse gases, then climate change will cause havoc across the world. </p> <p> In Britain, floods in winter, drought in summer, low-lying areas swamped by the sea. And tropical diseases will spread - right here in Britain. In Britain. But in Bangladesh, millions of people face devastation from floods. Africa will be stricken by drought and famine. Small islands submerged forever. Ice caps melting. Already in America we see violent storms and the return of the dust bowls. </p> <p> All this and more will plague our world environment, unless industrialised countries stop poisoning the atmosphere. There\u0092s too much talk about the pain, not the gain, when it comes to our environment. Wasting less energy makes industry more competitive. Properly insulated homes are easier to warm. And cleaner cars cut our fuel bills. </p> <p> I know people want cheaper petrol. We hear them loud and clear. But we also hear people when they say they want cleaner air, a better environment. We hear people say they want money spent on schools and hospitals, not to mention farm subsidies, and relief for road haulage. </p> <p> Yes, of course there are real problems. Yes, of course we will listen. Yes, of course we do act. But we will deal with those problems through proper democratic representations in the budget process. </p> <p> And one thing is clear. </p> <p> No government, no prime minister, no chancellor can simply chop and change taxes by the month, Or renegotiate them at a refinery gate, under threat of 60 days notice. That is no way to make decisions in a democratic country. </p> <p> Some of the press might think so. But they sang a different tune when it came to the French blockades, and one or two legal industrial disputes I could mention. So you have to find the right balance in government (and as a nation) which is never easy. But who said politics was easy? </p> <p> I knew when I took this job, that it would take time to transform our transport, after decades of stop-go funding. </p> <p> As a former seafarer, I\u0092m proud that - while the Tories devastated our merchant fleet \u0096 now, under Labour, ships are coming back to the British Red Ensign flag - over a million tonnes so far. </p> <p> Across transport, we\u0092re providing new resources, new powers, new means of delivery \u0096 perhaps most crucially the Strategic Rail Authority, which will ensure private rail firms act in the public interest. </p> <p> </p> <p> The Policy Commission document is full of good ideas on transport and the whole range of issues, on which I\u0092m sure we\u0092ll all agree. And let me congratulate all those involved in the difficult and detailed work, which will give us a new framework for future policy. </p> <p> But let me deal with a point of disagreement on train protection. </p> <p> Let's be clear about this. On the road, on rail, in the air and at sea, safety always comes first in my priorities. One of the main reasons I came into politics was to make shipping safer. Earlier this year I set out a strategy to reduce deaths on the roads by 40%, and by 50% for children. </p> <p> And remember how the Tories ignored \u0096 for 8 years \u0096 pleas for a public inquiry after the sinking of the Thames boat the Marchioness, where 51 people died, causing so much suffering for their families? We restored some form of justice to those grieving families, and not before time. </p> <p> I wasted no time in calling public inquiries after the Southall and Paddington tragedies. After talking to the relatives and walking amongst the wreckage, I was determined they must mark a watershed in rail safety. </p> <p> That\u0092s why I appointed Lord Cullen \u0096 the man who transformed safety in the North Sea \u0096 to head a public inquiry covering the whole safety regime on the railways. We have taken over 30 separate measures to improve rail safety since coming to office, ranging from better driver training to safer rail carriages. </p> <p> Already the number of trains passing red signals has been cut by a quarter in one year. </p> <p> We took advice from Britain's most respected engineer, Sir David Davies. His recommendation was clear. He said install Automatic Train Protection on faster lines, and we\u0092re doing it. But install the Train Protection Warning System across the whole network first, and we\u0092re doing that too. </p> <p> Why? Because this can save more lives than alternative systems which would take ten years to install. That is the sort of difficult decision we face - save lives now or wait for better technology in ten years. </p> <p> Nevertheless I have asked Lord Cullen, together with the chairman of the Southall inquiry, to make specific recommendations on this very question. His public inquiry on this point started last week. But everyone \u0096 relatives, trade unions, lawyers and safety experts - has urged me not to do anything that would pre-empt Lord Cullen\u0092s inquiry. I agree. </p> <p> And I recommend to conference that you do the same and reject the alternative wording that would pre-empt Lord Cullen \u0096 as the National Policy Forum agreed at Exeter in July. </p> <p> Conference must understand that I have given my word that I stand ready to implement whatever is required as a result of Lord Cullen\u0092s proposals, and I will stand by that. </p> <p> </p> <p> But for most people, it\u0092s the daily business of travelling by road and rail that dominates. Our ten-year plan represents the biggest long-term investment in transport this country has ever seen. 180 billion pounds over ten years. In the next three years alone, public investment on transport will rise from \u00a35 billion to a record \u00a39 billion a year. </p> <p> But this is a joint effort between the public and private sectors. In public and private partnership. So, in railways, we\u0092ll see more invested in the next ten years than we saw in the last one hundred years. New track. New trains. New signalling. New services. New stations. </p> <p> More priority for buses in towns and more bus links in rural areas. More \u0091supertrams\u0092 and safer walking and cycling. </p> <p> On our roads, we will tackle the major bottlenecks. We can get more capacity out of the existing road network, but we recognise you can\u0092t simply build your way of congestion. </p> <p> It\u0092s all about balance. Through this and better public transport, we will actually reduce congestion below current levels. And the ten-year plan is not just about figures. It will roll out into real improvements in the years to come. Here are a few examples. </p> <p> This year, the SRA has negotiated the first new rail franchises with more guaranteed investment and better services. By 2001, we\u0092ll start 12 major road improvements. By 2002 half the country\u0092s rail fleet will be new or refurbished, the first phase of the West Coast Mainline will reduce journey times between London and Manchester or Preston to under two hours and the first phase of the channel tunnel rail link will be built and the second phase to St Pancras will begin. </p> <p> In 2003 we will finish 100 safety and congestion improvements to our trunk roads and complete the Nottingham Express transit. In 2004 two hundred more motorway cameras to help traffic flow and reduce congestion. In 2006 all three new Manchester Metrolink lines will be completed. In 2007 widening on motorway bottlenecks will begin. By 2008 we\u0092ve agreed with manufacturers that new cars will do 25% more miles to the gallon. By 2009 the East Coast mainline railway will be upgraded. In 2010 we will see 50% more passengers on trains and 80% more on rail freight. </p> <p> And the benefits will affect every corner of the country. </p> <p> That\u0092s integration in action. Not only better transport links, but integrated thinking that will make life better in our towns and cities. </p> <p> Many of you know from bitter experience, the Tories ripped the heart out of our cities. As the Rogers report, that I commissioned makes clear, this calls for nothing less than an 'urban renaissance'. As he said: \u0091 Cities make citizens and citizens make cities\u0092. How true. That means not just better housing, planning and design, but better jobs, transport, schools, policing and health. Because the quality of life is not contradictory to economic growth; it\u0092s critical to economic growth. If the local school is failing, or the streets are dirty and dangerous, people start to move away. Businesses and investment follow, leaving behind a cycle of poverty and rising crime. </p> <p> We need to think creatively. </p> <p> For example, our universities should not be ivory towers. They should be a resource for their communities, helping to bring skills, jobs and growth. We need social investment. We have released over \u00a35bn of capital receipts to renovate 2 million homes. We need imagination. We are preparing a new Starter Home Scheme to help key workers like nurses and teachers set up home in high cost areas. </p> <p> And for our coalfield communities, destroyed by the prejudice of theThatcher regime, we produced a \u00a3350m package, bringing jobs and hope where the Tories brought the dole and despair. </p> <p> That\u0092s a matter of honour, that we have delivered. </p> <p> And remember this, the greater the exodus from the towns, the greater the strain on the countryside. The Tories want to drive a wedge between the town and the country. We want a living, working countryside. </p> <p> I see the Countryside Alliance are outside to celebrate our hundredth birthday. They are very kind - they came to celebrate my 30th year as an MP for Hull. But I ask the protesters outside the Hall, when the Tories were shutting 2,000 post offices, selling off 10,000 council houses, ending bus services and closing village schools \u0096 why weren't you outside Tory Party conferences protesting for those 18 years? </p> <p> But I tell you this, every time I see the Countryside Alliance I redouble my determination to vote in the House of Commons to abolish fox hunting forever. </p> <p> And I reject claims that people who oppose fox hunting are out of sympathy with rural Britain. From the day my school took me as a boy to the Lake District, I have always loved the countryside. It was Labour, just over 50 years ago, that gave Britain its first national parks. Last year, I announced two new national parks in the South Downs and the New Forest - a great gift to the British people \u0096 especially on our 100th birthday. And we I\u0092ve introduced legislation to extend the right to roam in open countryside. </p> <p> Some of the Tories in the House of Lords don't like it. They think they know all about the open countryside. After all, they own most of it. </p> <p> But I say to members of the House of Lords, this is Government policy and we fully intend to implement it. </p> <p> We believe our natural heritage is not just for the privileged few, but for the whole of our people to respect and enjoy. That's Labour freedom in action. </p> <p> Now Conference, earlier I talked about transport safety. But a life lost in a factory accident is just as important as a life lost in a traffic accident. Labour\u0092s Health and Safety at Work Act has helped reduce accidents dramatically since the 1970s. But in some industries, like construction, lives are being lost through sheer bad working practices, and a degree of indifference. </p> <p> And I\u0092ve warned the construction industry this is totally unacceptable. </p> <p> So we are shaking up health and safety. Company directors must take responsibility for safety. Penalties will be tougher. And we\u0092ve begun consultation on the offence of corporate killing. </p> <p> Company directors whose negligence costs lives must not be allowed to hide behind workers and get away 'scot free'. So, once Lord Cullen has reported on rail, we\u0092ll take decisive action to strengthen our safety law, in transport and in the workplace. </p> <p> For the first time in 25 years, we will bring forward a new wide-ranging Act of Parliament to make Britain a safer place to travel and a safer place to work in. That's Labour caring for our people. </p> <p> So Conference, we have already begun our task: to clean up Britain. To bring new life to our cities and countryside. And to give Britain a transport system we can once again be proud of. </p> <p> We have laid the foundations. But there is still a lot to do. </p> <p> Our Policy Commission has proposed an exciting programme of work. </p> <p> Now we need to get out campaigning to win that second term, to put those ideas into practice. And if you want a good example of integrated thinking - here\u0092s one: </p> <p> From next April, we\u0092ll introduce half price concessionary bus fares for all pensioners, wherever they live, England or Wales, under Tory, Liberal or Labour councils. </p> <p> And whereas some councils charge as much as \u00a340 for the pass we will insist the pass is provided free of charge. In a few weeks we\u0092ll amend our legislation to extend this scheme to disabled people as well for the first time. </p> <p> That's Labour social justice in action. That\u0092s Labour helping the environment. That's Labour backing public transport. </p> <p> But we don\u0092t get those sort of benefits without taking the hard decisions which make it possible. With Tony Blair as Prime Minister, committed to long term decisions, and Gordon Brown as Chancellor sorting out the public finances and stabilising the economy, that\u0092s how we\u0092ve been able to plan for this major improvement in public services. And I would like to record my appreciation and support for what they have achieved. </p> <p> Too often in the past, politicians have dodged long-term responsibility for the sake of short-term expediency. I\u0092ve always been a bit of a conviction politician. I will always do what I believe is right. Sometimes I get attacked for it. </p> <p> So be it. </p> <p> Because when I decide policies, I decide them not for tomorrow's headlines, but for tomorrow's children. </p> <p> And that's the way I\u0092ll always be. </p> <p> And that\u0092s how this Labour government will be. </p>",

  "<p>Global new media sales house DoubleClick has revealed details of a wide-ranging restructure for its UK office.</p> <p>Eric Stein, managing director of DoubleClick UK, said that the move was a result of the way the UK market for online advertising had matured over the past year. </p> <p>He said: \"It's a similar structure to that adopted by the US office a year ago and has come about because the market has reached a scale where we can do this. Essentially we're reacting to client demand.\"</p> <p>Growth in the number of online advertising options with new platforms and new technology also contributed to the revamp, meaning DoubleClick can offer more than just a banner or a sponsorship. </p> <p>DoubleClick is introducing Boomerang into the UK, an e-commerce marketing tool that uses cookies to encourage people back to the retail site, converting browsers into buyers. British Airways is the first UK client to sign up.</p> <p>The restructure will create four new vertical divisions, sorting sites - for which DoubleClick handles sales - by type into business, leisure, consumer and technology and auto. Each will have a separate publisher, a business development person and a sales team. A group publisher who reports to the managing director will oversee all four divisions. </p> <p>These vertical networks will work alongside a separate agency team, a sponsorship team, a marketing team and customer services. </p> <p>Mr Stein is currently recruiting two publishers for the leisure and consumer divisions and has promoted Anne-Catrin Sallaba, director of business development, to group publisher. Paul Goad, senior account manager, has been put in charge of the business network and Ben Auchettl, business development manager, has been promoted to publisher of the technology and auto network. </p> <p>The appointments will take the staff tally at DoubleClick to 34. The changes, which are expected to roll out to other European offices in the coming months, will come into effect on October 1. </p>",
  "<p>Internet entrepreneurs are increasingly realising that creating a successful e-commerce site demands more than just attractive prices, well-stocked virtual shopping malls, and reliable ordering structures. They recognise that the magic ingredient is content and that it has the much sought-after power to inspire return visits. In other words, it makes sites \"sticky\". Not only that, it makes them sell. </p> <p>One man who has long understood the selling power of content is Ken Evoy, a 46-year-old internet entrepreneur from Quebec. His company, <a href=\"http://www.SiteSell.com\">SiteSell.com</a>, is a provider of e-commerce information and software and has proved a significant internet success story. The company's first publication, Make Your Site Sell! (MYSS!), written by Evoy himself, quickly went into sales overdrive and is now acknowledged web-wide as the bible of internet marketing. </p> <p>How did Evoy manage to sell so many copies of the book? \"Words - the right ones,\" he replies. \"Of course, the words have to be backed up by great products, or you only end up with angry customers. But it's words that get sales.\" </p> <p>Many dot.coms - especially the much-hyped ones - tend to think that technical pyrotechnics will make their sites sticky and encourage sales. But Evoy dismisses this as a loser's game. \"Technology does not sell products,\" he insists. \"Nor do graphics or animated monkeys. Great products don't even sell themselves. Words sell.\" </p> <p>Because of his belief in the power of words, Evoy teamed up with veteran advertising copywriter and web-savvy author Joe Robson to write an e-book called Make Your Words Sell! (MYWS!), which was released earlier this year by SiteSell.com. Robson is a Yorkshireman who writes web copy that is generally considered to be unparalleled when it comes to selling e-products and services. Indeed, MYWS! - which offers a wealth of practical advice on how to write sales copy for the internet to your best advantage - is a testament to just how compelling and persuasive language can be. </p> <p>During the course of his work, Robson has done a lot of research into what does and doesn't work on the internet. And, like Evoy, he is in no doubt that the websites that are currently successful employ well-crafted copywriting. \"Contrary to popular opinion, there are people out there on the web quietly making extremely good money,\" he reveals. \"But their websites look more like Joe Bloggs in his bedroom. They're not flash. But because they're using good sales copy, they're churning out products like there's no tomorrow and really are making huge profits.\" </p> <p>Growing numbers of dot.coms are waking up to this fact and are consequently looking to hire \"content providers\" (otherwise known as writers) in a big way. One London-based company that has recently added an extensive selection of content to its internet site is <a href=\"http://www.Smarterwork.com\">Smarterwork.com</a> - an \"elance\" site which enables freelance workers to bid on projects posted by businesses. For Pierre Reyland, content editor at Smarterwork, the job of bringing together a team of e-writers proved relatively straightforward. He selected them from the global pool of freelancers who use the Smarterwork site. </p> <p>But he wasn't just looking for good writers - he needed writers who could write specifically for the web. \"Writing for the web is very different from writing for newspapers and magazines,\" he says. \"A monitor screen is not a very friendly interface to read from. So the writing has to be much clearer and more concise. To make a point on the web, you really have to hammer it home - using clear, simple language, highlighting important words, and splitting the text into small paragraphs, with headings and sub-headings, or using devices such as bullet-point lists, and so on.\" </p> <p>Although the skills needed for writing for the web are different from those for print media, a conventional publishing background can be helpful when embarking on an e-writing project. George Giokas, CEO of Staffwriters, a leading US writers' agency, for instance, believes that journalists make excellent web writers. \"For one thing, they are highly skilled in embracing concepts and then relating them in simple form,\" he says. \"But to be successful in writing content for a site, a journalist must also learn the tricks of direct mail, headline writing and advertising. I think a good web writer needs all of the skills from journalism, marketing, graphics and copywriting.\" </p> <p>One writer who has successfully integrated online and offline writing styles is Ann Logan, a freelance education writer from Warwickshire. She relishes the challenges of writing for the internet, but feels it requires more responsibility on the part of the writer. \"Print publications have editors and sub-editors, but the web doesn't,\" she points out. \"So there are fewer critical readers of your work. Because of that, it needs to be triple-checked before you submit it.\" </p> <p>Ability and a conscientious attitude are key attributes to look for when hiring an e-writer. But how can the average internet entrepreneur - who may have had little experience in dealing with writers - be sure that the person they are considering for a project really has what it takes to pen effective web pages? One way is to hire a web writer through Plain Words, a well-established writers' agency based in Berkshire. It tests candidates to ensure they can handle a given project. \"We describe a scenario - fictitious web entrepreneur and product/service - which is relevant to the sort of work they will be doing, and ask them how they would go about researching and writing the website,\" explains Peter Meherne, recruitment director at Plain Words. \"We'd then ask them to produce some brief copy on a particular aspect of the product or service to test their writing skills.\" </p> <p> While strong technical writing skills are essential for keeping readers glued to their VDUs, the cream of web writers take it even further and employ the novelist's technique of writing in \"character\" - in a specific voice. Joe Robson's current web project, The Newbie Club, which he co-runs with US computer wizard Tom Glander, is a case in point. </p> <p>The site is aimed at new computer users and, although Robson and Glander have done little in the way of publicity, the site is proving a runaway success. Why? \"Because we use a distinct voice in the copy,\" says Robson. \"We get into the mindset of our ideal customer. That way, we can talk to them in their language and avoid falling into the trap of talking down to them, like many websites do. The mindset of the Newbies is that of frustration at the amount of technie talk in help files. So I speak very casually, using non-technical words like 'computerish' and 'geekspeak', which they relate to.\" </p> <p>Such a strategy certainly seems to be paying off in terms of sales and the number of visitors to the site. \"It's just phenomenal,\" says Robson. \"And it goes to prove that the big dot.coms who lavish obscene amounts of money on flash websites - and still don't sell anything - must be doing something wrong. They'd save themselves a lot of money if they cut out the gadgets and gizmos and brought in some good copywriters.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Further Information: <br> Ken Evoy's SiteSell.com:<a href=\"http://www.sitesell.com\">www.sitesell.com</a> <br> Smarterwork: <a href=\"http://www.smarterwork.com\">www.smarterwork.com</a> <br> Staffwriters: <a href=\"http://www.staffwriters.com\">www.staffwriters.com</a><br> Ann Logan Writing Services: <a href=\"http://www.annlogan.com\">www.annlogan.com</a><br> Plain Words: <a href=\"http://www.plainwords.co.uk\">www.plainwords.co.uk</a> <br> The Newbie Club: <a href=\"http://www.newbieclub.com\">www.newbieclub.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Tony Blair unwittingly threatened to jeopardise the concerted global rescue mission for the euro yesterday when he suggested that there were no immediate plans for further intervention in the market this morning to support the beleaguered single currency. </p> <p>With traders braced to test the resolve of central banks when dealing opens today, the prime minister's remarks appeared to suggest that Friday's $7bn euro buying spree was a one-off and that policymakers would leave the euro to find its own level. </p> <p>Asked yesterday morning if he expected central banks to buy more euros today, the prime minister said: \"No, that's not anticipated, but whatever we do, we will do with other countries.\" </p> <p>Within minutes of the comments being flashed up on financial news wires, the Treasury was forced to mount a damage-limitation exercise. It said that Mr Blair's statement on Breakfast with Frost had been misinterpreted and that Britain's stance had not changed from the position taken by finance ministers of the Group of Seven leading industrialised economies on Saturday. </p> <p>\"The G7 remains committed to monitoring developments in foreign exchange markets and will cooperate as appropriate, the Treasury said. </p> <p>However, the prime minister's remarks were in stark contrast to the refusal of either the chancellor or the governor of the Bank of England, Sir Eddie George, to make any comment on the possibility of further attacks on currency speculators by the G7. </p> <p>The need to keep markets guessing means that central bankers and politicians rarely say anything about intervention, particularly at times when they are seeking to act in concert. In its communique on Saturday, the G7 sought to keep dealers in the dark, saying: \"In the light of recent developments, we will continue to monitor developments closely and to cooperate in exchange markets as appropriate.\" </p> <p>Sir Eddie said Saturday that he was \"technically happy\" with the way Friday's action had gone. \"The moment was well chosen and it took the market by surprise.\" Gordon Brown said that the action in the foreign exchange markets reflected concern about the level of the euro against the dollar, adding that it was not justified by the relative states of the European and US economies. </p> <p>\"It was coordinated and everybody that had been asked took part. You don't judge these things over a minute, an hour or a day. The action was a signal of our concern.\" </p> <p>Even before Mr Blair's comments, there was speculation that central banks would be taken on by the markets. All seven members of the G7 - the US, Germany, Japan, Italy, France, Canada and Britain - took part in the three separate bouts of action, which resulted in the euro rallying from just over 87 cents against the dollar to 90 cents, but it later slipped back to close at around 88 cents. </p> <p>While some analysts say the G7 action marked a watershed for the euro, veterans of the guerrilla warfare of intervention know it will take a protracted fight in order to succeed. Speculators betting on the uncertainty of Thursday's Danish referendum on euro membership next Thursday are also likely to ensure a volatile week ahead. </p> <p>\"The markets are going to test G7 resolve and the euro is in for a period of volatility. But ultimately G7 will win,\" said Kit Juckes, head of bond and currency strategy at RBS in London.</p>",
  "<p>Standing in a night club in Banja Luka in the Republic of Serbska, I'm starting to feel a wee bit nervous. We've bunked out of Nato's vast metal factory base with five pissed squaddies for a Friday night on the town, and the locals have got wise to the fact that we're Brits, mainly because the squaddies are wearing Sheffield United shirts. Three terrifying Serb boneheads are gathering nearby, getting just that bit too close for comfort. No one is talking to us. We stand out like sore thumbs. </p> <p>The promoter, clearly sensing trouble, moves over to talk to the safest face among us - Julie Dawson, who manages British DJs for UK production and management company Wise Buddah. The two of them quickly reach the international language of dance music - hard house, trance, Tong, Rampling and Cox. Then she reveals that she's over here because her company produces Boy George's radio show Clubversive, and the promoter erupts with joy. </p> <p>\"Yes, yes, Clubversive, I hear it on Oxsigen.\" And then he's clapping us on the back and getting us drinks and asking if Boy George would play his club. I think to myself - if only Captain David Bailey were here. He'd practically be in tears by now. </p> <p>Captain Bailey is the man who created Oxsigen for the British army's element of Nato's stabilisation force SFOR. He almost single-handedly built the station's prefab hut studios on the metal factory base. Oxsigen is a dance station, programmed and scheduled just like Kiss, Galaxy or Radio 1, although with curious ad breaks which carry only advice and information on mine clearance and learning to live together again. When Radio 1 says One Love on air, it's a corporate slogan. When Oxsigen's local Serbian, Croat and Bosniac Muslim DJs say it, they mean let's all stop shooting each other. </p> <p>Bailey has been working on the station for two years - an unusually long period in Bosnia where most soldiers only do a six-month tour - but he clearly loves radio. It was his desperate enthusiasm which got Boy George to play on the station: Bailey contacted Wise Buddah which - with George - was so impressed by the outfit that it basically gave him the show for nothing. </p> <p>\"It sounds a bit naive in the UK to talk about dance music changing things, but there's something about it that really brings people together,\" says Boy George. \"That's why we were so happy to give them the show. The generation in Britain before acid house was uptight, homophobic and unsophisticated. Clubbing was about ultra-hip exclusivity and knowing the right people. Since acid house, kids from Britain are now far more sophisticated. I get no one giving me grief because I'm queer and happy, so that can work out in Bosnia too. We're hoping to do some DJ dates there - I'll be the first western DJ out since the war - and it'd be great if Serbian, Croatian and Muslim kids could all be dancing together in the same nightclub.\" </p> <p>Captain Bailey credits George's show with building the station's success. \"Out here there's no radio research, so we have to do what the rest of the local stations do - calculate how many listeners we have from the calls, letters and emails we get,\" he explains. \"That method gives us a 19% share and makes us the most popular station in our area, which I think is a bit optimistic. I reckon we've probably got around 16%, and I'm quite happy with that.\" </p> <p>It's curious for, well, how many reasons do you want? For a start, this is the British army we're talking about. The unit responsible for creating Bosnia's own Kiss FM is called info ops, or in the American army's terrifying newspeak, psyops - psychological operations. This is the section of the military that spent the second world war dropping leaflets over Germany urging all soldiers to overthrow Hitler and surrender. Given the outstandingly poor results that the leaflets delivered, it's no surprise that the section was pretty hard hit in the army's popularity charts and by the time the Gulf war rolled round it didn't really exist. </p> <p>The Americans had kept this whole business going, however, and spent much of the cold war broadcasting \"join capitalism\" messages into places such as Cuba and eastern Europe. Their Gulf war operations had some success and the Brits were impressed. Come the occupation of Bosnia, info ops was back up and running and trying to work out what best to do with its radio frequencies as delivered by the international media commission before Bailey's radio enthusiasm offered an answer. </p> <p>The French and the Americans were also given frequencies for their stations and the Americans are doing just what you'd expect the Brits to do. Their station is very formal and laced with ads for peace that would make a media novice cringe. In one advert, a couple are doing a crossword and the bloke's stumped on a clue. \"Six letters meaning peace...\" he wonders. \"Why darling, that's Dayton,\" she coos. And you can almost hear the militia laying down their arms. </p> <p>The Brits appear to have embraced clubland for inspiration, using Oxsigen. It has also created a free weekly magazine called Mostovi which is handed out by patrolling soldiers and distributed around shops and town centres. </p> <p>Mostovi similarly eschews any sort of heavy-handed SFOR propaganda. Instead, it has a diet of celebrity interviews and lifestyle features with news about all areas of Bosnia Herzegovina - as local media in the Republic of Serbska refuse to write about the Bosnian Croat Federation and vice versa. Of course, there's also mine-clearing information and stories about war criminals which jar to my British eyes when placed next to a feature on George Clooney. </p> <p>\"Our job is to support the mission for SFOR,\" explains Major Nigel Jones, whose job title runs to the delicious SO2 information campaign, HQ multi national division south west. \"And that's to maintain a safe and secure environment. To me, that means stopping people going back to war. To do that, we have to try and change the way they see each other and change what they think is an acceptable way to resolve disputes. With the radio, we're targeting the young. We've got multi-ethnic presenters, give unbiased news - including news that is critical of SFOR - and we work on the premise that if the magazine we produce is boring and worthy then no one's going to read it.\" </p> <p>Up in Prijador - the town where ITN filmed those infamous concentration camp-like scenes of starving Croats behind barbed wire - two of the station's 18-year-old listeners chat about its popularity. \"I listen because it gets the new music quicker than local stations,\" says Rada, a Serbian girl. \"I listen to it because it is the only station where I can speak my mind,\" says Alecsandra. \"There's almost 300 radio stations out here and all of them are controlled by political factions,\" she explains. \"I call Oxsigen's phone-ins because I've seen and heard things I shouldn't have and I need to tell someone.\" </p> <p>And so she tells me. Her dad is Serbian and her mum is Muslim. When she was 11 years old, the locals burned down her next-door neighbours' house because they were Muslims. She lay awake that night hearing her neighbours' screams as they burned to death, wondering if her mother was next. Now she wants to leave. It all looks grim to her and she's the sort of person the station needs to reassure. </p> <p>Back in the club, you could believe there is some hope. The squaddies have split and they're all in the middle of the dance floor, hands in the air as the DJ builds a storming set. There are Croats and Serbs and Bosnians here and people may be slagging off SFOR but they're buying the squaddies rounds of Amstel. The guy on the podium with the lurid green glo-sticks steps down and chats to me about music, always music, and doesn't want to know when I get on to politics, so that just for one, naive, 1988 Summer Of Love moment you actually do think that music could make a difference. Or maybe that's just the beer talking. </p>",

  "<p>Life has moved on since the streets of Seattle were awash with riot police last December. Then, it was the protesters who called the shots while trade ministers bickered inside the convention centre. In Prague, the anti-globalisation forces have yet to make their presence felt, allowing ministers from the G7 to seize the initiative. </p> <p>Suddenly, intervention is no longer a dirty word. Friday's G7 action to prop up the euro and the moves over the weekend to bring down the oil price in part reflected real concerns about the threats posed to global growth by currency imbalances and rising fuel prices. But it also underlined the welcome return to a more activist approach. </p> <p>A cynical view would be that the west can act when it is in its interests. America's support for intervention to reduce the value of the dollar was prompted by the earbashing the Clinton administration has been getting from multinationals unhappy about the impact of a weak euro on export earnings from Europe. But when Canada's finance minister, Paul Martin, urged creditor countries to support a moratorium on debt repayments from the world's poorest countries there was no obvious selfish motive. </p> <p>The importance of the actions on Friday and Saturday is that they legitimise intervention in other spheres, from trade to the environment. Once it has been accepted that markets need to be managed by strong and effective institutions, all sorts of possibilities open up. Policymakers have been made painfully aware in the past couple of weeks how easy it is for a combination of fuel shortages and just-in-time production methods to bring a modern economy to a standstill. There is far greater willingness for action - both individually and collectively - to tackle market imperfections and market failures. </p> <p>The IMF's half-yearly world economic outlook, released last week, provided an excellent overview of the state of play. While the dark clouds that hovered over the global economy two years ago have lifted, the fund warned that there could be more on the horizon. In particular, it expressed concern about the \"misalignments among major currencies\", the risk of a supply shock caused by higher oil prices and that there could be a sharp correction in US share prices. </p> <p>To be fair to the fund, it has been highlighting the risks of a hard landing in the US for some time, but until now nobody took its comments seriously. The status of Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan as the man who can master markets has left Americans convinced that a soft landing is inevitable. They have just started to grasp the idea that nobody - not even the redoubtable Mr Greenspan - is perfect and that in recent years soft landings have all too often turned into crash landings. </p> <p>The strength of the dollar has allowed Americans to believe that the good times can go on for ever. A strong currency has kept inflation low and attracted enough foreign capital to allow the US to continue living beyond its means and to keep the stock market over-valued. When Mr Greenspan cut interest rates two years ago, that helped save the global economy from meltdown, but gave a boost to the US economy at a time when it should have been getting a touch on the brakes. </p> <p>Monetary policy was subsequently tightened, however, and is now having an effect. Higher interest rates and an over-valued currency mean that the economy is slowing pretty rapidly, something which has been lost on foreign exchange dealers but not on the men and women who run American corporations. As Larry Summers, the US treasury secretary, made clear on Friday, Washington is not abandoning its strong dollar policy, but its support for the intervention to defend the euro suggests that it would like a euro-dollar exchange rate of between 90 and 95 cents. </p> <p><strong> Shortening the odds</strong><br> </p> <p> Markets will test the resolve of the G7 this week, and it is crucial that the authorities are not found wanting. Intervention is not like a poker game where you can fold early; having gambled, you have to stick it out. It is true that investment flows reveal great confidence in the US economy, but there is a long history of investors piling into countries just at the moment when the economy is about to take a turn for the worse. </p> <p>Rising oil prices are an added complication, because they cause a loss of real incomes at a time when the labour market in the US is tight. Inflation will rise if workers try to compensate for the reduction in purchasing power by bargaining for higher pay. In those circumstances, interest rates would go up still further, shortening the odds on a hard landing. The communique issued by the G7 at the end of its meeting on Saturday underlined the concern about escalating energy costs, but that is a less significant problem than misaligned exchange rates. Much of the recent rise has been the result of speculation in the futures markets and will unwind once it becomes apparent that the US and Europe are slowing. </p> <p>So, if the US can see some merit in co-ordinated action on the world stage, so much the better. Now is the time for those who have campaigned hard for debt relief, for fairer trade rules, for a more democratic system of international governance, and for reform of the bank and the fund to redouble their efforts. Globalisation has spawned its own opposition in the form of non-governmental organisations that have proved effective in exposing the weakness and inadequacies of the current international order. The NGOs are right to say that much still needs to be done to curb the violent excesses of the global financial markets, protect the environment and to tackle poverty in the developing world. The series of catastrophes - financial, political and environmental - that started in Thailand in 1997 and culminated in Seattle only served to underline the point. </p> <p>Some of these developments appear to have been lost on those who have turned up in Prague with the hope that they can abolish the bank and the fund as the first stage in putting an end to globalisation. Even in its basic conception, this plan makes little sense because the real power in the global economy is vested with the finance ministers and central bank governors of the G7, not the bureaucrats in the Bretton Woods institutions. The bank and the fund act for the G7 in much the same way as Whitehall does for the Cabinet; they translate decisions into actions. Ultimately they take their orders from their big shareholders, the G7. Anybody who tried to argue that Britain would be better off without a civil service would be given short shrift, and rightly so. </p> <p>However, the real objection to those who propose smashing up the international system is that they do not have any idea what should replace it. The vague hankering for a pre-industrial utopia may appeal to well-heeled eco-toffs, for whom real hardship is when the gardener fails to turn up twice a week, but it is the politics of sixth-form common rooms, not the real world. Progressives have the chance to reshape global institutions; they should not flunk it. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:larry.elliott@theguardian.com\">larry.elliott@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "The world's leading industrial nations stepped up pressure on oil producers last night to increase supplies of crude oil to the west after expressing serious concern about the impact of higher energy prices on rich and poor countries. <p>A strongly worded statement from the International Monetary Fund's key decision-making committee warned of the dangers of higher inflation and slower growth resulting from more expensive oil and put the onus on Opec to announce fresh output increases at its summit in Caracas, Venezuela, this week. </p> <p>The IMF's move followed tough language on Saturday from the G7 nations which called on the oil cartel to take immediate action to reverse the recent trend in oil prices, which has seen the cost of a barrel of crude triple from around $10 to $32.60 since the start of last year. </p> <p>Horst K\u00f6hler, the managing director of the IMF, and the chancellor, Gordon Brown, who chairs the fund's international monetary and finance committee, met Hamad Al-Sayari, governor of Saudi Arabia's central bank, yesterday in an attempt to broker a deal with oil producers. </p> <p>This will be followed up by the French finance minister, Laurent Fabius, who will write to all producer countries this week pressing for action to increase production. </p> <p>Mr K\u00f6hler said he was confident that progress would soon be made, adding that both oil producers and oil consumers among the IMF's 182 member governments were worried about recent trends in prices. </p> <p>A statement issued at the end of yesterday's meeting of the IMF committee - which includes Saudi Arabia, Algeria and the United Arab Emirates among its 24 members - underlined the concerted attempt by the west to bring prices down. It said: \"The committee is concerned that current oil prices, if sustained, could hamper global growth, add to inflationary pressures, and adversely affect prospects for many countries.\" </p> <p>The communique added that there was joint agreement on the need to stabilise oil markets around reasonable long-term prices. \"The committee notes the steps the oil-producing countries have taken this year to increase production and calls on them to take further steps to create conditions in oil markets conducive to healthy global growth.\" </p> <p>Mr Brown said he was encouraged by the amount of common ground between oil consuming and producing countries. </p> <p>Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, said that Britain was better placed than many to absorb the impact of higher oil prices because inflation was below the government's 2.5% target. But he said the Bank's monetary policy committee would be watching closely to make sure that higher oil prices did not feed through into higher prices in the rest of the economy. </p> <p>In a communique released after its meeting on Saturday, the G7 welcomed the US decision to release oil from its strategic stockpile, adding: \"It is important that world oil prices return to a level consistent with lasting global economic prosperity and stability for both oil producing and consuming countries and, in particular, for the poor developing countries. </p> <p>\"In the light of continuing high prices and low level of stocks, it is crucial for the world economy that Opec and other oil producing countries take actions to contribute to a reduction in oil prices and greater stability in oil markets.\" </p> <p>Stung by the virulence of fuel protests and fearful that higher oil prices could lead to a recession, the G7 said it had to make more efficient use of energy. But it made it clear that Opec was being held primarily responsible for bringing prices down to a range of between $22 and $28 a barrel. </p> <p>Larry Summers, the US treasury secretary, said oil prices were \"perhaps the largest cloud in a relatively blue sky\".</p>",

  "<p>BP's new logo will appear on petrol station forecourts lining autobahns as part of a deal under discussion between the British oil company and German utility RWE to merge their continental fuel retailing businesses. </p> <p>The new operation, taking in RWE's 2,600 service stations, would be the second largest petrol group in Germany, behind Aral. </p> <p>A source close to the talks yesterday said discussions on a joint venture have been under way for some time, but he stressed that agreement had yet to be reached. </p> <p>Details of the talks, which involve RWE injecting its oil refining assets as well as the petrol stations into a joint venture run by BP, emerged on the eve of today's expected confirmation of RWE's \u00a34.3bn takeover of Thames Water. </p> <p>The German utility has made no secret of its desire to dispose of its oil-related assets, grouped under the DEA banner and thought to be worth around \u00a31.2bn, to become a global player in the water industry.

Thames' long experience in deregulated and privatised water supply would give it the necessary management skills to exploit new opportunities in Germany. </p> <p>Globally, water remains a fragmented industry, but French companies Vivendi Environment and Suez Lyonnaise are already exploiting consolidation opportunities in the United States and elsewhere. </p> <p>Thames does not have the clout to take on the French companies on its own, but RWE is one of Europe's \"big six\" utilities, with a market capitalisation of about \u20ac21bn (\u00a312.7bn). A planned merger with fellow German utility VEW will add a further \u20ac2.7bn and make it Germany's largest electricity producer. </p> <p>Following the acquisitions of Amoco, Atlantic Richfield and Burmah Castrol, the DEA merger would be the fourth large deal for BP in the past two years. </p> <p>Shell is also thought to have held discussions about buying DEA but is no longer interested. </p> <p><strong>Useful links</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.rwe.de/english\"> RWE group</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.bp.com\">BP</a></p>",
  "<p>\u0095 What is it about the secretary that makes her (and, as far as this tale goes, it is a \"her\" we're talking about) a prime target for casting in the role of plucky heroine? Usually one of two types, admittedly - either the lowly admin girl done good, or plain Jane turned catwalk stunner - but, as far as WPM is concerned, a girl's got to take whatever adoration she can get. </p> <p>The latest in a long line of Miss Joneses is Betty, star of Colombian soap opera, I Am Betty, The Ugly One (clearly a woman with supportive colleagues), who has managed, in the space of just a few episodes, to save her boss from bankruptcy and restore the fortunes of her ailing company. Around 28m Colombians watch it every night, presumably to reaffirm their suspicions that, yes, bosses are stupid, and, yes, secretaries do wear horn-rimmed spectacles. The first category of secretary-heroine safely under her (no doubt rather unfashionable) belt, will Ugly Betty ditch the specs and get her man? The show's creators have, of course, prepared for this eventuality by casting a not unattractive actress to play our girl. \"She had to be pretty,\" they insist, \"just in case Betty gets a makeover at the end of the series.\" Just in case? </p> <p> \u0095 Excitement in New York, where the twin towers of the World Trade Center, the largest commercial office buildings on earth, have come up for sale. The $2.5bn (\u00a31.77bn) price tag, though, means that the big-name companies eager to move their staff to altitude-sickness heights might have to buddy up with rivals to afford the leasehold. WPM can only imagine the fights there'll be over who gets the biggest/smartest/highest office. A little cubbyhole next to the lifts and the fire escape would suit us just fine.</p> <p>\u0095 This week's favoured website is <a href=\"http://www.smartEric.com\">www.smartEric.com</a>, a site dedicated to the self-employed which actually recognises the existence of home-based secretarial workers. There's advice on working from home, and help with the little things that are taken care of when you work in an office, such as supplies and sanity. Online job ads here are pretty thin on the ground, but the site does offer a service whereby office-based secretaries can search for freelance admin assistants to help out in temporary positions, via the CV database and personalised homepages.</p> <p>\u0095 Another site did - almost literally - give smartEric a run for his money this week, though. WPM was intrigued to learn of former athlete and current Hague-ite Seb Coe's 15-minute \"desk-ercise\" workout, as featured on his website at <a href=\"http://www.jarvis.co.uk/sebcoe\">www.jarvis.co.uk/sebcoe</a> Not intrigued enough to try it out, of course, although the online illustrations prove just how easy it is to burn calories in the office without so much as breaking into a sweat. After checking with the boss that it's OK to make use of the office furniture (some companies presumably have policies against just this kind of timewasting and desk-bashing), Coe recommends a series of squats, thrusts and ski jumps, after a warm-up consisting of marching briskly on the spot for two minutes. The fun they must have in Conservative central office. </p> <p>\u0095 More research concludes that if you consistently feel sick at work, your computer could be to blame. Any excuse... </p> <p>\u0095 WPM really does hate to be cynical, but some bubbles are just pleading to be burst. According to a global survey by Ernst and Young of 800 college students (including a sample of \"tomorrow's business leaders\" in the UK), a blithely optimistic 75% believe that they will one day become millionaires, with 5% plumping for their 20s to be the decade that they make their seven-figure fortune. These are presumably the same 5% who envisage retiring before they hit 30. But, lest we suspect that they're not thinking straight, only 6% believe that they'll end up as dot.com billionaires. Ambition is one thing, but that would just be taking things too far. </p> <p>\u0095 Office Hours readers (and non-readers) who wish to get hold of a copy of the survey Tomorrow's Work, as featured in our report on the future of the workplace in last week's issue, can do so via Kelly Services.

Resist the temptation to knock your previous boss or firm - it looks unprofessional. </p> <p>* If you are asked to supply a hand-written letter, then make sure it's your best handwriting - trickier than it sounds in these keyboard-only days. </p> <p>* It seems like stating the obvious but don't let mistakes slip through. If you send off a covering letter explaining that you \"single-handedly ruin the sales support\", you can expect your masterpiece to find its way to the bin. </p> <p>* The other job application no-no is to embellish the truth. It never pays. Interviews are stressful enough without worrying when they're going to ask you about the fictitious community link programme you mentioned to add a bit of interest. Even if you squeak through the interview, you may still be found out later and dismissed. </p> <p>* When you're happy with your letter, print it on the same stationery as your CV and pop it in the post. Giving it a kiss for luck is an option, providing you don't leave a lipstick print on the envelope (not advisable for male applicants).</p> <p>\u0095 Penny Cottee is editor of Executive PA magazine</p>"
