  "<p>Often described as the most formidable woman in British television, Patricia Hodgson is at the door of her new habitat, the chief executive's office of the independent television commission (ITC). She is beaming with pleasure; or it may be power. </p> <p>Minutes into the interview she has dispensed with the habitual caution of a BBC lifer and is speaking recklessly. Formerly John Birt's right-hand woman, she played the villain's part to perfection as his much-loathed director of policy and planning. Now she has left the BBC, she's \"going for it\", prepared to risk a showdown. </p> <p>Her agenda is to salvage the ITC from extinction: to fix the row with ITV over News at Ten by the end of this month; save the thing she cares about most - public service broadcasting - and ensure the forthcoming white paper on media, communications and \"convergence\" remembers that broadcasting has cultural obligations. No mean feat. </p> <p>As she sees it, the ITC, as the licensing body until new legislation comes in, has the power to make public service broadcasting worthwhile in business terms. It can cut the annual \"levy\" payments by ITV, and negotiate altered terms (\"don't call it relaxation\"), but in return for more programme investment. Seven licence-holders, including Central, LWT and Granada, are about to apply to renew their franchises and, consequently, renegotiate their annual licence payments. The ITC still controls some important levers and Hodgson has the nerve to use them. </p> <p>Her determination was apparent when she spoke at last week's Guardian Edinburgh International Television Festival about the forthcoming white paper. Her appointment - she starts officially today - changes the balance of the regulatory environment. Her predecessor, Peter Rogers, was shy and decent but lacked the confidence of the industry; with his retirement, the ITC could become far more assertive. </p> <p>In her Edinburgh speech, she also gave her views on the BBC governors. \"They are needed,\" she said, \"to keep the BBC management honest. They should be strong enough to keep politicians at bay. But they, too, must be accountable. They can't convincingly embody the BBC and then also judge it.\" BBC chairman Sir Christopher Bland accepts this, she says. </p> <p>Back to the ITC. \"I took the job because it is an opportunity to make a difference. The challenge is to achieve a new settlement for public service broadcasting, to take the free-to-air networks [ITV, Channel 4, Channel 5] into the new digital age over the next 10 years.\" It is very late in the day, she concedes, but possible. ITV is being offered a deal. She will move \"further and faster on [simplifying] regulation\", with the prospect of more \"flexible\" schedules and advertising controls. But it must keep faith with its most important public service duties, providing \"range and quality\" - above all, serious news and modernised current affairs. </p> <p>The clue to Hodgson is that she is a politician manqu\u00e9. At Cambridge she was a committee member of the university Conservative association, then worked for the Conservative Research Department, even contesting a London seat. She plays the political chess game like a grandmaster - unlike the ITC before her arrival, with its abandonment of News at Ten two years ago. The ITC has \"not been sufficiently confident of its skills and professionalism in a changing world,\" she says. \"It needs confidence.\" </p> <p>Her answer is strengthened leadership - ie, herself - and new recruits with economic and strategic expertise - presumably ex-colleagues from BBC policy and planning looking for a new world to conquer. The watchdog could then regain the ear of government. </p> <p>But the first aim, clear in Edinburgh, is a face-saving deal with ITV before it goes to court at the end of this month for a judicial review of the commission's edict effectively ordering the broadcaster to restore News at Ten. The two sides can \"talk up to the courtroom door,\" Hodgson says. </p> <p>She pounced instantly on an olive branch offered by Charles Allen, chief executive of Granada Media Group. Hodgson scents a deal. \"It's the first time anyone of great seniority and influence has wanted to talk.\" </p> <p>It is her good fortune to take over as ITV consolidates into two big power blocs, far easier to deal with, and when one awkward baron, Lord Hollick, is exiting. Salvaging the ITC's reputation rests on keeping this dispute out of court. \"We shouldn't be where we are,\" says Hodgson, insisting that \"it's not about the 10pm slot\" - though she repeats that \"11pm is too late\". She says there are plenty of other options now that the BBC is switching its news to 10pm; the important thing is to ensure optimum accessibility to improve audiences. </p> <p>Taking a line calculated to please politicians, Hodgson argues that \"however excellent the BBC news is, dominance by any news service is not good for democracy.\" Some news, she says, inevitably then \"gets left out\". </p> <p>If the dispute proceeds to judicial review, she says, \"it will tie my hands in modernising regulation [as ITV wants] ... I might have the best scheme in the world to simplify regulation, but how can we talk about it if we're having a great big barney?\" </p> <p>Her other priority is to mould the white paper on media convergence, and, one suspects, temper the drive, led by the Department of Trade and Industry, towards a telecoms-driven regime where social obligations scarcely feature. She is seeking recognition that terrestrial networks need \"transitional arrangements\" in which consumer protection and duties, such as investment in high-quality regional programmes, can be traded for privileges, such as guarantees of being given prominence on all platforms and electronic programme guides. </p> <p>But this is not what ITV executives seem to worry about in public. Rather, they cry out for a level playing field with freedom to dump genres such as religion and compete head-on with the likes of Sky. </p> <p>\"When their minds are focused, ITV executives recognise the validity of the requirements of diversity,\" Hodgson says. \"I have a good deal of sympathy with their frustrations. Now ITV is settling its ownership issues we'll start talking about the right mix of self-set aspirational and mandatory targets.\" </p> <p>She wants to open discussions with licensees and the government, and also see a proper digital strategy in place for ITV, akin to the BBC's which she helped to devise, and Channel 4's. \"My hope is to make content regulation simpler, clearer, less complex, to reflect all the things ITV complains of, but holding onto the essentials.\" She points to the success of the tougher yet aspirational Channel 4 licence agreement introduced two years ago as a model: multi-cultural programmes, for example, have been moved out of ghetto slots to prime time. </p> <p>In her Edinburgh speech, Hodgson asked: \"Will the multi-channel interactive world provide all the content audiences need?\" She, naturally, answered her own question: \"Given the power and pervasive nature of the electronic media, I think we'll continue to do so in a big way. How it's done, through the BBC, through privileges for some players on the commercial side, needs to be worked out. Someone has to do that, with, but independent of, government.\" It's a vision that handily keeps the ITC, or something like it, in business. </p> <p>Once described by Guardian writer Dave Hill as \"a woman apparently sculpted from deep-frozen Oil of Ulay\", Hodgson has never been short of detractors. Behind her back some of the important executives she has to rub along with range from sceptical to antagonistic (told this, she just says \"what fun!\"). Asked about hostile predictions that she will bring a bossy BBC perspective to a commercial sector where she has never worked, she counters that she \"learned a fair bit about the commercial world when I served on the monopolies and mergers commission [forerunner to the competition commission] for six years.\" Instead of \"nannying\" the network, her aim is \"a new deal - to achieve simpler regulations, and only when they're needed\". Far from imposing a BBC perspective, she backs further consolidation: \"One ITV is the target. It is not only inevitable, it is desirable.\" </p> <p>Another charge is that she has a personal agenda, to emerge from the expected cull of watchdogs as top dog, regulating the content of electronic media (and those BBC governors), within or outside of a new economic regulator, called perhaps Ofcom. She simply wants to ensure the ITC is respected, and works with other regulators to \"design together a new framework\", she answers. </p> <p>Those who admire Hodgson - citing such BBC coups as the renewal of its charter in 1996, and this year's licence fee settlement, which makes possible Greg Dyke's new programme spending - say she will be a very good thing for the ITC, and its currently anxious staff. And for viewers. </p> <p>At Edinburgh, Dyke used his MacTaggart lecture to opine that advertising-funded channels such as ITV will find it hard as television fragments. Hodgson responds with vigour. \"Greg is wrong. All free-to-air channels will be showcases for much bigger media companies. The money will be there. I love this sector, and I have an opportunity to get it right.\" </p> <p>Not to be under-estimated.</p>",
  "<p>Scotland today is the Fleet Street of the 30s. Newspapers are engaged in a vicious circulation war, with groups using every possible device to win readers. The weapons are commercial - price-cutting gimmicks, massive \"sampling\" giveaways and promotional lures - but the pressure on editors to produce saleable papers, to ensure that the casual buyers stay, is immense. </p> <p>It is possible, therefore, to put Martin Clarke's departure as editor of the Daily Record in this context. That would suggest that he is just another casualty in the debilitating round of journalistic blood-letting. </p> <p>Then again, Clarke stands out from the crowd. There can be little doubt that he was monstrously behaved, exhibiting the man-management skills of a galley-master on a Greek trireme. </p> <p>There are legions of stories about his ranting and raving in the office, his rudeness to subordinates and his lack of respect for his superiors. It is also obvious that he alienated his paper's traditional political allies in the Labour party. In his enthusiasm to end the so-called cosy relationship with the party hierarchy, he went too far. </p> <p>Not only did he upset the party, it is highly likely that he annoyed habitual Labour voters among his readership, too. Similarly, his controversial campaign against the repeal of Clause 28 may well have played well with older buyers but is thought to have bemused, and even incensed, younger people. </p> <p>Then there is the not unimportant matter of circulation. The Daily Record has sold fewer and fewer copies since Clarke arrived in April 1998 when it was selling 671,000. By April this year (the fairest of comparisons) it had fallen to 618,000, a drop of almost 8%. </p> <p>But that does not give anything like the whole picture. The Record has enjoyed - how shall I put this tactfully? - an oddly high level of sales in Spain. It has also been reliant on increasing numbers of bulk giveaways. </p> <p>As if that wasn't bad enough, rival circulation managers claim the paper's Scots-only sale dipped as low as 516,000 last week. Even if that's an exaggeration, and Trinity-Mirror argue that its monthly year-on-year sale will show a slight rise when the next officially audited figures are published, the sales situation is dire. </p> <p>Not that Clarke can be held entirely responsible for that. The Record held sway in Scotland for a couple of generations as its main competitors retreated south of the border. For years, the Daily Express and Daily Mail virtually abandoned Scotland. Even the Sun was slow to make its mark there. </p> <p>But once the whole newspaper market began to slide in the early 90s, managements desperate to boost circulation showed a renewed interest in Scotland, turning it into the most competitive newspaper environment of modern times. In most of the larger cities, there are at least 15 daily morning titles on the news-stands, with a 16th, the Swedish-owned Business am, about to be launched in three weeks' time. The populous Glasgow-Edinburgh central region is also served by a free Metro, which has a distribution of 120,000 copies. </p> <p>To be frank, in a country of 5.1m, the market is overheated. Even some Scottish editors agree with me that there are too many titles chasing too few readers, not to mention the problems of too few good journalists to staff the papers, and too few good stories to publish. </p> <p>The Scots don't seem to mind. With almost every title slashing its cover price, they can cherry-pick the cheapest available paper. The latest Daily Express voucher mail shot is offering one issue a week for just 1p. </p> <p>In such a climate, with buyers able to judge value for money every day, it isn't hard to see why a 20p Scotsman and a 20p Times might be preferred over a 48p Herald. It is surely creditable that the Herald has managed to keep a 95,000 sale so far, but price-cutting isn't any longer a short-term weapon. It is a war of attrition and it is difficult to forecast the outcome. </p> <p>Among the red-tops, the Daily Record has found it harder to retain reader loyalty for a paper selling at 32p against a cheaper Mirror and a Sun which slips in 15p issues on a weekly basis. Price-cutting also helped the Daily Mail to build a healthy sale before it reverted to its proper cover price. </p> <p>The result has seen the Sun climb to an astonishing 400,000, double its sale three years ago, and the Mirror to 60,000 from almost zero. With the Mail at 120,000 and rising, and the Express at almost 90,000, the Daily Record has borne the brunt of the onslaught. </p> <p>Not surprisingly, Clarke's friends contend that his owners have failed to provide him with the resources to fight back, implying that Trinity-Mirror's treatment of the Record as a regional rather than national title inhibits proper investment. They claim the lack of management understanding explains why he was prone to lose his temper so often. </p> <p>A Trinity-Mirror source scoffed at any such suggestion. \"It sounds,\" he said witheringly, \"like the squeal of the last little piggy down the ramp into the abattoir.\" </p> <p>But one of Clarke's friends countered: \"In a war like the one we have here it makes no sense to remove the man recognised as the toughest, meanest general from the battlefield.\" </p> <p>That's probably the reason Clarke was shocked when Trinity-Mirror's chief executive Philip Graf fired him at a tense meeting in Canary Wharf. The arrogant and abrasive Clarke simply had no inkling he was for the chop. </p> <p>So can the new editor, Peter Cox, who is moving from the Record's stable-mate, the Sunday Mail, expect to do better? He is a more amenable, amiable character. Even when I criticised him harshly for one of his stories, he didn't lose his sense of humour and was prepared to fight his corner without rancour. </p> <p>His paper has been unimpressive, and has also shed some readers, but it has remained coherent - the Record, meanwhile, has been erratic: sensational one minute and overly serious and dull the next. </p> <p>Cox did pursue a much more sympathetic line over Clause 28 and, after an initial hiccup, has offered tacit support to the Labour administration of Scottish first minister Donald Dewar. It was surely significant that his first Daily Record front page, on Friday, contained the pro-Dewar headline, \"Well Don!\"</p>",
  "<p> \"I 'm a Sinatra man,\" says Michael Parkinson proudly when I ask him how he felt interviewing Victoria Beckham. He is explaining that he doesn't necessarily have a large stockpile of Spice Girls records, and that, frankly, he doesn't care. Parky is at that happy age where he doesn't have to fret about appearing fashionable. </p> <p>A quick look at the guest list for his new chat show series, starting on Friday, emphasises the point: Andrew Lloyd Webber, Julie Walters, Mark Knopfler, Mike Reid, Robson Green. People with a bit of hinterland, and with in some cases a past that might be brighter than their present. Fame is fickle, but Parkinson's admiration isn't. </p> <p>\"I don't like people who, in my judgment, are chancers,\" says Parkinson. \"I have to think that the reason a guest is on the show is that he's bloody good at what he does. My attitude towards people coming on the show is not 'Do I like them?' but 'Do I admire them?' \" </p> <p>I meet Parkinson at a favourite restaurant of his in Mayfair - quiet, friendly, dignified and ever so slightly old world. My opening line is the predictable one - my terror at interviewing the supreme interviewer. \"That's bollocks,\" he says. \"I'm not bad at what I do. But it's a certain area of interviewing. People tend to lump all interviewers together, but that's unfair. I can't do what Paxman does, or what Robin Day did. I'm not made that way.\" </p> <p>Parkinson once said his aim was to let his guests \"give the best of themselves to his audience\". A rather peculiar aim, I suggest. Shouldn't he be trying to find out what makes them tick, expose the private person behind the public face? \"The people I interview are not war criminals,\" he says. \"The only thing they've ever done, generally speaking, is entertain people. What's interesting is to find out why and how. </p> <p>\"A situation has developed where an interview isn't an interview unless there's blood on the carpet. I'd make a fool of myself if I tried to do that, and I don't see why the people who sit opposite me deserve that kind of treatment. The thing that I was most afraid of coming back was that that particular aspect of television had changed and that my show might seem very old-fashioned. It might look that way still, but the fact of the matter is there was an audience who wanted that.\" </p> <p>What Parkinson calls his \"second coming\" occurred in 1998, when - older, wiser and a good deal greyer - he returned to BBC1 16 years after his original, much-loved, much-feted chat show ended. It was, as he admits, a huge risk. \"I would have hated to come back and do a bad show that was badly received and made me skulk away thinking, 'Christ, I wish I'd never done that.' It was nice to come back and do a good show. That's what pleases me professionally. Reactions have been better than I could ever have imagined.\" </p> <p>It was typical of Parkinson that, despite 16 years away, nothing much had changed: the furniture looked the same; the stairs were still there; even the Harry Stoneham Five, whose music had seemed dated back in the early 80s, were still swinging. Only the guests were different, because the generation of Hollywood stars he had brilliantly caught at the end of their careers in the 70s were dying out. Cagney, Astaire, Crosby, Matthau, Niven - his cast list was remarkable and the resulting interviews legendary. </p> <p>Parkinson, who is now 65, recognises that the old order has changed. \"That great swathe of Hollywood film stars who were brought up through the studio system has gone, and they've not been replaced because what created them has gone as well. They'd also been through a war, those men and women, so they had a dimension which is more than being an actor; they weren't as blown away by their fame as some are today. The other thing that has changed is the power of the agent: there is far more undergrowth to get through.\" </p> <p>But he rejects the argument that there are no decent guests any more, and cites Paul McCartney (\"I'd been chasing him for 25 years\") and Woody Allen (\"I admire him inordinately\") as examples of recent interviewees who could be mentioned in the same breath as some of the ancients. </p> <p>But Ali, there'll never be another Ali, I say weepily. Parkinson becomes animated. \"Tiger Woods, he's Ali isn't he? In my lifetime I've seen two of the greatest ever superstars in sport: Ali was the first; this guy is the second. He's sensational. I'd love to do him.\" </p> <p>I had assumed that the guests for the entire series were already mapped out, but Parkinson and his team keep it flexible and like to strike the moment. \"We don't plan that far ahead. We've got enough to do the first three or four shows. It's not so much a question of getting one guest; it's a question of fitting three guests into a show. That's the fascination of the job. Any silly bugger can book one person and just stick two other people with them. The trick is to think about the combination. The difference between my show and others is that we have that conversational arena - three people who have to talk or we all look like idiots.\" </p> <p>The show is recorded the night before transmission and is only lightly edited. \"I shoot to time. I'm very old-fashioned about things like that because that's the background I came up in. I started in live television, so I just do it as live. I believe that if you over-record, it shows. The continuity is difficult: people age before your eyes. It's sloppy, awful.\" </p> <p>But there must be times when it goes wrong, when guests dry up or give monosyllabic answers and you are left babbling into endless silences? \"It's up to you to make it work. It doesn't not work too often, and it will only happen for two reasons - they're pissed or they're frightened. There's no cure for the former condition, as I know to my cost, but with the latter you can settle people down and take a bit longer to get them going. Then subtly edit: those will be the times that we go over, when the person doesn't respond immediately. And if it doesn't work at all, you have to be fatalistic about it - you can't win them all.\" </p> <p>Doesn't he sometimes wish he could entertain less and probe more? \"It's not In the Psychiatrist's Chair, but there's more than one way of skinning a rabbit. Once in an interview you have the person opposite you - in a totally phoney situation, which is television - trusting you. Then you can ask them anything you want. I asked Woody Allen about marrying his step-daughter, which was a fair question. It was a legitimate line of enquiry. He objected to it and said I was being voyeuristic, but I said no I'm not, this has had an effect on your career. I wasn't the slightest bit embarrassed by it, but I would have been if there hadn't been a point to it. It did affect his career - in Middle America it had an effect - and it was a legitimate question to ask.\" </p> <p>Parkinson admires his guests, is perhaps occasionally in awe of them, but he is never intimidated by them. \"I'm the boss, not them. It's my patch, not theirs. This is my home. That's why we never take the show on the road. They've got to come down my stairs into my living room and talk to me.\" </p> <p>He abandoned that cosy living room for the harsh commercial world in 1982, when he and fellow broadcasting luminaries David Frost, Anna Ford, Angela Rippon and Robert Kee set up TV-am. They won the ITV morning franchise, but then lost control of the company in a bitter boardroom battle. \"We did the difficult thing against the strongest group of bidders there has ever been,\" he says, \"but then we lost the bloody thing.\" </p> <p>Parkinson then did Desert Island Discs for 18 months, but had a well-publicised falling out with Roy Plomley's widow and left the programme. \"Mrs Plomley decided that I was a rough country boy with a terrible accent who shouldn't be allowed anyway near her husband's programme,\" he says with undisguised bitterness. </p> <p> It was not a happy period for Parkinson, compounded by the fact that he started drinking heavily, but he emphasises that he never stopped working - or earning. \"I was treading water but I didn't go under. I kept on working. I did lots of jobs, some of which I'm not particularly pleased to see on my CV, but on the other hand I'm delighted that I kept working. The most profitable year I had was two years after I'd left the BBC and TV-am, and nobody knew I was even on television. I was doing all kinds of crap, but it was highly paid crap, and I was rather proud of that.\" </p> <p>For all that, he certainly wasn't happy - and the drinking was an expression of his disillusionment. \"It was a phase I went through and I can look back at it now and see all the reasons why it happened - TV-am had gone, mid-life crisis, all that crap.\" He still likes a drink but it is now firmly under control. \"I couldn't work like I do now if I was drinking too much.\" </p> <p>Parkinson is known principally for his TV work - not just his show but his high-profile anchorman roles. He was the only cool head amid the wreckage of the BBC's millennium coverage, and in a couple of weeks will pop up as host (the word fits him like a glove) of A Night of 1,000 Shows, a celebration of the 40th anniversary of BBC Television Centre. Yet he sees himself principally as a journalist - he writes a weekly sports column for the Daily Telegraph - and reckons that gives him a substance that today's generation of TV presenters lack. </p> <p>\"I've always been a print journalist and I could make a living as a print journalist, so I've never had that fear about what would happen if TV didn't come calling. That's terribly important. If they said tomorrow 'We never want to see your face on television again', it wouldn't matter a damn. I could still make a living and I'd probably write a book about how crazy they all were on TV, all my secrets. </p> <p>\"In the early days of TV, presenters were recruited from journalism: we'd had a life outside television and we brought to television an approach to whatever we did that was journalistic. Now anybody is a celebrity, anybody is a presenter. Where do they come from? What are they? They don't know themselves, poor buggers. They are put on by cynical producers and away they go. The tabloids pick them up and producers say 'What shall we do with them? I know, give them a talk show; it's easy, a talk show.' But it's not easy, as people have demonstrated for many years. Why is Boot Hill so full of these people?\" </p> <p>Parkinson is a survivor. His show has survived. His marriage, to teacher-turned-broadcaster Mary, has survived. His popularity has survived the shifts in public taste. He has never tried to change and probably wouldn't know how: he is a pretty unreconstructed northern male of a certain vintage who has no truck with political correctness and thinks Bernard Manning is uproariously funny. His attitudes seem out of place in our happy-clappy, all-inclusive, trans-gender times, yet he remains a star, the bedrock of the Beeb. How does he do it? </p> <p>\"I've always taken the view that you should keep on working. I've worked for every newspaper in the business; I've also worked for most television and radio stations. My view is don't be posh about it, keep working, because in the end things will work out. It's the Michael Caine view of film-making: there'll be a lot of rubbish but one or two things will remind you what you came into the business for. </p> <p>\"If you've got any sense, you are what you area: you're still the person from where you came. The great problem with celebrity is that it can change you, but fortunately it happened to me when I was a mature man. I was 35 and had had a career in Fleet Street and as a producer, so I understood what was happening. If it had happened to me when I was 21, I don't think you'd be interviewing me today.\"</p>",
  "<p>The International Monetary Fund and the other institutions in charge of the global economy are \"fossils from a pre-democratic era\" and have sidelined the United Nations, according to a new report published today on the eve of a key summit on the UN's future. </p> <p>Global economic problems, like the financial crisis which rocked Asia three years ago and the failure to deal with poverty are the result of a huge democratic deficit in the world economy, according to the New Economics Foundation.</p> <p>The world's seven leading industrialised economies control almost half the votes on the IMF's board because they are its biggest shareholders, a division of power which NEF describes as corruption at the highest level.</p> <p>\"If you tried to buy votes in a national election it would be gerrymandering and you could go to prison,\" said Andrew Simms, co-author of the report and head of the global economy programme at NEF. \"But buying votes at the World Bank and IMF is considered a virtue.\" The economies of most developing countries are effectively run by the IMF - as a condition of its lending programme it requires countries to stick to a detailed programme of economic policies - yet the developing world controls just over a third of votes on the IMF's board.</p> <p>\"They are 17th-century parodies of representative government,\" the report says, \"from a time that recognised only the rights of aristocrats and big landowners.\"</p> <p>The UN, the most democratic institution in the global system, has been squeezed out of its original mission to balance the interests of rich and poor countries by the IMF and the World Bank, according to NEF.</p> <p>The solution is for the Bank and the IMF to apply the same requirements of democracy and accountability they expect from developing countries to their own organisations.</p> <p>\"We have to end the minority rule of the global economy by an aristocratic economic elite,\" said Mr Simms.</p>",
  "<p>Peter Salmon confessed to friends last week that he'd had a \"terrible Edinburgh\". Even before the annual television industry love-in, the BBC1 controller knew that his time was up. Nothing was said publicly, but it did not take everyone else long to work it out for themselves. </p> <p>The evidence was all there. First, in his MacTaggart lecture, director-general Greg Dyke laid into BBC1, saying it simply had to do better. Then, the following day, he attacked the use of soap stars in poor TV dramas (think Harbour Lights and Sunburn) and called time on tired old docusoaps. Next, it was his trusted lieutenant Mark Thompson, and not Salmon, who fielded questions about how BBC1 would take shape after the Nine O'Clock News is moved to 10pm. Finally, Salmon pulled out of a seminar on TV drama, at which he was to be a panelist. </p> <p>Whispers soon made it into print: both the Daily Mail and the Guardian ran stories saying Salmon's reign was over. There were no denials from the BBC, and the controller hurried back from a brief post-festival Scottish tour - he had gone to check out filming of Monarch of the Glen and Castaway - for a series of meetings with his bosses in London. It is not a question of if, but when - and it is certain that he'll be off to another top BBC job before the month is out. </p> <p>Whoever succeeds Salmon as head of the prime public service channel on British television will be taking on a task that will either be the pinnacle of their career, or turn them into a nervous wreck. </p> <p>The controller of BBC1 has the hardest task in television: balancing the BBC's public service obligation with the drive for high ratings. Some would argue that without a mass-appeal channel, the justification for the licence fee goes out of the window and the future of the entire organisation as it is currently constituted is undermined. </p> <p>It's not a new phenomenon: Bill Cotton, the legendary former managing director of BBC Television and BBC1 controller between 1977 and 1981, says it was ever thus. \"BBC1 has always been a vital part of the BBC's claim to a licence fee. One liked to think it was the quintessential part of the BBC, that tried to do the best of everything for everybody.\" The only difference is that for Cotton, there was only one enemy - ITV - now, in the digital age, there are dozens. </p> <p>Jonathan Powell, BBC1 controller between 1987 and 1992 and now head of drama at Carlton, agrees. \"You live and die by the ratings. That's what every controller of BBC1 has always known.\" It is an almost impossible task, carrying the torch for public service broadcasting while attempting to avoid being walked all over by the opposition, he says. \"That's why it's so difficult.\" </p> <p>Dyke's task is to arrest the decline at BBC1 and boost its share in relation to its main rivals. Indeed, some suggest privately that, at the end of his term, Dyke wants to be able to claim that BBC1 is more popular than ITV. If he achieves this aim, he will be credited as the saviour of the corporation. </p> <p>The standard Salmon defence is that he has done a \"fantastic job at the most difficult time\". There was no money available to invest in popular drama, the broadcast and production divisions were split, leaving him without a support structure, and yet he pulled off successes like Walking With Dinosaurs, Warriors and the Royle Family. He saw off Noel Edmonds, became the first BBC1 controller forced to schedule against the FA Cup, and with new investment has laid the foundations for his successor. </p> <p>The case for the prosecution is that Dinosaurs wasn't his commission, Warriors was a one-off, and the Royle Family can hardly be claimed by the BBC, since it is made by Granada. On top of that, there is no new returning drama to speak of. Casualty and EastEnders were all on the scene before he came along, Holby City was already in the pipeline and the jury is still out on Monarch of the Glen. </p> <p>\"You can't say it's all Salmon's fault. John Birt has a lot to answer for,\" says Powell. \"Nobody would have succeeded under John Birt's regime. He was responsible for reducing costs so far that people had nowhere to go. That's why Peter was forced into relying on documentary soaps, they were cheap and they were the only thing he could do.\" </p> <p>Michael Jackson, chief executive of Channel 4 and BBC1 controller between 1996 and 1997, agrees it was hard for Salmon. \"The BBC collectively asked him to be distinctive, and at the same time get a 30% share. That was impossible.\" </p> <p>But could he have succeeded had the dead hand of Birt not lingered above? The Salmon regime is littered with battles he should have won, but which he lost. When the BBC was agonising over the relaunch of the Six O'Clock News, Salmon wanted Jill Dando to anchor it. He was right: she was by far the most popular BBC presenter. But Tony Hall, the head of news, preferred political correspondent Huw Edwards, and Salmon lost. He wanted rid of Panorama: it's still there, a black hole in his weekly schedule. He wanted \u00a3100m more to invest in popular drama: he's got it now, but he's not going to be spending it. </p> <p>Despite her lack of drama experience, the cheques will almost certainly be signed off by Lorraine Heggessey - currently joint director of factual and learning - as long as the unfeasibly complex drama commissioning structure proposed by Thompson is sorted out. As Cotton says when asked how he ensured the return of dozens of popular series: \"You had a good head of drama and that was his job.\" </p> <p>At the moment, the BBC doesn't really have a head of drama. There's Jane Tranter, head of drama serials, and Mal Young, head of drama series. They are the Upstairs, Downstairs of BBC drama - she muses over Wives and Daughters and Other People's Children, while he gets his hands dirty with Casualty and Holby City. Soon there will be Simon Lewis and Sue Hogg from Granada, installed as executive producers in a new unit reporting to drama and entertainment supremo Alan Yentob. </p> <p>But are these really the right people? Lewis and Hogg were unpopular figures at Granada. It is understood that Granada's programming director Grant Mansfield got so fed up with their prevarication that he told them both to \"shove off\" to the BBC if they really wanted to. Granada is now looking forward to restructuring its drama department without them. </p> <p>Crucially, ITV's revered drama controller Nick Elliott doesn't seem to be in too much of a hurry to give up his network centre kingdom, despite desperate attempts by the BBC to get him. </p> <p>Meanwhile, it is clear that the lion's share of the \u00a395m of new money earmarked by Dyke for BBC1 is going on popular drama. At BBC Elstree this week, 30 new episodes of Holby City, the Casualty spin-off, are in production. That's twice last year's run, and takes it to Peak Practice proportions, becoming almost a year-round feature of our screens. The show will gain a new children's ward, allowing writers to diversify from heart surgery to saving babies (remember the audience demographics: at 8pm, it's mums, teens and kids after EastEnders). </p> <p>Talking of which, the soap has just introduced a new family to the Square, whose five mouthy daughters will provide a raft of new storylines. That long-promised fourth episode is now certain, and if the BBC has any sense it will play it on Sunday nights, its weak point, giving Heartbeat a serious run for its money and teeing up the audience for the later-night offerings. And in Birmingham, producers are labouring on an order for 100 new half-hours of Doctors, the successful daytime soap set in a Midlands surgery. </p> <p>Series such as Holby are what the BBC really needs, the fresh but reliable mid-week regular drama that ITV is best at. As Dyke said in his MacTaggart: \"It's the programmes, stupid\". </p> <p>Young, perched in a hospital chair on the Holby set, underscores its significance. This is the first successful new BBC1 one-hour drama format and it has risen above the very public failures of Harbour Lights and Sunburn - slapped down by Dyke in Edinburgh for relying on ex-soap stars. The man who once vowed he would use former soap stars above all others is repentant. \"We're all guilty of grabbing a face, but it's a short-term gimmick. Viewers see right through it. It's the scripts that count. On the other hand, the soaps are so prevalent it's hard to find someone who hasn't been in one,\" says Young equably. </p> <p>Salmon remarked at Edinburgh, perhaps prophetically, that BBC1 can be a very cold place. He meant that there would have to be more collaboration, between the network of five new channels sketched out by Dyke, so promising ideas can migrate across. </p> <p> However, in the short term, the stockpiling for next year's schedule blitz started under him six months ago, as the shift in 9pm news was anticipated. The build up in production has been aided, confirms Dyke, by a cache of \u00a3200m, amassed by prudent BBC accountants, before the improved licence fee settlement was struck last January. </p> <p>So, there are three more Scarlet Pimpernels, starring Richard E Grant. Martin Shaw, a hit in ITV's rival hospital drama, Always and Everyone, has been wooed to star in Judge John Dee, a series about an unconventional judge, written by GF Newman (Law and Order). And Stephen Tompkinson is being paired with Nick Berry for In Deep, an undercover cop show, for post watershed. It could become the regular police drama that the BBC so badly needs. </p> <p>BBC1 is investing in Steven Spielberg's 10-part Band of Brothers, about a group of American soldiers in the second world war, a spin-off from Saving Private Ryan, currently in production in Hertfordshire. </p> <p>It's clear, then, that Dyke has signed up BBC1 to the Bill Cotton rule of \"being the best of everyone for everybody\". The question is, whether he's got the right idea. Is there enough talent simply to make all these programmes? Jackson thinks not. \"That's a huge undertaking and it's a waste of time. You just need to make sure that BBC1 is out there, making a few big hits that make people say 'thank God for the BBC'. Anything else is just too difficult.\" </p> <p><strong>ITV is in trouble too</strong><br>by David Elstein</p> <p>Why does it matter where the BBC places its main evening news bulletin? Before Greg Dyke labels me as one of the \"retired old men of the BBC\" defending yesterday (yes, I did work there until 35 years ago), I do not believe 9pm is sacrosanct or 10pm impermissible. But I do believe in being honest with the public. </p> <p>The argument based on Commons votes or US markets closing is simply laughable. Dyke himself scoffed at it while making the case for moving News at Ten to Gerald Kaufman's Commons committee when he was ITV's council chairman. Very few Commons votes feature in the news, let alone those at 10pm. The US markets have all but closed when the present 9pm bulletin ends, and virtually never merit more than a glancing mention. </p> <p>But \"the main reason\" for the move, according to Dyke, is that more people will watch news in the later slot. That is barely credible. There are far fewer people available to view television at 10pm than 9pm. A later bulletin might - \"might!\" - just win a larger share of available viewers, but that \"more people will watch it\" is a pledge almost impossible to fulfil. Will the governors require a return to 9pm if the ploy fails? Don't hold your breath. </p> <p>Dyke made much of the claim that \"currently in digital homes, audience share for the Nine O'Clock News often falls below 10%\". In fact, after under-performing against the rest of the schedule for the first six months of the year in digital satellite homes, the Nine O'Clock News has since equalled or out-performed BBC1 as a whole in these homes, based on the relative share of viewing compared with total viewing. </p> <p>In any case, there is absolutely no evidence that news will perform any better relatively in digital homes at 10pm than at 9pm. And we have heard before all these improbable protestations about enlarging the news audience by moving the bulletin later - from the ITV companies. Nobody (except, perhaps, an over-credulous ITC) believed them: but then the transparent motive for the move was to increase audience share in the vacated slot. </p> <p>Increasing BBC1's audience share at 9pm is evidently the true motive for moving the news, and Greg should have been much more straightforward about it. After all, it is all part of the pressure that licence-fee funding places on the BBC. You cannot afford to let the audience share for your main channel drop to the point where licence-fee payers feel short-changed, and evasion starts to rise again. </p> <p>Of course, what takes the 9pm slot remains a crucial issue. First, will it drive up audience share? The evidence from the run of failed dramas at 9.30pm recently would suggest that the BBC simply lacks the fire power to compete at 9pm, unless there is to be a shift to much more populist programming. That in turn raises the issue of why a publicly-funded broadcaster should deliberately reduce the news audience in peak-time (as seems inevitable) in favour of increasing consumption of soft factual material or entertainment. A major dent in the BBC's reputation for public service broadcasting seems a high price to pay for putting a minor blip in the ratings decline of BBC1. </p> <p>Whether Lorraine Heggessey (if it is to be her) can achieve what eluded Peter Salmon must be doubtful. Three years of navigating the BBC's frustrating system seems to have crushed some of Salmon's natural flair: at Edinburgh, he made a woeful hash of the ITV line-up in the scheduling game, putting both a 90-minute Bill and Burnside into peak-time, while BBC exile Michael Attwell showed how a competitive BBC1 schedule could be assembled. Heggessey - whom I have known since she was a student - is an energetic go-getter, but she (like Salmon) will lack the full control of the channel budget and commissioning process that is so essential in a competitive environment. </p> <p>In any event, the downward trend for the two main channels seems inexorable. In 1989, ITV and BBC1 captured 80% of all viewers. In 1995, 70%. In 1999, just under 60%. So far this year, 56.5%. For the last month, less than 53%. In multi-channel homes in July, they shared barely 40% of the audience, for the first time less than all satellite channels combined. If anything, BBC1's plight has only served to conceal ITV's dismal performance, not just across the day, but even within its own carefully defined version of peak-time, where it will fail by a wide margin even to meet the target it so recently revised sharply downward. Of course, ITV's concentration of ownership allows it to secure a disproportionate amount of the advertising market, despite audience erosion. The licence fee is not like that. Dyke (and Heggessey) may find that the news manoeuvre backfires. A further audience decline, embracing an even sharper news audience decline, would leave a lot of questions to be answered at Edinburgh next year.</p>",

So we end up working weekends and nights,\" Bjurman says.</p>",
  "<p>The firework artificers of the Stade de France were already priming the fuses for their spectacular post-match display when, in the 80th minute of Saturday night's game, the slight figure in the unfamiliar No16 shirt stepped across the touchline and on to the field of play. </p> <p>By that juncture, for all England's pleasing contribution to an engrossingly combative and eventful match, France should have wrapped it up with a hatful of goals and sent Laurent Blanc, Didier Deschamps and Bernard Lama into international retirement on the back of a valedictory win to go with the bouquets and party bags they received before the kick-off. But for Michael Owen, there were 10 minutes still available in which to use someone else's fete to make his personal point. </p> <p>Owen is too cool and too shrewd to let us know what he thinks of Kevin Keegan's consistent refusal to endorse the opinion of the rest of the world, which is that the Liverpool striker is one of very, very few Englishmen entitled to call themselves world-class players. Perhaps, as a former Liverpool striker himself, the England coach is unable to view the 20-year-old's talent without prejudice, much as Glenn Hoddle's own past seemed to obscure his judgment of the similarly gifted David Beckham - a common and perfectly understandable human trait, but one that needs as much corrective attention in a football manager as it would in a military officer. </p> <p>Keegan's decision to take a look at Andy Cole and Paul Scholes working together was a perfectly reasonable notion, particularly in the light of the posting to central midfield of David Beckham, their club colleague. But having taken the decision, Keegan really should have made it his business to ensure the world understood that this did not entail a demotion of Owen. Instead Keegan allowed it to seem like a slight, in succession to those delivered during Euro 2000, when he made it clear time and again that Owen was not worth trusting over the whole 90 minutes. </p> <p>Owen wisely kept his own counsel, but his eventual riposte could hardly have been more conclusive. Either side of the decisive moment, he scarcely got a touch. But when Beckham and Steve McManaman built a move that brought the ball across the France penalty area from left to right, and when Kieron Dyer exploited the momentary absence of Bixente Lizarazu to dart down into the gap and slip a lethal cross into the goalmouth, there was Owen, anticipating the ball's path and arriving a yard in front of Frank Leboeuf before turning a magnificent volley - the perfect product of instinct and technique - past the previously impregnable Lama. </p> <p>There can be no doubt now, even in Keegan's mind, about which Englishman is more likely to score international goals. Beckham? One goal in 35 appearances. Cole? None in eight. Emile Heskey? One in nine. Scholes, of course, has 10 in 28, including two hat-tricks, but he is a supporting player, not a chief striker. And Owen is the only one who ever looks likely to get you a goal out of nothing, as he did against Brazil in May. </p> <p>Not that the Beckham-Scholes-Cole axis did badly on Saturday night, considering they were up against the world and European champions, and a four-man defence that had never been beaten as a unit and, in their last appearance together, had no intention of surrendering that proud record. England's approach play in the first half was fully the equal of France's, and their chances were the more clear-cut, although it has to be remembered that several key members of the home team have yet to begin their league seasons in Italy and Spain, and were clearly lacking the final competitive edge. </p> <p>Yet the match itself had plenty of edge, in the sense that every player seemed aware of the fact that pride, individual and collective, was at stake. No doubt the recent influx of French players into the English league - and out again, trailing clouds of acrimony, in two or three cases - has added an extra dimension to the fixture, and there was more than enough harshness in the challenges to remove it entirely from the realm of meaningless friendlies. </p> <p>Not unexpectedly, it was Dennis Wise wot started it, catching Zinedine Zidane on the side of the head inside the first minute. Just over an hour later Zidane took his revenge, barely bothering to glance at the resulting yellow card as he trotted away from the Chelsea man's prone form. Barely a minute later he had both made France's goal with a typically simple and lethal square pass to Emmanuel Petit, and left the pitch, replaced by Robert Pires. </p> <p>Job done, or almost. In fact Pires finished it off, in one sense, catching Wise with such a spiteful foul two minutes into injury-time that the Chelsea man had to be carried into the dressing room, which will probably ensure Arsenal's new recruit a warm welcome when he turns out at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday night - although Pires himself was quoted in a French magazine last week as saying that while there is a lot of fighting and fouling in the English game, at least it's all forgotten with a handshake once the final whistle goes. </p> <p>England will be pleased with their draw, but in the second half there were long periods when France played them off the park. A wonderfully spirited display from Thierry Henry and a dashing 45 minutes from Sylvain Wiltord should have produced more goals and, in a truly competitive environment, with no unforced substitutions, there could have been only one set of winners. But on a night on which an excellent game of football took second place to a set of emotional farewells, the home players were already tasting the champagne when Owen nipped in to end the contest, if not the celebrations, on a proper note of realism.</p>",
  "<p>The poor old euro cuts a sorry figure as it stumbles around the foreign exchanges. Interest rates have risen five times already this year, and will rise again during the autumn, but still investors would prefer to hold US dollars than the single currency. The European Central Bank appears to be at its wits' end, with one half of the markets decrying last week's move as too aggressive and the other half arguing that it was not aggressive enough. </p> <p>With Germany and France showing the first signs of slowing down while inflation in Ireland is out of control, the strains in monetary union are showing for the first time since the euro was launched 20 months ago. For months, Europe's central bankers and politicians have been saying that the euro is fundamentally undervalued and will soon deliver a knockout blow to the over-confident dollar. But, somehow, it never seems to happen. Capital is still flowing into the US and out of Europe, and it is this rather than the counterpart, Europe's trade surplus and America's trade deficit, that is affecting currency values. </p> <p>Two of the UK groups that oppose monetary union, Business for Sterling and New Europe, today launch a campaign designed to point out the benefits of staying out and the risks of going in, and they could hardly have picked a more propitious moment to do so. Talking up the euro hasn't worked, higher interest rates haven't worked, massive G7 intervention is not on the agenda because the Democrats are relying on the strong dollar to damp down US inflation, underpin share prices on Wall Street and ensure that the planned slowdown in American growth does not turn into a hard landing. </p> <p>So what is to be done? One long-term answer could be to put the euro out of its misery altogether and decide that monetary union in Europe is merely a stepping stone to global monetary union with the dollar as the single currency. Inadvertently perhaps, the justification for such a move was provided by a recent pamphlet produced by Britain in Europe, the lobby group that favours sterling's entry into the single currency. </p> <p>The report, quite fairly, does not pretend that euroland has a better job creation record than the UK (which it does not) and concedes that there are risks involved in both joining the euro and in staying out. But, interestingly, the reasons that it says tip the balance in its favour - the ability of businesses to sell more widely, achieving the \"massive economies of scale seen in America\", removing the barriers to trade represented by \"separate currencies\", limiting currency fluctuations, and having greater influence in decision-making would all seem to be arguments in favour of one world currency. </p> <p>If the name of the game is removing barriers then why stop at Europe? The inexorable logic of the BiE report is that making life easier for business will lead to higher growth and hence all of us will reap the trickle-down benefits of higher living standards. So, in classic Thatcherite fashion, the more barriers that can be removed the better, and given that more than 60% of world trade and inward investment are between North America, Western Europe and Japan, this ought to mean just one big currency. Indeed, two of the people responsible for the BiE paper, Robert Mundell and Willem Buiter, are supporters of a world currency. </p> <p>Would there be advantages to this, in addition to the obvious benefit to those in the euro zone of having Alan Greenspan and the Federal Reserve in charge of monetary policy rather than the hapless ECB? Well, it would put an end to currency speculation. Yoked together by a single currency, governments in the rich countries could settle their differences and push for a new trade round to remove any other barriers to business that threaten the ability of their multinationals to prise open new markets. </p> <p>Moreover, technically speaking, this would be the perfect moment to amalgamate the three major currencies into one. Give or take a few cents, one dollar buys one euro buys 100 yen. Rebase the yen so that 100 old yen equals one new yen and the three currencies would all trade at close to parity. </p> <p> Given the premise of the BiE paper, this makes as much sense as British membership of the euro, and is subject to the same two objections. The first is economic: the fact that the right monetary policy for the US at the present would certainly not be the right monetary policy for Japan, just as the monetary policy that is right for Germany is not right for Ireland. </p> <p><strong> Tower of Babel</strong><br> Had Britain joined monetary union in 1999 and cut interest rates to 3%, it is clear that inflation would now be well above its 2.5% target and the government would be under considerable pressure to tighten fiscal policy to counterbalance the monetary laxity. Ireland, with inflation above 6%, has negative real interest rates, which is totally inappropriate. </p> <p>The second is political: the reluctance of people to give up democratic rights even if that does involve accepting a degree of inefficiency. Europe is a case in point, here. All EU documents are published in 11 languages, and this requires non-stop work for 1,900 translators working in the appropriately named Tower of Babel in Brussels. In terms of economic efficiency, it would make far better sense to have one language. But were it to be said that Europe needed one language as well as one money there would be outrage, and rightly so. Language is not just about making money, but is a part of culture and an individual right. It cannot be bargained away to improve profitability. </p> <p>Inadvertently perhaps, the BiE report lets the cat out of the bag. Monetary union is not there to create a European redoubt against the Americanisation of the global economy, but to give succour to all those intent on dismantling the European social model. This is a problem for the Little Europeans who hope vainly that monetary union is a device for keeping the nasty Americans at bay, and see British entry into monetary union as the only way to safeguard Europe's identity. </p> <p>The government certainly does not see it this way. As far as can be determined from its delphic pronouncements, Labour is with the globalisers not the Uncle Sam bashers, buying the argument from its big business chums that monetary union will help to make Europe more dynamic (more profits for business) and flexible (fewer benefits for workers). Unfortunately, the government is allowed to get away with the pretence that there is something progressive about this because William Hague keeps insisting that monetary union is a socialist plot. If only. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:larry.elliott@theguardian.com\">larry.elliott@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "It is an admission which I make with some embarrassment but, confession being good for the soul, I reveal that, during the last few days, my thoughts have constantly turned to John Redwood. My aberrant behaviour began in the middle of last week, shortly after listening to a discussion on the Today programme. The topic was David Howell's new book on the politics of the global economy. The author's own contribution was, as you would expect, highly intelligent but totally uninspired. The international market had, he said, reduced politicians' ability to control national economies. They should, he argued, accept that truth and, instead of claiming powers which they do not possess, concentrate on creating a climate in which the people they represent gain most from the new reality. <p>That proposition is so difficult to deny that, at first, I wondered what Mr Redwood - invited onto the programme to stimulate some kind of discussion - would say, in addition to \"Quite right\". I should have guessed. First he denounced the government for damaging small businesses. Then he attacked the EU for imposing unnecessary burdens on companies of every size. Lord Howell had spoken in the language of the corporate seminar. Mr Redwood sounded like a bar-parlour Young Conservative. I have no doubt that diehard Tories who were listening loved every cliche. </p> <p>I attributed my surprise at Mr Redwood's conduct to the early hour in which the discussion took place. Had I been fully awake I would have remembered that he always behaves in the same way. During an Any Questions? broadcast in July, he was asked his opinion about the prosecution of the headmistress who was accused (and eventually acquitted) of striking one of the children in her school. He answered that New Labour encouraged an environment in which \"the wrong people get punished\". </p> <p>Earlier in the year, when we appeared together on a television programme called Powerhouse, I so despaired of provoking him into serious discussion that I spent my time drawing attention to his talent for repeating hackneyed slogans as if they were revelations of a previous unrecognised truth. If he were to make a guest appearance on Coronation Street, Mr Redwood would explain to Natalie that Les Battersby is the product of socialist-induced dependency culture. </p> <p>Mr Redwood is, we are constantly assured, a man of formidable intellect - Fellow of All Souls, merchant banking infant prodigy and head of Margaret Thatcher's policy unit. Somewhere along the way he must have been told - and shown the opinion polls to prove - that there is nothing floating voters like less than political point scoring. They disapprove of it even during overtly political debate. When party points are made during discussion of apparently unpolitical topics, they are instantly alienated from whoever made them and the cause which he or she supports. The voters the Tories must win if they are ever to form a government admire brave Doctor Mowlam and amiable Mr Steven Norris - two politicians who are thought to be above politics. Why does Mr Redwood antagonise potential support which is essential to Conservative success? </p> <p>I put aside, at once, the thought that Mr Redwood actually wants a Conservative defeat. And I discard - with almost equal certainty - the possibility that, confronted with camera or microphone, he is engulfed in a red mist which prevents him from behaving with rational calm. There is, in fact, only one plausible explanation. He knows that his party is doomed and believes it his duty to enthuse the hard core of Conservative voters who enjoy the party sniping which normal people detest. Whether he courts the diminishing band of loyalists on his own, or his party's, behalf will only be clear when the defeat which he anticipates comes about. </p> <p>The one thing to be said in favour of the Redwood broadcasting style is that it is based on a strategy - a suicidal strategy, but a strategy nevertheless. So it is just possible to argue that his behaviour, although ridiculous, is more grown-up than attempts to attract support by boasting about teenage drinking exploits and identifying ex-girlfriends. But both weird Tory campaigning techniques have one thing in common. They are the product of despair. </p> <p>The problem of the Redwood approach - at least for the Tories - is that, because it anticipates defeat at the next election, it makes defeat more certain at the one which follows. The people who wave union flags in time to Rule Britannia after the Tory leader finishes his address to party conference are, let us give thanks, not typical of the British public. Behaviour which appeals to them, antagonises floating voters. John Redwood must know it. Yet, because of inner compulsion or convoluted calculation, he continues to offend the people the Conservatives need most. For Labour, the more often he broadcasts, the better. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "Al Gore has made fewer campaign commitments than George W Bush on foreign affairs and defence, but then few American elections have been won and lost on foreign policy. <p>Mr Gore served in the US army in Vietnam from 1969 to 1971, though he was opposed to the war. Those years give him a credibility with the defence establishment which Bill Clinton never achieved. So also do his years in the Senate, in which he gained the reputation of a conscientious independent thinker on issues such as arms control. </p> <p>As America's commander-in-chief, he would not be so self-evidently a client of the military-industrial establishment as any Republican president - and certainly Mr Bush - would be. But Mr Gore is a defence hawk, and might favour more aggressive US military stances against opponents such as Iraq. </p> <p>Last month, after Mr Bush said in his Philadelphia nomination speech that US forces were demoralised, under-resourced and, in some cases, unready for action, Mr Gore mounted a fierce counter-attack, accusing Mr Bush of seeking to \"run down America's military for political advantage\". This seems to have discouraged further Republican efforts to make defence a major campaign issue. </p> <p>Mr Gore's position on the National Missile Defence System (NMD) is ambiguous. Officially, he supports the Clinton administration's plan to deploy a limited battery of interceptor missiles, and he has deliberately not attacked Mr Bush for his more ambitious views on the issue. But he is a proven believer in international arms control, and if he wanted to put the NMD issue on hold after he was elected he could do so, and would collect international acclaim for it. </p> <p>A Gore administration would have the traditional close relations with Europe, but the vice-president does not have the sentimental attachments to England or Ireland which made Bill Clinton a close ally of Tony Blair. </p> <p>He is probably closer to the Israel lobby than any Democratic presidential candidate in modern times, not least because of Mr Lieberman's presence on the ticket. </p> <p>European diplomats expect that a Gore administration would be tougher than Clinton's on trade issues. </p> <p>Mr Gore advocates free trade and the authority to negotiate fast-track trade agreements, but he has hinted at limits to free trade which would set him apart from Mr Bush. </p> <p>\"We must set standards to end child labour, to prevent the exploitation of workers, and the poisoning of the environment,\" he said last month. In the end, of course, it depends on what those standards are.</p>",
  "With the announcement that he is not going ahead with national missile defence (NMD), Bill Clinton did two immensely welcome things. He made the world a safer place, at least for the five months until his successor takes over and possibly for longer if his action has strengthened his vice-president, Al Gore. For he has given the electors of the United States further evidence that Bush and Gore do differ. Mr Gore's response to the president's statement was warm, welcoming the chance to take stock. So a gulf opened between him and his Republican opponent: a vote for George W Bush in November thus becomes a vote to destabilise international relations, to squander American treasure and to enhance a sense of magical emancipation from the world's troubles that can only, given the global asymmetry of economic and military might, be dangerous for us all. <p>Mr Clinton's hand was forced by technology. The \"hit-to-kill\" interceptor rockets fired in South Pacific tests failed to connect. Will they ever? Mr Clinton said deferment would not necessarily affect eventual deployment. But he must know the cost-benefit case for NMD has been weakened. Even Star Wars-weaned Americans can see that unless NMD offers 100% security it is worthless; yet the cost of attaining 100% could be infinitely greater than reaching even 90%-plus. </p> <p>In the circumstances he did what a lame duck president had to do - kick the dossier into his successor's in-tray. But Mr Clinton's role does not end there. He understands, as the Republican contender cannot or will not, that NMD offers nothing towards the long-run accommodation the United States must make with China. There is a \"rogue state\" problem but it is inseparable from the large question of American engagement with regional theatres of conflict, in the Middle East as in east Asia. Because he has superior understanding Mr Clinton must use the next few months to educate his fellow countrypeople, for example about NMD's dangers for the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. This entails an active role in the election campaign. Who else is equipped to explain just why the Texas governor's glib offer to extend NMD to Europe and the Middle East is ridiculous? To call differences between Democrats and Republicans life and death is hyperbolic - Mr Gore affirms he still wants some kind of missile system. But after the president's wise deferral, the choice is much clearer cut.</p>",
  "Nestling deep in the sun belt of the south, Austin is booming.

Since he became governor, 1m new jobs and almost 50,000 new businesses have been created. </p> <p>However, as with the US economy as a whole, there is another side to the story. Texas may be one of the handful of states not to levy its own income tax in addition to the federal income tax, but it has also seen a marked increase in inequality and poverty under Mr Bush. </p> <p>In 1990 it was ranked by the census bureau as the eighth poorest state; the latest figures show that it is now the fifth poorest, with only Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico and West Virginia ranked lower. </p> <p>Mr Bush's supporters argue that he has made a success of welfare-to-work policies; critics say that the emphasis on pushing people into low-paid jobs has left education and training neglected. Despite the presence of world-beating companies such as Dell, Texas produces fewer scientists and engineers than the average state, and ranks 48th in basic literacy. </p> <p>One of Mr Bush's main policies in the election is his tax-cutting plan to help ordinary working families, working mothers and other low-income Americans. </p> <p>The Democrats say that the governor's record in his home state has been one of failure, leaving low-income Texans worse off than working families in other states. </p> <p>In 1998 Texas ranked 50th -last - in the union for women without health insurance and 43rd for women living in poverty. Almost 18% of Texan working parents had low earnings - defined as too meagre to lift a family of four out of poverty despite full time work - and Texas ranks third in the US in hunger. </p> <p>The environmental impact of Mr Bush's economic policies are likely to become a campaign issue. </p> <p>Houston has become the smog capital of the US, and the Republican presidential candidate has removed restrictions on development in Texas, opposes any curbs on trade in genetically modified food, and would completely repudiate the aims of the Kyoto climate agreement. </p> <p><br><b>Texas facts :</b></p> <p>\u0095 Unemployment rate 4.5% </p> <p>\u0095 48,000 new businesses created under Bush </p> <p>\u0095 Almost \u00a33bn in tax cuts </p> <p>\u0095 Fifth largest proportion in US of population living in poverty </p> <p>\u0095 25%of Texan children (1.4m) lack health insurance</p>",
  "I must protest at George Monbiot's article (Getting into bed with big business, August 31). To our knowledge, never has any president of the general assembly or any UN secretariat official ever announced that business would be given a formal role in UN decision-making. The idea is preposterous. <p>The secretary-general did not launch the Business Humanitarian Forum, it is a business NGO; nor has he ever attended any of its meetings; nor is it co-chaired by the UN high commissioner for refugees. </p> <p>The UN development programme project referred to did not include Nike or Shell, and no logo was developed for it. </p> <p>The secretary-general's Global Compact, which is intended to identify and promote good corporate practices in the areas of human rights, labour standards and the environment, is an equal partnership among business, organised labour and NG0s - not merely a UN-business partnership. The partners in the compact are no more entitled to use of the UN's logo than anyone else. </p> <p>Relatively few of the corporate partners in the Global Compact could be described as \"most controversial corporations\" (the list is posted on our website, <a href=\"http://www.unglobalcompact.org\" target=\"_NEW\">www.unglobalcompact.org</a>) But surely the idea is not that we should limit our efforts to promote good practices by working only with companies that have spotless records. What would be the point? </p> <p>Readers of the Guardian deserve better commentaries than they have got from Mr Monbiot - and so, too, does the United Nations.</p> <p><b>John G Ruggie</b> <br>Assistant secretary-general, <br>UN information centre, London</p>",
  "Al Gore has never uttered a more important sentence than the one which came just minutes into his presidential nomination acceptance speech at the Democratic convention in Los Angeles last month. <p>\"I stand here tonight as my own man,\" Mr Gore told the delegates, \"and I want you to know me for who I truly am.\" </p> <p>After two terms as Bill Clinton's vice-president, the 52-year-old Al Gore is now two months away from becoming only the third man in American history to win the presidency at the end of an eight-year apprenticeship in the deputy's job. </p> <p>If he is to emulate Martin Van Buren and George Bush Sr, Mr Gore faces three tasks. He must define himself as his own man. He must tell America - and the world - what a Gore presidency would be like. And he must win an election which, until recently, he seemed likely to lose. </p> <p>Mr Gore seemed to stumble so often in the early months of the 2000 campaign because he was failing in the first two tasks. He has seemed anonymous - an occupational hazard for any vice-president - and too calculating. His political positions have seemed to owe more to fear and focus groups than to his principles. </p> <p>His lowest point came in early summer, when George W Bush seemed to be running away with the election. Afraid of losing Florida on November 7, Gore dithered on the Elian Gonzalez question, losing more support than he won in Florida and across the US. </p> <p>A month later, fearing that a run of high-profile executions in Bush's Texas might make capital punishment, which both candidates support, into an issue, Gore froze when an interviewer asked him if he would ever authorise the execution of a pregnant woman. That week, the Green nominee Ralph Nader reached the highest position he has yet achieved in the polls. </p> <p>Since then, Gore has fought to define himself - one of his catch phrases is that he is a \"principled fighter\". </p> <p>Nothing has helped him more than selecting Joe Lieberman of Connecticut as his running mate. From the moment the Democrats' fiercest critic of Bill Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky joined the ticket, Mr Gore recovered steadily in the opinion polls. </p> <p>Like Mr Lieberman and Mr Clinton, Mr Gore has a long record of centrist politics. All three men are on the right of the Democratic party, though all would insist that they are modernisers rather than conservatives. Mr Gore's record shows he is the most traditional Democrat of the three. </p> <p>As a congressman for eight years from 1976, and as a Tennessee senator between 1984 and 1992 - positions which his father held before him - Mr Gore was a classic \"cold war liberal\". He was pro-labour on government programmes at home, tough on foreign policy abroad, and in the middle on social issues like abortion. Mr Gore's speech to the convention this year was consistent with these positions. </p> <p>As with any US politician's legislative record, there are defining moments. In 1984, Mr Gore voted for a ban on federal education funds for school districts which discriminated against school prayer groups - a mark of the Baptist faith which repeatedly surfaces in Mr Gore's self-presentation. </p> <p>That was also the year that Mr Gore broke with many Democrats by voting to keep the MX missile programme, although he later voted for a nuclear freeze resolution. In 1990, Mr Gore was again in the minority of his party in voting to keep the B2 stealth bomber programme alive. </p> <p>Probably the most significant single vote Mr Gore ever cast came in 1991, when he voted in favour of the Gulf war in the senate, joining a mainly Republican majority to support action against Iraq. Even then, Gore went into the Senate with a gap in his speech where his decision - still unmade - would come. </p> <p>During his years on Capitol Hill, he laid out some of the stances most characteristic of his agenda. He may not have invented the internet, as he once appeared to claim, but he was unquestionably the most scientifically-minded senator of his era. No one on Capitol Hill has a better perception of the potentialities and problems of innovations such as biotechnology and superconductors - and none campaigned more intensively on threats to the environment. </p> <p>Perhaps the most significant shift in his thinking over the past decade has been from universalism to targeting in benefits policies. In 1988, when he first ran for the presidency, Mr Gore was a big government man, defending the traditional rationale for non-means-tested benefits. This year, in contrast to Mr Bush, targeting and incrementalism are the central themes of his tax and benefit proposals. </p> <p>On the broad canvas, a Gore presidency would represent continuity with the Clinton years, but his tone and instincts are more populist and class-conscious than Mr Clinton's. His appeal to \"working families\" may be focus group-tested, but it corresponds to a strong theme in Mr Gore's background, and could herald a retreat from some of the more overt \"third way\" approaches of the man he hopes to succeed.</p>",
  "Joanna Hamden, 73, lives in Mayfair, central London. Nice four-bedroom flat worth at least a million, new BMW, several holidays a year. But she has lived for nearly 30 years just 50 yards from Park Lane, which the government has suggested is and will continue to be one of the most heavily polluted streets in Britain. <p>Lorries and cars fume and shriek past her double-glazed windows night and day. She is often out of breath and last week she spent two days in bed with a bad chest. </p> <p>Five miles across the choked city, James Green, 67, of north Kensington, is a former postman. Mr Green, who like Ms Hamden is a non-smoker, lives in a council flat near a busy road and for the past five years has suffered respiratory illnesses almost certainly caused by traffic. His doctor has warned him that a bad winter could be fatal. He barely goes out and is obsessive about dust. </p> <p>Ms Hamden and Mr Green, continents apart socially and economically, are equal candidates - along with hundreds of thousands of others throughout Britain who live and work in heavily traffic-polluted places - for an early grave from air pollution. </p> <p>Like other Londoners polled recently by the Kings Fund charity to discover what people believe has the greatest impact on their health, they both cite poor air quality, and specifically too much traffic. </p> <p>Last week a World Health Organisation-funded study, published in the medical journal the Lancet, confirmed their fears. It suggested that 6% of all deaths in Switzerland, France and Austria are now caused by the micro-particles known as PM10s (less than one hundredth of a millimetre in diameter) and PM2.5s (less than four hundredth of a millimetre) emitted by car exhausts, especially diesels, and industrial processes. No one doubts that a similar study in Britain, still a home to heavy industry and with some of Europe's most congested city centres, would show similar results. </p> <p>Friends of the Earth has calculated that the European study equates to 19,000 premature deaths a year from traffic pollution in Britain. It is in line with environment minister Michael Meacher's estimate of between 12,000 and 24,000 premature deaths a year from all British air pollution, including industrial. The economic costs would probabaly run into billions. </p> <p>Barry Grey, a consultant in the department of respiratory diseases at King's College hospital, London, says: \"It is suggested traffic pollution mainly affects people who already have cardio-respiratory diseases, with the inference they are less important. I think [government lack of response] is bound up with keeping the motor industry going.\" </p> <p>The official line is that traffic pollution is rapidly improving, with better petrol and engine technologies and tighter European and British standards for some pollutants like benzene, 1,3-butadiene, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide and lead. \"Traffic pollution has reduced 50% in the past 10 years and is expected to reduce a further 50% by 2010,\" a Department of the Environment spokeswoman said. </p> <p>But each new study on micro-particulates brings more bad news. Evidence is mounting worldwide that these micro-particles pose the real health problems. They are now known to escape the filtering mechanisms of the respiratory system. </p> <p>The new European study, a 1999 investigation into traffic pollution in five US cities, and other studies all associate PM10s and 2.5s with premature deaths, exacerbation of asthma, increased respiratory irritation and infections, and decreased lung function. Environment groups accuse the government of insufficiently addressing the problem. </p> <p>The DoE has welcomed the European report but plays down the importance of particulate pollution. </p> <p>Health experts like Dr Grey and environment groups like Friends of the Earth are convinced that the problem is mainly the quantity of particulates being emitted and the only way to solve it is by reducing traffic levels. And that is a political hot potato that no one wants to really pick up. </p> <p>Back in Mayfair, Ms Hamden says she will spend the winter with relatives \"well away\" fromher home. </p> <p>Mr Green has little choice but to remain in north Kensington.</p>",
  "A haze, spiked with a strong smell of sulphur, hangs in the air as you approach the belt of heavily industrialised land that runs along the eastern edge of Swansea bay. Sandwiched between the giant Port Talbot steelworks and a busy stretch of the M4 are the communities of Margam and Taibach, where air quality is among the worst in Britain. <p>Residents complain about the coloured dust that falls almost daily on their homes and cars, dirtying window ledges and washing and at times leaving a glittery sheen on the coats of their pets. </p> <p>The blast furnaces of an industry that dominates the skyline and the local economy - as it has done for almost 100 years - are cursed for their noise and smoke. But it is an invisible pollutant that places Port Talbot high in the air pollution charts. </p> <p>According to Friends of the Earth, the area was ranked second only to Marylebone Road, in central London, last year for the number of days in which the level of the microscopic particulate PM10 exceeded government accepted levels. The pressure group estimates that heavy industry accounts for around three-quarters of the problem, with much of the balance coming from road traffic. </p> <p>Neath Port Talbot council, aware of the health implications of a pollutant that can penetrate to the deepest part of the lung, has already begun drawing up a plan to tackle the problem. </p> <p>While the council has been careful not to apportion blame for the air quality problems, those living near the sprawling steelworks believe Corus, the plant's Anglo-Dutch owners, have much to do to clean up their act. </p> <p>David Rosser, 56, who returned to Margam more than 20 years ago after a spell in the army, has planted a screen of leylandii at the bottom of his garden in order to hide his industrial neighbour. But the trees have been unable to shut out the noise or the dust that coats his greenhouse. </p> <p>\"We are not Victor Meldrews,\" he said yesterday. \"All we want is a better quality of life. It would be nice to be able to sit out in the garden on a warm day, but that is absolutely impossible. And if they are sending out all this stuff that you can see, God knows what they are sending out what you can't see. </p> <p>\"It is the next generation that is of real concern. We just don't know what the effects of these pollutants are.\" His youngest daughter, now 26, had developed asthma after they moved to the house when she was a child. It had cleared up when she moved away. </p> <p>Robert David, 44, the deputy head of a local primary school, was similarly concerned. \"I've been living here all my life, apart from when I went to college, so it's probably too late for me. But I have got three little ones. I'm not saying you can take pollution away completely, but there must be a way around it.\" </p> <p>Corus said it has reduced emissions significantly over recent years. It said PM10s were not attributable solely to industry. Traffic was a major source. \"We are actively involved with the local council and the environment agency in developing a strategy to improve air quality.\"</p>"
