  "The rugged dry hills of northern Pakistan are almost 4,000 miles from the rolling dales of northern England. But if you stand at the corner of some streets in Bradford or Derby or Huddersfield they feel a lot closer. Old men, their beards dyed orange with henna, rest in the evening sunlight on their way to the mosque. Boys, in white round prayer caps and the traditional baggy trousers worn in Karachi or Peshawar, play cricket with a makeshift bat. Women pull their headscarves tight up to their eyes when a stranger walks past. <p>Rukhsana Naz grew up in streets like these. A bright, educated woman, she had been married at 16 to an older man. At 19, she was pregnant by her childhood sweetheart. Her mother told her the child was 'an insult to [her] husband'. </p> <p>When she refused an abortion and demanded a divorce, Rukhsana was invited to a family dinner where her brother, Shazad, strangled her with a skipping rope. Her mother, Shakeela, helped hold her down. Her actions had 'shamed' the family, the court was told. </p> <p>Rukhsana Naz's killers were jailed last year. In June 1995 another Pakistani girl was run down and crushed to death by her brother-in-law for a similar offence in Bradford. Tasleem Begum was 20 and had been married for four years to an older Pakistani man. She too fell in love. She too transgressed traditional codes of behaviour and brought shame on her family. </p> <p>Such killings are not rare in South Asia and the Middle East. There are 5,000 of these 'honour killings' every year across the world, according to a recent UN report 'Living Together, Worlds Apart: Men and Women in a Time of Change'. They occur both in the rural areas, where age-old traditions, value codes and modes of justice still hold sway, and in the cities, where newer tensions have sparked increasing violence towards women. Supporters say the killings maintain social order in changing times; critics allege that chauvinistic men use the 'family honour' as a pretext for punishing women who want more freedom. </p> <p>In the United Kingdom honour killings are also happening. The Observer has found that the deaths of Tasleem Begum and Rukhsana Naz fit into a broader pattern of violence against women within the South Asian community. </p> <p>Since Tasleem Begum died, nearly five years ago, there have been at least 20 other deaths in Britain that can be connected with ideas of 'honour', as well as hundreds of acts of lesser violence. Campaigners claim the honour code - and its accompanying concept of shame - is a key factor in the repression of the rights of tens of thousands of Asian women in Britain. </p> <p>Recent cases involving 'honour' in the UK include: </p> <p>\u0095 A Wakefield man axed to death by family members for continuing an affair with a younger female relative. Beheading is a way of committing an 'honour killing' in rural southern Pakistan. </p> <p>\u0095 A 49-year-old man in Bradford, Jahangir Hussein, jailed last year for murdering his wife and two daughters because he (wrongly) thought they were having affairs. </p> <p>\u0095 Mohammed Merheban, a 25-year-old who killed his friend and brother-in-law whom he suspected of having an affair with his wife. He told Liverpool Crown Court he had committed the murder because his honour had been insulted. A family member told the court that, if he had not acted, 'he would not be allowed to live within that society. That is how people are brought up.' </p> <p>\u0095 A woman in Nottingham who died after being kept in her house for 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and a woman in Birmingham who was chained to her kitchen sink for months on end to prevent her leaving the home and behaving immodestly. </p> <p>\u0095 Jaspal Sohal, a west London woman battered to death by her husband with a hammer. He saw killing her as preferable to having her leaving him and 'damaging his izzat' (personal honour). </p> <p>\u0095 A young Sikh woman who married a Hindu man having her home burnt to the ground by her family. </p> <p>\u0095 A prospective son-in-law blinded in one eye by his fianc\u00e9e's Sikh brother - on the orders of his father - because he 'was not good enough'. </p> <p>\u0095 A series of suicides of young women told that they could not marry their lovers because they were from the wrong religious background or caste. </p> <p>There are many other cases involving serious violence where the 'honour' of some of those involved has been important. Legal documents studied by The Observer reveal a host of lesser incidents. They include cases of women being slapped after being seen talking to a man 'without permission' in the street or walking without a veil or even going to work. </p> <p>And there are, as with all domestic violence, tens of thousands of cases that are never reported to the police. </p> <p>Home Office specialists say that, in the UK, women who come to the attention of the police have been assaulted on average 30 times. Philip Balmforth, a police community officer who works with Asian women in Bradford, told The Observer he received about 300 requests for help from victims of abuse, abduction or forced marriages last year, twice the total of 1995. Last year 120 women came to him for help after being subjected to violence within the family. A quarter of those were assaulted by relatives other than their partners. </p> <p>He estimates he hears less than 1 per cent of such incidents. An Essex police report of 1998 refers to 'gross under-reporting' of such attacks throughout Britain and in the South Asian community in particular. </p> <p>'These girls are caught by a double whammy,' said one refuge worker who did not want to be named for fear of reprisals. 'If they are in a strict environment, they are more likely to suffer abuse. But they are less likely to report it.' </p> <p>Tjinder lives in east London. She is in her twenties, articulate and self-confident. She was married young to a friend of her father's and is now living in a refuge. Through an intermediary she told her story to The Observer . The details are kept vague to protect her and her family. </p> <p>'During the first year of our marriage there were indications my husband was abusive,' she said. 'There were things he would say that I wouldn't like. [Soon] the violence became a regular feature in our lives. I found myself having sex with him to keep him from beating or raping me. I was under enormous pressure not to talk about it.' </p> <p>When Tjinder did tell her in-laws about the assaults, she was told that she 'ought to be careful because as far as everyone in the community was concerned her husband was an honourable man and if she tried to leave him both their izzat would be questioned. When she spoke to her own family about the abuse their response was harsh. </p> <p>'They told me bluntly that no one would take me in... Your brothers are not going to put you up and your father is not going to give you roti (bread). Those were their very words,' Tjinder said. </p> <p>Tjinder was interviewed by Ayesha Gill, a sociologist at the University of Essex. In the past year she has spoken to hundreds of such victims of domestic violence. 'Asian women are taught to hide problems that may bring shame on the family or the community,' she said. Other researchers say the pressure of living up to expectations is a key factor in the high suicide rates for young Asian women. </p> <p>Many of those suicides concern police. In March last year Uzma Shaheen and her two-year-old daughter burnt to death in her own home. Her last words - screamed down the telephone to the emergency services as she choked on the smoke filling her bedroom - blamed her husband for lighting the fire. </p> <p>Shaheen was on the point of leaving her arranged marriage, a court heard this year, and had visited support workers dealing with abused women. Her husband was acquitted of killing her after a judge heard evidence that Shaheen had contemplated burning the house down and committing suicide in the months before her death. </p> <p>Other suicides lead to 'Romeo and Juliet' headlines in newspapers. In one tragic case this year a young Sikh woman hanged herself after being told by her parents that her relationship with a Muslim boy should stop. </p> <p>Such pressure to conform, combined with high expectations, can lead to massive strain on young women. Veena Raleigh, an epidemiologist who has studied suicides among Asian women, said the tight-knit domestic unit with a strong sense of family pride could be a contributory factor. </p> <p>'Such a close institution has tremendous pay-offs such as very low delinquency and very high educational achievement,' she said. 'But a problem is that women have no self-identity. You are a mother or a wife or a sister. You are never yourself. That leads to tremendous pressures.' </p> <p>In some cases suicide has nothing to do with failing to live up to expectations of a loving, if demanding, family. Some of those that Philip Balmforth, the community officer with Bradford police, deals with involve women who have been prisoners in their own homes. He has rescued young Pakistani women who, but for the journey from Manchester airport to a Northern town, have never left their flats or houses. </p> <p>Last winter Balmforth managed to get a woman out of a flat where she had been kept by her husband, a drug user. The marriage had been arranged in Pakistan and the woman could not speak English. 'We had to teach her how to use money, how to use telephones, how to take the bus.' </p> <p> Growing concern about a related issue - forced marriages - recently led the Home Office to set up a working group. Though the analysis was useful, its key achievement was breaking the taboo on publicly speaking about such an subject, experts say. </p> <p>But any government involvement is fraught with difficulty. There are estimated to be only around 100 forced marriages a year. Domestic violence - and the value systems that legitimise it - is a far thornier issue. </p> <p>Some fear that focusing on 'honour and shame' can lead to the Asian community being stigmatised and stereotyped. Baroness Uddin of Bethnal Green, who co-chaired the forced marriages report, told The Observer it risked reinforcing old and dangerous prejudices. </p> <p>However, activists such as Hanana Siddiqui of the Southall Black Sisters, say that, though the Home Office insists 'multicultural sensitivity' will not lead to 'moral blindness', the Government is wary of taking on the leaders of ethnic communities over cultural traditions. </p> <p>It is important to emphasise that, overall, levels of domestic violence in the Asian community in Britain are probably lower than the national average. Nor can religion be blamed. Muslim, Hindu and Sikh religious leaders all stress that their faiths are non-violent and abhor violence to anyone, especially women. Optimists say that, as the Asian community becomes more assimilated and the older, conservative traditionalism dies away, the issue will resolve itself. </p> <p>Often the victims of violence are women born or educated in the UK whose aspirations are very different from those of older family members. </p> <p>Shamshad Hussain, the Bradford community worker, remains worried. Change, she says, has to be carefully managed. </p> <p>'Unless we all unite to take an honest and strong, intelligent and open stance on this issue now, you are likely to see a backlash of traditionalism by young people, particularly young men, as a defence against Western values that threaten them and their traditional position.' </p> <p>For many Asian women in the UK, Hussain points out, it is already too late.</p>",
  "<p>There is no going back if you're driving the Tour de France route. The world's greatest bike race travels along the world's longest one-way street: 2,500 miles of closed roads around France lined with impassive gendarmes and screaming cycling fans, an interminable sens unique which always ends on the Champs Elys\u00e9es. </p> <p>As a spectacle, the Tour is as much a 2,000-strong parade of motor vehicles as a bike race. The 180 cyclists are hidden somewhere among the floats bunging out freebie publicity material, the imposing blue BMW motorbikes of the Garde Republicaine, garish vehicles carrying corporate guests, and cars bearing spare bikes and wheels. Unless they are strung out over an Alpine pass, the skeletally thin cyclists with their farmers' tans take only a couple of minutes to pass. The cars keep coming for hours and hours, and simply heighten the crowds' sense of anticipation. </p> <p>Apart from les coureurs, they have come to see the 'publicity caravan' (the 'junk train' to aficionados) - 250 vehicles advertising everything from insurance to mail-order clothing, including trick motorcyclists, go-karts with oversize gas cylinders on top, cabriolets from which hotpant-clad go-go dancers dance at impossible angles, and 8ft-high coffee machines on vans. </p> <p>To be strictly accurate, the crowds have not come to see, but to scrabble for the free samples - canvas washing bags, sachets of coffee, bags of sweets. It is a child's dream and a parent's nightmare. On Bastille Day this year, a 12-year-old boy was killed when a car containing public relations people from a race sponsor left the road. Given that an estimated 10 million roadside fans, some drunk and all hyper, watch the race each year, it is a wonder there are so few accidents. </p> <p>On the Tour, everything that can be done is done on the move. Cyclists receive medical attention hanging on to the race doctor's car at 30mph, and have their gears adjusted by mechanics hanging out of car windows. Corporate hospitality is a carefully choreographed waltz between cars driven by former Tour stars driving as close to the cyclists as safety permits, and plush mobile homes where uniformed hostesses serve caviar and champagne. </p> <p>The Tour's caravan takes over smaller venues such as Brian\u00e7on, a little fortress town in the Alps, which was gridlocked for a whole evening as the race vehicles merged with the cars and camper vans of thousands of cycling fans. That night, Britain's only cyclist in the race, the young David Millar, was outraged at spending two and a half hours sitting in the bouchon to go 15 miles to his hotel, and this after some eight-and-a-half hours in the saddle. </p> <p>As much attention goes into choreographing the four-wheeled show as into running the two-wheeled race. Parking is carefully planned, but always overflowing. Elaborate routes are devised for getting the Tour's cars through start and finish towns. Each 'family' - media, organisation, publicity caravan, teams - is segregated. Where the Tour starts and finishes is dictated as much by the need to find 2,000 car and lorry parking spaces as by aesthetic, sporting or commercial considerations. </p> <p>Each year since my first Tour in 1990, before I leave I come across a kindly, naive person who will ask 'and will you cycle, too?' A hollow laugh accompanies the answer: like all those who follow the grande boucl\u00e9 - the 'great belt' as it circumnavigates France - home for the four weeks is a car. Not because following the Tour entails sleeping in the car but because as each stage brings fresh countryside, a hotel which can be dive or ch\u00e2teau, a h\u00f4tel de ville or a marquee in a meadow serving as press room, the car interior is the only surrounding which stays the same. </p> <p>As well as the story of Lance Armstrong or Miguel Indurain, each Tour for me is the story of my car: a black box with no air conditioning during a particularly hot summer became known as 'Hole'; an eminently forgettable motor earned the name 'Pig'; a flighty young thing seemed to suit 'Sarah'. This year, it was the Tour of 'Le Bimmer' - a BMW 330d SE Touring to give it its full moniker - and we spent four weeks getting to know each other. And there were so many added extras in Le Bimmer that it took me almost the whole month to discover all of them. </p> <p>The Tour offers every motoring environment from Alpine passes to autoroutes, and Le Bimmer loved them all. There was power to spare uphill - even packing three adults and their luggage. 'Diesel' is a term used in cycling to refer to a cyclist who has superlative stamina, but no speed - the 330d, however, has plenty of the latter. There is none of the hesitation expected from a diesel engine, and a far better response than many petrol engines when overtaking. The bumph says it delivers 184bhp and 390NM of torque - a Tourman would say it surges forward like a sprinter flying out of the pack. </p> <p>On less-than-smooth roads, the ride was somewhat harsh - mostly due to the ultra-low-profile tyres and sports suspension - but this was a small price to pay for the traction when it came to hairpinned descents from the great Alpine cols, taken as if on rails with never a hint of tyre squeak or rear-end float. Autoroutes - as you would expect from a German product - were devoured smoothly and silently. </p> <p>Inside, attention to detail was ever-present, but never fussy. Extra storage space under the boot floor - although this would still be a tight fit for a family above the toddler stage - automatic headlight wash, central elbow rest at the perfect height. And optional gadgets, such as the Global Positioning System: perfect for finding a stage start in darkest, downtown Nantes. Occasionally, it provided perverse pleasure as I drove onwards, ignoring the electronic voice imploring me to make a u-turn. </p> <p>The biggest surprise, though, was the cost of running 'Le Bimmer' through France: she sipped as daintily as a Parisienne at her morning caf\u00e9 au lait - between 37 and 40 miles per gallon over the 5,000 miles, depending on terrain. In France, diesel (joyously), costs as little as 50p per litre at most supermarkets, and so I slipped back in time to the days when you could travel 450 miles and fill your tank for well under \u00a330. </p> <p>I spent most of the Tour wondering how Lance Armstrong managed to go so fast for so long on his anorexic diet: somehow, Le Bimmer pulled off precisely the same feat on four wheels as he did on two.</p> <p>\u0095 The Observer sailed with Brittany Ferries.

  "<p>Tony Blair is the best Prime Minister we have, and the Conservative Party is running out of feet in which to shoot itself. </p> <p>This seems to be the message of the recent seaside conference season, which has also seen the Chancellor, Gordon Brown, go from strength to strength, during intervals between his trips to the Group of Seven and International Monetary Fund meetings in Prague. </p> <p>Whatever else they have done, the revolts on the petrol and pensions front have shaken New Labour out of its complacency and forced it to listen. If it does not go on doing so, the Government faces not so much a threat from enthusiasts shouting, 'Don't be vague, vote for Hague' as the kind of mass abstention that has afflicted Labour in most local and European elections since 1 May 1997. </p> <p>The Conservatives' principal problem continues to be that New Labour has stolen most of its clothes. Labour's problem is that, unless it shows some respect for these embarrassing elderly relations who constitute its core vote, it could yet screw up its best mandate since 1945. </p> <p>Labour needed a shock, and it has received several. This is no bad thing. Provided the Government shows that it has learnt something from recent grass-roots revolts, it - and we - should be all the better for the experience. The position of the parties is reversed, but there are parallels with 1982-1983, when, for various reasons, Labour was deemed unelectable and Margaret Thatcher, however unpopular her domestic policies (as opposed to her Falklands policies), was given another chance. </p> <p>The main difference is that whereas Thatcher Mark One had made an unholy mess of the economy, Labour under Brown's chancellorship is generally credited with remarkably good economic stewardship. </p> <p>While admiring much of what he has achieved, some of us have had reservations about two principal areas: one is the way the combination of Gordonian economy and Treasury parsimony have produced a number of mean-minded decisions - on single mothers; on pensions in general and war widows in particular; and on student grants or the lack of them. All these are unworthy of a left-wing government with a budget surplus that would have embarrassed even Gladstone. </p> <p>The Conservatives have been too stupid by half in trying to trump Labour on public expenditure. What their claims really boil down to is that they will spend more than Labour does now on this or that public service, simply because in the natural way of things public expenditure is likely to grow year by year anyway. Its growth would be less than under Labour's current plans, that's all. </p> <p>And anyone who puts his or her faith in the insurance companies as a way of augmenting the good work of the beleaguered health service is referred to the article that a lifelong believer in private insurance, the late Jock Bruce-Gardyne, wrote in the Spectator when the time came for him to collect from Bupa and it was found wanting in his hour of need. </p> <p>The Government is certainly spending on the public services from now on, but one continues to wonder whether it was really necessary to have that two-year freeze at the beginning. </p> <p>The second reservation about Brown's stewardship has been the 'hands-off' attitude towards a pound which has been so high that it has been damaging two vital sectors, manufacturing industry and agriculture. An exchange rate regime in which Nissan's European showpiece factory in Sunderland struggles to make money is one that is seriously out of kilter. </p> <p>There are always time lags in these matters, and the full force of the regime has not yet been felt in an economy that has profited from a combination of a global economic boom and the relative absence of inflationary pressure - an absence not uncon nected with the fierce international competition associated with the phenomenon known as 'globalisation'. </p> <p>The impressive collection of economic experts who produced the Liberal Democrats' recent pamphlet Britain's Adoption of the Euro concluded that the range of 'possible sustainable entry rates' was between DM2.45 to DM2.84, against around DM3.25 now. </p> <p>In Prague, the Chancellor told a press conference, against the background of the G7 intervention to stabilise the euro, that the current sterling/euro rate was 'not justified by fundamentals' and, again 'not justified by any look at long-term fundamentals'. Admittedly Brown had made the same point earlier in the summer in his James Meade lecture at the London School of Economics; but, taken in the context of Britain's participation in the G7 operation, this began to sound like a major change of policy and an attempt, at last, to encourage the pound down to more realistic and sustainable levels. </p> <p>Alas, when the details of the G7 intervention were duly published last week, it turned out that Britain's participation in the multi-billion dollar support for the euro was a mere $70 million or so, and that it sold the euros the same day. This makes Britain sound not so much like a member of the G7 as half a member. It was the first time the British establishment had intervened in the market for sterling against European currencies since Black Wednesday (16 September 1992), although there may have been some intervention later in that decade vis-a-vis the yen. </p> <p>So, it was a major change of policy - and it lasted several hours. The Treasury is now busily briefing that its intention was to strengthen the euro, not weaken the pound for domestic reasons. </p> <p>The Bank of England can, within its restricted balance sheet, intervene to lower the pound but only, as I understand it, as part and parcel of its remit to achieve the inflation target. Some members of the Monetary Policy Committee have favoured intervention, but they have been outnumbered. </p> <p>Still, we have it on record that Brown thinks the pound is overvalued, even if he is reluctant to draw the obvious operational conclusion. At least the implication is that he thinks it's overvalued. For all we know he may believe it is fundamentally undervalued. </p> <p>So there we have it. The Treasury has dipped a toe in the intervention waters - but only a contorted little toe.</p>",
  "<p>Guy Hands, the City 'golden boy' who last month withdrew his \u00a3105 million offer for the Millennium Dome, is eyeing Sydney's Olympic Park as the jewel in the crown of his new global operations. </p> <p>Hands, head of the principal finance group at Japanese Investment Bank Nomura, is sending a team to Australia in the next two weeks to open discussions with the New South Wales government over the site of the 2000 Olympics. He wants to turn it into a leisure and retail theme park. </p> <p>With the success of last month's games, Olympic Park - which includes the Olympic Village and sports facilities - is now seen as one the world's premier leisure sites. The contrast with London's Dome could not be starker. </p> <p>The Sydney site is one of a range being considered for leisure and retail development by the 40-strong team originally assembled at Nomura to roll out its proposals for the Millennium Dome. </p> <p>Since the failure of negotiations over the Greenwich attraction with the New Millennium Experience Company last month, the team - whose original title 'Dome Europe' has been dropped as a result - has been looking for other high-profile opportunities. </p> <p>There have been recent rumours that the Japanese bank is considering re-entering negotiations for the Dome, but Nomura sources said there was no possibility of it rebidding. Suspicion as to the origin of these rumours centres on the New Millennium Experience Company, which is currently trying to close a deal with Legacy, the group headed by millionaire Labour donor Robert Bourne - which was originally outbid by Nomura. </p> <p>The Japanese bank's favoured targets now include a \u00a3100m expansion and modernisation project at the UK's biggest conference venue, the National Exhibition centre in Birmingham; Germany's Expo site in Hanover; and a greenfield development outside Amsterdam. </p> <p>A successful bid for Sydney's Olympic Park would be a coup for Nomura, which views it as a 'very exciting opportunity' despite being further afield than was envisaged in the original Dome Europe plans. </p> <p>Details provided by the New South Wales government indicate that it backs a theme park option for the Olympic site, which would fit well with Nomura's leisure model. </p> <p>'It is a wonderful opportunity, although it is still early days,' said a Nomura source, who confirmed that the team would be visiting within two weeks. </p> <p>Nomura's plans involve a combination of entertainment and retail facilities, with leisure acting as the main draw for visitors, and retail providing the main revenue stream. </p> <p>Each development will focus around a show - with other entertainment, educational, retail and restaurant facilities. </p> <p>It is looking for sites that fulfil key criteria - urban location with a high residential population, potential for entertainment, retail and restaurants, high-quality transport links and the possibility of redeveloping brownfield areas. </p> <p>Hands will have to negotiate to secure capital from Nomura's board in Japan.</p>",
  "<p>So you have decided on an equity Isa and you want a managed fund, but you also quite fancy chancing your arm. </p> <p>You've got some spare money to play with that you are prepared to tie up for five years or more and, if you lose it all, it won't be the end of the world. </p> <p>You reckon that tracker funds and diversified global funds are for wimps; you are bored with waiting for Japan to recover; and even technology funds are yesterday's news. </p> <p>So where do you look to invest? If you are really prepared for a white-knuckle roller coaster ride, single-country funds could be the asnwer. </p> <p>Single-country funds in this context are not invested in the mainstream markets of the UK, the US or Japan, but more typically in places such as Russia, Korea and Chile. </p> <p>These are the markets which can provide returns of more than 100 per cent plus returns one year, and then lose fistfuls of cash in the next.They are the markets for which the phrase 'high risk/high return' was invented </p> <p>But while a wide range of single country funds are available to offshore investors, opportunities are more limited onshore. Even where they exist, they are not always available through an Isa. </p> <p>Schroder, for example, has a Korean fund (Schroder Seoul) which is not available through the group's ISA. </p> <p>Philip Middleton, head of investor services at Schroder, explains: 'We don't have a lot of demand from retail investors; it's very speculative. An Isa is usually someone's first equity investment, and Korea is not really the sort of market they should be in.' </p> <p>Korean fans will have no better luck at Save &amp; Prosper or Barings, where the groups' Korean funds are also off limits to ISA investors. As the Korean market was down by more than 40 per cent at 20 September from the start of the year, this is may be just as well. </p> <p>Old Mutual, however, is offering its Thai fund in an Isa format. </p> <p>Graham Kane, Old Mutual Fund Manager's chief executive, admits: 'It is always going to be a roller-coaster ride. We believe people should start with the basic building blocks - UK, Europe, America, global. They have to work their way down quite a long list before they come to Thailand.' The Thai market fell by 48.3 per cent between January this year and 20 September. </p> <p>'This is a very specialist product,' says Kane. 'Investors have to come in with their eyes wide open. It was Thailand's banking crisis which led Asia into the crisis, and the rest of Asia has recovered faster.' </p> <p>Chase Fleming Asset Management offers two sin gle-country investment trusts which are Isable - Fleming Chinese and Fleming Indian. </p> <p>The group's Mike Connors says that it offers all of its funds through an Isa, although he admits that these two are probably 'the least suitable for the private investor'. </p> <p>Shares in Fleming Indian, for example, are currently selling for 79p, down from a high of 127p in February. </p> <p>Worse still, anyone investing about four years ago could have bought shares at a 9 per cent premium to their net asset value. They have now slumped to a 24 per cent discount. </p> <p>Both trusts currently have quite a large retail shareholder base, partly because of the number of investors with an ethnic affinity to the regions. </p> <p>However it is not all gloom and doom. Single- country funds investing in more established markets - especially European ones - have turned in some fairly respectable performances this year. </p> <p>Invesco's French Growth fund, managed by the same team than runs Invesco's table-topping European Growth fund, has grown by 88 per cent, while Baring German Growth has increased by 43 per cent. </p> <p>Old Mutual also offers a Swiss fund (not quite in the same risk category as the Thailand offering, says Kane) which has grown by 12 per cent in the past year, and a Hong Kong and China fund, which has grown by 31 per cent. </p> <p>'Increasingly Hong Kong and China are becoming a single market,' he says. At the moment the fund is invested 75 per cent in Hong Kong and 23 per cent in China. </p> <p>But aside from people who hold definite views about the regions - those who believe that China is an economy of the future for example - Chase Fleming's Connors advises caution. </p> <p>'They should definitely not form a core part of anyone's portfolio,' he says. 'They are very volatile, but then again, if you time it right, volatility can sometimes be your friend.'</p>",
  "<p>In February, we asked three independent financial advisers to create two investment portfolios for us - one which aimed for capital growth and the other to provide an income. </p> <p>Seven months on, we are taking another look at the investments to see how they have done, and whether any should be changed. </p> <p>A lot can happen in seven months - particularly in the financial markets. Our fledgling portfolios had barely poked their beaks out of the nest when trouble pushed them back. In March, internet stocks, which had seen stunning growth for months, were caught in a frantic sell-off. And over the summer, the swelling price of oil kept a lid on stock prices. </p> <p>Each of our three IFAs had their own idea about what to do with the \u00a350,000 portfolios. </p> <p>In the growth portfolio, Kim North, of Calkin Pattinson, opted for a high exposure to technology and internet stocks, while Jason Hollands, of discount bro kers Best Investment, worked across a wider range of funds. Some of these took in specific geographical regions, such as South East Asia and Japan. </p> <p>Stephen Dight, of Grosvenor Financial Services, resisted picking out individual funds, choosing instead to leave the market-guessing to the experts. </p> <p>He split all but \u00a37,000 between three different strategies operated by Rothschild Asset Management - where the asset manager picks from a range of funds at their own discretion. </p> <p>Even the \u00a37,000 was invested in a Rothschild Five Arrows Isa. The IFAs also displayed individual styles picking income portfolios. Hollands chose to spread the portfolio between a range of seven corporate bond and other income-producing funds, North chose three income funds, incorporating some capital growth in the form of HSBC's UK Growth &amp; Income fund. Dight kept to his fund of funds method. </p> <p>'The fund of funds approach really does work,' he says. 'Less paperwork, easy to understand and much lower charges on switching which is effected without any client involvement.' </p> <p>North said she was fairly pleased with the figures for her income portfolio. 'The yields are excellent, driven by the ABN Amro Equity Income fund - it's been outstanding,' she says. </p> <p>But the picture is not quite as rosy for her growth portfolio. The rout in internet stock prices hit North's funds quite hard. </p> <p>Hollands said all the funds he had chosen remained strong contenders in their sectors. </p> <p>So would the IFAs make any changes to their portfolios now? </p> <p>Dight says not at this point - and this was the whole idea of choosing the Rothschild funds. Rothschilds can make switches between trusts within its strategies at substantially less cost than those incurred by investors choosing their own funds due to the discounts they can achieve, he points out. </p> <p>For her income portfolio, North says she would make no changes because none of the funds included have suffered any management changes. </p> <p>However, even though the growth portfolio's performance was hit by the slump in technology stocks earlier this year, she says she would not rush to change the portfolio's composition just yet. </p> <p>'We expect that by the end of the year the new economy will have bounced back, so the recommendation on all funds is a hold,' she says. </p> <p>But she will keep an eye on the Henderson Global Technology Trust, she says, since the staff and managers there have just announced they are leaving to set up a private investment 'boutique'. </p> <p>The Johnson Fry Slater Growth fund was hit hard by the fall in internet stocks, but North says she is still confident in fund manager Mark Slater's ability to turn performance around. </p> <p>Hollands says there are a number of elements he would now change in the portfolios, because there have been management various changes. </p> <p>The money in Gartmore's UK Smaller Companies fund should be switched to Gartmore's UK &amp; Irish Smaller Companies fund, which is smaller and more nimble. The UK-only fund went further up the market capitalisation scale at the wrong time, he says. </p> <p>Since the manager of the M&amp;G European Smaller Companies fund has left, that investment should be switched to Invesco's European Smaller Companies fund. 'It was very much a one-man bet,' he says. </p> <p>Management has changed at the Credit Suisse Transatlantic fund too, and Hollands advises jumping ship to the Framlington American Growth fund. </p> <p>In the income portfolio, Hollands says he would switch the M&amp;G High Yield Corporate Bond Isa for an investment in the Newton European High Yield fund. And he would now sell the stake in the M&amp;G Corporate Bond fund, using the proceeds to buy into the Legal &amp; General Fixed Interest fund. 'The head of the retail team at M&amp;G has gone on a sabbatical,' he says. </p> <p>This exercise shows how different portfolios can change over just a few months. But the advisers pointed out that the performance is not representative of the growth stocks and shares can achieve - the period was simply too short. </p> <p>'Nobody should ever go into stocks and shares for a six-month period,' says North. Anyone who might need to use their money in the short-term should choose to keep it in cash.</p>",
  "<p>Older unit trust investors may remember the Motorways Fund. Then came property funds, commodity funds and funds invested in the financial sector. Theme funds - unit trusts invested in a particular investment theme or sector - have been around for a long time, but they have seldom made a lasting impression. </p> <p>This time though, it is different, we are told. Aided by the dramatic upsurge in the technology sector, theme funds are back with a vengeance and Isa investors have an increasing number to choose from. </p> <p>And, while technology leads the way, there are also healthcare, biotech and telecoms funds and funds combining different themes, as well as more general funds pursuing a thematic investment philosophy. </p> <p>The thematic approach is a different way of investing money. Whereas the traditional investment manager looks at the world, country by country, and then sector by sector, the thematic investor argues that these global boundaries have broken down and are no longer relevant. Communication, they argue, is now so good that what starts as a trend in the US today, rapidly spreads from market to market. Companies and industries now think, and act, globally. </p> <p>So instead of looking geographically, thematic investors look for emerging trends and then invest in companies which are likely to benefit as a result. </p> <p>'It's like a food chain,' said one fund manager. 'You find the theme and then track it back to those companies which feed off it.' </p> <p>Gary Marshall, managing director of Aberdeen Unit Trusts, managers of one of the most successful technology funds, believes theme funds are popular 'because investors can relate to them much more'. </p> <p>'Technology, communications and healthcare all touch people's lives. They see what is going on around them and want to be a part of the success stories.' </p> <p>Aberdeen recently extended its theme range with the launch of the Global Champions fund aiming to exploit the themes of globalisation, innovation and communication. </p> <p>Another fan of thematic investment is Tim Wilson, chief strategist at Newton Fund Managers. 'You have to think laterally,' he suggests. 'Once we have established a theme we put it to the analysts and fund managers who identify companies which will be beneficiaries of these themes and put them in their portfolios.' </p> <p>Wilson cites mobile phones. 'You don't just invest in the operators like Vodafone, but in the people who make the handsets, the chips that go in them and the companies that build the towers that the operators stick their radio masts on.' </p> <p>And thematic investment doesn't just work for global, or regional funds. 'Say you believe in Asian recovery and you think the construction industry will benefit as a result.' he says. 'But you don't like any of the Asian construction companies because their balance sheets are poor. Thinking laterally, you may buy Blue Circle for your UK fund because it has strong links with Asia and could well be a beneficiary of the Asian recovery theme.' </p> <p>Not everyone, however, is convinced by the sudden conversion to theme funds. Alan Beaney, head of investments at Principal Investment Management, believes it may be just the latest fad. </p> <p>'Theme funds have been around for a long time, but you don't hear much these days about gold funds, commodity funds or European privatisation funds. The \"new economy\" is a buzzword, but theme funds end up with too many eggs in the one basket; they lead to biased portfolios. </p> <p>'One man's theme fund is another man's bandwagon,' he reckons. </p> <p>Nigel Thomas, fund manager of the highly successful ABN Amro UK Growth fund, has operated in a thematic way for many years, but has some sympathy with Beaney's view. 'Trends are like horses,' he says. 'They are easier to ride in the direction they are already going. You have got to avoid the sort of hype we had with the internet bubble. Long term, we seriously believe in software, but we avoided all the dotcoms. You have to see through all the puffery.' </p> <p>ABN Amro uses a team approach to come up with themes. 'In the main, we find a global theme and then track it back here and find out how you can play it in the London market.' </p> <p>Thomas lists a number of themes he is currently following such as photonics , remote sensing, fuel cells, online logistics, innovative semiconductor design, organic foods, garage forecourt retailing, outsourcing, mobile telephony with internet, digital imaging, discount retailing, green pharmaceuticals and genomics. </p> <p>'Theme funds have a place,' argues Amanda Davidson, of IFA Holden Meehan. </p> <p>'But it depends very much what the theme is. Technology and healthcare make good sense,' she says, but stresses that these are higher risk funds and should occupy no more than between 5and 10 per cent of anyone's portfolio.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Contact:</strong> 01892 596098 </p> <p><strong> Aim:</strong> To provide a lower risk way to achieve growth through socially responsible investment. </p> <p><strong> Bells &amp; whistles:</strong> NPI says its new socially responsible with- profits fund, offered as part of the package, is unique in enabling ethical investment without direct stock market exposure. </p> <p><strong> How it works:</strong> The bond offers a choice of funds in any combination: the with profits fund, and NPI's unit linked Global Care (average annual return 12.6%) and Global Care Managed (average annual return 13.1%) funds. The with profits fund will invest in Global Care Managed fund. The funds are all managed by Henderson, NPI's sister company. The with profits fund will award an initial annual bonus of 5 per cent. Up to 10 per cent can be withdrawn each year without penalty. </p> <p><strong> Minimum: </strong> \u00a310,000 </p> <p><strong> Charges:</strong> No initial charge. Allocation rates range from 100% to 103.5%. Annual charges 1.25 % for unit linked funds, and built in to with profits fund.Withdrawals over 10 % in the first five years incurr penalties - 9 % of the withdrawl in the first year,decreasing by 2 % each year to 1% in the fifth. Withdrawals from the with profits fund after a market fall may result in an investment devaluation by NPI. </p> <p><strong> Tax:</strong> Returns are taxed within the funds, so basic rate tax payers have no further tax to pay. Higher rate payers can withdraw up to 5 per cent of the original investment each year, deferring payment of extra tax until the entire investment is withdrawn. Non tax payers cannot reclaim tax already paid. </p> <p><strong> Risk:</strong> Medium </p> <p><strong> Should you buy it?</strong> Ian Beestin of The With Profits Bond Shop in Nottingham says this is not the best with-profits bond, but it is an excellent development for ethical investors. He recommends ethical investors stick to the with profits fund, and use an ISA for investing in other funds. </p> <p>John Turton of Best Investment in London rates Henderson but doubts if people over 60 will be interested in ethical investment. </p> <p><strong> Points out of 10:</strong> Beestin - 7, Turton - 6.</p>",
  "<p>It really is grim down south. New research confirms what many southerners have suspected - living standards are higher in the North of England. Yes, people in the South East do earn more, but their living standards are among the lowest in the country because they pay far more for food, transport and housing, according to the Regional Trends report published by the Office of National Statistics. </p> <p>Someone working in Middlesbrough earned an average of \u00a317,490 last year, and people in Greater Manchester were paid an average \u00a319,438, while Londoners generally were paid\u00a328,812 and those working in the City itself received a whopping \u00a343,288. </p> <p>But the cost of buying a home, travelling to work and groceries are also much higher in the South. While the weekly food and drink bill for one person comes to \u00a315.57 in the North East, it is\u00a317.99 in London and \u00a318.88 in the South East. And while the weekly national average household expenditure is \u00a3332.60 and only \u00a3282.90 in the North East, the bill increases to \u00a3376 in London and the South East. </p> <p>However, the biggest problem for anyone trying to buy a home or raise a family in London and the surrounding commuter belt is property prices. Lawrence Davies, a solicitor who works at North Lambeth Law Centre in south London, is paid \u00a323,000 a year. His salary is above the national average of \u00a320,919, but below the average for London, and he has found it impossible to buy a family-sized home for himself and his wife within reasonable travelling distance of work. The couple, who have been married for just over a year, are thinking of starting a family in two or three years, and will need somewhere larger than their one-bedroom flat in Kingston. </p> <p>But Davies says: 'Anything with two or more bedrooms is going to cost more than \u00a3100,000. My wife is planning to return to college and, whatever income multiples you use, my salary just won't cover a \u00a3100,000-plus mortgage.' </p> <p>The couple are contemplating a move to Oxfordshire, which would mean a long and tiring journeys to and from work for him. </p> <p>One of his law centre colleagues is quitting the Law Centre to move to Leeds. 'He can't secure a rental property in London because the market is so competitive, and he can't afford to buy,' says Davies. </p> <p>The Halifax House Price Index shows the the scale of the problem. Although prices fell in London by 2.4 per cent during the second quarter of this year, the cost of the average London property is still \u00a3145,104 - nearly three times higher than in the North (\u00a356,228) or in Yorkshire and Humberside (\u00a355,494). Semi-detached houses in Greater London fetched an average of \u00a3210,100, nearly four times more than the cost of an equivalent home in Northumberland (\u00a356,250) and nearly five times more than in South Humberside (\u00a344,800). </p> <p>If struggling to meet the monthly mortgage payment doesn't make your life purgatory, commuting to work will. Transport costs are much higher in London and the South East. While a monthly Metro pass to all areas of Newcastle costs \u00a339.25, and a monthly bus and train pass in Manchester costs \u00a368.50, a monthly pass for all zones in on London Transport will set you back a huge \u00a3136.00. True, Londoners have shorter journeys to work, but they spend much longer commuting - an average of 32 minutes compared with only 18 minutes for commuters elsewhere in the country. </p> <p>These findings are, to some extent, con tradicted by the Indices of Deprivation 2000, published by the Department of the Environment. This report, which came out in August, shows that nine of the 10 most deprived areas in England are in the North. That data, covering most accepted measures of the quality of life, including job opportunities, health, housing, education and access to basic services such as post offices and shops, shows that northern towns and cities such as Middlesbrough and Liverpool suffer the worst social conditions. The only exception is Great Yarmouth in Norfolk. The 10 least deprived areas are in the South and Midlands, according to this study, which doesn't take living costs into account. </p> <p>But Londoners don't believe any of it, and are voting with their feet. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation finds that 48,000 more people leave London each year than move to the capital from other parts of the country. </p> <p>And contrary to popular belief, the pressure on housing in the South East has not been caused by northerners migrating south. The real culprit is an exodus of Londoners pushing up prices in the surrounding areas as they swap life in the capital for those longer commuter journeys and higher travelling costs. </p> <p><strong>Rich and poor </strong></p> <p><strong>Most deprived areas</strong></p> <p>1.

  "<p>The man from the Intelligence Bureau wanted to know exactly what I was up to in Multan. He had spotted me walking through the bazaar with my host, Moin, and had been so alarmed at the spectacle that he had rung Moin at his family home at eight the next morning. Moin, the director of a local non-governmental organisation, is no friend of the military dictatorship, and is accustomed to low-level harassment from the authorities. I heard him assure the secret policeman that I was merely a 'writer of cricket stories' and that my visit had nothing to do with politics. This wasn't strictly true but I was happy to bow to Moin's preference for discretion over valour.</p> <p>'That man is very happy now,' Moin informed me. 'Cricket is the best passport you can have in Pakistan.' </p> <p>Multan in the southern Punjab is renowned for heat, flies and beggars, but in the early spring it's a balmy place, with a dilapidated medieval centre speckled with blue-glazed Sufi shrines. That day I drove south through a landscape of shady canals, green fields and mango orchards. In nearby Bahawalpur I visited the Dring Stadium, the country's oldest international cricket ground, where Hanif Mohammed scored the first Test century on Pakistani soil in 1954.</p> <p>Little of note has taken place there since. The one-day international circus rarely alights at the Dring which, like southern Punjab as a whole, seems a victim of discrimination and neglect. Nonetheless, it remains an attractive ground with a 1930s pavilion. While the malis weeded the outfield, the surrounding gardens and alleyways were packed with boys playing cricket. Barefoot fast bowlers with whippy actions hurled battered composite balls at batsmen who played shots all around the wicket. There's no academy in Pakistan, no development system, but young prodigies keep bubbling up from below. </p> <p>In Bahawalpur, as elsewhere in Pakistan, I was interrogated with polite determination. What was my opinion of the Pakistani cricket team? Since it was obvious that Pakistan had the world's most talented cricketers, why did the team lose so often? Why did they keep changing the captain? Who could explain the selection policies? In sum, what was wrong with Pakistani cricket? As elsewhere, they didn't need me to tell them the answers. They muttered about corruption, mismanagement, favouritism, factionalism. Their contempt for the rulers of Pakistani cricket was as fierce as their pride in the brilliance of Pakistani cricketers. I asked them who would win tomorrow's one day international against Sri Lanka.</p> <p>'Pakistan, of course,' said a studious-looking wicketkeeper in glasses and baseball cap, then added, 'unless...' and rubbed his fingers together in the universal sign for the bottom line.</p> <p>The next day I made my way into the Cholistan desert. In a remote village there was an annual mela, an immemorial gathering of the clans around the sand dune shrine of a folk saint. Transvestites dance and smile. Nomadic families are camped out with their animals, cooking and chatting in the sun. Singers and drummers keep up an endless rhythmic drone. A group of boys squatting next to a herd of young camels listen to a small radio broadcasting the ball by ball from Karachi. I approach and ask the score. Pakistan are batting well. They are making a big score. But then, a wicket falls. There's a burst of excited static from the radio. The boys fiddle with the tuner. They shake their heads. One looks at me with a grim smile and rubs his fingers together.</p> <p>To grasp the impact of the cascade of match-fixing rumours and revelations in Pakistan and India, you first have to grasp the importance of cricket within south Asian culture. Imagine the British interest in football, rugby, cricket, tennis, golf, snooker and athletics all rolled into one, then add in pop music and television soaps, and you begin to get the scale. Sachin Tendulkar has been repeatedly named not only as the most widely recognised living Indian, but also the most respected. In England, it's a rare occurrence for an event in the cricket world to hit the front-pages. In India and Pakistan, it's routine. India has the second largest population in the world, and Pakistan the sixth, but they barely featured in the medal winners' table in Sydney. For societies eager for a hike in global status, cricket is a rare and welcome balm, a compensation as well as a distraction. In this field alone they have produced world-beaters, so when the world-beaters' probity and patriotism comes into question, emotions run high. </p> <p>'The automatic equation between brilliant-cricketer-therefore-brilliant-human-being is a difficult one to break,' says Sharda Ugra, sports editor at India Today, the country's biggest English language weekly. On her way back from reporting on the King Commission inquiry into the Hanise Cronje scandal in South Africa (the magazine's cover story), she found herself trying to explain to incredulous cricket lovers some painful realities about one of India's greatest sporting heroes, the all-rounder (and until recently, national coach) Kapil Dev. 'It took me the better part of three hours to convince two people sitting next to me in the plane that Kapil might be involved in the scandals. When I told him about all the times that Kapil had refused to do interviews if he wasn't paid, this middle-aged businessman could only say, \"But he is my hero!\"</p> <p>'The die hard fans are still struggling with the fact that their heroes could be guilty of doing what Cronje did,' says Ugra. 'But the newer followers, that section of the population that had switched during the past 10 years from being totally uninterested in cricket to being riveted by the television spectacle, a lot of them female, retired people, are now disgusted and put off. It is this lot who have made what I call the \"reality-switch\" very quickly.' </p> <p>Perhaps the saddest feature of the whole affair is that so few people in India believe anything will come of it. After all, scandals of much greater import to Indian society - and involving greater sums of money and equally famous names - have come and gone with the culprits still at large. No one ever faced trial in either the Bofors or Hawala scams, which were considered political earthquakes in their day. The rich and well-connected, it seems, will always escape justice. While the Indian criminal justice system grinds slowly, sponsors and advertisers have been quicker to pass judgment. Suddenly the ubiquitous adverts featuring famous cricketers plugging everything from air conditioners to men's suits have vanished from the screen. A recent television advert gives some idea of the prevailing mood. It shows four people sitting around watching cricket on the box. The screen flickers and the picture is distorted. One of the viewers gets up and says the cable must have shifted.</p> <p>'Match fix kar doon?' ('shall I fix the match?'), he asks. His friend answers that there's no need; the problem can be 'fixed' from a seated position - and then extols the television's new remote control features.</p> <p>There's a wary cynicism in the popular response to the match-fixing scandal, but it doesn't seem to have reduced the popular appetite for cricket. Vendors of cricket equipment insist the scandal has had no impact on sales and the demand for places in cricket clubs and coaching clinics is as insatiable as ever. Since the ICC Knock-Out Trophy currently under way in Kenya will be the first international cricket played by India since the scandal broke in April, it remains to be seen whether television audiences have kept faith with the game. </p> <p>People in India can't seem to make up their minds whether Manoj Prabhakar is a hero or villain in the match-fixing melodrama. The former Indian all-rounder was always known as a member of the awkward squad, and had already made his share of enemies long before he began muttering about bookies and bribes in 1997. His allegations were investigated by the Chandrachud Commission and dismissed as unfounded.</p> <p>Earlier this year, following Cronje's confession, Prabhakar equipped himself with a hidden camera and videotaped a number of private conversations with players and administrators. The explosive results were aired on Indian television in May. One after another, cricketers, broadcasters, coaches and cricket board members confirm Prabhakar's allegations. One after another, they concede that match-fixing is 'going on all the time' but that 'there is nothing you can do about it'.</p> <p>'Prabhakar's videotapes have had a huge impact on the non-believers,' Ugra observes. 'A lot of us knew there was antagonism and backbiting and insecurity within cricket, like there is in any sport, but there were plenty who gave cricketers the benefit of the doubt. I think no one could predict the extent of the rot.'</p> <p>One of the documentary's saddest, most revealing moments occurs in a conversation between Prabhakar and Navjot Singh Sidhu, the former Indian opening batsman, a gritty crease-occupier and, like Prabhakar, renowned as a difficult customer. On the tape, Sidhu makes it clear that while he does not dispute Prabhakar's allegations, he must turn down his old friend's pleas to back him in public. 'I know you very well, but first listen to me. Even if you go to someone else, he will not go along with you. Nobody. After all, Kapil Dev is not an ordinary person. He is a respected man in this country. Highly respected. If you lift a finger against a respected man and you don't have proof, it's like inviting trouble. Secondly, I'm indebted to Kapil Paaji. He gave me an opportunity to play no matter what kind of person he is. I owe him a debt. I don't want to be dragged into this. I don't get involved in any matter, leave alone a matter of this importance. They (journalists) call me everyday. I don't even say,\"'No comments\".'</p> <p>Sidhu's paranoia, like Prabhakar's whiny desperation, tell us a great deal about big-time Indian cricket. This is a climate in which patronage and personal favour count, in which success on the field is never enough. It is not a climate in which whistle-blowers flourish.</p> <p>As a result of the Prabhakar tapes and King Commission testimony, India's Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) stepped up its probe and in mid-July the Income Tax department launched high-profile raids on cricketers and cricket board personnel. With a characteristically south Asian nostalgia for the game's lost innocence, tax officials dubbed the raids 'Operation Gentleman'.</p> <p>From Kapil Dev to the former chairman of the International Cricket Council, Jagmohan Dalmiya, few were spared. Although the information gathered is still under review and no charges have been brought, newspapers have printed lurid accounts of the eye-popping wealth uncovered in the course of the raids. If nothing else, the press leaks have re-inforced the popular conviction that corruption in the game is widespread. 'I am delighted that these raids took place,' said Khushwant Singh, one of the country's best-known columnists. 'Personally, I am relieved. I have stopped watching cricket altogether.'</p> <p>Whatever they may add by way of circumstantial evidence in the match-fixing cases, in themselves the raids merely confirm that international cricketers are no different from other rich Indians. The hoarding of undeclared assets is standard practise among the country's *lite. For that *lite, there is now a growing danger that the match-fixing scandal will overspill its boundaries. Jaya Jaitly, the president of the Samata party, a partner in the governing coalition, held a press conference in Delhi to denounce the 'high-handed' raid on the homes and offices of Ajay Jadeja, the middle-class heart throb with the princely pedigree who has been repeatedly named in connection with the scandals. Jaitly's daughter works for Jadeja and is said to be engaged to marry him. The politician took particular umbrage over the 'personal' questioning of her daughter ('by my own government') and accused the tax officials of asking for 50,000 rupees (\u00a3750) to hush up the case. 'They asked for food and demanded rotis made at home, not bazaar stuff.'</p> <p>In the wake of the tax raids, both Muhammad Azharuddin and Kapil Dev were interrogated by the CBI. They were also named frequently in Prabhakar's tapes. Imagine Kevin Keegan and Gary Lineker in the dock, and you'll get a small idea of how the heavens have fallen in the sub-continent. </p> <p>I first laid eyes on Muhammad Azharuddin at Eden Gardens in January 1985, when the then 21-year-old neophyte compiled a measured Test century against England. The crowd that day - full to its 100,000 capacity, patient, knowledgeable, appreciative - seems to belong to a different world to the crowds that surge into the grounds for today's one-day internationals - feverishly partisan, quickly bored, and mostly indifferent to anything other than national victory. </p> <p>And apart from the still flexible wrists, the world-weary, besieged celebrity who turned out for Asia against the Rest of the World at the Oval this summer seems a very different person from the modest, tongue-tied, unworldly lad who put the English bowlers to the sword at Eden Gardens. In those days, he shared a home in a low-income housing colony in Hyderabad with 17 other family members. Today, according to the reports leaked from the income tax raids, he is the owner of seven luxury properties in Bombay, six imported vehicles, 20 designer wristwatches and several closets worth of Armani and Versace togs. </p> <p>At the Oval, every time Azhar touched the ball, the crowd let fly. 'Account number kya hai?' (What is your account number?). When he fluffed a catch in the slips, it was 'Payment late?'. The umpires were urged to 'check his pockets!'. Compared to what is likely to greet him in India, if he ever plays cricket there again, it was mild.</p> <p>Azhar was named by Cronje to the King Commission as his initial link man with the bookies, nd on the Prabhakar tape Ravi Shastri, the former Indian all-rounder turned TV commentator, describes him as 'the asshole' who 'must be shifted'. Panicked by the rising tide of accusation, Azhar did something he had resisted in the past; he played the minority card, claiming that he was being singled out for attack because he was a Muslim.</p> <p>Azhar captained India through much of the 1990s, a period that coincided with the rising influence of a right-wing Hindu nationalism pumping out an ugly anti-Muslim message. Like other Muslims prominent in the entertainment world, he went out of his way to assert his patriotic credentials and in particular his desire to defeat Pakistan on the field of play. Hindu bigots heaped praise on him for showing the country what a 'loyal Muslim' should be. However, he was already being criticised by conservatives - both Muslim and Hindu - for his divorce and subsequent marriage to Sangeeta Bijlani, a Bombay model. On the outside, Azhar remained a diffident figure. But those who know him insist he changed. The globe-trotting, the lavish lifestyle, the adoring crowds, the easy money are all blamed for ruining the one time innocent.</p> <p>Azhar also suffers from a subliminal association with the 'Muslim underground', the criminal empire said to be run by Dawood Ibrahim from his safe haven in the Gulf. There is little that goes wrong in India that some people are not prepared to lay at Dawood's doorstep; his alleged links with just about every powerful figure in Indian life - from politics to cinema to sport - keep conspiracy theorists working overtime. As the Prabhakar tapes confirmed, Dawood is a real presence in cricket, and has appeared in both the Indian and Pakistani dressing rooms. But if there is a specific link between Azhar and Dawood - as former Indian captain Ravi Shastri alleges in the Prabhakar tapes - it has nothing to do with Islam and everything to do with money.</p> <p>Azhar is a creature of the culture of individual acquisitiveness that swept through the upper echelons of Indian society in the 1990s. In business, politics and culture, it was the decade of hype and hustle, a scramble for scarce privileges in a poverty-blighted society. A packaged patriotism was married to a deregulated business environment, and Azhar was only one of many pulled into the resultant maelstrom. </p> <p>As rumour followed rumour, Kapil Dev found his hitherto unchallenged public standing hopelessly compromised. Journalists began publishing some of the things they had already known for a long time, particularly about Kapil's business affairs. The Gujerat state government announced that it was ordering the removal from school text books of a chapter celebrating the great all-rounder. In early September, Kapil was interrogated by the CBI, and pressure built up for him to resign as coach of the Indian team. This was a delicate matter for the cricket board. How do you rid yourself discreetly of a tainted national hero? Everyone wanted Kapil to go, but no one wanted to be seen to push him out. So the board reportedly floated rumours that it might be looking for a replacement, then publicly denied the rumours and invited Kapil to remain in charge. </p> <p>Besieged by the media, Kapil submitted his resignation, which was then accepted by the board with a show of regret. Privately, it had been made clear to Kapil that if he delayed any longer, he would have to be sacked. Sharda Ugra described the episode as 'a classic example of Indian cricket's theatre of the absurd' dictated by 'a tragi-comic compromise formula.' The legendary slow bowler and long-time loose cannon Bishen Bedi dismissed Kapil's exit as 'stage managed.' Indian captain Saurav Ganguly was surprisingly terse: 'Frankly, it doesn't matter who the coach is.' </p> <p>The board was said to be divided over how to handle Kapil's disgrace. Having excluded all those players named in the match-fixing imbroglio from the squad for the ICC Trophy (which meant no places for Azhar or Jadeja), it seemed strange that the axe should not also fall on the national coach. But then, the axe had also spared two other individuals involved in the tax raids - the powerful Dalmiya and the board treasurer Kishore Rungta. 'What happens to the board officers will indicate the intent and extent of Indian cricket's clean-up,' commented a still sceptical Ugra.</p> <p>As for Kapil, the once vivacious and uncomplicated competitor has slunk away from the public eye, wounded and bewildered. 'I cannot explain anything,' he told a journalist. 'You are free to write what you wish. I have nothing to say. Let me be. Please.'</p> <p>Shortly after Pakistan's elected government was ousted by a military dictatorship last year, Lt General Tauqir Zia was installed as head of the cricket board, assisted by a phalanx of army and air force personnel. For the current military rulers, cricket serves much the same purposes as it served their predecessors, generals Zia Ul Haq and Ayub Khan: an instrument for legitimising the regime and for distracting the masses. It is also, now, a means for the military to demonstrate its main justification in the eyes of the people - its claim that it will root out the corruption that bedevilled the civilian system. So far there's little evidence of improvement, in cricket or elsewhere. </p> <p>It was in Pakistan that the match-fixing scandal began in 1994, when Salim Malik was accused of attempted bribery by Shane Warne and Mark Waugh (who, it later emerged, had themselves accepted payment from bookies). Nearly six years later, after three inquiries supervised by the cream of the Pakistani judiciary, the result is that former captain Salim Malik and medium-pacer Ata-ur-Rehman have been banned for life (their international careers were finished in any case). Six others, including Wasim Akram, Saeed Anwar, Waqar Younis and Mushtaq Ahmed, have been fined amounts between $2,000 and $6,000. The fines will be deducted from their match fees. </p> <p>Judging by the published reports, the case against Akram seemed much weightier than the one made out against Ata-ur-Rehman. Akram remains, however, a key member of the side. Colonel (Retd) Rafi Nasim, a former head of the cricket board and now a columnist for a daily newspaper, declared that the fines 'will act as a last nail in the coffin of match fixing as far as Pakistan is concerned. Of all the countries allegedly involved in this evil practice Pakistan was the most prompt as well as logical in dealing with this issue.' Not everyone agrees. A citizen has lodged a petition in the Sindh High Court calling for all the players named in the final report to be banned from the game and prosecuted for criminal offences. </p> <p>Turning from tragedy to farce, Pakistani cricket has recently been rocked by one of its rare sex scandals. Or at least that' s how the local press have reported it. Three promising international cricketers were found in the company of of a number of young women in the team's Karachi hotel rooms on the eve of their flight to a tournament in Singapore. The players insisted that the women were fans who had barged their way in, and the manager says his investigation confirms their story. Nonetheless, they have each been fined \u00a3800 and banned from the ICC tournament in Kenya. Lt General Zia explained: 'I had to strike a balance as PCB chairman and that I did without destroying the careers of the players. I have penalised the players for their indiscretion although there was no evidence against them.' </p> <p>So although the alleged perpetrators of this poor excuse for a sex scandal were declared innocent, they were still fined some two thirds of the amount that was levied on players acused, and found guilty, of match-fixing. The popular all-rounder Shahid Afridi, one of the three players who may or may not have committed a minor misdemeanour in the Karachi hotel, bewailed his predicament. 'My father, mother and brothers have been very critical of my actions. They have been reprimanding me. None of them are ready to believe me. I am at a loss as to what my action should be. </p> <p>Those who raised this false allegation have managed to establish it as a truth. However, I can swear by God to prove my innocence.' Unfortunately for Afridi, many Pakistani (and Indian) cricketers have made similar declarations in recent years, and too often they have proved hollow....</p> <p>Today, in India and Pakistan, people follow the unfolding match-fixing scandals, and see in cricket a vivid picture of a malaise that blights both their societies: the lawlessness of the rich, the unaccountability of the powerful, the cynical manipulation of public institutions and popular spectacles for private gain. But that is not all they see in cricket. </p> <p>If the England players make the most of their opportunities, what they'll experience once they've wandered outside the luxury hotel perimeter is the world's most fervent grass-roots cricket culture. It's only when you watch a gang of raggedy kids construct a wicket from a couple of bricks on a gravel-strewn vacant lot next to a shanty town, and then watch them play a pick-up game with fire and flair worthy of a one-day international, that you realise the creative intensity of south Asian cricket, and the scale of its betrayal. </p> <p>\u0095 Mike Marqusee is the author of Redemption Song: Muhammad Ali and the Spirit of the Sixties (Verso, paperback) which has been voted one of 25 'Books to Remember, 1999' by the New York Public Library.</p> <p><strong>The accused and the accusers </strong></p> <p><strong>South Africa</strong><br>The King Commission of Inquiry set up after the Hansie Cronje revelations in April heard extensive testimony from players and officials indicating the extent of matchfixing in international cricket. It was revealed that the entire South African team held a meeting to discuss whether or not to accept bribes to throw a match in 1996. As a result of its preliminary findings, Herschelle Gibbs and Henry Williams were banned from international cricket for six months. Gibbs was fined \u00a36,000 and Williams \u00a31,000. Meanwhile King Commission chief prosecutor Shamila Batohi has visited India to exchange information (and tape recordings) with the Indian police. Further investigations are currently under way and a final report is still pending.</p> <p><strong>Pakistan</strong><br>After much delay, Justice Malik Mohammad Qayyum's report into matchfixing was published in May. As a result of its recommendations, Salim Malik and Ata-ur-Rehman were banned for life; six other leading internationals - including Wasim Akram, Waqar Younis, and Saeed Anwar - were fined $2,000-$6,000. Akram is considering an appeal. According to the report, he was given 'the benefit of the doubt' but is now 'too sullied' to serve as captain and should be kept under 'strict vigilance' while a further probe is made into his finances.</p> <p><strong>India</strong><br>The Central Bureau of Investigation is now said to be finalising its mammoth report, which should be made available to the Sports Minister this month. It may implicate at least two Indian cricketers and several foreigners in illegal activities. The selecters decided not to wait for the report, and have already dropped four of the 'tainted' players - Muhammad Azharuddin (pictured above with his wife), Ajay Jadeja, Nikhil Chopra and Nayan Mongia - ostensibly 'on merit'. National team coach Kapil Dev has also been forced to resign.</p> <p><strong>Australia</strong><br>Shane Warne and Mark Waugh were fined for accepting money from bookmakers in 1995; the Australian Board hushed up the incident, which only became public in 1998.</p> <p><strong>England</strong><br>Have yet to make public their investigation into the match-fixing allegations made by Chris Lewis. It is rumoured that English cricketers may be among those to be named in the Indian CBI report.</p> <p><strong>ICC </strong><br>Cricket's governing body has established a Code of Conduct Commission, chaired by Lord Griffiths, a former High Court judge and president of the MCC.

  "<p>For as long as I can remember, people in football have talked about the likelihood of all the major leagues in Europe being devalued by the formation of a full-blown international club Super-League. </p> <p>Much as I hate to have to admit it, all the evidence suggests that this step to an elitist environment inhabited only by the clubs with the greatest financial potential and box-office appeal is inevitable, and that we are quite close to it occurring. </p> <p>One major step towards the concept, of course, has been the change in the European Cup format - the development of the competition from a straight knock-out tournament to a league contest - which has created something of a safeguard against the big clubs being knocked out by those at the other end of the scale before they have had the chance to make the money they need to justify their massive expenditure. </p> <p>The latest sign of where the game is heading concerns the Uefa's plans to introduce a licensing scheme for the top clubs throughout its 51 member countries. </p> <p>Under that system, which was outlined in these pages last month, it would not be enough for clubs to qualify for the Champions League or the Uefa Cup through their achievements on the field. Entry would also depend on factors such as their financial position (the extent to which they were in debt); the size of their pitches and the capacities and facilities at their stadia. </p> <p>In the latter respect, Uefa apparently want the stadium criteria for participation in their competitions to include a 150-seat press box, three TV studios and a 300-seat media working room. </p> <p>For me, David Bowen, the general secretary of the Northern Ireland Football Association, really did hit the nail on the head when he said: 'There is a general feeling among the smaller FAs in Uefa that the big boys do not want our teams playing in the European cup competitions. The squeeze is on.' </p> <p> When it comes to having an upmarket football home - a place that will not lower the tone of the game at the highest level and that even the likes of Manchester United and Real Madrid might enjoy visiting - I do not think Uefa will turn their noses up at the new 45,000-capacity stadium being built for Coventry. Among its numerous state-of-the-art features are a retractable roof and a retractable pitch. </p> <p>However, as Coventry are among the group of clubs who cannot hope to be as big as the traditional giants, my feelings about what is happening at the latter's level to give them a bigger advantage than ever should be obvious. </p> <p>One of the problems for Uefa is that because of the greater number of countries and teams following the break-up of the old Soviet bloc, the overall standard of their competitions has probably declined. </p> <p>The standard has certainly been dissipated in the qualifying competitions for the World Cup and European Championship. At the preliminary stages, there are too many one-sided matches or matches in which the good teams find it difficult to lift themselves. </p> <p>However, while I would be in favour of some form of preliminary qualifying competition for the smaller countries, there is no way that I would want to see them out of the World Cup or European Championship picture altogether. </p> <p>It's the same for clubs striving to take part in the Champions League or Uefa Cup. </p> <p>The Uefa plan represents just one more step towards ensuring that clubs with dreams of bettering themselves - clubs like Coventry - have the door closed on them. </p> <p>In general, I agree that the higher the level of the competition, the more important it becomes for there to be certain standards. However, if a club cannot satisfy these, there is an alternative to stopping them from competing - surely, it is merely a matter of allowing them to play home matches somewhere else. </p> <p>For me, the only things that really matter - outside the actual standard of foot ball the teams are capable of producing - are that the stadiums are safe for spectators and that the pitches are in good condition. </p> <p>Anything over and above that criteria is immaterial as far as I am concerned. When people talk about poor playing surfaces causing matches to become contests of power and luck as opposed to skill - and thus hampering teams with the greatest technical ability - I am immediately reminded of some of the mud-heaps I experienced during the early part of my career in Scotland. </p> <p>Playing at Morton could be a particular nightmare. The pitch was such a quagmire in one match there that, when my boot flew off, it took me ages to find it. </p> <p>Generally, though, the standard of pitches is excellent nowadays. It has to be - if one is going to charge high admission prices to the top matches, it is only right that the conditions are conducive to good football. </p> <p>Whether the Uefa moves towards that European Super League could also be deemed conducive to good football is another matter. The Champions League is nothing like as appealing to the fans as the old European Cup. It often strikes me that the only people who like it are the competing clubs' bank managers. </p> <p>Call me an idealistic fool if you like, but I cling to the view that football should be about more than money - and that every team must feel that they have a chance of success.</p>",
  "<p>The Temple pub nestles between two redundant steel factories on Rotherham's Sheffield Road. Licensing laws notwithstanding, it used to be heaving with steel workers 24 hours a day. Last Monday at 5.30pm, there were just three drinkers in the Temple. On the juke box, Elton John was singing 'Don't let the sun go down on me'. It already has. </p> <p>Next door to the Temple in a cavernous former British Steel factory, frantic workers are rushing to create a \u00a337 million theme park based on the steel and coal industry in time for its Easter opening next year. The factory once employed 1,500 people. When Magna opens next year, 150 will run it. </p> <p>Senior staff at Magna know that if this Lottery-funded project is to work and win the respect of sceptical locals, new companies, in particular multi-media firms, will have to locate to the fringes of this huge site. Visitor attractions, after all, have a limited shelf-life. As catalysts of regeneration, they don't always work. </p> <p>But as things stand few businesses would dream of coming to Rotherham or South Yorkshire. This is because skills levels here are among the worst in the country. A workforce whose members for generations were guaranteed a job didn't need to pay any attention at school. Their children, seeing how their dads were thrown on the scrapheap with no alternative offered, gave up. The result? A deep socio-economic crisis. </p> <p>In Grimethorpe, home to the famous colliery brass band, heroin and crack pose serious problems for this small, resilient community. Residents in sink estates outside Doncaster literally air their dirty washing for all to see as whey-faced kids roam the streets with nothing to do. And the last time Rotherham hit the front pages? The discovery last year that a 12-year-old girl was expecting a baby fathered by a 14-year-old boy. </p> <p>During the past 15 years there have been various attempts to regenerate South Yorkshire after an estimated 160,000 workers lost jobs in the coal, steel and engineering industries. The Tories, having destroyed 'the enemy within', set up City Challenge funds to rebuild communities. The trouble was, these initiatives placed the emphasis on bricks and mortar regeneration assuming that businesses would flock to the area to take up the slack once foundations were in place. They didn't. </p> <p>After Tory Minister Michael Heseltine rang the death knell of the coal industry in 1992, an emergency package of aid was set up. This included Single Regeneration Budget funds. The trouble is that rival regions compete for funds and more than half the applicants fail. The failures are normally from communities that do not have the resources to plough into a coherent bid - the very communities which SRB funds are there to help. </p> <p>Swept to power on a wave of optimism in 1997, the Labour Party pledged to revitalise depressed coal mining communities. Its response to the Coalfields Taskforce was considered to be the most important step forward for England's mining communities for decades. </p> <p>Three years later, progress has been made. The Government has set up the Coalfield Regeneration Trust with \u00a355m to plough into community-led initiatives over three years. One year down the line, grants worth \u00a320m have been committed. It is now crucial that the CRT extends its funding for another three years. Negotiations are ongoing. </p> <p>The Government has allowed English Partnerships, the regeneration quango, to assume control of most of the coalfields to fast-track redevelopment. </p> <p>But progress in transferring the coalfields has been held up by lease complications and a recent EU judgment which ruled government intervention on regeneration sites as 'anti-competitive'. </p> <p>The Government has set a framework by which South Yorkshire can fight back, but what could really make a difference to the region is a \u00a3700m EU Objective One grant announced last July which, as it has to be, will be matched by another \u00a3700m from the Government. </p> <p>Objective One grants are given to areas deemed to be poverty stricken, and there are many Yorkshire folk who see the windfall as confirmation of abject failure. Action plans by the local Regional Development Agency, Yorkshire Forward, are being fine-tuned, but most money will be spent on education, training and employment opportunities. </p> <p>Objective One cash, despite having lost \u00a350m in value since the collapse of the euro, is seen by those in the area as its last chance to get itself on an even keel. </p> <p>'EU enlargement means that other countries will get it in the future,' explained Mike Bower, acting deputy director of the Yorkshire's Objective One project team. 'We won't get this amount of cash from Europe again.' </p> <p>If handled correctly, this cash could lever another \u00a3400m of public and private money into the area, making a total of \u00a31.8 billion. That it might be wasted is the great fear preoccupying South Yorkshire. </p> <p>'Inevitably, we'll get duplication on the ground. With so many agencies, local councils, employment organisations, training bodies, it gets very complicated. I don't know the answer,' said Sara Turton, Yorkshire Forward's Learning &amp; Skills manager. </p> <p>But for those who have been thrown on the scrapheap, egos, corruption and inefficiency cannot be tolerated. This is South Yorkshire's last chance. It must not be blown. </p> <p><strong>Carving out a new living</strong></p> <p>It would take a hard man not to be inspired by the Wildwood project next to the former Bentley mine in South Yorkshire. The project was set up last year with \u00a3250,000 of grants from the Church Urban Fund, Coalfield Regeneration Trust and the John Paul Getty Junior Trust. </p> <p>The initiative trains the long-term unemployed in making furniture from recycled wood. Later this month, it is forecast that Wildwood will scoop a Chambers of Trade Investors in People award. </p> <p>The project is currently driven by the vicar of Bentley and a former deputy managing director of the Scotsman newspaper group. </p> <p>In this financial year, Wildwood has turned over \u00a39,000 in sales. It has got a long way to go to be self-financing. </p> <p>But it has just won a contract to supply a local museum with exhibition cabinets, is identifying other niche markets and is talking to retail partners to sell products ranging from mahogany dining tables, toy boxes and garden furniture. </p> <p>Such is the energy and drive pulsing through Wildwood that you don't think those involved in it will allow it to fail. </p> <p>Graduates from its courses have either been employed within the company or have found employment outside it. Only two have given up, both through ill-health.</p> <p><strong>Retraining delivers jobs</strong></p> <p>With numbers in the coal and steel industries slashed, unions have found it hard to adapt to the post-industrial age. </p> <p>But ISTC, the principal steel union, has over the last year increased its numbers by 7 per cent to nearly 35,000 thanks to retraining ex-steel workers. It is the first time a British union has taken this approach - using a model which came from the United States. </p> <p>Staffed largely by redundant steel workers, its new body, the Steel Training Partnership, counsels those put out of work, offers them training and tries to find them new jobs. </p> <p>The organisation is held back by a lack of IT teachers and the sheer number needing help. </p> <p>In Rotherham, STP has found people jobs in tree surgery, product auditing and telecommunications, and helped a number of non-union members to study for childcare qualifications.</p>",
  "What will happen to the peace dividend if the new power-sharing executive in Belfast collapses? As David Trimble fights for his political life, business leaders fear that Northern Ireland's economic recovery will be put at risk if the new devolved institutions are seen to falter. <p> Since the Belfast Agreement was signed in 1998, economic progress has been dramatic. The so-called peace dividend is immediately visible in the scale of new buildings - hotels, office blocks, shopping centres. </p> <p> The Waterfront Hall where David Trimble met the critics within his own party yesterday is a symbol of how things have changed. The airy building stands beside the River Lagan alongside the recently built Hilton Hotel. </p> <p> It is sometimes hard to remember that only a few years ago people were searched as they entered shops and restaurants in Belfast. The official statistics confirm the gains that have been made as a result of the peace process. Once an unemployment black spot, the jobless rate in Northern Ireland is now running below the European Union average. There has been steady success in attracting foreign investment, particularly in hi-tech industries. </p> <p> There are still big problems to be tackled. Northern Ireland's traditional manufacturing industries like shipbuilding are in decline. New jobs will be needed to replace those lost in the police and security firms. These will require people to have different skills, something that can only be achieved by retraining and education. </p> <p> The new assembly at Stormont is currently debating Strategy 2010, an ambitious economic plan which aims to raise Northern Ireland's GDP to 90 per cent of the UK average over the next 10 years. This is a serious consideration of long-term strategy which is far removed from the rancorous scenes when political leaders trade insults over the peace process. </p> <p> But economic progress will be put at risk if the political institutions like the Assembly are seen to falter. Peace isn't just a matter of lack of violence on the streets although this is obviously necessary to persuade multi-national companies to invest. </p> <p> Political stability and a sense that Northern Ireland's leaders are ready and able to take control of the economy are also necessary. So George Quigley, Chairman of Ulster Bank and one of the province's most respected businessmen, believes that the role of the Assembly is vital in deciding policy and ensuring that economic targets are achieved. He points to the role which political leaders 'and an almost obsessive drive for economic growth' have played in shaping the success of the Republic's economy. </p> <p> This has been missing in Northern Ireland for obvious reasons. Direct rule has meant that local politicians have lacked the clout to lobby effectively in the corridors of power. Thirty years of violence have taken a very heavy toll on the infrastructure. The province benefits from transfers of \u00a36 billion from the British Exchequer, but Northern Ireland has been unable to match the tax incentives which have brought foreign investors to the Republic and this will only change if the Treasury can be persuaded, by local politicians, that the province needs special consideration. </p> <p> Some of the problems remain outside the control of the local politicians, but many important decisions on funding for education, the environment, health and so on are being taken by local Ministers at Stormont. Peter Mandelson, the Northern Ireland Secretary, has warned that the flow of investment and economic benefits that have been a result of the Good Friday Agreement could slow down if the peace process continues to lurch from crisis to crisis. </p> <p> The emphasis in the media over the next few weeks, as unionists for and against the Belfast Agreement argue over Trimble's future, will be on bitterly divisive issues like policing and the handover of IRA weapons. Hospital closures, the threat to Belfast shipbuilders Harland &amp; Wolff and the debate on the 11+ exam will hardly rate a mention. These are issues of huge importance to most of the people in Northern Ireland, and they would like to see decisions on them being made by local politicians. That opportunity will be lost if the executive collapses.</p>",
  "<p> On Zanzibar, the local television station has been known to set up a camera on a street corner and leave it there for hours, broadcasting live: fragments of conversation; the odd car; women walking past in full purdah. A sort of low-budget Muslim Big Brother . Rewind the tape a few centuries and the people passing by would have been Portuguese, Arab and English merchants fighting over this lush trading post in the Indian Ocean. Unjuga (Zanzibar's Swahili name) had sugar and spice and, not so nice, a roaring slave trade. Up to 30,000 Africans were sold here every year for most of the nineteenth century. </p> <p>Today, there's an internet caf\u00e9 in Stonetown, but it's tucked away in a maze of streets where Indian balconies, colonial verandahs and the deserted palaces of Omani sultans quietly crumble into the sea. The voices of children singing the Koran really do ambush you in sidestreets. Zanzibar's slave market has disappeared under an Anglican cathedral. The hotel where I'm staying is built alongside the ruins of a missionary school for freed slave girls (a cousin of William Thackeray was headmistress). Now a woman from Oxfordshire gives great aromatherapy massages there. </p> <p>Tourism is still at the polite stage. There is, as yet, no Freddie Mercury heritage trail (the singer was born here), no festival of Babar (the elephant was born here, too). Developers are only just beginning to flout the law that says you can't build higher than the surrounding palm trees. Go now, while the beaches are postcard-perfect: white sand, green sea, the triangular sail of a lone dhow. </p> <p>You can buy moonstones on Mastercard; you should book for dinner at Emerson's &amp; Green, a hotel run by three gay Americans. Or simply barter for bangles on the seafront with Masai craftsmen, then turn up at Two Tables on the off-chance. There are only two tables, crammed on to a balcony; no menu - you eat what's put in front of you. After settling up, the owner may switch on a ghetto blaster and his teenage daughters may appear at the door in headdresses and livid lipstick, and dance round the living room to taarab music looking daggers. </p> <p>Everybody I know who's been to Zanzibar has been on a spice tour, but don't let that put you off. It's the best way to get up into the island's jungle interior, along empty avenues of skyscraping coconut trees, past boys on bicycles too big for them, to a sunny plantation where you can stick your nose into handfuls of vanilla, cardamom, cinnamon and lemon grass that Jamie Oliver could only dream of. </p> <p>Finally, if you do go to Zanzibar, leave! There's a tiny strip of land eight miles away on the horizon and it's even better. Chumbe Island (pronounced Choom-bay), all 1km by 300 metres of it, sounds a bit worthy: it's a nature reserve which beat 115 projects from 42 countries last year to win British Airways' Global Tourism for Tomorrow award. But the fun starts the minute the boat picks you up from Zanzibar after breakfast, pitches and churns through crystal water towards Chumbe's dense treeline and white lighthouse, and (oh goody) drops you off in the shallows to wade ashore holding your possessions aloft as if arriving for a Robinson Crusoe convention. </p> <p>That night we all drink champagne and Tangawizi (kicking local ginger beer) in the dramatic vaulted remains of the lighthouse keeper's house: candles guttering, sea crashing all around, food delicious (plantain, fish, curries, real coconut rice). </p> <p> Chumbe Coral Park was founded by Sibylle Riedmiller, a German environmentalist in her seventies who visited the uninhabited island in 1991 and was overwhelmed by its pristine coral-rag forest and shallow-water reef - protected, oddly enough, by lying close to the Dar es Salaam shipping route which has been off-limits to fishermen since colonial times. Six years and $600,000 of her own money later, Riedmiller finally persuaded the Tanzanian government, which owns Chumbe, to turn it into an eco-resort for the free education of local children. Many can't swim. In Swahili, there is no word for coral. </p> <p>The project is proudly self-reliant thanks to tourism. Only 14 overnight guests are allowed on the island at a time and they must have 'zero impact' on the fragile eco-system. Ideally there would be no visitors, but every drop of income from the honeymooners and stressed executives who stay here is invested in conservation and education. If all goes to plan, the running of Chumbe will one day be a purely Zanzibari affair. </p> <p>Life quickly telescopes into little things: the fresh pincer tracks of coconut crabs in the morning; the hide-and-seek exertions of a hermit crab intent on commuting across the sand. At low tide, Chumbe acquires an aircraft-carrier overhang you can walk under looking for starfish. It takes about 40 minutes to circle the island. Climb the 131 steps of the lighthouse, built by the British in 1904, and you get the full 24-hectare extent of a place so thick with vegetationno one has seen its rare deer population in years. </p> <p>Chumbe's project manager, Eleanor Carter, an ecologist (from Slough), heard about her dream job while working as a pianist at a bar in Stonetown. She trains local fishermen as park rangers who patrol the island to prevent illegal fishing, record scientific observations, and help sad specimens like me who have never knowingly snorkelled to put on flippers and get vertigo over shoals of barracuda, gainly turtles and little fish of the Everton mint family. </p> <p>You know that Chumbe is a labour of love the moment you clap eyes on your state-of-the-art eco-bungalow, or banda , where gothic thatch meets salvage chic. There are seven of them, each with a hammock made from washed-up driftnet, and shipwrecked-crockery mosaics. Solar panels heat the rainwater collected by the roof; there's a compost toilet. </p> <p>For air-conditioning, the banda has no front wall; it's just you and the Indian Ocean.

  "It would really be jumping the gun, churlish even, to announce that the honeymoon is over. Of course it isn't. It has barely begun! Tomorrow European Union Ministers will begin the process of dismantling the sanctions that have helped to keep Serbia isolated and impoverished. The US and other Western nations will follow suit. Within weeks diplomatic relations will be restored with Belgrade. <p>With joyous small ceremonies there'll be a rush of flag-raising over embassies and, if all goes well, Tito's ghost, which haunts Manhattan's East River, will finally be laid to rest. </p> <p>That ghost is, of course, the old Yugoslavia that died at the hands of Slobodan Milosevic. Thanks to a bizarre series of diplomatic manoeuvrings the old Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia, which stretched from the Alpine hills of Slovenia to the dry plains of Macedonia, still exists as a 'member' of the United Nations. The East River and the UN's Palais des Nations in Geneva are the last places on Earth where the old red-starred flag of Tito's country still flies. </p> <p>Not for long. Soon, no doubt, President Kostunica's Yugoslavia will have sorted out its status along with its re-entry into the plethora of international bodies - primarily the financial institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. </p> <p>Western Ministers should also soon begin signing cheques for the millions of dollars earmarked for a post-Milosevic Serbia under the terms of the Stability Pact, intended to aid and integrate all of the Balkan states. </p> <p>So far so good. But, then a few weeks or months down the line the country will wake with a sore head. The empty coffers, the factories good for nothing but scrap, the small farmers who find it hard to compete in a global market. And, of course, the equally tough questions of Kosovo and responsibility for almost a decade of wars. </p> <p>In the short term Kostunica and his supporters will have to clear out the institutions of all the vestiges of the ancien regime . Because of the curious nature of Yugoslavia's constitutional set-up Milosevic's allies still control the parliament, government and presidency of Serbia. The recent elections were for the Yugoslav parliament and presidency. But as Milosevic and all his friends began to congratulate Kostunica on his victory on Friday, it began to look suspiciously as if many of them intended to try to hang on to their posts. </p> <p>Until Friday it had been assumed that once Milosevic had gone the whole apparatus of state he had created would go with him. Now, the situation is less clear, despite the obvious power vacuum. </p> <p>In principle, President Kostunica should soon be able to lay the ghost of Montenegrin secessionism because most Montenegrins were not anti-Yugoslav as much as anti-Milosevic. But this may be far more difficult than it at first appeared, because Kostunica and his supporters need the votes of the Montenegrin party that used to support Milosevic in the federal parliament if they are to form the next Yugoslav Government. They may succeed but if they do, they will alienate the pro-Western President of Montenegro, Milo Djukanovic. </p> <p>As the economists begin to examine the accounts of Serbian industry, they will discover not only the mass of debt but also that, as Serbia is rapidly reintegrated into the rest of Europe, most of it will no longer be able to compete. Ten years ago, for example, there was little to choose between a Yugo car and a Czech Skoda. Now Skodas compete on an equal footing with cars from the world's top manufacturers but the old Zastava factory which makes Yugos produces barely 5,000 a year. Unemployment will rise. Sanctions and isolation have impoverished Serbia but they have also helped protect uncompetitive domestic production. That shield will go. </p> <p> </p> <p>The war criminals issue is one that is bound to dog Kostunica. A lawyer by training, he has denounced the International War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague as a 'monstrous institution' and regards it as a political court set up to condemn Serbs. The question is whether the West will decide to keep quiet over the issue or continue to demand that Serbia hand over Milosevic. </p> <p>Until Friday it looked as though Milosevic was a hunted man. Then he met Kostunica, congratulated him on his victory and said that he intended to remain as head of the Socialist Party of Serbia and continue in political life. If he does this, with Kostunica's blessing - and if other high-level indictees, including the President of Serbia, Milan Milutinovic, do the same thing - then a frost may descend on relations between Serbia and the West. So far it is too early to say: yesterday morning opposition sources said that they intended to press criminal charges against Milosevic for ordering the police to fire on demonstrators last Thursday. </p> <p>In Belgrade, human rights activists are divided as to what the recent developments mean. Natasa Kandic, director of the Humanitarian Law Centre, says that she believes the international community 'will not stop talking about the issue'. Others are more sceptical, fearing that in their rush to welcome back Serbia to the fold of normal countries the whole question will simply be swept under the carpet. </p> <p>Kosovo is another issue that is bound to help end the Kostunica honeymoon. Kostunica has said that Nato troops are in Kosovo thanks to Milosevic. He has emphasised that Kosovo is part of Serbia and he intends to seek its return. In fact, whatever any Serbian leader says, Kosovo's Albanians will never agree to any association with Belgrade again, and in the short-term attacks on Kosovo Serbs may increase lest anyone think that a new spirit of reconciliation is abroad. </p> <p>Until the early hours of yesterday morning tens of thousands were still literally dancing in the streets of Belgrade. Serbia has changed and is changing. But, over the next few weeks and months we may find that it has changed less than expected. </p> <p> Tim Judah is the author of The Serbs: History, Myth and the Destruction of Yugoslavia </p> <p> <b>Dictators: Where are they now?</b></p> <p><b> Jean-Claude 'Baby Doc' Duvalier</b></p> <p>Former dictator of Haiti, Duvalier fled in 1986, snatching millions of dollars from the Central Bank.

  "<p>Vincent Canby, The New York Times's worldly-wise film critic, once wrote of Sidney Poitier that the actor 'does not make movies, he makes milestones'. In the age of Denzel Washington, Wesley Snipes and Chris Rock, Poitier's influence runs the gamut of American cinema. Put simply, the man has few peers. </p> <p>Poitier interviews are a rarity - he has always shrouded his lives, both personal and professional, in secrecy. Now well into the autumn of his life, he takes his place alongside Muhammad Ali, Nelson Mandela and Martin Luther King Jr as one of the 20th century's most eloquent voices on race.</p> <p>Poitier's office, replete with several thousand feet of deep pile carpeting, varnished floorboards, books and paintings, is set within the Sierra Towers apartment block. The building nudges the postcode margins of Beverly Hills and Hollywood. His assistant Marlene greets me at the door of the fifth-floor office - closely followed by Poitier. The actor's apartment is next door. 'Good to see you,' he says, offering up a palsy handshake. He holds a patio door open to a balcony and ushers me out on to a wraparound walkway that leads to his home.</p> <p>Poitier's reception room is congested with furniture - antique Italian, French and African collectables. Stools, mini-tables and chairs compete for every inch of available space. The historical gumbo is impossible to steer a path through, and I tiptoe carefully across the floor. Coffee tables heave under the weight of bric-a-brac: beach pebbles, gilded paperweights, pens, markers, trinkets, timepieces, statuettes and trays filled with loose change and ornamental wood carvings. 'Make yourself at home,' says Poitier. 'We'll get started soon.'</p> <p>As he wanders back on to the balcony to have his photograph taken, I saunter around Poitier's apartment. Next door, a TV room - fitted with pastel-green cupboards - is adorned with books and videos: The Illustrated Twentieth Century, The Green Mile, Heat and his own In the Heat of the Night. </p> <p>A sofa cushion proclaims a blank machismo universal to American marketing, 'If You Want Breakfast in Bed, Then Sleep in the Kitchen'. </p> <p>There are dozens of framed photographs - Bill Cosby and Poitier, Mandela and Poitier, Harry Belafonte and Poitier, a promotional photograph for The Blackboard Jungle, pictures of his six children, and Poitier and his second wife, Joanne Shimkus. A mantelpiece stores numerous awards - a 1963 Nato trophy for 'Star of the Year', the American Film Institute's Lifetime Achievement Award from 1992, and an Oscar for Best Actor, awarded to him in 1963, for Lilies of the Field. </p> <p>While waiting for The Observer's photographer to assemble his photographic equipment, Poitier slides into an armchair by the balcony walkway. 'Sit you doon,' he says, gesturing towards a dinky, gold-lacquered Italian stool nearby. I perch myself on the edge, and we traffic a quick exchange on photography. 'I sometimes like the pictures photographers take of me,' says Poitier. 'I don't know what they see, though,' he adds, thoughtfully. 'What are they looking to capture?'</p> <p>He looks at me and I lean forward to adjust my T-shirt. Only then am I aware of a sinking gravitational pull, augmented by a thwack as the stool gives way. I find myself splayed on the ground, staring at the ceiling, knees bent before me. Rolling over on to my front, neither manfully nor gracefully, I gawk embarrassedly at the extent of my destruction -a broken stool leg lies nearby.</p> <p>Fumble, fumble. 'Was there something defective with the stool? Surely I couldn't have done that.' I'm genuinely mortified. Poitier shoots me a refrigerated frown, examining the stool's broken leg. 'No. You did that,' he says. I exaggerate my incredulity: 'Er, did I really do that? Are you absolutely sure there was nothing wrong with the stool? I mean, I'm not that big.' </p> <p>Turning the stool over, Poitier grimaces at the splinters of mahogany that once made up the joist. 'Yes, you definitely did that.' His eyes give me the look of finality. 'I can get it fixed. I'll bill the London Observer,' he pronounces. 'A coupla grand should do it.' I smile meekly, find myself a sofa with all the sturdiness of a Humvee Jeep, and collapse into it. </p> <p>The conversation, logically, begins with his soon to be published memoirs. The Measure of a Man, part-memoir, part-spiritual survey, has all the quiet resilience of Poitier himself. The book's 250-odd pages harbour a quasi-intellectual thesis on modern masculinity - the author finds tools of male potency in family, nature and self-evaluation. He writes: 'I felt called to write about certain values, such as integrity and commitment, faith and forgiveness, about the virtues of simplicity, about the differences between \"amusing ourselves to death\" and finding meaningful pleasures - even joy.'</p> <p>'It isn't the kind of book I could have written at the age of 20,' he says. 'Or even 30. I am what I am. This is the journey that I undertook all those years ago. It has been an incredible journey - I remind myself of that every day. I hope it signals something.' The book is a joy to read, warm-natured and scholarly - The Measure of a Man reinforces the argument that Poitier, indeed, has few peers imbued with a similar gravitas. It also, naturally, embellishes an already extraordinary career.</p> <p>Sidney Poitier was born in 1927 in Miami during a mainland visit by his parents. The infant Poitier weighed only 3lb - his dejected father went to look for a shoebox in which to bury the child. He grew up on Cat Island in the Bahamas, a meagre spit of land 46 miles long and three miles wide. His father, Reginald James Poitier was a tomato farmer who raised six other children. 'It was a land unspoiled by capitalism,' says Poitier. 'We lived off the land - wore cloth sacks. It was the pre-industrial age.'</p> <p>In 1936, keen to resuscitate the domestic market, the state of Florida forced an embargo on tomatoes grown in the Bahamas. The following year, Poitier and his mother set off for Nassau. Reggie Poitier would wrestle a meagre living off an agrarian existence for a further 30 years.</p> <p>Nassau in the 30s was a land of grubby opportunism as a slew of migrants from the Bahamas siphoned a path of cheap labour. It was also Poitier's first introduction to race and class. In The Measure of a Man, he recalls an early experience with white supremacy. Aged 13, Poitier, while walking up West Bay Street, noticed ahead an older white teenager cycling towards him on the opposite pavement. Poitier walked on undeterred - even as the boy steered his bicycle towards him. 'He rode up, and as he got abreast of me he took his right hand off the handlebar and punched me in the face. Boom!'</p> <p>Poitier's awakening to a white-dominant culture became a rivulet of his waking angst. 'I went looking for the cyclist,' Poitier tells me. 'That was my instinctive response. I was not afraid. I was not afraid of this guy who rode up and punched me on the mouth. First, I thought it cowardly. And I was angry, and I went chasing after him. I couldn't find him, though.'</p> <p>The family moved to Miama and Poitier, still in his teens, ran off to New York. He had given up school after only a year and a half of formal education. In New York, and Harlem more specifically (a fabled destination for Southern migrants), Poitier's formative years were defined by a succession of odd jobs - dishwasher, cleaner, construction worker and a year in the US army. The work was unsteady and often dangerous. He slept in bus stations and on pavements. </p> <p>Poitier's first foray into acting was accidental from the outset. In 1945, jobless and politically untutored, he stepped into The American Negro Theatre on 127th Street. His audition was a disaster, but acting drew from him a self-expression he could rarely articulate in the outside world. Regular stage work became a guarantee with theatre tours that wandered throughout the country. In his early roles, such as 1950's No Way Out and 1951's Cry, The Beloved Country, Poitier was the antithesis of Paul Robeson, until then Hollywood's only mainstream black actor. While Robeson championed civil rights and socialism - his vocal attacks led to his eventual blacklisting by Hollywood - Poitier's hip dynamism hinted at the all-American strength of freshly hewn maple.</p> <p>But it was his first mainstream picture The Blackboard Jungle, released in 1955 and based on Evan Hunter's ferocious attack on inner city schooling, that iconised Poitier in the popular consciousness - 45 years later, the film stands as a seminal piece of theatrical cinema. And Poitier, as Gregory W Miller, a juvenile delinquent eventually rehabilitated by Glen Ford, broke all the wider stereotypes of the teenage black threat. The film - decried by Congresswoman Clare Booth Luce as 'un-American' - was released in the same year as the Brown vs Board of Education Supreme Court ruling that unanimously voted in integrated education. </p> <p>'Was I amazed that the film was considered subversive? No, not really,' says Poitier. 'Hollywood hadn't made these kinds of films. The social conscious movement that was creeping up elsewhere hadn't ingrained itself in the film industry yet.'</p> <p>Following The Blackboard Jungle, Poitier relocated to Los Angeles with his wife, Juanita Hardy, consolidating his success with roles in 1957's Edge of the City, 1958's The Defiant Ones (Poitier was the first black actor to be nominated for a Best Actor Academy Award), 1961's Raisin' in the Sun and Lilies of the Field, for which he won an Academy Award in 1963. Before Poitier, black mainstream talent had rarely expressed itself in mainstream cinema. African-American filmmakers shot reels on shoddy budgets, parading their home movies in specialist cinemas. Poitier, young, eloquent and characterising an immaculately tailored sexuality, was a post-war poster boy idolised by suburban housewives. </p> <p>'It was a strange time for me,' says Poitier. Why, I ask? He pauses, fidgeting with his hands, then tells me he spent most of his Hollywood years in psychoanalysis. 'I lived in a country where I couldn't live where I wanted to live. I lived in a country where I couldn't go where I wanted to eat. I lived in a country where I couldn't get a job, except for those put aside for people of my colour or caste.'</p> <p>I was surprised to discover that Poitier, ingrained in the cannon of American cinema for roles displaying fortitude, stoicism and quiet storms, should seek the benefits of counselling. He visited Viola Bernard, the 1968 founder of the American Committee on Psychoanalysis, Community and Society, for 11 years. 'I had to think twice or three times about every step I took,' says Poitier. 'I was in a culture that denied me my very existence. And I had no forces behind me. When I walked the streets outside of 'The Neighbourhood' which I was confined to, I had to be constantly on the alert. The America I am speaking of was a different place back then: the dominant culture did not care about my survival as a human being.'</p> <p>The psychoanalysis also allowed Poitier the emotional foundations with which to tackle an impending divorce. 'My father was very big on marriage. And divorce, I believed, was so stigmatic. So stigmatic. I considered it a failing on my part - a flaw in my character.' Still, the strong characterisation of genre breaking parts continued: A Patch of Blue in 1965, and, in the same year, The Bedford Incident. Never completely a Hollywood insider, Poitier soldiered on for most of the decade, introducing the town to fresh talent like Bill Cosby and Richard Pryor.</p> <p>By the summer of 1968, Poitier held the top three spots on the takings list -To Sir, With Love, co-starring Lulu and Judy Geeson; In the Heat of the Night, with Rod Steiger and Lee Grant; and Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, with Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn. More than 30 years later, In the Heat of the Night, directed by Norman Jewison, is still American cinema's most profound evocation of racial inequality - a dignified portrayal of black and white in shades of grey. As Philadelphian Detective Tibbs, pulled into a murder investigation run by Chief Gillespie (Rod Steiger) in a small town in the Deep South, the film provided Poitier with his most considered screen persona. And the production is now an academic protectorate - both Poitier and Steiger are regular speakers at American symposiums dedicated to the film.</p> <p>'Up until then, you just didn't get that kind of exchange between black and white actors,' commented Steiger, at a Long Island, New York film seminar in the summer of 1998. 'The races in cinema, much as in real life, didn't mix. In the Heat of the Night wasn't just risky cinema: it was a revolution. Suddenly, police brutality, government crackdowns, the civil rights movement - they were all thrown into the American consciousness. Hell, the South hated the film so much it was banned down there.'</p> <p>But as succinctly as Poitier seemed to embody all the aspirational, majestic grandeur of the post-war African-American migrants to the North, he was ostracised by a force as immovable as racism: the counter culture. Black rage annihilated apple-pie America in 1968; over 200 cities burned following the assassinations of Robert F Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. The Democratic National Convention in Chicago was blighted by 500 arrests. And on the West Coast, Huey P Newton's Black Panther Party For Self Defense marched across California, delivering food and soup to the impoverished, arming barrios and projects with the rhetoric of revolt. </p> <p>Meanwhile, at the Mexico Olympics, American athletes Tommy Smith and John Carlos shook black fists of defiance on the medallist's rostrum. White teenage America quickly followed suit, and 'the pukes', as Frank Sinatra dubbed the rock'n'roll generation, took to campus grounds in Paris, London, New York and Los Angeles in a war of political attrition.</p> <p>In The Measure of a Man, Poitier writes: 'There was more than a little dissatisfaction rising up against me in certain corners of the black community The issue boiled down to why I wasn't more angry and confrontational. New voices were speaking for African-Americans, and in new ways. Stokely Carmichael, H Rap Brown, the Black Panthers. According to a certain taste that was coming into ascendancy at the time, I was an 'Uncle Tom', even a 'house Negro', for playing roles that were non-threatening to white audiences, for playing the 'noble Negro' who fulfils white liberal fantasies.'</p> <p>Aware of his diminishing cachet as a leading man, Poitier turned to directing. 'I decided I had to reconfigurate, redesign my career.' He piloted four successful features for Universal Studios: 1972's Buck and the Preacher, 1973's A Warm December, 1975's Let's Do It Again and most memorably, the 1974 screwball comedy Uptown Saturday Night, starring Bill Cosby and Harry Belafonte. Privately, however, Poitier occasionally unveiled a deep-set depression and disillusionment with the film industry. </p> <p>'I viewed him as very much part of the establishment,' says Al Young, scriptwriter for the anarchic 1981 Richard Pryor vehicle Bustin' Loose. Young, now 61, was invited to collaborate with Poitier in 1976 on A Piece of the Action - a film sanctioned by a Universal Studio's sub-division, First Artists International. The baby studio was designed to grant creative control to the Hollywood acting elite - Sidney Poitier, Steve McQueen, Barbara Streisand, Paul Newman and later, Dustin Hoffman. Young remembers: 'Sidney wasn't having a good time. There seemed to be some kind of personal crisis. I was young and radical, definitely one of the Berkeley set. It was the age of rebellion and mass demonstrations. Perhaps Poitier thought some of my hip credentials would rub off on him.'</p> <p>The ethics of cultural dissent - intuitive to Young, then 37 - were new to both Poitier and his characters. And Young eventually withdrew from A Piece of the Action before completion. Almost 25 years later, armed with an engine of charming anecdotes, Young chortles loudly: 'I have memories of a kind and warm man. Someone genuinely dedicated to his craft. But someone, nevertheless, deeply troubled by his fame. It seemed like success, in return, had exacted some horrible price. It's like I remember his Oscar - it was permanently displayed on the floor, keeled over.'</p> <p>Young recalls an incident at the Poitier residence in 1976. 'Sidney always made a big thing out of the fact that he never owned a Rolls-Royce nor a Mercedes. It seemed to keep him in touch with the working classes, so instead,' says Young, laughing, 'he had all these Cadillacs. He displayed a natural empathy towards the working class, but in many ways he was the classic poolside socialist.</p> <p>'Anyway, one day his car breaks down, so he calls the repairman. The guy who showed up was black. He took an instant dislike to Sidney - and treated him with contempt. The look of disgust was unbelievable. It was like Poitier embodied all the evils of someone who had sold out the cause. And Poitier took that very badly. It upset him a great deal.'</p> <p>The popular denunciation of Poitier throughout the late 60s and 70s knew no limits. Black nationalist H Rap Brown deplored his 'Uncle Tom' characterisations. Poitier was more famously immortalised in Amiri Baraka's 1978 play, Sidney Poetical Heroical -a cruel satire that ridiculed the actor as a cheap white liberal gambit on race relations. And three years later, The New York Times published an article, entitled 'Why do white folks love Sidney Poitier so?'</p> <p>'I don't wanna get into that,' Poitier tells me, wringing his hands. 'It's all so deep and so complicated.' His stoicism rarely permits him to elucidate on those barbed attacks. In The Measure of a Man, he notes: 'The heated tempers of that time have long since cooled, and ideological fashions have come and gone.' The line indicates a fractional victory, but better illustrates, on the whole, his seclusion from the counter cultural debate.</p> <p>'He just wasn't of those times,' says Young. 'His was an era of polite gentlemanly etiquette. Hollywood was warming to blaxploitation movies like Shaft. I remember going to his house in 1976, and Sidney and his wife left me in the garden. I sat down on the grass and started reading a copy of Rolling Stone magazine - I was a writer for them. Suddenly, the upstairs window opened and there was Sidney. \"Al,\" he exclaimed. \"What are you doing?\" I told him I was sitting on the grass. \"But we never do that!\" he yelled. \"My God! Can I get you a chair?\"'</p> <p>Later in the afternoon, Poitier, un-prompted, revisits his period of wretchedness. His voice is hushed. In fact, his hands better demonstrate his emotions. 'It was a time when rage had matured to an uncontrollable response,' he breathes. 'The black community had made almost no dent in what was a bogus democracy that said it was a democracy. And the people who looked at my career saw two things. They saw what these liberal white filmmakers were doing, and they loved it. Because it was new and it was saying, \"We are unique.\" The revolutionaries, however, had this convoluted attitude, because it was time for revolution, or whatever. They thought I was too good, too well educated, too refined.' Poitier laughs, and shakes his head. 'Hell, partner,' he winks. 'I couldn't fight that. I didn't even try.' </p> <p>Poitier's wife glides into view from a back room. Joanna Shimkus, 57, is a local TV star in Hollywood; the couple married in 1976. 'Why don't you take the young man out for some lunch? Aren't you hungry, dear?' she tells Poitier. Shimkus wanders off back to the kitchen, through the lounge, idly inspecting Poitier's cultural bric-a-brac. </p> <p>'Sidney?' she exclaims. Poitier rises to his feet, 'Yes, darling?' Shimkus holds up a leg from the stool broken earlier. 'We really do have to get something done about these antique chairs. This one keeps breaking.' </p> <p>I throw a determined glare at Poitier, who blankly stares back. 'You're a damn liar!' I yell. 'Do you have any idea how self-conscious that incident made me feel all afternoon?' Poitier throws his head back and laughs. He slaps me on the knees, 'C'mon kid, let's get some food.'</p> <p>Downstairs at the Sierra Towers's reception desk, Poitier kicks back with the receptionist. 'Isn't she sweet?' he says. He points at me, 'You don't wanna get involved with this guy.' The receptionist, tall, black, lithe, her clothes seemingly lacquered on to her skeleton, giggles and flashes her eyebrows. 'Mr Poitier,' she writhes. 'I'll remember to take your advice.' Poitier glides into his black BMW and the car sails towards Beverly Hills. 'Fuck it, let's have a proper lunch,' he murmurs. At traffic lights, pedestrians stop and squint through his open driver's window. Poitier ignores the squeals of recognition. 'You'll love this restaurant,' he says.</p> <p>Poitier steers the BMW into the car park behind Spago, the renowned Beverley Hills eatery, whose kitchen is directed by celebrity chef Wolfgang Puck. Going past 3pm, we've missed lunch. 'But we might just catch something,' says Poitier. A dim hallway leads us inside, where four waiters sit .around a table, anticipating the evening melee.</p> <p>'Mr Poitier, always good to see you,' cries one. Locally, his name is pronounced 'Poy-tiere'. Another waiter leaps to attention: 'Lunch, Mr Poy-tiere? No problem, let me show you to your favourite table.' We are both hustled into our seats amid a flurry of newly spread tablecovers, fresh napkins and polished crockery. Puck walks by, double-takes, and halts at the table. 'Sidney,' he laughs, fondly. 'Always good to see you. I have a wonderful salad. A dressing to die for.' </p> <p>The lunch is magnificent. Methodically working through a green salad, Poitier says: 'I get offered work these days.' He is currently considering resigning from his post as ambassador to Japan from the Bahamas - he was appointed to the position in 1997. And he last appeared in cinemas in The Jackal, a 1997 remake of the original, starring Bruce Willis. 'But something's always wrong, either the scripts or the directors.' He looks at me: the burden of his 50-year long filmography etched on to his face. He says, 'I have to consider my past, all those other films. Anything after it has to fit in.'</p> <p>We drive back to Sierra Towers and for the first time all day the conversation is conducted by goofy fascinations and trivial interests. Poitier laughs at my accent, and I guffaw at this elderly man's still-intact wonderment of life. 'I think I have an average curiosity,' he admits. He stops the car in front of the apartment block and shakes my hand - there's that firm, diplomatic grip again. 'I guess I'll get that chair fixed now,' he laughs. And Poitier, who signalled in the era of intelligentsia in post-war filmmaking, disappears soundlessly into the building.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/life/story/0,6903,379015,00.html\">Read Philip French's analysis of Poitier's career here</a>.</p> <p>\u0095 The Measure of a Man by Sidney Poitier is published by Simon &amp; Schuster for \u00a316.99.</p>",
  "What are we doing in Stormont? Have we accepted that because we may have lost the military war we must also humiliate ourselves and abandon the political war? Have we accepted that Stormont is now okay, that the RUC is no longer rotten if Patten is implemented, that we are really British after all? Is it not more true to say that we have deluded ourselves and our own people by pretending that we have won a better deal for the working people of Ireland? As a fellow blanket protester has said, all of this is the British Government's alternative to republicanism. Why are we accepting it? <p>I am not advocating dumb militarism or a return to war. Never in the history of republicanism was so much sacrificed and so little gained. I am simply questioning the wisdom of administering British rule in this part of Ireland. I am asking what happened to the struggle in all Ireland - what happened to the idea of a 32-county socialist republic. That was what it was all about. Not about participating in a northern administration that closes hospitals and attacks the teachers' unions. </p> <p>I am asking why we are not fighting for and defending the rights of ordinary working people - for better wages and working conditions. Does 30 years of struggle boil down to a big room at Stormont, Ministerial cars, dark suits and the the Patten Report? </p> <p>What has been shown here is that no matter what nationalist politicians say about all of this they merely spend what the British allow them. Their grasp on political power is no stronger than my grasp on special category status. One morning in January 1978 I was the 'officer in charge of the republican prisoners' in Long Kesh; in the afternoon I was '704 Hughes', by edict of the British Government. In the morning I was a political prisoner, in the afternoon a criminal naked in the H Blocks. The nationalists' power at Stormont, like my clothes, the British consider to be a privilege, to be taken away at any time. </p> <p>It seems now that we have even reached the stage, as in Animal Farm , where some republicans are more equal than others. If the reports from Stormont are correct then it would seem that a senior member of Sinn Fein - who would proclaim himself quite green - has discriminated against other republicans on the false tactical grounds that they 'are too identifiably republican' to be employed in the Sinn Fein Ministries. </p> <p>For 30 years we sought to destroy this hatred and bigotry. The British fed it and bred it. Are we really expected to believe that the British alternative to republicanism - the Good Friday Agreement - will see Britain destroy its own baby? I don't think so. </p> <p>If, as some tell us, a united, just and egalitarian Ireland is so close, why are there still republicans taking up arms and risking their lives in order to achieve it? Are we going to be part of an administration that tortures and interns them? Where will it end? Twenty years ago this month a hunger strike began in the H Blocks of Long Kesh. Twenty years on there are republicans in prison. British troops are still on the streets; the RUC is still there, whether Royal Ulster Constabulary or Patten Ulster Constabulary. </p> <p>Our experience up to now has been humiliating. We have danced to every tune, broke every promise ever made, pursued all the policies we used to term others 'collaborators' for pursuing, and have dressed it up as something progressive in order to deceive our base. Have we merely proved the old adage that the first casualty of war is truth? </p> <p>I understand that articles like this written by people like me cause annoyance to some fellow republicans. But it is my very republicanism that causes me to speak out, just as it did during those years on protest. My republicanism then was legitimate, and is no less legitimate today. Twenty years ago they called me a fenian bastard. I remain an unrepentant fenian bastard. My republicanism and hunger strike were against British rule. I still refuse to conform to it or the views of those administering it. Brendan Hughes was the leader of the 1980 IRA hunger strike in the H-Blocks which started 20 years ago this month</p>",
  "<p>It is a mistake to think of a path as a gap between the things that it leads to, a kind of horticultural no-man's-land. As much as anything else in the garden, it is where the action is. Analyse the paths of a garden and you learn much about the gardener. Are they straight and grid-like, or curving and meandering? Is the planting geared around the paths with flanking avenues, markers at the intersections of other paths and careful gradations of plants working down to the path's edges, or does the path become sublimated into the planting, as it often does in a vegetable patch or in wilder, softer planting schemes? </p> <p>Nothing connects a garden so clearly to the building it belongs to than the paths leading from the house. If they line up with the doors and windows, they immediately impose a symmetry and proportion dictated by the house. I think this is often highly desirable, but it can just as easily be used in reverse to free the garden from the potential restrictions of the house.</p> <p>The first law of any garden path is to get you from A to B. If it is the main route to the compost heap, herb bed or greenhouse, then it wants to be as direct as possible. </p> <p>It is an absolute rule that people will eventually work out the quickest route and use it, even if that means ignoring a beautifully made, dry path to slice diagonally across a muddy lawn or step through a flowerbed. If you don't want this, you must block off the alternatives with impenetrable planting or a more solid barrier. And it is not just humans that this applies to; our dogs, rather weirdly, leave the straight path down to the front door and do a little curving diversion on to the grass, making a worn, doggy groove in winter.</p> <p>It is always a mistake to have a path like a runway taking you down to a point that is visible throughout the whole journey. They must lead to places you cannot see without going to the very end. People who are more interested in plants than gardens tend to assume that one's eyes will be cast down to look at the plants, treating a path rather like a gangway at a flower show. This is nonsense. If you can see everything without progressing from the beginning, then the incentive to move down the path is greatly reduced - however rare the plants along the way. Either the path must curve you round and away from the goal so that you are drawn back to it or else you must take the path through at least one entrance. This might just be a gap in the hedge - the hedge might be there solely to provide the said gap - but some kind of screen there must be.</p> <p>It is not enough just to have paths looking good. They must work, if they are to be used. This is not always easy to get right. When we first moved in eight years ago, I believed that we could simply cut beds from the grass of the field, mow the bits in between and call them paths. It is not a bad policy, if you have limited funds, and half our paths are still just mown field and need only a pass with a mower once a week to keep them that way. I especially like the paths made by cutting the orchard grass at different lengths, with the mown, gently curving strip fringed by the tall meadow grasses. Dead simple, but dead lovely.</p> <p>But grass is useless in the rainy season, which, with the unstoppable roll of global warming, lasts for at least eight months of the year. And even in summer, every time you set foot on the path, let alone wheel a heavy barrow on it, you are compacting the soil down, worsening the drainage and increasing the subsequent winter quagmire.</p> <p>OK, I speak from jaundiced experience, living in one of the wettest places in England with heavy soil to boot, but even the fastest draining ground loses some of its allure after a week's rain in November. Certainly in my own garden, the lovely springy grass paths of summer are just a photo in the book. Feet can't remember them. Going outside to get a sprig of rosemary means taking off your shoes and putting on wellingtons. Only frost brings sufficient hard dryness to walk unprotected.</p> <p>So, over the years, as money and time have allowed, we have been converting our paths from grass to hard surfaces. The luxury of walking dry-shod is worth the work and expense. It also opens up a whole range of colours, textures and structure to the garden. A grass path can somehow hardly be called structural, whereas a brick path is a wall on edge. One of the features of all grand gardens is that they have yards and yards of stone or brick paths. Grand gardens tend to belong to wealthy people, who discovered long ago that if a path is to be any use for most of the year, it must be made of almost anything except grass.</p> <p>So, I have been pouring my enormous wealth into paths. Brick paths, stone paths, gravel paths and cobbled paths. My fortune is invested in paths. The first paths we made were from stone and cobbles. They were intended to be all stone but, after the first few yards, it became apparent that what seemed like a huge pile bought as a random job lot at a knock-down price was not going to do anything like the required stretch. So, we started mixing in cobbles to fill the gaps and make the stone go further. It worked very well, despite the fact that cobbles do not make good paths. They are too knobbly and slippery to walk on with ease. But if you have sufficient stone, they're fine. Cobbles are reasonably cheap to buy and we have dug up loads and used them to edge paths and as a surface barrier in areas where we don't want people to walk.</p> <p>Then we progressed to brick. Sarah had given me the bricks for a path for my 40th birthday. She hunted for ages until she found second-hand bricks from the same brickyard (small, local, closed down in 1884) as those at the back of the house from where the path leads. Choosing bricks that relate to those of the house or any existing walls is the most important aspect of any brick path. It is laid basket-weave fashion and I love it, although the shadiest bit gets incredibly slippery.</p> <p>We then made what I think is our best path. It is very narrow, curves through the spring garden and is made entirely from all the leftover bits and pieces of the first phase of building work. The only consistent materials are concrete blocks laid sideways a block's length apart. The gap between them is infilled with anything that could be used, including quarry tiles, cobbles, bricks and paving stones. The only brief was that no two sections should be alike. In the vegetable garden, we now have brick pavers. These are like bricks, but baked much harder so that they take more wear and tear and, crucially, will not break up when they freeze. The down side is that they are brittle and prone to cracking when you lay them, and they look very new. I don't mind the latter, but we had to look through scores of variations before finding a paver that worked with the existing brick paths.</p> <p>Pavers are not cheap, so we then used them as narrow 'paths-within-a-path' down the centre of some of the grass paths. This is both handsome and practical, as you can mow over them and yet walk and wheel a barrow down the centre in the slushiest of weather. The plan is to continue this throughout the garden. The problem is not just the expense of the pavers but that beneath them is what amounts to a trench 12 to 18in deep, half of which is filled with hardcore, then a generous layer of scalpings tamped down very hard, then a thick layer of sand on which the pavers are laid. If you have very well-drained soil, you won't need such elaborate measures to ensure drainage, but for us it is essential.</p> <p>Our final paths, in the Jewel garden, are topped with a material called Redgra. This is a kind of pink sand with an element of clay that binds it solid when laid. You prepare the path with hardcore and a layer of scalpings, then spread a thin layer of this binding surface which you bang in with a whacker plate. It goes on almost as sand, but after 24 hours it is pretty solid. It is much cheaper and easier to lay than paving or brick, but if it doesn't have really sharp drainage it can get almost muddy in very wet weather and has less integral character.</p> <p>In the end, a path has to work. Feet and wheels must find them easy the year round. But what materials you use will influence the way your garden looks as much as the surrounding planting, so choose well.</p> <p><strong>My roots</strong></p> <p>I finally got round to cutting the box balls last week. Not balls - pebbles. Even I balk at the pretension of this, so will wait a while until their pebbleness manifests itself more obviously than as mere lopsided balls. But they are in an active state of becoming pebbles, and I must admit that this gives me a huge amount of excited pleasure. </p> <p>Once a year, when I cut them, I know for sure that I am doing the right thing. I have put off the job for months - I would normally expect to do it in June - because of the palaver of clearing the clippings up. Not because I am too grand to do that part of the chore, but because the 63 box pebbles are set in cobbles. Geddit? Big, green, living cobbles set in small stone ones. Everything all of a piece. </p> <p>However, the thousands of knobbles of stone make sweeping a nightmare, with box-leaf confetti wedged in the cobbled interstices. So I put off cutting it until I could get hold of a garden vacuum cleaner. I had one years ago and it was useless for me then, in a brand new garden made up of a bare field, dreams and 18in hedges, so I gave it to my father-in-law. But, over the years, I have secretly hankered after a garden vacuum cleaner again and, the other day, I finally got round to hiring one for these box blobs. It worked a treat. Fantastic. </p> <p>The only fly in the ointment was that the electric hedge trimmer decided to stop working while I went for a cup of tea. It worked beautifully until I stopped it and put it down, and then it refused to cut a thing. I fiddled with it for an hour, made it worse, and did the rest with shears. </p> <p>Before I started, I took cuttings from the most vigorous of the box ovoids, lining them out directly into the seed bed in the vegetable garden. I'll keep them cloched over winter and they should form the stock for my plan to line all the vegetable beds with box hedges. I like the idea of these vigorous spheroids spawning sharp-edged boxes of box-edged vegetables.</p> <p>We have had a week of wind and heavy rain, which has bashed the poor garden. Two tepees of Burro d'ingenoli climbing beans blew down in the night, snapping six stout hazel rods in the process. This is not so much due to the force of the wind but the incredible top growth of the beans. </p> <p>I have never seen any like it. They are delicious, too, with a buttery, slippy texture, cooked whole regardless of size. I shall definitely grow more next year.</p>",
  "<p>On Thursday 14 September a man at one of Esso's service stations in Edinburgh climbed up to the forecourt price display to increase the price of petrol. </p> <p>It was the height of the fuel crisis, and the petrol pumps were running dry in the face of the refinery blockade by militant farmer and haulier protesters. </p> <p>Esso's action immediately caused amazement and fury, not just among motorists, but with officials and Ministers co-ordinating civil contingency plans from a bunker under the Cabinet Office just around the corner from Downing Street. </p> <p>The immediate opprobrium sparked what could turn out to be longer-term problems for oil companies. MPs, unions and motoring groups demanded they be punished for this blatant breach of goodwill. Big oil, after all, was benefiting upstream from swollen revenues generated by crude at more than $30 a barrel at the same time as taking advantage of a national emergency downstream. </p> <p>'There was talk that week and since of a windfall tax on oil companies,' said a Whitehall source. Its practicability was 'being considered'. </p> <p>Such a tax now looks less likely, and the Government would be unlikely to make any move until after an election. </p> <p>But the Chancellor's options do not end there. As Gordon Brown readies his pre-Budget report, the discontented argue that the companies' cavalier attitude last month offers an opportunity to move from a narrow focus on fuel duty to a wider review of the taxation of North Sea oil revenues. </p> <p>The Government considered North Sea taxation in 1998, and left it untouched after the companies warned they could scale down investment. But that was when oil was at $10 a barrel. </p> <p>Recent political and economic pressures may force a re-evaluation. </p> <p>In his party conference speech, Tony Blair said: 'Of the 14p rise [in petrol prices] since the Budget last year, 12p has been in the world oil price.' </p> <p>Last week it emerged that rates of return in the North Sea were 33.1 per cent in the second quarter of this year, compared with 6 per cent among UK manufacturers. Analysts indicated oil shareholders were in line for billions in dividends and buybacks. </p> <p>The core protesters resist widening the issue. 'Bringing in the world price is a government public relations trick to distract from its avaricious tax policy,' says Geoff Dossetter, head of external affairs at the Freight Transport Association. They prefer to focus on one simple demand: a 15p cut in fuel excise duty from its current 48p a litre. </p> <p>But the RAC, which last week asked Brown to freeze the duty, also says the companies should shield consumers from swings in the global oil price. It proposes that duty should be reduced progressively to help motorists as the oil price rises within a band between $20 and $30 a barrel. And as that price rises above, say $25, the lost duty should be made up by taxation of the firms' North Sea revenues. </p> <p>'This way the motorist is given a degree of protection, but the burden is spread between the taxpayer and the oil company,' says the RAC's Edmund King. </p> <p>Both these ideas, however, go against the grain of two fundamental planks of government policy. The first is the environmental reason for the duty - its role in preventing carbon emissions. Moreover, if taxes on producers offset duty lost from consumers, corporate profits subsidise consumption, while the Government is unpopular with oil firms. </p> <p>Second, UK oil and fuel taxation policy involves a global oil industry, where capital seeks its highest return from Indonesia to the Gulf of Mexico. </p> <p>Recent history proves the point. One oil analyst says: 'BP played a very hardnosed game over, for example, the Clair field in the North Sea in tax negotiations in 1998.' Prices then were $10 a barrel. </p> <p>Investment confidence since that $10 nadir - which saw nearly 100,000 jobs lost in the North Sea - is slowly reviving. Now BP and other North Sea operators and investors are drawing up future development plans. BP itself has North Sea capital expenditure up from $800 million this year to $1.2 billion next. But companies say they need prices of between $14 to $18 a barrel in the North Sea to make a return. With prices likely to fall, any rise in oil taxes will have to be finely judged. </p> <p>The Government wants high North Sea revenues, which dropped from \u00a33.3bn in 1997-98 to \u00a32.5bn in 1998-99 as the world price of crude fell. These are expected to rebound. </p> <p>It could gain more for taxpayers by increasing the rate or scope of petroleum revenue tax , new field licences or linking tax to rates of return, as in Australia. The problem, however, is that although returns are high at the moment, the North Sea is relatively mature. The reserves left would cost more to exploit. </p> <p>Oil consultancy Wood Mackenzie points to future development and operating costs in the North Sea of $10 a barrel, compared with $5 in Angola and $6 in the Gulf of Mexico. </p> <p>Tax is levied on the revenues companies make minus these costs. For the fields developed before 1982, where royalties and petroleum revenue tax are paid, the rate is 69 per cent. For those developed between then and 1993 it is 65 per cent, and for post-1993 fields the figure is 30 per cent. At current prices this taxable revenue is about $20 a barrel but if, as analysts predict, the price falls to around $21, company margins will fall and the Government's North Sea revenue will drop too. </p> <p>If UK rates are increased, oil companies are already saying life would look better for them elsewhere. Companies say costs are the key, although tax rates in other areas vary. In the Mexican Gulf they are between 35 and 43 per cent for deep water fields; and in Angola between 70 and 75 per cent. </p> <p>But the energy consultant and government adviser, Dieter Helm, says simply that the North Sea is British territory, and Ministers' duty is to maximise licence revenues for taxpayers. </p> <p>Some resources should be preserved for future generations, he adds, and low taxes create incentives for rapacious oil use today. If petrol is too cheap, there is no incentive to find other fuels. </p> <p>Helm believes a thorough overhaul of energy taxation is required. His radicalism is unlikely to be shared in Whitehall. The Government, like the markets, believes the oil price is likely to fall next year, weakening the case for wholesale action. A modest package, including duty cuts for hauliers, is more likely. </p> <p>Last Friday some oil companies cut petrol prices. But the oil majors and independent petrol retailers still claim they are losing money at the pumps, so future prices are unclear. If they rise again, the consequences for the companies' tax bills are anybody's guess.</p>",
  "<p>Vincent Canby, The New York Times's worldly-wise film critic, once wrote of Sidney Poitier that the actor 'does not make movies, he makes milestones'. In the age of Denzel Washington, Wesley Snipes and Chris Rock, Poitier's influence runs the gamut of American cinema. Put simply, the man has few peers. </p> <p>Poitier interviews are a rarity - he has always shrouded his lives, both personal and professional, in secrecy. Now well into the autumn of his life, he takes his place alongside Muhammad Ali, Nelson Mandela and Martin Luther King Jr as one of the 20th century's most eloquent voices on race.</p> <p>Poitier's office, replete with several thousand feet of deep pile carpeting, varnished floorboards, books and paintings, is set within the Sierra Towers apartment block. The building nudges the postcode margins of Beverly Hills and Hollywood. His assistant Marlene greets me at the door of the fifth-floor office - closely followed by Poitier. The actor's apartment is next door. 'Good to see you,' he says, offering up a palsy handshake. He holds a patio door open to a balcony and ushers me out on to a wraparound walkway that leads to his home.</p> <p>Poitier's reception room is congested with furniture - antique Italian, French and African collectables. Stools, mini-tables and chairs compete for every inch of available space. The historical gumbo is impossible to steer a path through, and I tiptoe carefully across the floor. Coffee tables heave under the weight of bric-a-brac: beach pebbles, gilded paperweights, pens, markers, trinkets, timepieces, statuettes and trays filled with loose change and ornamental wood carvings. 'Make yourself at home,' says Poitier. 'We'll get started soon.'</p> <p>As he wanders back on to the balcony to have his photograph taken, I saunter around Poitier's apartment. Next door, a TV room - fitted with pastel-green cupboards - is adorned with books and videos: The Illustrated Twentieth Century, The Green Mile, Heat and his own In the Heat of the Night. </p> <p>A sofa cushion proclaims a blank machismo universal to American marketing, 'If You Want Breakfast in Bed, Then Sleep in the Kitchen'. </p> <p>There are dozens of framed photographs - Bill Cosby and Poitier, Mandela and Poitier, Harry Belafonte and Poitier, a promotional photograph for The Blackboard Jungle, pictures of his six children, and Poitier and his second wife, Joanne Shimkus. A mantelpiece stores numerous awards - a 1963 Nato trophy for 'Star of the Year', the American Film Institute's Lifetime Achievement Award from 1992, and an Oscar for Best Actor, awarded to him in 1963, for Lilies of the Field. </p> <p>While waiting for The Observer's photographer to assemble his photographic equipment, Poitier slides into an armchair by the balcony walkway. 'Sit you doon,' he says, gesturing towards a dinky, gold-lacquered Italian stool nearby. I perch myself on the edge, and we traffic a quick exchange on photography. 'I sometimes like the pictures photographers take of me,' says Poitier. 'I don't know what they see, though,' he adds, thoughtfully. 'What are they looking to capture?'</p> <p>He looks at me and I lean forward to adjust my T-shirt. Only then am I aware of a sinking gravitational pull, augmented by a thwack as the stool gives way. I find myself splayed on the ground, staring at the ceiling, knees bent before me. Rolling over on to my front, neither manfully nor gracefully, I gawk embarrassedly at the extent of my destruction -a broken stool leg lies nearby.</p> <p>Fumble, fumble. 'Was there something defective with the stool? Surely I couldn't have done that.' I'm genuinely mortified. Poitier shoots me a refrigerated frown, examining the stool's broken leg. 'No. You did that,' he says. I exaggerate my incredulity: 'Er, did I really do that? Are you absolutely sure there was nothing wrong with the stool? I mean, I'm not that big.' </p> <p>Turning the stool over, Poitier grimaces at the splinters of mahogany that once made up the joist. 'Yes, you definitely did that.' His eyes give me the look of finality. 'I can get it fixed. I'll bill the London Observer,' he pronounces. 'A coupla grand should do it.' I smile meekly, find myself a sofa with all the sturdiness of a Humvee Jeep, and collapse into it. </p> <p>The conversation, logically, begins with his soon to be published memoirs. The Measure of a Man, part-memoir, part-spiritual survey, has all the quiet resilience of Poitier himself. The book's 250-odd pages harbour a quasi-intellectual thesis on modern masculinity - the author finds tools of male potency in family, nature and self-evaluation. He writes: 'I felt called to write about certain values, such as integrity and commitment, faith and forgiveness, about the virtues of simplicity, about the differences between \"amusing ourselves to death\" and finding meaningful pleasures - even joy.'</p> <p>'It isn't the kind of book I could have written at the age of 20,' he says. 'Or even 30. I am what I am. This is the journey that I undertook all those years ago. It has been an incredible journey - I remind myself of that every day. I hope it signals something.' The book is a joy to read, warm-natured and scholarly - The Measure of a Man reinforces the argument that Poitier, indeed, has few peers imbued with a similar gravitas. It also, naturally, embellishes an already extraordinary career.</p> <p>Sidney Poitier was born in 1927 in Miami during a mainland visit by his parents. The infant Poitier weighed only 3lb - his dejected father went to look for a shoebox in which to bury the child. He grew up on Cat Island in the Bahamas, a meagre spit of land 46 miles long and three miles wide. His father, Reginald James Poitier was a tomato farmer who raised six other children. 'It was a land unspoiled by capitalism,' says Poitier. 'We lived off the land - wore cloth sacks. It was the pre-industrial age.'</p> <p>In 1936, keen to resuscitate the domestic market, the state of Florida forced an embargo on tomatoes grown in the Bahamas. The following year, Poitier and his mother set off for Nassau. Reggie Poitier would wrestle a meagre living off an agrarian existence for a further 30 years.</p> <p>Nassau in the 30s was a land of grubby opportunism as a slew of migrants from the Bahamas siphoned a path of cheap labour. It was also Poitier's first introduction to race and class. In The Measure of a Man, he recalls an early experience with white supremacy. Aged 13, Poitier, while walking up West Bay Street, noticed ahead an older white teenager cycling towards him on the opposite pavement. Poitier walked on undeterred - even as the boy steered his bicycle towards him. 'He rode up, and as he got abreast of me he took his right hand off the handlebar and punched me in the face. Boom!'</p> <p>Poitier's awakening to a white-dominant culture became a rivulet of his waking angst. 'I went looking for the cyclist,' Poitier tells me. 'That was my instinctive response. I was not afraid. I was not afraid of this guy who rode up and punched me on the mouth. First, I thought it cowardly. And I was angry, and I went chasing after him. I couldn't find him, though.'</p> <p>The family moved to Miama and Poitier, still in his teens, ran off to New York. He had given up school after only a year and a half of formal education. In New York, and Harlem more specifically (a fabled destination for Southern migrants), Poitier's formative years were defined by a succession of odd jobs - dishwasher, cleaner, construction worker and a year in the US army. The work was unsteady and often dangerous. He slept in bus stations and on pavements. </p> <p>Poitier's first foray into acting was accidental from the outset. In 1945, jobless and politically untutored, he stepped into The American Negro Theatre on 127th Street. His audition was a disaster, but acting drew from him a self-expression he could rarely articulate in the outside world. Regular stage work became a guarantee with theatre tours that wandered throughout the country. In his early roles, such as 1950's No Way Out and 1951's Cry, The Beloved Country, Poitier was the antithesis of Paul Robeson, until then Hollywood's only mainstream black actor. While Robeson championed civil rights and socialism - his vocal attacks led to his eventual blacklisting by Hollywood - Poitier's hip dynamism hinted at the all-American strength of freshly hewn maple.</p> <p>But it was his first mainstream picture The Blackboard Jungle, released in 1955 and based on Evan Hunter's ferocious attack on inner city schooling, that iconised Poitier in the popular consciousness - 45 years later, the film stands as a seminal piece of theatrical cinema. And Poitier, as Gregory W Miller, a juvenile delinquent eventually rehabilitated by Glen Ford, broke all the wider stereotypes of the teenage black threat. The film - decried by Congresswoman Clare Booth Luce as 'un-American' - was released in the same year as the Brown vs Board of Education Supreme Court ruling that unanimously voted in integrated education. </p> <p>'Was I amazed that the film was considered subversive? No, not really,' says Poitier. 'Hollywood hadn't made these kinds of films. The social conscious movement that was creeping up elsewhere hadn't ingrained itself in the film industry yet.'</p> <p>Following The Blackboard Jungle, Poitier relocated to Los Angeles with his wife, Juanita Hardy, consolidating his success with roles in 1957's Edge of the City, 1958's The Defiant Ones (Poitier was the first black actor to be nominated for a Best Actor Academy Award), 1961's Raisin' in the Sun and Lilies of the Field, for which he won an Academy Award in 1963. Before Poitier, black mainstream talent had rarely expressed itself in mainstream cinema. African-American filmmakers shot reels on shoddy budgets, parading their home movies in specialist cinemas. Poitier, young, eloquent and characterising an immaculately tailored sexuality, was a post-war poster boy idolised by suburban housewives. </p> <p>'It was a strange time for me,' says Poitier. Why, I ask? He pauses, fidgeting with his hands, then tells me he spent most of his Hollywood years in psychoanalysis. 'I lived in a country where I couldn't live where I wanted to live. I lived in a country where I couldn't go where I wanted to eat. I lived in a country where I couldn't get a job, except for those put aside for people of my colour or caste.'</p> <p>I was surprised to discover that Poitier, ingrained in the cannon of American cinema for roles displaying fortitude, stoicism and quiet storms, should seek the benefits of counselling. He visited Viola Bernard, the 1968 founder of the American Committee on Psychoanalysis, Community and Society, for 11 years. 'I had to think twice or three times about every step I took,' says Poitier. 'I was in a culture that denied me my very existence. And I had no forces behind me. When I walked the streets outside of 'The Neighbourhood' which I was confined to, I had to be constantly on the alert. The America I am speaking of was a different place back then: the dominant culture did not care about my survival as a human being.'</p> <p>The psychoanalysis also allowed Poitier the emotional foundations with which to tackle an impending divorce. 'My father was very big on marriage. And divorce, I believed, was so stigmatic. So stigmatic. I considered it a failing on my part - a flaw in my character.' Still, the strong characterisation of genre breaking parts continued: A Patch of Blue in 1965, and, in the same year, The Bedford Incident. Never completely a Hollywood insider, Poitier soldiered on for most of the decade, introducing the town to fresh talent like Bill Cosby and Richard Pryor.</p> <p>By the summer of 1968, Poitier held the top three spots on the takings list -To Sir, With Love, co-starring Lulu and Judy Geeson; In the Heat of the Night, with Rod Steiger and Lee Grant; and Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, with Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn. More than 30 years later, In the Heat of the Night, directed by Norman Jewison, is still American cinema's most profound evocation of racial inequality - a dignified portrayal of black and white in shades of grey. As Philadelphian Detective Tibbs, pulled into a murder investigation run by Chief Gillespie (Rod Steiger) in a small town in the Deep South, the film provided Poitier with his most considered screen persona. And the production is now an academic protectorate - both Poitier and Steiger are regular speakers at American symposiums dedicated to the film.</p> <p>'Up until then, you just didn't get that kind of exchange between black and white actors,' commented Steiger, at a Long Island, New York film seminar in the summer of 1998. 'The races in cinema, much as in real life, didn't mix. In the Heat of the Night wasn't just risky cinema: it was a revolution. Suddenly, police brutality, government crackdowns, the civil rights movement - they were all thrown into the American consciousness. Hell, the South hated the film so much it was banned down there.'</p> <p>But as succinctly as Poitier seemed to embody all the aspirational, majestic grandeur of the post-war African-American migrants to the North, he was ostracised by a force as immovable as racism: the counter culture. Black rage annihilated apple-pie America in 1968; over 200 cities burned following the assassinations of Robert F Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. The Democratic National Convention in Chicago was blighted by 500 arrests. And on the West Coast, Huey P Newton's Black Panther Party For Self Defense marched across California, delivering food and soup to the impoverished, arming barrios and projects with the rhetoric of revolt. </p> <p>Meanwhile, at the Mexico Olympics, American athletes Tommy Smith and John Carlos shook black fists of defiance on the medallist's rostrum. White teenage America quickly followed suit, and 'the pukes', as Frank Sinatra dubbed the rock'n'roll generation, took to campus grounds in Paris, London, New York and Los Angeles in a war of political attrition.</p> <p>In The Measure of a Man, Poitier writes: 'There was more than a little dissatisfaction rising up against me in certain corners of the black community The issue boiled down to why I wasn't more angry and confrontational. New voices were speaking for African-Americans, and in new ways. Stokely Carmichael, H Rap Brown, the Black Panthers. According to a certain taste that was coming into ascendancy at the time, I was an 'Uncle Tom', even a 'house Negro', for playing roles that were non-threatening to white audiences, for playing the 'noble Negro' who fulfils white liberal fantasies.'</p> <p>Aware of his diminishing cachet as a leading man, Poitier turned to directing. 'I decided I had to reconfigurate, redesign my career.' He piloted four successful features for Universal Studios: 1972's Buck and the Preacher, 1973's A Warm December, 1975's Let's Do It Again and most memorably, the 1974 screwball comedy Uptown Saturday Night, starring Bill Cosby and Harry Belafonte. Privately, however, Poitier occasionally unveiled a deep-set depression and disillusionment with the film industry. </p> <p>'I viewed him as very much part of the establishment,' says Al Young, scriptwriter for the anarchic 1981 Richard Pryor vehicle Bustin' Loose. Young, now 61, was invited to collaborate with Poitier in 1976 on A Piece of the Action - a film sanctioned by a Universal Studio's sub-division, First Artists International. The baby studio was designed to grant creative control to the Hollywood acting elite - Sidney Poitier, Steve McQueen, Barbara Streisand, Paul Newman and later, Dustin Hoffman. Young remembers: 'Sidney wasn't having a good time. There seemed to be some kind of personal crisis. I was young and radical, definitely one of the Berkeley set. It was the age of rebellion and mass demonstrations. Perhaps Poitier thought some of my hip credentials would rub off on him.'</p> <p>The ethics of cultural dissent - intuitive to Young, then 37 - were new to both Poitier and his characters. And Young eventually withdrew from A Piece of the Action before completion. Almost 25 years later, armed with an engine of charming anecdotes, Young chortles loudly: 'I have memories of a kind and warm man. Someone genuinely dedicated to his craft. But someone, nevertheless, deeply troubled by his fame. It seemed like success, in return, had exacted some horrible price. It's like I remember his Oscar - it was permanently displayed on the floor, keeled over.'</p> <p>Young recalls an incident at the Poitier residence in 1976. 'Sidney always made a big thing out of the fact that he never owned a Rolls-Royce nor a Mercedes. It seemed to keep him in touch with the working classes, so instead,' says Young, laughing, 'he had all these Cadillacs. He displayed a natural empathy towards the working class, but in many ways he was the classic poolside socialist.</p> <p>'Anyway, one day his car breaks down, so he calls the repairman. The guy who showed up was black. He took an instant dislike to Sidney - and treated him with contempt. The look of disgust was unbelievable. It was like Poitier embodied all the evils of someone who had sold out the cause. And Poitier took that very badly. It upset him a great deal.'</p> <p>The popular denunciation of Poitier throughout the late 60s and 70s knew no limits. Black nationalist H Rap Brown deplored his 'Uncle Tom' characterisations. Poitier was more famously immortalised in Amiri Baraka's 1978 play, Sidney Poetical Heroical -a cruel satire that ridiculed the actor as a cheap white liberal gambit on race relations. And three years later, The New York Times published an article, entitled 'Why do white folks love Sidney Poitier so?'</p> <p>'I don't wanna get into that,' Poitier tells me, wringing his hands. 'It's all so deep and so complicated.' His stoicism rarely permits him to elucidate on those barbed attacks. In The Measure of a Man, he notes: 'The heated tempers of that time have long since cooled, and ideological fashions have come and gone.' The line indicates a fractional victory, but better illustrates, on the whole, his seclusion from the counter cultural debate.</p> <p>'He just wasn't of those times,' says Young. 'His was an era of polite gentlemanly etiquette. Hollywood was warming to blaxploitation movies like Shaft. I remember going to his house in 1976, and Sidney and his wife left me in the garden. I sat down on the grass and started reading a copy of Rolling Stone magazine - I was a writer for them. Suddenly, the upstairs window opened and there was Sidney. \"Al,\" he exclaimed. \"What are you doing?\" I told him I was sitting on the grass. \"But we never do that!\" he yelled. \"My God! Can I get you a chair?\"'</p> <p>Later in the afternoon, Poitier, un-prompted, revisits his period of wretchedness. His voice is hushed. In fact, his hands better demonstrate his emotions. 'It was a time when rage had matured to an uncontrollable response,' he breathes. 'The black community had made almost no dent in what was a bogus democracy that said it was a democracy. And the people who looked at my career saw two things. They saw what these liberal white filmmakers were doing, and they loved it. Because it was new and it was saying, \"We are unique.\" The revolutionaries, however, had this convoluted attitude, because it was time for revolution, or whatever. They thought I was too good, too well educated, too refined.' Poitier laughs, and shakes his head. 'Hell, partner,' he winks. 'I couldn't fight that. I didn't even try.' </p> <p>Poitier's wife glides into view from a back room. Joanna Shimkus, 57, is a local TV star in Hollywood; the couple married in 1976. 'Why don't you take the young man out for some lunch? Aren't you hungry, dear?' she tells Poitier. Shimkus wanders off back to the kitchen, through the lounge, idly inspecting Poitier's cultural bric-a-brac. </p> <p>'Sidney?' she exclaims. Poitier rises to his feet, 'Yes, darling?' Shimkus holds up a leg from the stool broken earlier. 'We really do have to get something done about these antique chairs. This one keeps breaking.' </p> <p>I throw a determined glare at Poitier, who blankly stares back. 'You're a damn liar!' I yell. 'Do you have any idea how self-conscious that incident made me feel all afternoon?' Poitier throws his head back and laughs. He slaps me on the knees, 'C'mon kid, let's get some food.'</p> <p>Downstairs at the Sierra Towers's reception desk, Poitier kicks back with the receptionist. 'Isn't she sweet?' he says. He points at me, 'You don't wanna get involved with this guy.' The receptionist, tall, black, lithe, her clothes seemingly lacquered on to her skeleton, giggles and flashes her eyebrows. 'Mr Poitier,' she writhes. 'I'll remember to take your advice.' Poitier glides into his black BMW and the car sails towards Beverly Hills. 'Fuck it, let's have a proper lunch,' he murmurs. At traffic lights, pedestrians stop and squint through his open driver's window. Poitier ignores the squeals of recognition. 'You'll love this restaurant,' he says.</p> <p>Poitier steers the BMW into the car park behind Spago, the renowned Beverley Hills eatery, whose kitchen is directed by celebrity chef Wolfgang Puck. Going past 3pm, we've missed lunch. 'But we might just catch something,' says Poitier. A dim hallway leads us inside, where four waiters sit .around a table, anticipating the evening melee.</p> <p>'Mr Poitier, always good to see you,' cries one. Locally, his name is pronounced 'Poy-tiere'. Another waiter leaps to attention: 'Lunch, Mr Poy-tiere? No problem, let me show you to your favourite table.' We are both hustled into our seats amid a flurry of newly spread tablecovers, fresh napkins and polished crockery. Puck walks by, double-takes, and halts at the table. 'Sidney,' he laughs, fondly. 'Always good to see you. I have a wonderful salad. A dressing to die for.' </p> <p>The lunch is magnificent. Methodically working through a green salad, Poitier says: 'I get offered work these days.' He is currently considering resigning from his post as ambassador to Japan from the Bahamas - he was appointed to the position in 1997. And he last appeared in cinemas in The Jackal, a 1997 remake of the original, starring Bruce Willis. 'But something's always wrong, either the scripts or the directors.' He looks at me: the burden of his 50-year long filmography etched on to his face. He says, 'I have to consider my past, all those other films. Anything after it has to fit in.'</p> <p>We drive back to Sierra Towers and for the first time all day the conversation is conducted by goofy fascinations and trivial interests. Poitier laughs at my accent, and I guffaw at this elderly man's still-intact wonderment of life. 'I think I have an average curiosity,' he admits. He stops the car in front of the apartment block and shakes my hand - there's that firm, diplomatic grip again. 'I guess I'll get that chair fixed now,' he laughs. And Poitier, who signalled in the era of intelligentsia in post-war filmmaking, disappears soundlessly into the building.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.filmunlimited.co.uk/features/featurepages/0,4120,379043,00.html\">Read Philip French's analysis of Poitier's career here</a>.</p> <p>\u0095 The Measure of a Man by Sidney Poitier is published by Simon &amp; Schuster for \u00a316.99.</p>",
  "<p>On the tenth anniversary of the creation of the internet, the British scientist who invented the world wide web has called for the abolition of censorship online. As parents' groups and politicians press for new ways to police websites, Tim Berners-Lee rejects censorship as 'horrific'. </p> <p>In an exclusive interview with The Observer , Berners-Lee dismisses the recent outcry over paedophiles targeting youngsters in web chatrooms, child pornography and fraud, and rejects calls for a 'net regulator'. 'I know there are some very strong feelings but you can not banish technology or regulate content. </p> <p>'Regulation is censorship - one grown-up telling another what they can and cannot do or see. For me, the idea is horrific. Universality is the key. You must be able to represent anything on the web.' </p> <p>Illegal material - child pornography, 'video nasties' - should remain illegal, but he insists 'the world is a diverse place and we should trust people, not try to police them... There are many cultures and they are continually changing. What somebody in Tennessee might think of as reasonable when it comes to nudity is very different from what someone in Finland might think. </p> <p>'Two neighbours next door to each-other might have very different ideas. So any attempt to make a global centralised standard is going to be unbelievably contentious. You can't do that.' </p> <p>Instead of regulation it is up to parents to 'catch up' with the new e- generation and teach youngsters how to use the web safely. Children are at risk because they are 'technologically ahead of most grown-ups, who have to ask the younger generation how to turn the thing on and get it working. Adults are slower than children. They need to catch up so they can teach their children what to see and what to avoid.' </p> <p>Ten years ago Berners-Lee wrote the electronic code that enables computers across the world to 'talk' to each-other down a telephone line. The internet was born and has grown from a single website to more than 800,000,000, with e-commerce, chatrooms and email transforming the way we work, shop, do business, socialise and relax. </p> <p>The Manchester-born scientist has been hailed as 'the man who invented the future'. A decade on he says we are still 'just scratching the surface' of what the internet can do. 'The web is far from done. Just imagine you were back in the Middle Ages and somebody asked \"Given the full impact that paper is going to have, where will we be?\" That's where we are.' </p> <p>He describes the future as 'the semantic web... a new, more powerful interactive network that will really enable e-commerce and industry to hum. But I don't want to say more or everyone will jump on the bandwagon and that will wreck it.' </p> <p>He says his creation is 'progressing remarkably well... it's neat. It is an achievement of a group of people who had a twinkle in their eye about a possible future. We should celebrate the fact that we can change the world by creating a new social tool. It gives a great feeling of hope that we can do it again.' </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:john.arlidge@observer.co.uk\">john.arlidge@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>British scientists are preparing to listen to the heartbeat of stars in a bold bid to find thousands of Earth-like worlds in our galaxy. </p> <p>Astronomers in the UK have backed a \u00a3200m global project, named Eddington, which is to be approved by the European Space Agency (Esa) this week. The Eddington satellite will survey more than half a million stars, analyse each one's behaviour and pinpoint those with worlds like ours. </p> <p>At least a thousand 'Earths' are expected to be found during Eddington's two-year lifetime. Each will then be surveyed by a second wave of probes carrying spectroscopic analysers that will determine if atmospheres contain traces of substances made by living creatures. </p> <p>'This is our first real step to answer the simple, fundamental question: are we alone in the universe?' said astronomer Dr Gerry Gilmore, a member of the project team. </p> <p>The mission is one of six Esa projects to be announced on Friday that will form the agency's scientific programme for the next decade. Others include a probe that will land on the searing plains of Mercury, closest planet to the Sun, and a star-survey mission, called Gaia, that will also pinpoint asteroids heading towards Earth. </p> <p>The Eddington mission - named after the distinguished UK scientist Sir Arthur Eddington - will attempt a far stranger task: it will listen to the sounds of the stars. 'Our own Sun rings like bells,' said Dr Paul Murdin, of the British National Space Centre. 'It pulses and makes a noise as it does so. We can't hear the sounds, but we can see minuscule oscillations in the Sun's brightness every few minutes.' </p> <p>The Eddington probe is designed to detect such oscillations in other stars, valuable information about their internal structures. However, these observations will also be crucial in detecting any attendant planets. 'This probe is designed to do one extremely boring task,' said Gilmore, of the Institute of Astronomy in Cambridge. 'It will sit in space and peer at the same little bit of sky for weeks on end. It will take a high-resolution photograph every few seconds, creating a high-precision video movie of about 50,000 stars. This film will be analysed for tiny variations - of around one part in a million - in brightness in each star. When we witness such fluctuations, we will know there are only two possible causes. Some will be the result of the star shaking like a jelly - just as our Sun does - and this will provide us with key data about its internal structure. However, sometimes a larger dip in its light output will occur - when a planet passes in front of it.' </p> <p>The Eddington mission - scheduled for launch in 2009 - will last two years, scouring one patch of sky every few months, in the most promising parts of our galaxy. It is expected to find thousands of planets, but only planets like Earth will be followed up. 'We are only interested in \"Goldilocks\" worlds,' says Gilmore. 'These are planets that are not too far from their own sun and therefore too cold to sustain life, or too close and therefore too hot, to allow creatures to evolve. Temperature is crucial. It has got to be just right.' </p> <p>Only these planets can produce liquid water, the one substance necessary for living things on Earth. 'Once the locations of these worlds have been discovered, we will think about ways of finding out if they actually possess water, and if they betray evidence that life has evolved on them,' added Murdin. </p> <p>'The most likely method will be to create satellites that carry devices called infero-meters to detect spectral signatures of chemicals like methane in atmospheres. These substances are only made by living creatures. From deep space, the most obvious sign of life on Earth is cows' flatulence. </p> <p>'If we find out that this stuff exists on another world, we will have found out that we are not alone. What we do next is anybody's guess.' </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.esrin.esa.it/\">www.esrin.esa.it/</a> European Space Agency's site</p>",
  "What will happen to the peace dividend if the new power-sharing executive in Belfast collapses? As David Trimble fights for his political life, business leaders fear that Northern Ireland's economic recovery will be put at risk if the new devolved institutions are seen to falter. <p>Since the Belfast Agreement was signed in 1998, economic progress has been dramatic. The so-called peace dividend is immediately visible in the scale of new buildings - hotels, office blocks, shopping centres. </p> <p>The Waterfront Hall where David Trimble met the critics within his own party yesterday is a symbol of how things have changed. The airy building stands beside the River Lagan alongside the recently built Hilton Hotel. </p> <p>It is sometimes hard to remember that only a few years ago people were searched as they entered shops and restaurants in Belfast. The official statistics confirm the gains that have been made as a result of the peace process. Once an unemployment black spot, the jobless rate in Northern Ireland is now running below the European Union average. There has been steady success in attracting foreign investment, particularly in hi-tech industries. </p> <p>There are still big problems to be tackled. Northern Ireland's traditional manufacturing industries like shipbuilding are in decline. New jobs will be needed to replace those lost in the police and security firms. These will require people to have different skills, something that can only be achieved by retraining and education. </p> <p>The new assembly at Stormont is currently debating Strategy 2010, an ambitious economic plan which aims to raise Northern Ireland's GDP to 90 per cent of the UK average over the next 10 years. This is a serious consideration of long-term strategy which is far removed from the rancorous scenes when political leaders trade insults over the peace process. </p> <p>But economic progress will be put at risk if the political institutions like the Assembly are seen to falter. Peace isn't just a matter of lack of violence on the streets although this is obviously necessary to persuade multi-national companies to invest. </p> <p>Political stability and a sense that Northern Ireland's leaders are ready and able to take control of the economy are also necessary. So George Quigley, Chairman of Ulster Bank and one of the province's most respected businessmen, believes that the role of the Assembly is vital in deciding policy and ensuring that economic targets are achieved. He points to the role which political leaders 'and an almost obsessive drive for economic growth' have played in shaping the success of the Republic's economy. </p> <p>This has been missing in Northern Ireland for obvious reasons. Direct rule has meant that local politicians have lacked the clout to lobby effectively in the corridors of power. Thirty years of violence have taken a very heavy toll on the infrastructure. The province benefits from transfers of \u00a36 billion from the British Exchequer, but Northern Ireland has been unable to match the tax incentives which have brought foreign investors to the Republic and this will only change if the Treasury can be persuaded, by local politicians, that the province needs special consideration. </p> <p>Some of the problems remain outside the control of the local politicians, but many important decisions on funding for education, the environment, health and so on are being taken by local Ministers at Stormont. Peter Mandelson, the Northern Ireland Secretary, has warned that the flow of investment and economic benefits that have been a result of the Good Friday Agreement could slow down if the peace process continues to lurch from crisis to crisis. </p> <p>The emphasis in the media over the next few weeks, as unionists for and against the Belfast Agreement argue over Trimble's future, will be on bitterly divisive issues like policing and the handover of IRA weapons. Hospital closures, the threat to Belfast shipbuilders Harland &amp; Wolff and the debate on the 11+ exam will hardly rate a mention. These are issues of huge importance to most of the people in Northern Ireland, and they would like to see decisions on them being made by local politicians. That opportunity will be lost if the executive collapses.</p>"
