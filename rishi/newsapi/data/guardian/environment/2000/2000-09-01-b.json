  "<p>When Derek Walcott was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature in 1992 the citation said he was honoured \"for a poetic oeuvre of great luminosity, sustained by a historical vision, the outcome of a multicultural commitment.\" </p> <p> This vision and commitment were forged in the extraordinary cultural melting pot that is the Caribbean. There is English, Dutch, Creole and African all represented within two generations of his lineage. He was brought up in a British colony as an English-speaking Methodist, but St Lucia was mostly a Creole-speaking Catholic island. In social terms he was from an intellectual elite, while economically he was harshly poor. Black and white have of course played a big part in Walcott's life, but it is the colours in between that have defined the man and his work. Or as he put it in his 1979 autobiographical poem The Schooner Flight: </p> <p> I'm just a red nigger who love the sea, <br> I had a sound colonial education, I have Dutch, nigger and English in me, <br> and either I'm nobody, or I'm a nation. </p> <p>The writer Marina Warner first saw Walcott at a reading in a former 18th-century prison in Dublin. \"He read a section of his poem Omeros where a woman opens a box and the whole of the empire spills out in these rolling stanzas packed with colonial symbolism,\" she recalls. \"Derek was surrounded by portraits of Lord Lieutenants of Ireland in their uniforms and medals. To see him reading these lines there, in his wonderful, rumbling Paul Robeson style of delivery, was a marvellous moment. It really was history talking back.\" </p> <p>Warner points out that he is simultaneously a profound critic of how the Caribbean has been treated by empire but is also very aware of the cultural legacy and riches that connection brings. \"He operates within this interesting contradiction all the time. He has a white grandfather and has green eyes. He is the patchwork quilt of the Caribbean.\" </p> <p>The novelist Caryl Phillips claims that Walcott \"has shown that there is a sense of what I would call 'big history' in the region, rather than seeing it as a set of scattered islands off the United States where small history happens. This is a place where much larger forces are at work.\" </p> <p>Poet David Dabydeen, who like Phillips was born in the region, notes that Walcott's approval for things like his \"sound colonial education\" can make him unpopular with \"people who believe in an easy flag-waving and drum-beating nationalism\". But while his work combines forms from English, Russian and Greek poetry, it also contains Caribbean rhythms and sensibility, explains Dabydeen. \"He shows that the seemingly diverse traditions of Creole and Mediterranean are not so diverse after all. The fact is that Europe is there in the form of the English, the Spanish, the French and the Dutch.\" </p> <p>Walcott's latest work, the 160-page poem Tiepolo's Hound, is another boldly ambitious explication of the synthesis between the Caribbean and the western world. It tells the story of the impressionist painter Camille Pissaro, a Sephardic Jew who was brought up on the Caribbean island of St Thomas, went to France in his mid-20s and helped to change the face of European art. The poem also tells the story of Walcott, another outsider and artist working against the prevailing fashions who left his Caribbean home to pursue his visions. </p> <p>As a young man Walcott considered being a professional painter, and the poem is illustrated with his work. \"But the text does says how hard I find painting and how much of it is failure,\" he quickly explains. \"It's not saying here's Pissaro and here's me. But it does show the relationship between the writing and the painting.\" </p> <p>Walcott covers some interesting art historical ground and makes a good case that Pissaro's wintry depictions of Paris are infused with Caribbean colouring. But it is the key question of why Pissaro chose to leave the region that most preoccupies him. It is quintessential Walcott material. </p> <p>\"There was no reason why he should have stayed in St Thomas,\" he says. \"If it is possible to feel bored and restless with contemporary St Thomas, imagine how it felt 150 years ago. Of course there's the business of him being white and Jewish, and it may be an anachronistic question or the wrong question about the wrong time. But I am still interested in the idea of why he went. I wonder whether painting that landscape and the black faces was ever a real choice for him. Was it considered a proper subject or was that at the time completely out of the question.\" </p> <p>Bruce King has written a major biography of Walcott that will be published by Oxford University Press in October. In Tiepolo's Hound, he sees Walcott again putting the West Indies at the centre of history rather than tangential to it. \"This is the real difference between him and Naipaul. Naipaul sees Trinidad as a backwater and Derek says, 'No, we are part of world culture. A lot of things have happened here.' Just because they don't have an economic base it will always be difficult to talk about West Indian independence, and perhaps it will always be a colony in an economic sense. But culturally it is amazing what has been produced there. And this is what he sees himself contributing to. To dismiss it all like Naipaul does is absurd.\" </p> <p>According to Caryl Phillips, Walcott has, almost single-handedly, created a poetic tradition in the Caribbean. That has been both a help and a hindrance to him. \"If you are working in the shadow of Yeats or Wordsworth you always have someone to measure yourself against. You are not on what Heaney calls 'a peasant's pilgrimage'. But Derek didn't have that comforting notion that there had been people before him. It makes what he has done even more remarkable.\" </p> <p>Dabydeen says Walcott's impact on the status of Caribbean writing has been profound. \"When he won the Nobel Prize in 1992 we all won the Nobel Prize. The symbolism of this on the 500th anniversary of Columbus's arrival in the region was immense. There is enormous local pride. There is a fish cake named after him in St Lucia, Columbus Square is now Walcott Square, and he carries all this with a great deal of the humility.\" </p> <p>In a sense Walcott was born into the cultural officer class of the region. His people were the teachers, preachers and local administrators. His father, Warwick Walcott, was a civil servant working for the attorney general. He was an opera fan, had a sizeable library, wrote poetry and painted. He was a significant figure in the local artistic scene and had set up a literary society and staged plays.</p> <p> His mother, Alix, was a headmistress. Derek and his twin brother Roderick, a theatre director who died earlier this year, were born in the largest town in St Lucia, Castries, in 1930. They had one older sister. Their father died when the boys were aged one, leaving his wife to bring up the children during a depression. Alix Walcott was an extremely forceful woman and very well read. Walcott remembers her singing Methodist hymns around the house and reciting great chunks of poetry and prose. \"Things like Cardinal Wolsey's farewell speech. She knew a lot of Portia's speeches and had played her in a production put on by my father. She was a real ham and a performer, and I always hoped that one day she would recite something of mine like that.\" </p> <p>In order to provide for the family she took in sewing work, but Walcott says he wasn't conscious of any deprivation. \"My mother hid the struggle from us children. She complained about her salary and she had a tough time. Although she became a headmistress she still had to do a lot of sewing. The more I think about her the more remarkable I realise she was. And she understood straight away when I said that I wanted to write.\" Walcott was also encouraged at his school, St Mary's College, by some of the younger teachers and the headmaster. \"They made me feel that this is what I should do. The headmaster asked to read one of my poems at some celebration or other when I was about 10. When I look back that is phenomenal encouragement.\" By the age of 14 his precocity had sparked an island row when a priest accused him of heresy after one of his poems, which said that God could be better found through nature than through preaching, was published in the local newspaper. </p> <p>Walcott's education was, apart from its location, identical to that of middle-class children in England at the time, and the travel writer Patrick Leigh Fermor, who visited the school in the early 50s, noted that \"it had a completely English atmosphere\". Astonishingly this tiny island school has produced two Nobel Prize winners, Walcott and the 1979 economics laureate Sir Arthur Lewis. Coincidentally they were both born on January 23. </p> <p>Walcott just missed out on the island scholarship to Oxford because he was bad at mathematics and so went to the University of the West Indies in Jamaica, where he studied French, Latin and Spanish. \"I don't know what would have happened to me as a writer if I had gone to England and shaped my life out of England. Of course I will never know, but I think I prefer what did happen.\" He says had a terrific time at university but didn't do any work, preferring to spend his time in the drama group and writing for the newspaper. \"There was the excitement of a new Caribbean being created,\" he says. \"There were new writers and artists emerging. Obviously colonialism was there and racism and history and so on. We had our anger, but it was kind of great to be angry - it had its own vigour. It wasn't at all sour or vengeful.\" </p> <p>After university he taught in schools in St Lucia, Grenada and Jamaica, as well as contributing articles and reviews to papers in Trinidad and Jamaica. In 1953 he went to live in Trinidad, where he continued to write poetry and plays. He and his brother had always written small plays which they performed themselves in the house. His first publicly performed plays were put on in St. Lucia in 1950. Later that year he won a Rockefeller scholarship to study theatre in New York. Walcott ended that trip early after suffering from homesickness but has subsequently worked a great deal in American theatre. In 1998 he was the co-lyricist in Capeman, Paul Simon's $11m Broadway debacle. It was based on the life of Puerto Rican Salvador Agr\u00f3n, who as a 16-year-old in the 1950s had murdered two white teenagers while wearing a red satin cape. The case had become a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre for radicals in the 60s and the musical attracted massive publicity. When it closed after just two months it was the most expensive failure in Broadway history. Even before its spectacular collapse Walcott had begun to dissociate himself from the show, complaining that his work was being butchered by the succession of directors brought in to salvage it. Ultimately he regarded the project as a waste of four years' work. </p> <p>When Walcott returned to Trinidad in 1959 he formed the Trinidad Theatre Workshop. It celebrated its 40th anniversary last year. \"We've had some terrific actors,\" he says. \"People sometimes dismiss it because it is not a professional theatre, but that's just because the economic context means it can't sustain professional theatre, it doesn't mean the performances are not first class.\" </p> <p>When Walcott's play, Ti-Jean, was performed in Central Park in New York in the early 1970s, two of the actors, Hamilton Parris and Albert Laveau, attracted rave reviews - better than those for the play itself. The theatre's reputation for excellence has since attracted overseas directors like the RSC's Terry Hands and Greg Doran, and the company has won awards when touring in America. But Walcott has still had to fight a long, bitter and largely unsuccessful battle with the Trinidad authorities to obtain state funding for what is a national theatre in all but name. </p> <p>\"The quality of literature that has come out of the Caribbean over the last 40 years has been phenomenal,\" he says. \"Who could have foreseen that a place like Trinidad, which is of the scale of some English counties, could have produced both Naipaul and CLR James? And there is equivalent potential there in the theatre. You would think that a society would say that art is as necessary as roads and sewage. But the attitude is that art is an amateur activity, which is not just short-sighted thinking, it is illiterate and ignorant thinking.\" </p> <p>Caryl Phillips sees why he is so angry. \"It's not as if vast amounts of money are needed, but even this wasn't forthcoming. It has grated on him as an individual. He made very early on a serious commitment to the Caribbean in terms not just of his aesthetic but also the physical and emotional trajectory of his life.\" </p> <p>This emotional trajectory has not been straightforward, and his professional and domestic life have often been stormy. Until he won the Nobel Prize he had been consistently short of money. His health was put under pressure by heavy drinking and smoking. He is now diabetic and no longer does either. His first marriage was in 1954 to Fay Moston, a secretary from a wealthy Jamaican family. They had one son, now a painter living in St Lucia, the following year, but the marriage broke up in 1956. His second wife, Margaret Maillard, was an almoner in a hos pital in Port of Spain, Trinidad. She was also active in the Trinidad arts scene as a dancer and a painter, and the couple shocked local opinion by living together before getting married. They have two daughters; one is now at university and the other works for an advertising company. Walcott has three grandchildren. </p> <p>His marriage to Margaret, shaky since the late 60s, broke up after he had an affair in the mid-70s with a young dancer in one of his plays, Norline Metivier. He married her in 1976, but that also ended in divorce. His partner since 1987 has been Sigrid Nama, a Danish-Flemish-American art dealer, whom he met when giving a reading in Pittsburgh that year. </p> <p>Walcott has included a fair amount of autobiographical content in his poems over the years but all this material was yet to come when he self-published his first collection, 25 Poems, in 1948. It was funded by a $200 gift from his mother and was printed to look as much like a Faber &amp; Faber book as possible. This arrangement wasn't unusual in the Caribbean; VS Naipaul's father had paid for the publication of his first book of short stories. </p> <p>Walcott's first collection of poems published outside the Caribbean was In a Green Night in 1962. Tom Maschler had recently joined Jonathan Cape and was on the lookout for young poets. Alan Ross, editor of The London Magazine, had published some of Walcott's work and put his name forward. \"With fiction I am a totally confident judge,\" says Maschler. \"I don't know in the same way with poetry, but I did like the book enormously. But I must admit I didn't have any idea he would become such a significant figure. If we had published Seamus Heaney I think I would have been waiting for him to win the Nobel Prize. But while I did know that Derek was a very important poet, I didn't know then just how important he would be.\" </p> <p>Walcott, although a new name in England, was already at this stage a significant mature artist in the Caribbean, and as early as 1964 he was able to publish his Selected Poems. He went on to build his reputation with a series of acclaimed collections that extended his work from the early celebrations of Caribbean landscape. Both The Castaway (1965) and The Gulf (1969) deal with his personal anxieties in being pulled both by the European tradition and his native culture. Another Life, his 1973 book-length autobiographical poem, saw his breakthrough in terms of critical respect, and his reputation was further secured with The Star-Apple Kingdom in 1979, in which he probed the many strata of Caribbean society in terms of language, race and culture. </p> <p>By this time Walcott, although maintaining strong links with Trinidad and St Lucia, was essentially living in America. After the false start of his first visit in the late 50s, he was by now increasingly an insider in the east coast literary establishment. He was invited to contribute to the influential liberal journal Partisan Review and also for the New York Review of Books. The poet Robert Lowell champi oned his work, and they became friends. </p> <p>Walcott was by now doing more readings in America and had begun to teach at prestigious American universities. First at Rutgers, then Yale, Columbia, Harvard, and since 1982 at Boston University, where he is a professor of English and teaches a postgraduate theatre course. Walcott's own poetry has long been seen as ideally suited to black and post-colonial literature courses, but he has always distanced himself from what he sees as a ghetto mentality. He has always written in English, although he often uses the rhythms of the French Creole he spoke alongside English as a boy. \"I hate all that nonsense about not touching the colonialists' lan guage. All that about it being corrupting and belonging to the master and making you Caliban. That thinking just denies you an outlet. You deny everything that is great from a language, whether it is Conrad or Shakespeare.\" </p> <p>It saddens him that some African-American literature is seen as being different from American literature. \"I think that is baffling and wrong. If you think of American literature up to about 1920, Jews were not thought to be part of it. Now look at American literature: Roth, Mailer, Bellow. That is what American literature is. Some people say that these Jewish writers were white so it is a different issue, but it wasn't like that at the time. Jewish writers were really excluded from the concept of American literature.\" </p> <p>Dabydeen sees this approach as part of his commitment to the highest standards. \"He really believes that writing is about craft. You must have syllabic intelligence, you must know rhythm and where a line ends. In other words you can't slap words down on a page and call it dub. That is black performance fuckery. It's just not good enough to throw in a bit of Creole and think you can get away with it.\" </p> <p>Walcott has been widely seen as dismissive of the political correctness on some American campuses. His friends say he can be flirtatious, enjoys double entendres and sexual jokes, and likes to test people out with outrageous statements. This style got him into trouble. In 1982 a student at Harvard complained that he propositioned her and that after she rebuffed him he reduced her grade. When the Harvard authorities changed the student's grade, both Joseph Brodsky and Susan Sontag wrote complaining that this was a slur on Walcott's integrity. In 1996 a former student at Boston University claimed that he refused to produce her play after she turned him down. The university stood by him and the case was settled out of court. Both incidents put huge pressure on Walcott, and for a time his career and future employment prospects were in jeopardy. It was believed that the incidents also counted against him last year when the new British poet laureate was named. Walcott had made no secret of the fact that he would have liked the job. </p> <p>\"I thought it would have expanded the idea of the laureateship in a nice way,\" he says. \"I'm still amazed and thrilled that the captain of the English cricket team is of Indian descent and when I see black footballers playing for England. Twenty or 30 years ago that would not have been possible, so I was flattered that I was being considered.\" </p> <p>The man who got the job, Andrew Motion, is a great admirer of Walcott's work: \"In a literary culture often connected with academies it would be easy to see his work as ideally suited to certain courses. But he has the freedom of imagination to engage with other things too. Those easily spotted themes in fact take their place with an almost limitless number of other themes and interests and that is a sign of a real quality.\" </p> <p>Walcott's 1988 collection, The Arkansas Testament, had received mixed reviews, but in 1990 his refashioning of Homer's Iliad and Odyssey in a 20th-century Caribbean fishing setting, Omeros, was widely acclaimed. Hermione Lee was one of the judges who awarded the WHSmith book award to Walcott that year. \"I think Omeros is one of the great epic poems of the 20th century,\" she says. \"There is a wonderful hubris about the work which is true of the man. Even in a five-minute meeting you can see he is a person of enormous boldness and grandeur. He does a big number both as a writer and a person.\" </p> <p>Lee has taught Omeros to her students at Oxford. She says that some of the more feminist students do find him quite macho and difficult. \"He very much writes about the male ego and produces a sort of autobiography of the male epic poet. It is a very physical, active and heroic idea of poetry. It is not Emily Dickinson.\" </p> <p>The poem, however, has not met with universal approval. The poet and critic Craig Raine, in his literary magazine Aret\u00e9, recently subjected it to forensic levels of close reading and found a series of anomalies and repetitions. A canoe lost on page 50 is sold on page 116. Eyes are described as slitted on seven occasions. Raine also sees Walcott as being too \"touched\" by other poets: Dylan Thomas, Hopkins, Auden, Yeats, Lowell, Heaney and Brodsky. \"The clich\u00e9d colonial paradigm of invasion and conquest has been fulfilled aesthetically,\" says Raine, before conceding that this is \"odd, given that Walcott's pronouncements on the colonial past and its role in the present are so eminently sensible.\" </p> <p>For all that, the publication of Omeros is widely seen as the clinching factor in Walcott being awarded the Nobel Prize for literature in 1992. He says that even now he is still coming to terms with the \"width of the prize\". Apart from fish cakes and squares being named after him, his face also appears on stamps and phonecards in St Lucia. Friends say that his experiences in America and demands made on him after winning the prize have made him more cautious about people and more determined to continue to write and not let his achievements become set in stone. </p> <p>\"He is driven by a need to establish himself in terms of history,\" says King. \"Some writers in old age will turn to meditation or ping pong or something, but Derek just isn't like that. He is a writer and an intellectual. Derek read and wrote serious books and serious literature and that was his life. That's not to say he doesn't watch comedy shows or basketball on television. But he has never enjoyed going to cocktail parties or having dinner with strangers.\" </p> <p>Dabydeen applauds the fact that Walcott has produced some of his strongest work since receiving the prize. \"When you get the Nobel Prize, usually for the rest of your career people are waiting for the work to be rubbish, but he has gone from strength to strength. He really does believe that writing is a sacred calling and he doesn't judge himself by contemporary standards. He really worries whether what he has written can measure up to Shakespeare.\" </p> <p>Walcott's time is currently spent travelling the world giving readings and commuting between his homes in St Lucia and New York. He is painting, writing a screenplay about a steel band and \"fiddling around\" with several plays, as well as constructing verse. He is obviously committed to his calling, but has had his doubts. Towards the end of Omeros, Walcott breaks off from the hurtling narrative to question his role as a poet: </p> <p> What I had read and rewritten till literature was guilty as History. When would the sails drop from from my eyes, when would I not hear the Trojan War in two fishermen cursing in Ma Kilman's shop? When would my head shake off its echoes like a horse shaking off a wreath of flies? When would it stop, the echo in the throat, insisting, 'Omeros'; when would I enter that light beyond metaphor? </p> <p>His answer is the scale of achievement in the poem itself. But he has also put it rather more succinctly when he saluted another writer torn between cultures, his friend and fellow Nobel laureate Joseph Brodsky. \"Poetry is still treason,\" wrote Walcott, \"because it is truth.\" </p> <p><strong> Life at a glance: Derek Alton Walcott </strong></p> <p><strong>Born:</strong> January 23 1930, Castries, St Lucia. </p> <p><strong> Education:</strong> St Mary's College, St Lucia; University of West Indies, Jamaica. </p> <p><strong> Married:</strong> 1954 Fay Moston, (one son), divorced. 1962 Margaret Maillard, (two daughters), divorced. 1977 Norline Metivier, divorced. </p> <p><strong> Career:</strong> Teacher at schools in St Lucia and Grenada; lecturer at Kingston College, Jamaica; Rutgers University; Yale University; Columbia University; Harvard University; Boston University. </p> <p><strong> Essays:</strong> 1998 What the Twilight Says. </p> <p><strong> Poetry:</strong> 1948 25 Poems; 1962 In a Green Night; 1964 Selected Poems; 1965 The Castaway; 1969 The Gulf; 1973 Another Life; 1976 Sea Grapes; 1979 The Star-Apple Kingdom; 1981 The Fortunate Traveller; 1984 Midsummer; 1986 Collected Poems; 1987 The Arkansas Testament; 1990 Omeros; 1997 The Bounty; 2000 Tiepolo's Hound. </p> <p><strong> Plays:</strong> 1952 Harry Dernier; 1957 Ti-Jean; 1970 Dream on Monkey Mountain; 1978 The Joker of Seville; 1980 Remembrance; 1993 Odyssey. </p> <p><strong> Awards:</strong> 1989 Queen's Gold Medal for poetry; 1992 Nobel Prize for literature. </p> <p>\u0095 Tiepolo's Hound is published by Faber and Faber at \u00a320.

  "<p>Householders could one day be producing as much electricity as all the country's nuclear power stations combined, thanks to the revolutionary application of a device developed in the early 19th century. </p> <p>A new version of the device, the Stirling engine, is set to turn ordinary domestic gas boilers into miniature power stations, generating electricity whenever you switch on the central heating or hot water. </p> <p>It won't make electricity meters run backwards. But for an estimated \u00a3500 extra on the price of a new boiler, the machine will generate electricity for the home for nothing, using excess heat that would otherwise escape out the flue. </p> <p>In Britain, a confidential report prepared for electricity companies by energy consultants EA Technology estimates that by 2025, 13m of the country's 23m households could have their own little power station humming away in the boiler cupboard. </p> <p>The Stirling engine was patented in 1816 by a Scottish clergyman, Robert Stirling. It consists of two cylinders, filled with gas, each containing a piston. The cylinders are heated and cooled in turn, making the pistons move up and down to turn a drive shaft. </p> <p>In existing domestic gas boilers, about a third of the heat is wasted. With the latest make of Stirling engine fitted, that spare heat is used to drive a small generator. </p> <p>The idea of turning homes into power stations is known as \"micro chp\" (combined heat and power). </p> <p>EA Technology is championing a Stirling engine made by WhisperTech, a New Zealand company, which can generate a kilowatt of electricity - enough to power three fridges. </p> <p>British Gas is working on a different design with a similar power output, based on an engine from the US firm SunPower. </p> <p>\"We have now got to the stage where we've overcome the technical barriers, and it's simply a matter of product development, things like designing the right colour for the casing,\" said EA Technology's Jeremy Harrison. </p> <p>He said the first units would be on sale in 2002. Depending on the size of the home, he said, they would save householders between \u00a3150 and \u00a3300 a year on their electricity bills. </p> <p>The beauty of micro chp is that it cuts in when demand on the grid from households is greatest. On a summer's afternoon, with the fridge on and the TV and VCR on standby, a household might be using only a few hundred watts of electricity. </p> <p>On a winter's evening, with kettles, electric cookers, irons, washing machines and tumble dryers working, that might rise to 20 kilowatts. But with the central heating and hot water on, the home would be generating its own electricity, lightening the load on the grid, the family budget, and the environment. </p> <p>EA Technology estimates that at peak times, a network of 13m households would generate 15,000 to 23,000 megawatts of electricity, compared with 15,000 megawatts produced by the country's nuclear power stations. </p> <p>However, if the government wanted to promote micro chp specifically as a way of cutting down on the carbon dioxide emissions held responsible for global warming, it would need to close high-emitting coal-fired power stations, rather than nuclear ones. </p> <p>The government has been keen to promote chp as a means of implementing the 1997 Kyoto protocols, which called for reductions in carbon emissions.</p>",
  "A bodybuilder who died from a cocaine overdose in police custody could have had a better chance of survival if police had taken him to hospital before he collapsed, an inquest heard yesterday. <p>West London coroner's court was also told by a doctor that CS spray may have made Oliver Scott, 26, from Surbiton, south-west London, more aggressive. </p> <p>The former British bodybuilding champion was arrested in Shepherd's Bush, west London, on suspicion of affray and possessing an offensive weapon in December last year. Police had to use batons, riot shields and three cans of CS spray to subdue him, the court heard. </p> <p>An ambulance was called to Hammersmith police station, where Scott was being detained, and he was taken to Charing Cross hospital where he died from cocaine toxicity. </p> <p>A pathologist, Nat Cary, told the court: \"If he were in an intensive care environment when his final collapse occurred, then simple support measures might have been helpful. </p> <p>\"It is always easier in retrospect but the best thing is to take these sort of people to hospital which has the security to deal with them and also the treatment.\" </p> <p>He added it was possible Scott would have died anyway. \"The problem is these people are often quite a handful to take to hospital. Nor is it easy for hospitals to deal with people in this state.\" </p> <p>Dr Cary said Scott could have been sent \"severely mad\" by the large dose of cocaine he had taken, and CS gas could have made him more aggressive in combination with the drug. </p> <p>The court heard officers had intended to take Scott to hospital but in the police van he became violent. </p> <p>The inquest continues. </p>",

  "In Mexico's most important area of tropical rainforest the jaguar prowls, a type of red macaw found nowhere else in the world makes its nest, and the only swamp crocodile known to live above 800 metres has its home. <p>But, the authorities say, the ecological balance of this global treasure of biodiversity called the Montes Azules biosphere reserve is under serious threat from communities deep in the interior, most of whom say they will not leave without a fight. </p> <p>\"They can come and get us if they like, but we live tranquilly here, everything grows so easily and we don't want to go,\" Don Mariano, whose link to civilisation is a river four-hours' walk away from his village, San Francisco. \"We think they want to kick out the poor so they can sell it to the rich.\" </p> <p>San Francisco is one of the 14 \"irregular communities\" who have vowed never to leave the rainforest, their determination strengthened by their link to the Zapatista rebels hiding in the jungle. </p> <p>Another 12, non-Zapatista, communities are similarly reluctant to leave such fertile soil, and similarly suspicious of the authorities' relocation programme. </p> <p>\"If the government was really so worried about the environment they would have solved the problem long ago,\" said Porfirio Encino, who represents seven communities which have agreed in principle to negotiate but in practice have made it clear that they are unwilling to go. </p> <p>\"No, this is not an ecological problem, it is a political and military issue,\" he said. There are rumours that relocation is a pretext to facilitate an attack on the Zapatistas. </p> <p>\"And there is oil in the area, and a wealth of biological resources bio-prospectors would love to exploit.\" </p> <p>\"History has taught them to mistrust the government,\" said Roman Perez, an official at the reserve. But if they did not leave, he said, ecological disaster could be as little as five or 10 years away. </p> <p>The reserve covers 331,000 hectares (827,000 acres) in Chiapas, near the Guatemalan border. It was created in 1978 in the heart of the Lacandon jungle, which was then shrinking at an alarming rate as prospectors thinned out the valuable trees and the advancing frontier of farming levelled its edges. </p> <p>The need to actively protect its integrity was largely ignored until a series of forest fires two years ago damaged about 30,000 hectares and focused attention on the increasing number of communities set up within it. </p> <p>The authorities accept that there there is little they can do about the two dozen well-established villages on the perimeter which have legal titles to the land, so they are concentrating on the more recent settlers. </p> <p>\"The biggest risk is fragmentation,\" Mr Perez said. </p> <p>Although the irregular communities are small and dispersed, they threaten to break up the unity of the ecosystem. </p> <p>The danger is greatest in the dry season, when the settlers burn off the vegetation in preparation for planting, posing the threat of uncontrollable fires. </p> <p>\"The most logical thing to do would be to send in the security forces to evict the irregular communities, but that simply is too politically delicate a thing to do, because of the Zapatistas.\" he said. \"Realistically, a long-term solution to the problem will not be possible until that conflict is resolved.\" </p> <p>\"We didn't want to move from that blessed land, where things grow on their own,\" Enrique Perez said, standing in front of his new concrete house and surveying the five hectares he has been given in a heavily farmed area 50 miles west of Montes Azules. \"Sure, there is the road, but what good is the road when we have nothing to sell? I am thinking of going back.\" </p> <p>Those who have yet to move are also reconsidering their decision to go, in the light of the recent presidential and state governorship elections victories by candidates committed to peace talks with the Zapatistas. </p> <p>The word spreading through the jungle is that the new authorities will be anxious to defuse the tension that the relocation drive has created around the rebels' safe havens.</p>",
  "<p>The threat of a trade war between the European Union and the United States moved a step closer yesterday after the EU said proposed US amendments to a multi-billion dollar tax break scheme for exporters still contravened global trading rules. </p> <p>Yesterday's rejection of amendments to the US's Foreign Sales Corporation scheme raises the prospect that Brussels could seek World Trade Organisation permission to impose sanctions on American exports. The bill could run to billions of dollars, dwarfing the $300m of sanctions which Washington is imposing on EU goods in separate disputes over beef and bananas. </p> <p>The WTO ruled earlier this year that the FSC scheme was an illegal export subsidy, and gave Washington until October 1 to change it. US trade officials proposed a reform plan in July. </p> <p>EU trade commissioner Pascal Lamy told deputy US treasury secretary Stuart Eizenstat in a letter on Thursday the proposed changes to the FSC scheme \"fail to render it compatible with international trade rules\". </p> <p>But a senior US official insisted the proposal complied with WTO rules and said the Clinton administration would ask Congress to approve the plan by October 1 in spite of EU opposition. </p> <p>\"We're left with no choice,\" the US official told reporters. \"It is critical that the US move forward [with its FSC replacement proposal] by October 1.\" </p> <p>The existing scheme covers hundreds of billions of dollars of exports and provides US companies, including multinationals such as Boeing and Microsoft, with up to $4bn a year in tax breaks. </p> <p>If the United States presses ahead with the proposals, EU sources said Brussels could return to the WTO after October 1 to seek a ruling against the reformed scheme. If the WTO agreed with Brussels, the EU could then seek permission to impose trade sanctions on US goods totalling billions of dollars. </p> <p>That could spark a damaging confrontation between the world's leading trade powers in the lead-up to the US presidential elections in November. </p> <p>This case was the first major victory for the EU at the WTO, after a succession of rulings in the US's favour.</p>",
  "<p>Following a week of backstabbing and brinkmanship fit to grace a Bolshoi production of Boris Godunov, Russia's revered ballet and opera company is to gather amid the fast-fading splendour of its theatre opposite the Kremlin this morning to consider its future. </p> <p>The Bolshoi is in crisis - physically, financially, and aesthetically. The famous theatre, 147 years old, is in such poor shape that the slightest jolt could literally bring the house down. </p> <p>From his offices across the road, President Vladimir Putin can watch the rain leaking through the Bolshoi's roof, observe the theatre's slow subsidence into the marshy foundations on which it stands, and see that the reconstruction work started years ago has ground to a halt through lack of funds. </p> <p>After an August of serial disaster, Putin can ill afford a further blow to Russian prestige So, on Monday he pulled a fast one. </p> <p>On a day off for the 2,632 Bolshoi employees, Putin purged the Bolshoi bosses, Vladimir Vasilyev, executive director, choreographer, and ex-star dancer and Vladimir Kokonin, the administrative chief. Their posts were abolished, too. </p> <p>Many of the Bolshoi stars were performing abroad and caught unawares. Vasilyev learned he had been fired from the radio. After sending out invitations to the Muscovite elite for a gala opening for the theatre's 225th season - to have been held yesterday - Vasilyev had to cancel the event. </p> <p>On Tuesday he boycotted a meeting with the culture minister, Mikhail Shvydkoi, who is the main winner of the unseemly tussle. Shvydkoi will tell a closed meeting of the company this morning that from now on, his ministry will be in overall charge. He will then nominate a little-known crony, Anatoly Iksanov, as the Bolshoi's general director and Gennady Rozhdestvensky, the conductor, previously of the BBC Philharmonic, as the Bolshoi's artistic director. </p> <p>\"There's been conflict at the top of the Bolshoi for years, hindering anything from getting done,\" says Maya Kabakhidze, the ministry official for the arts. \"The minister is not going to interfere in the repertoire. But the top priority for the next five years is the construction problem. That means the general director will be the boss and the artistic director will be his subordinate.\" </p> <p>The 1990s were not kind to the Bolshoi, its decline made that much harder to bear by the rise to global acclaim of its great rival, St Petersburg's Mariinsky/Kirov opera and ballet under the mercurial Valery Gergiev. </p> <p>\"The Bolshoi can no longer compete with the Royal Opera House or the New York Metropolitan or Vienna,\" says Larisa Dolgacheva, opera critic for the Kultura arts journal. \"It's such a sad situation - mediocre directors, boring scenography.\" Vasilyev, a revered former dancer who turned 60 this year, has had more misses than hits in his five years in charge, according to the Moscow critics. \"He affects the air of a Chekhovian intellectual, a dreamer who can't cope with the world. He's taken the Bolshoi to a dead end,\" says Ms Dolgacheva. </p> <p>The appointment of Rozhdestvensky would restore the Bolshoi tradition of having a musician and conductor as the artistic chief of the 263-strong corps de ballet, 107-strong opera company, 281 orchestra players, and chorus of 196. But the conductor, who made his Bolshoi debut almost 40 years ago, appears to be playing hard to get. Shvydkoi confirmed yesterday he had offered him the post. Rozhdestvensky made it plain he would drive a hard bargain and would not make up his mind until today's crucial meeting. </p> <p>If Gergiev in St Petersburg is a dynamic 47 and a top name in international conducting, Rozhdestvensky is 69 and some wonder if he is the man to turn the Bolshoi's fortunes around. </p> <p>\"He's a huge talent, an outstanding musician with an extraordinary musical memory,\" says a Moscow violinist who has known him for 20 years and worked with him frequently. \"But he doesn't like staying in one place for long. He gets bored and he can't stand long rehearsals with orchestras. What the Bolshoi really needs is a musical and artistic leader for at least five years to raise the level of the orchestra and of performance.\" </p> <p>Art apart, the Kremlin is making it plain that the reconstruction project is the priority. According to the Putin decrees, the company will move into a secondary theatre to be built by January 2002 so that the main theatre can be restored and rebuilt by 2005. The Soviet government ordered the reconstruction in 1987 but work ground to a halt although \u00a380m had already been spent. The reconstruction is expected to cost \u00a3270m, though there is scant detail on where the money is coming from. </p> <p>The job of overseeing the project falls to Iksanov, a respected if little-known arts administrator who managed a theatre in St Petersburg and currently runs the state arts TV channel, Kultura, a post previously held by Shvydkoi. </p> <p>Under the new broom in the Kremlin, Shvydkoi is building himself an arts empire. Earlier this year he performed the same trick with the Russian film industry, subordinating the state cinema board to his ministry. Some say the sumptuous museums and collections of the Kremlin are next in line. </p> <p>The new Bolshoi season opens in two weeks in time-honoured fashion with a Glinka opera followed by Swan Lake the next evening. \"It's such a remarkable theatre,\" says Ms Kabakhidze. \"But it's in big danger and we don't want to lose it.\"</p>",
  "<p>Scratch the shiny surface of the internet and you will find a vast electronic mail-order catalogue. It was inevitable that the purveyors of interior decor would converge on the the new medium, and the internet is now teeming with sites that cater to home shoppers, to decorators and to those of us who simply wish to drool over objects of domestic desire without having to traipse down to the high street. Some of the new sites may well be the Heals and Habitats of the future; others may not be with us in a year's time. But it is now possible to furnish your home just by logging on. </p> <p>One of the smoothest sites comes from a company called Interior Internet, a branded electronic megamart of interior design that is what one might call lifestyle- rather than design-led, with a range of thematic search options - among them are \"Nutopia\" (futuristic retro), Loft Living, Fantasy, \"Chic-and-Bleak\" - along with a more functional category search, so that browsers can click on lighting, tables, ashtrays even. </p> <p>But hang on - isn't this the one retail sector where it is essential to touch and even bounce on your bed or chair to be? \"Actually, that hasn't been much of an issue,\" explains Interior Internet's Alistair Taylor. \"The traffic we get isn't really looking for comfortable, bouncy sofas. But we send samples if we can [sofas not included], and if there's a problem when the object arrives, we have a returns policy.\" And the trade - much of their business comes from interior designers and architects - has already proved itself to be happy to work \"with imagery rather than the physical objects\". </p> <p>Taylor set up Interior Internet with fellow fashion graduate Johnston Campbell, and they are typical of the e-generation - twentysomethings who had an idea, got financial backing and went on-line four years ago. They have been online for six months. Theirs is a shell operation: that is, it holds no stock and ships items direct from suppliers and manufacturers, so there is no need for a storeroom or fancy shop, just a bit of soft-modern multimedia design on the site. And there is no shoplifting. </p> <p>As with the other interiors sites, the goods are represented by thumbnail photographs that can be enlarged at a lick of the mouse. Some items can even be viewed from different angles. You can also read about what's available: the site currently features an article about Italian designer Piero Fornasetti, whose designs itsells. ut the central point is to shift the 30,000 items on sale, which include work by Nicolas Haslam, Andrew Martin, Mark Brazier-Jones and Habitat's Tom Dixon. Some pieces are one-offs, others commissions. </p> <p>It is a fairly eclectic site, which reflects Taylor and Campbell's tastes. \"People seem to think that the internet suggests that we will sell only contemporary things,\" says Taylor. \"But in the loft-living section, there might be an 18th-century bureau. That's what is interesting about decorating - being able to make it gel.\" </p> <p>Indeed, Taylor's own north London flat resists the pared-down technological aesthetic, preferring a riot of rococo, rendered in bright colours. He has an ochre living room, a deep-red bedroom, a turquoise spare room and a blue hallway. Walls are dressed with colourful finds, such as a mounted display of Brazilian butterflies, and the look could fit into his site's \"fantasy\" category. </p> <p>Some new sites are connoisseur-led, selling provenanced pieces as if artworks, but Taylor is not too bothered with that, professionally or personally: in the middle of his living room is a huge repro chandelier, and the bust overlooking his bed is plaster, not marble. </p> <p>Amid all this opulence are touches of surrealism. A series of 14 Salvador Dal\u00ed prints is arranged in two rows along a wall - \"architectural images of the female form\", as Taylor puts it. He also has pieces by Fornasetti, the results of auction-picking, and plenty of south-east Asian furnishings, gleaned from various travels. </p> <p>Eatmyhandbagbitch.com, on the other hand, is a website title of extravagant camp aggression (particularly when growled by way of phone greeting), and its portal is designed in a pink retro-pop style. Georgina Stead, who runs the site and its parent shop with her partner, George Enoch, explains that the name comes from a work of art that Enoch made several years ago \"Most modern furniture shops and sites tend to have graphicky pencil images and names that include the words \"20th\" \"century\" and \"design\", explains Stead. \"We wanted to be a bit different.\" </p> <p>Stead used to work at a bank and Enoch was, and remains, an artist: such collusions between finance and creativity are common in dot.com circles. They did their apprenticeships on market stalls in Camden and Spitalfields, before moving to Brick Lane, which is now such a dot.com centre that some have dubbed it \"Click\" Lane. They set up the site six months ago, purely as an adjunct to the shop, but it ow turns around 90% of their business. \"It's a full-time job to monitor it,\" says Stead. </p> <p>On the site are thumbnails of modern antiques by designers from the fifties - Italian Joe Colombo, mid-century Finnish wizard Eero Saarinen and contemporary British designer Ross Lovegrove. It is a mixture, says Stead, of \"futuristic and modern\" and is divided into regional and stylistic tendencies - a rather more academic and design-savvy approach than the glitzy graphics suggest. \"It's not the sort of kitsch that you'd find on some market stalls,\" she says. \"We are concerned with good design.\" </p> <p>There are those who use the internet simply as they would a leaflet: modern furniture dealer Graham Manchais among them. He runs his site as a cottage industry, photographing, scanning, selling and delivering on his own. Mancha does not have much time for the futuristic hyperbole that surrounds the internet, but was an \"early adopter\" of the medium, and has maintained an internet presence for the past six years. </p> <p>\"Back then, hardly anyone in Britain was on the internet,\" he says. \"I only did it because my service provider gave free web space. It was a happy accident.\" </p> <p>Mancha testifies to the internet's global reach: when he started the site, he was surprised to receive calls within days of the launch from people in the US who wanted to buy his postwar modern furniture. In fact, Graham Mancha is the classic example of just how the internet can empower small traders. He doesn't monitor the site - which costs him just \u00a310 a month to maintain - and he works from home (in Bedfordshire), which is the perfect way to keep down all those overheads.</p> <p><strong> Log on, bliss out </strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.banaldesign.com\">www.banaldesign.com</a><br> Connoisseur US site selling antiques from the 80s and 90s. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bluedeco.com\">www.bluedeco.com</a><br> Intelligent site selling contemporary work by young designers. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.chiasmus.co.uk\">www.chiasmus.co.uk</a><br> A fun attitude pervades this 'fresh and funky' site.

  "<p>In common with thousands of other Scottish Widows policyholders, the arrival this week of my larger-than-expected windfall had me choking on my corn flakes. </p> <p>Given that I have only a small \"Serps opt-out\" personal pension plan with Scottish Widows, I'd assumed that I'd get, at best, a few hundred pounds. Despite being a personal finance journalist who should, arguably, know better, I'd therefore taken little notice of reports on how best to invest it. </p> <p>So, when to my delight a cheque arrived for nearly \u00a35,000, I asked several independent financial advisers (IFAs) how people like me, who have never been in the wealth bracket to seriously invest in equities, could make use of such unexpected windfalls to start building diversified stockmarket-based portfolios. </p> <p>The aim for most novice investors would be to salt the money away over the medium term - for at least five to 10 years - to achieve capital growth. And opting for pooled funds like unit trust or investment trusts, where your money is put together with that of others and invested across a wide range of stocks, is a safer strategy than investing direct in individual shares. But which funds should one start with and should you be splitting a sum like \u00a35,000 between different funds? </p> <p>Mark Bolland, technical director of IFA Chamberlain de Broe says: \"Over the medium to long term, it makes sense to stash your money away in a tax-efficient environment. So, if you haven't already got one, invest via a tax-free Isa [individual savings account] and find a provider that offers a good range of funds like Gartmore or Henderson. </p> <p>\"Start by building up your UK and European exposure so you could, for example, split your \u00a35,000 and put 75% in Gartmore's UK Growth Fund and 25% in its European Selected Opportunities fund.\" </p> <p>An option for investors who haven't the time or inclination to think about the global asset allocation of their portfolio is to invest the whole lump sum in a large, international investment trust and leave diversification up to the fund manager. \"I'd go for Alliance Trust, Foreign &amp; Colonial or Henderson Investors' Witan trust which are all very good, broadly spread funds,\" he says. </p> <p>Witan is also the top recommendation of Patrick Connolly at IFA Chartwell Investment Management for novice investors. \"This low-risk trust will give you a ready-made diversified portfolio in one fund,\" he says. \"It combines the individual expertise of different Henderson fund managers who all contribute to this one umbrella fund which also has very low charges.\" </p> <p>Like Mr Bolland, Gavin Haynes, investment director of IFA Whitechurch Securities, favours the UK as the first building block of a diversified portfolio. \"The advantages are that there are no currency risks in UK and you are likely to be familiar with the underlying companies that UK funds are investing in,\" says Mr Haynes. </p> <p>He recommends a Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale unit trust Isa with \u00a35,000 split three ways with \u00a32,000 in its UK Growth, \u00a32,000 in its European Growth and \u00a31,000 in its Technology trust to add, \"a bit of aggression\". </p> <p>An alternative would be an Aberdeen Unit Trust Managers Isa with its UK Blue Chip fund as the core holding plus some money in its Technology trust. </p> <p>International investments should be the next step to building a diversified portfolio says Mr Haynes who favours the EquiSar unit trusts from Sarasin Investment Management which offers, \"a good international spread of blue chip companies chosen on a thematic \"best of sector\" basis\". </p> <p>Dan Kemp of IFA Holden Meehan takes a different approach in recommending that new investors start with international funds, adding other sector and country funds, including the UK, as their portfolio grows. </p> <p>\"First, make use of your Isa allowance, topping up any Isa you've already started to the maximum of \u00a37,000. Remember you can use a new fund , though it must come from the same Isa provider. Then, as a core holding, I'd go for Fidelity's International unit trust or Mercury's Global Titans before building up European exposure using Gartmore European Selected Opportunities.\" </p> <p>For investors who want only ethical investments, a sector in which Holden Meehan specialises, Mr Kemp recommends two unit trusts, Murray Johnstone's Ethical World and Jupiter's Ecology. </p> <p><strong>Will this windfall raise your tax bill?</strong></p> <p>For thousands of Scottish Widows policyholders, joy over the size of their windfalls has been marred by the potential problem of an unexpected capital gains tax liability. </p> <p>Patrick Connolly, at IFA Chartwell Investment Management, says the firm has been contacted by clients expecting windfalls under \u00a37,200 - the current annual CGT per person allowance - who have actually received lump sums of \u00a310,000-\u00a312,000. </p> <p>A higher rate 40% taxpayer receiving \u00a312,200, for example, who has no further capital gains in the tax year faces a CGT liability of almost \u00a32,000. Even basic rate taxpayers could end up paying 40p in the pound if their windfall tips their total earnings into top rate tax territory - although sums paid directly into pension schemes do not attract the tax. </p> <p>These gains must be declared on tax returns for the year 2000-01, so funds must be available to pay the tax bill in January 2002. </p> <p>But there are ways of possibly lessening the CGT blow. Investors should first review their existing portfolios to see if they have any capital losses they can offset. \"But, if you choose this option, it may be sensible to take independent advice as it may not prove wise to sell a particular investment simply because it is standing at a loss,\" Mr Connolly says. </p> <p>The alternative is to invest in vehicles like Venture Capital Trusts (VCTs) and Enterprise Investment Schemes (EISs) which allow CGT liabilities to be deferred and often, with careful planning, avoided entirely. </p> <p>The downside of VCTs and EISs is that they are generally viewed as high risk investments. </p> <p>Dan Kemp, of IFA Holden Meehan, suggests those facing a CGT bill might also take advice on whether they could get the full benefit of their windfall by investing part of it in a pension. </p> <p>A free information pack for Scottish Widows policyholders with a CGT liability is available from Chartwell on 01225 321710.</p>",

  "<p>Film and fashion have been flirting since before Charlie Chaplin first put a hat on, but this week the love affair reached a new high - one with a distinctly dodgy twist. First, Martin Scorsese revealed that, having tackled boxing, gambling and organised crime, his next project would deal with the most crooked business of them all - fashion - in a film about the Gucci family feud. And Guy Ritchie's latest film, Snatch, which hits cinema screens today, is sure to extend the mockney-mobster aesthetic pioneered by its predecessor, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. This fashionable new look is seeping, with ever greater concentration, into the style sensibility of the average twentysomething British male. Not since James Dean slouched in Rebel Without a Cause has on-screen style made such an impact on our wardrobes. </p> <p>Gangster chic is arguably cinema's greatest contribution to men's fashion, and after decades of New York tough guys, Ritchie - himself seldom seen without his Alfred Dunhill cashmere coat - has shown that British men can wear it, too. And they love him for it. The current issue of the totemic lad mag Loaded, for example, describes Snatch as \"the crowning and probably final moment of gangster fashion\". Meanwhile, FHM devotes a dozen pages to the film's key characters in its fashion section. Inside you can read how the Savile Row tailor and unflagging self-publicist Ozwald Boateng provided bespoke costumes for Lock Stock's original cast of \"authentic\" tough guys. </p> <p>If that's not enough evidence of the film's fashionable influence, go out tonight and observe twentysomething males queuing up to be first to take in Ritchie's latest and note how the British gangster movie's essential accessories - shiny loafers, pressed shirts, glinting boxes of 20 B&amp;H - are influencing our nation's smart-casual sensibility. </p> <p>Never mind the fact that real east-end petty criminals prefer to go to work in grubby Air Maxes and lurid Puffa jackets; faux cockney-criminal chic lets you look: a) sharp, b) a little bit tasty, and c) like a proper geezer - and who can complain about that? </p> <p>In retrospect, this state of affairs is the logical conclusion of a succession of gangster looks that film-makers have brought us over the past decade. It began with the hugely influential Reservoir Dogs and the slimline white-shirt, black-tie outfits worn by its protagonists. The get-up offered a knowing nod to the seedy glamour of Sinatra's Rat Pack and showed a generation of formalwear-phobic young men that suits wouldn't necessarily make them look like accountants - or, worse, schoolboys. </p> <p>A raft of cheapo sub-Tarantino crime flicks experimented with variations on the same sartorial theme, while several British-made gangster films, before and after Lock, Stock, tried to give the suit a comparably iconic presence. For the average movie-going geezer, though, Brit gangster fashion was always a little bit outre and risque, and had too many echoes of mod and 60s flamboyance to make the leap from screen to high-street store; you could happily admire it and buy the poster, but you wouldn't want to emulate it through your wardrobe. What Ritchie has done is domesticate the gangster look, make it safe for the fashion-fearing modern man who thinks being seen in pinstripes is as emasculating as arriving at the pub with a pink poodle. </p> <p>Effecting this shift has been something of a triumph - which is precisely why it is so depressing. \"I reckon if you get too interested in clothes, it all starts getting a bit fruity.\" That's the enlightened line Ritchie takes in September's FHM. You might have thought that his settling down with the most audacious, fashion-friendly pop star of the last 20 years would have broadened his style horizons, but you'd be wrong. \"Frankly,\" he continues, Madonna \"would have me dressed up like a poof if she could\". The godfather of Brit gangster chic sounds like an uptight estate agent after a few too many at the cricket club - a million miles from the iconic movie gangsters of the past. </p> <p>In Scorsese's Casino, Robert De Niro may have been hard as nails, but that didn't stop him wearing Dame Edna sunglasses and primary-coloured pimp suits. Even the macho supermen of 70s blaxploitation flicks such as Black Caesar found the time to invest in some decidedly \"fruity\" ruffled shirts and velvet jackets. Movie gangsters of old strutted like peacocks and preened themselves like poodles; they pushed the fashion envelope just as they tested the farthest limits of the law. They had a fatalistic, forbidden glamour. These days, we have to make do with geezerdom instead. </p> <p>Thankfully, there is a glimmer of hope for those of us bored silly by the nightclub bouncer-meets-monied-football hooligan look of gangster chic and, more importantly, its trickle-down effect on British menswear in general. The cultural swing back to modern tailoring - something often touted in recent times - is finally gathering some real momentum. Richard James and Gieves &amp; Hawkes, both purveyors of finely crafted, grown-up menswear, have just opened flagship, central-London stores and won acres of approving magazine coverage by doing so. Burberry, too, is enjoying a new wave of interest in its classic cuts. And a cover story in the latest issue of money magazine Forbes Global heralds the renaissance of \"dressing down in style\", arguing that the demise of the suit as a workplace uniform, combined with a growing awareness among men of the potential for elegance and individuality offered by a properly made two-piece signals a shift in style choices in the west. If that trend expands, it means a new dawn in fashion for men who go to a tailor with confidence, rather than those who need to buy their self-assurance and masculine credentials off the shelf. It's about time. </p> <p>In 1986, Madonna recorded a song called White Heat, a tribute to James Cagney in the 1949 gangster classic of the same name. The chances of her recording a comparable tribute to the verve and panache of her husband's leading men - say, Vinnie \"You're the Bollocks, Innit\" Jones - look decidedly slim. And on that note, what's the likelihood of Brit gangster chic going down in the histories of timeless screen style? As Al Pacino said in Donnie Brasco - slumped on the flock sofa in a hideous tracksuit, but still knocking the style spots off the Snatch mob - fugedaboutit.</p>",
  "<p>Not since Saatchi &amp; Saatchi launched its ill-fated bid for Midland Bank has the advertising industry been seen to embrace consolidation so enthusiastically. Having lagged behind the companies they serve for more than a decade, ad agencies have in the past year rushed to buy, or be bought, in an often bewilderingly rapid feeding frenzy. </p> <p>This activity is a belated mirroring of what has been happening among their multinational clients. As global industries consolidate, they are looking increasingly for a single company that will cater for all of their ad requirements worldwide. It means there are fewer, but much larger and more lucrative, ad accounts in play, so smaller agencies will find it more difficult to survive as global clients seek to work with the biggest global agencies.</p> <p>According to Paul Richards, a media analyst at stockbroking firm WestLB Panmure, the other major factor behind the drive to consolidate is a desire for economies of scale. \"Each of the big groups wants to have two, maybe even three, global ad agencies. It's not just ad agencies - economies of scale are particularly important to media buying agencies. And there's a whole range of below-the-line activities - healthcare, PR, direct marketing - that clients now expect their agencies to offer.\"</p> <p>But until recently, ad industry efforts to consolidate have been severely hampered by conflicting client interest. Advertisers do not like to use agencies that work for rivals in their sector, just as they rarely employ professional advisers who work for direct competitors. A proposed merger between the French group Publicis and Young &amp; Rubicam of the US was scuppered recently when Y&amp;R's biggest client, Ford, objected on the grounds that Publicis handles ads for rival car manufacturer Renault.</p> <p>Perhaps the most notorious example is Procter &amp; Gamble. As the world's biggest advertiser, it wields enormous power over its agencies. Until recently, P&amp;G refused to allow its four main agency networks - Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, Grey Advertising, Leo Burnett and MacManus - to belong to the same holding company as an agency handling competitor's work. The most extreme illustration of P&amp;G's draconian rules came when Saatchi &amp; Saatchi demerged from Cordiant Communications in 1997 because its status as a P&amp;G roster agency meant Bates Worldwide - Cordiant's other agency network - could not pitch for any household product advertisers.</p> <p>But early last year P&amp;G, realising that its rules meant it no longer had the world's biggest and most powerful agencies on its roster, let it be known quietly that any moves towards expansion would be looked on favourably. This has acted as a catalyst to industry consolidation and, in the past year alone, the balance of power has changed dramatically.</p> <p>The first P&amp;G agencies to oblige were the US groups MacManus (owner of the UK's D'Arcy and IMP agencies) and Leo Burnett, which owns the UK agency Bartle Bogle Hegarty. Last November, the two of them linked up with Japan's largest ad agency, Dentsu, to form the oddly-named B Com3 (according to its founders, the name is derived from \"beacon\"). B Com3 is now the world's fourth-largest ad organisation, behind Britain's WPP and Omnicom and IPG of the US, and it is expected to use its forthcoming flotation to bankroll further acquisitions.</p> <p>It was assumed that Saatchi &amp; Saatchi would follow suit and merge with Grey Advertising, which is publicly quoted but controlled by its 73-year-old chairman and chief executive, Ed Meyer. But in June Publicis, having lost out on a deal with Y&amp;R, surprised the industry by launching a $2bn (\u00a31.3bn) friendly takeover of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi. The move created the world's fifth-largest ad company, with substantial media buying interests in the form of Publicis' Optimedia and Saatchi &amp; Saatchi's 50% stake in Zenith Media.</p> <p>Earlier in the year, Publicis scored a coup when it bought the privately-owned US ad hot shop Fallon McElligott - known for its award-winning creative work. But this proved to be a mere hors d'oeuvre for the French group's acquisition-hungry chairman, Maurice Levy, who has seen Publicis leap up the global agency rankings - from tenth to fifth - in less than a year.</p> <p>But the most dramatic shift in the global agency rankings came in May when the London-listed WPP group added Y&amp;R to its two agency networks: J Walter Thompson and Ogilvy &amp; Mather. The $4.7bn (\u00a33.2bn) deal meant WPP leapfrogged its two US rivals, Omnicom and IPG, to become the biggest ad services company in the world. The merger created a gold standard by giving WPP many of the biggest names across all marketing disciplines, including direct marketing and media buying. </p> <p>WPP is now expected to merge its media arm, and the world's largest media specialist, MindShare with Y&amp;R's the Media Edge - ranked fourth. For the year to December 31 1999, the combined group had revenues of $5.2bn (\u00a33.5bn).</p> <p>In addition to bringing three of the world's leading ad agencies under one roof, the deal united four of the biggest public relations agencies: WPP's Hill &amp; Knowlton and Ogilvy Public Relations, and Y&amp;R's Burston-Marsteller and Cohn &amp; Wolfe, as well as Y&amp;R's below-the-line agency, Impiric, and WPP's OgilvyOne.</p> <p>So, after contenting itself with two agencies for years, WPP has fallen into line with the US trend of having three. Both of the other ad super-groups - Omnicom and IPG - adopted the three-legged model in the 1990s. IPG departed from the norm last year when it merged Ammirati Puris Lintas with Lowe, but that was in anticipation of acquiring another agency.</p> <p>The multi-agency structure makes sense because it allows companies to take on conflicting business by keeping their agency subsidiaries separate. But even this system has its limitations. Even though P&amp;G has softened its conflict policy, any links between its agencies and those that handle work for its biggest rival Unilever are still out of the question. And car manufacturers, particularly in the US, still insist on the rigorous demarcation of agency groups, with General Motors using Interpublic, Ford employing Y&amp;R and Daimler Chrysler using True North Communications. </p> <p>Nevertheless, WestLB Panmure's Richards believes there is considerable scope for further consolidation. He says: \"It's still a very fragmented industry. WPP, the biggest player, still has only a few per cent of the total market, so there is room for a lot more consolidation. Cordiant and True North is a likely deal. They are two medium-sized agencies and, geographically speaking, they are a good fit. Cordiant is strong in Europe but weaker in the US, whereas True North is strong in the US but needs to improve its European capability. Grey is a good match for Publicis Saatchi.\"</p> <p>Cordiant chairman Michael Bungey admitted recently that he had held talks with True North, and a string of recent acquisitions suggest he is fattening up the company for a sale. Cordiant executives are thought to be holding out for the \u00a31.2bn Publicis paid for Saatchi &amp; Saatchi - a company of a similar size. The group is also thought to have held talks with IPG, which has been seeking a major acquisition since its attempts to buy MacManus failed last year. Either way, Cordiant is unlikely to remain independent for long. And once it has been snapped up, only one top 20 UK agency - M&amp;C Saatchi - will remain independent.</p> <p>It is a far cry from 15 years ago, when the UK top 20 was dominated by home-grown independent agencies such as Dorland Advertising (now Bates UK) and BMP, now part of Omnicom's DDB network, and the UK outposts of US ad giants such as JWT and O&amp;M.</p> <p>The Saatchi brothers, following their unceremonious ousting five years ago from Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, the agency they built up from scratch, are expected to think carefully about ceding control of M&amp;C Saatchi. But, realistically, their attempts to build a global network are unlikely to succeed in the face of competition from the new super-groups. Recent press reports suggest M&amp;C would consider joining the new Publicis/Saatchi grouping, although this theory seems to owe more to the famous Saatchi spin than good commercial sense.</p> <p>Ironically, it was Saatchi &amp; Saatchi that started the trend towards industry consolidation when, more than a decade ago, it embarked on an ambitious buying spree aimed at turning it into a global one-stop shop for business services. The agency expanded from ads into direct marketing, sales promotion and PR, before coming unstuck when it tried to move into financial services. Now it seems Martin Sorrell, former finance director at Saatchi &amp; Saatchi and now chairman of WPP, is showing them how it is done.</p>",
  "<p>The all-conquering march of the internet has triggered a media acquisition spree. Dot.coms and software companies have pushed stock markets on both sides of the Atlantic to unprecedented levels of wealth, allowing ambitious broadcast and internet companies to pounce on their targets through paper takeovers.</p> <p>Highly-valued shares are used as currency in these bids, resulting, for example, in the blockbuster, \u00a3220bn all-share merger earlier this year between internet company AOL and media giant Time Warner.</p> <p>But the key to this year's media frenzy, which has seen more than \u00a3290bn worth of mergers and acquisitions, is a revolution in content distribution. Broadband access allows film, television, music and radio content to be downloaded from the internet, creating the perfect e-commerce opportunity for any media company.</p> <p>It also adds a much-needed perspective to the bewildering amount of cash being thrown at start-ups that have yet to make a profit. Last year, Yahoo! paid \u00a33.5bn for Broadcast.com, which has posted nothing but losses throughout its short existence.</p> <p>The AOL and Time Warner deal combines blockbuster brands such as CNN, Netscape, Warner Bros, CompuServe and Time Magazine. According to the new company, it also created \"the world's first fully integrated media and communications company for the internet century.\" </p> <p>Time Warner's CNN.com and Entertaindom.com sites will get priority on AOL space; with AOL taking advantage of Time Warner's Road Runner broadband network. </p> <p>Companies are virtually guaranteed larger profits and increased market share if they control both distribution and content. Walt Disney is a prime example, having launched a series of canny takeovers throughout the 90s. It owns film and production companies (Touchstone Pictures and the ABC Entertainment Television Group), which supply programmes to the television network (ABC), which in turn helps to promote Disney's cable channels (ESPN, Lifetime Television, E! Entertainment Television and The History Channel). And these cable channels have tie-ins with Disney's book publishing division, Hyperion. </p> <p>These synergies keep every aspect of a media company's products in-house, ensuring no money is lost through licensing or outsourcing.</p> <p>Britain does not have a big hitter in the AOL or Time Warner league, but there is plenty of room for consolidation, and for companies on the merger trail to snowball. Newly-demerged Granada Media recently paid \u00a31.75bn for the Meridian, Anglia and HTV ITV franchises owned by United News and Media.</p> <p>Granada always wanted to be the leader of the pack in the rush to shake up ITV, which is facing a surge in competition from hundreds of digital and cable channels. The company owns TV interests Granada, LWT and Yorkshire-Tyne Tees and has the cash and boardroom expertise to grow, particularly if media ownership regulations are relaxed.</p> <p>Granada will have to sell one of United's franchises, probably HTV, as the Broadcast Act dictates that a company must not have more than a 15% audience share. Elsewhere, local radio station owners cannot own local newspapers in the same region.</p> <p>These regulations allow a broad range of media voices to be heard, but prevent companies from growing into global players, such as France's Vivendi. Granada's \u00a37bn value is dwarfed by AOL Time Warner's \u00a3220bn price tag, and Vivendi's \u00a362bn. </p> <p>Juggling the need for diverse output and to nurture globe-straddling companies is a factor being considered in a white paper being put together by the department of culture, media and sport and the department of trade and industry.</p> <p>British media companies should follow developments across the channel, where Vivendi and its Canal Plus pay-TV unit paid \u00a319bn for Canadian spirits and entertainment group Seagram. This represents Europe's most impressive response to the AOL/Time Warner merger, in combining Seagram's massive entertainment portfolio, including the Universal film and music businesses, with an internet and telecommunications network. </p> <p>Vivendi's ambitious chairman, Jean-Marie Messier, wants to establish a foothold in Britain. He has already established the Vizzavi internet portal with Britain's largest company, mobile phone giant VodafoneAirtouch, and could try to form an alliance with BSkyB.</p> <p>BT will be one to look out for next year, when the broadcasting ban on its networks is lifted - making it an even more attractive takeover target. If BT can ward-off predators with a restructuring programme, its fledgling Yes Television arm could provide Murdoch with serious competition.</p> <p>Another likely participant in the takeover battles to come is the FTSE-listed, \u00a314bn media company RTL, which spans 11 countries. Channel 5's major shareholder - a combination of Pearson's TV business and Luxembourg-based broadcaster CLT-Ufa, owned by the Bertelsmann empire in Germany and GBL of Luxembourg - is a dark horse in the media mega-merger race. And RTL is determined to increase its intimidating size through acquisition. </p> <p>Only 10% of the company is being floated and its war-chest will be built up as more shares are offered to investors. Any company with the combined firepower of Financial Times-owners Pearson and Bertlesmann will have a significant role in the balance of European media power.</p>",
  "<p>The world is in the grip of merger mania, with European link-ups and buyouts alone worth a mammoth \u00a3400bn so far this year. The corporate marriages and takeovers are seen as the best way to generate short-term profit growth and grab greater market share.</p> <p>The sky-scraping sums generated by these deals also guarantee publicity in an environment that is not renowned for its scintillating news stories. </p> <p>The link-up between US internet giant AOL and multimedia conglomerate Time Warner hit the headlines for creating a company worth a staggering \u00a3220bn. The takeover saga involving Vodafone AirTouch and Germany's Mannesmann, meanwhile, was a multibillion pound soap opera, with the final price escalating to \u00a3114bn.</p> <p>But mergers are risky, time-consuming and do not have a good track-record. A recent study by accountancy firm KPMG found that 83% of mergers did not improve shareholder value. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation &amp; Development says the number of mergers is rising, but they often fail to increase profitability. The main obstacles include staff defections, company integration and the domestic and EU regulatory maze.</p> <p>The merger process is secretive, with big-name advisors such as Merill Lynch and Morgan Stanley keen to protect clients' business strategies; not wanting to lose lucrative merger business. Banks advise on every part of the process, particularly the chances of the deal being knocked back by regulators.</p> <p>One adviser says: \"Mergers are very complicated and you have to do so many things right, such as integration at every level and agreeing a price. They are not easy things to complete.\"</p> <p>Even if the tricky obstacles of price and integration are overcome, there is the unpredictable factor of what the regulators will say. Broadcasting regulators put paid to the proposed marriage of ITV franchise holders Carlton and United News &amp; Media and a link-up between US telecoms giants Worldcom and Sprint was torn apart by EU officials. If a merged company threatens to monopolise its sector, it will go the way of Microsoft and be broken up.</p> <p>\"People are now much more wary of competition issues, because of the mergers that have been put on hold. Directors end up doubting if they should go ahead, particularly if you're six months down the line in a merger and suddenly you are not allowed to do it. There may be some good reasons for blocking it, but six months is a long time,\" the advisor adds.</p> <p>But the real danger that lurks within mergers is integration. Another recent KPMG survey found that 80% of a deal's value stems from having a successful integration strategy, including the sharing services and removing duplicated departments or jobs. A US study of 500 mergers in the banking and insurance sectors shows companies that develop integration skills are more likely to perform well after the deal is completed. A prime example is BMW's takeover of Rover, which was a fiasco from day one because the German car giant failed to impose its management culture on Rover, allowing it to drift towards receivership.</p> <p>The advisor continues: \"Some mergers come unstuck, and it is easy to knock them. If you look at Vodafone AirTouch and Mannesmann, you see that they can be a huge success if the companies integrate well.</p> <p>\"But it is the management culture that drives mergers and integration, as there need to be similar cultures within the two organisations. It's a matter of the management making the deal work.\"</p> <p>These challenges do not put off corporations, because there is constant board-level pressure to deliver short-term growth. A successful link-up will give company profits a shot in the arm by providing access to an established revenue stream and customer base. In addition, the stock market likes winners, and being the senior partner in a merger makes a company look confident and exciting. Then there is a psychological factor a work: companies hate to look as though they are missing out on a trend or falling behind their competitors.</p> <p>The pressure to exploit the true value of a merger is intense. While the timetable for these deals is not set in stone, the board must produce \"value\" as quickly as possible. A common target is to triple revenue within the first year or two of a merger or acquisition. Failure to realise these aims damages market confidence in a company and makes the chief executive's position uncomfortable.</p> <p>There are a lot of considerations, but business is all about taking risks and in mergers the cost of failure and success is directly proportional.</p> <p> REASONS FOR MERGING</p> <p>1) To improve market share by accessing new markets. 2) To acquire new brands or take control of competing products. 3) To improve the company's infrastructure, particularly in relation to IT or technology. 4) To reduce costs and boost efficiency. 5) In the interests of globalisation and to increase the company's international reach.</p> <p> MERGER TYPES</p> <p>There are three types of merger, although the time-scale to complete the deal, and the regulatory rules in each sector, may differ.</p> <p>Horizontal: This is when a company links up with another one that is at the same production level - for example, a car manufacturer merging with another car manufacturer.</p> <p>Vertical: This is when a company merges with another one that is at a different stage in the production cycle. A forward vertical merger is one stage ahead, such as a car manufacturer taking over a car hire company; a backward vertical merger might involve a manufacturer taking over a tyre factory.</p> <p>Conglomerate integration: This is when two companies with no apparent links merge.</p> <p> What you need for a merger:</p> <p>1) Squads of lawyers: do not even think about going near a merger target without a team of lawyers to tell you what to do, guide you through regulation hell and stand in the corner looking as though they know better than you - which they will.</p> <p>2) Loads of cash: lawyers are not cheap, and neither are cash takeovers. Also, a failed merger bid will knock millions of pounds off a company's stock market value. So line your pockets.</p> <p>3) Lucky horseshoe: there are several committees and institutions waiting to pore over mergers or takeovers, and it is sometimes impossible to tell if they are going to block the deal. Good luck charms will not sway the secretary of state for trade and industry, but they will make you feel better.</p> <p>4) Accountant: ensure your money-man is good, as the sums of money involved are terrifying and you have to squeeze every last penny of shareholder value out of the deal. Cross-border revenues will drop you in a tax quagmire, which could affect the balance sheet.</p> <p>5) Decent restaurants: never negotiate over the telephone. It is always best to hammer out a corporate marriage over a plate of foie gras on a bed of distressed cous cous, because it makes you look important, and you can stick the crippling wine bill on expenses.</p> <p>6) A public relations company: these days financial PR companies are a dime a dozen, but they are vital for presenting the deal, keeping blood-hound journalists at bay and getting that all-important stock market approval. A sceptical market could scupper a paper merger.</p> <p>7) A graphic designer: your new company will need a logo and name. The Nike \"swoosh\" was designed by a student for \u00a325, but be prepared to shell out a lot of money if you want your brand to have a better reputation than Dunlop Green Stripe.</p> <p>8) A fondness for Belgium: if you think the euro is the fifth horseman of the apocalypse, then you are in for a rough ride. More and more mergers straddle international borders, are conducted in the single currency and fall under EU jurisdiction. So stop muttering about the war and get your Berlitz guides out.</p> <p>9) Driver: you need to look official as you travel from air-conditioned office to restaurant to country seat, so make sure you have a driver or your merger partner may develop status issues. </p> <p>10) Integration strategy: Ensure you know what will happen to the staff and IT systems of both companies, because a deal can look good on paper but promptly fall apart through a corporate culture clash.</p>",
  "<p>Shadow chancellor Michael Portillo was yesterday facing a fresh \"conflict of interest\" row with his \u00a310,000 consultancy for an American oil and chemical giant clashing with his launch of a Tory campaign to axe Labour's new energy tax. </p> <p>Mr Portillo will be limited under Parliament's strict advocacy rules from initiating any action in the House of Commons because the Kerr McGee Corporation would be one of the companies hit by Labour's climate change levy which targets chemical giants. </p> <p>The US firm - which has extensive interests in the North Sea oilfields - also backs the US policy of trading \"emission permits\" which Mr Portillo enthusiastically supported during an interview on the BBC Today programme yesterday. </p> <p>\"The Americans have a very good idea for the control of emissions and I think that is one of the routes we should go,\" he said. \"They issue permits for people to emit, to put gases into the air and then there's a great incentive on those businesses to reduce their emissions because they can sell those permits on to others ...\" </p> <p>He added that it did not require \"all the administration and bureaucracy, civil servants and waste\" entailed in the government's complicated tax proposal. \"If we are going to be a prosperous nation and we're going to create wealth in order that we can have good public services, we have to be first of all a competitive country,\" he said. </p> <p>The tax was likely to drive business away from Britain to countries where energy practices were less efficient. \"Therefore there will be a net loss to the global environment,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Portillo has already had to apologise for not declaring his connection with the oil group when he condemned petrol tax rises in the Commons. Then Christopher Leslie, Labour MP for Shipley, called on him to resign his consultancy. </p> <p>Last night another Labour MP, Fraser Kemp, who represents Houghton and Washington, said: \"The public are entitled to know that when Mr Portillo is talking on behalf of his party or the country that he is being paid by a foreign multi-national. He should either resign his consultancy with Kerr McGee or resign the shadow chancellorship. He cannot have two jobs.\" </p> <p>The financial secretary to the Treasury, Stephen Timms, criticised Mr Portillo's plans. </p> <p>\"Climate change is one of the biggest challenges facing the world today,\" said Mr Timms, who added that using the climate change levy as a means of tackling the problem had been negotiated extensively with businesses. </p> <p>Business groups gave the Tories' plans a cautious welcome. John Cridland, deputy direc tor-general of the Confederation of British Industry said: \"This is a useful contribution to the debate that pinpoints many of our current concerns.\" </p> <p>Chris Humphries, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \"It appears the Opposition has embraced wholeheartedly many of the concerns we have already raised over the regulatory and tax burden faced by UK businesses, though more detail is necessary before business can reach an informed view.\"</p>",
  "<p>Yesterday Michael Portillo inadvertently raised the key question of the century. Can western democracies ever deliver the politics necessary to save the world? To stop global warming as it is now - just to halt it - world emissions of carbon dioxide have to be cut by between 60% and 80% according to the intergovernmental panel on climate change: targets set at Kyoto which some countries won't reach were a pathetically modest first step. But outside wartime, no democracy has ever asked its voters for such savage belt-tightening or such radical lifestyle change as would be required to get anywhere near that goal. </p> <p>Will it have to wait until citizens can see for themselves that climate change threatens them now, not in the future? Dying polar bears, water at the north pole, fires blazing across great tracts of land or even tropical diseases like West Nile fever breaking out in Boston make interesting newspaper stories, but they don't scare the people into a wartime frame of mind: presumably that will take water flooding over the spire of the Empire State Building. </p> <p>Michael Portillo yesterday said the Conservatives would abolish Labour's climate-change levy, a pollution tax that after three years of negotiation finally comes into force in April. It will create energy savings worth about a third of the Kyoto cuts Britain has to make in carbon emissions. It is not draconian, adding only 0.45p per unit to business energy bills. It will raise \u00a31.1bn, all of it to be recycled back to business. (It is not a Treasury money-maker). All employers will get the money back as a reduction in National Insurance contributions they pay for employees. The idea is an incentive to cut energy use, coupled with an incentive to employ more people.Ten per cent of it will be used for energy saving capital grants for business. </p> <p>This policy was led by Lord Marshall, then head of the CBI. It has undergone years of delicate negotiation to ensure it is fair. Industry persuaded Gordon Brown to halve the size of his original levy, making special agreements for 80% rebates for sectors that use vast quantities of energy but employ few people - steel, chemicals, engineering. Yesterday John Cridland, deputy director-general of the CBI, said it was not opposing the climate-change levy. </p> <p>The one and only supporter of Portillo's surprise announcement was the Institute of Directors. (Small business stands to gain from the NI cuts). Portillo's rousing rhetoric at the breakfast for business included these thoughts: \"There is no justification for an energy tax which is going to be particularly harmful to manufacturing industry. Business can no longer be the fall guy.\" He called the idea of taxing manufacturing industry \"ill-conceived\", \"counter-productive\" and \"crazy\". (Both he and the institute talked of manufacturing industry's dire plight due to the high pound, apparently shameless about their own part in Britain's failure to join the euro and rescue British manufacturing). </p> <p>But most important of all, Michael Portillo took no account of global warming. He simply criticised the levy as a tax on business. It is politics as usual, no change. At least, unlike the Republicans in America, the Conservatives don't deny the existence of global warming, nor the need to do something about it. But as oppositions do and always will, they deny the need for a particular belt-tightening measure the government of the day proposes. It's \"crazy\", needless, could be done better or in any other way but the one proposed. There will be a great array of methods governments choose to apply carrots and sticks to drive down energy use to hit their targets. But if oppositions always offer the people an excuse for not doing it, a reason for voting against any particular tax, quota or limit, nothing will be done. </p> <p> Portillo's \"alternative\" suggestion is typical weaselling. Instead of a tax, he said, his party would introduce \"emissions trading\" whereby companies are given carbon quotas they can buy and sell. It gives them a financial incentive for switching to more expensive clean energy sources such as wind or solar power that fall outside the quota. Good idea. Except that the government is already planning to do this and has a taskforce in place drawing up just such a scheme. So is the EU. But it will be needed side by side, not instead of, a climate-change levy because it wouldn't work without that incentive. It will take several years to introduce, during which time Portillo proposes nothing should be done. The danger is that in democracies people are easily seduced by apparently pain-free alternatives offered by oppositions, ensuring governments never quite dare take measures as tough as they know they should be to hit their targets. And that's the way the world ends. </p> <p>Consider the sort of lifestyle change we in the west will have to make to meet the 60-80% cut: a one-way flight from London to Miami uses up half the carbon emission a person would be allocated for a whole year's heating, cooking and transport. Will it require authoritarian national governments to introduce those kinds of severe changes, or can oppositions behave more responsibly and sit down with governments to agree global-warming measures? The Conservatives' desperate thrashing around at the moment for any vote-catcher, however disgraceful, doesn't bode well. </p> <p>Must it all be hard sacrifice? There's always a glint in the eye of the Greens that suggests they really relish anti-materialist, back-to-nature lifestyle cuts as a puritanical good thing in its own right. However, it is possible that a mixture of good government and new technology will mean nothing too drastic has to hit general standards of living. But as Michael Portillo must know, the longer action is delayed, the harsher the cuts that will need to be made later. </p> <p>The climate-change levy is an excellent tool to start large energy users thinking again about ways to convert their supplies to clean sources and to use less. For example, it will tip the balance in making it financially worthwhile for a new office building to invest in solar panels as a cladding that would give the building 30 years free electricity at no greater construction cost than most ornamental but useless cladding. (It looks like blue marble). The levy would tip the balance in encouraging any large energy user to invest in solar panels. The government is to use 10% of the levy for grants to help companies install this and other clean electricity supplies. </p> <p>The difference in cost between clean and dirty electricity is shrinking all the time, so that relatively small extra taxes can change energy use dramatically. How high do oil prices rise before electric cars look attractive? Maybe we shall fly less often, but then trains will improve to take up the international long-distance trade. But carrots and sticks will have to start the whole process. And oppositions that try to capitalise shamelessly on what all responsible governments must do deserve to be kept out of office indefinitely. </p> <p> polly.toynbee@theguardian.com</p>",

  "<p>E-commerce firms could exploit monopoly powers to rip off consumers, the office of fair trading warned yesterday. </p> <p>\"Competition authorities worldwide are facing the challenge of ensuring e-commerce flourishes in a competitive environment,\" said John Bridgeman, director general of fair trading. \"The balance to be struck is that of protecting consumers without stifling innovation.\" </p> <p>Setting-up costs on the internet are comparatively low, which should promote competition, but the OFT said firms that grab the limelight by being the first to enter an area of e-commerce might gain an entrenched position. </p> <p>\"Reputation, branding and customer loyalty will become increasingly important and may create significant first-mover advantages,\" the OFT said. It also noted that many online markets tend to be natural monopolies. </p> <p>The good news for consumers, according to the OFT, is the internet will make it easier to compare prices in a global market place and buy from the cheapest supplier. It was examining existing rules to ensure it was monitoring e-commerce effectively. </p> <p>\"Whether existing competition law is up to the task of dealing with this new and constantly evolving market is an issue being considered by many competition authorities.\"</p>",
  "The UN's global compact initiative (Getting into bed with big business, August 31) is not a sinister deal with \"the world's biggest and most controversial corporations\", but incorporates business, international unions and civil society groups based on the universal declaration of human rights, the International Labour Organisation's fundamental principles and rights at work and the Earth Summit's agenda 21 principles on the environment. <p>George Monbiot's suggestion that Kofi Annan allows multinationals to deflect \"pressure from single-issue groups\" will be of interest to such naive organisations as Amnesty, Human Rights Watch and the ICFTU global trade union confederation which also support it. They accept the global compact's recognition that voluntary agreements \"are no substitute for action by governments\". But such groups believe the compact can initiate meaningful dialogue on developing global rules for a global economy. </p> <p>The global compact website provides access to agreements between unions and multinationals incorporating core labour standards as well as details of disputes and allows activists to take part in \"cyber pickets\" of firms violating labour rights. Hardly a corporate front organisation. Multinationals are not omniscient, monolithic and malevolent. Monbiot's view promotes a false dichotomy between passive resignation and the facile oppositionalism of recent \"anti-capitalist\" indulgences. The more productive route is through the tedious, demanding long slog of constructive engagement. </p> <p> <b>Michael Allen</b><br> Centre for Strategic Trade Union Management Cranfield University  <a href=\"mailto:M.Allen@cranfield.ac.uk\"> M.Allen@cranfield.ac.uk</a></p>",
  "Take away the anti-semitic \"literature\", the white supremacist flag and the fact that he is railing against blacks and Jews, and it might be possible to believe that Shaun Winkler cares about nothing so much as the state of your lawn. <p>Sheltering in the shadow of a court building against 80 degrees of afternoon sun, the young landscape gardener certainly looks the part: his T-shirt torn and dirty, his work boots heavy, his combat trousers slack and baggy. But this week Winkler is proud to abandon his career on the land for a holiday spent standing up for what he believes in. And what he believes in, above all else, is his mentor, the Rev Richard Butler, founder of the Aryan Nations and an all-round racist, bigot and hate-monger. This, should there be any misunderstanding, is a description borrowed from Butler's lawyer. </p> <p>Business is going well enough for the God-fearing Winkler, though fear is probably an emotion stirred more readily when the church you attend every Sunday has as its centrepiece a bust of Adolf Hitler. \"I go to people's houses, they call me up and ask me to come back again,\" he says. \"I must be doing something right.\" Any non-white customers might not agree, but that is beside the point: he doesn't have any. Non-whites are statistically negligible in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, and if it were otherwise Winkler would not choose to live in this town. </p> <p>Business for Butler, on the other hand, has never been worse. Twenty-five years after he moved to northern Idaho, a finger of land inserted between Washington state to the west, Montana to the east and Canada to the north, his movement is close to being crushed. His foe is not the wave of racial impurity, against which he has inveighed for so long, but the law, albeit in an action brought by a Jewish civil rights attorney. Morris Dees is attempting to bankrupt Butler by suing him and his organisation for damages to a mother and son who claim they were terrorised by Aryan Nations guards outside the Butler compound two years ago. </p> <p>A daily ritual is enacted in and around the Kootenai county court building in Coeur d'Alene, a town of 30,000 where the local fetish for huckleberry jam and milkshakes is balanced by an inordinate number of pawn shops. About two-dozen policemen start to assume their positions before dawn, the road outside the courthouse barricaded off and four or five more officers with binoculars on the roof of the building. </p> <p>Then there is nothing to do but wait until Butler, whose original calling was as an aeronautical engineer in California, is driven to the hearing in an aged Ford truck spewing toxic fumes and bearing licence plates proclaiming Idaho's motto: \"Famous Potatoes.\" Inside, the case proceeds, often assisted by evidence from tattooed former members of Butler's posse despite the high price he places on the virtue of fidelity. </p> <p>Forty-four-year-old Victoria Keenan claims that she stopped late one night outside the compound in Hayden Lake, a few miles north of Coeur d'Alene, to retrieve a wallet that her son, Jason, aged 21, had dropped from the car. </p> <p>The sound of her 1977 Datsun backfiring was the signal for three guards to descend from the Aryan Nations camp, chase them for more than two miles, fire at least five bullets and beat them up. \"Because you're white we're going to let you live today,\" one guard is said to have told them. Two of the guards are in jail now and the other is on the run. </p> <p>The Keenans, who say they suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder, are looking for unspecified damages. If the jury sees things their way, an award, likely to be made in the middle of next week, could leave Butler with no choice but to sell the 19-acre compound, valued at $240,000. This would not be enough to cover his liability, but would deprive the white supremacists of their core and rallying point. </p> <p>Butler at first had trouble at first finding a lawyer. But now his defence is in the hands of Edgar Steele, who argues that the civil rights squad is attempting to turn a trivial matter into an assault on liberty: \"It is still legal in this country to be a bigot. It is still legal to hate. Butler quite properly erects the twin defences of both free speech and religion contained within the first amendment [guaranteeing freedom of expression]. </p> <p>\"Here we have a case involving two people whose presence at the entrance to the Aryan Nations in the dead of night is at least questionable, who get chased and given a good fright by rowdy members of the Aryan Nations, acting well beyond the scope of their authority, who sustain no physical and highly questionable psychological injuries.\" </p> <p>Outside in the street, Winkler the gardener is enjoying the attention and reflecting on his creed. \"I came here because there were too many non-whites in Pennsylvania. I saw non-whites commit crimes against our people and I decided to take a stand for what I think is right. It's not because they're black; it's their culture. They're animals. They're savages.\" </p> <p>Winkler explains how he became involved with white power groups at the age of 15 when he was taken to a Ku Klux Klan rally. \"There was this nigger state trooper and he told us to take off our hoods and the guy I was with said to the nigger: 'You try to take off my hood and I'll punch you out.' Yeah, they took him away.'\" </p> <p>The gardener was arrested himself two years later. \"That was just because of the communist police we have in this country.\" Still, it could be worse. \"I heard that in German now you can't even give a Sieg Heil salute without being arrested.\" But now the small talk has to stop because the court is about to adjourn for the day and that means it's time to put on a show. First there is a hunt for some bagels, which are torn into pieces so that they may be thrown at the Jewish civil rights lawyers. Then more skinheads arrive and a small corridor is formed. Above it are the Aryan Nations banner and three Confederate flags. </p> <p>A man in his late 30s appears on the scene to give the zealots a pep-talk. He tells them: \"I don't want to see you guys yelling and screaming and getting arrested because we're better than that.\" Out comes Butler with his cropped white thatch, shuffling his way towards the arthritic Ford, his right hand raised towards his supporters. The old man with the complexion of dried orange peel is helped into the truck and off he goes back to the compound, which is guarded by his three German shepherd dogs, Fritz, Nazi and Hans. They are there to protect the church with the Hitler bust, his offices lined with extremist tracts, the watchtower, the men's and women's barracks and the shower area with a red swastika on the roof. His followers are left to trail across the car park opposite the courthouse, chanting a ragged anthem. Four of them get into a new green Buick and drive away, pausing only to wave pedestrians across the road in front of them. </p> <p>It is easy to see why Butler's lawyer wants to make much play of his contention that his opponents are trying \"to paint this rag-tag band of borderline derelicts as a highly organised, well-trained and disciplined military organisation\". But Aryan Nations is taken seriously enough by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms: seven \"photographers\" covering the case had their media credentials removed after it emerged that they are actually federal agents. </p> <p>And Steve Judy, the town's mayor, cannot bear the image of Idaho as a playground for racists as well as the more innocent outdoor types drawn to its 18m acres of protected wilderness. \"Human rights groups outnumber hate groups here 10 to one,\" says the mayor. \"Richard Butler is not that big a deal. We're talking about nine people living there full-time. The biggest problem is the message of hate he sends out and the link to our region.\" </p> <p>It is true that until this point nothing has been pinned on Butler personally. But moonlighting Ayrans were among members of the Order, another far-right group, which murdered a Denver talk-show host and conducted a string of violent robberies in the 80s; members of the Aryan Republican Army, responsible for 22 bank raids 10 years later to finance a white revolution, were linked to Butler; and Bufford Furrow, who is accused of wounding three children and two adults at a Jewish community centre in Los Angeles last year before murdering a postman, is a former Aryan Nations security guard. </p> <p>Whatever the outcome of the court case, no matter the future for Butler, buffoon or soldier for a caucasian nirvana, Winkler the gardener is not going to go away. \"They can take our land, but they can't take Aryan Nations from our hearts.\"</p>",
  "<b> Age: </b> 62. <p> <b> So what's the big deal? </b> Packer just blew \u00a313.6m in a three-day Las Vegas baccarat extravaganza. </p> <p> <b> Hey, big spender! </b> One of the biggest. Last September he blew \u00a311m at Crockford casino in London - the largest single loss in British gambling history. Packer gambles as much as \u00a3100,000 per hand, and may have two hands going at the same time. He once, famously, lent the actor George Hamilton \u00a3125,000 in chips, then refused repayment. </p> <p> <b> A generous man then. </b> Packer is Australia's richest man, worth some \u00a33bn. His media empire, Publishing and Broadcasting, owns Nine Network television station as well as, coincidentally, Australia's largest casino. \u00a313m? Peanuts to Kezzer. </p> <p> <b> And is he also a king of hearts? </b> In a manner of speaking. Packer has suffered eight heart attacks and claims to have been declared clinically dead on October 7 1990, following a cardiac arrest. </p> <p> <b> But is his a heart-warming rags-to-riches story? </b> You bet. Once upon a time, old grandfather Packer found a 10 bob note on a Tasmanian street. He bet it on a horse, paid his boatfare to Oz with the winnings, and started the family business. </p> <p> <b> So he's hardly one of life's losers. </b> Oh, no.

We can only assume that this time he was out of film. </p> <p> <b> And does Packer play with the big boys? </b> Kerry is reputedly numero uno on the world's list of 150 \"whales\" - players who regularly win (and lose) obscene amounts of money. Other big cetaceans include the Sultan of Brunei and arms dealer Adnan Kashoggi. For these whales, perks include free use of the casino's presidential suite and private jet, plus an instant credit line of \u00a33.5m.
