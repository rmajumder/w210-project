  "<p>Rt Hon Tony Blair MP Prime Minister; Leader of the Labour Party (1). <br> </p> <p> Rt Hon Gordon Brown MP Chancellor of the Exchequer (3).<br> </p> <p> Alan Greenspan Chairman, American Federal Bank Reserve (7).</p> <p> The man revered as the architect of the unprecedented economic boom in the US is facing his biggest test. His every pout, strut, and subtle change in syntax or vocabulary is analysed and counter-analysed by global markets. His greatest test may come after next month's Presidential elections. The Fed, although politically independent, has held off from changing interest rates in the run-up to the polls. Greenspan, originally appointed by Ronald Reagan, was accused of losing George Bush Sr the 1992 election after interest rate hikes just before the poll. With the US trade deficit spiralling out of control and growth still stellar, Greenspan will be responsible for 'the soft landing' of the economy. Despite all the adulation he has received in the past, it is this job which will prove the ultimate test of his mythical abilities, and may prove the difference between global boom or global slump.<br> </p> <p> <br> Steve Case Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, AOL; chairman designate, AOL-Time Warner (59). </p> <p> If, in 10 years' time, the impact of the internet amounts to a fraction of the wild claims made for it now, then much of the credit will go to Steve Case. The proposed \u00a3128 billion merger of his company, America Online with Time Warner, itself trying to merge with UK music group, EMI, represents the first conjuncture of old and new media. He barely registered on last year's list but this year he was the star of the show at the Davos World Economic Forum, eclipsing even Bill Gates, and he was proclaimed king of the new establishment by the US glossies. The creation of AOL-Time Warner is the practical manifestation of digital convergence. Television, movies, music and computer games will be available on demand in homes over high-speed data links. Case was in a position to broker the deal because AOL was among that rarest of breeds: the profit-making internet company.<br> </p> <p> Alastair Campbell Press Secretary to the Prime Minister (5).<br> </p> <p> Sir Eddie George Governor, Bank of England (8). <br> </p> <p> 'Steady but ready' Eddie's influence over interest rates has strengthened over the past year. He has made the casting vote in the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee on at least two occasions, keeping mortgage costs constant since February. Sir Edward became Governor of the Bank of England in 1993. His term was renewed for a further five years in 1998, his powers then greatly enhanced by Labour's granting of operational independence to the Bank in 1997, but weakened by the removal of regulatory powers over the financial sector. Last month he helped coordinate an international effort to prop up the ailing euro. But he is a noted eurosceptic, and as the Chancellor has tempered his euro-enthusiasm, and the economy prospered, so the relationship between the two men has improved. They now get on well. </p> <p> Bill Clinton President of United States of America (4). <br> </p> <p> Clinton's foreign policy often lays the foundation for the UK's. Labour modelled its election campaign on the 1992 Clinton victory; Blair used Clinton to promote peace in Northern Ireland. The United States dominated Nato policy over Kosovo, refusing to deploy US ground troops. Refused to assist Blair to forge a republican compromise on the RUC issue, which Clinton thinks should be addressed as outlined in the Patten report. Recently his influence in the Mid-East has been questioned. Such is the ephemeral nature of political power that Clinton - whose term ends in January- is unlikely to figure in this list next year.<br> </p> <p> Bill Gates Chairman, Microsoft (2).<br> </p> <p> The past 12 months have not been a great year for the world's richest man. The software guru has suffered the ignominy of having his company branded a monopoly by the US government which is now examining ways of breaking the firm up. Nevertheless Gates, 44, is still worth more than $60bn and it is far from certain that Microsoft will do the splits. Slow to realise the importance of the internet, Gates is now refocusing Microsoft into a company which aims to write the code for the next generation of internet-compatible devices. Disliked by some for the way his company has dominated the industry, Gates, married with two children, does not outwardly give the impression of being a bully. Quiet and reserved Gates has pledged to give away 95 per cent of his wealth to civic and philanthropic causes when he dies.</p> <p> Rupert Murdoch Chairman and Chief Executive, News Corporation (6).<br> </p> <p> Four million daily Sun readers and the 700,000 Times readers. His Sunday Times and News of the World are formidable money-making machines. In BSkyB Murdoch has 40 per cent and effective control of Western Europe's most profitable broadcaster. Was diagnosed with low grade prostate cancer recently, so speculation mounts that he is grooming a successor. His son Lachlan was last week appointed deputy at News Corp and seems the sibling most likely. As the election nears there will again be speculation as to the influence Murdoch wields over his editors.<br> </p> <p> <br> Sir John Browne Chief executive, BP Amoco; Trustee of the British Museum (23).</p> <p> It has often been said of Sir John Browne that he wields more power and has more influence over our lives than the aver age minister. After September's fuel crisis demonstrated Government impotence in guaranteeing petrol supplies, and its inability to force oil companies to ensure them, the Prime Minister may himself ruefully reflect on the truth of this remark. Browne has built BP from an important, but second tier oil company, to a global 'supermajor' capable of competing with the likes of Exxon. Two significant deals - the purchase of US oil company Amoco for pounds 30bn in 1998 and its subsequent acquisition of Arco pounds 18bn - have propelled the company to a market value of nearly pounds 138 bn and to the second slot in the FTSE 100 index. </p> <p>Highest new entry<br> John Chambers President and CEO, Cisco Systems Inc. </p> <p> Chambers, 51, is the man who wired the world. His company, Cisco, makes the hardware and software which powers the internet. It does all the back-end, boring stuff which means that it is set to benefit massively from the demand for e-business solutions. 'Are you ready?' runs the company's ads heralding the internet revolution. Cisco certainly was and its share price soared 50,000 per cent in a decade. Chambers is the internet revolution's biggest cheerleader and is the biggest critic. Cisco became the most valuable firm in the US earlier this year when it temporarily overtook Microsoft. </p> <p> <br> Chris Gent Chief Executive, Vodafone (31).</p> <p> UK's market leader in mobile phones, Vodafone's coup de grace was the takeover of German telecom company Mannesmann, valuing it at more than \u00a382 billion. Has become the world's biggest mobile phone operator.</p> <p> Rt Hon Peter Mandelson MP Northern Ireland Secretary (25).</p> <p> Returned to Cabinet after only 10 months in wilderness. After initial success, the peace process now seems precariously balanced in the face of Unionist opposition and republican refusal to compromise.</p> <p> Jonathan Powell Downing Street Chief of Staff (9).</p> <p> Became Tony Blair's chief of staff in 1995. Acts as the PM's fixer, liaising with civil servants, and behind-the-scenes Northern Ireland envoy. Refuted allegations that he masterminded whispering campaigns against Mo Mowlam and Frank Dobson. </p> <p> Nobuyuki Idei President and CEO, Sony Corporation (154).</p> <p> Leader of the world's largest corporation since 1995. Sony pioneered the video recorder, Walkman and Mini-Disc. His are the slogans 'Digital Dream Kids' and 'ReGeneration'. </p> <p> Greg Dyke Director General, BBC (11).</p> <p> His appointment provoked William Hague to spend \u00a3100,000 on media analysts to monitor BBC output. Drastic shake-up is already under way, with rout of middle management. He has even banned croissants at morning meetings to save costs.</p> <p> Marjorie Scardino CEO, Pearson (48).</p> <p> First female executive of a FTSE 100 company. Former Chief Executive of the Economist, her influence as head of a company that owns the FT, Economist, Penguin Books, Baywatch and Madame Tussaud's secured her number eight slot in Fortune 's list of most powerful women. Shares have doubled in two years.</p> <p> Rt Hon David Blunkett MP Education and Employment Secretary (27).</p> <p> Has direct responsibility for two of the government's key policies: raising school standards and New Deal. Launched inquiry into the marking of national curriculum tests for 11 year olds, and has introduced 'citizenship' classes.</p> <p> Rt Hon John Prescott MP Deputy Prime Minister; Secretary for Environment, Transport and the Regions (13).</p> <p> Presides over an annual transport budget of pounds 3.7bn and housing budget of pounds 2.4bn. Joined Brown behind the 'forces of privilege' campaign. Offered somewhat too eagerly to take reins in running the country so Blair could take paternity leave.</p> <p> Gerry Robinson Chairman, Granada Group; Chairman, Arts Council (39).</p> <p> Granada own a third of the ITV network. At the Arts Council Robinson is in charge of pounds 384 million of government and lottery money. Sits on the Creative Industries taskforce. </p> <p> Rt Hon Jack Straw MP Home Secretary (28).</p> <p> Remains a figure of calm as storms rage over Labour but...criticised over watering down of Freedom of Information Bill; under pressure to introduce race reforms in the wake of the Lawrence report; criticised over Asylum Bill and voucher system for refugees. </p> <p> Rt Hon Robin Cook MP Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Secretary (44).</p> <p> Has been kept busy with Zimbabwe, Sierra Leone and Chechnya, and has frozen military exports to Zimbabwe. Has been pressing Blair to enter the European single currency at an earlier date.</p> <p> Paul Dacre Editor, Daily Mail (19).</p> <p> The Mail outstripped the Daily Mirror's circulation for the first time in 1998, selling 2,421,319, the second highest among UK dailies. Instigated anti-GM foods campaign. Jumped on the asylum-seekers bandwagon, portraying many of them as bogus and thieves.</p> <p> Sir Richard Sykes Chairman and Chief Executive, Glaxo Wellcome (22).</p> <p> Appointed by Blair to the Council for Science and Technology, he opened the Edward Jenner Institute for vaccine research, to which Glaxo contributed pounds 10m. In May 1999 was named Business Leader of the Year. Paid pounds 3.63m last year.</p> <p> <br> Sir Richard Branson Founder &amp; Chairman, Virgin (32).</p> <p> Recently sold extracts of his autobiography Losing My Virginity to the Sun while a rival paper extracted Tom Bower's less flattering and unauthorised biography. Still hoping to land licence for National Lottery. </p> <p> Sir Peter Bonfield Chief Executive, British Telecommunications; Non-executive director, AstraZeneca (26).</p> <p> BT Cellnet will have stolen a march on competitors if its launch of the UK's first high-speed internet access succeeds.</p> <p> Lord Derry Irvine of Lairg QC Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain (33).</p> <p> Introduced Tony Blair to Cherie Booth when they were pupils in his chambers. His changes to the trial-by-jury system provoked outrage, especially from the Law Society. Now looking at judicial appointments after objections to his own choices. </p> <p> Wim Duisenburg President, European Central Bank (35).</p> <p> Dutch ex-banker now dubbed Mr Euro. Low value of the currency has adverse effect on UK exports to Euroland. The ECB faces allegations of lack of transparency in terms of policy and interest-rate decisions.</p> <p> Gerhard Schroder Chancellor, Germany (12).</p> <p> Glossy election campaign won him power and tag of 'Herr Blair', he took over a delicate role in European politics and an economy with 10.6% unemployment - 5m people. Hit early on by the departure of finance minister, Oskar Lafontaine, due to policy divisions. </p> <p> Ed Balls Chief Economic Adviser to Gordon Brown (45).</p> <p> One of a handful of people the Chancellor will listen to, Balls is a prime mover behind the Americanisation of Labour economic policy. Regarded as 'deputy chancellor', he sees every key Treasury paper and is an advocate of welfare-to-work and promoting individual opportunity.</p> <p> Philip Gould Strategic Adviser (60).</p> <p> One of the architects of New Labour, key adviser to Tony Blair; married to Gail Rebuck of Random House. Gould is one of the most important people in Blair's inner circle.</p> <p> <br> Mark Moody-Stuart Group Chairman, Royal Dutch Shell (77).</p> <p> His reforms have upturned Shell's fortunes. Despite efforts to repair relations with the Ogoni people of Nigeria over the past two years ending in violence, with Ken Saro-Wiwa's successor being charged with murder and arson, Moody-Stuart has been hailed as succeeding in shaking up the Anglo-Dutch group and making it perform.</p> <p> Terry Leahy Chief Executive, Tesco (15).</p> <p> With a p\u00a3500m investment programme that will see 22 new stores and 10,000 new jobs, Leahy looks set to ensure Tesco retains its number one slot with 15% of the grocery market. Member of Demos think tank and the government's competitiveness taskforce.</p> <p> David Yelland Editor, the Sun (54).<br> As editor of the best-selling daily tabloid his influence will grow as the election looms and as the debate over the Euro becomes sharper. </p> <p> <br> Sir Robert May President designate, Royal Society; former Chief Scientific Adviser to the Government; Head of Office of Science and Technology (34).</p> <p> Argues for increased government funding for research, and more openness with scientific advice given to government departments. Co-wrote (with Liam Donaldson) report on GM foods, recommending surveillance but also saying there's 'no current evidence' of harmfulness. </p> <p> <br> Louis Gerstner Chairman and CEO, IBM (93).</p> <p> Heading the US computer giant since 1993, he has taken its total assets to $86bn.</p> <p> <br> Michael Eisner Chairman, Walt Disney Corporation (47).</p> <p> In his 14-year tenure Disney's market value has risen from $2bn to $75bn. But he lost in legal battle against former deputy Jeffrey Katzenberg over loss of earnings.</p> <p> <br> Steve Jobs Interim CEO, Co-founder Apple Computer Inc (68).</p> <p> Back in the limelight, turning the fortunes of Apple around with the new iMac. Results show increased demand for PowerMac G4 and new PowerBooks. </p> <p> <br> Linus Torvalds Programmer; originated Linux operating system (153).</p> <p> Bill Gates's nemesis: a Finnish student who wrote an operating system to run his own computer seven years ago and then publicised its code on the internet so other programmers could copy, refine and develop it. Linux, the free operating system became the favourite of geeks and system operators and has reached critical mass as many of the largest software and hardware makers announced plans to offer customers Linux-based products. System took pounds 1.25bn worth of business from Microsoft's Windows last year.</p>",

  "<p>The internet revolution, say the pundits, raises the possibility of the virtual organisation, allowing people to work from home, their back gardens or even their favourite holiday destinations. The era of the interconnected, wired corporation will see the end of the traditional boundaries between home, the workplace and leisure. </p> <p>If this were true, it would dramatically affect all our institutions. It could be truly stated that the information age is structured on quite different principles from those of the industrial economy. Commuting, like the office block and the central business district, would be a thing of the past. Congestion and traffic pollution would disappear. The very basis of urbanism as a way of life would be redundant. </p> <p>How realistic is this scenario? For a start, it is questionable whether knowledge-based jobs will be in a majority. Other workers - check-out staff, healthcare workers, teachers and those delivering personal services - will always need to travel to work to earn a living. But even for knowledge workers, it is unlikely to be the end of commuting to work. </p> <p>This is because the modern corporation can only be competitive through continuous innovation. </p> <p>Innovation depends on creativity. And a key factor in creativity is sociability. So although knowledge employees may technically be able to work from home, it will re-main necessary for them to meet each other, to interact and to brainstorm. It is through face-to-face contact between colleagues that ideas for new products, business leads and problem-solving emerge. This makes the physical workplace just as important in the future organisation as now. How do companies encourage sociability? </p> <p>The first step is to create effective team dynamics in which personal compatibilities are as important as technical skills. Witness how this is given priority by advertising agencies, publishing houses, R&amp;D departments and sales teams. Colleagues need to get on with each other and have fun together. </p> <p>Consider also workplace architecture. Many companies are redesigning their workplaces around centrally located cafes to encourage socialisation between colleagues who would otherwise rarely meet. In their physical layout, management consultancies and software design firms often resemble airport lounges with their sofas or-ganised around vending machines. </p> <p>For many companies, geographical location is regarded as of utmost importance, even in this age of the much-heralded death of distance. Again, this is to encourage sociability. The reason so many knowledge-based businesses remain in London, despite its congestion and high rental costs, is the cluster factor. The proximity of pubs, restaurants and wine bars enables colleagues to stay in contact out of work. From this, many new business ideas develop. </p> <p>Move to an out-of-town site with excellent facilities and lower costs and the business can die because of the lack of after-hours informal socialisation. For this reason Philips moved some of its design functions from Eindhoven to Amsterdam. It offers a buzz that attracts young creative staff as well as an infrastructure that allows it to flourish. </p> <p>For many companies, corporate events are organised to foster employee sociability. Although the formal agenda may be to approve strategic plans, their real contribution is to bring together colleagues who would otherwise never see each other. This is particularly important for global corporations. Their project teams may be organised to interact through internet technologies but for trust and the exchange of ideas to develop, periodic face-to-face sociability is vital. </p> <p>All such approaches to encouraging sociability at-tempt to nurture tacit knowledge - to encourage colleagues to understand how others work. This strengthens our own personal competencies but at the same time makes us inter-dependent. Because we work well together, we become good at this because others are good at that. I can concentrate on developing my strengths and so can you. We understand how each other thinks and how we each prefer to do different things in an informal but clearly understood division of labour. Only face-to-face sociability allows this to happen. </p> <p>This is why some high-spending football clubs fail to realise their true potential. Buying star players is not enough. Look at Chelsea. To be successful, each player needs to understand how his teammates think. On-the-pitch training is not a substitute for socialisation - which is why many managers turn a blind eye to some of their players' extramural antics. </p> <p>Equally, corporate success is not achieved by hiring superstars. The real key to high performance is combining in-dividual talents through shared understanding and 'hidden' tacit knowledge gained through intense or-ganisational sociability. Many small firms are good at this, particularly if they are located in geographical clusters that facilitate after-hours contacts. </p> <p>Internet technologies will change the ways we work. We will work more from home and communicate with colleagues across greater distances. But this will not make the workplace redundant. Rather, workplaces will be-come think-tanks to stimulate corporate creativity and innovation. Generating and managing tacit knowledge through colleague sociability will be a major challenge. A revolution in management practices will be required if sociability is to be combined with the internet to achieve competitive success. </p> <p><strong>It's a dating agency, a social circle... and a job</strong></p> <p>As old forms of community break down, people are increasingly reliant on the workplace for sociability and a sense of belonging, according to a report by careers consultancy Sanders &amp; Sidney. </p> <p>The report, Friendship Works, shows that sociability is an important element in people's decision to join - and stay with - a company and commit themselves more to work. Two-thirds of respondents said that a sense of community compensated for discontents such as pay. </p> <p>The office has also become much more than a place to work; 80 per cent of employees make friendships that extend beyond the office, and a quarter meet their partner there. Although the report finds that friendship and community have strong business benefits in staff retention and motivation, only 8 per cent of organisations have formal policies for fostering them. A resounding 94 per cent of employees think their employers are missing a trick.</p> <p> Richard Scase is author of Britain in 2010 (Capstone Publishing, 2000) and a professor at the University of Kent</p>",
  "<p>If your boss is unusual within the organisation, don't allow yourself to be riled. Treat his comments as a joke, tug your forelock and take your inspirations to someone senior to him.

  "<p>The government this week took another step back in its plans to authorise hundreds of thousands of new homes amid intense pressure by countryside campaigners. </p> <p>It delighted the Council for the Protection of Rural England (CPRE) by announcing that the number of extra new homes needed in the north-east will be much lower than it originally indicated. </p> <p>A panel of independent experts, appointed by the government to scrutinise local authority development plans, has taken a cautious approach, in effect saying the region must wait and see if regeneration works before hugely increasing the number of homes. The panel also wants more effort made to stem the outflow of Geordies from the region. </p> <p>The publication of draft regional planning guidance for the north-east was welcomed by the CPRE, which called for the earlier targets for new homes in the area to be lowered. </p> <p>In the original regional planning guidance, councils and other agencies identified a need for another 119,000 new dwellings over the next 20 years to cater for the predicted population growth. But the panel was unconvinced by planners' arguments. Even though there are more owner-occupiers in the north-east than 20 years ago the region still suffers from the decline in manufacturing industries and has large pockets of unemployment. Instead, the panel said an additional 110,000 dwellings would be needed between 1996 and 2016. </p> <p>Around the country independent panels are examining draft planning guidance for each of England's regions, paying close attention to regional targets for new homes. After a public hearing the panel's recommendations are passed to the environment secretary John Prescott for his approval. </p> <p>In the south-east, the publication of the panel's recommendations caused an uproar when it called for 1.1m homes over the next 20 years to allow the economy to prosper. Mr Prescott attempted to soothe countryside campaigners and councils in March with a draft response containing more modest targets. He rejected the panel's recommendations, instead plumping for 860,000 homes. </p> <p>The new figure was still more than the 660,000 homes proposed by Serplan, which represents councils and other parties with an interest in planning for the south-east. Mr Prescott tried to quell dissent by insisting the new homes would need to be built on the same \"footprint\" as the 660,000. In practice this means developments should be higher density and more akin to the terraces that characterised Georgian and Victorian London than the sprawl associated with Brookside Close and modern suburbia. As further evidence of the government's commitment to regenerating cities, 60% of the new homes would be built on recycled or \"brownfield\" land, he said. </p> <p>By the summer, it was the turn of the south-west to come under the microscope. Here planning inspectors also caused a storm when their report concluded that building the equivalent of 10 cities the size of Exeter, some 407,000 new homes, was necessary over the next 20 years. In this instance the panel wanted 40,000 more than the councils in the area said should be built. </p> <p> Nic Best of the CPRE's north-eastern region says there are deep contradictions within the process for reviewing new house building plans. \"Each of the regional planning panels is setting up housing targets without relating it to other regions,\" he says. \"The south-east wants to build houses for the people it expects want to come and live there in future. But the north-east panel wants homes for people it ex pects to stay put,\" he explains. </p> <p>The developers and councils argue that building is needed to support regeneration. A larger stock of good quality housing is needed to entice people to an area. </p> <p>But Mr Best says it is not that simple. CPRE is not against regeneration: \"After all, it's more sustainable if people live near where they work. But we want to see if the number of people leaving the north-east eases off, if the regeneration plans work and migration falls before we build too many new homes,\" he says. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Mr Prescott's ministry, the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, has introduced safeguards to protect the countryside from urban sprawl. All plans for developments of 150 homes or more on greenfield sites must now come before Mr Prescott before local authorities can give them the go-ahead. </p> <p>The move means developments who do not abide by new rules on density and type of land used can be stopped in their tracks. Ministers want to ensure that all developments, even those that have been in the pipeline for some time, reflect latest government thinking on planning. </p> <p>The circular will convince councils and developers that the secretary of state means business on protecting the countryside, says Julie Stainton, planning officer for CPRE. \"Even if they have already allocated a site for development they must review it. They can't say they have a plan and will stick with it until it expires,\" she says. </p> <p>The Housebuilders' Federation says developers are doing their bit to protect the countryside. Spokesman Pierre Williams says that the industry has almost reached the government's target of 60% of development on recycled land. \"The industry is building 58% of homes on brownfield sites. The largest builders such as Barratt are managing 70%.\" Mr Williams says the industry needs more financial incentives to develop sites previously used for another purpose. \"More funding is needed to make unviable brownfield sites worth taking on. Builders won't take on sites that cost more to develop than they can earn in sales.\" </p> <p>The housebuilders say that some local authorities are us ing the new emphasis on using recycled land to stop all development, an approach they condemn as short-sighted and disastrous for the economy. \"If the cities are seen to decline people will want to move out to find a better quality of life. There will always be demand for a certain amount of greenfield land to meet this need.\"</p>",
  "<p>It took a while for Rupert Murdoch to warm to Jean-Marie Messier, the Frenchman who runs Vivendi. Talks between the two about combining their pay television operations ended acrimoniously. Mr Murdoch was not happy when Mr Messier parked his tanks on News Corp's lawn by buying up 20% of BSkyB. </p> <p>More recently, relations between the two have reportedly been less strained. Mr Murdoch, who has been a late convert to the internet, may have viewed Vivendi with its telecoms and web portal businesses as a useful ally to have. </p> <p>Vivendi was to have been a significant shareholder in Sky Global Networks, News Corp's deliberate attempt to court new media companies by bundling all his satellite interests into a new company. The plan is (or was) to float this business later this year. </p> <p>Mr Messier though is now turning his back on News Corp and shedding his stake in BSkyB for what the Frenchman views as a bigger prize. The result is a blow for Mr Murdoch and seems to underscore again the feeling that the once all-powerful media mogul is drifting from the centre of things. </p> <p><strong> Neuer thinking </strong><br> </p> <p> A \u00a31bn offer is now on the table, but shareholders in the London Stock Exchange were distinctly unimpressed yesterday. It appears they are grateful to the Swedish raiders OM for horning the planned merger with Deutsche B\u00f6rse out of the ring. But that also appears to be where support for OM ends. </p> <p>The prospect of swapping their shares for volatile OM paper appears to leave them cold. However strong the OM arguments are - and the aggressive offer document landing on desks around the City yesterday contains many - the young management of OM look unlikely to win over the City old guard. Price, perhaps, does not matter now. </p> <p>This is a fillip for Don Cruickshank, the LSE's bruised chairman. But he and his management team (still lacking a chief executive) should not be complacent. They are still only halfway through the bid timetable and, as yet, we have only seen the scratchiest details of a credible future strategy. </p> <p>Mr Cruickshank seemed to be thinking along the right lines a week ago when, addressing an audience in Brussels, he mapped out some ideas on a pan-European extension of the Techmark concept of a growth-focused index (drawing on the quality assurances. </p> <p>This is fertile ground. With tech stocks taking a mauling in the market, he should now be pointing out to his audience all the inadequacies of Germany's upstart Neuer Markt which are now being painfully exposed. </p> <p>Start-up ventures listed in Frankfurt seem to be collapsing with alarming frequency and speed. That, together with gaping regulatory holes (such as the ability of certain \"insider\" shareholders to sell stock without informing the market), make it likely that investor confidence in Neuer Markt-listed issues will melt away just as quickly as it appeared. </p> <p><strong> Next steps </strong><br> </p> <p> At last we have the proof. Sir Richard Greenbury - who is still stoutly defending his record as Marks &amp; Spencer chairman - was wrong. Splashing out \u00a3192m for 19 Littlewoods stores (which had a book value of just \u00a380m) three years ago was not \"the key to sales growth and aggressive expansion\", as he described it at the time. </p> <p>It was a very expensive mistake and one which, with the glorious benefit of hindsight, perfectly illustrates the \"we can do no wrong\" arrogance that spelled Marks &amp; Spencer's subsequent fall from grace. </p> <p>It was a grave error. In many key towns and cities M&amp;S split its merchandise between two sites. Women and children in one outlet, menswear and home furnishings in another. In one ludicrous case womenswear and childrenswear found themselves separated by an entire shopping centre and a walk up the road. Surprise, surprise the store with no womenswear - the driver of the entire business - suffered badly. </p> <p>Belatedly, M&amp;S is about to put that right, shutting down 12 of them. (Three, by the way, never even got an M&amp;S fascia). But another problem looms, in the form of its rival Next marching into former C&amp;A outlets to compete on the same-sized stage. This is a retailer with real confidence and growing sales. </p> <p>But hold on - haven't we been here before? Three years ago, the do-no-wrong men from St Michael marched into under-performing Littlewoods stores, insisting that size did matter. </p> <p>Next is moving in on underperforming C&amp;A outlets mumbling the same mantra. Next's chief executive David Jones has made it clear he just wants bigger stores in the same locations, not twin fascias in the same towns. </p> <p>Let us hope he is not tempted to change his mind or history might repeat itself.</p>"
