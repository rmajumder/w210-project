  "<p>On the face of it, the new economy looks like a nirvana for women. The skills required for success are cerebral (ideas generation, IT knowledge) or semi-social (networking, team-building). And the entrepreneurial spirit required to jump the \"not com\" old economy corporate ship and establish a start-up seems to reside in the X chromosome: US women are in the forefront of new business creation and British women are not far behind. </p> <p>The technological slaying of distance, with websites and email allowing new economy recruits to work as and where they please, is particularly helpful to women trying to marry paid work with childcare. Throw in some glamour in the shape of Martha Lane Fox and the feminisation of the new economy seems complete. Women sick of banging their heads against the glass ceilings of the old economy can give it up as a bad job and join the flexible, gender-neutral new one instead. </p> <p>Except things aren't quite as they seem. The surface impression of a new dawn of gender equality does not fit with the reality of the changing economy. Helen Wilkinson, a writer on gender and technology, argues that a harsher dot.com environment means women are struggling to establish themselves in start-ups. \"The new economy looks good for women on paper - technology allows new ways of working, creating the potential for better work-life balance,\" she says. \"But start-ups require a huge initial investment of time and energy, meaning long working hours. The dot.com culture is still quite male-oriented and in a climate in which investors are cautious, there is a tendency to go with safe options.\" </p> <p>Wilkinson points out that the venture capital firms backing dot.com start-ups are dominated by men; the specific IT skills required for website building and e-commerce are still being acquired by more men than women - indeed the number of women applying to study IT has dropped slightly. And while the image of the new economy worker logging on from home seems attractive, the truth is less futuristic: a study by the Institute for Employment Studies found that women telecommuters were three times more likely than men to be interrupted by children. </p> <p>Perhaps most importantly, the working culture of dot.coms is more macho than the old economy, with the possible exception of City trading rooms. Start-ups operate in a go-go, flat-out climate and the line between success and failure is often so narrow - and the gains from stocks options so great - that working all the hours God sends is entirely rational. Far from prefiguring a feminine future, dot.commery is fuelled by testosterone and takeaways, with friends and lovers found in the late-night office and \"start-up sex\" made more exciting by the shared sense of pace and risk in many e-ventures. </p> <p>In the US, there are signs of a backlash against start-up craziness. The initiatives to reduce pressure on employees speak volumes about the levels of insanity. Justin Kitch, founder of <a href=\"Homestead.com\" target=\"_NEW\">Homestead.com</a>, decided to rebalance his life when he got married, cutting back his office hours to just 60 and putting in, on top, a mere 20 at home. Charlie Kim, head of Next Jump, which produces online college guides, told Fast Company magazine he was cracking down on long hours by banning sleeping in the office and removing all beds and futons. </p> <p>On this side of the pond, too, the atmosphere of dot.coms remains relentlessly macho. Employees boast of pulling \"all-nighters\" - an activity once reserved for just-in-time essay production at university. </p> <p>Of course, it is not just men who are adopting a work-all-hours approach - Lane Fox herself rises at dawn, rushes around until dusk and puts in more work in between than most of us manage in a week. Which is fine until children appear on the scene because women still have most of the childcare responsibilities and the dot.com culture is about as family-unfriendly as you can get. </p> <p>Without relinquishing their command of the old economy, men are colonising the new one, too. Far from narrowing the gap between men and women, the rise of the dot.com is in danger of widening it.

  "<p>In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread.\" When God felt wrathful, one of the worst of his punishments, in the case of the snake, the tree and the apple, was to condemn humankind to work. The primal curse today typically lasts 80,000 hours in a lifetime. That sounds like one hell of a punishment and in a sense it is. It consumes physical and mental energy, fills our conversation - and yet it takes up barely 12% of the average allotted span on earth. So is 80,000 hours a big number or not and how angry was God? Work is said to be in the throes of a massive upheaval, but compared with the past, how much of a revolution are we really seeing? </p> <p><strong> There's no job security</strong></p> <p> We may feel insecure but the idea that we have lost the common expectation of a job for life is a myth. Go back 100 years and uncertainty and casual employment were the norm. To some extent, it's a myth perpetuated by the memory the labour movement and trade unions have of their own history. Many developed on the strength of organising workers in, say, the coal industry or shipping and protecting members in those trades all their working lives. But then, as now, most people did different jobs for different employers. There is little evidence of a fall in job tenure which remains at between three and five years. </p> <p><strong> Lads get left behind</strong></p> <p> Unskilled young men are seen as the disaffected casualties of the modern economy - and they often have been. Before the first world war, there was great agitation about the \"boy worker problem\". Boys leaving school at 14 with few, if any, qualifications were drifting into jobs as messengers, for example, which left them time on their hands to loiter in the streets. Youth clubs and Scouts appeared around this time, in part in the hope that they could instil in the yobs some notion of civilisation. There is no evidence this generation grew up more degenerate than any other; whether saved by the Scouts, we can only guess. </p> <p><strong> Stress levels are rising</strong></p> <p> Unlikely. One in five of us now suffers from workplace stress, so we're told. But conditions in the past could be atrocious. The memory of the Depression encouraged some to take whatever work they could get, to stick with it and be thankful. Piece-rate payments and perpetual insecurity could leave workers anxious and under the cosh. There was not much recourse for bullying or sexual harassment, either - now the tribunal would beckon. If there is a rise in stress, it is often driven by ambition, or among select groups such as teachers who are subject to greater scrutiny than in the past. </p> <p><strong> We're all working harder</strong></p> <p> In fact, we have never had it so easy. At the beginning of the 20th century, children would typically start work at the age of 13 or 14 and stay there until 65 or older. Today it's normal for people to stay longer in full-time education and (the occasional bout of summer pint-pulling excepted) not enter the labour market until their early 20s, before retiring commonly by the age of 60. So the typical working life has shrunk from around 50 or 55 years to around 38 - a massive reduction. </p> <p>Not only are our working lives shorter but so are our working hours. A hundred years ago, people would in all likelihood have been working a six-day week. That had come down to five and a half days by the middle of the 20th century and it is now down to five. </p> <p>Those working days are shorter, too. After the first world war, they fell by around seven or nine hours per week, then fell again after the second world war from around 54 hours per week to 46 or 48; in the past 30 years or so there has been a steady decline from around 44 hours to around 37 today. The perception that we are working harder is often associated with progress in our career as we acquire increasing responsibility and seniority, rather than with any aggregate change across the economy. </p> <p><strong> Modern jobs? McJobs!</strong> </p> <p> If McJobs are seen as our future, they are also our past. Services are not a modern invention: the last great surge in the service economy was in the late 19th century when there was a boom in pubs, similar to the revival of pubs, bars and the cappuccino economy today. It has been said that jobs in Indian restaurants now outnumber those in steel, mining and shipbuilding put together, and there has been a big change here. But it is not unprecedented. There was a swift retail expansion in the late Victorian era, too, with the first big movement towards working and buying in the high street. Regional financial centres began moving to London and northern manufacturing wealth was already being eclipsed by the south. </p> <p>The modern domestic service boom was also prefigured about 100 years ago. There is some truth in the idea that more of us are becoming wedding video-makers, aromatherapists or one of the thousand other consultants as we seek out a specialist service niche. But specialisation has been around since Adam Smith in 1776. In the past you might have been a ponty-sticker, a doctor maker, a butt woman or maybe one of the 60 or 70 different and equally forgotten occupations listed in a turn-of-the-century census of the shoe-making trade alone. </p> <p><strong> Home-working is here</strong> </p> <p> There is some evidence of an increase in teleworking (for instance in Finland) but not much. Rates in the UK are little changed; self-employment levels actually show a slight fall. To insist the brave new world is possible because of new technology is to forget that jobs from fur-pulling (plucking out the long hairs to make smoother pelts) to chain-making were carried out at home in the past. The latter, done in the back yard, was a woman's job because it could apparently be combined (goodness knows how) with childcare. Work and a home life of leisure were slowly separated over the centuries. If they do begin to merge again, it'll be a return to ways of old. </p> <p>Our difficulty is to reach beyond the postwar imagery that informs most living memory of what work means. The longer sweep of history suggests that few trends in the labour market are new. And if in the future we fear a life without work, bear in mind a forecast by American economist Paul Krugman: the jobs that flourish will be the ones information technology can't foreseeably replace. So it's goodbye accountants and office workers, and welcome back... gardeners. God really was angry. </p> <p>\u0095 Additional reporting: Michael Blastland.<br> Tinker, Tailor, Teleworker, presented by Evan Davis and produced by Michael Blastland, begins on BBC Radio 4 at 8pm tomorrow.</p>",
  "<p>Quality watchdogs have warned UK universities to tread carefully as they move into lucrative new markets for overseas students, in the aftermath of a report criticising the University of Derby for the poor standards of students enrolled on degree courses established in Israel.</p> <p>The Derby case is the latest of a small but damaging number of scandals where UK universities have been found to be mismanaging franchised operations abroad. </p> <p>Following the prime minister's calls for the UK to capture a larger share of the global higher education market, universities now have their sights set on large untapped student markets in China, India and Japan. </p> <p>But the chief executive of the Quality Assurance Agency for higher education, John Randall, has warned that institutions should be careful not to sacrifice standards in the rush to recruit fee-paying overseas students.</p> <p>\"There are a number of possible lucrative markets emerging,\" says Randall. \"But anyone who wants to operate in the market should do so properly and responsibly. If one institution gets it wrong it can blow the reputation for the whole of the UK academic community.\" </p> <p>Last year the prime minister unveiled bold new targets for UK universities to attract a quarter of the world's share of international students by 2005. International students represent one of the fastest-growing revenue streams for UK universities, bringing an estimated \u00a31.5bn annually into academic coffers. </p> <p>Since Derby restructured its operation following concerns raised by the Israeli higher education authorities, the running of the courses has greatly improved, says the QAA in its report published last week.</p> <p>But the investigators uncovered a number of disturbing instances suggesting poor quality control of the courses run in partnership with the Israeli Inter College. Some students could not speak English to the standards required for entry. At least one student graduated with a degree after only one year of study.</p> <p>In April 2000, there were some 6,400 students registered for University of Derby degrees at Inter College, which was set up in 1996 by three private Israeli education organisations to run the courses. </p> <p>\"The inquiry came to the general conclusion that the link with Inter College was established without sufficient care and prudence and, initially, was managed in a way that did not secure the quality and standards of the programmes offered,\" concluded the QAA report.</p> <p>Last year the QAA criticised the University of Hertfordshire over the quality of its franchised operations in Malaysia. </p> <p>A survey by the Committee of Vice-chancellors and Principals has revealed that universities are stepping up their international programmes in light of the prime minister's initiative. The priority countries for many institutions are China, India, Malaysia and Japan.</p>",
  "More than 82 years after the Bolsheviks murdered the last Russian tsar with a bullet in the head, Nicholas II was canonised last night by the Russian Orthodox church. <p>Making a saint of the autocrat whose 21 years of misrule spanned two lost wars and two revolutionary uprisings, and contributed hugely to the victory of communism in 1917, is controversial and divisive. </p> <p>Nicholas, his wife Alexandra, and their five children were killed in July 1918 in the basement of a house in the Urals city of Yekaterinburg, Boris Yeltsin's power base. All seven were proclaimed Orthodox martyrs and saints at the assembly of bishops' millennium meeting in the newly restored Christ the Saviour Cathedral near the Kremlin in Moscow. </p> <p>Another 1,100 Christians persecuted during 70 years of communist rule became saints, making this by far the biggest mass canonisation ever held. The nearest equivalent was in the mid-16th century when 39 Orthodox saints were canonised in a single session. </p> <p>Nicholas is as much reviled in Russia as he is revered by the Orthodox faithful, and the arguments over whether he should be canonised have been raging for years. </p> <p>Highlighting the delicacy of the issue the head of the church, Patriarch Alexei, told the assembly that the canonisation could cause a split. </p> <p>\"There are different opinions in the church as to whether to attach the tsar's family to the assembly of saints,\" he conceded. The debate had to be especially thorough, \"so that making a decision will not cause dangerous schisms in our community\". </p> <p>In canonising the imperial family, the church hierarchy was anxious to stress that it was not endorsing Nicholas's record as tsar or making a political judgment, though that argument was dismissed as nonsensical by critics. </p> <p>\"In the last Russian Orthodox monarch and his family, we see people who sincerely tried to carry out the commandments of the gospels,\" said the proclamation, which was agreed unanimously. </p> <p>\"The light of all-conquering Christian faith was seen in the suffering the royal family endured during their incarceration with gentleness, patience, and humility, and in their martyr deaths.\" </p> <p>Nicholas, Alexandra and the children, Alexei, Olga, Tatiana, Maria and Anastasia, were canonised as \"passion-bearers\", the lowest category of Orthodox sainthood, because of the humility and forbearance they showed in accepting their deaths at the hands of 11 Bolshevik gunmen in the early hours of July 17 1918. </p> <p>\"What! What!\" were said to be the tsar's final words on being told by Yakov Yurovski, the local Bolshevik secret policeman who led the firing squad, that he was to be shot. </p> <p>The seven Romanovs and four servants were shot at point-blank range, ushering in the Red Terror. The sole survivor was Joy, the imperial spaniel. </p> <p>\"Nine out of 10 of the virulent advocates of canonisation are people who are convinced that Nicholas II was ritually killed by Jews as part of a global conspiracy,\" commented a church analyst, Alexander Morozov. </p> <p>The Moscow theology professor Alexei Osipov said there were absolutely no grounds for canonising the Romanovs, particularly as, unlike the thousands of religious victims of communist persecution, they did not die for their faith. \"[Nicholas] suffered not for his Christian convictions but as a political figure,\" he said. </p> <p>Sainthood requires evidence of miracle-working. As recently as three years ago the head of the church canonisation commission, Metropolitan Yuvenali, ruled out sainthood for the tsar on the grounds that there was no such evidence.</p>",
  "The message is definitive: it covers a wall. \"Goodbye Mr President. Farewell to the Commander-in-Chief\". But a Proustian ambivalence haunts the marbled corridors of the mausoleum. We've come not to salute William Jefferson Clinton as his moment dies - but, in search of times past and future, to visit Richard Milhous Nixon at his final resting place amid the palm trees of suburban Los Angeles. <p>Wallowing in LA money, soft and hard, these past few days, President Bill has raised $40m for would-be President Al - but also $10m or so towards the Clinton memorial library. Presidencies, as they pass, are entombed like pharaohs in the burial chambers of artefacts, papers and slavish tribute. When power ends, so the Little Rock temple of pyramid selling - all $120m of it - must rise. What will it be like, this Clinton edifice? Consider the Nixon reality of Yorba Linda: a stretch of colonnades and vibrant flowers, a hushed entrance hall, servile flunkeys - and the first exhibition hall. \"Two American icons - the First Lady and Barbie together\". Yes, here are all the Presidents' wives of history wearing their inauguration dresses as Barbie dolls. Do you like Barbie Bush in pearls and blue velvet? Or Barbie Hillary in turquoise, blonde hair piled like an ice cream cone? I cherish Barbie Mamie Eisenhower in truly shocking pink. How did you enjoy the show, Mrs Lincoln? </p> <p>So to the memorabilia. Some is standard. The poster that reads \"Ike and Dick, Sure to Click\". The sanitised story of Alger Hiss. A TV rerun of the Kennedy debates which somehow doesn't let JFK get a word in. Bulbous yellow campaign Chevrolets and tank-like presidential Cadillacs. Yet we're only warming up. In a vaulted room, life-size statues of history's greats consort. Mao, de Gaulle, Kruschev, Churchill - and Dicky. (Whatever happened to Mrs T? Or, indeed, Spiro Agnew?) \"Please\", it says round the corner, \"Do Not Touch the Berlin Wall\". And there's an eight-foot lump of concrete covered in joyful graffiti as though our hero - out of time - had borne it back from the east in person. Next door the \"gifts of the people\" sit in sombre cabinets. A wooden clockwork elephant - \"donor anonymous\". Hand-knitted portraits of Nixon's dogs. A Colt 45 semi-automatic presented by a Mr Elvis Presley of Memphis, Tennessee. </p> <p>Beyond, a long, dark tunnel tells the \"story\" of Watergate, mostly concentrating on those who spoke out for truth and justice. \"I'll be damned if we're going to let this ugliness obscure the positive record of the President\" (George Bush, 1973). Then, suddenly, the great dissembler lives. \"Ask President Nixon a question\" by pressing computer screens and a video in a little chapel of resurrection brings you his answer. \"Did you ever feel unfairly treated by the press?\" \"Is it true that you only ate Milky Way for breakfast?\" \"What was your greatest poker hand?\" And the oracle of Yorba Linda responds at length. \"There will be a 17-minute time delay on your question\" the computer reports. Bizarre!</p> <p> Outside, on a lushly watered, grassy plot, Richard and Patricia Nixon lie side by side. Inside the justifications never end. Far outside, the Republican party - pledging to restore \"dignity and honour\" to the Oval Office - continues on its pious way. Do you feel under-appreciated Mr President? Answer in 36 minutes. Will it be like this, too, in Little Rock? The Paula Jones room with muzak from Gennifer Flowers, the Monica salon where the oracle Bill repeats that he never had sex with that woman, not ever, and broods through eternity on the meaning of \"is\"? Will his party, too, turn its back in forgetfulness once the final orations, the testaments to prosperity and 22m new jobs, have faded? Probably. </p> <p>History is a half-eaten hamburger at Camp David. Kitsch comes naturally in the valley of the pharaohs. But, for the moment, watching him joshing, grinning, raising the spirits and the boodle, it's hard to believe. After 1960, Richard Nixon wrote: \"The campaign had an intensity of spirit at once exhausting and uplifting.\" Campaigns are Clinton's adrenalin, his life. And now, in life, there is death. </p>",
  "Four British soldiers were injured in violent clashes in the Kosovan town of Mitrovice yesterday, as the UN launched an operation to reassert its authority in the province. <p>Three soldiers from the 2nd Battalion, Royal Fusiliers, suffered head injuries and were taken back to their base in Pristina. Another suffered a hand injury. Six Serbs were also injured in the clashes outside a factory complex in the predominantly Serbnorth of the town. </p> <p>The operation saw 900 troops from Britain, Denmark and France take control of the lead smelting plant which the UN said was polluting the local environment. </p> <p>The violence erupted as workers arriving to start their shifts at the Serb-run complex gathered outside an entrance. British troops manning checkpoints nearby were attacked by up to 500 people angry at the operation. </p> <p>Rubber bullets were fired and the crowd was charged by the Fusiliers with batons as the soldiers came under a hail of stones. The British troops were ultimately ordered to withdraw and were replaced by French troops. </p> <p>It is only the second time this year that British soldiers have been deployed in Mitrovice. A spokesman for the French army, Henry Aussavy, put the violence down to local hostility. \"It seems that the Serbs do not like the English,\" he said. Britain is hated for its prominent role in Nato's bombing of Kosovo last year. </p> <p>UN officials said that the takeover was prompted by an increase in lead emissions from the factory, which began to work full-time in June. They that said that air samples indicated pollution levels 200 times above World Health Organisation standards. </p> <p>But the American UN administrator of Mitrovice, William L Nash, said that the takeover was part of a much broader security operation. He admitted that the UN was going to change the structure of local municipal boards in the region over the next few days. </p> <p>Sources inside the UN said that members of Slobodan Milosevic's ruling Serbian Socialist party (SPS) were expected to be removed from their posts. Local Serb leaders have accused the party of attempting to undermine their authority in the region. </p> <p>Mr Nash said that the UN wanted to see a change in the political balance of local authorities. \"We are quite anxious to deal with those people who are interested in democracy, and those that are not interested in democracy can go elsewhere. They can leave Kosovo in a variety of ways.\" </p> <p>Doctors from the local hospital in northern Mitrovice dismissed claims that the smelter was causing pollution. Doctor Radosav Jankovic said: \"We haven't had a patient with a toxicology problem for years. Today only soldiers and Unmik [UN Mission in Kosovo] police officers suffer problems of lead in the blood.\" </p> <p>The head of the UN mission in Kosovo, Bernard Kouchner, denied those claims, saying that at least 160 cases of lead poisoning were being reported a year. He also confirmed that an international consortium had been appointed to run the plant and that the UN had promised workers an advance of 50 deutschmarks (\u00a315.40) on their wages. A $16m (\u00a310.7m) investment package was also announced, funded by Britain, France, Spain, Germany, and the EU. Money is to be spent on a full-scale refurbishment of the plant. </p> <p>Local leaders have voiced concerns that workers may have to be laid off and part of the factory closed. This was also denied by Dr Kouchner. </p> <p>\"We have no intention of closing any part of the Trepca mining complex. On the contrary, we're going to make it safe and profitable.\" </p> <p>Outside the factory there was scepticism about the UN's plans. \"We don't know if they're just going to pay us once and then get rid of us,\" one woman said. </p> <p>At the same time as the operation to close the factory went ahead, a Jordanian special police unit working with the UN closed down a local radio station which had been ordered off the air on Saturday night. </p> <p>A spokesman for the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, responsible for media regulation in Kosovo, said that Radio S had failed to apply for a broadcasting licence. The station's director is also a member of the SPS.</p>",
  "<p>The seminal 19th-century debate between the evolutionists and those who believed in divine intervention has many parallels in today's debates. Science and anti-science lobbies recently collided in the controversy over genetically modified food although no one was quite as anti-science as the then Bishop of Oxford, Samuel Wilberforce, who led the attack on Darwin in the 19th-century debate on evolution. To this day, anti-evolutionist opinions hold sway in parts of the United States. There as here, then as now, \"unnatural\" is often raised as a reason for not proceeding with new science or technology. </p> <p>No one should expect new technologies to be introduced without a wide-ranging public debate in or outside the media. The public will not be duped by technological language or arrogance based on being told what is best for them. They have a right to know the benefits or otherwise of new developments, be they telecommunication masts, mobile phones, genetically engineered food or new medical applications. </p> <p>Indeed the government has, in the last three years, moved significantly towards setting up inquiries, commissions and reports to assess the science behind new developments and to pronounce on such issues, as well as to consider the precautionary principle as a mechanism for deciding to ban something or to allow it to operate within certain restrictions. </p> <p>Different governments often interpret this science in different ways. Science should not be the final arbiter but it ought to give honest appraisal - to say what we know, what we do not know and how we should interpret current scientific knowledge. </p> <p>And so it is with therapeutic cloning, the latest development that threatens to provoke these arguments once more and perhaps with as much intensity as the genetic modification debate. </p> <p>Stem cells are often categorised according to the extent to which they are differentiated or, in other words, committed to develop into a particular cellular type (for example, blood cell, brain cell, liver cell). As a general rule, the earlier the stage of development of the tissues from which the stem cell is taken, the greater the range of cell types it can give rise to. </p> <p>Embryonic stem cells, also called pluripotent, have the capability to turn into all of the cell types found in an adult animal. More highly differentiated stem cells, also called multipotent cells, may be derived from foetuses and adult tissues, although their capacity to produce different cell types is more limited than pluripotent cells. </p> <p>Stem cells derived from early human embryos may, as has been shown in animal experiments, be induced to develop into more specialised cells making up organs and tissues like liver and kidneys, or even brain tissue. Embryos and foetuses are commonly used in mice and it is claimed that cells from human embryos and foetal tissue can be cultured in the laboratory as stable cell cultures. As tissues develop, some retain stem cells (such as skin, intestine and blood) while other lose these capabilities (such as heart tissue). </p> <p>The term therapeutic cloning is confusing since it is associated with reproductive cloning. A term more favoured by scientists is \"directed cell culture\" or \"specialised cell culture\". The process involves the potential, for example, of injecting heart cells generated in the laboratory to repair heart damage in the individual. Degenerative diseases like Parkinson's, cystic fibrosis, hepatitis, diabetes, leukaemia and other blood disorders have great potential for stem cell therapy. At the same time there is the possibility of treating burns and fractures. We have still to carry out much research to develop the process from stem cell to tissue. </p> <p>Rejection of tissue is another problem yet to be fully explored. Here a nucleus taken from the potential host is introduced into a human egg cell, previously emptied of all its nuclear content, and grown in a uterus. This reproductive cloning technique produced Dolly the sheep. However, therapeutic cloning prevents implantation into the uterus and the egg is allowed to develop to a stage where embryonic cells are produced. Such cells (less than 14 days old) could be reimplanted after growth in vitro into the nuclear parental donor without fear of rejection. No one has argued for reproductive cloning. </p> <p>Here then is a technique with a great potential for human medicine over the next two decades. So why the objections? Why is the anti-abortion pressure group Life suspicious? </p> <p> Part of the suspicion stems from the argument of when does life begin. Life scientists argue it is a continuum - eggs and sperm are alive, fertilised eggs die or are destroyed by nature, and the embryo has only potential for human life. Research on tissue derived from human embryos is regulated under the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority. This act allows the licensing of certain types of research involving human embryos up to the 14th day of development. At present, the act only allows the licensing of such research for specific purposes concerned mainly with studies on infertility, miscarriage and congenital disease. </p> <p>The opposition to this new technology stated \"the traditional belief that life is a gift from God to be treated with reverence and accorded profound and deep respect\" (Lord Alton MP, parliamentary and scientific committee meeting, December 1999). This, they say, contrasts with treating embryos as a means to an end. </p> <p>The questions posed are: is the deliberate creation of a human embryo for use in therapies permissible? Is it necessary? Are there alternatives - using stem cells from the patient's own body, for example? Can we learn from other sources than humans? Can any benefits outweigh the dangers posed by manipulation of the human species? </p> <p>There is clearly a debate to be had to identify ethical considerations and to make choices clear. The battle lines are drawn and tempers look like getting frayed. </p> <p>It does not seem too far from biological explanations of evolutionary process opposed by more religious ideology. Tampering with nature is an anathema to many but the history of scientific progress shows we do gain from scientific knowledge, but it must be divulged in an open participative society which is not centred in just one or two nations. </p> <p>This is a global debate, which is necessary to ensure benefits extend across the planet on an equal basis, and that multinational corporations do not engineer the debate to reap financial profits. We must find time in parliament to debate the issues openly and thoroughly. </p> <p> Dr Ian Gibson, MP for Norwich North, is chairman of the parliamentary office of science and technology, chairman of the parliamentary and scientific committee and a member of the House of Commons science and technology select committee. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p><strong> Vodafone</strong> yesterday saw its improving prospects in the German UMTS mobile phone licence battle feed through to its shares, which added almost all of the 17 points provided by the telecom stocks on the FTSE. </p> <p>According to analysts a reasonable price for the licences was in prospect after a rival German bidder pulled out. Vodafone closed at 276.5p, or 6.5p higher. </p> <p> <strong> Colt Telecom</strong> shot up 55p to \u00a319.35, helped by a Sunday newspaper tip that the firm's recent falls looked overdone. </p> <p>Telecoms joined with pharmaceuticals to boost the FTSE 100, but despite a vigorous start the main market slipped back from its early highs.

Analysts suggested this sector, which is fundamentally strong, was still springing back from last week's dip, prompted by a patent setback for a US drugs firm. </p> <p>However, not all branches of pharmaceuticals were up yesterday. <strong> PPL Therapeutics</strong> fell 10%, shaving about \u00a310m off the company's market value. </p> <p>The drop occurred after reports that the Roslin Institute, which cloned Dolly the sheep with PPL, will stop researching the use of pigs for human transplants due to concerns that it may pass diseases to humans. </p> <p>PPL has had a bad time recently. Unsuccessful talks with potential partners for AAT, a treatment for cystic fibrosis, have been followed by analysts stating the company needs to raise more money. </p> <p> <strong> Bioglan Pharma</strong> also dropped almost 4% yesterday. Analysts said that it was due to reports that the company was in the market to acquire parts of the Glaxo dermatological business. </p> <p> <strong> WPP's</strong> company report saw its share price go up to 930p, driven by its first-half profits, which were up nearly 24%, beating analysts expectations. </p> <p>The company is due to merge with US advertising firm Young &amp; Rubicam, adding to its holdings of J Walter Thompson and Ogilvy &amp; Mather, transforming it into the world's largest advertising organisation. </p> <p>Chief executive officer, Sir Martin Sorrell, cited strong revenue growth across their global operations. </p> <p>The group predicted a buoyant second half boosted by the Olympics and US elections. </p> <p>There has been strong growth in advertising revenues in the past year due to millennium celebrations, dot.com advertising and favourable economic conditions. </p> <p>However, WPPs' closing price was 907p, down 1p. </p> <p>Former shell firm <strong> Rodime</strong> surged 35% yesterday at the end of almost two months of suspension. </p> <p>Rodime has now acquired Littlewoods football pools and gaming arm. </p> <p>The company, owned by Trevor Hemmings, said underlying growth was exceeding internal forecasts. </p> <p>The firm's shares were 6p higher to 23p. </p> <p> <strong> Reuters</strong> saw its stock rise 19p to \u00a312.78, following reports that 1,700 jobs could be cut as part of a two year restructuring plan to improve margins. </p> <p>Oil and gas firms countered telecoms and drug firms, wiping 15 points off the FTSE 100. <strong> Shell</strong> fell 7.5p to 558.5p and <strong> BP</strong> went down 12p to 589p. </p> <p>Analysts believed the falls were more about profit taking following a strong performance last week than any change in the sector's fundamentals. </p> <p>Summing up the markets, one analyst concluded: \"Investors are looking a little more constructive at the moment but there is still no tremendous risk appetite. </p> <p>\"There is not a lot of investment going on, something exacerbated by the summer holidays.\"</p>",
  "If this were not a deadly serious, indeed a seriously deadly issue, the Ministry of Defence's latest statements over Britain's bombing performance during the Kosovo war would be worthy of a Yes, Minister script. We now know from the leak of a confidential Whitehall report that, far from scoring a resounding success, the RAF's \"dumb\" bombs hit their targets only 2% of the time. The guided bombs were better but, overall, the RAF had a worse performance than in Bosnia or Iraq. Faced with this embarrassing disclosure, the MoD now says its earlier statement that the Kosovo campaign was the \"most accurate ever conducted\" was \"relative\". The boast was true \"relative to the operational environment\" - ie taking account of the facts that the weather over Kosovo was cloudy much of the time, the RAF had run out of \"smart bombs\", and pilots were told to fly so high that they could not easily see what they were trying to hit. In other words, the RAF won the race relative to the fact that all the other runners got to the finishing line before it. <p>The MoD's nonsense is not unique. The US secretary of defense, William Cohen, claimed last September that \"of the thousands of bombs that were dropped and the missiles that were fired, nearly all of them hit the intended target\". Presumably, it all depends what you mean by a \"target\". If it is a general target zone with a centre and an enormous circumference, perhaps you can justify that comment. General Wesley Clark, commander of Nato forces during the Yugoslav campaign, tried a different tack. He purred last October: \"I just want to emphasise the incredible precision of the bombing: the fact that on 78 days with over 23,000 weapons dropped or fired, there were only 20 incidents of collateral damage.\" Decoded, that means Nato was extremely lucky. The bombs mostly failed to hit anything military. Fortunately, they also missed civilians - at least some of the time. The independent agency, Human Rights Watch, has calculated that Nato bombs killed about 200 people in Serbia and 300 (mostly Albanians) in Kosovo. The killing has not yet stopped, as unsuspecting people unexpectedly trigger hidden cluster bombs. </p> <p>The human damage apart, the worst aspect of the newly revealed inaccuracy is the way the government hushed it up. Perhaps because it took place in Europe, but certainly because it was Nato's first shooting war, public opinion throughout the alliance's member nations was engaged as never before. The propaganda battle was vital. But it is now clear that the authorities deceived the public about the effectiveness of the air strikes, not only while the conflict was under way, but even after it ended. The leaked report about inaccuracies was given to a closed conference of defence analysts in February, a day after the same officials who heard it had been sitting with journalists for a much more triumphant public presentation. This was classic Whitehall whitewash - one story for the public, the truth for the experts. When the magazine Flight International bravely prepared to reveal this, it was served with a D notice. </p> <p>Nato prides itself on being an alliance of democracies, but the Kosovo war showed a disturbing lack of public accountability. The overwhelming message which emerges from this latest \"lesson from Kosovo\" is that an independent inquiry into Nato's targeting policy is needed. Parliamentary select committees have already looked at many aspects of the war, but yesterday's revelations hint at further crucial answers still waiting to be given.</p>",
  "<p>Applications are sought from scientists wanting to spend five years as a close adviser to the prime minister.</p> <p>Job requirements include having to appear on the Today programme at a moment's notice to stand up for the government or the scientific community and calm the nation down over any topic - from gaping ozone holes to genetically modified foods - when all other senior academics and officials appear to be suddenly unavailable for comment.</p> <p>The candidate must also be prepared to be grilled by the Treasury spending committee during Whitehall spending reviews - the equivalent of being interviewed by several John Humprhys at once. Salary: at least \u00a3115,000 a year.</p> <p>Not quite the job advert that was rushed out by senior mandarins at the Department of Trade and Industry a couple of months ago, when one official realised that Sir Robert May's term as the government's chief scientific adviser was fast coming to an end - but perhaps a more realistic synopsis of what will be expected of the new chief scientific adviser working in the modern era of the government's increasingly involved and intense relationship with the scientific world.</p> <p>Interviews have been completed, and an announcement is expected any day now of the scientific expert who faces the daunting task of following in the footsteps of Sir Bob. During the last five years, May has successfully managed one of the most pressurised posts in the country - perhaps only less pressurised than the England football coach or the prime ministership itself.</p> <p>May will now serve until the end of September, even though his contract officially terminates this month. It is now unthinkable for the government to be without its adviser ready to dissipate the next scientific crisis and placate the public and press.</p> <p>Among the usual suspects being bandied around as potential successors are Sir Tom Blundell, former chief of the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, Dr Paul Nurse, director of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund, Professor George Radda, head of the Medical Research Council, Sir Martin Rees, Astronomer Royal, and even Susan Greenfield, the Oxford University neurobiologist, friend of the Blairs and science populariser.</p> <p>A government official with a mischievous sense of humour told one particularly naive journalist that Carol Vorderman was in line for the position. But we can confirm that there is nothing in this scurrilous rumour: Carol is not about to hang up her Countdown boots just yet.</p> <p>So what will the major challenge be for his successor? May quips, \"Following me.\" It is a typical Mayism: arrogant in the extreme, but not without a hint of truth to it.</p> <p>\"The problem with Bob is that he thinks he is five times cleverer than anyone else, when in fact he is only two times as clever,\" muses one senior scientist who has experienced May at close hand on the cliquey science and higher education policy-making circuit.</p> <p>May is indeed a hard act to follow - in many ways perfectly suited to the job. The government's scientific adviser must have that unusual combination of both academic ability and political acumen.</p> <p>Whatever their particular expertise, they must also become a true polymath: writing reviews on the complex scientific issues of the day, from human cloning to the safety of mobile phones. They must want to relinquish an established academic life to become the focus of all the country's unease and hostility towards scientific developments and their impact on our lives.</p> <p>\"There are not many people with all those characteristics who government would accept and who would actually want the job,\" says Dr Peter Cotgreave, director of the Save British Science lobby group.</p> <p>May, a straight-talking Australian, whose early scientific career - working out the mathematics of extinction - took off in the States, has been a hit with civil servants, ministers, scientists and journalists alike. In many ways he is the very embodiment of un-Britishness, and yet, through force of intellect and personality, he quickly gained respect among the stiff-upper-lipped mandarins within Whitehall. Anyone who has heard him enthuse about tutorials on scientific issues with Tony Blair and a few advisers from the number 10 policy unit will know just how much he warmed to the role. </p> <p>But it wasn't always like this: when May first took up the post in 1995, many suggested that he didn't have the political nous to prosper in the territorial battles within Whitehall. The scientific adviser has a particularly awkward position within government: acting as civil servant, with all the constraints that entails, on the one hand, but also needing to be, and to be seen as, an independent expert voice.</p> <p>The dual role is symbolised by the two offices May has come to use in the job - one in the Cabinet Office, representing his role as adviser to the prime minister, the other in the Office of Science and Technology, the department of which he is nominally in charge.</p> <p>From this small corner of Whitehall, and without any real financial clout, the adviser tries to influence spending on research and development in all government departments, from defence to the environment to fisheries and food. It is a tough challenge, and May has openly conceded that one of his failures has been to prevent research budget cuts at the Ministry of Defence.</p> <p>Among the three central accomplishments May cites during his time as adviser is his now-renowned statistical analyses of science publications and research spending. These transformed an arcane topic into a widely used source for comparing the research performance of the UK with that of other countries.</p> <p>When evidence-based policy was all the rage within Whitehall, May's conclusions kept re-emerging in ministerial speeches. But most important of all, the studies finally broke the circular discussions over research spending with Treasury officials, who kept coming back to ask for evidence that the money was being well used.</p> <p>The statistics showed that the UK was more cost-effective in its science effort than any other country in the world. May has played his part in the renaissance of science within the heart of government, which has seen it emerge as a priority in the last two spending reviews.</p> <p>Another major success listed by May is the recent government white paper on science and innovation, the seeds of which were planted during May's brief but close relationship with Peter Mandelson, during his short spell as trade and industry secretary. Mandelson, like the chancellor, Gordon Brown, is convinced that the new high-tech businesses are the future powerhouses of the economy.</p> <p>May also mentions the guidelines for scientific advice now used throughout Whitehall, when departments are making important policy and regulatory decisions. The principles have since been taken up by a number of other Western governments.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, the harder times during May's five-year tenure - \"interesting moments when I was on steep learning curves\" - relate to the series of scientific scares that have plagued the government and blackened the image of science among the general public. </p> <p>There have been times when his frankness may have flared, rather than subdued, the flames of controversy. He described Arpad Pusztai's research suggesting that genetically modified potatoes damaged rats as \"garbage\". The leaders of the Soil Association, representing organic farmers, were labelled \"ayatollahs\" after they questioned the safety of GM foods. And he said there was \"not much of a case\" for the government's beef-on-the-bone ban.</p> <p>He has also been on the receiving end of some embarrassing leaks. In a letter to the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, May agreed that ministers should not allow GM crops to be released on to the market before 2003, apparently contradicting the government's policy to refuse demands from environmental pressure groups for a four-year ban.</p> <p>Then there was the scrap with Rosie Boycott, editor of the Daily Express, after he reportedly described science coverage in the Daily Express and Daily Mail as \"crap\".</p> <p>It has been a rocky ride. Yet trawling through press clips of May over the last five years, one gets a clear impression of the high regard in which he is held by journalists. \"Honourable\" and \"admirable\" are just two of the words used to describe him. He is a reporter's dream: plain-talking, accessible, with a great turn of phrase - the very antithesis of what most would envisage from a senior academic or scientist.</p> <p>But May's most lasting impression may well be his contribution to the first tentative steps towards the democratisation of science.</p> <p>Asked whether the government or scientific community could have done anything to prevent the BSE crisis, he has argued that it is difficult to identify any major mistakes: ministers and advisers simply acted on the best advice available to them at the time. But if there is a lesson that has been learnt, it is that science does not hold all the answers, he says, and ministers often have to make decisions when confronted with conflicting evidence.</p> <p>This more open and pragmatic approach has been adopted during the recent debates over GM crops. May's latest review concerned the safety of GM foods. It did not conclude that GM foods were safe, but that there was no evidence at all that they were harmful. The report added: \"Nothing can be absolutely certain in a field of rapid scientific and technological development.\"</p> <p>There is also a growing realisation that science must be made more inclusive. May has backed proposals to set up a world body to police and monitor developments in biotechnology that would aim to find \"a consensus among scientists round the world about what is acceptable and what is safe\". This would act like the intergovernmental panel on climate change set up by the United Nations to advise all governments.</p> <p>May often alludes to the surveys that have shattered the myth that the public's distaste of science was predicated on ignorance of the issues. They show in fact that people with greater knowledge of scientific issues are more likely to be resistant to some developments. It is a sobering thought for the largely discredited public understanding of science movement, which was borne of the presumption that scientists had a duty to enlighten the blind plebian masses. Now ministers are talking in terms of SUP - scientists understanding the public.</p> <p>It is a message May will take to the Royal Society when he takes the helm of the world's oldest club of scientists later in the year. It is also perhaps the hardest challenge of all facing the eminent scientist who will take his or her place as the next chief scientific adviser.</p> <p><strong>Well, that's cleared that up, then...</strong></p> <p>\"Don't worry, there won't be a quiz.\" Sir Robert May calming the Queen down before explaining Fermat's Last Theorem. </p> <p>\"Everyone in science knows that what goes on in laboratories makes EastEnders look tame. Presumably producers think they are too worthy to screw around like that.\" Complaining about the coverage of science on television.</p> <p>\"Crap.\" Commenting on the science coverage in the Daily Express and Daily Mail. </p> <p>\"It has nothing to do with biology. The people who run the movement think that if you put what they call natural poisons in the soil, that is OK. Yet some of the stuff they use is really nasty but is deemed OK by the ayatollahs who run the Soil Association and who rule the organic farming movement.\" Criticising the Soil Association, which represents organic farmers and whose patron is the Prince of Wales.</p> <p>\"If you mix cyanide with vermouth in a cocktail and find that it is not good for you, I don't draw sweeping conclusions that you should ban all mixed drinks.\" Attacking the \"flawed\" research showing that genetically modified potato had harmed laboratory rats.</p> <p>\"When I was asked at the ceremony what I was going to do with the money, I told them I was going to buy a flat in Chelsea.\" On receiving the 1996 Crafoord Prize, the equivalent to a Nobel prize.</p> <p>\"When the whole GM foods debate heated up, he [Tony Blair] took the better part of an afternoon to have what was in effect an interactive tutorial and went away and wrote his own newspaper articles as a way of consolidating his grasp. It was very impressive.\" On the Blair science tutorials.</p> <p>\"It is words which Brecht put into the mouth of Galileo. He said that the aim of science is not to open a door to infinite wisdom but to set a limit to infinite error. That is a more poetic way of saying science in my view is more a way of asking questions than it is of giving answers.\" On the unrealistic expectations placed on science.</p>"
