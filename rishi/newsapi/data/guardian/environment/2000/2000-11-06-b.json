  "<p>On the afternoon of Saturday October 13 1945, next to each other in the directors' box at Stamford Bridge, sat the statesmanlike secretary of the Football Association, Stanley Rous, and Comrade Ravenko, the Soviet sports minister's chief emissary, newly flown in from Moscow. They watched Chelsea play West Ham United, and for much of the match the two men (plus two interpreters) were deep in whispered conversation. </p> <p>Only six months had passed since the death of Hitler, five since VE Day, four since the atom bombing of Hiroshima, and three since Clement Attlee's landslide victory over Winston Churchill in the general election. After the match, in the directors' room, Rous and Ravenko shook hands on their deal before chauffeurs drove them separately away through the bombed-out streets of west London. </p> <p>Three weeks later, on Sunday November 4, an aircraft touched down at Croydon airport, a US-built lend-lease Dakota with a scarlet star motif on the tailfin and each wingtip. Rous of the FA and a bemedalled phalanx of uniformed personnel from the Soviet embassy greeted the disembarking passengers in the hut which served as the arrivals' lounge. </p> <p>They comprised 39 men - 20 footballers and 19 trainers, coaches, journalists or general \"minders\" - and one woman, the interpreter Alex Elliseyeva, whom, in no time, Fleet Street was to dub \"Alexandra the Silent\". </p> <p>It was the Moscow Dynamo football team and through that month, 55 Novembers ago, they were to cause a luminous sensation in grey, austere, war-ravaged Britain. </p> <p>Rous at once had to apologise. He said he had personally telephoned more than 100 London hotels and none could (or would) put up the exotic party en bloc. So their first night was spent bleakly at the Coldstream Guards' Wellington barracks in St James's. They threatened to go home. The next night the party was dispersed in twos or threes around any number of dingy west London hotels. Double the complaints. </p> <p>On the third day, a desperate Rous persuaded the Imperial Hotel in Russell Square to lease him whole floor - \"Do Russians need sheets?\" the manager asked him - but accommodation only. All meals (including breakfast) thereafter were taken at the Soviet Embassy in Kensington. </p> <p>First opponents would be Chelsea on Tuesday November 13. At once, for a whopping \u00a314,000, Chelsea signed the demon Everton and England centre-forward Tommy Lawton, which news doubled the frenzy of anticipation in the capital. Five-shilling tickets (25p today) were already being offered by London spivs for more than \u00a35, which was then the average weekly wage. </p> <p>The Russians said the press could only watch them practise by invitation. Having done so, Fleet Street's finest were dismissively unimpressed. Paul Irwin in the Sunday Express found the Dynamo players \"completely ordinary ... all their work is done standing still. Do not expect much from this bunch of factory workers, Tommy [Lawton] will bag a hatful.\" </p> <p>In the People, Tom Morgan concurred: \"Chelsea will easily uphold the football supremacy of its fatherland with a ringing victory. Dynamos? These pale boys are far too slow for the top drawer.\" </p> <p>Harold Palmer in the Evening Standard predicted that \"Chelsea will sweep them off their feet\", although Stanley Walton in the Sunday Dispatch did warn: \"They all have slightly in-turning toes which, in my youthful days in Scotland, was the hallmark of a useful shot.\" </p> <p>By Tuesday at noon, west London was at a standstill. An hour before the start, the Stamford Bridge gates were closed on an over-capacity crowd of 74,496, but with thousands more breaking through smashed-down gates, it was reckoned next day that the actual attendance was more than 100,000. </p> <p>The Dynamo players warmed up for 15 minutes before kick-off - to the mesmerised delight of the throng that spilled over the greyhound track and right up to the touchlines. No English team had ever \"warmed up\". The Russians then took off their heavy serge \"sweatsuits\" (something else a British crowd had never seen) and to a collective gasp the Dynamo \"strip\" was revealed - dark blue shirts decorated with a pink letter \"D\" at the breast, long powder blue shorts hemmed with white, and emerald-green stockings with white turnovers. </p> <p>Immediately before kick-off, each Russian presented a bouquet of flowers to his opponent. The Chelsea players did not know where to look; the vast crowd fell silent at such a uniquely titillating wonder on an English football field. And it remained dumbfounded once the contest began as the Russians' inch-perfect passes, positional switches and fluent speed made monkeys of the back-pedalling English players. The chivalrous Lawton said afterwards: \"It was brilliant teamwork, speed and ball control. To be honest, the Russians should have been four goals ahead after only 20 minutes except for their poor shooting.\" </p> <p>It ended 3-3. The following Saturday, Dynamo annihilated Cardiff City by 10-0 at Ninian Park (40,000) - \"This is an awesome, greased machine, not a football team,\" said the Cardiff manager Cyril Spiers. On Wednesday, Dynamo beat Arsenal (who had hastily recruited Stanley Matthews) by 4-3 in obliterating fog at Highbury (54,600), and a week later drew 2-2 with Rangers at Ibrox (90,000). </p> <p>They returned to London for shopping, a banquet with the Lord Mayor, and a visit to Karl Marx's grave at Highgate - and left, in a scarlet-starred Dakota from Northolt airport, as surreptitiously as they had come, leaving a bereft Aston Villa with 70,000 printed but unused tickets for a farewell match the Birmingham club mistakenly thought it had arranged. </p> <p>On Sunday December 2, in his column in the Graphic, Stanley Matthews wrote of \"the finest team ever to visit these islands - we have certainly learned a thing or two from these Dynamos\". </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

  "<p>Towards the end of his playing days Peter Taylor had a loan spell with Joe Royle's workmanlike Oldham side so it must have been that much sweeter for the Leicester manager to take three points from his old boss after what has been a difficult week at the coal-face. </p> <p>Wearing two hats cannot be easy for England's caretaker manager, particularly after seeing Leicester's defence of the Worthington Cup undermined by Crystal Palace in midweek. But after his team responded with this win, which took them up to third place, Taylor took the opportunity to play down the demands of his dual role. He did it as comfortably as his defence coped with City's redundant attack. </p> <p>\"It's been very easy; I have not thought about England at all,\" he said. \"But after what some of the papers had to say on Friday, I'm sure you can appreciate I would rather talk about Leicester City.\" Taylor is angry at reports suggesting that he had been discourteous to England's manager-elect Sven-Goran Eriksson, from whom, he added, he is expecting to hear in the near future. </p> <p>The match was a tedious spectacle, as Royle opted to match Leicester's five-man midfield with one of his own. It would have needed something special to beat a team who have conceded only one goal on their travels, but City were not equipped for inspiration. Instead Robbie Savage settled it with a left-foot shot from the edge of the area after his first effort was blocked. \"Robbie's a lot more skilful than I thought he was before I came here,\" Taylor said. </p> <p>Only then did Royle introduce his most creative players, Ian Bishop and Mark Kennedy, and they soon offered more scope for their team-mates. Though Dickov, who had a low shot well saved by Tim Flowers in the first half, had a couple of half-chances, it was Paulo Wanchope who came closest, but his effort was turned over by the substitute Simon Royce. </p> <p>Leicester would have added to their 10 league goals if Arnar Gunnlaugsson had taken a late opportunity as Royle's side pushed forward for an equaliser, but he was stopped in his tracks by a superb tackle from Steve Howey, who if Taylor's mind wanders may just earn an England recall this week. </p> <p>Flowers, who must be hopeful of a call-up too, was withdrawn at half-time with a \"stiff back\" that required manipulation during the game while Nicky Weaver barely distinguished himself at the other end, and was particularly lucky to get away with handling outside his area. </p> <p>\"Of all our defeats so far that was the least disappointing,\" opined Royle, who is actively looking for a striker. \"They didn't cause us problems in open play but I can see how they keep clean sheets. We've got to find that balance.\" </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

  "<p>America hates a loser, and should Al Gore squander Bill Clinton's golden economic legacy by losing to George W Bush tomorrow he will go down in history as one of the losers of all time. </p> <p>Unemployment is low, inflation is low, real incomes are rising, the dollar is strong, Silicon Valley has transformed the global industrial landscape. Put simply, Gore should be cruising it. Should the Republicans win back the White House after eight years, the pundits will say the vice-president was wooden, lacked warmth, told little white lies, came across like an arrogant know-all - all of which is true. Maybe they will even think up a new catchphrase - \"It's not the economy, stupid\". </p> <p>The economy is not working in Gore's favour. That may be because after such a prolonged period of growth, voters take the good times for granted. Alternatively, they may think the credit for the longest economic expansion in the US since records began has rather more to do with the policies of Al Greenspan than those of Al Gore. Finally, it may be that life under the Democrats these past eight years has not been quite the stroll in the Elysian Fields for ordinary working class Americans that commentators assume. </p> <p>A recent analysis of Clinton administration's record by the American economist Robert Pollin in the New Left Review concluded that it had \"done virtually nothing to advance the interests of organised labour or working people more generally\". To be sure, the minimum wage has been raised, but its purchasing power has fallen by 40% since the late 60s. To be sure, real wages have been rising for the last couple of years, but this follows a period of falling wages stretching back two decades. Wage inequality has widened, with the gains for ordinary workers far lower than in previous economic expansions. If Gore needs to know why he is having trouble getting his core vote out, he should mull over the fact that average wages for non-supervisory workers are lower than they were under Ronald Reagan. </p> <p>Gore may still win. When it comes to it, there may be a temptation to hold on to nurse for fear of something worse. However, there does not seem to be too much fear about and Bush could find himself in the same position as Tony Blair in 1997 - about to inherit an economy that has been growing for nine years without a break - the longest expansion since records began in the 1850s. Almost without exception, the gurus of Wall Street believe that the US economy is heading for a soft landing and, with the budget in surplus, Bush can afford to get straight down to doing what Republican presidents enjoy most - cutting taxes for the rich. </p> <p>But it is far to early to conclude that there will be a soft landing. Neither Bush nor Gore has dared to mention the fact that America's boom could come crashing down at any moment, even though they must be aware of the risks. </p> <p>On the web, there is a wonderful site called iTulip.com, which specialises in warning stupid and greedy investors of the dangers ahead. It argues that there will be a point at which even the most stubborn bull of Wall Street realises that the game is up and starts to yell at his broker: \"Stop arguing with me! Sell, you bastard.\" This, charmingly, is known as the puke point, and when enough investors reach the PP at the same time panic sets in; iTulip believes this could be November, other analysts think it could be January. </p> <p>There is little doubt that the US has witnessed an industrial renaissance over the past decade and a half. In part this has been due to the remarkable vigour and innovative zeal of Americans themselves, but it has also been due to the pump priming provided by massive defence spending in the 80s, the weakness of the dollar until the mid-90s and the squeeze on wages. The beneficiaries of the pay cuts imposed on workers have been the profits of corporations and the pay packets of better-off; this transfer of resources has been recycled into higher investment and the stock-market boom. </p> <p>So we have had a situation where there has been no shortage of cash to fund new ventures, even those with little chance of commercial success, and no shortage of money to drive shares in these companies to unprecedented levels. Although the pace of expansion under Clinton has been unremarkable when set against those of the 50s and 60s, stock market valuations went crazy. To take one example, the price-earnings ratio for Xerox peaked at 123 in 1961; the peak for the online auction company eBay was 9,571. </p> <p><strong> Wealth effect</strong><br> </p> <p>In the next phase of the cycle, the boom in the stock market created a wealth effect, which in turn fuelled increases in consumption and gave individuals the confidence to take on more debt and companies the confidence to invest in even more marginal projects. Investors in other parts of the world looked on enviously as Wall Street reached dizzy heights. Desperate for a slice of the action, they bought US assets at overblown prices, driving up the value of the dollar and helping to dampen down American inflation. </p> <p>That this position is precarious in the extreme should be immediately apparent. Financing consumption via stock market gains only holds good while the stock market is going up, and Wall Street has moved sideways this year. Why has it moved sideways? Simple. There has been colossal overinvestment, profits are starting to come under pressure, and the cannier investors are starting to lose their faith in the ability of the hi-technology sector to deliver the earnings that would justify their absurd share prices. Actually, the really canny investors banked their winnings a long time ago. </p> <p>As Graham Turner, of GFC Economics, points out, there are plenty of signs that the economy is slowing. Manufacturing production is slipping back, consumer spending on durable goods and cars has turned down sharply during 2000 and the labour market has started to turn down. With demand slackening but capacity over-abundant, the inevitable is happening. Investment is being cut back and prices are falling. The price of phone calls is falling by 6% a year, with long distance calls falling at an annualised rate of 14.5% in the past six months. This is not good news for AT&amp;T. </p> <p>Yet even now there is a sense of denial - and this could prove costly. Share prices have perked up, belying what is going on in the corporate bond market , where rising yields indicate that a credit squeeze is well under way. If there is borrowing going on at the moment, it is probably distress borrowing. </p> <p>All of which suggests that a hard landing is a much more plausible scenario than the many followers of Dr Pangloss would have us believe. Early cuts in interest rates might just do the trick, but having underwritten the stupidity of investors once, Greenspan will be reluctant to do the same a second time. The economists at Goldman Sachs believe that rates will be kept on hold for the whole of next year, and if they are right the consequence may be a very sharp slowdown indeed, with a plunge in the dollar acting as a further deterrent to easing monetary policy. </p> <p>If this happens, it will provide a suitable epitaph to the Clinton years. As Pollin notes: \"The core of Clinton's programme has been global economic integration, with minimum interventions to promote equity in labour markets or stability in financial markets. Gestures to the least well-off have been slight and backhanded, while wages for the majority have either stagnated or declined. Wealth at the top, meanwhile, has exploded. But a stratospheric rise in stock prices and debt-financed consumption spree make a mortgaged legacy. Clinton will hand over to his successor the most precarious financial pyramid of the post-war period.\" It could be a good election to lose. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:Larry.elliott@theguardian.com\">Larry.elliott@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>John Prescott's offer of \u00a351m over four years to prevent the sort of floods seen in the past month is a drop in the ocean of what may be needed, say the environment agency and green organisations. </p> <p>Geoff Spence, head of water management at the environment agency, yesterday welcomed the extra one-off cash payment but said he would be \"amazed\" if a review of Britain's inland flood defences did not reveal the need for far more money to be spent. </p> <p>\"It will certainly be far more than \u00a351m,\" said Mr Spence. The agency argued for \u00a3100m a year in last year's spending review but was given \u00a330m extra, despite conservative estimates from the Department of Environment that global warming would require an extra \u00a34.5bn to be spent on flood defences in the next 50 years. </p> <p>Only \u00a32m (4%) of the new money promised by the government at the weekend can be spent in the next 12 months. Most is expected to go on \"running repairs\" to the failing inland defence systems and to accelerate existing studies of what work needs to be done to protect towns such as Shrewsbury, Bewdley, Lewes, York, Gloucester and Uckfield, which have repeatedly been hit in the past few years. </p> <p>Yesterday, the new money was criticised for being too little too late by green groups and communities affected by some of the worst flooding on record. \"The sums Mr Prescott is talking about are finger-in-the-dyke stuff. We'll never keep climate change at bay by spending a few million. It will cost billions, the problems are that serious,\" said Charles Secrett, director of Friends of the Earth. </p> <p>The priority, said the environment agency, would be to repair defences which have been damaged or destroyed in the past 10 days. The agency will begin a review of inland defences when the floods have gone, but this is not expected to be published until February. </p> <p>One problem the authorities face is that even relatively small new defences can take up to four years to evaluate, design and build. </p> <p>There is no simple way of defending all towns and villages. No one is in favour of building high flood walls around all vulnerable places. Experience abroad has shown that investments of this kind which may involve huge earthworks, raising river banks, building sluices and canalising rivers to divert water, often fail and lead to problems elsewhere. </p> <p>The reality is that if, as expected, climate change kicks in with more frequent extreme weather, government, the business community and individuals, must be prepared to spend billions of extra pounds a year unless far greater emphasis is given to keeping the water on the land, and preventing it from reaching the rivers too quickly. </p> <p>The quandary is that to do anything serious will cost billions, but to do nothing may cost much more. A recent EU report on the adaptions required for climate change in Europe noted the increasing pressure of floods and extreme weather on water resources, agriculture, transport, health, and coastal zones. </p> <p>So far Britain has seen little damage compared to what is forecast to happen. </p> <p>The Association of British Insurers estimates it could cost at least \u00a310bn in insurance losses if the Thames catchment region were massively flooded. A prolonged storm over the upper half of the river Trent and Severn catchments, it said, could cost about \u00a35bn. </p> <p>\"It's vital that flood defences are adequate. It could take very high investment to bring internal defences up to scratch. Coastal defences, too, are inadequate in certain areas,\" said an ABI spokesman yesterday.</p>",
  "<p>The after-effects of torrential rain were today continuing to cause havoc across Britain as police revealed the bad weather death toll has now risen to eight. </p> <p>A tree fell on a car in \"atrocious\" conditions in Herefordshire, killing two passengers and critically injuring the driver. </p> <p>The environment agency increased the number of severe flood warnings from 22 to 28 as people in flood-hit areas began a waiting game to see how last night's rain will make rivers break their banks. </p> <p>Areas still recovering from last week's deluge were swamped once again, and the river Uck at Uckfield in Sussex burst its banks, flooding the town for the second time in three weeks. </p> <p>A West Mercia Police spokesman said the latest deaths happened at about 7.35pm last night on the B4361 at Richards Castle, near Tenbury Wells, when a large tree came down on a Daihatsu Fourtrak. </p> <p>\"Two people were declared dead at the scene. The driver was taken to hospital with head and spinal injuries and is in a critical condition,\" he added. </p> <p>\"The driver took no avoiding action and the tree fell fair and square right on the car. </p> <p>\"The weather conditions were atrocious and very windy. The tree narrowly missed a passenger coach travelling in the opposite direction.\" </p> <p>Post-mortem examinations and formal identification of the two victims were due to be carried out later today. All three people involved are from the Ludlow area. </p> <p>The environment minister, Michael Meacher, told a London news conference that local authorities had taken advice from the environment agency over building in flood plains. He added: \"In the overwhelming majority of cases that advice has been taken.\" </p> <p>Mr Meacher said: \"Whether there should be a veto, to be exercised by the agency is quite another matter. </p> <p>\"After all, local authority planning departments and planning committees are meant to represent the local community. </p> <p>\"They are accountable and I do think it is right that the ultimate responsibility should lie with them.\"</p> <p>A band of heavy rain is now concentrated over the north east and North Yorkshire, said PA WeatherCentre forecaster Paul Knightley. </p> <p>\"We've had the worst of the heavy rain but the system will hang around for a few days, gradually getting more patchy,\" he added. </p> <p>\"But any more rain in areas like North Yorkshire is potentially very bad news.\" </p> <p>Severe flooding is likely to occur in Kent and Sussex as more than 50mm (2 inches) of rain fell in the region during the night and parts of the counties have already flooded. </p> <p>The environment agency reported the heaviest rainfall in Plumpton, East Sussex, where 60mm (about 2.3 ins) fell in 12 hours. </p> <p>In Hampshire, the worst affected area was along the river Meon which burst its banks this morning, flooding the villages of Exton and West Meon. Police said eight houses were under about 3ft of water. </p> <p>About 100 homes have also been evacuated in Dorchester, Dorset, after the environment agency said the river Frome was at its highest ever level. </p> <p>In West Sussex, 100 properties had to be pumped out at Maidenbower by firefighters overnight after the Gatwick Stream overflowed into properties. </p> <p>Rivers across Wales, Yorkshire, Devon and Cornwall were also put on flood watch.</p> <p>Meanwhile, 100 people have been evacuated from the East Yorkshire villages of Snaith and Gowdall, which are both near the River Aire. </p> <p> <strong>Interactive quiz:</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/quiz/questions/0,5961,392399,00.html\">Is this the end of the world?</a></p> <p><strong>Talk about it:</strong><br> <a href=\"http://talk.guardianunlimited.co.uk/WebX?13@@.ee7a578/0\">Is global warming to blame?</a></p> <p><strong>Related stories:</strong> <br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/theissues/article/0,6512,391051,00.html\">Global warming: the Issue explained</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/weather/Story/0,2763,393346,00.html\">6 November, 2000: Storm brings more misery</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/weather/Story/0,2763,393312,00.html\">6 November, 2000: Prescott's \u00a351m to beat floods 'a drop in the ocean'</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/weather/Story/0,2763,393285,00.html\">6 November 2000: The great floods of 1947</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/weather/Story/0,2763,393276,00.html\">6 November, 2000: Leader - Recidivist rivers</a></p> <p><strong>Useful links:</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Weather/\">Today's weather on Guardian Unlimited</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.meto.gov.uk/\">The Met Office</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.eastsussexcc.gov.uk/floods/main.htm\">East Sussex County Council flood pages</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/flood/index.htm\">Environment Agency floodline pages</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.meto.gov.uk/sec3/sec3.html\">UK weather warnings - Met Office</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/weather/Story/0,2763,208326,00.html\">More weather sites</a></p>",
  "<p>Daimler Chrysler has shifted its entire \u00a31.25bn business to Omnicom's BBDO creating the world's biggest single car account.</p> <p> The decision, made late on Friday, ends a fierce two-month battle for the business between the Chicago-based True North and the New York-based BBDO network.</p> <p>David Bell, chairman and chief executive at True North, said: \"We're disappointed that the superior quality of our global work and our experience in integrating business from other agencies for Chrysler Group did not seem to be the critical drivers that we'd anticipated.\" </p> <p>The result marks a serious setback for True North as it sees \u00a397m, or 9% of revenue, and up to 15% of earnings wiped off its business overnight. </p> <p>It also poses a huge threat to True North's independence.

  "<b>\"He hails from Snowy River, up by Kosciusko's side, <br> Where the hills are twice as steep and twice as rough, <br> Where a horse's hoofs strike firelight from the flint stones every stride, <br> The man that holds his own is good enough.\"</b> <p>The iconic Australian ballad, The Man from Snowy River, celebrated the courage of a 19th century horseman who was sent out into the country's rugged Great Dividing Range to round up a group of wild horses.</p> <p>The modern-day man from Snowy River might be a park ranger. But their stock is far from iconic today, after rangers in helicopters shot 617 wild horses in Guy Fawkes national park, 300 miles north of Sydney.</p> <p>The National Parks and Wildlife Service wants to cull another 2,000 wild horses in the Snowy Mountains Kosciusko national park, further south.</p> <p>But New South Wales' environment minister Bob Debus last week ordered the suspension of all culling of feral horses in national parks while an independent review of the practice is conducted.</p> <p>Local people were enraged after discovering badly mutilated carcasses scattered across the park. \"The manner in which these horses were killed was absolutely barbaric. It was damned murder - that's what it was,\" said landowner Greg Everingham.</p> <p>Mr Everingham contacted the RSPCA, which claimed it discovered several bullet-riddled horses had survived the cull to stagger on for another day.</p> <p>Arriving on ships with the first white settlers in 1788, more than 300,000 feral horses now roam Australia.</p> <p>Affectionately called brumbies, after James Brumb - a famous horse breeder who released horses into the wild in 1804 - they are part of the country's landscape and literature, even appearing alongside other Australian icons at the Olympic opening ceremony.</p> <p>Across the arid wastes of the Northern Territory, 130,000 horses are shot each year.</p> <p>Conservationists insist that the feral horses are pests, reaching plague proportions in many areas, where they damage biodiversity, displacing all kinds of native flora and fauna, from gum trees to kangaroos.</p> <p>They also fear that some local farmers are slipping their horses into the national parks, where they can feast on prime, untouched grazing land.</p> <p>\"We're getting falsely sentimental over feral horses while the native wildlife that the parks are established to protect are forgotten about. It's a ridiculous situation,\" said Noel Plumb of the Colong Foundation for Wilderness.</p> <p>\"Horses are very hard hooved whereas Australian native animals have soft pads.</p> <p>\"Many of our soils are poor and easily erodable, so when large mobs of horses move about these landscapes they quickly do a lot of damage,\" Mr Plumb explained.</p> <p>The horses congregate around water, trampling banks, fouling water and damaging aquatic life and the water habitats of unique mammals such as platypuses.</p> <p>The National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) said its first aerial cull was long overdue and had only been made possible after bush fires had cleared out undergrowth, enabling helicopters to track and kill the horses.</p> <p>Conservationists also pointed out that it is during periods where trees and plants sprout back after fires that native plants are most vulnerable to being eaten by the horses.</p> <p>However, the Australian Veterinary Association (AVA) said that aerial culling should only be considered in Australia's dry open plains, where helicopters could easily track and put down injured animals without causing undue suffering.</p> <p>\"The very rugged forest terrain in the Guy Fawkes national park is not suitable for this because of the obvious difficulty in conducting the operation in the most humane manner possible,\" said vice president Dr Garth McGilvray.</p> <p>Animal welfare groups suggest that birth control methods could be a more humane alternative to sharpshooters in helicopters.</p> <p>But this requires horses to be rounded up, which is deemed impractical after 17 attempts to round up wild horses in New South Wales national parks in the last decade only resulted in the culling of around 150 horses.</p> <p>It is also claimed that the slow and expensive mustering of horses is more stressful than aerial culling.</p> <p>AVA president Dr Tony English is leading the inquiry into the culling. It have already condemned the \"lack of concern by the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) for the welfare of the many horses which suffered terribly in this incident\".</p> <p>Conservationists fear that the suspension of culling will give the mobs of horses more time to damage the rugged and yet fragile cliffs and gullies of the Great Dividing Range.</p> <p>While the inquiry talks, the horses roam free.

  "Snowbound hills glistening in the sunshine - the first snow of the winter - greeted me when I opened my bedroom curtains the other morning. Always an exciting sight, the first snows with their promise (even to doddery old-timers like me) of winter adventure. <p>Five miles north-east of my home, but in the clear morning air looking almost within throwing distance, rose the little pointed summit of Whiteside Pike, sharply outlined against the sparkling white of the twin summits of White Howe. This Whiteside Pike - not to be confused with Whiteside near Helvellyn, or the Buttermere Whiteside - is a splendid spiky little hill just to your left as you drive over Shap Fells, beyond Longsleddale. A delectable summit devoid of beer-can rings, litter or scratches on the rocks - nothing but heather, bracken, handholds of Coniston Grit, a few pools, maybe buzzards overhead, and views of unspoiled fell country. And from this first summit you can do the exhilarating 10-mile round of the fells enclosing the remote valley of Bannisdale, perhaps to Grey Crag and back, and never see a soul. </p> <p>Of course this early snow doesn't necessarily suggest a long hard winter; it was quite a plastering but it might have all disappeared by now. True, with global warming we don't get the winters of 30 years ago, with up to four months of skiing in the fells, but there's been more snow on the tops in recent years than even the locals realise. Last winter there was skiing on Raise near Helvellyn for several weekends before the year end, and intermittently for a month or two afterwards. In retrospect a \"good\" winter - for some. </p> <p>\u0095 The Coniston Tigers, published by Sigma Press </p>",
  "<p>The concept of Britain as a nation of shopkeepers is fast coming to an end, with a combination of soaring rents and weak high street demand likely to send many retailers to the wall over the next few years, according to Verdict, the leading retail research group. </p> <p>The outlook for small operators is particularly bleak as bigger rivals merge or are taken over, creating just two or three dominant names in any one sector, and as international players dominate by virtue of their scale and cost efficiencies. </p> <p>In its annual research report forecasting likely changes among retailers through to the middle of the decade, Verdict notes that rents, which have jumped almost 30% over the past five years, are the main culprit. </p> <p>More pain is expected after the recent rate review, leaving some store operators facing increases of up to 50%. </p> <p>\"Combined, they will score a direct and severe hit on the margins and profitability of retail companies,\" Verdict says. \"It is inconceivable that retailers will be able to pass on these cost rises to consumers. The current competitive environment in Britain is keeping prices low and has actually reduced the price of many goods.\" </p> <p>The research group sees a boom in merger and acquisitions and believes areas such as furniture and health and beauty will quickly follow the lead being set by grocery chains and do-it-yourself specialists. But it warns that scale alone \"is not the panacea for retailers\". </p> <p>Verdict says: \"They need to make it work for them by squeezing suppliers, IT costs, supply chain costs and personnel. If retailers can make these elements of their cost base more productive, they will be able to increase volume and protect margins.\" </p> <p>The growth in spending by shoppers is expected to slow from the 24% increase seen between 1995 and 2000 to a more modest 20% over the next five years, with the two largest retail sectors - food and clothing - suffering the worst rates of growth. </p> <p>With consumers deserting retail in favour of spending on holidays, eating out, mobile phones and other leisure spending, Verdict believes retailers will have to make themselves more attractive, \"creating greater experiences, excitement ... retail as theatre or leisure and entertainment.\"</p>",
  "To the Guinness Book of Records: reserve a whole page under hypocrisy. It's for George W Bush and the managers of his bid for the White House. They have run a campaign of character assassination. Knowing that Al Gore has an intimidating grasp of the issues, they have used every trick, every dollar of special interest money, every toady in the press, to smear the vice-president as a liar. The cleverness of that diversionary tactic was that if it worked it would relieve GW of giving proper answers to the questions of substance he finds so bewildering. <p>It worked. </p> <p>Now Bush is revealed as a liar on a serious issue of character. And what happens? The smear artists are shouting \"dirty politics\". </p> <p>Given the anti-Gore bias of the mainstream press, last Thursday night's revelation that Bush was arrested for drunken driving in 1976, when he was 30, may have come too late to affect his lead. The Republican spin machine has also been adept in damage control. Within 24 hours it had almost managed to turn the story into \"who leaked?\" instead of \"why didn't he come clean?' It is true the disclosure came from a Maine Democrat, though not from the Gore campaign. But the point is that it is true, and the real question is the character of the candidate who tried to conceal his past. </p> <p>He did confess to \"mistakes\" of his youth, but he would never be specific - hoping the \"mistakes\" would be thought of as youthful pranks, not serious crime. It is an offence to apply for any federal office without divulging an arrest record. Bush not only went to great lengths to cover up his conviction. He lied about it, too. In a 1998 interview, a Dallas Morning News reporter asked Bush point-blank if he had ever been arrested other than for a 1968 fraternity prank and Bush said flatly: \"No.\" The exchange was not reported at the time; it didn't seem newsworthy. And when Bush was called to jury service in a drunk-driving trial in Texas, he filled out the jury questionnaire, but left blank the yes-no entry asking if he had ever been accused in a civil or criminal case. Then he hastily got himself excused on the basis that he was the governor of the state. </p> <p>Imagine if this had been Al Gore! The Wall Street Journal, the most sedulous of the defamers, would have dispatched ferrets to find out what happened on the other form-filling occasions when \"the liar\" had to yield his record. Now the Journal, you bet, will be part of the great \"Smeargate\" diversion. </p> <p>Bush's handlers are saying, with some success, that his ready admission of the offence, when found out, is another sign of his probity. This sums up their entire campaign, one of breath-taking arrogance wrapped up in feel-good bromides. And they have got away with it. </p> <p>The basic misperception here is to confuse amiability with integrity, marketable charm with ability. The truth, bluntly, is that Bush is an irresponsible know-nothing. His instincts are those of the 1930s isolationist, little America, rather than the America that led the world in the creation of a new liberal world order. If he is president, say goodbye to the nuclear test ban, to action on global warming, to peacemaking interventions. </p> <p>Those of you in sodden Britain who might conclude that global warming, for instance, is a matter of concern should know that Bush, like the Wall Street Journal, regards it as a leftist scare. Asked what he would do, he responds that we need more study before ratifying the Kyoto agreement, putting me in mind of a fire chief who arrives at the blaze to say he will have to study the origins of the fire before trying to put it out. </p> <p> On social security, he has never throughout the entire campaign explained how he can take a trillion dollars and put it into personal accounts for mainly young workers without saying where the money will come from to secure the retirement payments for the rest of the ageing workforce. This weekend, attacking federalism, he did not even seem to realise that social security is a federal programme. Why hasn't the press blown the whistle? The economist Paul Krugman in the New York Times, a rare pundit who bothers to do the sums, writes: \"Really big misstatements, it turns out, cannot be effectively challenged because voters can't believe that a man who seems so likeable would do that sort of thing.\" </p> <p>But he would. The drunken driving arrest is not the only character evidence from Bush's past that has been suppressed or glossed over. On October 2, the Center for Public Integrity in Washington and Bill Muntaglio and Nancy Beiles in Talk magazine revealed that Bush not once but repeatedly missed the legal deadlines for reporting his insider stock trades when he was a director and member of the audit committee of a ropey Texas oil company, Harken Energy. In 1991, three years before he ran for governor, the Wall Street Journal headlined one instance when Bush sold near the top of the market before the stock plunged, pocketing nearly $850,000. He was eight months late in reporting this coup. He claimed he had but that the SEC had \"lost the paperwork\". But neither the Journal, or anyone else, has asked Bush if the SEC \"lost the paperwork\" when he was derelict on three other newly-documented insider trades he did not report in the way required by the anti-corruption laws. </p> <p>The 1991 SEC investigation, criticised for being run by friends of then President Bush, ended inconclusively. Bush, it was said, could not have known of the magnitude of Harken's impending loss when he sold out. But the SEC never interviewed Bush and documents obtained last month under the Freedom of Information Act clearly show that Bush had more knowledge than he admitted. At least twice during the month he cashed out, he received memos showing the company was in financial peril. </p> <p>The man who claims the presidency on the grounds of probity has asserted: \"I believe in individual accountability and individual responsibility.\" But the credulous press and the cerebrally challenged television talk shows have been too busy pillorying Gore to ask Bush to reconcile rhetoric and action. \"I will do everything I can,\" he has said, \"to defend the power of private property and private property rights.\" But he has failed to reconcile that public testament with his enrichment from the seizure of private land for his Texas Rangers baseball stadium. Though then a private citizen, he contrived to use the power of the state to claim eminent domain over 270 acres - most of which was not needed for the stadium. Families who lost their land so that Bush and his partners could profit from the development potential are still mad at him for the land-grab and the ordeal of court hearings they had to initiate before getting a fair price. Maree Fanning, who lost the family horse farm, told a reporter: \"If I saw him today, I'd say 'Bite my ass'.\" </p> <p>Tomorrow too many American voters, deprived of the real story, may kiss it. </p> <p> Harold Evans is the author of The American Century</p>",
  "<p>Leading employers' body the CBI last night came under sustained fire from senior ministers and union leaders for demanding an immediate and lasting ban on further employment rights legislation. </p> <p>On the eve of its national conference in Birmingham, the CBI urged the government to drop plans for paid parental leave and measures to enable women to return to work part-time, claiming that 15 separate employment regulations had cost business \u00a312.3bn since Labour came to power three years ago and stifled industry with red tape. </p> <p>Stephen Byers, the trade and industry secretary, and John Monks, TUC general secretary, accused the CBI of using code for an \"attack on decent standards in the workplace\" in its strictures on regulation, with Mr Byers saying he would make no apology for measures such as the minimum wage. </p> <p>Digby Jones, the CBI director-general, and his deputy, John Cridland, went out of their way to insist they were not criticising new employment rights. \"The government has delivered on its manifesto commitments,\" Mr Jones said. \"We are against all the unnecessary red tape that's been brought in around those rights.\" </p> <p>Mr Cridland added: \"There is mounting frustration within the business community about the uncessary pain that goes with laudable gain, particularly for small firms which lack the personnel resources to deal with it.\" </p> <p>They admitted that the bulk of the \u00a312.3bn costs of implementing new workplace rights was to pay for higher wages and shorter working weeks, which had been absorbed by businesses, rather than the extra bureaucracy involved in administering them which has cost only tens of millions. </p> <p>\"We are not even attacking the necessary administration involved - but simply unnecessary red tape,\" Mr Cridland said, claiming it diverted managers from more important functions. But he and Mr Jones insisted that the government should drop plans for any more rights and resist calls for automatic increases in the minimum wage. </p> <p>Ministers plan to launch a green paper before Christmas on paid parental leave, including measures to enable women to return to work part-time, and insist they have already consulted widely with employers. \"This will be a new phase of consultation and we are already aware of the implications for business, especially small firms,\" insiders said. </p> <p>Mr Byers said: \"If the CBI can identify areas of excessive bureaucracy I would be the first to take action to tackle it. But what I am not prepared to do is deny people decent conditions at work.\" </p> <p>He even held out the prospect of a regulatory reform bill in next month's Queen's speech to ensure that regulation is only introduced when absolutely necessary. </p> <p>DTI figures suggest 3m have gained an entitlement to four weeks' paid holiday for the first time while 1.5m stand to benefit from the minimum wage. The TUC said it cost only 9p a week each to introduce equal rights for part-time employees and 2p a week for parents' time off. </p> <p>Mr Monks said employers gained \u00a323bn a year from unpaid overtime and instead of \"moaning\" about red tape, they should work with government and unions to increase productivity and skills. </p> <p>The CBI's attack on red tape came as part of a wider campaign, including a business election manifesto, for lower taxes and regulation. Mr Jones said the extra \u00a35bn taxes a year imposed on business, if added to, would make Britain less attractive for foreign investors and put British firms off investing in plant and training. </p> <p>He said the regulators of privatised industries such as water and rail were becoming \"omnipotent\" and tending to manage their sectors. </p> <p>They should, he said, be more accountable to boards of advisers - \"a lot more we and far less me.\"</p>",
  "Buried deep in the stack at the Bodleian library in Oxford, from which it is exhumed on average once every 50 years, lies a forgotten early 18th-century book which is both fascinating and disappointing by turns. A rare volume - and deservedly so - Memoirs of the 20th Century: Being Original Letters of State under George VI was the first ever complete work of futurology. <p>Written around 1730 by a clergyman, Samuel Madden, it opens intriguingly enough, with a letter datelined Constantinople, Nov 3 1997, but sadly goes downhill from that point. Madden's 1997 is dominated by a George VI who is a mighty world emperor, but most of the book's 527 turgid pages are mired in contemporary, 18th-century concerns. </p> <p>A couple of ideas suggest, none the less, that Madden really was thinking systematically about the future. He envisages the establishment of public granaries in all villages - pretty radical stuff, really - and even some prototype women's rights legislation. Thirty years later, another, more ambitious forward-looking book appeared, The Reign of George VI, 1900 to 1925, became a bestseller, and futurology was on its way. </p> <p>This George was also a conquering hero, who tames the nations the anonymous author believed would be the miscreants of the early 20th century: France and Russia. The latter, 25,000 of whose troops sack Durham in a war of 1900, is seen as the world's second most powerful nation by this time, with America close behind. Not bad at all as predictions go. </p> <p>The book wasn't all politics, either. It foresaw the legacy of the canal-building boom, which had just begun, and extrapolated that by 1900, a network of waterways would form a superhighway system, with the effect that \"Villages grew into towns and towns became cities\". Substitute trains for barges and you are looking at a decent stab at what today's multinationals call trend forecasting. </p> <p>The Reign of George VI also envisages a king who hates modern architecture so much that he builds a new English capital city, called Stanley, in Rutland, which he fills with neo-classical buildings and surrounds by artificial mountains. Fanciful, perhaps, but strangely reminiscent of our own heir to the throne's ideal village, twee little Poundberry, in Dorset. </p> <p>Futurologists tend not to get a great press. No wonder Samuel Goldwyn was moved to observe, \"Never predict anything - especially the future\", and Arthur C Clarke, whose 2001 has in so many ways failed to materialise, to comment wryly that, \"The future isn't what it used to be.\" </p> <p>Yet it is arguable that we are far too harsh in smug retrospect on those who attempt to peer round chronological corners. Naturally, when we try to envision the future, we always get trivialities such as the fashions and shape of cars wrong. Those sorts of visual cues are decided on a whim rather than a response to need. But most futurological predictions I have come across are almost spookily prescient in more significant respects. Take this extraordinary forecast, made in 1661-70 years before Samuel Madden - in a scientific treatise by the philosopher Joseph Glanvill, a clergyman and chaplain to Charles II, and a founder member of the Royal Society. \"To them that come after us,\" Glanvill wrote, \"It may be as ordinary to buy a pair of wings to fly to the remotest regions, as now a pair of boots to ride a journey; and to confer at the distance of the Indies by sympathetic conveyances, may be as usual in the future as by literary correspondence . . . I doubt not posterity will find many things that are now rumours verified into practical realities. It may be that, some ages hence, a voyage to the Southern tracts, yea possibly to the Moon, will not be more strange than one to America . . . the restoration of grey hairs to juvenility and the renewing of the exhausted marrow may at length be elicited without a miracle; and the turning of the now comparatively desert world into a paradise may not improbably be effected from late agriculture.\" </p> <p>By the late-Victorian era, futurology was becoming really quite slick. Jules Verne described, for example, how musical recitals would by 2000 be sent down a wire from the artist to pianos around the world. Well, MP3 music on the internet hasn't worked out quite like that, but it's hardly dissimilar. </p> <p>An American journalist, David Goodman Croly, writing in 1888 as Sir Oracle, predicted for the coming new century: \"Women throughout the world will enjoy increased opportunities and privileges. Along with this new freedom will come social tolerance of sexual conduct formerly condoned only in men. In addition, because of the greater availability of jobs, more women will choose not to have children.\" </p> <p>Twelve years later, another journalist, John Elfreth Watkins, having interviewed \"the wisest and most careful men in our greatest institutions of science and learning\" on behalf of The Ladies' Home Journal made a brilliant series of consumer predictions. The future, Watkins reported, would witness air-conditioning, international telephones, colour photography, frozen meals, medicine taken through skin patches, snowmobiles, the tapping of energy from wind, tides and sunlight - and out-of-season fruit. </p> <p>Most amazing of all, perhaps, was Watkins's prophecy that, \"Persons and things of all kinds will be brought within focus of cameras connected electrically with screens at opposite end of circuits, thousands of miles at a span.\" </p> <p>John Maynard Keynes, also writing at the end of the 19th century, even prophesied e-commerce: \"The inhabitant of London could order by telephone, sipping his morning tea in bed, the various products of the whole earth and reasonably expect their early delivery upon his doorstep; he could at the same moment and by the same means adventure his wealth in the natural resources and new enterprises of any quarter of the world, and share, without exertion or even trouble, in their prospective fruits and advantages.\" (Modern web shoppers will applaud Keynes's foresight, but regret that the \"delivery upon the doorstep\" part has yet to be sorted out.) </p> <p>Oddly enough, the would-be seers who consistently get the future wrong are specialists in their field, the media's beloved \"experts\", whose futurological track record isn't nearly as good as that of those whose approach is that of the generalist (aka, inspired guessing). </p> <p>The first expert futurologist was probably the Dorking vicar and demographer, Thomas Malthus, who in 1798 anonymously wrote a sensational pamphlet sounding the alarm on overpopulation. People had been complaining of overpopulation since Horace in 20BC, but Malthus was so convinced humanity would run out of space within a few years that he favoured effectively culling the working class, for which he was later derided by Karl Marx as \"a miserable parson\". </p> <p>Two hundred years on, Malthus still has his fans, and the fashion for apocalyptic forecasting grows apace. In 1964, a British physicist, John Fremlin, speculated in New Scientist on population trends for the coming 1,000 years, and argued that by the middle of the 29th century, 60,000 trillion people, a million times today's population, would spend their lives lying prone and eating recycled human bodies in cubicles in 2,000 storey buildings spread across both land and what had been sea. </p> <p>The apocalyptic certainty of choice today, of course, is global warming, which if its advocates are right, would be the profoundest ever future prediction. It is worth noting, however, that just a couple of decades ago, many of the same experts were confidently predicting global cooling , and a new ice age. \"A new ice age must now stand alongside a nuclear war as a likely source of wholesale misery and death,\" said International Wildlife magazine in 1975. The next year, Science magazine reported that we were \"heading for extensive northern hemisphere glaciation.\" </p> <p>Even experts proferring non-apocalyptic futurology have been hugely and entertainingly wrong over the years. The Nobel prize winning physicist, Ernest Rutherford, the founder of nuclear physics, once declared that talk of nuclear power was \"moonshine\". Britain's astronomer royal, Sir Harold Spencer Jones, dismissed the idea of space flight as \"bunk\" in 1957 - a fortnight before the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1. </p> <p>And then there was Thomas J Watson, the former CEO of IBM, who never quite lived down a statement he made in the late 1940s: \"I think there is a world market for maybe five computers.\" (Perhaps he really meant five computers per household.) No wonder that, in another of his dictums, Arthur C Clarke said that \"when a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right, but when he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.\" </p> <p>So what predictions for the next century would I make, having interviewed dozens of both expert and generalist futurologists, and explored the pitfalls and triumphs of past futurology? Well, I can't see the old favourite, household robots, ever taking off - another massive instruction book to read, another machine to drive us mad with software seizures. </p> <p>It is hard, similarly, to see artificial, computer intelligence being much of a starter, although it's promised for as early as 2015. Even if it could be achieved (which human brain experts are very sceptical of, pointing out that our most powerful computer currently has the intellect of an earthworm) there would, surely, be no market for computers which, when given a boring job, told you to do it your damned self. </p> <p>We like computers, surely, for their artificial stupidity . And if they get too clever, won't they soon start complaining of cruelty? (You laugh, but cruelty to computers is said to be close to becoming a social issue, and is already being discussed by acade mics specialising in human rights.) </p> <p>Genetic engineering will, I strongly suspect, also fail to deliver a fraction of what its advocates promise. There will be endless cases reported in the press around 2025 of people who supposedly had the \"criminal gene\" edited out of their DNA, and subsequently been convicted of car theft. Likewise, parents who paid to have the \"gay gene\" excised (probably illegally) from their children's make-up and ended up disappointed by the result will be locked in litigation with the clinics who did the genetic work. </p> <p>Time travel, I can't see happening either. It took the great Stephen Hawking to point out the obvious objection - that if it were possible, surely we would have seen tourists from the future by now? Quantum teleportation a la Star Trek is said to be a possibility, however. But whether a teleported human will arrive at his destination complete with his mind and memory intact will be an interesting one to watch. </p> <p>Medical advances, meanwhile, may well soon make death a lifestyle option rather than an inevitability, and this could have extraordinary repercussions. If you take the view, for example, that religion has only existed for the past few thousand years because of our fear of death, could the prospect of eternal life finally destroy religion once and for all? And could that, in turn, lead to an overwhelmingly amoral society? </p> <p>Space travel - and the eventual colonisation of other planets is probably inevitable if we all live for hundreds of years - may throw up some interesting conundrums too. For what will be tax position of the colonists? The first generation living on another planet may feel allegiance to the country that paid for their trip and the building of their base. But thereafter, it seems probable that Mars-born humans who only know Earth as a dot in the night sky, might resist attempts to tax them. Maybe there will be a space repeat of the 1773 Boston tea party? </p> <p>One thing is certain for the future. Just as we fervently believe we are living in a special time, and are a special generation witnessing a huge turning point in human affairs - so will our grandchildren and their grandchildren. Every generation thinks the same, and they're always just a little bit wrong. </p> <p>\u0095 A Brief History of Tomorrow: The Future, Past and Present, by Jonathan Margolis, is published by Bloomsbury, priced \u00a314.99</p>",

  "<p>The floods have been described by the environment agency as the most widespread in Britain since 1947 and, in some places, more severe. </p> <p>During the great floods of that year, several months of harsh winter were followed by the worst flooding for a century. After nearly a month of rain and melting snow, 30 of the 40 English counties and a large part of Wales were flooded. </p> <p>Nottingham experienced the highest flood waters since 1875 and new development on its flood plains meant it was one of the worst hit areas. Twenty eight miles of streets, 3,000 properties and 86 factories were flooded. The cost of the damage was estimated at \u00a312m. </p> <p>The heavy snowstorms and sub-zero temperatures caused economic chaos. More than 4m workers were made idle by power cuts. With hundreds of coal trains unable to travel through 20ft high snowdrifts, thousands of homes were without heat or light for long periods. </p> <p>In Norfolk, Lincolnshire and Yorkshire, the RAF dropped food for stranded villagers and their animals. Sheffield was left without milk. A hamlet near Widecombe in the Moor, Devon, sent a telegram on February 12 saying: \"No bread since Jan 27. Starving.\" </p> <p>Channel shipping was halted by non-stop blizzards, threatening food supplies. Fishing fleets were confined to ports and air travel ceased. The Great North road, Britain's north-south artery, was blocked for 22 miles and hundreds of rail passengers were left stranded by huge drifts. </p> <p>Troops were called in throughout the country and 500 prisoners were enlisted for snow clearance in Yorkshire.</p>",
  "<p>According to weekend reports, tens of thousands of motorists set out to see the latest tourist attractions - the high water at Bewdley and York. That implied they had enough petrol to make the pilgrimage, which in turn meant that they had queued at the pumps or, more likely, that tales of forecourt famine had been exaggerated. For drivers to fail to make any connection between their leisure use of motor vehicles and the possible causes of the floods in global warning due to carbon emissions is, sadly, all too typical. For environmentalists the motto has to be \"only connect\". </p> <p>And yet the vast expansion of rivers out of their usual course does make a tremendous sight. If the property damage, human injury and public inconvenience can be put out of mind, the great spread of the waters on the land is indeed biblical to behold. The several Ouses and the Severn, the Derwent and the several Avons, placid and stolid one season, now run swollen and fast; they periodically undergo a personality change that demands human witness. </p> <p>We gave up personifying natural phenomena as part of our passage to civilisation and yet it is hard not to read character into the inland waterways. Some streams are pacifist by nature. Others never make the headlines, not because they never flood but because - chance or good policy - they are lined not with brick and puny embankment but acres of water meadow. Take the Welland or, for much of their course, the Trent and the Tweed. The Severn below Gloucester spreads as nature intended, as do the Forth east of Stirling and the Kent, with that huge sandy bowl of Morecambe Bay to fill. The Nene and Witham safely pour their excess into the great sump of Fenland. Some, heroic in a past life, carved gorges and deep channels, too narrow to allow much riparian building. A minority just will not stop offending. Pity those who live beside those recidivist rivers of Avon, Ouse and Uck.</p>",
  "<p>The floods posed a fresh hazard last night when it emerged that the rising waters of the Severn were threatening a chemical plant. </p> <p>Firefighters in protective suits were checking safety at the Cleansing Services Group plant at Sandhurst, near Gloucester, where last week six people were taken to hospital after an explosion and fire. </p> <p>About 50 villagers were evacuated afterwards and dozens have since complained of stinging faces, sore throats and stomach pains. Health officials later took blood samples from villagers and results are expected this week. </p> <p>As storms swept the country with 34mm of rain falling on Cornwall yesterday, Yorkshire remained the area worst affected seeing people evacuated from the village of Selby on Saturday night. </p> <p>Police guarded empty properties from looters while soldiers sandbagged river defences in the town centre. </p> <p>Inspector Malcolm Green of North Yorkshire police said: \"At the moment we are monitoring the height of the river very carefully.\" </p> <p>Deputy prime minister John Prescott spent another day touring flood-ravaged areas of Yorkshire and promised long-term assistance to help people get back on their feet. </p> <p>\"I would like to see a recovery team which is there as the people go through a process of change, finding accommodation, finding heaters, getting the insurance companies to help to quicken the process to relieve the damage they face and the misery. When the cameras are gone I want the pressure still there to help.\" </p> <p>He criticised insurance companies following reports that some were demanding inflated premiums or rejecting applications altogether. </p> <p>The government will urge insurers to scrap rules requiring claimants to restore flooded homes to their previous condition, even if the old design, such as wooden floors, did not represent the best protection from further floods. </p> <p>\"I have received a lot of complaints about how slow they are dealing with claims and sometimes the work is not of a good quality,\" Mr Prescott said. </p> <p>Insurers warned yesterday that repeatedly flooded homes could become uninsurable. </p> <p>House prices could fall by as much as 25% in areas where the risk of flooding is highest. Once-desirable riverside properties have taken a knock in value, while homes in flood-devastated areas have been taken off the market. </p> <p>The Law Society will announce early next year that solicitors must include any \"environmental risk\" to a property - particularly flooding - when checking a house. </p> <p>The society has been liaising with the environment agency, which from next month will make flood risk information available to the public on its website, on a postcode basis. </p> <p>A spokeswoman said: \"We have been working to produce an improved property search making a number of environmental questions standard. </p> <p>\"At the moment flood risk isn't routinely checked for in property searches by solicitors.\" </p> <p>The government is to change planning guidance for local authorities, making it easier to reject applications to build on land liable to flooding. </p> <p>Andrew Bennett, the Labour chairman of the environment select committee, claimed the government's housing policies were partly responsible for the flooding. </p> <p>He said the vast extension of house building meant water drained off the land into rivers far more quickly, increasing the likelihood of flooding. </p> <p>A 13-year-old boy died on Saturday after slipping on rain-sodden cliffs and plunging 60 feet onto rocks at Sharkham Point, near Brixham, South Devon. </p> <p>Although the weather was good at the time of the accident, the cliff tops were muddy and slippery after days of torrential rain and the rocks were treacherous.</p>",

  "<p>The Ministry of Defence is to flatten two hills and cut down 150 acres of environmentally sensitive woods so it can sell an historic airfield for use by private executive jets. </p> <p>The MoD is using crown immunity to avoid seeking planning permission to make the airfield at Farnborough, famous for its international air show, attractive to a potential buyer. </p> <p>The airfield is being sold off as surplus to military requirements. But is not thought safe enough by the civil aviation authority unless the hills and trees are removed from the flight path. </p> <p>Local environment groups are alarmed because the area contains sites of special scientific interest, home to some of Britain's rarest birds - the nightjar, dartford warbler and woodlark - although the MoD said the site would be improved by its works. </p> <p>The MoD has already sold a former research station at the airfield for \u00a357m for the area to be used as a science park but has negotiated a much larger sale with the multi-national company TAG Aviation for the airfield itself. This sale, for an undisclosed sum of more than \u00a3100m, was on condition that the CAA was prepared to grant a licence for its use as an airport for executive jets. </p> <p>TAG is investing an additional \u00a380m in new airport buildings while the MoD demolishes the nearby Eelmoor and Miles hills. The sale of a 99-year lease on the airfield is expected to be finalised in 2002. </p> <p>Rick Kimber, spokesman for the Blackwater Valley Friends of the Earth, said that in addition to rare birds, the site contains a number of spiders and beetles which are endangered as well as grass snakes and lizards which are becoming increasingly rare. </p> <p>\"This kind of activity by the MoD shows why we need a countryside and rights of way bill. Under the new legislation the MoD would not be able to get away with this sort of behaviour. They realise that if they had to apply for planning permission they would have a lot of trouble persuading people that destroying the habitat of these species was necessary.\" </p> <p>One hill is losing seven metres (21 feet) and the second two metres, and Mr Kimber claimed a third small rise called Norris hill was also \"being scalped\" as part of a plan to flatten out the whole area. The 50,000 cubic metres of earth being moved will be dumped in the natural hollows between the hills. </p> <p>In 1996 the MoD decided it no longer needed the establishment and began the search for a buyer. One condition of the sale is that the biennial air show, which is used to sell civil and military aircaft, should continue. </p> <p>Keith Holland, chief planning officer for Rushmoor council, said it supported the MoD's wish to sell off the airport for use of executive jets and TAG was granted outline planning permission last month. </p> <p>The MoD allows executive jets to use the airport along side military aircraft but under the plan, permitted aircraft movements would double to a maximum of 28,000 a year. </p> <p>\"Clearly the MoD is entitled to go ahead without planning permission for its works to make flights safer. They did ask us if there were any objections as they are obliged to do. We consulted various bodies and there were no objections so they are going ahead.\" </p> <p>Katherine Chatters, for English Nature, the government's statutory watchdog, said she had not objected because if the work was carried out properly the removal of scrub and trees would restore the site to lowland heath which would provide improved habitat. </p> <p>An MoD spokesman said that the decision to \"remodel\" the hills and cut the trees down was taken on safety grounds for military and civilian aircraft and was not made specifically to satisfy the CAA and facilitate the sale to TAG Aviation.</p>",
  "The government risks labelling all homeless people as cheats and drug addicts with its \"misjudged\" campaign urging the public not to give to beggars, Shelter warns today. <p>A \u00a3240,000 advertising blitz will be launched today by the Cabinet Office minister, Mo Mowlam, and Louise Casey, director of the Rough Sleepers Unit, which argues that pennies given to beggars may \"go towards the fiver needed for the next heroin hit\". </p> <p>National newspaper and magazine adverts will call on the public to \"change a life\" by donating to homeless charities in the run-up to Christmas. </p> <p>But in a forthright attack on the initiative, Britain's biggest homeless charity warned that it would send out the wrong message. </p> <p>Chris Holmes, Shelter's director, said: \"We agree that we must tackle the problems of begging and street culture. However, in this instance we feel unable to support the strategy, which we believe is misjudged. </p> <p>\"Some of the headlines already generated by this campaign risk over-simplifying the issues at the expense of vulnerable people on the street.\" </p> <p>The charity warns that the government risks intensifying hostility to rough sleepers, who already live in a \"very dangerous environment ... They are more likely to be attacked and abused.\" </p> <p>Ms Casey, who was formerly deputy director of Shelter, is concerned that giving change to beggars fuels drug and drink addiction. </p> <p>But Shelter warns that while there are gaps in services to treat homeless drug addicts, drinkers and the mentally ill, withdrawing money from beggars will simply leave a vulnerable group of people with no money and no escape route. </p> <p>\"If people are forced to find other ways to maintain a drugs habit, they may be forced into more serious crime, or working for drug dealers. Any messages which deter the public from giving to beggars, however subtle, will compound the existing stigmatisation.\" </p> <p>In Brighton, which has a high concentration of rough sleepers, the local newspaper has conducted a campaign against beggars. The Evening Argus has been praised for its campaign by Ms Casey and by the Home Office minister, Lord Bassam. </p> <p>The anti-begging campaign has come under fire from social policy academics, who protested to Tony Blair that it was \"potentially harmful\". Dons, including Ruth Lister of Loughborough University, warned it was likely to lead to an increase in crime and prostitution. </p> <p>The latest government figure for the number of rough sleepers is 1,180. Shelter says this is likely to be an under-estimate. </p> <p>Shelter is urging the government to draw up a task force bringing together voluntary agencies, the Rough Sleepers Unit, the Home Office, police, DSS, and psychiatric experts to develop long-term strategy.</p>",
  "<p>Flood-stricken areas of Britain were preparing for more misery and disruption last night as strong winds and torrential rain blew in from the Atlantic. </p> <p>The new band of heavy rain and wind sweeping across Britain meant some areas were facing up to 50mm of rain overnight, and the worst-hit regions were bracing themselves for renewed flooding. </p> <p>The storm dumped 34mm of rain in the south-west yesterday and was due to move across southern England and the Midlands, reaching Scotland today and tomorrow. </p> <p>As Sir John Harman, chairman of the environment agency, warned \"we are by no means out of the woods yet\", the agency said it was monitoring the situation minute-by-minute. </p> <p>A spokeswoman said that although rain falling in the hills would take a couple of days to reach the flood zone, any heavy rain would cause localised flooding because the drains were full. </p> <p>Last night 21 severe flood warnings were in force on five rivers in Yorkshire, the Midlands and Wales, with a further 66 flood warnings across the country. </p> <p>In the Midlands, the river Severn had peaked at Gloucester by midnight on Saturday, with the city escaping further damage. But the environment agency said the predicted rainfall could return the Severn to critical levels over the next few days. </p> <p>In Yorkshire, the river Ouse peaked in York at more than five metres on Saturday - the highest levels since records began - but had started to drop yesterday. </p> <p>However, flood defences at Barlby and Selby were overwhelmed and around 200 properties flooded. Work was being undertaken to shore up the bank but a further high tide was expected yesterday. </p> <p>The storms are expected to last into Tuesday, while the swollen rivers could take many days to return to normal levels. </p> <p>Deputy prime minister John Prescott's weekend announcement of \u00a351m to shore up flood defences over the next four years was described as \"finger-in-the-dyke stuff\" by Friends of the Earth. </p> <p>Mr Prescott, who visited Selby and surrounding villages early yesterday, reiterated his message that more robust planning of emergency services was required. </p> <p>\"People tend to think this is going to come every 20 or 30 years,\" he said. \"Climate change is making a fundamental difference. Since 1987, there have been three major floodings and they are becoming more frequent.\" </p> <p>Homeowners were facing a new threat as springs which have lain dormant for hundreds of years began leaking thousands of gallons of water into low-lying areas.</p>",
  "The chancellor Gordon Brown will this week hand out billions of pounds in his pre-budget statement in an attempt to quell growing popular discontent over fuel prices, pensions and the rising tax burden. <p>In what has been described as the most delicate political judgment of his career, Mr Brown will offer a number of concessions in an effort to remove the increasing perception of arrogance and incompetence surrounding the government. </p> <p>He will hope to assuage some public anger over high fuel prices by targeting tax cuts for low and middle income families. And he will also give away millions to homebuyers willing to move into deprived inner city areas by announcing the targeted scrapping of stamp duty. </p> <p>Mr Brown's statement on Wednesday has been designed to counteract Tory plans to reduce income tax. He hopes to define the election battleground, pledging to increase the value of the new children's tax credit and making the working families tax credit - the tax break for the working poor - more generous. </p> <p>Although there are expected to be some concessions to hauliers and farmers, who have been pressing for huge cuts in fuel tax, the help offered is unlikely to be on anything like the scale demanded. </p> <p>In a speech to the CBI today Mr Brown will insist that the planned concessions will not require plundering his budget surplus, so jeopardising his overall economic strategy. </p> <p>\"Even when tested by events like rising oil prices, our resolve will be constant,\" the chancellor will say. </p> <p>The prime minister Tony Blair highlighted the dilemma, saying yesterday that he could easily win a reputation for listening, but lose his reputation for economic competence if the government gave in to the fuel protesters' demands. </p> <p>However, in the first clear sign that the road haulage industry will gain some respite, Lord MacDonald, the transport minister, said the chancellor will do what he can to ease pressures on the industry. </p> <p>He conceded that British industry was facing growing competition from foreign hauliers. The likely solution is the so-called Britdisc, a tax to be paid by all hauliers, including foreigners, operating inthe UK. However, British hauliers would be compensated for the cost of the disc through parallel cuts in Vehicle Excise Duty. </p> <p>The package is also likely to include help for rural petrol stations. </p> <p>The official haulage industry associations are still pinning their hopes on a 15p cut in diesel duty for hauliers - costing \u00a31.5bn. A refusal to cut diesel duty for hauliers could reunite a politically fractured industry by pushing the more moderate association leaders into the hands of the rank and file protestors. </p> <p>But the associations concede that ministers, previously reluctant to make the politically difficult environmental case for high fuel duty, have been emboldened by claims that floods hitting large swaths of Britain have been caused by global warming. </p> <p>In a sign that the protesters recognise their position is weakening, they have slashed their demand for a 26p cut in general fuel duty down to 12p. Brynle Williams, the more moderate figure in the People's Fuel Lobby, may make further \"negotiating concessions\" when he meets Lord Macdonald today. Popular support for further protests over fuel has fallen to 58%, in line with Labour's private polls. </p> <p>The protesters also issued a statement promising not to stage a go-slow down the motorway if they go ahead with plans for a convoy from Jarrow to London next week. </p> <p>The move came after Lord Macdonald predicted that police would arrest anyone breaching the Highways Act. </p> <p>The shadow environment secretary Archie Norman also spurned disruptive tactics, saying he did not wish the convoy to take place. \"We're saying don't do anything which is going to inconvenience the general public, which is going to break the law.\" </p> <p>In a move designed to underline the competing pressures on the Treasury, Mr Brown is expected to meet Lady Castle on Tuesday following a pensioners' rally in London. </p> <p>Treasury sources promised that there would be above inflation increases in the basic state pension as well as other transitional arrangements before the introduction of the new pensioner credit in three years time. </p> <p>Although attention in advance of the announcement has focused on the fuel protests, the chancellor's themes will be encouraging entrepreneurship, safeguarding the environment and reducing poverty.</p>",
  "<p>The government is to consider closing off vast areas of the North Sea to cod fishing as scientists warn of a drastic drop in stocks of the fish. </p> <p>Cod numbers in the sea have slumped so low that the European Union is being advised to close areas to trawlers for the first time in the history of European fishing policy. </p> <p>The British government has indicated that it would follow scientific advice in order to ensure the industry can survive. </p> <p>The International Commission for Exploration of the Sea (ICES), meeting this weekend in Copenhagen, is concerned that the drop in numbers is so severe it may mean the end to commercial fishing for cod. </p> <p>Scientists on the ICES advisory committee on fisheries management believe drastic action is needed and are recommending that spawning grounds be protected at all costs. They want large areas closed for three months in spring to give the few adult fish there a chance to breed. </p> <p>EU fisheries ministers will meet to discuss the advice in December when they fix fishing quotas for next year, but they said at their June meeting that they will closely follow the advice of scientists. </p> <p>ICES fears another Grand Banks fiasco, which occurred off Newfoundland, Canada, 10 years ago. Repeated scientific warnings about the imminent collapse of cod stocks were ignored and the vast shoals that once made this the most productive sea in the world vanished and have not recovered. </p> <p>The scientific advice will not be disclosed until Thursday when EU governments are informed of the ICES recommendations but closure of large areas is the favoured option. There are other management suggestions such as a reduction of fishing but these alone are not thought to be enough. </p> <p>The crisis has unfolded over years. Annual cod catches in the North Sea were routinely more than 350,000 tonnes, but the last time this figure was exceeded was in 1970. Numbers have fluctuated since then, with scientists warning that stocks might crash. Last year the quota was 132,000, tonnes but only 128,000 tonnes were caught by one of the most hi-tech fleets in the world. </p> <p>Most of the shoals found in 1999 were undersized fish below breeding age. As a result much of the breeding stock was wiped out and scientists recommended a 40% cut to 81,000 tonnes this year. By the middle of October only 62 % of this quota had been caught - the fishermen simply could not find the shoals. </p> <p>Joe Horwood, deputy director of the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science in Lowestoft, said: \"I do not know what the recommendations are but the research shows the state of the cod stocks is very severe. Our work shows there are very few cod, and far fewer small ones for future years.\" </p> <p>Last year, for the first time, parts of the Irish Sea were closed to all fishing during the cod breeding season from February to April. A known cod-breeding area round the Isle of Man was declared off limits. The success of the policy was based on the cooperation of local fishermen who believed it was the only way to safeguard their jobs in the long term. </p> <p>Dr Euan Dunn, a marine policy officer for the RSPB, said: \"With most of the old mature fish fished out, the age structure of the North Sea cod is highly imbalanced. In short we have a spiral of diminishing returns which affects not just numbers of fish but also their size and market value.\" </p> <p>A spokesman for Elliott Morely, the fisheries minister, said he was aware of the problems of North Sea cod. \"The minister would not be averse to closing part of the North Sea if that is what is needed to ensure the long term survival of the industry,\" he said. </p> <p>When the Canadian stocks failed to recover, one explanation given was that the number of breeding adults was reduced so much that all their eggs were eaten by predators and their place in the ecosystem was taken by other fish. </p> <p>Another was that global warming had increased the water temperature and cod were no longer able to breed so successfully. Scientists have already warned that the North Sea is warmer and that cod survival is threatened for that reason alone.</p>",
  "<p>It was only ever a matter of time before scientists pointed to one of the toxic agrochemicals pervading the world and linked it to a major disease of unknown cause. </p> <p>Today, Professor Tim Greenamyre, of Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, will do just that - suggesting at a conference in the US that exposure to rotenone could cause Parkinson's disease, the crippling brain illness which brings suffering to 120,000 Britons. </p> <p>But, ironically, it is a connection that will shake some of the most ardent opponents of the use of synthetic pesticides in farming. For rotenone is no post-war insect killer cooked up in a corporate lab, but a natural product, extracted from the derris plant, and a mainstay of organic farms and gardens. </p> <p>The findings of Prof Greenamyre and his team, to be published next month in the journal Nature Neuroscience, show that rats repeatedly given rotenone not only develop the symptoms of Parkinson's - trembling and loss of muscle control - but acquire the distinctive microscopic lumps in the brain, known as Lewy bodies, that are a sure sign of the disease. </p> <p>\"These results,\" the scientists write, \"indicate that chronic exposure to a common pesticide can reproduce the anatomical, neurochemical, behavioural and neuropathological features of Parkinson's disease.\" </p> <p>A link between pesticides and Parkinson's, which affects the Pope, Michael J Fox and Muhammad Ali, has been suspected for some time. </p> <p>A review of 19 different studies over the past decade, carried out at the Ohio Medical College last year, reported that most found exposure to pesticides increased the risk of contracting Parkinson's. </p> <p>Critics of the pesticide theory point out that the mass use of man-made chemicals to control pests only began in the latter half of the last century, whereas James Parkinson first identified the symptoms of what he called \"the shaking palsy\" back in 1817, and there is evidence that the disease goes back much further. </p> <p>But rotenone, in the form of the powdered root of the derris plant, was used on a large scale in the industrial world from the mid-19th century onwards. In some countries, it has an even longer history. </p> <p>Derris-based pesticides are on sale in garden centres across Britain. Rotenone is sometimes used to control populations of fish, for which it is highly toxic. </p> <p>One bottle of rotenone pesticide on the shelf of a garden shop yesterday was labelled as \"a traditional insecticide\" and \"a natural plant extract.\" </p> <p>A spokeswoman for the Ministry of Agriculture said yesterday: \"It's too early to say what the safety implications of this study might be. It will be put forward to our pesticide safety directorate toxicologists who will decide whether a review of this particular pesticide needs to take place.\" </p> <p>Although the Atlanta scientists have pinpointed rotenone, they make it clear that they believe other pesticides which work in the same way could be equally dangerous. </p> <p>Benoit Gaisson and Virginia Lee, Parkinson's researchers at Pennsylvania University, said the work did raise questions about rotenone's safety. </p> <p>\"Rotenone is a naturally occurring substance that is eventually degraded in the environment, and as such it is considered to be benign compared to many other pesticides,\" they wrote in Nature Neuroscience. \"Whether rotenone exposure contributes to the incidence of Parkinson's disease remains to be determined. Nevertheless, the effects of chronic rotenone administration observed here may be representative of the possible effects of exposure to low amounts of other environmental toxins, yet to be identified.\" </p> <p>One theory is that exposure to one or several pesticides combines with an individual's genetic makeup to cause Parkinson's. The Pennsylvania researchers said the fact that the risk of getting Parkinson's rose sharply with age fitted in with the notion of the drip-drip effect of environmental toxins over time. </p> <p>In Parkinson's, cells in the brain that produce dopamine, which carries signals between nerve cells, begin to die. The reasons are not understood, but a major clue came in the 1980s, when an attempt to create an illegal designer drug went spectacularly wrong. The guinea pigs who took the drug, MPTP, were struck down with a rapid-onset version of Parkinson's. </p> <p>MPTP interfered with a key component of the dopamine-producing brain cells, the mitochondria, the \"power stations\" of cells. Rotenone and other pesticides have a similar effect, although rotenone appears to produce symptoms much closer to typical Parkinson's disease than MPTP. </p> <p>The Atlanta team believes that at the heart of the problem lies a kind of toxic waste produced by the mitrochondria as they generate energy. This waste comes in the form of rogue molecules called free radicals, which barge around the body, damaging vital functions. One theory holds free radicals responsible for normal ageing. </p> <p>Even in healthy people, the mitochondria in dopamine-producing cells are thought to produce a high level of these free radicals. The Parkinson's-causing effect of pesticides may be to increase the amount of \"waste\" the mitochondria produce, causing the death of the cells. </p> <p><br><strong>'You tell your body to move - and it doesn't'</strong></p> <p>It seemed trivial yet it was troubling. The instructor at the toddlers' gym where Maureen McHugh had taken her son asked the parents, as part of an exercise, to wiggle their fingers. Her brain responded, but her fingers didn't. </p> <p>\"I couldn't wiggle the fingers in my left hand,\" said Dr McHugh, 44, a soil scientist from Aberdeenshire. \"I started to lose mobility on my left side. Everyday tasks became difficult.\" </p> <p>That was in 1996. Despite signs that something was badly wrong, she did not consult a doctor until 1998, when she was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. </p> <p>\"Your brain tells your body to move and it does not,\" she said. \"It's going to get steadily worse. It's not supposed to shorten your life - it just makes life a complete misery.\" </p> <p>Since being diagnosed, Dr McHugh has been taking the drug L-dopa, which relieves Parkinson's symptoms. It does nothing to treat the cause, and can itself lead to serious disability after long use. But for the time being it enables her to carry out everyday tasks such as driving and helping her partner David Mills with their children. </p> <p>\"I'm fairly incapable at times,\" she said. \"Before I went on the medicine, I was virtually unable to do anything. Now I can do most normal things in a limited way, although I have to plan in advance.\" </p> <p>Dr McHugh has spent hours studying research into Parkinson's. She believes the evidence of a link between the illness and chemicals in the environment is strong. Over the years she has been exposed to different toxic chemicals in her work, but doubts that a single chemical such as rotenone is to blame. </p> <p>With hopes high that a treatment to end Parkinson's may be on the horizon, Dr McHugh is campaigning with other members of the Special Parkinson's Research Interest Group (Spring) to persuade the government to relax restrictions on scientists who believe the best hope of a cure lies in the using human stem cells to create new nerve cells to replace damaged ones. </p> <p>The only source of human stem cells is surplus human embryos donated by couples undergoing IVF treatment and at present scientists are barred from using these for research into anything other than fertility problems. </p> <p>\"It's vital that the government make these changes,\" said Dr McHugh. \"The embryos in question are very early. An individual being hasn't been established at that point.\"</p>",
  "<p>What is the point of leaving parties? Why do we all pile into a wine bar on a wet Friday night to get to know somebody we will never see again? Professor Alec Reed, founder of the Academy of Enterprise, but better known as the chairman of Reed Employment, raised this simple question recently at a personnel conference in Harrogate as an illustration of how the relationship between employers and employees has changed. </p> <p>We supposedly live in an age of insecurity, of short-term contracts and temporary assignments. The trend took off during the recession at the start of the 1990s, but it has continued to grow as we near what statisticians count as full employment. The fly-by-night nature of temporary assignments makes it hard to estimate how many people are temping, but the best guess is that it is about 1.2m on any given day, and rising. About a quarter of these temps will be in secretarial or admin positions. But, argues Reed, it is employers who should feel insecure over this arrangement. </p> <p>As competition for staff increases, it is employers who will have to be more flexible in understanding what workers want. Reed cites the example of a senior manager in his own organisation who quit to train as a ballet dancer in Moscow. People at all levels have aspirations and unless employers learn to cultivate these they will lose their best workers. </p> <p>The old model of exemplary staff relations is gone - \"such traditonal employee champions as Marks &amp; Spencer are crumbling before our eyes,\" says Reed. Instead of paternalism, Reed advocates maternalism. \"In our maternal approach, we offer an interest-free loan to co-workers [Reed's term for employees], a home computer scheme, confidential counselling and free training. Co-members may take any non-vocational lessons they please, whether they be tennis lessons, pottery classes or flamenco dancing, and we will pay half the cost.\" </p> <p>The switch from paternal to maternal is not a temporary reflection of the strength of the labour market, however. It is not the case that, come the next recession, we must brace ourselves to hang up our ballet shoes and be grateful for the free white wine at the Christmas party. Indeed, most temps would probably be astonished at the idea that they are the shock troops of a new economic order. </p> <p>Yet Reed is adamant that a fundamental change has taken place in the economy. \"It is people,\" he says, \"who determine the strength of a business venture.\" His arguments hinge on the most basic economic principle of supply and demand. There is a glut of goods, there is a glut of investment capital; what is in short supply are talented people who can create the added value which will persuade a jaded and sophisticated public to buy. But since creative people are in short supply, the cost of employing them shrinks the profit margins. The individual is more powerful than the organisation. </p> <p>So the theory goes, and it is convincing enough to persuade one of the merits of becoming a creative person. If you are a temp, however, you might already be more creative than you realise. Because it is temps who are probably best adapted to an environment in which, in Reed's words, \"we work where we want, for whom we want, when we want\". </p> <p>Reed dates his belief in what he calls \"peoplism\" to 1994. It is certainly the case that, in 1996, Reed Employment released some interesting research into the state of morale in the office. It was found that permanent workers felt far more insecure than the temps they increasingly found themselves working alongside. It appeared to the permament workers that they had only one asset - their knowledge of their own particular job - which they had every reason to suppose might disappear at any time. Temps, by contrast, had a wide range of experience. </p> <p>There is no doubt that the new world of peoplism is not always as stable as one would like. The notorious Kelvin McKenzie reportedly used to greet recruits to L!ve TV by shaking hands twice \"in case I'm not in the office when you're fired\". Reed's suggestion that employers should learn to hold joining parties, as opposed to leaving parties, sounds altogether more pleasant.</p>",
  "<p> * Trees on the road, flooded motorways, tubes not running, train services non-existent . . . all these ready-made, argument-proof excuses, and still you choose to struggle into work, martyr-like, in the vain hope that the boss will reward (OK, we'll settle for recognise) your fortitude and dedication. Only to find, of course, that the boss has decided to take the day off. Well, who wouldn't, in this weather? </p> <p>The advantage, though, of manfully dragging yourself, drowned and wind-beaten, into the office is that you have all day to compare tales of commuter woe (at home, you just get stuck listening to other people's problems on TV phone-ins with no chance of adding your own moans). WPM has heard, via the grumble-friendly medium of email, of several plucky workers who have sacrificed hours they could legitimately have spent wrapped up warm indoors, braving the elements. One man battled for two hours to complete a half-hour car journey from home to his workplace in Dorset. The winner in this nationwide tale of misery, however, has to be the office worker whose journey from Beckenham, Kent, to Waterloo in central London took an astonishing five hours, instead of the expected one hour, leaving home at 6.45am to arrive in the office at a quarter to twelve. So, just in time for a lunch break, then. </p> <p>*WPM can only hope that Britain's bosses have cast a forgiving eye over the lateness of their employees in this most trying of weeks. Such kindness would, of course, be totally out of character, but then again, since when were tornados considered typical of Bognor? </p> <p>Bill Morris, general secretary of the Transport and General Workers Union, told a conference last week that employers should stop \"whingeing\" about new measures aimed at improving the workers' lot, such as family-friendly policies. While companies bemoan red tape and bureaucracy, he not unreasonably pointed out that staff \"have been starved of the proper information and consultation rights, are cheap to sack and easy to replace.\" WPM, for one, refuses to believe that she would be easy to replace. But as for the rest, he might well be on to something. </p> <p>*Stress last week, and pain this - but the internet's not all fun, you know. Which is why WPM's website of the week is <a href=\"http://www.tifaq.com,\">www.tifaq.com,</a> otherwise rather less catchily known as \"typing injury frequently asked questions\". Such as, why won't my boss believe that my keyboard is killing me? It's an American site, with RSI and other complaints taken as established medical facts - there's none of that \"oh, it's just a crippling pain in my wrists that means I can't move my hands; it'll clear up in a day or two\" attitude here. There are links to what's going on in Europe too, with a report from the TUC on preventing workplace strain injuries. Plus plenty of info on alternative keyboards and ergonomics. One to leave on the boss's screen? </p> <p>*Mind you, there are some American ideas that are best left on that side of the Atlantic. Last year, US new media agency Organic hit upon the simply fabulous idea of a bring-your-parents-to-work day. Undeterred by the experience, they're bringing the concept to their global offices, including London, this month. Apparently, letting mum and dad roam around your workspace reassures them that their expensively-educated offspring are actually doing something resembling a proper job. </p> <p>WPM refuses to believe it. Apart from the fact that such an exercise would prove that WPM could in no way claim to be doing a \"proper\" job (remember whose standards we're going by here), the parents would no doubt have just a few little ideas on how things could be done so much better around the office. And, if WPM's mother were ever allowed to set foot in her workplace, it would be only a matter of time before serious desk-tidying would be a condition of having an afternoon flapjack, and not sitting up straight would warrant instant dismissal. And mothers who used to be secretaries can be very dismissive of non-stratospheric typing speeds, you know . . .</p>",
  "<p>Is a dyslexic secretary an oxymoron, an obvious contradiction in terms? According to the British Dyslexia Association (BDA), an estimated 4% of the population are severely dyslexic, but not all know that they are. </p> <p>Problems may only become evident in jobs where an individual's weaknesses are pushed to their limits. And administrators will undoubtedly fall into this field. </p> <p>News last week of a new website (<a href=\"http://www.dyxi.co.uk)\">www.dyxi.co.uk)</a> that claims to be the world's first web portal designed by dyslexics for dyslexics to discuss issues that affect them in the workplace serves to highlight the lack of commercial websites for dyslexic job- seekers. So, if you are trying to enter the workplace, or even if you have a secure position but happen to be dyslexic, can you or your boss do anything to ease the situation? </p> <p>Dyslexia is recognised as a disability under the Disability Discrimination Act. There are two ways in which an employer might unlawfully discriminate against a disabled employee or job applicant: first, by treating him or her less favourably (without justification) than other employees or applicants because of his or her disability; or, second, by not making reasonable adjustments (again, without justification). </p> <p>The problem with dyslexia is the stigma attached to admitting openly that you find reading and writing a problem. You need only to have suffered the nightmare that is the recruitment process to know that securing a job is, for most of us, the biggest hurdle of all on the path to a successful career. Imagine if you had the added complication of not being able to spell? How should employers and employees be approaching the interview process? </p> <p>Carol Orton, policy and information manager at the BDA, wrote a recent research paper, Recruitment - the dyslexic candidate, which looks into this area. Candidates in any recruitment process are immediately forced to read a copy of the job description and, if selected, are required to fill in an application form. For administration positions in particular, they will almost certainly be asked to complete a spelling test, too. So, argues Orton, three hurdles are instantly presented. </p> <p>How can employers help? On a practical level, personnel officers can use clear text when devising application forms. A flexible approach to accepting application forms via email or on disk will allow dyslexic applicants to complete the form by computer, thereby removing worry about presentation and enabling the use of a spell-check facility. While the use of coloured paper other than white for forms is seemingly irrelevant to a recruiter who has no reading difficulties, dyslexics often find pastel colours easier to read. </p> <p>Aptitude tests can also be modified. A first step, suggests the BDA, is to consult the dyslexic applicant to find out what adjustments might be required. Recruiters can help by allowing extra time for written papers where appropriate; 25% extra time is recommended. The importance of the entrance tests in relation to the job being applied for must be explained clearly to the candidate and alternative methods of eliciting the required information, such as verbal assessments and diagrams, should also be considered. </p> <p>With one in 10 people currently affected by dyslexia in a mild form, and one in 20 affected severely, a significant proportion of the population are at a disadvantage in the office. Juliet English, press officer at the BDA, insists that employers must wake up to today's workplace. \"The economic benefits of encouraging all employees to reach their full potential is obvious in business.\" She says that people calling attention to their dyslexia during the recruitment process and opening up dialogue with bosses will discourage the development of a culture of fear. </p> <p>How can administrators in particular make their lives easier? Suggesting small adjustments to the office environment, such as clearly labelled files, and tapes for dictation instead of written notes, can vastly improve individual working lives. There are now bespoke computer packages that offer a continuous spell-check facility, among other options, that can work on practically any Windows programme, word processor, spreadsheet, encyclopaedia, web page, Help File or educational programme. Administrators could make their boss aware of this. </p> <p>In the wake of dyslexia awareness week last week, the recruitment industry and employment organisations alike need to take heed. Geoff Armstrong, director general of the chartered institute of personnel and development, concludes that \"companies will benefit if they understand dyslexia - it is an area in which personnel and development professionals could usefully play a leading role.\" So that dyslexic secretary shouldn't need to worry at all. </p> <p>* British Dyslexia Assocation: <a href=\"http://www.bda-dyslexia.org.uk;tel\">www.bda-dyslexia.org.uk;tel</a> 0118 966 8271 * <a href=\"http://www.dyxi.co.uk\">www.dyxi.co.uk</a> * Saville &amp; Holdsworth Ltd has produced guidelines for testing people with disabilities.
