  "<p>Companies in the 21st century have to be aware of a triple bottom line - profit, society and the environment. And naturally young managers are now demanding their MBA courses cover issues like ethics, environmental sustainability and social concerns. </p> <p>This year the Association of Business Schools officially recognised the importance of ethical business practice with the introduction of a special Business and Society section in its annual Business Schools Awards, sponsored by Clerical Medical and supported by the Guardian. </p> <p>The winners, Alex Nicholls and Charlotte Opal, who were Masters of Business Administration at the Said Business School, University of Oxford, impressed with a project to establish a fair trade wine in the UK, which they are promoting themselves with independent wine retailers as outlets. </p> <p>Their MBA included several subjects relevant to ethical trading. The Global and Comparative Business course included a detailed analysis of the stakeholder model of operating a company, which takes account of workers and local communities. </p> <p>\"We looked at business philosophies, comparing the Anglo-American shareholder model to the German Japanese stakeholder model in which workers have interests in the company,\" explains Opal, a Rhodes Scholar. </p> <p>The aim of fair trade is to make sure that people in developing countries earn a living wage and that the production process is environmentally sustainable. </p> <p>Nicholls and Opal made a research trip to South Africa to investigate social and ethical concerns such as the lack of labour rights protection for vineyard workers and the illegal practice of paying workers in wine. These aspects - and the monopolistic power of multi-national wine exporters in Mexico - had to influence their business plan. But the problem for businesses that wish to be ethical and for consumers is the complicated nature of third world economics. While the developed world, for example, views child labour as undesirable, a child's earnings may be essential to its family, so the issue of business ethics becomes complicated. </p> <p>\"Consumers want to do the right thing,\" says Opal, \"but they don't necessarily know what the right thing is and so have to trust the trader.\" </p> <p>British business schools are only just introducing ethics in business to their MBAs. Warwick University set up its corporate citizenship unit two years ago but it is the only one in the UK. </p> <p>Professor Malcolm McIntosh explains that the world is changing and that organisations need to have values. \"They have to understand the different forms of capital, not just financial capital but relationship and social capital.\" </p> <p>It was young managers themselves who wanted social accountability in business to be part of their MBA courses. Now, he says, businesses have to take responsibility for such matters as human rights, environmental and social impact. </p> <p>\"Business does not operate in a vacuum. The rules of the game are such now that we have to be aware of all stakeholders, customers, staff and the communities in which companies operate. You can't make money unless you understand people's values.\" </p> <p>Companies have to be aware of the triple bottom line - profit, society and the environment. Professor McIntosh believes a cluster of British companies, including Shell and BP, are leading the way in this sea change. </p> <p>At Strathclyde School of Business, ethics has also become a core part of the MBA. \"The aim is not to judge but to be a way of making students aware of the wider range of factors which will affect the environment they work in,\" says Professor George Cairns. </p> <p>They have to consider the political, legal, environmental and social framework and look at the various ethical considerations in different countries. </p> <p>Students can go further into the moral minefield with two electives, one that looks at business ethics in more detail and a course in Power and Organisations. Apart from looking at power structures inside organisations, this elective looks at the power of organisations on a macro level and considers how people exercise power, says Prof Cairns. </p> <p>Using TV documentaries of the Union Carbide disaster at Bhopal and its consequences over a decade, tutors encourage students to consider the issues involved. </p> <p>Halfway through the case study, students are asked to put themselves into the positions of the stakeholders and think about how the problem is unfolding from their point of view. </p> <p>\"I think it works,\" says Prof Cairns. \"I hope the students go out with the capacity to look at things from different perspectives.\"</p>",
  "Sirimavo Bandaranaike, the world's first female prime minister, died of a heart attack today after voting in Sri Lanka's parliamentary elections. Bandaranaike, the widow of another former prime minister of the Indian Ocean island, died aged 84 on her 60th wedding anniversary. <p>Bandaranaike stood down in August to let her daughter, President Chandrika Kumaratunga, appoint a hardliner in a bid to boost the government's 17-year fight against Tamil separatists ahead of today's elections. </p> <p>Bandaranaike had gone to her hometown, Gampaha, 22 miles east of Colombo, to vote. She suffered a heart attack in her car on her way home after casting her ballot, and was pronounced dead after being taken to a nursing home, government spokeswoman Kusum Rodrigo said. \"I think the entire nation has lost its mother,\" said Alavi Mowlana, a government minister for local affairs. \"I cannot believe that she is no more.\" </p> <p>Bandaranaike retired on August 10, suffering from diabetes and other ailments. She said that her daughter needed someone more capable of pushing proposals to end the civil war, which has claimed 63,000 lives since 1983. \"I believe it is time for me to quietly withdraw from the humdrum of busy political life, to a more tranquil and quiet environment,\" Bandaranaike wrote as she ended a 40-year political career. She was elected the first woman head of government on July 20, 1960, six years before Indira Gandhi became India's first woman prime minister. </p> <p>Born Sirimavo Ratwatte on April 17, 1916, Bandaranaike was a member of one of the island's wealthiest families. In 1940, she married Soloman Dias Bandaranaike, a senior politician in the United National party, which was governing what was then called Ceylon. </p> <p>Her husband later broke away to form his own Sri Lanka Freedom party and was elected prime minister in 1956. A Buddhist monk assassinated him three years later. </p> <p>Bandaranaike was transformed from shy housewife into a political dynamo. She campaigned for her husband's party in the 1960 elections and became its leader, winning elections later that year. </p> <p>Her election was so unusual that newspapers were unsure what to call her. \"There will be need for a new word. Presumably, we shall have to call her a stateswoman,\" one British newspaper wrote. \"This is the suffragette's dream come true.\" </p> <p>In September 1961 at the Neutral Summit Talks in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, she made history by being the first leader to say she was speaking \"as a woman and a mother\". She governed until 1965, lost the next elections, then regained power in 1970. </p> <p>Shifting toward the left, Bandaranaike ordered the US peace corps out in 1970 and closed the Israeli embassy. In May 1972, she made the country a republic and changed its name to Sri Lanka, and during her second term, she nationalised private companies and banned imports. She used the military to crush a 1971 insurrection by Marxist rebels, and up to 20,000 were believed to have died. </p> <p>Parliament expelled her in 1980, accusing her of misusing power, and banning her from office for seven years. Her civic rights were restored in 1986, and she narrowly lost the election for the new, more powerful post of president in 1988. </p> <p>Suffering from diabetes and a knee problem that put her in a wheelchair, Bandaranaike reduced her political activities. </p> <p>In 1993, Ms Kumaratunga took over the party's leadership and, when elected president a year later, she appointed her mother prime minister, a position that has become largely ceremonial.</p>",

  "<p>Web agency Lateral has taken its first step towards developing its much-talked-about network infrastructure, tentatively called Uni-Lateral.</p> <p>The first agency within the network has been named as lshift, which will concentrate on back-end technology solutions. Lateral is believed to have invested around \u00a3150,000 in the project in return for a 20% stake and a seat on the board. Other agencies that cover media, PR, strategy, creative and technology are also being mooted.</p> <p>The thinking behind the the expansion strategy is that Lateral will be able to tap into talent across the network without taking the agency past its self-imposed limit of 30 staff. </p> <p>Andy Wilson, chief executive and co-founder of lshift, said: \"Talent in this industry is being vastly underused. The idea of lshift is to create an environment where geeks want to work and where people want to stick together.\" </p> <p>Mr Wilson, who previously worked at Red Kite and Zinc, said the idea for Uni-Lateral came through conversations with Lateral chairman Jon Bains about what was wrong with web development agencies. </p> <p>Mr Bains said: \"There's a massive flux of people coming and going in the web development industry, with the average churn rate among agencies at around 20%. The bigger agencies have grown too quickly and now house a massively underdeveloped workforce. With new media retainers starting to disappear, there's a big recession around the corner.\" </p> <p>Lateral is talking to strategic investors aiming to get them involved with the network on a project-by-project basis. </p>",
  "<p>On a day when nearly everything in the technology, media and telecommunications world was moving sharply lower, the solid performance of <strong> BSkyB </strong> was remarkable. </p> <p>Against the weak trend of the sector, shares in the satellite broadcaster fell just 2p to 970p as the market's shrewder players examined the possibility of a takeover. </p> <p>Traders reckon the buyer is likely to be Sky Global Networks, the company which is at present being groomed for market flotation by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. </p> <p>Sky Global Networks is to become the holding company for all Mr Murdoch's digital broadcasting operations - ranging from Star TV in Asia to its controlling 37.5% stake in the British satellite broadcasting platform, BSkyB. </p> <p>The plan is to incorporate all these assets into Sky Global Networks and then float the company on the Nasdaq exchange later this year. </p> <p>The flotation promises to be the biggest in media history, with the company being valued at anything up to $40bn. </p> <p>Sky Global Networks already has its first strategic investor in the shape of John Malone, the American cable pioneer. Recently Mr Murdoch has been signalling his desire to bring on board another strategic investor. </p> <p>The name being mentioned is Vivendi, the French media group which already owns a 21% in BSkyB. </p> <p>At a recent dinner Tony Ball, the chief executive of BSkyB, is said to have told investors that it is extremely likely Vivendi will join. </p> <p>If Vivendi is invited to join Sky Global Networks it is likely to exchange its BSkyB stakeholding for a minority holding in Sky Global Networks. In the event that Vivendi does so, a full takoever bid for BSkyB might be triggered automatically because - according to dealers - Sky Global's stake in the satellite broadcaster will have reached 58%. </p> <p>Takeover panel rules state clearly that should the owner of a 30-50% stake increase its holding it is required to launch a takeover bid. </p> <p>However, the panel tends to look such events on a case by case basis - allowing a so-called whitewash if it thinks a bid unnecessary - so nothing can be taken for granted. </p> <p>Moreover, Mr Murdoch's relationship with his opposite number at Vivendi, Jean-Marie Messier, has been troubled, to say the least. </p> <p>Yet this did not stop analysts advising their clients to pile into the stock yesterday. Paul Reynolds, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, was telling his clients that holders of BSkyB shares at the time of such a deal are likely to receive a decent price. BSkyB, however, refused to comment. </p> <p>After last week's respite, London's blue chips reverted to their downward trend. Once again the culprit was Nasdaq, where a truly dismal performance on Friday - the Nasdaq posted a three-figure decline - was followed by another yesterday. </p> <p>The FTSE 100 closed down 126.4 points at 6,264.8, wiping out all of last week's 97-point gain. However, turnover in blue chip stocks was only 630m - the lowest since late August - suggesting that the day's move was more of a mark down than a genuine sell-off. </p> <p>Elsewhere, the FTSE 250 eased 92.7 to 6,576.7 and the Techmark fell 135.5 to 3,593.12. </p> <p>Hi-tech and telecoms stocks bore the brunt, with the worst hit being internet security group <strong> Baltimore </strong> , down 55p to 605p, chip designer <strong> ARM Holdings </strong> , off 53p to 672p, and cable company <strong> Telewest </strong> , 11p weaker at 127p. </p> <p> <strong> Reckitt Benckiser</strong> managed to buck the trend, rising by some 28p to 881p. The household goods company has been seeing investors in the run-up to third quarter figures. Home shopping group<strong> GUS</strong> was another riser, up 2p to 439p ahead of an expected trading statement on Thursday. </p> <p>Lower down the market it was more of the same, with technology stocks sinking. Online directory group <strong> Scoot.com</strong> fell 15.5p to 100p and <strong> Psion</strong> shed 65p to 630p. </p> <p>Over on AIM, <strong> Sportscard Group</strong> made a solid debut.

  "In life, Isaam Joda was a tall, strapping man, but when they lifted the sheet from his body at the morgue yesterday, doctors revealed a shocking sight. <p>Amid a welter of blood, cuts and bruises, the soft skin of his inner arms and left thigh was scarred by pink ovals of seared flesh. A doctor peeled back his right eyelid, pointing to a black mark caused, he said, by a cigarette. </p> <p>According to Bassem Rimawi, director of emergency services at Ramallah's main hospital, Joda was tortured and beaten to death. He believed the wounds on the dead man's arms were caused by a hot iron. </p> <p>The account of torture is repeated by Joda's neighbours in the West Bank village of Um Safa, north-west of Ramallah, and by Palestinian human rights workers. </p> <p>They say Joda was beaten to death by extremist Jews from the West Bank settlement of Halmish. They accuse Israeli security forces of handing Joda over to the settlers, knowing his life would be in danger. </p> <p>Israel categorically rejects the charge. \"This is a lie like so many lies. This is part of the cynical behaviour of the Palestinian side,\" said Colonel Gal Hirsh, who commands Israeli forces in the Ramallah area. \"I asked the Palestinians to join us and to make a combined investigation, and to send the body to one of our pathologists to check whether their claims are right. </p> <p>\"But they did not allow us to see the body. They captured it and took it to Ramallah.\" </p> <p>If the allegations are confirmed, then Joda's death is part of a disturbing new trend to emerge after nearly two weeks of violence in the West Bank and Gaza, as well as within the borders of Israel proper. </p> <p>During the past few days, there has been a spate of ugly attacks: Jews stoning Palestinian motorists, Palestinians firing on isolated Jewish settlements in the West Bank, beatings and stabbings. This is hatred at its most primordial: Jew killing Arab and Arab killing Jew. </p> <p>The Palestinian allegations go to the heart of the angry exchanges between the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, and the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat. Mr Barak has demanded an immediate end to the violence; Mr Arafat says such a request is insulting. Instead, he is asking for an international investigation into the deaths of nearly 90 people, almost all Palestinians, in the recent violence. </p> <p>The body of Joda, a house painter in his late 30s, was discovered yesterday morning and taken to the morgue at Ramallah's main hospital. </p> <p>He had last been seen driving near Halmish, on his way to a nearby cemetery where he had work painting the gates. But when he passed a jeep of Israeli soldiers on patrol, he sped away because his battered Fiat was carrying yellow Israeli plates, a serious security offence for a West Bank resident, witnesses reported. </p> <p>Joda was detained. But after his capture, Palestinians say he was turned over to Jewish civilians living in Halmish. \"I believe that after he was captured by soldiers he was put in the settlement and the settlers spent the whole night enjoying him,\" Dr Rimawi said. </p> <p>Col Hirsh denied the account, saying that his troops had no contact with Joda and that they had been under orders to keep a low profile during the Yom Kippur holiday. </p> <p>He said Joda died when his vehicle overturned. \"The man was driving too fast and he was probably smashed up by the impact of the accident,\" he said. \"As you know, it was Yom Kippur and no Jewish person or Israeli would have been on the roads at that time.\" </p> <p>However, the doctor's account is given more credibility by the admission to the hospital of an injured teenager, Mohammed Tamimi from Nabi Salih village, who told medical staff he was captured by the settlers at Halmish and badly beaten. </p> <p>Such attacks appear part of a new phase in the violence. Fired by their leaders' angry rhetoric and the horrific casualties of recent days, people are answering the call of ancient tribal loyalties. </p> <p>\"I live in the same area,\" Dr Rimawi said. \"I never thought of the settlers as prejudiced, but since the beginning of this intifada their attitude is changing. They are stoning our cars every day when we cross the road.\" </p> <p>In Nazareth, in the heart of Israel, hundreds of Jewish extremists attacked an Israeli Arab neighbourhood overnight. When the police arrived they fired rubber bullets at the local Arabs - not their assailants, killing two men. </p> <p>\"What is happening in Nazareth today is a pogrom, bearing all the hallmarks which were well known to Jews in tsarist Russia, that is collusion between the racist attackers and police,\" said Gush Shalom, from an Israeli peace organisation. </p> <p>Apart from Joda, the Palestinian health ministry reported the death of another man last night, shot in the head, apparently by settlers near Ramallah. A 70-year-old Nablus man was also reported beaten by settlers. </p> <p>A Palestinian human rights organisation yesterday accused the Israeli army of colluding with extremist Jews carrying out attacks on Palestinians and Israeli Arabs. Law, the Palestinian society for the protection of human rights and the environment, said three Palestinian men had been killed by settlers in the past two days. The murders were part of a wave of terror enveloping Palestinians, it said. </p> <p>\"For the past couple of days, settlers attacked Palestinian citizens and their property and their homes. They used firearms in their attacks while the occupation army turned a blind eye to their aggressive acts,\" Law said in a statement. </p> <p>The attacks were carried out in the old city of Jerusalem and nearby villages and refugee camps, as well as near the West Bank city of Hebron, a regular point of friction because of the Jewish island that sits in the middle of a large and crowded Palestinian city. </p> <p>They also occurred within sight of the Israeli army. \"Law views the bloody homicides that the occupation army commits against Palestinian civilians as opening the doors for settlers and extreme racists to commit more crimes and cause more bloodshed,\" the organisation said.</p>",
  "The value of people's money was fluctuating wildly, the mobile phone network was in meltdown, and money dealers stood confused: Yugoslavia's revolution has hit the currency black market. <p>Reports flew across the country that the currency, the dinar, was exchanging for the deutschmark at hugely different rates. \"Democratic change in Belgrade makes mess on the street currency market,\" read Vecerni Novosti's headline yesterday. </p> <p>In the central Serbian city of Cacak, the dinar fell from 43 to the mark to 25 and yet prices remained the same. In nearby Kraljevo, it later rose from 25 to 32. Money dealers stopped working and peasants and black market traders stopped selling because they couldn't price their goods. </p> <p>\"On Saturday, we were selling 38 dinars to the mark. On Sunday the rate was 22. Now we are selling at 25 and buying at 30,\" said one money dealer, Zoran Mitrovic. \"But everybody likes it and is cheering about what's happening. </p> <p>\"A stable situation is more important to them than prices,\" he said, adding that the disparity in buy and sell rates would narrow. </p> <p>Dr Milan Kovacevic, founder of the G17 independent economic thinktank, which is close to the new president, Vojislav Kostunica, explained why the dinar is gaining strength: \"Representatives from G17 met Yugoslav National Bank governor Dusan Vlatkovic on Saturday and he promised he would not sell foreign currency, and that he would stop printing dinars.\" </p> <p>Dr Kovacevic also explained that, psychologically, the mood across Serbia has changed. People are now counting on an influx of foreign capital, so they are not selling dinars. </p> <p>Mr Kostunica has improved the trade environment within the federation by lifting trade barriers between Serbia and Montenegro. </p> <p>The Yugoslav National Bank holds $285m (\u00a3197m) in hard currency. But, faced with economic difficulties, Slobodan Milosevic's regime resorted to printing money to repay debts. </p> <p>The national bank has been massively increasing the money supply over the past year - reducing the dinar's value. Prices subsequently rose to keep apace. Now both dealer and economist expect the rate to steady. \"I think the rate will stabilise - and probably go down,\" said Dr Kovacevic.</p>",
  "<p>The search for bridges over troubled waters was much in evidence at the Labour Conference in Brighton. At further education fringe meetings, including the Association of Colleges dinner, this was clearly the mood - the sector expressing anxieties rather than confidence about the immediate future. Ministers, of course, have carried the legislation creating the new Learning and Skills Council. The national chair, chief executive, chief inspectors, the chairs and executive directors of local learning and skills councils have all been appointed. Further education can readily appreciate the scale of the change, but it is many months away from receiving any of the benefits. </p> <p>As the Further Education Funding Council winds down, several of its key figures have not made the transition to the Learning and Skills Council. Colleges are waking up to the fact that old relationships are in decline. Not that such links were necessarily cosy, but \"better the devil you know\". Moreover funding council officers and inspectors have prided themselves on their open relationships with colleges, who overwhelmingly formed their client group. In addition the funding council enjoyed the confidence that its performance was appreciated in the area which counted most, central government. </p> <p>The quinquennial review gave the funding council a cleaner bill of health than any comparable quango. Moreover its low administrative costs and slim staff budget, only 2% of the total further education spend, won ministerial approval. Its regional structure applied a light touch, emphasising advice and support. Of course, on occasions it provided the evidence of college failings and formed rigorous judgments, but colleges could tap support without being enmeshed in the toils of excessive bureaucracy. The inspectorate in particular earned high marks for rigour yet accessibility. </p> <p>A different world awaits. The Learning and Skills Council was never a rebadging exercise for the funding council or the Training Standards Council or the TECs, though clearly some of their features and many of their people have their full part to play in the new body. The Learning and Skills Council is charged by government with a massive responsibility. A society in which far too many have limited educational achievements and skills is to be transformed into the lifelong learning culture fitting for the age of rapid technological and societal change. Colleges bask in the knowledge that they are its biggest client group and are crucial to its success and much of the central funding structure will remain in place certainly in the early years. </p> <p>Anxieties however mount, particularly as the local learning and skills councils take shape. Key appointments at local level emphasise that further education is only part of a much wider picture. In place of the regional structure of a national quango overwhelmingly dedicated to their role, there now rises the very different perspective of the local learning and skills councils. These bodies will enjoy much greater local input, not least by local authorities with their responsibilities in the post-16 and adult learning areas. Local employers and private training providers join the forum of decision takers in which the colleges participate. </p> <p>Opportunities, of course, abound. The colleges will eventually see the comparative costs and advantages of their provision against school sixth forms become subject to keen local scrutiny, although local communities will inevitably tread with care in this most controversial of areas. The inspectorate will ensure that the quality enhancement imposed with increasing rigour upon the colleges will obtain for the private training providers too. </p> <p>The price, however, will be the need for further education to argue its case in a much more intensive local forum in which it will be a minority interest in terms of representation, though the major provider. Further education is destined to come in from the cold. Yet for many in further education it may not be the problems of global, but of local, warming with which they will be wrestling. The level of disturbance means troubled waters. Further education needs to play its full part in ensuring that the local learning and skills councils are secure bridges of opportunity for the sector. </p> <p> \u0095 Lord Bryan Davies is chair of the Further Education Funding Council</p>",
  "<p>Does any hawk-eyed John Lewis store detective recall a dapper middle-aged gent wandering around the chain's Kingston upon Thames branch? He would have been gazing keenly at the huge open spaces, at the seamless merging of lighting into leather goods into soft furnishings, at the winding escalators, at the never-ceasing buzz. </p> <p>In one sense he was casing the joint. But don't fret, JL. The principal of South East Essex college of arts and technology wasn't planning some haberdashery heist. </p> <p>Tony Pitcher was seeking inspiration. He was about to ask a firm of architects to design new premises for his college, and he was going to issue probably the oddest request in the history of further education construction. </p> <p>\"Build me a department store.\" </p> <p>The architects, KSS, of Savile Row, took it on the chin. \"If we'd asked them to build us a new college, they would have had all sorts of preconceptions of what a college should look like,\" explains Pitcher, who prefers the title chief executive. \"So we said we wanted it to be like a department store. </p> <p>\"They were absolutely enthusiastic. They thought it was a really interesting architectural challenge, and not just another boring old technical college.\" </p> <p>Now the Further Education Funding Council has given its blessing to the \"relocation\" and, provided a couple of minor planning issues can be sorted, work should begin on this \u00a340m project next year. </p> <p>Sometime in 2003, it will open. And the punters will be forgiven for thinking they've strayed into Grace Brothers because, apart from the proposed college's design, it will share the new complex in the centre of Southend with some real shops in a brand new mall. Any shopper taking the wrong escalator from the atrium floor will miss Boots and fetch up in the college foyer. </p> <p>For a biggish chunk of the population, who get dragged under protest from Saturday sport on the telly, the typical department store is a foretaste of hell. So why would a college want to ape one? It's clearly no sudden whim. Over the past decade, since Pitcher took over as principal in 1991 of the then Southend college of technology, it has developed a style of operation that is radically different from the traditional model. </p> <p>As in a big store, there are no internal divisions. Learning is not done in classrooms, Pitcher says. It takes place in 20 \"learning centres\" - big rooms of up to 500 square metres. </p> <p>In each of these up to half a dozen groups of students learn. They're likely to be doing different courses, or at least different levels of the same course. The groups are served by teachers and \"learning advisers\" who assist students with particular problems. </p> <p>\"Teachers don't lecture except to give very short explanations of a concept when necessary,\" Pitcher explains. \"And students don't waste time copying down material which the teacher has taken from a book and copied out on the whiteboard.\" </p> <p>\"We're trying to avoid inefficient ways of communicating information,\" chips in David Howe, director of quality assurance. </p> <p>So where do students get their stuff? </p> <p>\"They get their material from worksheets and our intranet,\" says Pitcher. </p> <p>The college certainly bristles with computers. This is apparent when the principal, Howe and David Latham, director of resource development, take the Guardian on a tour of the current premises near Southend Victoria station, and half a mile from the new site in the town centre. </p> <p>This five-floor steel-framed and glass building was designed in the late 1950s along standard technical college lines. But now there are no walls, or very few. The television and sound recording studios, for instance, are enclosed, and for obvious reasons. </p> <p>\"Students get the feeling of working for a large purposeful organisation, not as an isolated group with one teacher,\" says Pitcher. \"It's the sort of busy beehive feeling or of being in a modern department store. We're preparing students for a modern working environment.\" </p> <p>Howe recalls one visitor remarking that it was more like a building society than a college. \"I think they were being damning. I saw it as a compliment.\" </p> <p>Removing walls boosts student performance and improves behaviour, the trio firmly believe. \"It has been shown that students' behaviour is moderated by the size of the space they're in and the presence of people doing other activities ,\" says Howe. \"An NVQ student might be energised by seeing people doing an HND in the same subject,\" says Latham. </p> <p>The transition to the new style caused student recruitment to double from 1992 to 1995, says Pitcher. The college now has 3,550 full-time and 6,000 part-time students. </p> <p>And how do teaching staff feel, exposed to such open display rather than safe in their own enclosed domains? </p> <p>The revolution required gradual introduction and thorough explanation. Quite a few staff back in the early 1990s were apprehensive and there was a significant dash for early retirement, says Pitcher. \"But after a while the nervous staff were those whose departments we hadn't yet introduced this method to.\" </p> <p>The open-plan, learning-centre mode benefits teachers in many ways, he says. They pick up skills from their colleagues, who learn from them in return. And any problems they have are quickly spotted. </p> <p>\"The old method depends heavily on the skills of each teacher, who alone had to manage the learning of 25 to 30 people.\" </p> <p>In the traditional classroom, even the most promising rookie teacher takes a few years to find out what works. In their own capsules they get little or no help from colleagues. Meanwhile, their students don't get the best. </p> <p>The openness extends to the learning materials which staff produce. It's all the intellectual property of the college and has to be entered onto the intranet to be available to the next teachers needing it. </p> <p>The college gets an increasing number of visitors from colleges here and overseas. Recently a delegation from Benenden, Princess Anne's old school, came calling and showed great interest in the learning centre method. Other colleges have adopted part of the method. Some had tried it and concluded it doesn't work. </p> <p>It is a \"student-centred\" approach, says Pitcher. And like the \"child-centred\" methods so reviled as trendy nonsense by rightwing newspapers over the past decade it attracts suspicion. </p> <p>\"It shouldn't be underestimated,\" says Howe. \"It's complex and only works if the whole jigsaw is in place. </p> <p>\"When critics say it doesn't work, it's because they haven't fitted in all the pieces of the jigsaw.\"</p>",
  "<p>There are invisible children in our schools. Ask teachers and they immediately recall examples - the excruciatingly shy pupils who seemed to melt into the background, visibly shrinking when questions were asked or averting their eyes when addressed. </p> <p>At break they were the forlorn figures standing apart from the hurly-burly. They were the troubled ones who never gave any trouble. </p> <p>Kim Gregory is worried about her nine-year-old, Gary: \"He is very lonely but he tries to dismiss his problems. He says, 'Oh, I don't mind, don't worry'. He's so ultra considerate - always at the back of the line, the one who gets the last sweet when they are being handed out. I fear one day he will explode.\" </p> <p>A Hampshire mother, unwilling to reveal her identity, tells a similar tale of her 12-year-old: \"He is completely lacking in self-confidence and is becoming very isolated. He is unnaturally well behaved. The teachers say he is so 'nice and polite', but they don't see how sad he is at home. His behaviour is convenient for them.\" </p> <p>It's a view shared by health campaigners and professionals. \"Children who act out will get the most notice,\" says Juliet Buckley of the charity Young Minds. Jeanette Newton of the Dudley Counselling Service feels that concern and funding is flowing predominantly to disruptive children. </p> <p>But for children whose instinct it is to internalise their worries, the consequences of having their troubles overlooked can have profound consequences. Last year's \"Bright Futures\" report from The Mental Health Foundation identified communication difficulties and low self-esteem as key risk factors likely to contribute to children developing a mental health problem. </p> <p>One organisation that focuses on the plight of the withdrawn child is the charity The Pyramid Trust. Since 1992, it has promoted a programme aimed at children of seven to nine - an age, according to the American psychologist Mortimer Schiffer, in which their main \"social hunger\" is for peer-acceptance. \"In our view this is the ideal time to intervene,\" says the trust's chief executive, Alan Watson. \"Every child deserves to have early signs of failure noticed and nipped in the bud.\" </p> <p>The trust has developed an approach which it \"franchises\" out to local education or health authorities. \"They contact us and we set them up as the local 'lead agency', responsible for promoting the idea among schools and then co-ordinating things once they get started,\" explains Watson. </p> <p>The trust provides a blueprint for running the three-stage scheme. First, teachers are invited to assess their classes using checklists. Next, their \"nominations\" are discussed at a special \"multi-service\" meeting of teachers, psychologists, school nurses and representatives from educational welfare. From this gathering emerges a shortlist of 10. These pupils are invited to join a special after-school club that runs for 10 weeks and is co-ordinated by an outside volunteer, trained by The Pyramid Trust and employed by the lead organisation. </p> <p>Once parents agree their children can attend, the club meetings begin. \"Often this is the first time they have ever been selected for anything,\" says Alan Watson. \"The clubs are designed to offer six key ingredients - love, security, praise, recognition, responsibility and new experiences - the children select a club name, design badges, cook, play games and there is always an outing. At the end there is a big farewell party.\" </p> <p>The rationale for this approach is the seeming long-term boost in confidence. Among many success stories one stands out. \"He started as a desperately alone child,\" says volunteer Jacqui Wood. \"He never played and his anorak was 'fuzzy' on one side because he spent his breaks circling the playground alone, leaning on the walls as he went.\" His headteacher, Sue Murry-Wicks, takes up the tale: \"After the club finished he had changed, now he can be seen playing football with the others.\" </p> <p>Alan Watson regards the positive experiences gained in the clubs as a kind of \"slow-release fertiliser\" in these children's lives. \"It builds their resilience to cope with subsequent buffets and, according to recent follow-up research, seemingly boosts their literacy skills, too.\" </p> <p>For Zarrina Kurtz, one of the authors of an as yet unpublished review for the National Health Service Executive of the outcomes of treatments of psychiatric disorders in childhood, the court is still out on the long-term benefits of this kind of intervention. \"But,\" she concedes, \"if something can be done to help a child overcome a difficult stage in their life, enabling them to succeed when they appear to be failing, then it may be giving them access to a whole raft of other positives.\" </p> <p>To date the National Pyramid Trust has run clubs in 86 schools for 930 children and has trained 280 volunteers. There are always more candidates than can be accommodated. What then for the thousands of \"invisible\" children slipping through the net, passing on to the even more daunting secondary school environment? Alan Watson is clear about the benefit of early intervention, but says it is never too late. </p> <p>At Cator Park School For Girls in Bromley, Helen Palmer is definitely of this view. She and her special educational needs team are developing a programme for children in years 8-10 based on the social skills training method devised by the clinical psychologist Susan Spence. </p> <p>The initiative also relies on teachers nominating pupils who give them cause for concern, eight of whom are offered the chance to meet together once a week for 16 weeks. The sessions explicitly target their social skills, with special questionnaires being used to prompt discussion about their feelings and experiences. </p> <p>Palmer's colleague Charlotte Thomas is delivering the sessions and already sees improvements only six weeks down the line: \"One girl was always covering her face - now she's making eye contact.\" </p> <p>Services such as Young Minds have to help pick up the pieces when things for anxious or withdrawn children reach crisis point. \"The isolation children experience at school can often be the raw material for much more serious difficulties later on,\" says Juliet Buckley. \"Of all the problems we receive calls about, depression ranks the highest. The invisible child today often becomes the adolescent hiding in their bedroom of tomorrow.\" </p> <p> \u0095 Bright Futures can be ordered from The Mental Health Foundation: 020-7535 7400.
