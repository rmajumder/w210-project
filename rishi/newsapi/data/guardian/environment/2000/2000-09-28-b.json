  "<p>Is bigger really better? That is the trillion-dollar question hanging over the launch in Japan today of the world's largest bank amid renewed fears about the health of the country's bloated financial sector. </p> <p>The formation of Mizuho Financial Group is supposed to be a symbol of the changes that Japan has undergone in the two years since its banking crisis threatened to bring down the entire global financial system. </p> <p>With assets of \u00a5134.4 trillion (\u00a3853bn), the group dwarfs it closest rival, Deutsche Bank. The company's president, Katsuyuki Sugita, says it can become one of the five leading instititions in the global financial community and a pioneer of new businesses in the domestic market. </p> <p>The launch comes against a backdrop of declining bank stocks, falling asset prices and growing concerns among politicians and investors that the problems of bad loans and poor profitability faced by Japanese banks are merely being swept under the carpet. </p> <p>Mizuho is a holding company formed by Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, Fuji Bank and the Industrial Bank of Japan as the first step towards a full reorganisation of their operations by 2002. The group's shares were listed for the first time yesterday on the Tokyo stock exchange. In October, the three banks' securities arms and trust banking affiliates will merge their opera tions. It is the biggest in a wave of mega-mergers engineered by the government to shore up the Japanese financial system after a decade of lax lending led to the collapse of three major banks and the near bankruptcy of several others. </p> <p>The government strong-armed the banks to accept the alliances in return for trillions of yen in public cash to stabilise their precarious finances. It justified the cost to taxpayers by arguing that the move would force the banks to clear up their bad loans and improve their profitability. </p> <p>But this is proving easier said than done. Despite huge write-offs over the past eight years by its three member banks, the Mizuho group begins life with \u00a54.7 trillion in bad debts, the biggest burden among the four Japanese major banking alliances. It must also repay the \u00a52.8 trillion it received from the government for recapitalisation. </p> <p>Like other banks it is suffering on the other side of the balance sheet, where its assets continue to decline as a result of falling land prices and a slump in the stock market since the start of the year. </p> <p>According to analysts, the outlook is not much brighter. A recent rise in interest rates is expected to push many firms into bankruptcy, which will mean more uncollectable loans. </p> <p>\"There is a great deal of concern about bad loans,\" said Paul Migliorato, a broker at Credit Suisse First Boston. \"And it's not likely to get better any time soon.\" </p> <p>As well as this tough business environment, the painful but necessary reform needed at Mizuho and other banking groups is not likely to have been helped by a change of political climate. </p> <p>With the end of the crisis, the sense of urgency in the government has dissipated. Since April, a new administration led by conservative prime minister Yoshiro Mori has taken a cautious stance towards financial sector reform that has alarmed many in parliament. It has supported weak construction companies, such as Hazama and Kumagai Gumi, that hold so many of the problem loans. </p> <p>\"Two years have passed since we started trying to clear up the financial system, but nothing has really changed. If anything the situation has deteriorated,\" said Yasuhiro Shiozaki, one of the legislators who drew up the banking reform plans two years ago. \"We are just postponing the difficult decisions.\" </p> <p>Investors have been rattled by similar concerns. Banking shares have lost more than 18% since August, compared to a 3% average decline by all stocks on the Tokyo stock exchange. </p> <p>Although Mizuho made a smooth debut on the Tokyo bourse yesterday, analysts have given a mixed judgement on plans to turn the company around. The group's executives have promised to improve profitability by diversifying into more lucrative areas of business, making better use of information technology and cutting 7,000 employees, 20% of the workforce. </p> <p>By 2005, the company said it will improve its return-on-equity ratio - the main measure of profitability - from 4% to 12%. Analysts have complained that this is slower than rival banking groups and still short of the 15% to 20% ratios usually offered in Europe and the US. </p> <p>\"The decision to merge was radical but the strategy for the bank is not as radical as the merger was,\" noted David Atkinson, a banking analyst at Goldman Sachs. </p> <p>Merging institutions is clearly only the beginning of the modernisation process.</p>",
  "<p>Denmark's cliff-hanging referendum on the European single currency was being closely watched by global financial markets after last week's intervention to halt its plummeting value against the US dollar. </p> <p>But beyond the short-term effect on the credibility of the euro, the Danish result could have significant implications for the future political development of the EU. There is also its potential knock-on effect on both Britain and Swe den, the other two EU members which still have to commit to the single currency. </p> <p>The outcome also means that the next countries to adopt the single currency could be the relatively poor candidate countries of central and eastern Europe, such as Poland and Hungary, which are expected to start joining around the middle of this decade. </p> <p>And it still leaves in the balance whether the EU will develop at two different speeds, with more integrationist-minded members forging ahead. </p> <p>With pressure already growing to formalise the role of the eurogroup - composed of the current 11, plus Greece, joining next January - moves to coordinate national economic policies more closely will not be far behind. Ecofin, the forum of all 15 EU finance min isters, of which the chancellor, Gordon Brown, is a member, could find itself being increasingly marginalised when key decisions are made. </p> <p>On the foreign exchanges, the euro traded nervously in a narrow range against the dollar, with dealers glued to screens showing the latest opinion polls, though last week's heavyweight intervention to prop up the single currency has limited the scope of foreign exchange market reaction. \"People are concerned about the big US beast lurking round the corner so that will limit the impact,\" said one analyst. </p> <p>Others were dismissive of any fallout from the Danish referendum. \"Are we seriously asked to believe that the votes of a few thousand Danes [the difference between No and Yes voters] will alter the fortunes of an economic area of 275m people?\" asked Nick Parsons, currency analyst at Commerzbank. </p> <p>Denmark continues to face a long-term problem over its other Maastricht treaty opt-outs, on defence and justice and home affairs, which are likely to be the main growth areas of European integration in the coming years. </p> <p>Last night's results were being watched closely in Stockholm, where the prime minister, Goran Persson, who unlike Mr Blair or Denmark's Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, does not have a formal opt-out on the currency, has to decide whether to call a referendum. </p> <p>The narrowness of the result will give little comfort to Europhiles, already concerned about an increasing trend towards cooperation among member states and a move away from the supranational European Commission in Brussels. The Danish message to an ambitious elite project could feed into long-standing concerns about the democratic deficit, expressed in the low turnout in elections to the European parliament. </p> <p>Across the continent, governments are already smarting from being taken by surprise by the recent protests over fuel prices, which the EU proved powerless to influence. </p> <p>The vote comes before December's EU summit in Nice, already due to debate a so- called \"flexbility\" clause which countries like France and Germany want to be able to form what President Jacques Chirac calls a \"pioneer group.\" </p> <p>Mr Chirac, whose country holds the union's rotating presidency, warned Mr Blair last June that if integration-minded states were not able to move forward within the EU, they would do so outside it.</p>",
  "<p>Close Brothers pledged to remain independent yesterday in the face of takeovers sweeping through the investment banking sector. </p> <p>The largest of the few remaining stock market-listed British investment banks will also resist any sale of its Winterflood Securities arm, where profits trebled last year as private investors clambered to buy dot.com stocks. As a result bumper bonuses are expected at the broking firm. </p> <p>Rod Kent, chief executive of Close Brothers, described Winterflood as \"one of our crown jewels\" and dismissed speculation that a sale of the business was planned as \"ill-founded and completely wrong\". </p> <p>\"In 25 years we have built up businesses and never sold them,\" Mr Kent said. </p> <p>In the face of the scramble by the leading investment banks to become even bigger, Mr Kent said: \"We're not global and we don't want to be.\" </p> <p>He insisted Close benefited when rivals were taken over, pointing to a team of Middle East specialists recruited by the bank from Robert Fleming after its sale to Chase Manhattan of the US. </p> <p>A \"fantastic period\" for Winterflood allowed Close to report a 103% rise in pre-tax profits to \u00a3155m. Of that profit figure, \u00a350m was generated from the explosion in share dealing between November and March during the height of the frenzied buying of hi-tech shares. </p> <p>The bank admitted that these hectic stock market conditions were unlikely to return during this year and lead to such a fast rise in profits. But, it insisted that the new trading year, which began in August, had started well. </p> <p>Winterflood has now expanded from its origins of executing trades in the UK stock market for private client stock brokers. It is offering share dealing services for European stocks and later this year will be able to buy and sell shares in the United States. </p> <p>Mr Kent also pointed to strong growth in Close's corporate finance and asset management operations, boosted by the acquisition of Rea Brothers last year. The bank has made its mark in advising smaller and medium sized business on mergers and acquisitions and on creating investment funds in niche markets such as hi-tech stocks. </p> <p>The once core business of Close Brothers, its asset finance business, was one of the poorest performing areas, hit by the falling prices of cars. It makes hire purchase arrangements for secondhand cars and will reveal in its annual report next week that profits fell from \u00a34.2m to \u00a3800,000. </p> <p>Mr Kent, who has run Close Brothers for the past 25 years, showed no signs of being ready to hand over the reins to a colleague. Despite the rapid rate of growth of Winterflood, he was determined to highlight the 31% rise in operating profits in the other parts of business to deflect criticism that the business was too reliant on the potentially volatile stock broking business. </p> <p>Close shares ended the day 5p lower at \u00a312.25. It will pay a final dividend of 17p, which takes the total for the year to 25p.</p>",
  "Well, during 40 years in politics, I've been the warm-up man for some really class acts: Jack Jones, Barbara Castle, Neil Kinnock, John Smith, Tony Blair - and even my old mate Dennis Skinner. <p>But in all my days I've never been so proud, so happy, so honoured as to be the warm-up man for the next person coming on this stage - Nelson Mandela.</p> <p>What a week it's been! We had that bridge, sponsored by Unison. I'm not sure after yesterday's \"goings on\" whether it was a \"bridge of sighs\" or a \"bridge over troubled water\".</p> <p>And talking of the bridge, there is an announcement to make. Would the person who at the start of the week stepped in some yellow paint, please report to the standing orders committee? </p> <p>But more importantly, we've had great speeches, frank discussion, robust debate.</p> <p>This party has great ambitions, great desires for our people. But at the end of the day, it's not like opposition. When you're in government, you have to make choices and priorities. </p> <p>That's what Nye Bevan meant when he said \"the language of priorities is the religion of socialism\".</p> <p>And I want to thank all of you for your hard work throughout the year in our policy forums and discussions. </p> <p>We've had the odd disagreement this week. But don't lose sight of the huge range of policies we have determined this week.</p> <p>And wasn't that a great and inspiring speech from Tony on Tuesday - even if he was heckled by baby Leo half way through?</p> <p>Cherie and Tony are so proud of him. They can't wait to take him to his first focus group.</p> <p>And David Blunkett's been listening. David's got the message. Free nursery places for all three-year-olds. That's delivery - just in time for Leo's third birthday.</p> <p>Tony set out his vision and offered us leadership. He said it loud and clear - we have a vision worth fighting for!</p> <p>And, it will take sacrifice, effort: yes, blood; yes, tears; and, well - perhaps I'd better not mention the sweat, Tony.</p> <p>You should worry - he put his arm round me!</p> <p>Anyway, Tony's sent his suit to the cleaners. But I tell you what, at the next election we're going to take that Mr Hague to the cleaners.</p> <p>Conference, it's been 1,200 days since we were elected. And Tony and I have got the bags under our eyes to prove it.</p> <p>But Gordon's got the bags in the bank! (Only joking Gordon.) And he's not been short of advice this week on how to spend it.</p> <p>Leadership. Now, there's a lot of talk in the party about leadership.</p> <p>Yes, leadership is easier when things are going your own way. But the true test of leadership is during the harder times when you have to make difficult decisions. </p> <p>Home and abroad, Tony doesn't shirk them. In Tony Blair we've got a leader who is right up there in the top rank. Respected here, in Europe and on the world stage.</p> <p>And a man who can lead us into a second term. And Tony, no deputy could have a better leader to help him.</p> <p>So whether an election comes in six months or 18 months, we must be ready, now. Ready to put our case. Ready to go to every part of the country. Ready to go to the cities and the towns, and yes - ready to go into the villages and countryside to put Labour's case.</p> <p>Like you, I just can't wait to get stuck into those Tories. Tories? Tories? This opposition? - what a lot of chancers!</p> <p>William Hague - he gives guarantees here, guarantees there - guarantees galore. But would you believe him?</p> <p>I'd sooner take a guarantee from Del Boy than William Hague. Come to think of it. I'd have more chance of getting a remit from Rodney than a genuine guarantee from Mr Hague.</p> <p>Still, happy retirement, Rodney. The platform wishes you well. But I'm sure you will be back. After all, people said Jack Jones and Barbara Castle were going to retire. And that was 20 years ago!</p> <p>One thing's for certain, Hague's' not retiring before the election. He's getting ready. Make no mistake.</p> <p>You know, he's had another one of his weird \"bonding sessions\" for the Tory shadow cabinet. All those old Val Doonican sweaters were out again.</p> <p>During the break they had to watch William \"Bruce Lee\" Hague doing his judo with Sebastian Coe. He's still learning. He's not got a black belt or a brown belt, yet. But he's just qualified for a green belt.</p> <p>Most Tories thought a \"green belt\" was just somewhere to build a supermarket - and make a few bob. Chop and change.</p> <p>The Tories are a joke, but they are a very dangerous joke. Because of what their policies and their promises mean for people.</p> <p>The Tories. They're a party which gave us the \"common sense revolution\". A fresh start to policy, they said. It lasted three months.</p> <p>They gave us a tax guarantee - that is, to cut taxes whatever the state of the economy. That lasted one month.</p> <p>They then launched their mini-manifesto, in the summer - that lasted one week.</p> <p>They were asked time and time again, would they cut the fuel tax?</p> <p>Hague told Jimmy Young : \"I don't think we should chop and change from week to week. It's not my job to ride around on every bandwagon.\"</p> <p>Six days later, there he was, promising a tax cut, shouting, \"any more room on that bandwagon? Got room for a little one?\"</p> <p>So there we have it. \"Fourteen pints\" Billy Fizz, drunk in charge of a bandwagon.</p> <p>We all knowm, you can never trust what the Tories say. I call them the Burger Kings of British politics - every minute another whopper!</p> <p>Cheap and nasty. Not only do their policies change every day, so do their slogans.</p> <p>In the summer they had \"compassionate Conservatism\". I couldn't believe my ears. Hague, Portillo, Widdecombe, Redwood - \"compassionate Conservatives\"?</p> <p>Think about it. It's a contradiction in terms. They only have to say it, because no one believes it in the first place. In my book, \"compassion\" means consideration, caring and concern.</p> <p>Did they show any compassion when they put 3m people on the dole?</p> <p>Did they show compassion when they stopped the free eye-tests for pensioners?</p> <p>Did they show compassion when they destroyed hundreds of mining communities?</p> <p>Did they show compassion when they left people homeless, sleeping rough on the streets?</p> <p>That's not compassionate conservatism. It's callous Conservatism. </p> <p>They haven't changed. They're worse than ever. Their trademark is pandering to fear and prejudice.</p> <p>The way they talk about asylum-seekers - many of them fleeing from the horrors of war and persecution.</p> <p>The way they behaved over section 28. Abolishing section 28 isn't just about tolerance and dignity. It's about children being protected from bullying. </p> <p>It was pandering to bigotry. That's what was so disgraceful about their behaviour.</p> <p>Their latest target is doctors from overseas. I tell you, when they insult doctors and health workers from overseas, it's an insult to all public servants. An affront to all of us who use and value our national health service.</p> <p>My family doctor's Asian. I've been with him for years. I'd like to thank him and all those who helped create and serve our great national health service - from whatever land they came.</p> <p>And who made this attack? Can you believe it - it was a doctor. Dr Liam Fox, the Tory health spokesman. Liam Fox. Now you know what I think about fox-hunting. But in his case, I'd make an exception.</p> <p>So never, ever trust these Tories. Every day we're reminded of it. What about Jeffery Archer? One minute he's courting the press, the next minute he's pressed into court. </p> <p>There he is, charged with telling lies. I thought to myself, why stop there? Why not charge the whole damn lot of them for the lies they have told?</p> <p>So I say to Jack Straw, there's a case for a class action! Politics of organisation and the politics of ideas. Talking about action, you know I've always believed that the politics of organisation is as important as the politics of ideas.</p> <p>We know we can't rely on all the ladies and gentlemen of the press to get across our message. They've got their own agenda. We've got ours. And the job of everyone in this party is to set our agenda, not to feed theirs.</p> <p>People want to hear about real policies. Not the tittle tattle of years ago. So, we've got to take our message directly to the people. Face to face, on the doorstep, in the shopping centre, on the bus. </p> <p>That's the way we've always done it. And that's the way we must do it today.</p> <p>To keep on building that trust with the people, to win the battle of ideas and to win that second term we've all worked so hard for.</p> <p>Membership - conference, in that battle, we need every person we can to join our fight. Our membership is the backbone of our organisation.</p> <p>Too many of us just got out of the habit of recruiting new members. We must ask people to join the fight, to stay with us, to get involved and work with us.</p> <p>Our MPs, party staff, ordinary members are gearing up for the campaign ahead.</p> <p>I'm proud that Labour MPs on the front and back benches are playing a great part. Honing the message and delivering the message.</p> <p>And on our 100th birthday, let's just pause to pay tribute to the thousands of ordinary everyday members of this party, who give so much to this party.</p> <p>This week during conference our organisers have been making 10,000 phone calls. The night of Tony's speech, the phones were red-hot with people wanting to join the party. I want them to be red-hot every day of the week.</p> <p>Only today, I joined up a new member - our newest recruit, Duncan Worthington. Take a bow! And it's his birthday today. He's 24 years old. </p> <p>He's an accountant. So he can help us work out the \u00a324m of Tory cuts in every constituency.</p> <p>Be confident. So I say to party members, be confident. Be proud. Walk tall.</p> <p>Get out there and tell people about what we have done. Tell them what we will do , with their support. Tell them what the Tories would do if they ever came back. And remember to ask people to join the party.</p> <p>Our solidarity is our strength. Operation turnout: every one of you was handed a leaflet like this today.</p> <p>It asks you to commit yourselves to help the party in campaigning. And to recruit a friend to the party.</p> <p>Well, I say to the people watching today - come and join us again. Rejoin the fight. Write to us. Come and join us. Because we've delivered, delivered, delivered.</p> <p>But the issue is turnout, turnout, turnout.</p> <p>Conference, everyone in this hall knows what is at stake. You know what we stand for. You know what we want to achieve. You know what we promised.</p> <p>Remember our pledge card? Here it is.</p> <p>We promised a quarter of a million places on the New Deal. And we are well on the way, with 230,000 young people in jobs to date. Real people in real jobs. Promise made, promise kept.</p> <p>We promised to cut NHS waiting lists by 100,000. And we have done. But we are doing something much bigger - rebuilding the NHS. It'll mean 20,000 extra nurses, 2,000 new doctors, real staff in real hospitals. Promise made, promise kept.</p> <p>We promised to reduce class sizes for five-to-seven-year-olds. We are doing that - were already a year ahead of schedule. Standards improving day by day. Promise made, promise kept.</p> <p>On crime, we promised fast track justice for young offenders; but we have also cut crime since the election. Promise made, promise kept.</p> <p>We promised a stable economy. But we did much more than that: we achieved something magnificent. Something people said was impossible. A million new jobs in the economy. Promise made, promise kept.</p> <p>Labour is delivering. So, we've got a simple message to tell. Labour has got the economy on a steady course; which meant taking some difficult decisions. Now we are investing in our public services - hospital, schools, police, transport.</p> <p>And what's the Tory alternative? I'll tell you - \u00a316bn of Tory spending cuts. \u00a324m of cuts in every constituency.</p> <p>So, when you get to Bournemouth next week, Mr Hague, come clean about the cuts. And to help you, today we are publishing a document which shows where these cuts will fall.</p> <p>We're giving copies to every delegate so you can go back to your constituency and prepare to splatter the Tories.</p> <p>So we will ask the \u00a324m question in every constituency in the country.</p> <p>I'll tell you what it means: 30 less doctors and 60 fewer nurses; 60 fewer police officers; a school axed in every single constituency; a hospital closed in every six local authorities; 760 nursery places; and free TV licences scrapped for over 4,000 pensioners.</p> <p>And that only gets you halfway to the \u00a324m cut in every constituency. You've seen this beer mat we produced in the summer. [produces beermat and pledge card]</p> <p>\"Tory froth\" or \"Labour delivery\". That's the choice facing Britain today. We'll go to the election posing that choice.</p> <p>Remember 18 years. The Tories will be at Bournemouth next week. We don't have to guess what they would do in government. We lived with it for 18 years. And we'll never let them forget what the Tories did to our country.</p> <p>Never forget the poll tax, 3m unemployed, the betrayal of our pensioners and the health service.</p> <p>Never forget the mad cow fiasco, the water bans, the privatisation fat cats. Never forget that 22 tax rises, inflation over 10%, mortgage rates of 15%. Negative equity and repossessions. </p> <p>Never forget cash for questions; Black Wednesday; the pit closures - the sheer injustice of those Tory years. </p> <p>Remember Mrs Thatcher in 1979, standing on the steps of No 10, saying: \"Where there is discord, may we bring harmony\"? </p> <p>The real truth is, where there was harmony, she brought discord. Where there was faith, she brought doubt. Where there was hope, she brought despair.</p> <p>We'll never ever forget, and we'll never ever forgive that betrayal.</p> <p>So I say to you all inside this hall, and the wider public beyond it - in our 100th year anniversary, we can be proud of what we've achieved.</p> <p>The 20th century saw many great advances in technology. The computer, the television, a man on the moon. Even the Jaguar motor car.</p> <p>But the greatest achievement of the Labour movement was to help shape the 20th century. To combat poverty, a welfare state. To combat squalor, social housing. To combat idleness, full employment. To combat ignorance, universal education. And at the heart of it all was the national health service - based on the socialist principle of treatment on the basis of need, not the ability to pay.</p> <p>Because we believe every person is of equal worth. We believe that we achieve more by the strength of our common endeavour than we achieve alone. We believe in opportunity for all, in a community where power, wealth and opportunity are in the hands of the many, not just the few.</p> <p>We civilised the 20th century with our democratic socialist values. Now our party is taking those values into the 21st century. Putting our traditional values in a modern setting. That's our crusade for social justice. Come and join us. </p> <p>So let's stand together, let's campaign together, let's work together. Together, build that better future for all.</p> <p>[After Gabrielle sings her hit Dreams to the conference, Mr Prescott introduces the former South African president Nelson Mandela.]</p> <p>I am about to welcome to conference a man who - with his courage, his strength, his charity, his dignity, his statesmanship and his humanity has won the hearts of the world.</p> <p>You know, we spent 18 years in opposition and we hated it.</p> <p>He spent 27 years in prison and he never for one second gave up faith or hope. </p> <p>Tony spoke of his irreducible core.

  "The west must do more to halt the spread of aids and global inequality, Nelson Mandela said in a closing address to the Labour party conference in Brighton today. <p>Mr Mandela, the first black president of South Africa, thanked the party for the support they gave to the anti-apartheid movement. But he warned that globalisation presented a new set of challenges for the world. He said that all human beings are beings are born equal and must be treated equally.</p> <p>The 82-year-old was greeted with a standing ovation as he walked to the stage with the prime minister, Tony Blair. </p> <p>John Prescott introduced Mr Mandela as an honorary Labour party member. The deputy prime minister reminded delegates that Mr Mandela had \"spent 27 years in prison - and never for one second gave up faith or hope.\"</p> <p>Mr Mandela told the Labour conference: \"Your solidarity helped to make those years of exile bearable and contributed to them not turning out to be wasted years. </p> <p>\"Apartheid was experienced as such a basic onslaught against human dignity that it demeaned all of us. One therefore has an appreciation for the support received from people all over the world, irrespective of their party political affiliation.\" </p> <p>The former South African president said that Labour's centenary celebrations served to remind him that the ideals and international solidarity that the party fought for in its first century need to be continued in its next. </p> <p>Turning to globalisation, he warned that there is a danger it will only mean the free flow of goods and finance, open access to markets, the breaking down of barriers to trade and commerce. </p> <p>\"The concern for the common good, which characterised the international solidarity we spoke of, is in danger of being lost in the current understanding of a global world,\" he said. </p> <p>\"We would argue that the shrinking of the globe through the advances in communications and information technology has made it even more incumbent upon us to become once more the keepers of our brothers and sisters wherever in the world. \"This may very well be one of the major political and moral tasks of the Labour party in the 21st century.\" </p> <p>Mr Mandela said that no country could avoid globalisation. \"Those who are saying they are not going to prepare for this phenomenon \u0085 [might as well say] 'I don't recognise winter, therefore I'm not going to buy clothing for winter'.\" </p> <p>To applause, Mr Mandela told Labour delegates: \"We have our reservations about globalisation. We must certainly not be afraid to condemn those aspects of globalisation which lead to more poverty in the world. </p> <p>\"We can no longer tolerate where few powers dominate the world ... All human beings are beings are born equal. They must be treated equally.\"</p> <p>Speaking of his own country, Mr Mandela said that South Africa needed more help to fight aids. Ten teachers were dying each month from the disease, Mr Mandela said; at one university it was killing a student a week; and in another, 25% were HIV positive. He said that in a neighbouring country three cabinet ministers had died from Aids.</p> <p>\"We look to our friends to assist us to stave off that crisis,\" Mr Mandela said.</p>",
  "One of the distinguishing features of the anti-apartheid struggle was the very broad support it enjoyed from most political persuasions in all parts of the world. <p>Apartheid was experienced as such a basic onslaught against human dignity that it demeaned all of us.</p> <p>The political parties in the major western countries often had different approaches in their support for the freedom struggle in South Africa, but none could ever condone the racism of apartheid. </p> <p>This universal abhorrence of apartheid contributed significantly to the ultimate victory of freedom, non-racialism and democracy in our country.</p> <p>One therefore has an appreciation for the support received from people all over the world, irrespective of their party political affiliation.</p> <p>There were however, political parties and organisations in the western democracies with which the liberation movement developed particularly strong solidarity relations.</p> <p>These derived from a common approach to such social issues as poverty and the primary concern for the marginalised. </p> <p>These relationships were built and consolidated in joint action and struggle with the solidarity forces in those countries.</p> <p>The Labour party of Great Britain is one such organisation. It therefore gives us such great pleasure to join with you here today at your party congress in the year that the party celebrates its centenary.</p> <p>Allow me in the first place to extend our hearty congratulations to the Labour party. I am certain that I can do so on behalf of all the freedom-loving people in our country, who appreciated the extent to which the attainment of democracy in South Africa was also due to our solidarity partners internationally. </p> <p>I know that I can do it on behalf of the organisation that you supported so faithfully over many decades, the African National Congress. </p> <p>Britain was in so many respects the second headquarters of our movement in exile. Your solidarity helped to make those years of exile bearable and contributed to them not turning out to be wasted years. With you we can look back to the proud beginnings of your organisation, rooted in the concern to give organisational voice to those without power. </p> <p>To have sustained over a century such an organisation is a tribute not only to the Labour party, its leadership and members. It is testimony to the resilience of the spirit that continues to believe that the world can be made a better place for all.</p> <p>It defies and gives the lie to the pervasive cynicism and loss of hope that characterised so much of political life in the latter part of the last century. </p> <p>The centenary celebrations of such a political organisation serves to remind us, here at the start of a new millennium, of the continued need to persevere in the pursuit of those ideals.</p> <p>The internationalism of which the Labour party was such a potent part, as we well know in South Africa, today faces new challenges.</p> <p>At a time international solidarity was a triumph of the human spirit over the barriers of distance and isolation. We marvelled at that generosity of spirit capable of reaching out to take part in the struggles of those far removed and in distant corners of the world.</p> <p>Today the world has become the global village of which we once spoke only in wishful metaphor. What happens in one part of the globe is immediately accessible to the entire world and affects others over great distances.</p> <p>The danger is that globalisation can come to mean only the free flow of goods and finance, the open access to markets, the breaking down of barriers to trade and commerce. </p> <p>The concern for the common good, which characterised the international solidarity we spoke of , is in danger of being lost in the current understanding of a global world.</p> <p>We would argue that the shrinking of the globe through the advances in communications and information technology has made it even more incumbent upon us to become once more the keepers of our brothers and sisters no matter where they find themselves in the world. This may very well be one of the major political and moral tasks of the Labour party in the 21st century.</p> <p>One can have these global expectations only of a party that domestically holds dear those values of solidarity with the poor and the vulnerable sectors of society. It is a sad fact of our times that in spite of the massive scientific, technological and economic advances humankind has made poverty and social inequality remain features of most societies in the world. Our historic relationship with the Labour party rests upon our common concern to centrally represent the voice and interests of those sectors traditionally excluded from power and privilege. </p> <p>In our own country poverty remains the greatest social problem and its eradication our greatest political and societal challenge. </p> <p>We have achieved a non-racial democracy based on one of the most progressive constitutions anywhere in the world. Our once divided society has come together in an act of national reconciliation that ensures that our political order is stable; we now live out our differences within the framework of our constitutional democracy. The management of our economy is widely acclaimed for the manner in which sound macro-economic fundamentals are maintained. </p> <p>The people-centred growth of our economy, with new jobs and increasing prosperity for all our people, has however not occurred at the pace and volume we hoped for when we set out on this road of reconstruction and development.</p> <p>The growth of an economy is no longer merely a national matter. Globalisation has exactly meant that a nation's best made plans can go awry due to international factors beyond its control. </p> <p>We have seen that with the financial crisis in the Asian markets, even though our economy withstood that crisis better than most of the emergent economies. The effective growth of an economy like ours is crucially dependent upon direct foreign investment; yet one often witnesses how the political stability, social progressiveness and sound economic management in the country are ignored when investment decisions are made. </p> <p>As we stood together to oppose apartheid in South Africa, we are today called upon to join forces for growth and development. </p> <p>Democratic South Africa has no pretensions to being a mini superpower in our region, on our continent or in the developing world. We do, however, realise that we have a responsibility to articulate common concerns of those regions when we do act on the international stage. In doing so, we turn once more to our traditional solidarity partners, like the Labour party, to add their voice to those clamouring and working for a better and more equitable life for all throughout the world. </p> <p>We wish you well as you enter the second century of your organisational life. </p> <p>The health of a democracy is ultimately dependent upon the vibrancy of its political parties and the active participation of the citizenry. It is our wish that the human solidarity that has inspired the Labour party for such a long time will be kept alive in action. May this century be one where the poor and marginalised come into their own and the gross social inequalities of the past at last are eradicated. </p> <p>I thank you.</p>",
  "<b>What has prompted the review? </b> <br> There has been widespread protest by civil rights and refugee aid groups. They say the voucher scheme is blatantly discriminatory, immoral and humiliating. Transport and General Workers' Union leader Bill Morris has campaigned vigorously against the vouchers, which he describes as \"inhuman\" and \"degrading\". <p><b>How much do asylum seekers 'scrounge' from taxpayers? </b><br> They get a maximum of \u00a310 a week in cash, plus vouchers in denominations ranging from 50p to \u00a310, to exchange for food and other necessities. At most, asylum seekers get aid in cash and kind amounting to 70% of the minimum income support offered to UK citizens. </p> <p><b>What does that mean for an individual? </b><br> Oxfam has a case study of a 20-year-old man who fled the Democratic Republic of Congo after being arrested and tortured. He is expected to survive on a weekly allowance of \u00a310 cash and \u00a328 in vouchers. </p> <p><b>How do the vouchers work? </b><br> They can be used only in shops and supermarkets which sign up to the scheme. Leading supermarket chains including Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda and Somerfield have all joined in. </p> <p><b>What do they get out of it? </b><br> The refugees are in effect a captive market, prevented from shopping around. Their contribution to the store's profit is guaranteed, as the government redeems the vouchers at face value. The icing on the cake is that the stores are not allowed to give change. So a refugee who buys, say, \u00a39.50 worth of goods with a \u00a310 voucher, is handing the store an extra 50p profit. Thus the supermarket chains are being subsidised, at the expense of some of the poorest people in the country. </p> <p><b>How does the government justify the vouchers? </b><br> The Home Office claims that because asylum seekers can receive the vouchers even while staying with friends and relatives, many are now accepting such offers of accommodation rather than be housed by the government. In consequence, the number having to be 'dispersed' to emergency housing around the country has declined from 64,000 to 38,000. </p> <p><b>What will be the effect of the new policy review? </b><br> Aid groups like the Refugee Council are hoping the vouchers will be scrapped. However, the government is being carefully noncommittal. There is no timetable let alone a deadline for the review body, which will start work \"very soon\". </p> <p><b>How many refugees are there in the world? </b><br> Approximately 33 million. </p> <p><b>And how many in Britain? </b><br> Approximately 0.5% of the global total.</p> <p><b>Useful links:</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Refugees_in_Britain\">Special report: Refugees in Britain</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.defend-asylum-seekers.freeserve.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Asylum Rights Campaign</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.actionforsolidarity.org.uk/factfile/asylumfacts.html\" target=\"_new\">Asylum myths demolished</a> <br> <a href=\"http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/aa_r/Asylum.html\" target=\"_new\">National Assembly Against Racism</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.homebeats.co.uk/resources/lessons.htm\" target=\"_new\">Institute of Race Relations</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.oxfam.org.uk/campaign/cutconflict/asylum/action.htm\" target=\"_new\">Oxfam on the voucher scheme</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.oxfam.org.uk/campaign/cutconflict/asylum/case.htm\" target=\"_new\">Asylum case studies from Oxfam</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.oxfam.org.uk/campaign/cutconflict/asylum/facts.htm\" target=\"_new\">Asylum statistics worldwide</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.unhcr.ch/\" target=\"_new\">United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.refugeecouncil.org.uk/\" target=\"_new\">The Refugee Council</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.tgwu.org.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Transport and General Workers Union</a></p>",
  "China yesterday stepped up its war of words with the Vatican about the coming canonisation of Catholic martyrs whom it said deserved to die. <p>A slow thaw in relations with the Holy See, the central administration for the Roman Catholic church worldwide, was abruptly reversed as Beijing mounted a last-minute campaign to stop Pope John Paul from making saints this Sunday of 120 western and Chinese Catholics who were killed in China between 1648 and 1930. </p> <p>Adding to Beijing's anger is the fact that Sunday is also China's national day, the anniversary of the date when the communists took power 51 years ago. </p> <p>\"This public humiliation and scorn for the Chinese people and Chinese church is something we absolutely cannot tolerate and accept,\" warned a statement from the Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association and the Chinese Catholics Bishops college, two government-run churches which Beijing uses to further its continuing feud with the Vatican. </p> <p>\"Some in the Holy See want to use this 'canonisation' to distort and slander history, renew control over China's Catholic church and encourage worshippers to oppose the government.\" </p> <p>The state-run media also publicised tough new restrictions that ban missionaries and bar foreigners from most kinds of religious activity within China. </p> <p>Beijing insists that the 87 Chinese and 33 missionaries who are to be made saints were either \"killed for bullying the Chinese people\" or \"executed for violating Chinese law during the invasion of China by imperialists and colonialists\", according to a foreign ministry spokesman, Sun Yuxi. </p> <p>Most died during the Boxer rebellion from 1898 to 1900, when bands of peasants slaughtered missionaries and their Chinese converts, prompting an invasion by British and other western armies. Beijing largely defends these killings by saying they were the precursor to the communists' own revolution. </p> <p>The Holy See has challenged Beijing to produce evidence that criminals were to be canonised. </p> <p>\"Let Beijing save their saliva,\" said Adolfo Yllana, the charge d'affaires at the Vatican's embassy in Taiwan, predicting that further Chinese saints would be named next year. \"There will be more to criticise soon.\" </p> <p>Beijing has no official ties with the Vatican, and bars it from having bishops or places of worships in China. But the Holy See says it has 10m secret followers who attend underground churches, despite a state-run rival church that requires worshippers to pledge allegiance to the government and claims to have 5m registered Catholics. </p> <p>Relations had been warming in recent years, with extensive unofficial contacts between the two sides, and China trying to persuade the Vatican to break its links with Taiwan; even during the present war of words the Holy See had sought to avoid escalating the conflict with Beijing. </p> <p>A Vatican spokesman, Joaquin Navarro-Valls, said that \"Sunday's ceremony has no political motivation\". </p> <p>He said the date was chosen to coincide with the feast of St Teresa of Lisieux, the patron saint of the missions, and that it was pure coincidence that it was also China's national day. </p> <p>In a further conciliatory gesture, no Catholics killed since the communists seized power in 1949 have been included in the list of those being canonised, even though religious persecution has been widespread in China throughout the past 50 years.</p>",
  "<b>Sunday</b> <p>\u0095 Letdown of the day was undoubtedly the weather. Conference-goers arrived to find Brighton station awash as the rain poured down. It continued all week.</p> <p>\u0095 Speech of the day was <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/labour2000/story/0,7369,372918,00.html\">Mo Mowlam's final address</a> to the party as an MP. Nominally about citizenship, it was really about her and delegates cheered \"Our Mo\" to the rafters. But - whisper it quietly - the speech developed into an unimpressive ramble. Even Neil Kinnock was overheard criticising it.</p> <p>\u0095 Two contenders for the title of party of the night: the New Statesman bash and the late-night Saatchi and Saatchi social. The latter wins for providing a Latin band and rum shots. Ministers danced into the small hours.</p> <p><b>Monday</b></p> <p>\u0095 After the fripperies of the day before, Labour's conference got down to business. No prizes for guessing the most important event of the day: <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/labour2000/story/0,7369,373460,00.html\">Gordon Brown's speech</a>. He set out a partial about turn on pensions but failed to stop them turning into the surprise issue of the week. Despite this the chancellor's powerful speech went a long way towards restoring his reputation, and New Labour's confidence.</p> <p>\u0095 Fringe meeting of the day was, of course, the <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0925gdndebate.rm\">lunchtime debate</a> - sponsored by the Guardian - on whether Labour had lost its roots.</p> <p>\u0095 Dome minister Lord Falconer tried his best to defend his project, but it was the rebel QC-turned-MP Bob Marshall-Andrews who won the loudest applause for laying into the government's mistakes.</p> <p>\u0095 Monday also saw the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/labour2000/story/0,7369,373124,00.html\">speak on transport and the environment</a>. His usual soapbox style puts some other cabinet ministers to shame, but Prezza's promises of free bus passes for pensioners and better public transport were upstaged by the chancellor's address later in the day. Equally overshadowed was Peter Mandelson's speech on Northern Ireland.</p> <p><b>Tuesday</b></p> <p>\u0095 Only one event really mattered at this year's conference: <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/labour2000/story/0,7369,373877,00.html\">the prime minister's speech</a>, which came on Tuesday afternoon. The next day's press splashed on Tony Blair's <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/labour2000/story/0,7369,373819,00.html\">sweat-soaked shirt</a>, but delegates were struck by Mr Blair's discovery of what he called his \"irreducible core\". At least he stands for something, they agreed.</p> <p>\u0095 Upstaged minister of the day was the foreign secretary, <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/labour2000/story/0,7369,373602,00.html\">Robin Cook</a>, but then his promise of an electronic hotline for British citizen's abroad was never likely to make the front pages.</p> <p><b>Wednesday</b></p> <p>\u0095 Theme of the day was \"why are we still here?\" as delegates and journalists pondered the reasons for staying another 48 hours after the prime minister had spoken. By the afternoon they had an answer as a surprisingly passionate debate on pensions saw <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/labour2000/story/0,7369,374355,00.html\">a rare defeat for the government</a>. Spin doctors' line: this shows the party isn't run by control freaks. Delegates' and unions' view: watch out Tony and Gordon, we're still here.</p> <p>\u0095 The pensions debate allowed the conference darling of the week, Lady Castle, to shine in a speech attacking the government.</p> <p>\u0095 Upstaged minister of the day: David Blunkett. His dull speech on education hardly packed the hall.</p> <p><b>Thursday</b></p> <p>\u0095 Only one thought on delegates' minds: going home. But first Nelson Mandela flies in from South Africa to join John Prescott. Question of the week: will he sing The Red Flag?</p> <p>\u0095 Upstaged ministers: Chris Smith, Stephen Byers and Nick Brown.</p>",

  "<p>Channel 4 has signed up to a new music sourcing system to save it time finding the right music for programmes.</p> <p>The system, called Startle, gives producers, librarians and broadcasters direct access to over 70,000 tracks of production music that they can research, audition, download and license via the internet.</p> <p> Instead of manually trawling through CD archives, Startle claims broadcasters could speed up the process by anything up to 20 times and make savings of up to \u00a35,000 per producer per year. The system is aimed at companies making TV programmes, films, adverts or those adding sounds to websites or games. </p> <p>While attention is focused on the global market for digital downloads of music, Startle claims the biggest difference will happen in the business to business market, which is currently worth \u00a320m in the UK alone. </p> <p>A Channel 4 spokesman said: \"It cuts search time down to a minimum, which is so vital in the time-pressured environment in which we work. The service gives us increased choice and a better quality of music.\"</p> <p>The Startle system is already used by a number of media firms including the BBC, Turner, TWI and IPC.</p>",
  "<p>News Corp, the sprawling media empire run by Rupert Murdoch, yesterday cemented its link with John Malone, a trailblazer of the US cable industry often characterised as one of the world's most powerful media figures. </p> <p>The company announced a series of transactions which will lift Mr Malone's stake in News Corp from 7% to 18%, underlining his status as the second largest shareholder in the business. The Murdoch family has a 30% stake in the media concern, which owns assets from filmmaker 20th Century Fox to the Times newspaper and pay-television business BSkyB. </p> <p>Mr Malone has also agreed to acquire $500m worth of shares in Sky Global Networks, the combination of News Corp's international satellite operations which has been earmarked for flotation. He will not be on the board of either company and his stakeholding in News Corp is non-voting. </p> <p>Under the broad outline of the deal, News Corp is acquiring the 21% stake held by Mr Malone's Liberty Media in Gemstar-TV Guide International, the provider of interactive programming guides and publisher of TV Guide magazine in the US. News Corp will add the stake to its existing 22% share in the business. </p> <p>\"We have enjoyed a long, productive and mutually beneficial relationship with Liberty Media and John Malone, one of the giants of the media industry,\" Mr Murdoch said. </p> <p>\"That John has chosen to be come our single largest non-voting equity owner is as strong an endorsement as we could get of our strategic direction and operational performance.\" </p> <p>Mr Malone was also in backslapping mode. </p> <p>\"Over the years we have developed an outstanding relationship with Rupert and his management team, and we continue to believe that News Corp is one of the best managed and best positioned global entertainment companies in the world,\" he said. </p> <p>Liberty is transferring 80% of its holding in Gemstar to News Corp in return for American depository receipts representing 486m News Corp non-voting shares. The other 20% will be injected into Sky Global Networks. </p> <p>Liberty is also swapping its interests in a number of companies operating under the umbrella of Sky Latin America to Sky Global Networks in return for an additional 4.8% of the new company. </p> <p>The relationship between Mr Murdoch and Mr Malone strengthens a labyrinthine network of interests uniting some of the world's largest media and telecoms groups. </p> <p>Mr Malone built the Denver cable company Tele-Communications before selling it to US telecoms group AT&amp;T last year for \u00a337bn. </p> <p>Liberty is still owned by AT&amp;T and has a wide set of interests including stakes in European cable companies UPC and Telewest. </p> <p>There has been speculation that the alliance would strengthen Mr Murdoch's hand in his ambition to acquire Hughes Electronics, which owns satellite business DirecTV, from General Motors. </p> <p>The business has been valued at $40bn but would add significant weight to Sky Global Networks. DirecTV has 8m subscribers in the US and Latin America.</p>",
  "The range of \"classical\" instruments is much the same now as it was 200 years ago; while the instruments of Beethoven's orchestra have continued to evolve, few others have joined them on the concert platform. Tommy Reilly, who has died aged 81, was fascinated by the potential of the harmonica, and became one of the handful of musicians to secure a place in the concert mainstream for an instrument from outside the existing club. <p>Igor Stravinsky commented, \"After hearing your interpretation of my Chanson Russe, I would be happy to let you play anything of mine\": many composers wanted to write for Reilly, and he enjoyed an outstanding career as a performer and composer for film, television and radio. </p> <p>Born in Guelph, Ontario, Tommy Reilly was the son of Captain James Reilly, to whom, as with military bandmasters down the years, \"crossover\" came as second nature - he conducted symphony orchestras, and founded not only one of Canada's earliest jazz bands, but also the Elmdale Harmonica Band, a prizewinner at the Canadian National Exhibition in Toronto in the early 1930s. The military musical environment is exceptional in that wind players often learn string instruments too: Tommy Reilly started learning the violin at the age of eight. </p> <p>In 1935, the family moved to England, where Reilly made his professional debut as a harmonica player a year later. While keeping up his violin studies, he toured the variety theatres of the continent. At the outbreak of the second world war in 1939, he was a student at the Leipzig Conservatoire. The Gestapo arrested him, and he spent the whole period of the war in prison camps in Germany, Poland and France. </p> <p>The discipline of classical string-playing and the time made available by enforced leisure gave Reilly both the framework and the space to unlock the full expressive range of the harmonica. As Richard Morrison wrote in the Times after the first performance of Paul Patterson's Harmonica Concerto in 1987, \"Reilly's determination to establish the 'highbrow' credentials of his solid silver instrument has been matched by his skill at coaxing lyrical, musicianly sounds from this most intractable of sources.\" </p> <p>In 1945, Reilly returned to Britain, where regular radio broadcasts in the late 1940s made him a household name, and work followed right across the musical spectrum. The first of 30 major concert works written for him was the concerto by Michael Spivakovsky, broadcast as part of the Festival of Britain in 1951. Others followed from composers such as Gordon Jacob, Vilem Tausky, George Martin, Robert Farnon and James Moody. Martin produced Reilly's first recordings, 78rpm discs on the Parlophone label, in 1951, and Farnon also wrote for Reilly in his film scores, as did Bernard Herrmann, Elmer Bernstein, Maurice Jarre, Jerry Goldsmith, Dimitri Tiomkin and Ron Goodwin (Those Magnificent Men In Their Flying Machines). </p> <p>Reilly's own contribution to music for film came with the 1959 movie version of The Navy Lark, and he also supplied the jaunty interludes to the long-running radio series. His many television credits included Dixon Of Dock Green, The Last Of The Summer Wine and The Singing Detective. </p> <p>Later recordings covered arrangements of virtually anything tuneful, from British folksongs and popular classics - works by Mendelssohn, Faur\u00e9, Walton, Grainger, Smetana and Borodin - to the main theme from John Barry's score for Midnight Cowboy (1969). He also consolidated his achievement as a concert artist with recordings of Vaughan Williams's Romance for harmonica, strings and piano, and the harmonica concertos by Heitor Villa-Lobos and Malcolm Arnold. </p> <p>In 1967, Reilly had the first silver concert harmonica made to his specification, and he wrote many tutors and studies for the instrument. An OBE for services to music in 1992 was followed by awards from fellow musicians - those of the Deutscher Harmonika-Verband and the British Association of Composers, Authors and Songwriters. Reilly's worldwide reputation as a teacher and the new artistic stature he had brought to his instrument were both recognised when he was asked to conduct a harmonica masterclass at the internationally renowned Dartington summer school in 1998. </p> <p>Tommy Reilly leaves his wife Eva, son David and two grandchildren. </p> <p><b> Larry Adler writes: </b><br> Tommy Reilly was a player for whom I had deep respect. He had a style of his own, immediately recognisable. I always wanted to play the Bach Double Violin Concerto with Tommy, but the opportunity never arose. There are many good mouth organists, most of them imitating either Tommy or me, but Tommy never needed to imitate anyone. He was unique, in a class by himself. I will miss his wonderful playing: he didn't even have a close second. </p> <p>Thomas (Tommy) Rundle Reilly, harmonica player, born August 21 1919; died September 25 2000</p>",
  "Nelson Mandela is to appear in a \u00a3200m advertising campaign for the United Nations' Children's Fund to be directed by Steven Spielberg. <p>The pair will collaborate on the project, which aims to push children's rights to the top of the agenda ahead of a UN report next year. </p> <p>The campaign will be run by the London-based advertising agency, TBWA, which won the account over M&amp;C Saatchi New York. </p> <p>A spokeswoman for Unicef in New York said that a deal was expected to be finalised next week. </p> <p>The campaign is intended to develop a coherent brand for Unicef, including an international campaign targeting corporations, governments and young people. </p> <p>It will aim to change attitudes among industry and government leaders. The organisation hopes to galvanise support from academic bodies, charities and industry for the project, which is known internally as the Global Movement for Children. </p> <p>At the time of TBWA's appointment in March, Corinne Wood, head of communications at Unicef, said: \"TBWA has demonstrated an acute understanding of the brief as well as an ability to challenge perspectives on children's issues and proven experience of repositioning global brands.\"</p>",
  "<p>IBM, the global computer corporation, will create some 2,000 jobs in Britain during the next two years. </p> <p>The new positions will primarily be in the consultancy division, which has bases across the country. </p> <p>Yesterday's announcement came as IBM announced two dedicated e-business centres - in London and Hampshire. </p> <p>The brightly painted units, said to aid inspiration, will see IBM's clients work with designers on e-business issues such as website design. </p> <p>Rob Lawrence, creative director of IBM UK, hopes the centres will stimulate interest in the internet. </p> <p>\"The initial dot.com bubble has already burst, creating a negative impression of e-business among members of the public,\" he said. </p> <p>\"It is now absolutely crucial for British companies to get their e-business strategies right the first time around, or the public will recoil from the concept altogether.\" </p> <p>Kevin Loosemore, chief executive of IBM UK, believes the centres will also help change the company's image. </p> <p>\"People still think it's just a hardware company but that's less than 50% of our business,\" he said. \"More than half is services such as consultancy and business integration.\" </p> <p>IBM's British centres follow similar units established across the US, including Washington and New York, as well as Paris, Hamburg, Milan, Tokyo and Sydney.</p>",
  "<p>America Online and Japan's NTT Docomo joined forced yesterday in a partnership that seems likely to dominate the fastest growing area of the internet, the wireless web. </p> <p>The union, which brings together the world's biggest internet provider and the leader in mobile communications technology, challenges European competitors such as Vodafone and Nokia that have been slow in closing the gap between wireless and fixed internet access. </p> <p>Cementing the alliance, which was announced in Tokyo yesterday, NTT Docomo will buy a 42.3% stake in AOL Japan for \u00a510.3bn (\u00a364m). </p> <p>The two companies will market each other's products and begin joint development of new technology and software to create portals, in competition with companies such as Yahoo, that can be accessed both by personal computers and mobile phones. </p> <p>\"We hope to converge our fixed and mobile internet services and spread them on a global scale,\" said the president of NTT Docomo, Keiji Tachikawa. </p> <p>No date has been set for the start of the joint service, which faces numerous technological hurdles. </p> <p>Analysts said that if those challenges were overcome the benefits to the two firms would be enormous. </p> <p>AOL, the world's most popular web portal with 24m subscribers, is a relatively old company by internet standards which has struggled to expand beyond the US and personal computers. </p> <p>The deal with NTT Docomo, which has become Japan's top mobile phone company since its establishment eight years ago, opens up new geographical and technological markets. </p> <p>Under the agreement AOL's Instant Messenger and AOL Mail will be provided to the 12m subscribers to NTT Docomo's popular i-mode service, which offers cheap and continuous access to the internet via mobile phones. AOL has fewer than half a million customers in Japan. </p> <p>In return, NTT Docomo will raise its profile in the US market and gain access to the wide array of English-language content offered through AOL. This benefit would increase if the planned merger between AOL and Time Warner goes ahead. </p> <p>The real gains are likely to come next year, when NTT Docomo plans a new high-speed cellphone service that will transmit data 200 times faster than now. This will allow downloading of music and images via phones and palmtop devices that are now only possible by PC. </p> <p>The Japanese company is believed to be almost two years ahead of its rivals in Europe in developing this third-generation mobile phone technology, but it lacks a global presence to exploit this head start. </p> <p>It has reportedly earmarked \u00a52 trillion to buy stakes in overseas companies. </p> <p>In the past year, it has entered into alliances with Hutchison Telephone, Hong Kong's biggest mobile phone firm, KPN Mobile of the Netherlands and Hutchison 3G UK Holdings. </p> <p>Analysts said that the deal with AOL would help NTT Docomo to find telecom partners in the US and Europe, bringing the wireless web closer to consumers in Britain. </p> <p>Bob Pittman, president of America Online, said the changes would be profound. \"Developing next-generation convergence technologies will make the Internet experience even more convenient, easy to use and central to people's everyday lives,\" he said. </p> <p>The alliance also heralds the emergence of Japanese companies on the global internet stage. </p> <p>Despite its reputation as a technological innovator, Japan was left behind by the explosive growth of the internet, partly because of a national aversion to English language PC keyboards.</p>",
  "<p>Sir Arthur C Clarke is exhausted. \"I've just done a video for Australian TV,\" he wheezes from his wheelchair. \"My executive secretary is away organising UN conferences. I can't speak to you for very long.\" He is dressed in a green sarong and a Hawaiian yachting shirt. He is not wearing any shoes. And he is about to go for his afternoon nap. </p> <p>The reason the world's most famous futurologist has, at 82, grudgingly agreed to do yet another interview (\"I'm fed up with them,\" he grumbles) is to promote the publication of his latest book, The Light of Other Days. It quickly emerges, though, that Clarke is already bored with this project. \"I've done three novels since then,\" he sighs, swivelling to check his inbox. Which is a shame, because this novel is not just good - but fun, capacious, and in parts brilliant. </p> <p>His home in central Colombo, Sri Lanka, is surrounded by a high wall and an electric fence. Sitting in the office, among three computers and a giant short-wave radio, Clarke explains that the \"ideas\" in the novel are all his. Most of it was actually written, though, by someone else - in this case Stephen Baxter, the 42-year-old doyen of modern British science fiction writing, and a Clarke fan. The two authors hammered out the text via a series of emails. But it was Clarke who came up with the WormCam, a time-viewing device which abolishes privacy, speculative biography and unsolved crime. </p> <p>The book, with its vision of a relentlessly voyeuristic society, includes a memorable sex scene on a bench in 2041AD Rome. Who wrote the sex bits, I wonder? \"I had an operation for prostate cancer 10 years ago,\" Clarke says. \"I haven't the slightest interest in sex. But you have to keep up with reality.\" </p> <p>Rupert Murdoch's HarperCollins publishes the novel next week. Its principal baddie is Himal Patterson, a megalomanic media tycoon who invents WormCams (which can link any point in space to any other) merely as a means of getting to the news the instant it happens. Clarke concedes that \"there are certain elements\" of Murdoch in the scheming Himal. </p> <p>Rupert and Arthur are good friends. The author of 2001: A Space Odyssey faced his trickiest moment three years ago, when he was turned over by the Sunday Mirror. It was Murdoch who wrote him a \"very nice\" note promising him that the reporters responsible would never work in Fleet Street again. \"He is a rather shy, modest person,\" Clarke says teasingly. \"I find him very deferential.\" </p> <p>The Mirror claimed that Clarke had paid young boys for sex. It produced affidavits from the boys in question. Sri Lankan police later disproved them, he says. The story ran two weeks before Prince Charles flew to Sri Lanka to confer a knighthood on the grand old man of science fiction. The saga was the lowest point in his career. At a banquet in his honour Clarke, who has post polio syndrome, found himself hobbling away from the press, pursued by an unctuous reporter from the Daily Telegraph. The episode still upsets him. \"I take an extremely dim view of people mucking about with boys,\" Clarke says. \"The whole thing was distressing to me. It was vindictive and very unpleasant. I can only assume it was a plot to embarrass Prince Charles.\" The novelist finally got his gong this May, at a low-key ceremony at the British high commission in Colombo. </p> <p>Clarke's private life remains a mystery. He was married briefly to an American, Marilyn Mayfield, now dead, whom he met while diving in Florida in the 50s. Asked whether he is gay, Clarke always gives the same puckish pro forma answer: \"No, merely cheerful.\" The answer, presumably, lies in the \"Clarkives\" - a vast collection of his manuscripts and private writings, to be published 50 years after his death. </p> <p>Like most brilliant obsessives Clarke was not, one suspects, an easy person to live with. His office is now a shrine to himself. There are photos of celebrities you would expect (astonaut Buzz Aldrin, Star Trek actorPatrick Stewart) and some you would not (Elizabeth Taylor). On the walls are photos of the moon and the Apollo landings. A vast bookshelf is devoted to his own works. Since growing up on a farm in Minehead in Somerset, Clarke has become exceedingly famous. He has written more than 80 novels, which have sold 50m copies. Back in 1945, aged 28, he wrote an essay for Wireless World in which he invented the concept of communications satellites. His celebrity reached a dizzy peak in the 50s and 60s, as the space age he had so confidently anticipated became a reality. </p> <p>And then there is 2001: A Space Odyssey, a Clarke story filmed in 1968 by Stanley Kubrick which transformed him into a household name. Did he think it would turn out like this? \"I never dreamed I would be reasonably successful. Writing was always an enjoyable hobby. If it made some money, good.\" His accent is still distinctly west country. Before trundling off for his afternoon sleep, he recounts how the greatest influences on his career were HG Wells and his half-forgotten contemporary, Olaf Stapleton. To his regret, he and Wells never met. In his early teens, Clarke - a precocious grammar school boy - would sit on a stool in his local WH Smith's reading War of the Worlds. \"I'm sure the kindly Smith's manager would have had to destroy the book afterwards because my hands were so dirty from the farm,\" he recalled. </p> <p>He devoured science fiction magazines and Arthur Conan Doyle's The Lost World (\"a classic of its kind\"). He also read Julius Caesar, Shakespeare's Sonnets, The Pickwick Papers, the Bible, the Georgian poets and AE Housman. He has still not got round to reading Hamlet. \"I have not read TS Eliot, still less Larkin,\" he adds. </p> <p>After leaving grammar school, Clarke got a job with the national audit office. By the time war arrived he was already writing technical papers - and his first science fiction short stories. When his civilian unit was evacuated to Colwyn Bay, north Wales, he was faced with the prospect of conscription; instead he joined a secret team of scientists working on radar. The days left plenty of time for writing. \"I was a devout coward. I was never in any danger. We were a long way from the action,\" he recalls. </p> <p>When the war ended he enrolled at King's College, London, taking a first in physics and maths. He summons one of his assistants to show me a 1947 photograph of his university year. The bespectacled Clarke is instantly recognisable: already balding, arms crossed, wearing a heavy suit and striped tie. Within five years he was an established writer. </p> <p>Clarke makes it clear when he has had enough of my company. He has to speak to Alastair Cooke later, he says. Most afternoons he also pops down to his club for a game of table tennis. He has lived in Sri Lanka since 1956, when he stopped off in what was then Ceylon on a diving holiday. He doesn't go out much these days and spends most of his time at the home he shares with Hector, his business partner. He is a surrogate grandfather to Hector's three daughters, Cherene, Tamara, and Melinda whom he describes as \"the apples of my eye\". </p> <p>Since the eldest two girls went away to study in Australia, Clarke admits things have been \"rather lonely\". He has seven staff - including an apolitical private secretary called Lenin - to deal with the fan mail and interview requests. He also has a pet chihuahua called Pepsi. \"I'm surprised you have not been attacked by my killer chihuahua,\" he says. It is an eccentric, affected, self-regarding, bachelor-ish existence, but then at 82 why not? </p> <p>Just before we say our farewells, Clarke reverses his wheelchair and heads back to his desk, with its three computers and giant Logitech mouse. He has to check his emails again. Most mornings, the novelist wakes to a groaningly large inbox, filled with messages from fans, friends, scientists, fellow authors, publicists and eccentrics. He is a compulsive emailer. Without Sir Arthur C Clarke, much of what the 20th century was about - the space race, moon landings, satellites, laptops, and even email itself - seems unthinkable. These days, though, in the context of a generation which has lost interest in space travel, one can't help thinking that the technology he has helped to create has in some way enslaved him. \"The last thing I wrote was a little squib of 500 words. It isn't easy to write because I spend so much time dealing with emails.\" And then he goes off to bed. </p> <p>The Light of Other Days is published by HarperCollins, price \u00a317.99.</p>",
  "The scientist at the centre of a missing embryo scandal may have lied about his work to cover up for mistakes, it was claimed last night. <p>Lawyers acting for four of the victims said it looked increasingly likely that women's embryos were never frozen despite patients being told by their IVF clinic this had been done.</p> <p>This suggestion was backed up by sources at the privately run Hampshire Clinic, where the bulk of victims come from.</p> <p>\"If this is so, then there has been a huge deception on behalf of one individual, the embryologist,\" said Catherine Hopkins, a clinical negligence specialist with the Basingstoke-based Penningtons solicitors.</p> <p>\"Women have been told their embryos had been mislaid but now it looks as though they were never kept in the first place.\"</p> <p>The harvesting of the eggs is carried out by a gynaecologist, who then hands them to an embryologist for storage, a trained scientist who has sole control of them until they are reintroduced after in vitro fertilisation.</p> <p>The embryologist checks the eggs for IVF suitability, and if there are more eggs than is needed for immediate use, the excess eggs are frozen. The embryologist then writes to the patient telling her that the remainder have been stored for future use.</p> <p>\"That person could complete the paperwork as required by human fertility and embryology authority legislation but may not actually have been skilful enough to complete the embryo storage process properly,\" said Ms Hopkins.</p> <p>\"If, due to the lack of skill of an individual, the embryo was damaged and rendered unsuitable for reimplantation, he may have tried to cover this up. We still don't know what happened.\"</p> <p>Lawyers believe the latest debacle suggested that there might be other areas where standards had fallen below those set by the HFEA.</p> <p>The risks were heightened if, as in this case, a single embryologist worked alone and unsupervised, as was particularly common in smaller, privately run clinics.</p> <p>The lawyers are now calling for a full government review of existing guidelines which allow a single embryologist to have sole control over the work, including the freezing and harvesting of embryos.</p> <p>Penningtons said they had been acting for one victim until it emerged this week that there was a much bigger problem.</p> <p>Tomorrow, they are meeting lawyers from the Hampshire Clinic and are hopeful of reaching a global settlement to compensate victims.</p> <p>In some cases, the loss may be far greater for some women such as those who are now too old or medically unable to try another embryo cycle.</p> <p>Last night a hospital source confirmed that the investigation was now focusing on whether Paul Fielding, an embryologist who both worked for North Hampshire hospitals NHS trust in Basingstoke and was contracted out to the Hampshire Clinic, had tried to cover up mistakes which led to embryos being destroyed.</p> <p>\"It may be that he was just not very good at the freezing process and destroyed the embryos.</p> <p>\"In a panic he may then have tried to cover his tracks with a false paperwork trail,\" the Hampshire Clinic source said.</p> <p>Richard Kennedy, an obstetrician and gynaecologist and secretary of the British Fertility Society and Centre for Reproductive Medicine, said that the freezing and storage of spare embryos had been carried out under strict guidelines laid down by by the Association of Clinical Embryologists and the human fertilisation and embryology authority.</p> <p>IVF therapy is now routine in the UK and approximately one third of all IVF treatments generate surplus embryos suitable for freezing, stortage and future replacement in one woman.</p> <p>This provides the couple with an additional opportunity for a pregnancy without having to repeat the expense and risks of ovarian egg stimulation.</p> <p>\"There are clear recommendations in how to run an IVF lab. If embryos go missing they are either stolen, which I have not heard of in this country, or the procedures had not been followed properly.</p> <p>\"This case is an absolute tragedy and my heart goes out to these women who thought they had embryos in storage and may have concerns about what embryos they have had replaced.\"</p> <p>Tim Hedgley, of the fertility charity Issue, which been counselling victims of the blunder, said that it understood the HFEA had audited the Hampshire Clinic for the past four years, since the time it started offering IVF treatment.</p> <p>He said that the charity was baffled as to why HFEA inspectors had failed to detect that embryos had been missing for four years.</p> <p>The health secretary, Alan Milburn, has asked the chief medical officer, Liam Donaldson, to prepare a report on the missing embryos.</p>",

  "\u0095 Larry Elliott writes (Inequity is higher on the agenda, September 27): \"There is no real evidence that the anti- globalisation protesters have succeeded\" in tapping into \"widespread discontent and offering a feasible alternative\" to the neo-liberal policies of the IMF and the World Bank. <p>I was one of 20,000 protesters from all corners of Europe who gathered in Prague to continue the worldwide challenge to these policies that began last November in Seattle. Most of us did not come to throw Molotov cocktails or trash McDonald's, but to assert our peaceful right to protest. This we succeeded in doing despite the Czech authorities' decision to ban all marches in the city. </p> <p>We have successfully forced the leading international capitalist institutions on to the defensive. Physically, they can only meet here in Prague behind barricades manned by riot police and soldiers equipped with armoured vehicles and water cannon. Ideologically, the IMF and the World Bank have been forced into desperate manoeuvres to camouflage the destructive effects of their policies. On Saturday I watched Walden Bello and other NGO representatives wipe the floor with James Wolfensohn of the World Bank and Horst Kohler of the IMF at a forum presided over by Vaclav Havel. </p> <p>Elliott quotes South African finance minister Trevor Manuel: \"I know what they [the protesters] are against, but I do not they what they are for.\" Mr Manuel is part of what we are against. His neo-liberal programme of privatisation and spending cuts has kept South Africa locked into the vice of economic stagnation and mass unemployment that the ANC inherited from apartheid. </p> <p>Many of us oppose not just these policies and the international institutions that enforce them. We are against the global capitalist system with its logic of competition and profit. We want an alternative socialist society based on the democratic control of the world's resources in or der to meet human needs in an environmentally sustainable way. Prague was another major step in building the movement that can achieve this alternative. <br><b>Alex Callinicos </b><br> Professor of politics, University of York <a href=\"mailto:atc1@york.ac.uk\">atc1@york.ac.uk</a> </p> <p> \u0095Larry Elliott perpetrates a cruel con trick when he advocates only the \"hard slog\" of persuasion in campaigning for an end to the gross inequalities in global wealth and power. </p> <p>We held a peaceful counter-conference and demonstration in Brighton on Sunday as part of the week of global anti-capitalist action in support of the Prague protests.

  "<p>At a large security software conference last week in Florida, the most popular T-shirt among the 1,000 delegates was the one you could get for free from the exhibition stand for a company called RSA Security. On the front of the black shirt was printed the RSA algorithm, the formula used to encode information in nearly all security software. Under the equation, the shirt read: \"It's just an algorithm.\" </p> <p>Except it really isn't, and never has been; and the shirt's popularity was a wry acknowledgement of this. For 17 years, the RSA algorithm has been the industry standard for so-called public key cryptography - a system whereby a person can encode and decode emails or other digital information by using special mathematical keys. One is a public key unique to an indi vidual that anyone can use to encode and send that person information, and one is a secret, private key, affiliated with the public key, which lets the individual alone decode it. </p> <p>Because RSA held the licence for the patented algorithm for its full US run of 17 years, many industry figures argue that RSA effectively controlled - and limited - the development of the security software industry. </p> <p>When the patent expired on September 6 (it was due to end on the 20th but RSA unexpectedly released it earlier), many senior industry figures were quick to issue biting comments. \"Over the past two decades the RSA patent and other public key patents did more to suppress the deployment of public key cryptography than the NSA (the US National Security Agency),\" said Phil Zimmer man, inventor of personal cryptography product Pretty Good Privacy, in a statement. \"As long as this patent was in effect, anyone who used it was a sharecropper on someone else's land. Now at last we can implement our own code.\" </p> <p>Among the loudest critics of RSA was the security software company holding last week's conference, an Irish firm,Baltimore Technologies. Baltimore, which had only six employees in 1996 , has stormed the security technologies market through a series of adept mergers and acquisitions - starting with British firm Zergo in 1998. </p> <p>To the surprise of most US analysts, Baltimore has now stepped into the number three spot in the tough US market behind Verisign and Entrust, and, with about 30% of the US market, is snapping at its two big rivals' heels. </p> <p>Baltimore claims that the way in which the patent was enforced hobbled the growth of the security industry and the adoption of public key cryptography, which has in turn shackled the growth of electronic commerce. \"I think patent bodies need to be a lot more careful,\" in deciding when to issue patents, Fran Rooney, Baltimore's CEO, said in a keynote speech, which took several swipes at RSA. </p> <p>According to Baltimore, RSA's high licence fees for the rights to use the patent, its system of charging companies additional royalties for products sold, and policy of forbidding non-US companies to sell any algorithm-based products into the US market made it costly for even large competitors to enter the security software industry. </p> <p>Rooney claimed that at one stage the restrictions threatened his business. While he believed companies deserved patents for unique technologies and should be able to charge \"reasonable\" fees for their use, \"no one should be able to put any restrictions on people being innovative\". </p> <p>One conference attendee who had headed a security division for a large European competitor had no doubt that RSA's licensing restrictions had been formidable for most non-US companies. His company had found the payments punishing, especially the additional royalty charge. </p> <p>Despite widespread grumbling among industry insiders, the patent's expiry has drawn little attention, and most delegates in Orlando appeared uninterested. \"There are other challenges,\" said one. The RSA employees staffing the stand shrugged off Rooney's speech. RSA Security is more interested in remaking itself as a security technologies company that can offer not just an algorithm, but \"the total solution\". </p> <p>Certainly, the whole sector faces enormous challenges in making PKI - public key infrastructure, a global system to support the use of public key cryptography - a reality. Most industry analysts agree that PKI will be the main system in the future, but a bickering industry, with different factions trying to create and own standards, has not advanced the cause. </p> <p>Speakers throughout the conference highlighted problems. A lack of hardware and software standards has limited the development of e-commerce over mobile phones and handheld devices. Interoperability is a huge issue. Smart cards, which seem to be gaining ground as a complementary technology for PKI, are little used in the US and hardware manufacturers aren't adding card readers to PCs and other devices. Many PKI programs are difficult to use. And the security industry has done little to inform either businesses or the public about PKI and its uses. </p> <p>Still, everything indicates that the net - probably delivered over mobiles or small devices - will be the central medium for transactions in the future, so the security software industry has everything to play for.</p>",
  "<p> 'Power to the people\" may not arouse much passion as a political slogan, but 25 years ago, the idea of \"computer power to the people\" helped start a revolution. Rather than being controlled by white-coated technocrats working for governments and giant corporations, computers should be available to everyone - which implied they must also be affordable and easy to use. </p> <p>It also implied that, if there was a market for market for personal computers, some people could have lots of fun and become very rich supplying them. Thousands of companies were founded to sell the new types of hardware and software the new industry required. Most promised far more than they could deliver, which is not uncommon with revolutions. Even so, it is impossible not to be impressed by the personal computer's growth in power and performance, and its market penetration. </p> <p>Today, PCs can be found in more than 50% of American homes - a far bigger proportion than any of the pioneers seriously believed. Where California's Silicon Valley has led the way, the rest of the world has followed. </p> <p>Intel made the revolution possible by designing the first microprocessor - a \"computer on a chip\" - in 1971, but it really started in Albuquerque, New Mexico. That is where a small company called Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems, MITS, run by Ed Roberts, made backyard model rockets and pocket calculators. MITS probably did not develop the first personal computer, but it put together the first hobbyist construction kit to capture the American imagination. It also came up with a catchy name, Altair 8800, derived from an episode of Star Trek. </p> <p>The MITS Altair helped set standards that encouraged the commercial use of personal computers, and some of them are still visible today. MITS used two products: an Intel 8080 chip, the ancestor of today's Pentium, and Digital Research's CP/M operating system, which could be used today by anyone familiar with MS DOS (Microsoft Disc Operating System). </p> <p>The Altair also ran a version of Basic (Beginners all-purpose symbolic instruction code) written by a teenager called Bill Gates and his friend Paul Allen. They were inspired to write it after seeing the Altair featured on the cover of Popular Electronics magazine. They moved to the Sundowner Motel in Albuquerque to be close to their only customer, with Gates dropping out of Harvard and Allen taking a job at MITS. There, in 1975, they co-founded Microsoft. </p> <p>MITS did not last long, but the Altair inspired dozens of companies to develop similar CP/M machines, most of which could share parts. These came to dominate the small business market for personal computers, but were not really suitable for domestic use. </p> <p>However, dozens more companies targeted home users with less expandable but better integrated machines. The main ones were the Apple II, Commodore PET (Personal Electronic Transactor) and Tandy TRS-80, all launched in 1977. </p> <p>In 1978, Science of Cambridge (later Sinclair Computers) launched the MK14 microcomputer kit for \u00a339.95 plus VAT, then the ZX80, ZX81, Spectrum and QL. In 1979, another Cambridge company, Acorn, launched the System 1 microcomputer kit for \u00a365 plus VAT, followed by the Atom, the Proton, the Electron, and the Archimedes. Actually, what would have been the Proton became much better known as the BBC Micro, announced in 1982. </p> <p> The BBC's adoption of the Acorn as the basis for a government-backed computer literacy programme shows what a grip the personal computer had already gained over the popular imagination. </p> <p>Unfortunately for Acorn, and dozens of similar start-ups, the future of the computer industry had already been decided. The microcomputer business had grown too big for IBM to ignore, and on August 18, 1981, it launched the IBM Personal Computer. </p> <p>IBM was by far the biggest computer company ever (with $87.5bn in annual sales, it still is) and part of its job was to set standards. That is what it did with the IBM PC. But for whatever reasons, including earlier failures, \"time to market\" and pressure from a long-running US government anti-trust case, IBM did not take its usual line of shipping a box with an IBM processor, an IBM operating system, and IBM-everything else. Instead, it based its PC on an Intel 8088 processor and Microsoft's MS-DOS operating system. It was, it turned out, handing its 40-year monopoly of corporate data processing to a couple of upstarts. </p> <p>In 1980, IBM had a turnover of $26bn and annual profits of $3.6bn, so perhaps it felt no need to fear a tiny company like Microsoft, which had only 40 staff. And while IBM realised that Microsoft and Intel would sell their stuff to all-comers, it perhaps didn't imagine that small, unknown companies would make better, faster IBM PC-compatibles and outsell the mighty IBM. But start-ups such as Compaq and Dell were soon on the way to doing exactly that. </p> <p>By setting a standard, IBM did the industry a service. Most personal computers produced up to that point had been incompatible with one another, even if they used the same chip. The Acorn BBC B, Apple II, Commodore 64 Atari 800,and others all used the MOS Technology 6502 processor, but software houses had to write a new version of their program for each machine. Given the cost and the time required, they often didn't bother, leaving these proprietary machines struggling for applications. By contrast, any PC program would run on machines from hundreds (later, thousands) of manufacturers. This helped propel the growing market for PCs and PC clones. </p> <p>The Altair 8800 and IBM's PC and PC AT (Advanced Technology) computers also led to a fundamental change in the way the industry was organised. Until then, the fashion had been for \"vertical integration\", with each manufacturer producing as much as possible in house. This could provide a better integrated system, but also created \"lock-in\": customers had few alternatives and could not easily \"defect\" to a rival supplier. </p> <p>Many early microcomputer firms, such as Apple and Commodore, followed this proprietary line.But they could not sustain the huge research and development required, and all struggled, were taken over, or went bust. </p> <p> By constrast, the PC market of the 1980s was based on \"horizontal integration\". Whatever PC you bought, it had an x86-compatible processor supplied by Intel, AMD, IBM, NEC or whoever, a version of DOS from Microsoft, IBM or Digital Research, and the manufacturer's choice of graphics card, hard drive, keyboard, memory, and screen. Choosing the \"best of breed\" created intense competition between parts suppliers, which led to rapid innovation, increased capabilities, and (usually) lower prices. </p> <p>Microsoft was in the thick of the competition in two areas. First, there was the need to replace DOS with a more powerful multi-tasking operating system (one that could do more than one thing at once). Second, there was the long-term aim of introducing a mouse-driven graphical user interface, to make computers easier to use. This had been part of the dream since 1968, when Doug Engelbart of the Stanford Research Institute demonstrated the first mouse, and it continued in the 70s at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Centre (Parc). Xerox's work provided the inspiration for Apple's Lisa and Macintosh computers, Microsoft's Windows, and Digital Research's GEM (Graphical Environment Manager) interface, which also appeared on the Atari ST home computer. </p> <p>In the 1970s, Xerox Parc was a decade ahead of the rest of the world, with its graphical interfaces and networks of personal computers connected to laser printers, which it sometimes showed off to visitors such as Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. But while it did launch some products, such as the Xerox Star 8010 in May 1981, they were expensive and never achieved commercial success. Instead of making Xerox rich, Parc's ideas enriched the industry, as firms such as Apple and Microsoft hired away their staff. </p> <p>At first, Microsoft had seen AT&amp;T's Unix as the obvious replacement for DOS, and announced its own version, Xenix. But while powerful, Unix was notoriously hard to use, and required more power than most PC users could afford. It also came in too many incompatible \"flavours\", of which Xenix was merely one. In 1987, Microsoft and IBM combined to launch OS/2 as a DOS replacement. However, since it didn't control the market and couldn't control IBM, Microsoft also wanted to hedge its bets. It didn't abandon Windows, and it opportunistically hired a group of defectors from Digital Equipment to write another DOS/Unix replacement, which appeared as Windows NT (New Technology). </p> <p>Some saw Microsoft's actions as treachery. Others recognised that IBM was trying to wrest back its control of the industry from Microsoft, Intel, Compaq and the rest. This plan revolved around OS/2 (later transferred to IBM's sole ownership), a proprietary MCA (Micro Channel Architecture) expansion bus, and Systems Application Architecture - a schema designed to tie IBM's Personal Systems (PS/2) to large IBM minicomputer and mainframe systems. Compaq formed a \"Gang of Nine\" to support a plausible alternative future, and IBM's plan failed. </p> <p>Next, IBM formed an alliance with Apple, which adopted IBM's PowerPC chip. They were still the two biggest personal computer suppliers in the US, and thought they could take on Intel. They were wrong, and later, Apple bottled out of the plan to move to a common hardware reference platform (CHRP) agreed between IBM, Apple, and Motorola. IBM then abandoned the launch of its own Power Personal Systems. </p> <p>The balance of power had already tipped Wintel's way in 1990, when Microsoft shipped Windows 3.0. Unlike OS/2, it was cheap, and easy to adopt. Users could even buy graphical applications such as Microsoft Word for Windows and the Excel spreadsheet (both first developed for the Apple Macintosh) and Corel Draw. </p> <p>At the time, Microsoft's turnover was only $1bn a year while IBM's was $67bn, so Big Blue was not about to admit defeat. It pumped vast amounts of cash into OS/2, promoting it as \"a better Windows than Windows\", until the stunning success of Microsoft Windows 95 sealed its fate. From that point on, Microsoft was clearly the computer industry's top dog, and sales of Windows-based PCs exploded. Microsoft's turnover grew from $1bn to $23bn during the decade, despite the continuous attentions of the Federal Trade Commission and the US Justice Department. </p> <p>Their investigations culminated in a trial in which Microsoft's business practices were comprehensively damned, leading Justice Penfied Jackson to order the break-up of the company - a decision now pending appeal. </p> <p>What is interesting is that, during the 1990s, despite its monopoly power, Microsoft was no more able to replace the DOS-Windows combination than anybody else. </p> <p>The Windows NT operating system, introduced in 1993, was supposed to do it. NT was designed to run on a range of different processors (Intel, Mips, DEC Alpha, PowerPC), to use more than one processor at once, and to offer the reliability and stability of rivals such as OS/2 and Unix. Despite various inducements, such as letting companies install NT for the same price as Windows 95, sales struggled. Three times, Microsoft has announced that the latest version of DOS-Windows (Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows Me) would be the last of the line, giving users little choice about moving to NT (now called Windows 2000). So far, it has not made it stick. </p> <p>Apple Macintosh users have been equally conservative, declining to move to technically superior systems such as Steve Jobs's NeXT or Be's BeOS, launched on the dual-processor BeBox. It remains to be seen if Jobs, the Apple co-founder who retuned to the company at the end of 1977, can shift them to an updated version of NeXT's Unix-based operating system, Mac OS X (see page 12 for a review of this system). </p> <p>That's the problem with revolutions: they may be exciting, but most users prefer evolution. They don't what to risk losing what they have in some great leap into the unknown. The result may be boring, but it is a sign of the personal computer's success that what started as a revolution has become the status quo. </p> <p> Which is not to say that progress has stopped. It has, rather, moved to handheld devices such as electronic organisers and mobile phones, to sealed-box \"appliances\" such as WebTV sets and games consoles, and most importantly, to the internet. And as the growth of the personal computer market has slowed, many PC companies - including Intel and Microsoft - have invested heavily in these new areas in search of the Next Big Thing. </p> <p>For a couple of decades, Microsoft's mission statement summed up the ambition of the PC industry: to put a computer on every desk and in every home. </p> <p>That has been changed to take in every type of device used anywhere at any time. The only argument is about whether we are entering the \"Post PC\" era, as some pundits claim, or the \"PC Plus\" era of Microsoft's new .Net (dot.net) vision, where the net, rather than the PC, is the software platform. </p> <p>Whatever happens, I expect companies raised in an industry based on rapid innovation and cut-throat competition will adapt and survive. Old and slow minicomputer and mainframe companies were generally unable to live with PC-based competitors, and old and slow consumer electronics and telecoms companies may be in for a big surprise. </p> <p><strong> Twenty five years of personal computing</strong></p> <p> <strong> 1975</strong> </p> <p> MITS Altair 8800 </p> <p>Microsoft Basic </p> <p> <strong> 1977</strong> </p> <p> Apple II </p> <p>Commodore PET </p> <p>Tandy TRS-80 </p> <p> <strong> 1980</strong> </p> <p> Sinclair ZX80 </p> <p> <strong> 1981</strong> </p> <p> IBM Personal Computer </p> <p>Microsoft MS-DOS </p> <p> <strong> 1982</strong> </p> <p> Acorn BBC B </p> <p>Commodore 64 </p> <p> <strong> 1984</strong> </p> <p> Apple Macintosh </p> <p>IBM PC AT </p> <p> Atari ST </p> <p>Commodore Amiga </p> <p> <strong> 1987</strong> </p> <p> IBM PS/2 and OS/2 </p> <p> <strong> 1988</strong> </p> <p> NeXT Cube </p> <p> <strong> 1990</strong> </p> <p> Microsoft Windows 3 </p> <p> <strong> 1991</strong> </p> <p> Apple-IBM deal </p> <p> <strong> 1993</strong> </p> <p> Intel Pentium </p> <p>Microsoft Windows NT </p> <p> <strong> 1994</strong> </p> <p> Apple Power Macs </p> <p>IBM OS/2 Warp 3 </p> <p> <strong> 1995</strong> </p> <p> Microsoft Windows 95 </p> <p> <strong> 1997</strong> </p> <p> Apple buys NeXT </p> <p> <strong> 2000</strong> </p> <p> Microsoft.net announced </p> <p>Apple OS X</p>",
  "<p><strong> How important is the net to Nasa?</strong> For our primary audience,US taxpayers, the net offers us a vast podium to explain how we're spending their money, why we think it's important, and what they're getting for it. We have well over a million public web pages on everything from the spaceshuttle to biology experiments. Instead of having to rely on the media for a 30-second TV story or one photograph from a Mars mission, the public can come to the Nasa web and find as much information as they would care to digest. </p> <p><strong> Is the net still exciting? </strong> I can't imagine any area I'd rather be working in. Development is always more fun than maintenance but both are essential. New technologies seem to be coming faster than ever, demanding that we adjust our net strategy to accommodate them. At Nasa, we have to address wireless technology, the convergence of the net and TV, and the improvement of our web offerings to provide more interactivity. We have to streamline and automate our maintenance to the greatest extent possible so that we can focus on improving our offerings. But even the part of the net that has become furniture is still very cool furniture. </p> <p><strong> Is an overhaul of the net's infrastructure long overdue?</strong> \"Overdue\" is a judgment, given that somebody's got to pay for the overhaul and, no matter how much the infrastructure is updated, it will start becoming obsolete as soon as it's completed. Still, until high-speed infrastructure is widely available, the web will remain limited in its offerings. We have to make it faster. Terabyte Ethernet to the desktop. Only then can we move beyond simple text and pictures and start making use of the real interactive possibilities. </p> <p><strong> Is technology catching up with our imaginations? </strong> I believe it is, if only because tomorrow's innovation is today's daydream. Only 40 years ago, \"global communications\" referred to a telephone cable at the bottom of the Atlantic. Now people in industrialised nations can reach almost anyone at any time, over cell phones that look suspiciously like Star Trek communicators. Whether that's a good thing or not is a different question! </p> <p><strong> Any favourite websites?</strong> This is where I lose all of my cutting-edge credentials. When people ask, \"Have you checked out thus-and-such cool web site?\", my answer is almost invariably, \"Hadn't heard about it.\" Then I visit it and feel completely behind the curve.
