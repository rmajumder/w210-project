  "<p>'So who is he?' Jeremy grunted later. </p> <p> Maria was pouring tea, really quite sweetly: proper tea, proper pot. </p> <p> 'Who's who?' </p> <p> 'This ... Max - what was it? Bannister character.' </p> <p> 'Oh - you don't really want to know.' </p> <p> 'I wouldn't have asked.' </p> <p> 'He's just ... someone.' </p> <p> 'Just someone. Uh huh. And me? I'm just someone too, am I?' </p> <p> Maria smiled. 'You're Jeremy.' </p> <p> And Jeremy smiled too - partly because when she did, you just had to, but also by way of gentlemanly concession of yet another small defeat in another little battle that, oddly, no one had waged. It was just that ... oh God - this was far from being the first of these circuitous and utterly pointless exchanges: Maria could have chattered on like this for the rest of the night, and still by dawn you'd end up with nothing. Maybe give it just one more go. I don't know, though. It was that brief and fleeting mention of dawn, just there (and look at the curtains: I can make out their colour). What will Anne say? Worse: what is it that I'll end up telling her? OK, then - one more go. What's to lose? (I'm lost already.) </p> <p> 'So then - this Max person. He's your, what - bloke, is he?' </p> <p> 'What a ghastly word: bloke.' </p> <p> 'But he is, is he? And he's Hugo's boss - did I get that right?' </p> <p> 'Not any more he isn't. Sacked him. Told you.' </p> <p> 'Why did you do that to Hugo? You could have broken his -' </p> <p> 'I didn't break anything. People like Hugo expect it. Are you staying?' </p> <p> Well? Am I? Well I am, yes, in that I've been putting off getting home for as long as I possibly can - and yet, oh God, the longer I leave it ... </p> <p> 'Depends. What are we doing, Maria? What do you want of me? What are we going to do about this thing?' </p> <p> 'You know what I want of you, Jeremy. You know exactly what.' </p> <p> 'And Max?' </p> <p>'Oh God do stop going on about him, can't you? Max is just Max, OK? And you're you. That's enough, isn't it?' </p> <p> 'Well no, not really - not at all, in fact. Look, Maria - we've got to get something straight: I'm married, and -' </p> <p> 'Marsha.' </p> <p> 'What?!' 'Some days I like my real name better - today is one of those.' </p> <p> 'Yeh? Well you're going to be Maria, OK? Change name once more and I'll go crazy. Oh Christ - I've completely forgotten what I was saying now ...' </p> <p> 'Don't say anything. Just hold me tight.' </p> <p> 'Maria ...!' </p> <p> 'Just hold me. You know you want to.' </p> <p> 'I do want to, I do - but ... God, you know, Maria - I know it sounds a bit of a ... well, clich*, I suppose - you see it in films, all this, don't you? These scenes. But I feel as if I've known you for ... as if I will know you for ...' </p> <p> 'Ever. I know. Hold me.' </p> <p> 'I have to go. I have to think. There's Anne to think of ... don't you want to know anything about me? About her? And there are children - I have two. I can't hurt them - can't ever bear to hurt them.' </p> <p> 'I'm not asking you to hurt them. I'm asking you to hold me. Hold me.' </p> <p> 'Maria - please -!' </p> <p> 'Shall we go back to bed? Do you want to?' </p> <p> 'I have to go. Of course I want to!' </p> <p> 'Well come on, then. Come on. Come to bed and hold me tight.' </p> <p> 'Oh God.' </p> <p> 'Come on ...' </p> <p> 'OK, OK - all right. And then, and then - I really have to go. OK? Yes, Maria? Say yes. I leave at nine - OK? Yes? At nine sharp, I am definitely leaving.' </p> <p> But I didn't. </p> <p> Did, eventually. Eventually Jeremy did manage to peel himself away from that girl and her things. It had taken, the whole process, just about for ever because listen: first, as soon as one of Maria's cool and soothing hands had reluctantly left him, the fingers of the other would maybe snake over a shoulder, or slide into one of his - could cup his jaw or tease those stiffly electrified hairs at the back of his neck; and second ... well, second: he just didn't want to go. But then as soon as he had actually done it (I am out, yes out of there - down those stairs, away from the warm and back in the street) and conducted a rapid roll-call of not just his parts but also the state of them - then so did he feel more chilled and alone than ever he could recall; and not as he first thought by the dread of going on home - facing what had to be faced there, no - but by the very emptiness that gapingly filled him. He blinked in the consciousness of knowing that being without Maria just simply had no point: it felt all wrong and it had no point. And yet before the party that he nearly didn't go to, he had not even known she had ever been born. But everything, all of it, seemed different now. </p> <p> Better get home to Anne and the kids: hear firsthand what it is I'm going to say. (How can it be that this girl has got me? It's not as if she's even very nice.) </p> <p> * * * </p> <p> 'Christ, you know,' laughed Max, 'I really do think Hugo must have lost his bleeding mind. You listening, Feebs? Says you said I'd chucked him from the company - something - and then you upped and clocked him with a bottle! Didn't think you was even going to that bash - why did you?' </p> <p> 'Because I was bored. Wasn't going to. And then I did. Because big shot Max Bannister was working again - remember? Anyway - just can't stand that creep. What did you say to him?' </p> <p> 'Didn't get much of a chance to say anything to him, did I? Bloke marches in, first thing this morning - looking bleeding rough, I gotta say -' </p> <p> 'Oh shit ...' </p> <p> 'What?' </p> <p> 'Spilt drink. Doesn't matter. Go on.' </p> <p> 'Always spilling something, aren't you, Feebs?' </p> <p> 'Oh Christ sake don't keep calling me that. I keep on telling you Marsha. Anyway - spilling you, soon.' </p> <p> 'What? What say? Spilling what? And you can fuck off with your bleeding Marsha caper, baby - I call you Feebs cos it's your sodding name, isn't it? Phoebe? Isn't it?' </p> <p> 'Max. I just don't want to talk to you any more. Kay? Just don't want to. Don't want you to be here.' </p> <p> 'Charmed. Anyway - off soon. Meeting. So - you give Hugo a smacking or didn't you?' </p> <p> 'What did he say to you? And you don't seem to get me, Max - I mean I don't want you around.' </p> <p> 'Yeh - you said. Bleeding polite. No - what he said to me was - barged right in, like I say, and he says OK Max You Bastard - nice, ay? OK, Max you bastard, he says - I've got the fucking truth, you bloody bastard - so now I'm really warming to the guy, aren't I? So I start in with Hey Hey Hey - don't know what the fuck you're talking about, do I? And he goes Oh Yeah Like Hell - she told me the lot. Anyway, he says - and he's really worked up now, telling you: veins standing out on him - anyway, he goes - what you can do is you can stuff your crap bloody job where the stars don't twinkle, mate - you're not sacking me, you bastard, cos I'm out of here. Amazing or what? And I'm like going, excuse me? Didn't know what the prat was on about, did I? So he's really kicking into me now, you know - so I just bloody let him have it: Hugo, I said, I don't know who's been telling you what, and I don't much care about whether you think you're junked or tendering your thing - resignation, right? But you're dead on the money on one score, my friend - you're fucking out the door, that's for bleeding sure. Should've seen his face!' </p> <p> 'So he's gone?' </p> <p> 'Not many. Too right. Then he starts going for me physical! Soon put paid to that little caper. Ow ow ow, he goes - once I'd dotted his bloody i's for him, cheeky sod. And he's, like - first your bird fucking brains me with a bottle, now you've gone and broken my bloody nose! Ha ha. Gotta laugh. Prat.' </p> <p> 'Yeah he is. He tried it on with me one time, you know.' </p> <p> 'Yeah? Bastard. Should've told. Would've done for him, period.' </p> <p> 'Yeh well. He's out now. And so are you, Max, by the way. So are you. Not so much big time as all the way, yeah?' </p> <p> 'What you on about, now, darling? I own the bloody company, don't I? Ay? So what you talking about now, then, Feebs?' </p> <p> 'I mean, Max, you're out of my life. From last night. When you wouldn't even come to a party. Again.' </p> <p> 'What's ... this? You joking or what, Phoebe?' </p> <p> 'Marsha, you bastard! No, Max. No joke. I don't - do I?' </p> <p> 'Phoebe - Marsha, honey: talk to me. What's got into you, hey? Not like you to do all this on me. Not your number.' </p> <p> 'I do all this when it's over. Haven't you got a meeting to go to, Max?' </p> <p> 'Hm? Oh fuck it - meeting can wait. Listen, Feebs -' </p> <p> 'They never waited for you before, though, did they, Max? Your bloody day and night endless important meetings. Hm? And if you call me that just one more time I walk right now and that's the end of me, I'm telling you.' </p> <p> 'You're ... not kidding me, are you, love?' </p> <p> 'Got it. Not.' </p> <p> 'But listen - hey: lisssen - you and me, we're all right! We're OK, us. Look, let's go and have a spot of - let's go over to Sophie's ... you like it there, yeh? Give ourselves a really boozy lunch, ay? Ay? How about it? Then we come home and I'll change your mind. Press all the right buttons. Sound good?' </p> <p> 'Sounds ... laughable. Laughable, Max. Understand: I'm not telling you I want more attention - I used to, all the time I used to, but now I just don't. Want any. Want out. Too late. I'm not saying Hey - let's talk it over - no, Max, I'm not. I'm simply informing you that it has ceased. As from last night.' </p> <p> 'As from last night ... Just like that. Ceased.' </p> <p> 'Correct. So why don't you go to your meeting, hm? And then when it's over - well then you'll know that we are too.' </p> <p> 'Look ... Marsha, love ...' </p> <p> 'Bye, Max. Some of it was nice.' </p> <p> 'Don't ... leave me, baby. Don't just walk.' </p> <p> 'Bye. I won't say See You.' </p> <p> 'Here - you got another bloke or what, you bitch?' </p> <p> 'Yeah.' </p> <p> 'Yeah! Yeah! What you fucking mean - yeah?! Since bloody when, you slag?' </p> <p> 'As from last night. Told you.' </p> <p> 'As from ... Christ, it's not fucking Hugo, is it?' </p> <p> 'Oh God, Max - you just don't see anything.' 'Yeah? Oh yeah? Well let me just tell you, you cunt - I see this - I see this - I see bloody you for exactly what you bloody are, you ... you -' </p> <p> 'I go now.' </p> <p> 'So who is he? Hey? Who is he, this Mister Bleeding Wonderful? What's so fucking great about him, hey? He got money? Who is he? What does he do?!' </p> <p> 'What he does, Max, is he calls me Maria - which is one step further on. This is what I need and all I want, just now. It's not important if you don't understand.' </p> <p> Maria turned and easily walked away. Max bloody knew he - Christ yes - had one helluva lot more than this to hit the cow with, but found himself caught up and dumbed by the sidle of her hips, and the long legs idling away from them. His mouth was still wide open and silent as the door kissed shut quite softly behind her. </p> <p>* * * </p> <p>And then I just did, then, did I? Go home? Jeremy had often wondered at this from the distant vantage point of what could never, even then, be thought of as anything ever close to a haven, no - simply later on, is all. Time helps. Helped me along, anyway - until it comes full circle and turns and confronts you and trips you up just one more time, it can generally be relied on to do that thing people always assure you it will: heal - or anyway make it blunter and hurt less. But when you are actually in the midst of a spotlit scene that's ticking away, ticking away - even if it's horrible (and that episode with Anne, the one I'm thinking of that time when I went home the next day, God it was - it was horrible, that) - everything seems so utterly natural, no matter how strange: completely unalterable, like the lie of the down as it glistens on your forearm. What is good, though, is that after seemingly ages (but maybe only just long enough) every prickled and all-too-see-through hair begins to bunch up and thicken, before blurring into fur and softening the worst of it: a protection of sorts, and one needs and hugs it. But as you play your part, second by second in the here and now - ah well then, then there can be no defence at all, not then: you're out there, stark and alone - knowing it's real, though barely believing it can be. </p> <p> And it just had to be a Saturday, didn't it? Adrian and Donna - not at school: doesn't exactly help, does it? Well - didn't matter awfully much in Donna's case, if I'm being quite frank here. She was five then, just on - and I don't know if it's just with little girls (always more difficult with Adrian) but I always found that if you just smile in their direction and keep on fishing out treat after treat from your secret store of goodies, they just about swallow down anything, some kids - though that glint of doubt shows me clearly that they don't wholly trust themselves for doing so, let alone you, for needing their collaboration. </p> <p> Adrian, though - different, quite different. Thirteen he was then, pretty close (very close, in point of fact, because his birthday was due, I will always remember, on the Thursday of the following week - wasn't there for it: gone by then). And he's always seemed older than his years, has Adrian - always regarded him with an air of awe, maybe respect (and sometimes, inexplicably, even fear: my very own son - odd or what?). And yes, I well know that the gap between the two kids was seen to be a long one - nearly eight years, yes that's long - used even to joke about it in the old (old) days: Waaaal, I'd drawl - you get so tired, don't you, ay? Started off as a joke, anyway (don't things, often?), but soon it had become uncomfortably close to the heart of the matter: just ask Anne. No - don't bother: she'll tell you herself - she is, I'm told, unstoppable now. She'll say to you something like (I can well imagine) - Oh Jeremy, poor Jeremy - had a permanent migraine, poor darling; well - not permanent permanent: lasted from when I joined him in bed at night-time until he bounded up and out in the morning, eager to be simply anywhere else at all! Something, I should think, on those lines. And she had a point, be fair. It's not that I found her unattractive, as such - it was just that she was, well - Anne, if you see what I'm saying. And mother to Adrian and Donna. And God, they both of them - facially, you know - are so much like her it's weird, I'm telling you. Particularly Adrian. The looks he sometimes gives you - like that one that kissed me full in the face and shamingly dead centre when I did eventually get home that first morning after that first night with Maria (no hint of migraine then, I recall: came like a train - came again like another one). And look at Anne, now - just look at her, will you? Same expression as the boy - same exactly. Same face, you see: same accusatory and heavy-veiled eyes - and yes, almost certainly, same dark thoughts lurking behind them (leaving suspicion way behind, and closing in fast on outright condemnation). </p> <p> I lit a last cigarette - exhaling, I thought reasonably coolly. I never did smoke heavily, but without knowing it, I was poised on giving them up completely - that very hour and quite without trying (along with so much else - all, indeed, I ever had). Anne was fiercely grinding down a lemon half on the Juicy Salif - that jaunty and gunmetal squeezer - something, I know it sounds silly, I had asked her never to do. I'm odd, I think, among my fellow designers in that I always feel that these beautiful objects are best left alone - whatever their function: chairs or shelves, vases and bowls - even lamps and bottles, sometimes. Don't make them work, is what I'm thinking: why don't you just let them be? Not Anne. Not only would she sprawl all over the Charles Eames lounger, or recklessly nudge Corbusier's masterpiece, the chrome and leather Grand Confort, hopelessly out of square - she'd even deck them with newspapers and, oh God - cushions. This hurt me - and I don't really care how that comes over. And yes of course I now see that this is maybe - not maybe - just why she did it. Any other time and my opening line could well have been, Anne - Anne? Listen to me, Anne: I've told you, what - how many times is it now? We've got other squeezers, haven't we? Hm? We even bought that electric juicer. So why the Starck? Hey? Tell me please. Of all the gadgets, why the one that's just perfect in repose? Yes - I did, with Anne, find myself sounding quite as arch as that, and sometimes a good deal more so. Only with Anne, I think (and ever-increasingly, I now see, towards what I didn't really know would be the end). But with four hard eyes, now, burning right into me (and Donna would not be long in catching up) that is not what I thought I should say. What would have come, I couldn't tell you (I remember an almost hysterical giddiness, something approaching a mad excitement - so eager was I still to be first to hear just exactly what it was I might go for) - because it was Anne, tossing the lemon rind almost into my gleaming Brabantia wastebin (the chromework now streaky, I just had to observe) - who looked up and nearly at me and spoke: </p> <p> 'Hugo rang. Said he saw you. Good night?' </p> <p> 'Daddy,' said Adrian - truly gravely - 'have you really just come in from last night this morning?' </p> <p> 'Hugo?' I heard, the second I said it. </p> <p> 'Something about someone hit him and he's lost his job? In a terrible state, sounded like.' </p> <p> What was this voice of hers saying to me? That's what I was busy working out. </p> <p> 'Hugo?' I said again - which was thoroughly absurd, this time round. </p> <p> 'Daddy?' insisted bloody Adrian. 'Have you? Really just come home now for the very first time since last night?' </p> <p> 'Wasn't a bad party. As these things go. Usual crowd. Should've come! Met someone called - can't recall his ... new face. Insisted we go on to some bloody club or other, couldn't tell you where. Hellhole. Potential client, though, so I thought I ought. God knows where the time went.' </p> <p> Ah. So that's what it was I was going to say. </p> <p> 'Daddeeeee!' piped up little Donna, God love her and save her. 'Did you bring me anything? Daddeeeee? Did you?' </p> <p> 'And me!' shot in Adrian (no slouch when it comes to handouts: wouldn't believe he'd been judge and jury just two seconds earlier). </p> <p> 'Of course, my angels - would I forget you? Never really ever known quite what it is that Hugo actually does, you know - never really thought to ask him. You seem to know him better than I do. Can be a hell of a bore - and worse when he's pissed.' </p> <p> 'Piss,' pouted Donna, 'is naughty.' </p> <p> While I was laughing like a madman at that - it got me off, didn't it, for the moment, saying any more? - Anne started looking at me deeply: made the whole of my head twitch, when she did all that - could almost feel the insistent probing, like a dentist's cruel and gleaming tool (scraping away, scraping away) as all my nerve-ends clenched and cowered. </p> <p> 'Piss isn't naughty!' poo-pooed Adrian, at his most elevated and worldly. 'Piss is just crap.' </p> <p> Anne had the goodness to say Adrian - short and reproving - and I did, I think, snigger at the flicker of utter confusion across dear little Donna's big and trusting eyes. And then, as they do, she forgot it all completely. </p> <p> 'Well where is it, Daddeeeee?' she now was singing. 'My present - where is it?' </p> <p> 'Shouldn't expect presents,' Anne was more or less grunting. 'Just because your father's been out all night ...' (and now, by God, those two bloody piercing eyes of hers had bored their way right between mine - were nearly out the other side) '... why should we expect him to give us anything?' </p> <p> 'But he said ...' protested Donna, close to tears, now. </p> <p> 'And I meant it,' was the magnanimous retort from her great grand father. Who legged it up the stairs to his study as fast as he decently dared (thank Christ Round One's in the bag) - for there was his life-saving cache of Smarties and trolls, Pez dispensers, key-rings, felt pens, dollies, toy cars, sticker sets and comics (never much of anything too beautifully packaged, though - just couldn't bear it when they tore them apart). </p> <p>While he sat at his desk - one hand cradling his newly aching temple, the other rootling around for just the right level of diversionary tactic and conscience-appeaser (not so derisory as to be scornfully everyday, nor so lavish as to nakedly betoken a crime on his part) - Jeremy suddenly caved in with a rush of tiredness and just the temporary easing of a tension that would soon be back in place, to keep him alert and protect him. And it shocked him when all of that was slid away and in came lust - the sudden vision of Maria's long and cool and warm-hot thighs (and silky, yes - they had been silky) just before they had locked themselves to each side of his face, the appalling softness of her skin making his pre-dawn stubble ache first, and then sting. It was her legs - that and the way they had carried her over: those legs of Maria's were walking all over him. </p>",
  "<p>The world is getting smaller thanks to the increasing numbers of people with access to the internet. The number of internet users in the United States is expected to reach 157.3m by 2003 - and poorer regions, too, are getting in on the act, with Latin America overcoming numerous practical hurdles to get its population online.</p> <p>Equifax, a credit reference agency based in Atlanta, Georgia, is finding a lot of business in Latin America as internet usage spreads like wildfire in the region. Equifax is one the world's biggest providers of financial information and its Equifax Secure arm aims to ensure that net transactions are safe. </p> <p>Ian McKinnon, director or Equifax Secure in Europe, says Latin America is a growth area. \"Surprisingly, we are getting a lot of business in the region,\" he said. \"The fact that they don't have massive physical infrastructure is actually an advantage.\"</p> <p>Equifax Secure's experience in Latin America shows that the internet boom is not confined to the US and Europe. The two economic giants are far ahead of the rest of the world in internet usage, but the net is catching on fast in some developing countries. In Latin America, the number of internet users, currently estimated at 10.5m, is projected to rise to between 19m and 37m by 2003.</p> <p>While analysts may differ on the potential for e-commerce in Latin America, they agree on one thing: the region has a great advantage in its young population, which is where the internet can make the most impact. The Latin American population is much younger in Europe than those of the US, Europe or Japan. </p> <p>Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, the financial services group, believes that as it matures, Latin American youth is \"more likely to embrace the net for information, entertainment and shopping than their parents or grandparents\".</p> <p>The growth of e-commerce in Latin America faces many constraints. There are fewer PC-owners. The region lacks a sophisticated telecommunications infrastructure and it suffers from weak payment systems, a rickety postal system and low credit card use. </p> <p>But these are not necessarily insuperable barriers to the spread of e-commerce. Payments can be made through cash-on-delivery couriers, and prepaid telephone cards could be adapted for internet commerce. Internet kiosks in shops, cafes, universities and other public places could make up for the low number of PCs. The lack of PCs is no deterrent to net access, judging by the experience of China, where non-PC access methods are becoming increasingly popular. Personal digital assistants, mobile phones and television set-top boxes were used to get online by nearly 590,000 people as China experiences an internet boom similar to that of Latin America.</p> <p>Internet penetration continued to skyrocket in the first six months of this year. The number of people accessing the web rose to 16.9m, an increase of 8m since the start of the year, according to the China internet network information centre. More Chinese surfers now use the net to shop online, with 14% of users buying goods or services from internet retailers. </p> <p>No wonder the Chinese government looks to the internet as an engine for economic growth, although it is also nervous at the prospect of non-party views spreading through cyberspace like a virus. The People's Daily, the official Communist party newspaper, earlier this month warned that \"enemy forces at home and abroad are sparing no effort to use this battle to infiltrate us\".</p> <p>But while net use is accelerating rapidly in Latin America and Asia, that cannot be said of Africa, which had just 2.5m users as of June this year. That total is expected to increase to only 4.4m in 2003.</p> <p>A report compiled by African portal woyaa.com and Unesco, the UN agency on educational and cultural matters, said the number of sites in all African countries, apart from South Africa, is worryingly low. This is due to the dearth of appropriate equipment and infrastructure, the lack of regulation surrounding copyright and security issues, and the low level of awareness of the benefits of the net. </p> <p>South Africa had the most diverse sites and up-to-date content, followed by sites from Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia. Sites in sub-Saharan Africa had the most room for development.</p> <p>Woyaa and Unesco call for improved training schemes and awareness campaigns as well as higher visibility for African sites through listings on international search engines.</p> <p>Public sector institutions should also provide a \"good example\" to other groups by developing comprehensive and user-friendly sites, Woyaa and Unesco argue.</p> <p>Some international effort is being mounted to help developing countries get their act together. The International Telecommunications Union, a specialised UN agency for telecommunications, is seeking to develop e-commerce in the developing world through its Electronic Commerce for Developing Countries project. </p> <p>The venture encourages developing countries to use existing infrastructures and services to join the digital economy through partnerships with the private sector. But the \u00a31.7m it has at its disposal is puny.</p> <p>Even in Latin America, which shows considerable potential, a digital divide is emerging. Brazil, Argentina and Mexico comprise more than 80% of the region's 8m internet users, while Brazil accounts for 60% of e-commerce revenues alone.</p> <p>Policy makers in the developing world thus face a twin challenge. They have to try and keep up with the US and Europe, while making sure that their own domestic digital divides do not widen.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.woyaa.com/index.html\">Woyaa.com</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://asia.internet.com/\">Asia.internet.com</a></p> <p><a href=\"mailto:mark.tran@theguardian.com\"> mark.tran@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p><strong> Age? </strong> 39. </p> <p> <strong> Who is he? </strong> Founder and CEO of sportal.com, a leading global provider of interactive sports content. Previously ran a television company in Italy. </p> <p> <strong> What's the clever idea? </strong> \"To offer people information, entertainment and interactivity on the move - anywhere, everywhere and anyhow - so they can follow their team, get the scores, communicate with fans and friends around the world of sport. Interactive coverage and live webcasts in three different forms: text, audio, video.\" </p> <p> <strong> What's the thinking behind it? </strong> \"To follow what's going on text-by-text, ball-by-ball, interactively, something you don't get on television. We already have webcasting by text, match-trackers on your PCs, and live audio of different clubs, leagues and events. Also video coverage, clearly the cream on the cake, ultimately offering live moving images and events over the PC or a wireless device. We're offering live horseracing video webcasts, so you follow the world's big races that you can't get on TV. But I don't think people will want to watch long matches on the net, though highlights and clips will be hugely popular.\" </p> <p> <strong> How does it work? </strong> \"You click on the sportal or relevant club site. It will say, 'live webcast of the game'. You click onto that and a little screen comes up on your PC, offering the game - video or audio and/or text. And the beauty is you not only follow the game, but can also click on players and get all sorts of information about them. You can click on all sorts of other statistics and records, you can click to other games to find out what's going on, you can get news and commentaries, and you can check your fantasy league team score. </p> <p>We're launching match-trackers for every Premier League game this season. Also live score trackers, so you can follow the score and tables on a second-by-second basis. As soon as a goal is scored, the table adjusts.

  "<p>These are truly interesting times for newspapers. At first glance, the link between falling sales, a new magazine distribution deal and a report by the National Economic Research Associates (Nera) on media ownership legislation may not be apparent. Two of them are a consequence of the insistent economic pressure on newspaper companies to adopt a more rational attitude towards global capitalism and, ironically, the third is the result of the continuing move towards monopoly in retailing. Those who live by the sword must die by the sword. Essentially, the result for the potential buyer will eventually mean less internal competition (less choice), greater consolidation (less diversity) and more cost-efficiency (fewer outlets). </p> <p>Let's start this dismal tale with the latest set of officially audited circulation figures and concentrate on the long-term trend. In spite of all sorts of massaging - price-cutting, bulk giveaways, cut-price subscriptions - there are many more minuses than pluses. In the six months from February to July, the 10 London-based national dailies sold an average of 12.72m copies, compared to 12.89m over the same period a year ago, 12.97m in 1998 and 13.21m in 1997. A loss of 490,000 copies over a four-year period is not a spectacular fall, but the fact that the downward trend appears to be inexorable, in spite of all manner of gimmicks designed to halt it, is very significant indeed. </p> <p>The British newspaper market is gradually shrinking, and that puts immense pressure on the weaker titles, especially at the inevitable arrival of that awful moment in the cycle when a downturn in advertising is accompanied by a rise in costs. </p> <p>Whether or not the three Express Newspapers titles are in play or not, they are among the most vulnerable. What they require is sensible investment and there is precious little sign of it coming just now from the current owner, Clive Hollick's United News &amp; Media, which is cash-rich after the sale of its TV interests. It is to be hoped that Hollick hasn't learned the wrong lesson from the Daily Star's excellent sales figures in the last couple of months. It has managed to turn itself around on a shoestring, with the smallest editorial staff and an absence of promotion. If he thinks the Daily Express, not to mention its poorly performing Sunday stablemate, would benefit from a further starvation of resources he will be in for a shock. However well the Star has done, its success is modest and no journalist working for it believes it has benefited from United's strategy. </p> <p>The two Independent titles are also finding it tough going, but their owner is in it for the long haul and shows no sign of raising the white flag just yet. Instead, we might ponder the fate of the Telegraph pair. It is difficult to understand what owner Conrad Black is up to nowadays. He has sold off titles in North America and has hinted about buying a provincial group, Regional Independent Media, here. His lordship-in-waiting can't be making a fortune from the Daily and Sunday Telegraph, given the subscription deals offered to readers: only 570,000 people pay full rate for the daily, while a mere 265,000 do so for the Sunday. Some 50,000 Daily Telegraphs are given away on planes and in hotels. Could Black be the first to crack when the cold wind blows? </p> <p>Incidentally, the decline of the Sunday circulations is even worse than that of the dailies. Using the same criteria as before, in four years the six-monthly average of the nine London-based titles has dived from 14.85m to 13.57m, a fall of more than 8.5%. </p> <p>Some papers are, of course, performing well, but the overall trend is clear and the dangers are obvious. When the bad times arrive, cost-cutting is also much more difficult to achieve in nationals than in regionals, which are solving the problem through consolidation. </p> <p>The regional industry's energetic and far-sighted mouthpiece, the Newspaper Society, is now calling for a radical overhaul of the current ownership regulations and the termination of specialist media controls to ensure that more mergers and acquisitions can occur. Rules largely drawn up in the 1960s are now considered to be totally inappropriate, according to Tim Bowdler, chief executive of Johnston Press, the fourth largest regional group. He argues, somewhat unconvincingly in my view, that the threat to the regional press from \"the new media\" makes it imperative that the government dispense with all regulation. He and his fellow owners (though not, it must be said, the smaller ones) have been supported by a Nera report which recommends that newspapers should be subject simply to general competition law. </p> <p>There are sensible changes suggested by Nera, such as some relaxation of cross-media ownership regulations. And to allow a complete free-for-all, treating papers like soap powder or baked beans and ignoring the special public interest reasons for producing newspapers, may be fine for those who believe the industry is all about making money, but it's surely against the desires of those of us who wish to enjoy continuing diversity. Logical, if ruthless, demands by shareholders for higher profit margins are inimical to the demands by readers and advertisers for choice in the marketplace. As consolidation moves forward, it is already the case that the largest 20 regional press publishers now own 84% of all titles and account for 95% of total weekly circulation. These are not bad companies and their senior executives are sincere in their belief that the benefits of size enable them to produce better quality papers. But the good in this generation may well not carry over to the next. </p> <p>Size, and the power it provides, is not always conducive to the public good, nor to the health of newspapers. A putative deal between two giants - Tesco supermarkets and WHSmith, the newspaper wholesaler - threatens to rob people of the opportunity of obtaining their morning paper. If the deal goes ahead, WHSmith will exclusively distribute magazines to all Tesco stores, overturning the current way in which 102 wholesalers across Britain distribute papers on a regional basis, a system which serves the best interests of buyers because they can pick up a paper at their local newsagent. </p> <p>It is feared that such an agreement would be followed by other supermarkets and then be extended to newspapers too. By choosing a single national wholesaler, the likely result would be a closure of hundreds of little newsagents. That, in turn, would mean people have to go to a supermarket for a paper and would also threaten home delivery services. This would threaten circulations still further, turning that gentle downward drift into a spiral. It's possible to see the Tesco-WHSmith plan as the natural next step in the erosion of the corner shop, an understandable development of that economic system newspaper owners all applaud. But do we really want it? Perhaps Mirror editor Piers Morgan, the greatest enthusiast for polling his readers, might like to ask them.</p>",
  "A few years ago the murky blue agave plants used to make tequila were so plentiful they were sometimes left to rot in the fields. Today they are under armed guard. <p>Pressured into action to combat night-time plantation raids and highway robberies of trucks, 24-hour police units now patrol the roads and lanes outside the town of Tequila - the heart of national production in the western state of Jalisco. </p> <p>\"Instead of a couple of robberies every month, we started getting three or four complaints a week, so we were getting worried,\" said Salvador Ibarra Vargas, the head of security in Tequila. </p> <p>But the patrols only cover a limited area with limited resources and limited success, encouraging bigger producers, such as Jose Cuervo and Sauza, to turn to private security firms to guard the plantations and escort trucks carrying their precious crop to the distilleries. </p> <p>\"The thieves are taking advantage of the enormous prices we are prepared to pay,\" says Gustavo Hernandez, who directs exports for the Cazadores distillery, one of the top-selling quality tequilas. </p> <p>The crime wave sweeping tequila country was prompted by this year's agave crunch, which triggered a crisis for the industry in the midst of a boom that had doubled production in last five years as drinkers in Mexico and around the world fell under the tequila spell. </p> <p>The boom has been accompanied by an education of the global palate to demand finer, purer tequilas that require much more agave to produce. </p> <p>Apparently intoxicated by success, many tequila distillers had failed to plan for the future, taking for granted the supply of the previously undervalued raw material. </p> <p>This year, however, their heads really began to spin when local growers began reneging on their contracts and demanding ever greater prices for lower quality produce. </p> <p>\"The problem is that agave takes seven to 10 years to mature, and in 1992 nobody foresaw that there was going to be a boom and so they should plant more,\" says Mr Hernandez who predicts that the crisis will last until 2003, putting in danger the consolidation of new markets. </p> <p>Last month the cost of a tonne of agave soared to 14,000 pesos (\u00a31,000), almost 25 times what it was a year ago, prompting producers and growers to negotiate a fixed price of \u00a3650 per tonne for the next two years. But according to Mr Hernandez, there are already signs that a black market is developing. </p> <p>Mr Hernandez says his own company has escaped the highway bandits, but has been targeted by \"ant robbers\". </p> <p>These teams of agave rustlers work the fields under cover of darkness, hacking off the worthless spiky leaves from the cactus-like plant to reveal its enormous pineapple-shaped core - the source of the sugary juice that will be distilled twice to make tequila. </p> <p>Mr Hernandez says a group of five \"ant robbers\" can harvest around 10 tonnes in a night, making themselves close to $10,000 (about \u00a36,000). Hijacking a truck piled high with agave cores could bring in twice as much.</p>",
  "<p>The curtain lifts today on one of biggest media circuses on earth: the Democratic Party convention in Los Angeles, held in a venue roughly the size of Crowborough, my home town in East Sussex. A substantial number of the journalists here are foreign, including a strong UK contingent. This event will be televised, broadcast and written about around the world. And I have the challenging task of trying to keep them all up to speed with what is going on. </p> <p>During the hectic round of primary elections earlier this year to choose the party's presidential hopeful, I worked with Al Gore's campaign team in Iowa and New Hampshire managing the foreign media. Something about the way I handled the seven Japanese media teams and the woolly-hatted Norwegian radio journalist who turned up with his broadcasting equipment strapped to his back expecting an immediate interview with the vice president must have struck a chord, because I've been invited back. </p> <p>My main role will be to advise the non-US media on what is happening when and where, on who is available for interview, and generally to keep them happy and on message. </p> <p>Presidential candidates today perform on a global stage. There are many votes to be won abroad. More than 1m US citizens live in the EU. There are 250,000 in the UK alone. This means putting in place an effective media management machine for the foreign journalist. Everything out here has to be done with pace and polish. When you are helping to get your man elected to what most consider to be the highest political office in the world you can't leave anything to chance. Fortunately \"our man\" has honed his media skills considerably during the gruelling primary races against Senator Bill Bradley. </p> <p>Last time, I watched him give 20 television interviews in 45 minutes without missing a beat. The cameras were set up in a strict pecking order and he calmly walked down the line giving each crew a couple of \"exclusive\" minutes before jumping aboard Air Force Two for his next campaign call. </p> <p>Good media management helped him to turn around a 5% opinion poll deficit to take Iowa and reverse Bradley's formidable 14-point lead to win in New Hampshire. Al Gore is not a man to be written off, whatever the polls say. No Democrat has won both the Iowa and New Hampshire primaries since Jimmy Carter did 26 years ago. </p> <p>Equally impressive is his wife, Tipper. Always upbeat and friendly, she is a real asset to her husband's campaign. The main challenge for the party machine this week will be to manage the presentation of the convention. By the end of the week Al Gore must bounce back in those all-important opinion polls. </p> <p>George W Bush finished the Republican Party convention 10 days ago with a \"bounce\" of just four points, taking his lead over Gore to around 14%. We were pretty pleased with that. In 92, after his convention, Bill Clinton bounced up 28 points against Bush senior but still only just managed to beat him in the autumn. </p> <p>US television coverage of both conventions is down by around two-thirds on normal years. Nevertheless, major sections of the coming days will go out live. In addition we will be putting out on the internet all the major speeches as they are delivered in the main hall. That will be a first. </p> <p>The UK media's role will be particularly interesting given that Los Angeles is eight hours behind London, making it possible for our papers to break stories before their counterparts in the US. </p> <p>Working here means learning a different language. Right now I'm off to \"get the juice\" (be fully briefed on fact, fiction and gossip) about \"surrogates\" (acceptable political stand-ins for media interviews) and possible \"goat fucking\" (minor dignitaries demanding to have their pictures taken with Al Gore.) The language in Crowborough is somewhat different.</p> <p>\u0095 Steve Morgan is managing director of Morgan Allen Moore, a public affairs company.

  "<p>What is BBC1 for? The BBC must be allowed to drop the pretence that BBC1 is the national channel if it is to move on. But we can only encourage this if we work out where the BBC should go next, and why. Therefore we need to know that Greg Dyke, the BBC's director-general, has a new philosophical argument to underpin the repositioning of the current portfolio of networks into a \"new\" BBC. </p> <p>As deputy director of television I spent the two years since the launch of BBC Choice and BBC Knowledge arguing for the development of a seven-network strategy, each complementing the others. Our first digital approach was developed in a technological haze in which we expected digital to be more like broadband. As it turned out, digital was just more telly and the two networks that we launched looked like relatively impoverished TV, rather than the reasonably well-resourced new media represented by our highly successful online site, which had the same budget as Choice. </p> <p>The answer to this dilemma, it seemed to me, lay not only in putting more money into the two new channels, but also in using their launch to rethink the whole way that we expect the BBC's channels to relate to their audiences. What is BBC1 for? Finding a central, defining reason for its exis tence is fantastically slippery. When the marketing department sought what they call a \"positioning statement\", they couldn't really find one that the people who pay for the channel would sign up to. The agency came up with: \"The power to unite,\" which the public thought was patronising and presumptuous, so we eventually settled for: \"The responsibility to unite.\" In truth, BBC1 is a mausoleum of 1950s uniformity and of an era when it was one of only two channels expected to do everything. Religion, current affairs, news, science, education and arts all had to be in the schedule, and locked into hard slots in case the channel controllers started to play fast and loose with the timing - which everyone I ever worked with felt compelled to do. The reason successive controllers felt frustrated with their schedule was that it was increasingly out of date. Towards the end of my time at the BBC, I realised that it was too hard a task for BBC1 to carry the hopes and aspirations of those of us who grew up with the big-tent definition of public service broadcasting. </p> <p>I have given many emotional speeches in defence of traditional mixed-schedule public-service television. These were driven mainly by my own experience of growing up in one of the poorest districts of Glasgow and having the BBC as my window on the culture of the world outside. However, for these past two years, as I rose to my hind legs, I felt as if I had to keep playing Jerusalem in order to drown out the shouts of digital subscribers shouting: \"Get real.\" The BBC is used to justifying the extraction of the licence fee from the poor, whose voice does not in the end carry loudly enough, and to whom we feel that the licence fee is a way of doing good by stealth, like free school meals. </p> <p>But it is going to be very difficult to extract the fee from well-off, media-savvy digital viewers unless they get what they want. And like it or lump it, we are all going to be digital in the end. By the end of next year half the population will probably be living in digital homes, and, equally importantly, half the spectrum used to reach UK viewers will be privately owned. This must have deep implications for a debate on a licence fee created when the government controlled the spectrum. </p> <p>There is a lot of misplaced panic about a speech Mark Thompson, the BBC's director of television, gave a month or so ago outlining so-called genre channels. Unless things have changed radically in the few weeks since I left the BBC, all of its four general networks - 1, 2, 3 and 4 - will contain a mix of different genres. It is the underlying weight and approach of different styles of programmes that will change and be appropriate for the network in question. Each channel, at the end of the process, should be able to answer the \"What am I for?\" question in the middle of 300 other choices. </p> <p>If this reform does not go through or penetrate deeply enough, there won't be much of a BBC to argue about in 10 years' time - its audience will have melted away, along with its political legitimacy. </p> <p>The really big question is not whether Panorama should move to BBC2; it is: \"What is the BBC for?\" Let us imagine that the new strategy works and 1 and 3 are powerful entertainment-led channels, and 2, 4 and News 24 satisfy the chattering classes, knowledge-lovers and Radio 4 listeners, and the BBC finally gets around to launching the kids' networks. Does that add up to a public service portfolio for which the government should pay by extracting a universal licence fee? </p> <p>The majority of people will probably not watch at least three of these networks in any given week, just as half the population do not listen to network radio and more than 90% never tune into Radio 3. Taking this into account, should they pay? It is a tough call. \"Don't watch, won't pay\" may well be the catchphrase for digital viewers. Therefore the BBC must be released to develop sustainable networks that viewers will watch and care about. </p> <p>The BBC and the government must come clean about what the endgame is. I would not pretend to speak for Greg Dyke, because I have no inside knowledge of what his endgame is. But I know what the defining questions must be: are we happy to accept that having a powerful BBC cross-subsidising traditional public service programming from successful mass-market media is the right answer? Is there a future for the BBC in which it is a holding company whose large, commercially funded networks subsidise publicly funded programme-making on a much-reduced licence fee? By doing this, do we guarantee adventurous, high-quality television that will increase the BBC's global significance? Will it be good enough that the BBC is a brilliant media company dedicated to taking risks? If we fetishise the mixed schedule, we'll jeopardise even this possibility. </p> <p>If we accept this change in the terms of the debate, then we can have it honestly and above board, rather than the BBC flying the flag. Unless we think these radical thoughts we will condemn the BBC to crank up the volume of Jerusalem ever louder as it marches away from a healthy future.</p> <p>\u0095 David Docherty was the BBC's deputy director of television until earlier this month when he joined Telewest.

  "Even the Daily Mail seems to have caught the habit. Comparisons, comparisons. If you want something (in the Mail's case, a tax structure helping family life) then you look to Europe. They've got it. Why are we on the outside, looking in? They've got better pensions/health-spending/education standards/public transport. Surely we can have whatever we happen to want, too? <p>It seems the most reasonable of requests, the most seductive of arguments. And it works for everybody - Eurosceptics as well as Europhiles. So Johnny Foreigner is \"backing the family\"; it must be a doddle for Johnny Bull? But the trouble with the comparison game is that you can't play it on issues \u00e0 la carte. One in, all in. You are, inevitably, talking about the nature of your society. </p> <p>Come with me to a society where the game barely exists. I haven't heard a single American politician this convention season openly cite any area of domestic policy for which any example from overseas practice holds promise for the United States. The rest of the world, for such purposes, might as well not exist. The \"dream\" (in theory, at least) is essentially insular, self-contained. </p> <p>Yet there is a wider pattern. Two of America's best political scientists - Seymour Martin Lipset and Gary Marks - have just published a book called It Didn't Happen Here (the \"It\" being any beachhead for socialism or social democracy in the land of the free). Maybe the reasons are too complex to rivet Tony Blair to his holiday deckchair: but the results laid out at the close are fascinating. </p> <p>Lipset and Marks have collected the statistics of the 90s charting the fundamental differences of structure and attitude between developed nations. They're broadbrush, and some will have shifted a little over the years. But they still - as laid out here - tell the story. </p> <p>Take trade-union contracts with employees (for wage and other bargaining purposes). Just 18% of American workers fall into this net - against 95% in Finland and 90% in France. Britain, at 47% and sliding, is the least union-contract-bound nation in the European Union. </p> <p>Take total tax receipts as a percentage of GDP. The US (though it perpetually moans about high taxes) is at 28.5%. Britain, at 36%, is the nearest to it of any major EU country. And when you take the percentage of that money used for expenditure on social security programmes, then Britain again (at 15%) is the lowest EU spender, the one closest to America's 13%. </p> <p>Inequality? No western democracy (once you include tax and transfer payments in the standard reckoning called the Gini coefficient) is less equal than the US - with a sustained rise in economic inequality throughout the 80s and 90s. But guess who's the star runner-up, with a starker Gini rise over that same period? Britain dutifully trod the American path step by step. </p> <p>And the poverty figures, unsurprisingly, cut exactly the same way. On relative poverty (the percentage of population living on less than 40% of the median income in each country) we are comfortably top of the big EU league: at 5.3%, as against Germany's 2.4%. The statistics for absolute poverty are equally bleak. </p> <p> In sum, when economic commentators talk about Britain following the US and not the European financial cycle (so that joining the euro is a perennially dodgy enterprise) they include more than stocks, shares and inflation rates. Our cycles are different because our societies are different. Forget island nations and proud heritages and all that stuff. The facts tell a different tale. We are the least European society in the EU: we are the nearest our side of the Atlantic offers to the following American way. </p> <p>Now, as Lipset and Marks say, there's constant flux. European governments are having to squeeze familiar traces of social democracy out of their systems. Market economies operate to perceived global rules. Everything is getting closer together. But the assumptions in those changing societies don't move nearly as fast. </p> <p>Where do we stand? Uncertainly betwixt and between. We are America's best chum on earth, the first country to take any president's side in a jam. We service Washington's intelligence gatherers. We shall (just watch!) help bring in the national missile defences that - in its apostolic imaginings - turn America into a vast gated community. We are slavish devotees of export Hollywood. </p> <p>Yet a great, and more subtle, divide remains. Our policies may increasingly shadow America's - even to the point of pressing them on European allies. But our attitudes are far more in tune with our EU colleagues. If your tame pollster asks Americans whether they agree \"that large income differences are needed for a country's prosperity\", then roughly a third of the population say yes - as opposed to under a quarter of Europeans. And Britain doesn't hang out at the end nearest to the US position. We're slap in the middle of European opinion. </p> <p>Ask, equally, whether it is \"the government's responsibility\" to take care of very poor people who can't take care of themselves\" and only 23% of Americans agree - as opposed to 57% of Britons (exactly the same as the Dutch). At most salient points - government involvement in economic affairs, public job creation, the length of the working week, even mandatory wearing of seat belts - there's a sharp contrast between American hostility towards what's ordained from on high, and Euro/Brit enthusiasm. Gordon Brown's last Budget, full of the usual tinkerings as well as largesse, would have got a resounding thumbs down on Capitol Hill </p> <p>It isn't just the obvious things that set us apart - the guns on the street and the long queues on death row. The plain fact about our Britain, Blair's Britain at the start of the new millennium, is that we really are adrift, stuck somewhere in mid-Atlantic. We think of ourselves as a bridge of understanding, able to explain one side to the other. But I truly wonder about that. I wonder about an identity that doesn't match attitudes, policies or gut beliefs. </p> <p>At the heart of Europe? The leaked memos of summer show us where Mr Blair stands, backbone straight, lips murmuring. The debate at home is still rooted far away from that, trapped by the assumption that there is a distinctively British way - another third way. But when I hear George W Bush promise tax rates of no more than 33%, I wonder whether there's any such choice. </p> <p>Within all the usual global limits, we need friends and models who reflect our own instincts. And if Europe can manage that - sweet, siren song - then why can't we? </p> <p> \u0095 It Didn't Happen Here, by Seymour Martin Lipset and Gary Marks, is published by Norton at $26.95. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:peter.preston@theguardian.com\"> peter.preston@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Al Gore and George W Bush are the Tweedledum and Tweedledee of politics. Two spoiled little rich boys, they are the antithesis of the log-cabin-to-White House ethos that has underpinned America's meritocratic democracy since the days of Abe Lincoln. Both are using the power of privilege and big corporate money to compensate for their mediocrity, both stand for precisely the same inconsequential things. </p> <p>If Gore imagined that he could surf to power on the back of the strength of the US economy, he has been rudely awakened. For him, this is crunch time; he needs this week's Democratic convention to put some oomph into his dreary campaign. There is broad agreement that Gore's priority is to beat back Bush's invasion of the middle ground of American politics, where the Republicans have made a beach-head with their appeal to a \"caring conservatism\". </p> <p>It is now the accepted norm that this strategy is the only way to win elections, not just in America but in Britain as well. According to this theory, the death of class as an economic force means that class politics are also dead. The days when politicians like Roosevelt or Truman could appeal to a natural working class constituency are gone. We are all middle class now, and that requires parties to hug the centre ground and pay as much attention to lifestyle as to economics. </p> <p>This is a beguiling notion, particularly for those who have done splendidly well out of the status quo of the past two decades, because it means that nothing ever really changes, or needs to change. Yes, of course, there is a bit of tinkering around at the edge when a Democrat is in the White House, but nothing that would put the wind up Wall Street. As the American economist Robert Pollin said in a recent New Left Review: \"The core of Clinton's programme has been global economic integration, with minimum interventions to promote equity in labour markets or stability in financial markets. Gestures to the least well-off have been slight and back-handed, while wages for the majority have either stagnated or declined. Wealth at the top, meanwhile, has exploded.\" </p> <p>Clinton, according to Pollin, has presided over a country which has experienced greater poverty and lower real wages than under Richard Nixon, which may explain why Gore is having so much trouble enthusing his party. Under Democrats and Republicans, the centre of gravity of politics has moved steadily to the right. </p> <p>But the political strategy only really makes sense if the basic premise - that class no longer matters - is correct. Our own Industrial Society published an example of the new thinking a couple of weeks ago, claiming that Britain was now teeming with free workers. \"Three transformations - the waves of white collar downsizing in the 80s and 90s, the rise in the proportion of value added by skilled workers and the explosion of IT - have combined to create a fertile breeding ground for a new kind of worker. Hearts hardened by the decline of corporate job protection, these workers are demanding, mobile and self-reliant. They are high on human capital and low on loyalty.\" </p> <p>Now, banish from your mind any unworthy thought that the author of this breathless prose has to be a) male, b) white, c) university educated, and d) part of the metropolitan in-crowd. Ask the question: is it really true that the working class no longer exists? </p> <p>For all the talk, America actually remains a country in which the clear majority of people are working class. When asked, 55% of Americans said they were working class, which pretty much tallies with an occupational breakdown of the US jobs market. The US department of labour's projection for the 10 occupations that would offer the most new jobs in the first years of the millennium were cashiers, janitors and cleaners, retail salespersons, waiters and waitresses, registered nurses, general managers and top executives, systems analysts, home health aides, guards, and nurses aides, orderlies, and attendants. Not much sign of the end of the working class there. </p> <p>The picture is much the same in Britain. There has been a modest increase in the number of managers and professionals, but the government's own figures show that Britain is a nation of tradesmen, secretaries, machine operatives and care workers rather than a nation of \"free workers\". </p> <p>Class only ceases to matter in the workplace if it is assumed that class is linked to whether you are employed in a blue collar or white collar job. But in reality class is not about whether you can wear what you like to the office, or whether your boss lets you dress down on Fridays. It is about power. </p> <p>Michael Zweig says in his new book The Working Class Majority*: \"Our society's growing inequality of income and wealth is a reflection of the increased power of capitalists and the reduced power of workers. In the last two decades the working class has experienced lower real incomes, longer hours at work, fewer protections by unions or government regulations, and inferior schools.\" </p> <p>Zweig's argument is that the political power of the economic elite is at least as great as it was in the 1920s, and perhaps even greater since it is no longer effectively challenged by other class interests. His view is that the Third Way does not amount to an effective defence of working class interests. The elite likes Clinton because he poses no real threat. </p> <p>But isn't it the case that the standards of living of working people have increased dramatically in the past 50 or 100 years? Isn't it true that capitalism has delivered not just for the capitalists but for everybody? This is a reasonable point, and it is true that the spread of home and car ownership, the increase in overseas travel and the blanket coverage of many consumer durables mean that the sort of lifestyle that was only available to a small minority in mid-century is now enjoyed by large chunks of the working class. </p> <p>Zweig's first point is that everybody has seen their living standards rise over the past 50 or 100 years, and that there is scant evidence that the working class has caught up with the middle class, let alone the capitalist class. Secondly, working class families have improved their lot when they have been able to take home in higher pay (or shorter working hours) a share of the increased wealth they have created through their higher productivity. As the graph shows, in the post-war period up to 1972, real wages rose in line with productivity. After 1972, productivity and output carried on rising but real wages fell for a quarter of a century until starting to rise again in 1997 as America returned to full employment. Instead of being captured by workers, America's productivity gains were captured by capital. </p> <p>Nor is this picture likely to change much. It is in the interests of the Republicans and the Democrats, reliant as they are on big business funding to give the impression that everybody is now on the same side. So while Clinton has nudged up the level of the minimum wage and raised the earned income tax credit, he has done nothing to change the power dynamics of the American economy. </p> <p>None of this means that Gore is doomed. Given that Bush appears to be a couple of spare ribs short of a barbecue, the Democrats still have a good chance of victory. But apathy will be the real winner. Gore might argue that America's working people simply do not grasp what their leaders are doing. The reality is that America's working class seems to understand only too well. </p> <p> *Michael Zweig: The Working Class Majority; ILR/Cornell University Press.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.orange.com\">Orange</a> chief executive Hans Snook yesterday confirmed the mobile telecommunications group had been \"in talks\" with Finnish phone group <a href=\"http://www.sonera.fi/english/\">Sonera</a> as speculation mounted that the Scandinavian company was on the verge of being taken over. </p> <p>Speaking to the Guardian yesterday Mr Snook said: \"It's true we do talk to them [Sonera] but anything else is pure speculation.\" </p> <p>Mr Snook, who was in Hungary on business, added: \"We have done a lot of work with them [Sonera] over the years.\" </p> <p>Other sources close to Orange confirmed that talks between Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers, Sonera's advisers, and Mr Snook's company had been held. </p> <p>It is expected that Sonera, a pioneer in wireless technology, will make an announcement on September 5 about its future. The group has pencilled in a meeting on that date to inform analysts on its overall corporate strategy. </p> <p>Sonera, which is 52.9% owned by Finland's government, put itself up for sale in June when it confirmed it was looking for strategic partners. Deutsche Telekom was initially considered a competitor to Orange in bidding for Sonera. </p> <p>However, Deutsche Telekom's recent acquisition of VoiceStream now makes this unlikely. Dutch KPN Telecom is another possible rival. </p> <p>Orange may use equity to achieve a takeover of Sonera. Britain's third biggest mobile group, bought by France T\u00e9l\u00e9com earlier this year, is planning to list by December. </p> <p>Orange sources said a $30bn (\u00a320bn) offer, which would value Sonera at around $41 a share, was a little high. </p> <p>A Sonera spokesman declined to confirm the speculation yesterday. </p> <p>The Finnish government gained parliamentary approval to reduce its stake in Sonera to zero, which could be achieved either through share-based mergers and acquisitions, sales or other strategic investments. </p> <p>Orange, Sonera and Spain's Telefonica were partners in the race to win a third generation (3G) mobile phone licence in Germany. </p> <p>However, the takeover by France T\u00e9l\u00e9com meant Orange had to withdraw from the 3G contest to avoid a conflict of interest. France Telecom was also bidding in the German auction. </p> <p>Sonera would fit with Orange and France T\u00e9l\u00e9com's strategy to build a global wireless business to rival that of Vodafone. </p> <p>Orange and Sonera are considered similar as both companies are at the forefront of technological developments in data services on mobiles as well as bill paying systems. </p> <p>The string of multi-billion mobile phone deals are becoming commonplace as each of the operators jostle to gain scale. </p> <p>As a small but successful operator Sonera is well aware of the challenges it faces with a tiny subscriber base, despite operating in the market that has the world's highest penetration of mobile usage. </p> <p>Sonera also owns a 37.3% stake in Turkcell and is building networks in Hungary and the Baltics. It also owns a string of valuable minority holdings in VoiceStream, Powertel and Eliska Wireless Ventures. </p> <p>Sonera has developed one of the most advanced wireless internet portals, called Zed, and a software encryption system, SmartTrust, to allow secure shopping from mobiles. </p> <p>Commerzbank said in a report recently that a takeover of Sonera would be done best if Sonera's management could retain the high level of independence that Hans Snook achieved when Orange was sold to France T\u00e9l\u00e9com. </p> <p>A deal depends on how much the Finnish government is prepared to sacrifice as Sonera is the country's second largest listed company. </p> <p>In the middle of this year Finland's communications minister Olli-Pekka Heinonen, said the government did not want \"Sonera to become a bite-sized morsel for someone else to swallow\". </p> <p>\u0095 Telefonica said yesterday it was determined to win a 3G mobile phone licence in Germany, despite being seen as an outsider likely to drop out of the race. \"In Germany we are very serious and we have more steam and financial means than others,\" said a Telefonica Moviles spokesman. After Debitel abandoned its bid on Friday after the price for a licence climbed well past 10 billion marks (\u00a33bn).</p>",
  "<p>So far so good. Japan abandoned its zero interest rate policy on Friday and raised the cost of borrowing for the first time in 10 years. The markets took the announcement in their stride. </p> <p>The move came too late in the day to have much impact in the far east, but in Europe and the US it prompted little reaction. By the end of trading in London, the yen, which some thought would strengthen, was unchanged at 108.7 to the dollar. </p> <p>Masaru Hayami, the Bank of Japan's governor, will no doubt have felt vindicated. Yet, the longer they think about it, the more the markets might begin to doubt the wisdom of his action. </p> <p>Despite a mild recovery of company profitability and a pick up in investment spending, largely due to the buoyancy of global demand, the domestic economy remains weak and consumer prices are still falling. Few independent analysts share Mr Hayami's belief \"that the economy has reached the stage where deflationary concern has been dispelled\". </p> <p>At the same time that the economy's cyclical position is in doubt, a programme of structural reform is under way which, while ultimately beneficial, could depress demand in the short term. The collapse last month of the Sogo department store group, Japan's largest non- financial bankruptcy, shows that banks and corporations are at last beginning to wake up to to the reality of rising loan-losses and bad assets. </p> <p>Instead of focusing on providing lifetime employment, firms are putting profitability first. In the long run, this should ensure their survival, but the dole queue is likely to lengthen and nervous consumers could become even more wary of spending. </p> <p>Mr Hayami's determination to increase interest rates - he has been agitating to do so since April - was intended to spur the reform process by taking away the crutch of free money. But the danger is that the economy will fall over. In a report published on Friday, the IMF said that reform was best carried out against a backdrop of a recovery and that today's upswing remained \"fragile and subject to downside risk\". </p> <p>The early removal of a stimulatory monetary policy could send the economy back into recession, it warned. </p> <p>In 1997, the Japanese government tightened fiscal policy prematurely. It subsequently spent far more in stimulatory fiscal packages than the savings it originally planned to make. </p> <p>The markets will be watching the Japanese economic data due out over the next few weeks with a keener interest than usual in order to judge whether Mr Hayami has made a similar mistake over monetary policy.</p>",
  "Drivers are today being urged to boycott BP service stations as part of the campaign to persuade Gordon Brown to cut the cost of motoring. So far, Dump the Pump has been a damp squib. The RAC, while sympathising with motorists, believes there are better ways of getting the message across. <p>Whatever its final outcome, however, the brouhaha about the cost of motoring raises big questions about the UK tax system. Has the government's willingness to push up excise duties faster than the rate of inflation merely accentuated the trend started by Margaret Thatcher of making taxes less progressive - that is, landing the poor with a larger tax bill? And is there any evidence that raising excise duties can be used to curb consumption of things the government doesn't like, such as pollution and deaths related to tobacco? </p> <p>Despite the changes of the past 20 years, the tax system is still progressive because people pay more tax as they get richer. But, as the Institute for Fiscal Studies notes, \"the switch from direct to indirect taxes has reduced the progressivity of the tax system to the advantage of those on high incomes and at the expense of those on low incomes\". </p> <p>What has happened is that governments have cut income tax, particularly for the highest income groups, but have raised taxes on spending. In 1979, the top rate of income tax was 83% and the basic rate 33%; VAT was levied at 8%. Geoffrey Howe's first budget in June 1979 cut the top rate to 60% and the basic rate to 30%, while pushing VAT up to 15%. The next big move was made by Nigel Lawson in 1988, when he reduced the top rate to 40% (where it remains) and dragged the basic rate down to 25%. VAT was raised to 17.5% by Norman Lamont in 1991 to pay for the abolition of the poll tax. And the basic rate is now 22% courtesy of Gordon Brown. </p> <p>All this has made the tax system less progressive because the rich, especially the top 1% of the population, have been the main beneficiaries of cuts in direct taxation. The poor spend a higher proportion of their incomes on goods that incur VAT and excise duties. Increases in income tax are now off the political agenda in Britain, with governments seeking other ways to raise revenues. So-called sin taxes on fuel, tobacco and - to a lesser extent - alcohol have been justified because the government would like us to cut consumption. </p> <p>But do higher taxes really lead us to drive our cars less, give up the filthy weed and cut back on booze? Some sin taxes are more successful than others. The World Bank and the World Health Organisation said last week that a 10% increase on cigarette prices worldwide would reduce consumption by 4% in high-income countries and by 8% in low-income countries, persuading 42m people to give up smoking and saving 10m lives. </p> <p>In a report aimed at cutting consumption in developing countries, the two organisations said government action to increase cigarette taxes would not lead to lower tax revenues in the medium to long term. Tax increases that raise the price of cigarettes by 10% worldwide would increase revenues by about 7% on average. \"The evidence indicates that young people are more responsive to price changes than adults. Further studies indicate that people on low incomes and people with lower levels of education are also more responsive to price changes than wealthier, highly-educated people.\" </p> <p>The picture for petrol is slightly more complex. The IFS says that a 1% increase in the real cost per mile of driving will reduce miles driven by less than 0.5%. \"This is not a very large response, which suggests that any attempt to reduce reliance on the car by increasing the cost of fuel will not have been very successful.\" </p> <p>The IFS findings show why the Dump the Pump campaign is proving unsuccessful. In the jargon of economists, demand for petrol is extremely price inelastic. We fill up regardless even when it hurts our purses and wallets. </p> <p>While in general indirect taxes hurt the poor most, it is a slightly different story with fuel taxes because the poorest people in Britain do not own cars. As a result, the effect of higher fuel duties is felt most by those on middle incomes, according to the IFS. \"If we take only households that own cars, the cost of living of the lowest (car-owning) income groups is the most adversely affected by the tax increase, with the effect becoming smaller as we move up the income distribution.\" </p> <p>For the government, there are short- and long-term implications of all this. Firstly, the aims of ever-higher taxes on fuel tend to conflict. The very fact that demand for fuel is price inelastic means it is a wonderful source of revenue for the Treasury. If the government did succeed in deterring people from driving in significant numbers the result would be the loss of a valuable source of revenue. </p> <p>Secondly, increasing the cost of filling up the tank hits the group that Labour has assiduously courted in recent years: those on middle incomes. Finally, while a cleaner and greener environment is a worthwhile goal, the chances of achieving that via escalating taxes on motorists looks pretty remote. People drive because they value their mobility and will only cease to use cars when there is a viable, cost-effective and reliable alternative. That means improvements - big improvements at that - in public transport, not just in rural areas but in the towns and cities as well. </p> <p>\u0095 Larry Elliott is economic editor and Charlotte Denny economics reporter.<br><a href=\"mailto:larry.elliott@theguardian.com\">larry.elliott@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>What we would like to call the boss and what professional protocol demands of us might be two very different things. Two men with novel attitudes to their status in society have recently tested office attitudes to 21st-century formality. </p> <p>First up was newly knighted Financial Services Authority chairman Howard Davies, who, by practising modesty in the workplace, is also raising funds for his favourite football team, Manchester City. Davies has imposed a penalty of \u00a31 on anyone who dares calls him \"Sir\" - a title that no doubt comes loaded with one too many school-day memories. </p> <p>It was an anonymous source that spilt the beans on their rather less reticent senior at BT, where Sir Peter Bonfield was apparently prepared to go global with his new title. Insiders claim that he has tacked his knighthood on to his email address - it now reads, rather loftily, sir.peter.bonfield@ ...</p> <p>But who decides what we call the boss - them or us? Popular titles through the ages differ in sentiment and have included variations on guv, chief, boss, cheese, honcho or just plain old wanker. Opinion seems to be divided on how a name is arrived at. </p> <p>\"I think that it's not so much that you are obliged to call a boss by their title - I'd say if it was a very senior manager, you would address them as they wished,\" says Julie Amber, conference manager for the Industrial Society. \"Partly because of their seniority and partly through courtesy. Titles confirm hierarchy and those that use them want that hierarchy emphasised.\" So what does she make of bosses who want to be addressed by their title? \"I can understand that if someone has worked hard for a title and are proud of it, they would want it acknowledged, but I wouldn't do it myself,\" she says, diplomatically. </p> <p>\"It's certainly not a very empowering way to work. It creates an us-and-them situation with work ers and management, which usually results in people feeling that they don't really have a stake in their organisation. Hierarchy is a way to command and control and it certainly doesn't sit very well in the 21st century,\" Amber explains. </p> <p>Rank and position aside, even the formal use of \"Mr\" is proving to be a bit too last-century for most. Judy Fisher, of recruitment consultants Judy Fisher Associates, says of her experience: \"Of all our current clients I can think of only one boss who likes to be called Mr. It's very unusual these days for anyone not to be called by their first names. Our temps even call Sir Richard Eyre 'Richard'. </p> <p>\"I can only ever remember one of our clients, an elderly peer of the realm, who insisted on being called by his title. Even then everyone called him Lordy.\" </p> <p>Richard Grace, managing director of secretarial recruiters Gordon Yates, believes that there is, however, a place for more formal attitudes in the office. \"Titles are a bit like verbal dress codes. Nine times out of 10 you would formally address the boss the first time you met them as Mr, and Ms is always a good compromise,\" he says. \"I would advise that you should not take too many liberties with names and to always err on the side of caution, unless otherwise advised.\" </p> <p>Rachel Finbow, operations manager of Recruitment Employment Services, recommends waiting for a hint from the boss. \"We tend to tell our workers to address bosses how they refer to themselves. Ninety-five percent of our bosses are referred to by their first names. It's only the old fashioned companies, such as surveyors, accountants and law firms, and usually the older clients, that want you to call them 'Mr So-and-so'.\" </p> <p>Finbow believes that the thorny issue of whether to address a female boss as \"Miss\", \"Mrs\" or \"Ms\" can be avoided with an informal touch. \"We've got lots of female bosses and I can't think of one who wants to be referred to by their surname,\" she says. \"I would never advise using the term 'Ms'. People aren't comfortable with it and it certainly doesn't flow very easily.\" So, if \"Mr\" is too formal, and \"Ms\" too tricky, who could blame office workers for coming up with a name of their own? \"Sir\" and \"Old fart\" could, after all, be interchangeable titles.</p>",
  "Fashion is about staying ahead of the game. Yet compared to other industries, such as car manufacture or telecommunications, the clothing industry is backward, and fashion designers deeply conservative. Apart from the odd technical fibre here and utility pants there, clothes are made in much the way they were 2,000 years ago: spin fibre into thread, weave thread into cloth, cut into pieces, then sew back together again. This is about to change. <p>Few fashion designers will be prepared for the first collection from three visionary partners when it goes on sale later this month. Levi's ICD+ is an unprecedented collaboration between Philips, Europe's largest electronics company, Levi's, one of the world's largest clothing manufacturers, and designer Massimo Osti, who was last year voted most influential designer of the 90s by menswear magazine Arena Homme Plus. Between them, the trio hope to produce the first really credible, successful range of technical clothing. The first ICD+ range incorporates Philips mobile phone and MP3 technology into a range of jackets designed by Osti and made by Levi's. </p> <p>But the project goes much further than jeans with mobile phone pockets. Superficial \"utility-look\" clothing is over: this is a serious attempt to merge fashion and electronics. \"Levi's heritage is based on the tradition of workwear, but our first miner's pants were launched in 1873 - we needed to examine what people need from workwear today. We identified a group we call nomads who are constantly on the move, always in taxis or airports and need to be wired, so we began looking for partners,\" says Peter Ingwersen, of Levi's. </p> <p>Philips has been working away quietly for years on a project called Philips Wearable Electronics, and this collaboration with Levi's is the first to bear fruit. The project mission statement is \"Philips technology in every shirt and skirt\" and the result will be widely available following this autumn's launch. </p> <p>The electronics group envisions a future in which all garments will contain micro-computers. \"This first collection is the equivalent of laying the first brick in The Great Wall of China. Our goal is to give the objects around us intelligence, so they become our subjects, and this includes our clothes,\" says Stefano Marsano, managing director of Philips Design. </p> <p>Philips is not alone in developing wearable electronics, but it is leading the field. Watch manufacturers including Swatch, Casio and Citizen have announced that they are developing wrist phones, pagers, ski passes and translators. The textile groups Courtaulds and Dupont are working on conductive fibres but so far, the only fashion brand to commit to commercial production of wearable electronics is Levi's. </p> <p>The possibilities are mindboggling. This autumn's jackets feature phones which can be dialled using voice recognition technology, and a microphone and earphones built into the hood or collar. The MP3 player automatically cuts out when the phone rings, and the whole lot is machine washable. Everything is controlled via a keypad hidden beneath a pocket flap. The most challenging aspect of the project, according to Osti, has been to soften and humanise the technology. \"The challenge is not miniaturisation as we currently think of it - making something smaller - but to make it flat and flexible so it becomes a second skin, completely invisible. We aim to massage the technology into the garment,\" say Osti. </p> <p>His name is not widely known, even in fashion circles, because he doesn't use his name on the label, doesn't stage fashion shows and says he isn't interested in being liked by the fashion crowd. But starting in 1975 with the labels Stone Island and CP Company, and later with Left Hand, Massimo Osti Production, and the more recent Equipment for Legs project for Dockers, Osti has consistently put functionality into fashion. </p> <p>At his studio in Bologna, in Italy, he has a collection of more than 25,000 garments, mainly military uniforms, which provide inspiration. Now he wants to use his 25 years of research into fabric and function to bring the latest technology to the masses. \"We want to make ICD+ as ubiquitous as the mobile phone,\" he says. This is just the beginning. In the future, we may see global positioning systems, just like the ones in cars, incorporated into clothes. So when you fly to a new city you'll be able to give the cab driver directions to your destination, using a built-in translator. </p> <p>More outlandish ideas include a face-recognition camera in the hood which discreetly tells you a person's name and vital information when you meet them again. Parents could keep an eye on children through miniature cameras. And all this technology will be invisible, submerged in the fabric. However, one of the reasons for wearing clothes is to look good and a triumph of function over fashion simply won't sell. But, says Osti: \"These clothes contain a lot of technology but don't appear too sci-fi. As always with my designs, form follows function and this is the next step in functionalism. It's important they look beautiful and I struggled to achieve the right level of fashionability because these garments are built to last.\"</p>",
  "More than 300 boats took to the waters of Windermere yesterday to protest at the introduction of a 10mph speed limit due to come into effect in 2005. <p>The limit, proposed by the Lake District national park, will ban jetskis and power boats from the lake, the only one in the region open to high-speed craft. </p> <p>The move has been opposed by speed enthusiasts since it was first proposed eight years ago. They claim that the pleasure of thousands will be wrecked by the limit which will also damage the local economy and ruin boat businesses operating on the lake. </p> <p>Yesterday's three-mile long armada, with crews waving protest banners, consisted mainly of power boats. \"People have voted with their keels to show their disapproval of the decision,\" said Norman Park, the protest's organiser, who claimed more than 4,000 people had taken part. </p> <p>The turn-out was three time as big as a rally in April, held three weeks after environment minister Chris Mullin announced he would uphold the limit. </p> <p>His decision followed a dispute between environmentalists, residents, national park authorities, sport enthusiasts and businesses. The conflict led to a 13-week public inquiry.</p>",
  "William Wordsworth saw it all coming. Let the railway be extended from Kendal to Low Wood, at the head of Windermere, he warned in a letter to the Morning Post in 1844, and the Lake District would cease to be that wild tract of nature which travellers came to see. \"The staple of the district is its beauty and its character of seclusion and retirement,\" he wrote. If what he called \"the imperfectly educated classes\" were to come by train in large numbers, the very beauty which drew them would be destroyed. He also feared for what in those days was the peaceful little town of Bowness. <p>The great poet did not, for obvious reasons, specifically mention speedboats. But for years now, his spiritual heirs have wanted to banish high-speed boats from Windermere by imposing a 10mph limit. They have now won that case, though the ban will not take effect until 2005. Yesterday jet skiers and high-speed boaters were out in force to protest both at the threat to their sport and at the implications for commercial interests around the lake. They mean to go on protesting until the decision is reversed. </p> <p>This is a dispute where there cannot be compromise. And however much they dislike it, the decision does result from what seems to have been an impeccable process. The Lake District National Park Authority proposed the limit; the relevant authorities were fully consulted; a public inquiry took place; and the Department of the Environment confirmed the inspector's view that high-speed boats should, in effect, be banned. And one does not need to echo the language of Wordsworth to agree that tranquillity ought to come first. The ideal place for this kind of sport is on man-made lakes, of which there are many already around the country and could be more. What a boost it could be to the stricken towns of West Cumbria, now so apprehensive about the future of Sellafield, if a new speedboat capital could be established out there, rather than in Bowness.</p>"
