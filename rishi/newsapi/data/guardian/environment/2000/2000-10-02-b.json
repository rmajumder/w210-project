  "<p><strong>A BAD DAY IN THE BEDROOM</strong></p> <p>Poor Stan Collymore. He stays locked in his room all day, only emerging to get the Dairylea triangles his mummy occasionally leaves outside the door. Or to fetch some more tissues. But no matter how much he tries to stay out of bother, he still manages to come a cropper.</p> <p>Poor Colly started the day by lying totally still under his sheets and breathing only through his nose. But within a couple of hours, Leicester announced that they had agreed to the transfer request Stan put in after he was definitely not sacked for asking for a ridiculously unwarranted pay rise. \"Leicester City today agreed to a transfer request from Stan Collymore and the player has been placed on the transfer list,\" a statement read. \"Neither Leicester City nor Mr Collymore will be making any further comment.\"</p> <p>Stan then climbed in the wardrobe and stuffed Gary, the funny dinosaur, in his mouth for over two hours but to no avail. He'd already done a bad thing by stamping on Paul Gascoigne's hand last week, and today he was charged with violent misconduct by the FA on the recommendation of the video advisory panel. Stan faces a minimum three-match suspension and a fine of two weeks' wages - which could mean even more time spent in his den. Yay!</p> <p><strong>DAUM, DAUM, DEEPER AND DAUM</strong></p> <p>When you're manager of an international football team, you expect to be given a rough ride by your critics. The Fiver, for example, has been known to refer to Kelvin Koogan as a \"bally idiot\" and even, in times of severe trauma, an \"tactically inept, badger-haired daft get\". But the esteemed England boss has never had to put up with the sort of abuse currently being thrown at Germany's manager-in-waiting Christoph Daum, who has been accused of being involved in an extortion racket, sleeping with prostitutes and taking cocaine.</p> <p>The accusations come from Uli Hoeness, the general manager of popular German giants Bayern Munich - and a man who in June this year actually voted for Daum to become the next manager of Germany. \"Things have changed since I opted for Daum,\" spat Hoeness. \"We are talking about his private surroundings, his advertisement contracts, about extortion charges and prostitution, about all shit.\" </p> <p>Hoeness had clearly been reading tatty German rag Abendzeitung, which based its story on statements from the cuckolded former husband of Daum's new girlfriend - hmm. However, even this esteemed journal could not furnish Hoeness with any hard facts to back up his rant: \"I don't have any evidence yet, but if this is true, I won't participate in helping become national coach.\"</p> <p>Sadly for Hoeness, Daum is being encouraged to take steps to save his good name. Reiner Calmund, general manager of Daum's current club Bayer Leverkusen, said: \"These accusations are infamous, insidious and malicious. There has been no similar defamation in the whole history of the Bundesliga. Hoeness himself says that he has no evidence, he talks using the subjunctive and this will make it difficult to take him to court. However, we will advise Daum to take legal action.\" Suddenly, putting up with Koogan and his innocent ways doesn't seem so bad, does it?</p> <p><strong>QUOTES OF THE DAY - COCKNEY DENIAL SPECIAL</strong></p> <p>\"The rumours are rubbish, absolute rubbish\" - A West Ham official assures Teamtalk that Harry Redknapp did not offer his resignation after his side's 1-1 draw with Bradford on Saturday.</p> <p>\"It's just not true\" - West Ham managing director Paul Aldridge denies they are about to sell Rio Ferdinand to Leeds. Again.</p> <p><strong>LIPPI GETS LIPPY</strong></p> <p>Not so long ago, Marcello Lippi was winning scudetto after scudetto and being lauded as the \"greatest manager in the world\" by no less an authority than the Imperial Lord Ferg. Today, however, the Uncle Fester-jawed coach of Internazionale is locked in \"crisis talks\" with trigger-happy president Massimo Moratti after his team's shock 2-1 defeat to Reggina on the opening day of the Italian season.</p> <p>Considering Moratti's predilection for sacking managers - eight in the past five years is a record that would make even Jesus Gil blush - you might have expected Lippi's Gucci trousers to be kissing some serious concrete today. But the Inter boss has obviously opted for a different approach. \"If I was Inter's president, I would fire the coach and I would take all the players and kick them up the arse,\" he said, offering a not-so-subtle hint to Moratti. \"If good players play badly like that, it can only be because they don't believe in the tactics anymore and they must talk frankly with me about that.\"</p> <p>Alas, that's the last thing the Internazionale players have been doing. \"I speak with them all week and they never say anything,\" continued Lippi. \"We can't go on in this way because we must respect the fans and we must respect ourselves, too.\" Later, Moratti seemed to agree: \"I have not had contact with other coaches, but what Lippi said yesterday makes things very complicated for him.\" Now, although the Fiver's no Godfather, we sense change afoot. And with Marco Tardelli - Italy's Olympic football coach and the favourite to step into the Inter hot seat - now back from Sydney, expect things to get even more \"complicated\" for Lippi later this evening.</p> <p><strong>THE RUMOUR MILL</strong></p> <p>Manchester City are lining up Norwegian U-21 international right back Ragnvald Soma, reports Planet Football. Sunderland, Middlesbrough, Newcastle and Leicester are also reported to be interested in the player.</p> <p>George Graham has confirmed he wants to sign Aston Villa defender Ugo Ehiogu - but he doesn't seem convinced that Alan Sugar will stump up the \u00a38m needed to buy him. \"Of course I would be interested in buying Ehiogu, but I don't worry about the price,\" said Graham. \"I just name the players I want and then leave it up to the club.\" </p> <p><strong>NEWS IN BRIEF</strong></p> <p>Dennis Wise and Steven Gerrard will escape FA censure after they squared up during Chelsea's 3-0 defeat of Liverpool.

  "<p>Amazon.com will today take its patent fight against BarnesandNoble.com to the US Federal Appeals Court - the precursor to the US Supreme Court. </p> <p>The dispute centres on a controversial ongoing patent claim for \"one-click\" technology that reared its head at the end of last year, when Amazon won round one. </p> <p>Amazon argues that it has exclusive rights to the technology that enables online purchases to be made with one click of a computer mouse. In the current climate of global innovation, its arguments may appear weak, but Amazon does hold the patent to one-click purchasing, even if this is tantamount to someone holding the patent to in-store book-buying while wearing black trousers. </p> <p>While the case is unlikely to be resolved in the immediate future, the outcome will have severe repercussions in the global market for internet innovation. Whatever the result, the case is expected to establish a major precedent. If Amazon wins, the general feeling is that other business process patents will get the green light.</p> <p>The spat between the two book retailers began in autumn 1999 when Amazon issued a writ against its arch-rival over alleged infringement of its one-click ordering system. The court issued a preliminary injunction and B&amp;N was forced to add a cosmetic \"second-click\" to its purchasing system. </p> <p>The outcome of this preliminary hearing indicated the court thought one-click ordering was all down to Amazon and that B&amp;N was taking a \"'free ride\" on Amazon's idea. The irony is that Amazon's one-click technology is the most natural and obvious extension of e-commerce and, by restricting it to one player, the US Patent &amp; Trademark Office is thwarting innovation. </p> <p>It is widely accepted that the reason why Amazon became so dominant so quickly is because it was hell-bent on patenting everything, effectively squeezing competitors out of the market. Patenting is getting silly and, thankfully, no technology business process has yet been granted patent approval in the UK. The US needs to look closely at the willingness of the USPTO to grant 17-year restrictive patents. </p> <p>Even Jeff Bezos wants to see patent laws restructured, with particular attention given to the granting and duration of business method and software patents. This is despite the fact that he has no intention of giving up any of his patents.</p> <p>These days there seems to be a general movement towards working closely with the e-commerce industry as a whole, rather than just one player. Hopefully, we will see a few changes in the way in which future patents are dished out. </p> <p>Of course, Amazon is not alone in gobbling up competitor-killing patents. Priceline.com holds the US patent to reverse auctions and BT claims to have the patent for hyperlinks. And many other companies have rushed to take advantage of these new business protections. In 1999, the USPTO said it received 2,600 business method patent applications - of which, 600 were granted. The whole business of patenting a business process is questionable. </p> <p>Even if business process patenting has so far occurred only in the US, the global nature of the internet means any patenting developments will have wide-reaching repercussions on new business ideas in the UK and Europe.</p>",

  "<p>French media conglomerate Vivendi announces its half-year results today as the European Commission prepares to wind up its investigation into the company's proposed merger with Seagram of Canada.</p> <p> The \u00a323bn merger between Vivendi, its Canal Plus television subsidiary, and Seagram, owner of Universal Studios and Universal Music, signals the French company's intent to be a major player in the global media world.</p> <p> The company is confident that the deal will have an easier ride from the EC than the proposed tie-up between US giants AOL and Time Warner, which is struggling to meet concerns over the who controls music downloads over the internet. One of Vivendi's key aims is to \"be a successful challenger of monopolies\", and the EC will rule on the merger by October 13.</p> <p> But Vivendi's media arm, which is formed by a 44% holding in telecoms company Cegetel, joint ownership of Canal+ and complete control of advertising firm Havas, is dwarfed by the rest of the group. Vivendi Environnement, the company's environmental services arm, contributed 54% of last year's E41.6bn (\u00a324.9bn) sales, with a further 25% provided by the construction and property businesses. The media subsidiary came in last with 21%.</p> <p> These figures will almost certainly change if Vivendi gets the all-clear from the EC and US regulators for the Seagram merger. Several deals are already in position, including the launch of a UK movie channel run by Universal Studios and cable operator NTL.</p> <p> Vivendi's chairman, Jean-Marie Messier, has ambitious plans for the company, and will reveal more strategic aims at the results presentation. A completed Seagram deal will add significant amounts of content to Vivendi's telecoms and internet infrastructure.</p> <p> Messier can expect to be challenged over his company's 25% holding in Rupert Murdoch's BSkyB, as he is known to be seeking a change in the arrangement. Messier wants to fold his stake in the UK satellite and digital broadcaster into Sky Global Networks, the subsidiary formed by the satellite TV companies within Murdoch's News Corporation organisation.</p>",

  "While the film Billy Elliot was drawing huge crowds at the cinema yesterday, and expected to break first-weekend box office records, the real life inspiration for the heart-warming story was at a Royal Ballet gala - and looking back on his own arabesque from northern backstreets to Covent Garden. <p>In the case of the Royal Ballet star Philip Mosley it was Barnsley rather than Billy's north-east, and the thumping rhythm of The Jam's A Town Called Malice had to be in his own small head rather than on Dolby cinema speakers. </p> <p>But the film's key, exhilarating sequence in which the miner's son pirouettes and leaps his way through the cobbled streets with sheer love of dance, came straight from Mosley's briefings to the screenwriter Lee Hall. </p> <p>\"It was dead-on - how could I forget it,\" said Mosley's mother, Margaret, who was machine-seaming tights for Marks &amp; Spencer when her son was skipping rings round his twin brother, Paul, on the way back from Cudworth junior. \"I was chatting to our Philip this morning,\" she said yesterday. \"And we were going over how really close they got that bit and the part where he taps down the street.\" </p> <p>Philip remembers how dreams of being Barnsley's answer to Gene Kelly go back \"as long as I can remember. There was almost nothing but mining round my village, but my family were very supportive all the way through.\" He half-ran, half-toddled to dancing class alongside his older sister Anita, whose own daughter Melissa was having her usual Sunday morning with Grandma yesterday. </p> <p>In the film Billy Elliot pretends he's at boxing while he slips into the girls' ballet class, fearful of his dad's very vocal disapproval. Mosley never hid his passion. His mother said: \"He wasn't even three but he went on at me about going with her. I tells him: 'Lads don't go to dancing class' but he was just a bit persistent. So I asks the teacher, Rosalind Wicks, if she takes lads and she jumped at him. She says: 'We certainly do, if we can ever get them'.\" </p> <p>Mosley was ribbed at school but protected by three older brothers, including Michael, the only one of the seven children to follow both grandfathers down Darfield Main pit. </p> <p>Unlike Billy's father in the film, who was initially furious at his youngest son's desire to play \"girls'\" games, Mosley's dad, Albert, a plumber, was not averse to dance. He and Margaret had seen the South Yorkshire town caught by dance fever at a crucial time in their own lives. </p> <p>\"Everyone remembers the maple floorboards they put across the swimming baths in Race Street,\" said Annie Storey, a Barnsley local historian who made the famous London Tiller girls in the 1950s. \"There was always an extra spring in the dance floor because it wasn't solid underneath. There was one young man who used to go dancing at the baths who had a variety of brightly coloured suits - very vivid, not unlike Showaddywaddy.\" </p> <p>It wasn't exactly a tradition, but it gave a bit of history to men gambolling about in a tough mining community. When Philip was nine, two friends joined him at dancing class and when he was entered for a free scholarship to the Royal Ballet's school in White Lodge, Richmond Park, south-west London, the neighbours celebrated heartily. </p> <p>Mrs Mosley, now retired like her husband, said: \"Philip had been doing it so long, that no one really gave it a second thought. They'd come round to our house, just a terrace then though we've got three bedrooms now, and say: 'How's the lad doing?' Everyone knew that Albert was always finding time between jobs to run him around to classes or performances, and there were real celebrations when he got in.\" </p> <p>Philip, now 33, is a first artist with the Royal Ballet and his roles have included Puck in A Midsummer Night's Dream. He recalled White Lodge as having an unexpectedly wide social mix. \"Though I did keep quiet about my mother working in a factory.\" He was also on the phone to Cudworth a lot at first, homesick at the age of only 12 and in novel and competitive, rather than cosy, surroundings. </p> <p>\"I always said to him: 'Philip, you can come home any time you want to',\" said Margaret, who shares with Albert, 68, a democratic pride that all their children - another plumber, a joiner, an electrician, a hairdresser, a mother and housewife and a mobile phone company executive - \"have found themselves a trade.\" But she added: \"I never thought Philip'd give up for a moment. He was that keen to dance. I knew he'd keep at it and he did.\" </p> <p>When the Mosleys now pay their annual visit to Covent Garden, dancing takes on 'n extra dimension for their son, who said: \"I think of what they gave up to put me through, and I do get quite emotional, because I know my mum's trying to tell everyone in the whole row, 'That's my son up there'.\" </p> <p>His mother echoed: \"We are very proud of him. We're glad he didn't have to go through everything Billy Elliot had to face.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Gap's most senior marketer has resigned following a series of profit warnings by the US fashion retailer.</p> <p>Jim Nevins, executive vice-president of global marketing at The Gap, resigned last week without a job to go to. The company said it had wanted him to take on a broader brand development role, a change he was unwilling to make. Amy Schoening, head of marketing for The Gap's sister brand, Banana Republic, will fill in until a replacement is found.</p> <p>The move has prompted speculation that the company, which is one of the only major advertisers to create all its advertising in-house, could seek the services of an advertising agency for its next campaign. The creation of the company's advertising campaigns has in the past been spearheaded by Nevins.</p> <p>The Gap's marketing department is structured in a similar way to an advertising agency. Last year the company spent \u00a313 million on advertising in the UK. </p> <p>The Gap issued two profit warnings last month, sending shares plummeting and denting confidence in a company which had been regarded as a marketing miracle. Analysts said the retailer had scared older customers away with its new emphasis on high fashion and people would only shop there for weekend wear and not for casual work clothes.</p>",
  "<p>BMW has appointed German advertising agency Jung von Matt to handle the worldwide launch of the new Mini Cooper.</p> <p>BMW retained the rights to the new Mini when it sold Rover earlier this year.</p> <p>The new model is targeted at younger car drivers, in contrast to the typically well-heeled BMW consumer.

  "<p>Older people, as we all know, are a problem. The litany of challenges they present is wearily familiar: tax systems will struggle to bear the cost of caring for dependent older people; employers will search in vain for the young labour on which they once relied; the new economy is built on youth and speed. The dot.com entrepreneurs, the startup upstarts, are overthrowing the old economy - and older workers along with it. The over 50s are out of work and on the shelf. </p> <p>To feed these concerns, an industry has grown up to bemoan the obsolescence of older workers. Lobby groups have been established to protect the benefit rights of the oldest and weakest in society and are creating a victim culture among over 50s. Easing the path to early retirement is a priority for these campaigners given that the world of work is considered so very difficult for older workers. </p> <p>But the over 50s are reluctant to bow to this pressure to age prematurely and emerging evidence from Britain and abroad suggests many older workers are exploiting the new economy to the full. At the same time, economic imperatives are forcing businesses to reassess their approach to older workers. </p> <p>Crucial to this shift in attitudes is the maturation of the new economy. Organisational change, globalisation and a strongly competitive environment are putting new economy businesses under more pressure than ever before. Internet startups are facing a tougher outlook as the shakeout commences and start up entrepreneurs, shareholders and backers are looking to add wisdom and experience to the management mix. </p> <p>Seasoned campaigners with experience of previous economic cycles are suddenly at a premium in the dot.com sector. Managers who have seen downturns come and go and who have survived the process are in demand. </p> <p>\"Trusted guides\" are emerging as crucial to the success of customer-focused businesses. Increased customer choice has led to customers demanding better advice and businesses are appointing older workers whose age and experience inspires trust. Connectors, or older workers with team building skills, are adding ballast to the lean organisations of the new economy. </p> <p>New economy demand for complex skills is placing older workers in prime position. But doubts remain over the over 50s' willingness to navigate the organisational structure of the new economy. The growth of the organisation as a hub for freelancers and portfolio workers, combined with the death of the traditional career, sounds like a shift in favour of youth. Older people frequently suffered at the hands of the traditional career structure as they were pushed out to make room for younger people at the top. But, ironically, the demise of the job for life improves prospects for older workers. </p> <p>More flexible forms of labour also suit older workers. Over 50s with employment history and a lifetime of contacts are far better placed than younger counterparts to navigate the networked labour market, where freelancing and consultancy are the norm. </p> <p>Even if new economy employers remain unpersuaded by some of the skills staring them in the face, demographic and social changes may force them to reassess their views. Birth rates have been falling since the 1960s, which means that employers can no longer rely on the former standby of youth labour to plug employment gaps. By 2020, the workforce will have 2m fewer under 50s and 2m more over 50s. </p> <p>Meanwhile, health improvements and social changes provide a further riposte to those who argue that older workers cannot make it in the hurly burly of the new economy. Voluntary Services Overseas has reported a four-fold increase in the number of over 50s volunteering to work in the toughest of environments, reflecting the heightened aspirations and physical capabilities of today's over 50s. </p> <p>Better work prospects for older workers are not just wishful thinking. Over the last year, employment rates for the over 50s have grown twice as quickly as for the workforce as a whole. This experience is echoed in Australia, where three quarters of the jobs created over the last four years have gone to the over 45s and in the United States where older workers account for 10% of the workforce but 22% of the nation's job growth. </p> <p>It is time we stopped treating older people as a social, fiscal and employment problem. It is time we ditched the shortsighted worship of youth and re-embraced the values of wisdom and experience. It is time to stop seeing age as an obstacle and start seeing it as an opportunity.

The agency will have an important role to play in establishing our future global brand, enabling Vodafone to achieve its aim of becoming the world's leading mobile multimedia company and ensuring the Group is in pole position when its operating companies launch their third-generation networks.\"</p> <p>BMP and Vodafone had both indicated that a European review would not affect the UK business and it is unclear at this stage if the work created by McCann-Erickson will run in the UK market. </p> <p>Vodafone purchased the German telecoms company Mannesman for \u00a3105bn last year.

  "<p>Last Monday, Andi Peters went on This Morning to plug the start of Celebrity!, the new teatime showbiz programme he's fronting. By Wednesday, Richard and Judy had got their pound of flesh as the undemanding Celebrity! \"took us behind the scenes\" of This Morning. It won't surprise anyone to hear that Celebrity! is made by Carlton. With its reliance on ITV stars (well, it was rustled up in six weeks), it is budget TV, wall-to-wall easy-view plugs and pop videos: a stereotypical Carlton project. </p> <p>Except that that is not the whole story. As Celebrity! was bedding down, Steve Hewlett, Carlton's director of programmes, was in Washington, sealing a deal with Time magazine and the Washington Post to develop factual programming together. (This mirrors an arrangement by Granada with the New York Times.) Stacked by Hewlett's TV set in his Portman Square offices in London's West End are tapes of Britain at War, a follow-up series to the award-winning Second World War in Colour. </p> <p>Celebrity!, warts and all, fits into a larger quest, to build a production business, in volume as well as value terms, after the failed collaboration with OK! magazine. Hewlett has made sure that a seasoned team is in charge, used to making live, daily television. Another department of Carlton Productions is, even now, casting actors for the remake of Crossroads; sets are under construction in the company's Nottingham studios and production starts in December. Landing a daily soap was, Hewlett observes, \"the holy grail\". He tenderly produces a huge box file containing Crossroads scripts and storylines. </p> <p>At 42, Hewlett is a large, shrewd and resilient man, whose past career spans a successful stint as editor of Panorama, and another as head of factual programmes at Channel 4. Delegates at this year's Guardian Edinburgh International Television Festival watched him anchor a key session on Big Brother, forcing Peter Bazalgette to disclose that he was automatically signing up contestants for his talent agency. </p> <p>Lawyers for Richard Desmond, chairman of Northern and Shell, which publishes OK!, have written to Carlton warning it that they will be swelling the audience watching Celebrity! to make sure OK! isn't being ripped off. \"For us it is a fantastic opportunity. ITV is prepared to trust Carlton with a live and daily programme - that's quite a new phenomenon,\" observes Hewlett. \"Richard Desmond is his own man, used to running his own company, and everything jumps to his tune. It's his thing. Television requires a different approach, collaborative. It's harder to be finicky.\" Hewlett then goes off the record to describe some ripe Desmond-style exchanges. </p> <p>Carlton is already locked in a legal dispute with the News of the World, over allegations of fakery on The Cook Report. The strand remains off air while the libel war dance is played out. Hewlett confirms that series editor Mike Morley left the company's employ over the summer, but is still a consultant. </p> <p>Hewlett was recruited to inject gravitas and editorial controls after the disaster of The Connection, a programme that faked drug-trafficking evidence, leading to a record fine from the independent television commission, and no little discredit for the company. \"Those problems are historic, not current,\" insists Hewlett. But what about The Cook Report? \"There was never any suggestion that the audience was misled. The issues are about the way the programme was being run. We are disputing the veracity of what they [the NoW] are saying. </p> <p>\"At its best the programme, and Roger Cook, showed themselves capable of bringing investigative journalism to a wide audience. If we could bring it back, splendid. At the moment, until the News of the World case is resolved, it is in suspended animation. The problem for The Cook Report, although we reject the serious allegations, is that because it delves into areas of criminality, it is always dealing with people who are unreliable. As soon as questions are raised about reliability, it's an open invitation for someone to claim he's been traduced. So it's just not practicable to run it.\" </p> <p> Surely Hewlett's collaborative TV team skills have been tested to the limit since Lord (Waheed) Alli of Planet 24 was brought into Carlton 18 months ago, seemingly to do the same job? \"I'm not going to say it wasn't a bit difficult at first. It was. Partly because at that time I was only six months into what you can see the results of. I'm director of programmes, part of Carlton Television. I report to Waheed. When you look at the production division, out of a turnover of \u00a3140m, \u00a3120m of it is here with me.\" </p> <p>So Hewlett has nothing to do with The Big Breakfast? \"It's run as separate companies. Planet 24 [now a wholly owned subsidiary of Carlton] doesn't report to me. Going forward, who knows? Anyway, the point is, there were difficult moments in the beginning. The reason it was a bit tricky is that in the end we were saying the same thing, and both trying to create a vibrant in-house talent base. </p> <p>\"At the launch of The Railway Children, Waheed was host. But the celebrity launch of World War Two in Colour - I'll host that. These things are never easy, but in the fundamentals, there is some evidence that we are succeeding. In a curious way our skills are complementary. </p> <p>\"I'm used to working in big organisations. I have broader, longer and more direct production experience. And I'm plugged into genres that he has no knowledge of. Whereas in entertainment, in dealing with talent, he's pretty plugged in.\" </p> <p>Carlton is also making the UK version of Survivor, the reality gameshow that has taken the US by storm. The format was devised by Alli and his partner Charlie Parsons, but was not part of the Planet 24 sale to Carlton (according to some accounts of the deal, Carlton chairman Michael Green was dismissive of the show). But for all Alli's showbusiness nous - it was he who fronted the bid to get ITV to commission Crossroads - he is not taking a hand in Celebrity!. </p> <p>Carlton's fundamental problem, as Hewlett sees it, is that it isn't Thames. \"The problem for Carlton, once Michael Green had taken the licence off Thames, was that it was seen as part of the whole Thatcher project. Everyone hated them. I don't have that much to do with Michael Green. He's fairly hands-off in terms of the way the business is run; I get a note from him every now and then saying 'I really enjoyed that, thanks very much.'\" </p> <p>Carlton, he adds, was set up on a fundamentally flawed concept, as a publisher/broadcaster. \"It seemed like a brilliant idea at the time. Except why should independent producers bother with a TV franchise holder when they could go direct to the ITV network centre\". Or anywhere else. The abiding truth seems to be that \"content is king\", especially in the new media. Between 1994 and 1999, Carlton, by now buttressed by the takeover of Central, saw a 45% decline in its production business. In addition what was Central Productions, with a great tradition in a wide range of programming, just withered in the hands of centralised management. Last year Carlton accounted for 13% of network programmes, while the Granada bulldozer made 50%. The danger now is that Carlton, loser in the TV merger game, will itself wither as a minor player in ITV. </p> <p>\"I don't accept that,\" argues Hewlett. \"Carlton has the two biggest, most lucrative licences, and can't be messed around with. We intend to proceed in the spirit of partnership. The merger doesn't disadvantage us, though it is unsettling. In production we didn't get over-panicked - these people here are sufficiently good to have a future. ITV needs programmes and the ones we make. The production businesses really are separate from broadcasting,\" he says. </p> <p>Behind the scenes, adds Hewlett, there has been a big reorganisation at Carlton in the past two years, to separate out production. \"I inherited a commissioning structure. We've transformed it to a production centre.\" </p> <p>In-house production is shooting up: Barbara, Big Bad World, The Vice, Peak Practice, now up to 26 episodes a year (and discussing a further increase with ITV network centre). But there is a downside: Carlton declined to go on making Monsignor Renard, a John Thaw star vehicle, because, at a cost of \u00a32m an episode (not fully paid back by ITV), it was losing money without hefty guaranteed overseas sales. It marked the point when Alli was cracking the boss's whip. </p> <p>Hewlett says his key input was to hire the right people to turn around Carlton's image. \"Factual programmes, in my view, were desperate for the credibility.\" He pays tribute to Polly Bide, Carlton's controller of factual programmes: \"She's fantastically sure-footed in matters of editorial.\" He points to the two episodes of Horizon made for the BBC, a new series for Channel 4 and Discovery's Learning Channel, Hell in the Pacific, marking the anniversary of Pearl Harbor. </p> <p>\"In terms of Carlton's image and appearance, these programmes are absolutely vital. What most people thought was wrong with Carlton related to its factual programmes.\" </p> <p>Equally, with around 250 people now working in Carlton Productions you can see how the incentive to stick around, and work with Alli, is real enough.</p>",

  "<p>Requiescat in pace, Aura. Go gentle into that good night, Men's Quest. James Brown's Hotdog? Not exactly sizzling off the shelves. IPC's Nova has been newsworthy more for the activity in its staff departure lounge than for soaraway success. And the BBC's Eve might need more than a fig leaf if rumours of early sales figures are true. </p> <p>Why, then, is Cabal Communications trying to buck the trend with Mondo, our new magazine to be launched on Wednesday? As the lifestyle magazine for the global hedonist (it will be racked on the stands with the men's titles), we believe we have an idea whose time has come - bear market or not. More practically, as publishers of Real Homes and Front - whose improving circulations stand in contrast to the bumpier ride endured by much of our competition despite their deeper pockets, we believe we know how to reach and keep the flesh-and-blood readers who lie behind the zeitgeist. </p> <p>No idea, however inspired, succeeds purely on its own merit - or its creators' self-belief. When Cabal started in 1998, the pressure was on to launch high-circulation titles as quickly as possible, knowing that months of advertising forward bookings would have to be sacrificed to the urgent necessity of establishing to the whole industry our credibility as a publisher of reader-friendly magazines. So it proved, although today's much healthier advertising revenues - up 100% year on year - suggest what might have been achieved had Front and Real Homes spent six months present ing to the advertising industry before launch. </p> <p>But, with Mondo, Cabal could afford to take its time to tune the launch of a radically different magazine proposition with a hitherto untargeted upscale potential readership. It is fully 14 months since its inventors, editor Push and deputy editor Mark Wernham, quit their successful careers on the IPC magazines Muzik and Melody Maker in order to develop the Mondo concept with fellow IPC renegade Sally O'Sullivan (our proprietress who, along with Front's editor Piers Hernu, stole every scene in BBC2's four-part documentary on Cabal broadcast earlier this year). </p> <p>For Push and Wernham, Mondo realises a dream. For O'Sullivan it is a magazine that not only adds to Cabal's strength in the male lifestyle market, but is a proposition that only a publisher with its tuned-in talent pool and lack of costly corporate impedimenta could achieve efficiently and without the fatal dilution that afflicts so many launches by big magazine combines. Think Later. Think Heat. Think of numerous short-lived titles published to fill a perceived gap in the market or protect a cash-cow title. </p> <p>By early spring, Push, Wernham and Cabal's advertising director, Mark Lonergan, had their pitch to the advertising industry polished to a high gleam, and Mondo's launch was scheduled for May. But two months before the due date, we switched the light from green to amber. Why? Firstly, Push collapsed and had to be hospitalised with a serious kidney complaint. Secondly, display space on the news-stands was at a premium in May due to intense promotional activity by our competitors, and Mondo could not be guaranteed the visibility on the shelves that is vital to any consumer magazine launch. </p> <p>Now, in October, we have plenty of prime shelf-space and an editor who is pursuing a slightly healthier lifestyle. In the weeks to come we at Cabal will see how well Mondo can swim. Being talked about in the right places should help. With its unapologetically libertarian, pleasure-seeking agenda and appeal to all those who have ever turned on, tuned in and gone travelling, tongues will wag. Furthermore, unlike existing male lifestyle magazines, Mondo is not a bunker to protect bruised male self-esteem. It does not hang a sign saying \"Girls keep out\". Addressing itself to self-confident, adventurous men, it will also provide a clubhouse for women who like to walk on the wild side. </p> <p>And being seen in the right places should prove the clincher. Mondo's launch strategy is geared to high visibility where it ultimately matters - at point of sale. From there, we believe that once we get the magazine into the hands of the intrigued or even mildly curious, its quality will convert the impulse buy into a habit. And then into a readership. And then into a brand. Watch this space, playmates.</p> <p> \u0095 Mat Snow is editorial director of Mondo</p>",
  "<p>Friday's announcement of a link-up between US film giant Universal and cable operator NTL typifies the market for digital television in the UK: everyone wants a piece. The list of players involved is a who's who of media big hitters. NTL is linked to BSkyB, which is linked to French media giant Vivendi, which is linked to Universal. A winter of manoeuvring is approaching and the question on everyone's lips is, will this circle of convenience hold? </p> <p>The NTL and Universal channel is to be called The Studio, combining the UK's largest broadband company with a major Hollywood studio which has a catalogue of blockbusters including The Mummy, Notting Hill and Babe. It's an intimidating team, and sends out the message to Sky, the dominant player in UK digital TV, that the opposition are finally getting their act together. </p> <p>The deal is open to NTL subscribers at basic tier entry-level at no extra cost, and will be available on all platforms when it launches in the next six months. It is therefore not a premium channel, unlike Sky's movie offerings, and the considerable Universal archive will give it added appeal. </p> <p>NTL denies it is an aggressive move, pointing out that it recently signed a five-year carriage deal with BSkyB, which is owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation. Its unexpected anxiety about staying onside with Sky relates as much to the other key pay-TV content, football, as it does to the new battleground of Hollywood movies. </p> <p>Both NTL and Sky hold stakes in several Premier League clubs, both own a slug of the next season's pay-TV screening rights, NTL on pay-per-view matches, Sky on basic. The arrangement between the two is expected to lead to pay-per-view football channels. For the moment, at least, they are allies. Steve Wagner, managing director of NTL, says: \"I speak to BSkyB all the time and they understand what we are doing. We are trying to change the economics of the digital business, to let consumers benefit. If consumers benefit, then BSkyB will do even better. This is a win and win situation.\" </p> <p>Wagner adds that The Studio has been offered to Sky Digital, though no deal has been concluded. Analysts point out that NTL has committed millions of pounds every year to marketing Sky's premium channels, including its movie package, as part of the carriage deal. But NTL saw the potential in Universal's offer and is obviously itching to get its hands on exclusive content and stop Sky from surging ahead. </p> <p>\"Universal and NTL are trying to set up a basic movie channel and see if it works,\" says one analyst. \"Sky will want to see how long they can wait to carry it, which will be interesting to watch, though they will certainly carry it eventually.\" </p> <p>NTL knows it has to get its skates on. Sky has 4.5m subscribers, of whom 80% receive a digital service, while NTL has a target of just 500,000 subscribers by the end of the year. But it should not feel too self-conscious - as the third player in the digital market, ONdigital, co-owned by ITV big hitters Carlton and Granada, only has 750,000 users. </p> <p>NTL's trump card is its cable coverage. Since snapping up telecoms company Cable &amp; Wireless, its broadband network has the capacity to reach 12m homes. If this distribution platform can be married to content - and there must be more joint ventures in the broadband pipeline - then Sky will be looking over its shoulder on a more regular basis. </p> <p>And Sky's streak into the distance has come at a cost. Moody's Investors Service, a major credit rating agency, recently downgraded the debt rating of Sky due to a \"continuing weakness in the company's financial profile\". Its aggressive push into the digital market has seen its debts soar from \u00a3665m in June 1999 to \u00a31.1bn 12 months later. However, Sky insists that analogue television can be switched off by 2006, and if it stays ahead of the competition, it will reap the benefits. </p> <p>But the key - and still somewhat shadowy - figure in the NTL and Universal agreement is Vivendi, the French media conglomerate. Vivendi is in the process of securing European Commission approval of its \u00a323bn merger with Seagram of Canada, which owns Universal Studios and Universal Music. The upshot is that very, very quietly - there is not a mention of Vivendi or its pay-TV giant Canal Plus on the press release - last week's deal suddenly puts the company nose-to-nose with Sky. </p> <p>Eyebrows are raised in Isleworth because Vivendi holds a 25% stake in Sky, yet has decided to launch The Studio with another operator. Even though Universal is technically not yet part of Vivendi, it is known that the French company has encouraged the deal all the way. </p> <p>So why fly in the face of Murdoch? The answer lies with Jean-Marie Messier, the Vivendi chairman, who is determined to make inroads into the UK market. His first steps have been made with the multiple-access internet portal Vizzavi, which has been soft-launched in the UK with mobile phone operator Vodafone, but that is just the tip of the iceberg. </p> <p>Messier wants access to the digital market not just here but all over the world, and, analysts say, he is anxious to do this with Murdoch rather than against him. However, Murdoch has held off from letting Vivendi fold its Sky stake into Sky Global Networks, the soon-to-float umbrella company formed from News Corporation's satellite operations. </p> <p>For the first time, Murdoch is showing signs that he is willing to dilute his family's grip on NewsCorp, as underlined by last week's share-swap with US cable giant Liberty Media. Under the terms of the deal, Liberty took a 4.7% stake in Sky Global and increased its holding in NewsCorp from 7% to 18%. </p> <p>Messier is now waiting for Murdoch to approach his company with an offer and the Australian-born magnate has indicated that he is willing to do so. If Murdoch prevaricates, then Vivendi will continue to take a slice of the UK, and global, digital market by alternative means. </p> <p>A senior observer close to the NTL and Universal deal said last week: \"Sky will be hacked off that the arrangement carries no commitment to them, but it might concentrate their minds towards Vivendi. There is a lot of stuff that they can do together, and a movie channel is the very least they can do. </p> <p>\"That said, if little beginnings can grow to bigger alliances, then they can also lead to bigger bust-ups.\" </p> <p>It is true that the Universal and NTL deal is not an earth-shaker, but the bigger rumblings are sure to come.</p>",
  "<p>\u0095 Sophie Raworth, the pretty half of the BBC's new breakfast team, has caused quite a stir among blue-chip types. Eyebrows were raised at BBC news after she was found to have a website set up by a celebrity stalker. And it gets worse.

  "William Hague last night moved to fend off a renewed bid by moderate One Nation Tories to recapture the soul of their party when he signalled a dramatic plan to create publicly funded, private \"partnership schools\" as a catalyst for reviving neglected inner cities. <p>Hours before the opening of his Bournemouth conference, the Conservative leader will this morning formally unveil his blueprint for setting up \"regeneration companies\" in run-down neighbourhoods as a demonstration of this week's key conference slogan, A Conservative Party for All. </p> <p>The move came after key members of his praetorian guard had been forced to slap down a provocatively timed call by Michael Heseltine for his pro-European ally, Kenneth Clarke, to be recalled to the shadow cabinet - and allowed to go on expressing his dissident views. </p> <p>Calling the exclusion of such a heavy-hitter as \"ludicrous\" Mr Heseltine said Mr Hague should \"make a real concerted effort to bring Ken Clarke back into the shadow cabinet\" and campaign as a \"classic One Nation Conservative\". </p> <p>The timing of the former deputy prime minister's call on the eve of Mr Hague's crucial pre-election party conference was calculated to cause offence, even though Mr Heseltine dressed up his remarks as a constructive contribution to the Tory campaign to win back power at Westminster. </p> <p>Mr Hague's response was unmistakable. Though his inner city spokesman, Archie Norman, had been working for months on a plan for urban regeneration to rival John Prescott's strategy, his aides flagged up this morning's press conference to divert media attention from another damaging split on Europe. </p> <p>Flanked by senior MPs, Mr Hague - whose brief poll lead over Labour has disappeared - will admit: \"Inner city renewal is not normally associated with today's Conservative party\". Poor quality of urban life has accentuated the flight of ambitious, talented people to the suburbs for 30 years, he will say. </p> <p>But his remedy will be controversial. Recognising the need for an outside catalyst to stimulate change Mr Norman has persuaded his old management consultant protege - Mr Hague - to accept public/ private partnerships called \"regeneration companies\" with sweeping powers across health, education and crime, as well as the built environment. </p> <p>Central to their efforts to persuade upwardly mobile families to stay in inner city areas will be education and the prospect of new \"partnership schools\" set up by independent bodies, charities, churches or businesses, but financed with public money. </p> <p>The move took pressure off Michael Ancram, the Conservative chairman, who had been forced to argue that Mr Clarke, the former chancellor, who lost the 1997 leadership contest to Mr Hague, had excluded himself by refusing to accept the policy ruling out UK membership of the eurozone for the next parliament. \"If you are in the shadow cabinet, you accept the collective responsibility of the shadow cabinet line. Those who do not accept it cannot expect to be in the shadow cabinet.\" </p> <p>Mr Heseltine's intervention 24 hours before John Major makes a fresh appeal for One Nation moderation, again underlined the Tory talent for destructive infighting over Europe just as Denmark's No vote on euro-membership is forcing Tony Blair's cabinet to make a tactical retreat on the timing of its euro referendum. </p> <p>To compound the offence, Mr Heseltine, who is stepping down as MP for Henley at the election, suggested to his fellow Tories that they should follow the example of one of their least favourite Labour politicians, the four-time election winner, Harold Wilson. For unity's sake, he allowed seven cabinet leftwingers to campaign for a No vote in the 1975 EU referendum. </p> <p>The Tories arrive in Bournemouth in good heart. But the latest clutch of opinion polls suggest Labour has managed to bounce back from the fuel crisis - and Mr Hague's 8% lead - since ICM put the government ahead again by 38% to 37% and 20% for the Lib Dems. NOP in the Sunday Express gave Labour a 6% lead.</p>",
  "Today the Human Rights Act comes into force. Will anyone cry \"Jack Straw and Liberty!\" or carry Lord Irvine, in full-bottomed wig and britches, in triumph to Mansion House? Alas, the London mob is not what it was when it cheered such defenders of freedom as Lord Erskine, flushed from battling at the Old Bailey with the repressive government of George III. <p>These days, it is more easily mobilised to hunt alleged paedophiles. Whether today will mark an historic legal shift in favour of the liberty of the subject depends on whether the courts apply the new act in the spirit of John Wilkes and Tom Paine, or whether it is interpreted as just another European convention. </p> <p>Of course, the act makes the European Convention of Human Rights enforceable in our own courts, short-circuiting the five-year trek to the European court in Strasbourg. But the convention is not \"European\" in any special sense: it sets forth a list of elemental guarantees, couched in simple English, drawn or elaborated from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. </p> <p>These are principles for which English radicals have fought and died down the centuries, with some monumental successes (habeas corpus, due process, ending the death penalty) and notable failures (blasphemy, sedition, official secrecy). The advent of the Human Rights Act provides the opportunity to reverse these failures, by giving judges new powers to revise the common law (law made by judges) and reinterpret statutes to bring them into conformity with human rights principles. </p> <p>Although old Labour withheld support for a bill of rights on the grounds that judges could not be trusted, there is little doubt that modern judges are up to the task. In the first test case, some were even prepared to upset anti-terrorist legislation because it reversed the burden of proof, that \"golden thread\" of English criminal law. This was a hopeful example of using the act to give full force to an English tradition of fair play. But in the unnecessarily long lead-time between the passage of the act (November 1998) and its operation, a danger has emerged that threatens to dilute its impact. </p> <p>This period has seen the publication of many fat textbooks and innumerable training courses for judges, lawyers and magistrates. These have made the mistake of teaching the act - as if it were a European invention without English ancestry - mainly through the case law of the European court and the now defunct European commission. </p> <p>This has served to obscure the richness of our own history as a source of inspirational interpretation. And it treats with too much respect a body of European jurisprudence that is cautious, sometimes reactionary, often cast in unhelpful generalities and worst of all, expressed in direst Europrose. </p> <p>Instead of trying to apply such slippery precedents, our courts must recognise their limits. Strasbourg judges have been treading warily, anxious not to disturb national governments unduly. They have sometimes fudged important principles with \"balancing exercises\" or by allowing to states a \"margin of appreciation\" to infringe the liberty of their citizens in the interests, for example, of public order or the Catholic church. </p> <p>Decisions emanating from a full chamber of 21 judges tend to be intellectually simplistic, while some \"admissibility decisions\" churned out by the European commission in the years before its demise read like law student essays and are simply wrong. Our own courts can do much better than this with the guarantees of the convention, so long as they do not feel obliged to adopt Strasbourg approaches. </p> <p>To locate an authentic British culture of liberty, they should go back to Wilkes and Paine and they should look in particular to the true progenitors of the modern human rights movement - a group of writers and lawyers that formed around HG Wells to draft the first \"universal\" bill of rights in 1939. They included JB Priestley, Viscount Sankey (Labour's first lord chancellor), Barbara Wootton and even AA Milne, who motored up from Pooh Corner for the meetings to forge a set of written guarantees against the onslaught of fascism. </p> <p>Their language (\"there shall be no secret dossiers kept in any government department..an Englishman's home and reasonably limited garden enclosure is his castle\") may be dated, but its spirit should infuse interpretations of the Human Rights Act. Their work, published as a Penguin Special in 1940, inspired Roosevelt's \"Four Freedoms\" speech and was one of the models for the Universal Declaration (which was in turn the model for the European convention) but has been forgotten by the textbooks and training materials. </p> <p>The Human Rights Act will feature in a lot of litigation, although it will mostly be used to support decisions that the courts would have reached in any event. It will make a real difference, however, if it is wielded as a weapon to demolish those oppressive common laws under which freethinkers have suffered in the past. Will it mean the end of the laws of blasphemy and criminal libel and sedition? If so, the Human Rights Act will be important not only to lawyers, but to humans as well. </p> <p>Geoffrey Robertson QC is author of Crimes Against Humanity: the Struggle for Global Justice, published by Penguin. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>There is one global index which, despite its Dow Jones parentage and the presence of Microsoft, Exxon and other leading American companies at the top of most league tables, is dominated by European rather than US companies. </p> <p>The Dow Jones sustainability index, which celebrates its first birthday this week, aims to identify the world's most responsible companies. They are the ones, out of the 2,000 members of the Dow Jones global indices, judged to be ahead on social, environmental and economic criteria.</p> <p>In the changes to the index which come into effect on Friday two British companies have leapt to the top of their sectors. They are BG Group, soon to be split in two, and Thames Water, which is being acquired by the German group RWE. On the other hand Unilever has been ousted by one of the few US winners - its rival, Procter &amp; Gamble.</p> <p>Apart from BG and Thames Water, others among the 30 British representatives include recognised environmental leaders such as Anglian Water, BAA, British Airways, BT and Sainsbury.</p> <p>The analysis by Sustainable Asset Management (SAM), an asset management firm in Switzerland, is not based on individual incidents. The researchers look at strategy and management systems across the three categories of economic, environmental and social impacts. They examine risks and opportunities, looking for firms which are well placed to avoid environmental disasters, for example, and to capitalise on community involvement.</p> <p>SAM says BG is a clear leader in all three fields. It praises the gas company's thoroughness in environmental management and cites its establishment of the BG Foundation in the social sphere.</p> <p>Thames Water is praised for its approach to employee health and safety and its communication of environmental targets and policies.</p> <p>The new league table includes 236 companies from 27 countries, worth a total of $5.5 trillion (\u00a33.8 trillion). The US contributes 51 companies, including Dell and Intel but not Microsoft. In total the Americas constitute almost 44% of the index, marginally less than Europe, with the final 12% coming from Asia. These companies are the top 10% of their respective sectors, according to SAM's research.</p> <p>The purpose of the index is to give investors a means of buying into the world's sustainable business leaders. But from the investment point of view that is of no use unless they deliver financial returns as well as good social and environmental performance. So far, that is the case.</p> <p>In its first year the index performed marginally less well than the DJ global index from which it is drawn - 59.2% growth against 60%, but that was mainly because of the weak euro. Calculated over the past five years the sustainable companies' share prices grew 241% against 174% for the global basket. All the other figures are in favour of the new index - nearly 15% return on equity (from less than 10%), higher earnings growth leading to higher price-earnings ratios but also slightly higher dividend yields.</p> <p>Not that many investors have been attracted so far, however. Only 17 licences to use the index have been taken up to date, all in Europe. In Britain the sole licensee is Bear Stearns, with a capital guarantee note based on the index.</p> <p>The \"best in class\" approach - buying the best companies in each sector - is still a fairly novel development from the ethical investment tradition of avoiding poor companies or sectors.</p> <p>In Britain last year's ethical pension legislation has accelerated interest in positive discrimination, because trustees are keen not to limit the total potential investment population. But the preference of those funds which have addressed ethical issues has been for \"engagement\" - continuing to invest according to financial criteria but pressing those companies to improve their social and environmental performance.</p> <p>Mark Mansley of Claros Consulting, who advises on socially responsible investment, said: \"I have slightly mixed feelings about it.</p> <p>\"There is no engagement and it amounts to taking an active position on sustainable development and quite a passive position on financial performance.\"</p> <p>However, with pension funds slowly coming to terms with the requirement to confront ethical issues, next year's index could see more British takers.</p>",
  "<p>BT yesterday denied reports that chairman Sir Iain Vallance would step down before his contract expires at the end of July 2002. </p> <p>The company issued an official denial to counter the growing speculation surrounding BT's senior management team. BT is coming under unprecedented levels of criticism from all sides, including investors, rivals, the regulator and government - leading some observers to suggest that changes in the boardroom are becoming inevitable. </p> <p>Shares in the company closed a further 24p lower at 711p on Friday against the \u00a315.13p peak they reached at the beginning of the year. </p> <p>Two separate reports yesterday suggested Sir Iain would step down, one saying he would leave in January and the other in July 2001. He has been in the job since 1987. </p> <p>The company is going through a period of profound change and is in talks with US telecoms firm AT&amp;T about various ways of combining their businesses. It is also expected to announce the flotation of its global wireless division shortly in part to help pay down its \u00a330bn debt mountain. </p> <p>At home, BT is facing the break up of its local telephone monopoly but has been accused of dragging its heels and obstructing the process.</p>",
  "A novel weapon in the global war against heroin, a fungus that destroys opium poppies, might lead to an ecological disaster, scientists fear. <p>Britain and the United States are funding researchers in Uzbekistan to work on the biological weapon, which they claim could lay waste to millions of opium poppies in central Asia. </p> <p>But a BBC Panorama investigation tonight will allege that the safety of the project, set up in 1998 under the United Nations drug control programme and overseen by a British scientist, is causing concern. </p> <p>Confidential documents from the UN, seen by Panorama, show the organisation has anxieties about the safety of the project. The documents highlight the possibility that once the fungus is spread on poppy fields, such as those of neighbouring Afghanistan, the source of 90% of Britain's illegal heroin, it might be difficult to contain. </p> <p>There is also concern that the fungus may mutate, or be used on food crops in offensive biological warfare. </p> <p>In field trials the virulent strain of Pleospora papaveracea, described as \"aggressive, infectious, self-propagating and deadly\", caused opium poppies to wilt and die while apparently leaving neighbouring crops unharmed. </p> <p>At the institute of plant genetics in Tashkent, Panorama discovered that some of the fungus had been prepared with talc and silica gel to make it capable of being sprayed from a plane. </p> <p>The Uzbek scientists at the institute, a former germ warfare plant, estimated the fungus would be ready for regular use within three years. </p> <p>Abdukarimov Abdusattar, the molecular biologist in charge of the institute, admitted there was a possibility of dangerous mutation of the fungus. </p> <p>He also revealed that he planned to use X-rays to encourage mutations in an attempt to produce even more virulent forms - a form of genetic engineering with unpredictable results. </p> <p>The programme suggests that, by opening a Pandora's box of genetic modifications such as this, the project would \"touch the edge of biological warfare\". </p> <p>Environmentalists warned of the risk of an ecological catastrophe if Pleospora were used. </p> <p>A British plant pathologist , Paul Rogers,said: \"The fungus sounds like a silver bullet, but it could easily become a poisoned chalice. </p> <p>\"Once you develop a technology to spread plant diseases intentionally you are developing a technology which could easily be misused by bad people against legitimate food crops.\" </p> <p>He added: \"If things drift into the private sector, then who are the paymasters? You are simply opening things out for a wider spread of this kind of technology.\" </p> <p>Professor Rogers also pointed out that there would be a further risk if the fungus were used to wipe out illicit drug harvests: \"Drug cartels could themselves acquire the technology and in revenge attacks use a form of agricultural terrorism against Britain or the US.\" </p> <p>He urged caution: \"I think that Britain should be extremely careful about a project like this. While it appears to offer a great prospect, the dangers are very considerable. I think that it is a path that you tread with great care and great caution.\" </p> <p>Despite such warnings, tests on the microbe have proved so successful that Mike Greaves, a British microbiologist overseeing the project for the UN, said that he believed it could provide the key to reducing the illicit drug harvests of the world. </p> <p>\"I love it. It's actually working. Many research projects don't work, and you get rather frustrated. This one is working on all levels,\" he said. </p> <p>Commenting on the risks, he added: \"We are still working on the safety aspects to be absolutely sure. You will appreciate that, in any sphere, whether it's science or public transport or any aspect of human life, you can never say that we are 100% safe.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Britain's Secret War on Drugs, tonight at 10pm on BBC1.</p>",
  "Like lovers forced to part, the Olympic movement and Sydney shared one long, lingering embrace last night before saying farewell. This has only been a 16-day romance, but it has been a peculiarly intense one. And both sides sense that life is never going to be this good again. <p>Just before the flame went out on the 2000 games at the Olympic stadium, Juan Antonio Samaranch, president of the International Olympic Committee, paid tribute to Sydney for producing \"the best games ever\". This is the traditional accolade handed out at closing ceremonies - until 1996, when Samaranch pointedly withheld it as a response to the multiple cock-ups of Atlanta. </p> <p>This time he added: \"They could not have been better\" and thanked Michael Knight, the New South Wales Olympics minister, for producing \"a perfect organisation\". </p> <p>This summed up a mood of almost rampant amity and self-congratulation. Only the American TV network, NBC, stuffed out of sight by the huge time difference, has failed to relish these games. An Olympics in which everything seemed to work concluded in the same vein with an impressive and enjoyable (if under-edited) closing ceremony, climaxing with a fireworks display centred on the Harbour bridge. Naturally, this was sensational - even for a city that was already considered the global pyrotechnic HQ. </p> <p>The success of Sydney, however, creates problems for future Olympic hosts. Concern about the progress in Athens, the venue for 2004, is already starting to move from concern to alarm, if not yet panic. There are even far-fetched rumours that Manchester, which is building quasi-Olympic facilities for the 2002 Commonwealth Games, could be asked to step in. With Beijing favourite to get the 2008 games, the chances of anyone reproducing Sydney's mix of efficiency and enjoyment in the near future seem close to zero. </p> <p>Sydney even managed to incorporate self-deprecation. \"Roy and HG\", the TV hosts who made Fatso the Fat-arsed Wombat a more successful Olympic icon than any of the official souvenirs, were brought in to the closing ceremony. They shared the occasion with the handful of well-known Australians who had not been chosen for opening night. These included Paul Hogan, Kylie Minogue, Greg Norman and about 60 Sydney drag queens. In one very nice touch, John Wing was introduced. In 1956, he was a schoolboy who wrote to the organisers and suggested that the closing ceremony should consist of informal mingling rather than formal marching. This idea was accepted and has been a tradition ever since. </p> <p><b> Sense of achievement</b><br> </p> <p> The sense of achievement and well-being extended to corners no one could have expected in advance. The final day of competition produced two more gold medals for Britain: from the heavyweight boxer, Audley Harrison, and Stephanie Cook in the inaugural women's modern pentathlon event. This took the total to 11, equal to the combined haul at the three previous Olympics: five at both Barcelona and Seoul, plus one at Atlanta four years ago. </p> <p>By the end, Britain's Olympians could hardly stop themselves. The marathon runner Jon Brown, who did not even rate a mention in pre-race speculation, came within seven seconds of a bronze medal to wrap up the country's most successful games in 80 years. </p> <p>The 11 golds outstripped the total of nine from the Chariots of Fire Olympics of 1924 and rank behind only the 14 at Antwerp in 1920 and 56 in 1908, when Britain had home advantage and most of the potential rivals had the decency not to turn up. </p> <p>There were also 10 silver and seven bronze this time. This is the first time since 1908 that Britain has put aside its historic attachment to finishing second and won more gold than silver. British officials are astounded at their team's performance. \"We didn't have a target for gold medals here,\" said Simon Clegg, the British chef de mission. \"Some of us had private hopes but, whatever they were, we've exceeded them.\" </p> <p>These figures will be seen as an overwhelming justification of the improved funding for British sport since the introduction of national lottery money, and will lead to pressure for more handouts. \"We're just seeing the roots of recovery,\" said Clegg. \"British sport has been under-funded for years, but that's changing.\" </p> <p>Nonetheless, it is impossible to imagine Britain ever matching Australia in organisational terms. Visitors have been left awestruck by the efficiency and national effort that have characterised the Sydney games. Even the rail system has been almost faultless. The idea that British train companies - in 2004 or 2040 - could move the numbers that have been shifted here every day is laughable. </p> <p>But much of the secret has been in the efforts of the volunteers, whose efficiency, courtesy, knowledge and kindness have been a breathtaking feature of these games. One of the Sydney Sunday papers listed them all yesterday under the heading 47,000 HEROES, from Aadil, Naseem to Zylstra, Warren. Until this week, Athens planned to have only paid staff. Adverts for helpers are now being placed. </p> <p>For many, the sense of being part of this great enterprise may well never be re-created. Counselling organisations are expecting a surge in calls from people who feel suddenly bereft at the loss of purpose. Sports psychologist George Shilling warned: \"The effect could be like the end of the second world war. There's the high emotion, then the realisation that we've got to get on with life.\" </p> <p><b> Gains and losses</b><br> </p> <p> The real gains and losses for Sydney will take years to assess. The Australian Financial Review predicts that the Olympics will have virtually no effect on the New South Wales economy, and that the frenzy of Olympic investment has merely replaced other activity. </p> <p>But the Olympics can transform countries as well as cities. The games changed the global perceptions of Japan (1964) and South Korea (1988). Los Angeles (1984) helped the US regain the confidence it lost in Vietnam. Barcelona (1992) was turned into a place that attracted global admiration. </p> <p>On the other hand, Montreal (1976) was almost bankrupted, and the world is still laughing at Atlanta (1996). One suspects Sydney's mood of glorious self-confidence that has made these games such a triumph will sustain Australia for years.</p>",
  "As fireworks exploded all around her and the most successful games ever came to a close, the woman charged with staging the next one was still doing her best to reassure us that Athens could match Australia. <p>\"We invited the Olympics to come back home,\" said Gianna Angelopoulous-Daskalaki, the head of the Athens organising committee. \"We promised to provide the best environment for the games. We will keep our word.\" </p> <p>But after three years of delays, Athens has fallen so far behind in Olympic preparations that serious questions are being raised within the International Olympic Committee about whether the 2004 games should be moved. </p> <p>The biggest concern has been over construction. Athens claims 70% of the sports venues are in place - but they claimed that three years ago. Completing the other 30%, including the Olympic village, remains a problem. </p> <p>In Sydney, there has already been talk behind the scenes of who might stage the games should Athens not be able to. </p> <p>\"There is no plan B,\" said Francois Carrard, the director general of the IOC. \"The IOC is absolutely committed to seeing an excellent games in Athens.\" </p> <p>Last March, the IOC president, Juan Antonio Samaranch, described Athens as facing the worst crisis in his 20-year term. He said Athens was stuck on the \"amber light\" and slipping toward the \"red light\" danger zone. </p> <p>All sides agree that significant progress has been made since the appointment of Angelopoulos-Daskalaki, a 45-year-old former MP and wife of the wealthy shipping magnate Theodore Angelopoulos. </p> <p>She has brought in her own team and begun cutting through the bureaucratic tangle, while premier Costas Simitis has assumed governmental responsibility for the games. </p> <p>The Athens organising committee has a budget of $1.7bn, while the government has committed a total of $3.2bn to games-related projects.</p>",
  "Over the last two weeks our athletes have, win or lose, inspired everyone with their Olympian efforts against the stiffest world-class competition - efforts that have been funded to the tune of \u00a380m over the last three years (Olympians must answer the money question, September 30). <p>Compare this with over \u00a3800m spent on the dreadful Millennium Dome. Unlike the dome, which is short-term and London-centric, funding for athletes often leads to benefits for everyone, such as improved swimming facilities. </p> <p>To obtain funding, our teams were asked to set targets for medals to be won (who can possibly predict that?) and those that have failed face possible cuts.

But before we get carried away with the achievements we must recognise that in the medals table we only came fifth out of the EU member states. </p> <p>We have done well, particularly in sports where funding has been targeted and those outside the mainstream. Even our athletics medals were in sideline events rather than the blue riband ones, and it may well be that we should nurture these sidelines rather than put resources into competition with America. We must cherry-pick our events rather than fail in those that now seem beyond us, only supporting exceptional talents in those sports. </p> <p>We can win and enjoy future games with continued lottery funding, but let us target our funds (even if the sports concerned are not thought of as good television) rather than use a scatter-gun.<br> <b>Brian Robinson</b><br> Brentwood, Essex <a href=\"mailto:brirobinson@lineone.net\">brirobinson@lineone.net</a></p> <p>\u0095 It is impossible to compare standards in sport. The medals table is different when seen against populations; it is even more different when seen against facilities and opportunities. Some countries, like Sudan and Ethiopia, have perhaps only one athletics track, one indoor sports hall and one real swimming pool in the whole country. </p> <p>We seem to win in sports which have the best machinery - bikes, canoes, boats and horses. A form of sports fascism will intensify this with the rich sports getting richer and the poor, poorer. At the same time we will not compete properly in those global sports - based on participation numbers - where comparisons could be made: football, basketball, volleyball, handball and running.
