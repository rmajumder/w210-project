  "<p>It's a weekday, it's gone six and you feel the tough times have been had. But the day isn't over yet. Still on the cards is that compulsory evening trip to the pub. Sounds appealing - but there's a catch. What lies in wait is an evening consisting not of merriment, but of work. </p> <p>The trend to move work into a new arena has made ground in recent years, engulfing bars as well as eateries in the affluent business economy. Sometimes enjoyable, sometimes masquerading as so, our working hours are being stretched ever further by week night drinking. The thinking behind an after hours pint with your workmates and clients is, of course, that it works wonders for the company. </p> <p>Geoff Lowe, a health psychologist at Hull University, has researched the social benefits of sneaking in the odd beverage. \"We've been looking at what it is people get up to when they drink, and one of the things is that there is always laughter. In social drinking there's usually plenty of laughter and relaxation, which is a lot better for your work and health than the tension, pressure, bitterness and back-biting that everyone's used to these days.\" </p> <p>Pubs and bars can level the playing field, iron out the sometimes rigid structure of the office. It is a situation where personalities shine through, hierarchies are quashed and where office politics comes a dull second to the welcoming sight of a hard-earned pint. \"It does kind of change the atmosphere,\" says Bridget Hogg, an occupational psychologist. \"Once you get to know each other in a social environment it brings you to a different level at work. There tends to be a bit more empathy back in the office, and you get deeper working relationships as a result.\" </p> <p>As a workplace strategy or policy it's unlikely to be cast in stone, but office drinks organised by the powers-that-be will undoubtedly have an ulterior motive. Andrew Sampson, an account manager at a London advertising company, relays a recent instance when he was virtually forced out of the office and into the pub with his colleagues. \"We were all put on a project together where we were supposed to be mentoring new recruits around the firm. Then somebody realised that hardly any of the mentors knew each other, so before we started working on anything we all got sent out for a drink together.\" The drink was harmless enough, but the fact that it encroached on his own time, he admits, \"was a bit of a pain\". </p> <p>UBS Warburg is another company that rates the practice. Jeff Lubin, the managing director of European high yield, boasts that taking his team out for food and drinks is \"conducive to breeding trust and loyalty\". </p> <p>Even those who spend their working days surrounded by booze don't rule out the value of a good drink in a social setting. Peter Richnell, the owner of the Havelock Tavern in Olympia, recently took his staff on a day out to the beach \"to get plastered and have a good time\". </p> <p>\"I don't set out to make them interact and play games to sort out their differences, they just do it,\" he says. \"I don't know whether it's because of the trips, but it does help people get on more and I do tend to have quite a loyal set of staff for someone in the pub business.\" </p> <p>It is Britain's renowned pub culture that leaves us somewhat out on a limb compared to the drinking habits of the rest of Europe. Penny Brown, a neuroscientist who worked in Germany for a year, describes how she barely socialised with colleagues outside her lab. \"It's not like being in England,\" she says, \"It's not that the Germans were unfriendly but nobody ever suggested we go out. And the one time we did go to a bar together they thought we drank a hell of a lot. During the week they'd be more inclined to have one drink which would last them all evening. They save the heavy drinking for their festivals where they completely let their hair down and go the other way.\" </p> <p>Foreign nationals based in the UK find our imbibing habits equally perplexing. Christian Lengelle is a Frenchman who works at Credit Lyonnais in London. \"It's a different culture over here. French people are just not used to drinking so much after work.\" He argues that, while British partners are accepting of the late nights that follow an evening's drinks with colleagues and clients, French relationships are not so forgiving. \"French expats will say they just can't do it. They won't even try to negotiate with their wives.\" </p> <p>Nevertheless, he has grown to welcome this little nuance of British working culture with open arms. \"It's more of a casual way of doing business. You can lose the shirt and tie and it all becomes a bit more entertaining. I quite like it like that.\" As do the many other city dwellers who make their way to the hundreds of accommodating bars and pubs that continue to spring up around our working establishments. All of which leaves the non-drinker feeling like a bit of a party pooper if they're always left saying no to an after hours quickie. </p> <p>\"In some situations where work people are expected to go out drinking there's that element of pressure to look out for,\" says Lowe. \"You'll find people start getting concerned that if they don't go they'll miss something, or that the others might be talking about them. So there's the negative aspects to drinking as well.\" </p> <p>All of which rings true for teetotaller Mark Solon, who gave up drinking in moral support of his wife when she became pregnant. As a result he experiences \"a little frisson when clients ask for a gin and tonic and I have to order a mineral water\". Likewise, he was left out during his legal training firm's annual outing to Dublin. When the rest of the staff left at 11pm for their big night out, Solon said his goodbyes and went to bed. \"I missed out because I wasn't part of that drinking attitude any more,\" he says. \"I suppose the ultimate effect of stopping drinking is you're excluded from the stories and therefore excluded from the group.\" When asked about his drinking plans after the birth of his child, Solon admits that it is likely to be the end of his nine-month fast. \"A strong drink will probably be in order.\" </p> <p>But as Lowe points out, the benefits of drinking with your work pals are not unconditionally attached to guzzling the odd pint or short. \"The social aspects add up to more than the alcohol itself. If the socialisation can only occur in the context of drinking well, that's better than nothing. But people can be out with their workmates, have a lemonade and reap all the benefits without even risking a hangover.\"</p>",
  "<p>The eyes of the global oil markets will be on Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia when he takes the rostrum at the United Nations millennium summit in New York today. Dealers will be scrutinising every word to see whether the world's biggest producer is prepared to open the taps and pump enough oil to bring down the price of a barrel of crude, which is running at more than $32 - the highest level since Iraq invaded Kuwait 10 years ago. </p> <p>With dearer fuel pushing up inflation in Europe and casting a shadow over the US presidential elections, the west is hoping that the Saudis will turn up at next week's meeting of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) in Vienna with a plan that will persuade the more hawkish members of the 11-nation cartel to join an agreement that would allow higher production. </p> <p>America has been putting most of the pressure on Opec to raise production but the European Union is concerned enough to float the idea of a world competition authority which would bust the cartel apart. </p> <p>The signs that Opec will relent and raise production are not good. Although the Saudi oil sheiks have always been a moderating influence in Opec - even during the two oil shocks of the 70s - they are reluctant to be seen as poodles of the United States. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the president of Opec, the Venezuelan energy minister Ali Rodriguez, has been touring the world's oil producing countries pushing the case for keeping prices at current levels. In a world that is witnessing an ever bigger gulf between rich and poor, Venezuela's president, Hugo Chavez, said last month: \"We don't want prices to drop below their present level. Lower prices would be like passing a death sentence on ourselves and our people.\" </p> <p><strong> Global demand</strong><br> </p> <p>Venezuela - and some other Opec members - say the west should take some responsibility for the high price consumers pay at the pump, and that rich nations could blunt the impact of rising crude if their finance ministries chose to be less greedy. In the wealthy countries that make up the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, fuel duties account for 60% of the pump price while crude oil accounts for just 12%. Environmentalists, who support higher duties, point out that very little of the revenue raised from fuel duties has found its way into investment in the development of new and clean energy. </p> <p>The economic reasons for rising oil prices are simple. Global demand has picked up since the devaluation in Brazil in early 1999 marked the end of the financial crisis that started in Thailand 18 months earlier. America has defied the gloomy pundits, European growth has been robust and even Japan has shown some signs of emerging from its 10-year period in the doldrums. At the same time, Opec - while by no means the force it was when it brought an end to the long post-war boom with a fivefold increase in oil prices in 1973 - was forced by the dramatic slide in the cost of crude to less than $10 a barrel to stitch together a deal limiting supply. It has chosen its moment well, with stocks in the US at historically low levels. Stronger demand plus restricted supply equal higher prices. </p> <p>The question is: how high can they go? Insiders say talk of prices hitting $40 or even $50 a barrel over the next few months is alarmist, and that any efforts by Opec to hurt the west would be self-defeating, triggering a recession that would lead to another collapse in oil prices. </p> <p>The Saudis are warning their fellow cartel members that higher prices only encourage non-Opec members to explore for new reserves which reduce prices, and Opec's market share. Should the more militant members of Opec try to force Saudi Arabia into adopting a more aggressive stance, there would be a real prospect of the cartel breaking up. </p> <p>On the other hand, there seems little prospect that prices will ease back towards the $25 a barrel benchmark favoured by Riyadh even if Saudi Arabia - the only Opec member with significant spare capacity - achieves a small production increase. The emergence of big non-Opec oil producers such as Russia and Norway does not alter the demand-supply position because Norway has no spare capacity and the Russians are incapable of pumping any extra oil because of the ramshackle state of their industry. </p> <p>The concern in the west is that Opec could do in 2000 what it did in 1973 and trigger a big recession in the industrialised world. Already, it has helped push inflation in the 11 countries of the euro zone above its ceiling of 2% and prompted the European Central Bank to raise interest rates, a move that might take the momentum out of Europe's recovery. </p> <p>French fishermen have already shown what they think of the rising price of diesel by blockading Channel ports in protest, with the queues of boats as potent an image of the impact of rising prices as the footage of motorists queueing at the pumps in the 70s. </p> <p>The world has changed since 1973 and the west is much less dependent on oil than it was a quarter of a century ago. There are some economists who believe that higher oil prices are just what the doctor ordered, because they will provide the sort of check on the booming US economy that has not been forthcoming from Alan Greenspan at the Federal Reserve. But as the price creeps up, nerves in Frankfurt, Tokyo and Washington have started to jangle. For some policymakers, it all seems worryingly familiar.</p>",
  "<p>Swiss luxury watchmaker Tag Heuer has moved its global advertising account out of Bartle Bogle Hegarty and into BDDP/TBWA in Paris.</p> <p>The appointment renews a longstanding relationship between the two companies.

  "<p>The creation of an elite cadre of research universities running exclusive training courses for postgraduates in the sciences moved one step closer last week.</p> <p>Government funding chiefs are proposing that academic departments pass new standard minimum criteria before receiving grants for running PhD and Masters courses. It is the latest in a series of reforms planned by research councils and higher education funding councils all likely to have the same impact on postgraduate training: skewing increasingly scarce resources to fewer departments.</p> <p>As part of its fundamental review of research policy and funding, the Higher Education Funding Council for England rejected earlier calls to simply concentrate postgraduate funding on those academic centres rated most highly for research. Instead, it now proposes that before receiving grants, departments will have to meet minimum training requirements, in particular showing that they have the facilities needed for scientific training.</p> <p>This is still likely to lead to concentration of postgraduate resources by stealth. \"We think it likely that many university departments currently receiving postgraduate funding would not alone be able to satisfy all of the requirements - for example the requirement to provide exposure to a research environment of the highest international quality,\" the report says.</p> <p>The council proposes collaborative arrangements, which might be physical or virtual, and join departments in the same discipline or in the same region. \"These would allow lower scoring departments to train postgraduate research students,\" it says.</p> <p>The move is part of a growing recognition among government funding agencies of the importance of career development and training among postgraduate students. For many years the treatment of postgraduates has been a low priority for academic and government leaders. But now the production of trained scientists is seen as a key factor in the future survival of universities and high-tech businesses in the UK. A clear signal of the sea change in attitudes was the announcement of increased personal stipends for PhD students as part of the conclusions of the government's spending review this summer.</p> <p>The numbers of postgraduate research students have ballooned over the past decade, among both former polytechnics trying to develop new research groups and older universities with long-held research traditions. But government grants or student stipends have not kept pace with the expansion.</p> <p>The Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council is currently drafting plans to award general training packages to university departments so that academics decide the level of stipends awarded to students, and the numbers of students enrolled on PhDs. And the Medical Research Council has announced its own review of postgraduate funding arrangements. Both reviews are expected to focus postgraduate funds on fewer university departments.</p> <p>A particular concern aired by the Hefce report is that the range of skills a postgraduate research student increasingly needs in the sciences is unlikely to be provided by a single academic supervisor. The reviewers argue that a student is more likely to succeed in an environment with good facilities, a breath and depth of supervisory expertise, and in a research-intensive department.</p> <p>But the council is also aware that a move towards greater concentration of resources would potentially undermine the ability of lower research-rated departments to improve their research standing. In larger university units, medical schools for example, there may also be some outstanding researchers, able to provide good supervision, in a generally low-scoring department.</p> <p>The council also proposes to create a new strategic fund to be deployed in subject disciplines suffering shortfalls in demand for PhD places. This has been a particular problem in engineering and computer sciences and some biological research areas in recent years, as graduates opt for well paid jobs rather than poorly paid research training.</p> <p>\"An advanced modern society needs a high number of students with higher degrees,\" argues the report. \"Such graduates are needed to underpin teaching in universities and colleges, particularly for third-year work at bachelor level and for postgraduate programmes. They are also, of course, needed to carry out and develop research in universities, industry and the wider economy. It is from PhD students that the next generation of academic staff are also drawn.\"</p> <p>In 1997-98, the UK produced 11,000 doctorates, according to the report. On average, this means that there are 4.2 PhDs produced for every 100 first-degree graduates. \"This is well over the 1% we estimate is needed for replenishment of the academic profession, although unappealing academic salaries and conditions of service are a cause for concern,\" concludes the report.</p>",
  "<p>Towards the end of last term, the deputy head of one Hackney comprehensive went to greet one of her growing number of supply teachers. She was surprised to find a frail 80-year-old slumped in a chair, and even more surprised to see that the pupils had taken pity on the chap - they spent most of the rest of the day looking after him.</p> <p> Later the same day, at the same school, another supply teacher walked out of the classroom after complaining that her unruly pupils did not show her the respect she deserved, while a third was spotted, feet up on the desk, reading the papers while his pupils ran riot around him. </p> <p>Thousands of children will return to school this week without a permanent teacher at the front of the classroom, as record numbers of staff jobs remain unfilled in an unprecedented recruitment crisis. Although the problem is widespread - affecting tiny rural primary schools as well as sprawling inner-city comprehensives - the shortage is most serious in London. New figures to be published next month will show record vacancies in the capital of 1,020 - the highest figure ever. </p> <p>The problem is not new, and it shows no sign of abating: as the number of vacancies rises, the number of trainees plummets. Some schools have now become reliant on supply teachers - pupils in one inner-city secondary were taught by 13 different maths teachers in the course of a year. And they may be the lucky ones: a few schools have been unable to reopen at all, or have been forced to send pupils home early because of staff shortages, creating unexpected childcare problems for parents. </p> <p>For parents whose children come home to report that they have only a temporary teacher or are likely to have a succession of supply teachers, these are worrying times. And they are right to be concerned: teachers all agree that, although primary school pupils are particularly vulnerable, the lack of a permanent teacher may cause problems for any age group. The reception year of primary school - when children enter at age four and five - is arguably the most important because it is the foundation for a child's entire educational career. But it is not long before they are seven and preparing to take the first round of statutory national curriculum tests in year 2. After that, they have the prospect of the arguably more important tests for 11-year olds in year 6. </p> <p>And it is these critical years, when pupils take the national curriculum SATs tests, that are particularly difficult to fill, says Eric Spear, head of Staplehurst School near Maidstone in Kent. \"The job has completely changed,\" he explains. \"There is so much pressure on teachers to get their pupils through tests that the job has lost its attraction for many people.\" This year, he says, he'd all but given up trying to fill a vacant post for a year 2 teacher until \"someone literally walked in off the street and asked me if there were any jobs going\". </p> <p>Spear, like many other headteachers, stresses that many supply teachers \"are very experienced teaching staff who simply want the flexibility of temporary work and the better pay\". But however good the quality of the teaching, there are some things they simply can't do. </p> <p>Jeni Riley, head of primary education at London University's Institute of Education, says: \"It takes time for young people - from those in the reception class right through to sixth-formers - to get to know and trust a new teacher. The way a child relates to and trusts a teacher very closely affects the way he or she responds.\" </p> <p>It takes time for a teacher to get to know their young charges, too. \"In the critical early years, the younger the children, the more idiosyncratic their knowledge base is,\" says Riley. \"It can take a month at the very least to build up a detailed picture of children's abilities and get to grips with their learning patterns and how they respond to you as a teacher. I don't see how someone bombing in for a day can possibly pick that up and do the children justice. </p> <p>\"Although the curriculum has been tightened up and is now very compartmentalised, teaching very young children remains a highly skilled job. There is also the issue of pastoral care, which for youngsters is as important as teaching. It is not like being a temporary typist, when you can drift in and out.\" </p> <p>Children often react adversely to temporary staff, she claims. \"Some schools in London rely very heavily on supply teachers and they are very much a feature of our schools. But it is difficult for the supply teachers, too. No matter how good they are, children tend to play up when they have a temporary teacher.\" </p> <p>At secondary level, problems are at their most intense for the 11-year-olds who have just joined the school. The Department for Education and Employment has recently recognised the significance of the switch to senior secondary school in year 7, where 11- and 12-year-olds commonly suffer a dip in academic performance as they adjust to their new environment and academic demands. </p> <p>Christina Baski, whose son recently switched from a tiny Suffolk primary to a large secondary school, said she discovered that her son had been skipping lunch because he did not understand how the staggered lunchtime system worked. \"Basically, he was starving all day because he didn't know where to go or who to sit with\", she explained. \"He had two temporary teachers and did not know who to go to, to discuss his problems. He was so hungry that by the afternoon he couldn't even work\". </p> <p>But at secondary level, too, there is no \"safe age\" to be teacherless. After the \"settling in\" in years 7 and 8, teenagers then have SATs tests to prepare for in year 9 at age 14, followed by preparation for GCSEs. Some heads say they are particularly badly affected by the shortages in maths and modern language teaching, and claim it is virtually impossible to prioritise some year groups above others because of the pressures on all years. </p> <p>This leaves some heads trying to pull off an impossible juggling act. \"The whole thing can be an absolute nightmare,\" says one head of a top-performing, large comprehensive. \"You have to start rejigging timetables to account for the fact that people are not available. For example, you may have to start changing subjects, giving one year group extra English because you have a shortage of maths teachers. The whole thing has to be done as seamlessly as possible so as not to upset parents, and you have to make sure you spread the supply teachers and even student teachers around. </p> <p>\"By accident, a child once got four student teachers in one term and the parents, quite justifiably, complained. You hope like hell that in September you can struggle through the autumn and fill the jobs at Christmas. You really rely on your heads of department to monitor the supply teachers to ensure that they are up to scratch in their individual subjects\". </p> <p>Irene Dalton, head of Wombwell school in Barnsley, Yorkshire, an 850-pupil school for 11- to 16-year-olds, said she has been \"desperate\" to recruit a design and technology teacher and a chemistry specialist. The design post is now filled but the chemistry teacher's is not. In the old days it might have been possible to \"hide\" a weaker or temporary teacher, teaching \"soft options\" for some pupils, Dalton says. But not any more: \"There is no 'give' in the system any more. Every single teacher will be teaching across the whole of the 11-16 range, and the pressures of exams and teaching the National Curriculum mean there is no scope for prioritisation. Every year counts and it is simply not fair to deprive, say, the first year of the new intake in favour of those taking GCSEs\". She says that the pressure of finding staff fell to her staff development officers, who in some cases had \"worked late into the night\" speaking to agencies to get cover. </p> <p>Margaret Morrissey of the National Confederation of Parent Teacher Associations agreed that both parents and children were getting a poor deal. \"We are worried that schools' main view of supply teachers is that it's better than nothing. It is impossible not to have supply teachers, and many are very good, but there ought to be a limit,\" she says. </p> <p>The precise legal duty on local education authorities and schools to provide teachers and other staff to take classes is surprisingly vague. The Education (Teacher Qualifications and Health Standards) Regulations 1999 specify simply that they must supply \"suitable and sufficient numbers for the purposes of securing the provision of education appropriate to the ages, abilities, aptitudes and needs of the pupils\". </p> <p>Not good enough, says Morrissey. \"I've had distraught parents saying their children have had seven teachers in a term but that their complaints to the school had fallen on deaf ears. And I've heard of children having two sets of work books for two supply teachers covering one subject between them. It's time we gave our children the support they deserve.\"</p>",
  "<p>In the US last week a distraught family told the media how their three-year-old girl was taken into care. \"They dragged her out of the room kicking and screaming,\" said her mother. \"She was terrified.\" The toddler in question, Anamarie Martinez-Regino, weighs eight and a half stone. She is three times as heavy as an average American three-year-old and, according to the doctors involved, her condition is \"life-threatening\". </p> <p>Childhood obesity is a severe problem in the US. The latest data shows that more than one-fifth of US children are overweight, and about one in 10 obese. You might think this predictable in the land that invented doublechocolatechocolatechip ice-cream. But look around you: British kids, too, are getting fatter. </p> <p>Last year, a study in the British Medical Journal found that nearly 16% of two-year-olds were overweight and 6% were obese, while more than 20% of four-year-olds were overweight and 7.6% obese. </p> <p>This hasn't always been the case: between 1972 and 1994, English boys grew 10% fatter, and girls 5%; while in Scotland boys got 13% fatter and girls 16%. </p> <p>Of course, there's nothing wrong with a chubby child. But a heavily overweight one is a different matter. Obesity in children can cause health problems: an increased risk of disease, problems moving around, a greater risk of cardiovascular difficulties and of abnormalities in glucose metabolism (diabetes, for instance). </p> <p>This doesn't even touch on the psychological damage a fat child can suffer. \"Every minute of every day friends, teachers, family, TV and magazines are telling them they're worthless,\" says Dr Paul Gateley, senior lecturer in exercise physiology and health at Leeds Metropolitan University. </p> <p>So what should you do if your child is worryingly fat? Should you tackle the issue and risk undermining their self-esteem, or sit tight and hope it will sort itself out? </p> <p>\"Children grow at different rates,\" Gateley says. \"They often lay down fat in preparation for growth spurts.\" </p> <p>\"The first thing you should do if you're worrying,\" says Dr Susan Jebb, head of nutrition and health at the Medical Research Council's nutrition centre in Cambridge, \"is compare your child with others of the same age. If yours is significantly fatter (say one of the fattest three), then you may have cause for concern.\" Then you should see your GP. \"They'll compare your child's size to 'normal' growth charts, and establish whether there is genuinely a problem.\" </p> <p>But the chances are nobody will be able to tell you exactly why your child is fat. Parents will often put a child's (and their own) weight problem down to \"unlucky genes\". They'll claim that their little one eats normally, and yet still gains weight. Genes certainly could play a part in deciding fatness: numerous studies have clearly shown this. But the findings are far from specific. \"So far more than 200 genes have been identified that have some association with obesity,\" Jebb says. \"But we really know very little about the genes themselves.\" </p> <p>What we do know is that it's rare for genes alone to cause a child to balloon. Only five children worldwide have been identified in whom there is a specific defect in the \"ob gene\". This single defect can lead to gross obesity from an early age (and could well be the cause of Anamarie's weight gain). </p> <p>But with most fat children, the diagnosis is more straightforward. \"If your energy intake exceeds your energy needs,\" Jebb says, \"you'll gain weight.\" Not surprisingly, research has shown a marked similarity between the eating habits of parents and their children. Wolfing a Wispa while trying to get your kids to eat broccoli, is not the best strategy. \"You have to create the right environment for healthy eating,\" says Gateley, \"one in which your children eat three good meals a day, and don't snack.\" </p> <p>What you mustn't do, though, is deny your child food. \"The concept of dieting for children is completely inappropriate except in the most extreme cases,\" says Jebb. Instead, the trick is to make changes without your child realising. \"Forget to fill up the sweet drawer,\" suggests Gateley, \"and fill up the fruit bowl instead.\" </p> <p>You also have to get your child to exercise. It's just as important as eating right and it's something most British children don't get anywhere near enough of. Less than 5% now walk or cycle to school compared with more than 80% 20 years ago. Most spend their leisure hours slumped in front of the TV or computer screen. One US study showed a 2% increase in child obesity for each extra hour of telly watched. </p> <p>Setting a good example works here, too. A study of children aged four to seven found that the ones with active parents were seven times more energetic than their lazy-parented friends. \"Kids need to associate activity with fun,\" says Gateley. \"Obesity doesn't develop overnight,\" says Jebb, \"and you can't treat it overnight either.\" Indeed, you shouldn't even be thinking in terms of weight loss for your child. \"All you have to do is stop them gaining any more weight.\"</p>",
  "<p>The sponsorship opportunities being bandied around at this year's Olympics make Anthea and Grant's recent efforts look like child's play. From Coca-Cola to Kodak, Time to Telstra, everyone seems to want a piece of the sporting action.</p> <p>The main sponsors of the event - the so-called \"TOP\", or The Olympic Partnership sponsors - are estimated to have paid upwards of $40 million. For that the sponsors, which include McDonald's, Coca-Cola, IBM and Visa, get the global exclusive on advertising Olympic tie-ins for their sector, and the right to a physical presence at the Games.</p> <p>Of course, it does not include the cost of the actual advertising to be done throughout the world on television, print, posters and the web, which will doubtless run to many, many more millions.</p> <p>So is it worth it? McDonald's seems to think so. It has just signed up for the 2002 Salt Lake Ciy Olympics and the 2004 Athens Summer Games at a reported cost of $55 million.</p> <p>But IBM has dropped out of TOP, and the organisers of the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics are said to be having trouble finding sponsors because of the bribery scandal surrounding the selection of Salt Lake City for the 2000 Games.</p> <p>The other problem is that not everyone is prepared to pay for the benefit of association with the Games. This year the International Olympic Committee has tried to regain some control over advertising relating to the Games after a Nike campaign that ran during the 1996 Olympics. The campaign, which featured lines such as, \"You don't win silver; you lose gold,\" was criticised as being antithetical to the spirit of the games.</p> <p>The criticism gave rise to the term \"ambush marketing\", a practice the IOC is keen to stamp out. The committee drew up a code of practice for advertisers. But recent campaigns from Qantas and the National Australia Bank, another non-sponsor that has run ads linking itself to the Olympics, have proved the code to be pretty ineffectual.</p>",
  "<p>It's been a good year for Malcolm Wicks, and he was due for one. An expert in social policy and the welfare state, he was shadow social security minister before the election, and was bitterly disappointed not to get the social security job, or any other job, after Labour's 1997 election victory. He was probably passed over because he was thought too Old Labour, with his belief in universal welfare benefits and his ability to say \"socialism\" with no apparent embarrassment.</p> <p>Today he can see the silver lining. He wouldn't be happy running social security in a government which has gone down the road of means-tested benefits: he's spent a lifetime saying that welfare benefits were not just for the poor and dispossessed, but a right of citizenship. \"Poor people's services tend to be poor services,\" was how he put it. </p> <p>Instead, last year, he was pitchforked into education as Minister for Lifelong Learning, with (so it's said) an additional brief of reconnecting Labour with its heartlands. At first he felt like a fish out of water, but a few weeks into the job he realised that lifelong learning was a crucial aspect of social policy. He's probably also noticed that the more disillusioned Labour's heartlands get with Blair, the more indispensable Wicks becomes. </p> <p>He has successfully steered the learning and skills bill through parliament, with much less fuss than was expected. Like most politicians, though, he'd rather talk about the next frontier than about consolidating the last one, and he admits that the next few months are going to be hard work. He says he has to get the new councils to work - many of them don't have chief executives yet - while ensuring that the TECs and the Further Education Funding Council work effectively, even though they are about to be abolished. He admits the funding council has already encountered problems. </p> <p>And the new councils have to make sure colleges run the courses they identify as necessary, which won't always be easy. If local colleges won't run them, someone else will have to be found, he says, and it's clearly intended as a warning to colleges. </p> <p>In August, so quietly that no one has yet noticed, he acquired an additional responsibility, for basic skills. This means that it will fall to him to bring in a package of measures in the autumn designed to end adult illiteracy and innumeracy. For the moment, he's on the up escalator. </p> <p>The opposition to the learning and skills bill seemed to crumble before him. It is generally welcomed on Labour's left (unlike Labour's policy for schools). Colleges see it as heralding the day when further education ceases to be the Cinderella sector. And the Conservatives got themselves hopelessly impaled on Section 28, so that on the last day, after hours of filibustering, Wicks was able to jibe that they had kept everyone in the House of Commons until 3am, a time when anyone who gave a damn about family values would want to be at home with their partners and children. </p> <p>And the package incorporated at least one of his own pet ideas, the Connexions strategy, which gives every young person between 16 and 19 a personal adviser, to help them make not just educational and career choices, but life choices, too. (Connexions is supposed to be spelled that way. It's the old way of spelling it, says Wicks, though uncharitable commentators think some spin-doctor thought a clever graphic might come out of the X.) </p> <p>Business leaders at first welcomed Connexions, seeing it as a way of ensuring that skills shortages were put right, but grew progressively less enthusiastic as it became clear that Wicks saw it as a way of countering social exclusion. \"You've got 157,000 young people - almost one in 11 of our 16- to 19-year-olds - who are not in education, training or work\" he says. Everyone is supposed to benefit from Connexions, but it will focus especially on those 157,000. </p> <p>As it happens, he met one of them recently - a girl in his Croydon constituency, who had found her own place in a sixth form to study for A-levels, but had a small baby and did not know where to turn for childcare. Wicks sorted it out, but not every girl in that position would find her way to her local MP. That's what personal advisers will be for. </p> <p>Wicks sees education not as a grey matter of standards, exams, qualifications, but as \"potentially the most effective battering ram against social inequality.\" He's not so much moved from social policy to education, as brought a social policy training to bear on education issues. He recalled for me that Lord Beveridge, whose report at the end of the second world war signalled the birth of the welfare state, identified \"five giants\" which had to be slain: want, idleness, disease, squalor - and ignorance. More than half a century later, the Moser report reveals widespread adult illiteracy, and \"it's really wrecking people's lives.\" Ignorance remains to be slain.</p> <p>That's probably part of the reason why, in Labour's heartlands, his area of responsibility is less under attack than most. He spectacularly wooed this year's conference of the further education lecturers union, Natfhe, and cemented the relationship over lunch with the discovery that he and Paul Mackney shared a passion for Bob Dylan - the magical bonding effect of which can only be understood by fellow fifty-somethings. Mackney later sent him a copy of Dylan's new release, symbolically called Things Have Changed. </p> <p>He's the unions' favourite education minister, given their growing distrust of Blunkett and their edgy relationship with Wicks' predecessor, George Mudie. But they want a great deal more than he's delivering. He's found an extra \u00a350m for lecturers' pay, but it will still leave them a long way behind schoolteachers, and he has failed to deliver a right to paid time off for study. But \"we're getting a hearing now, and he's committed to lifelong learning\" says Mackney. </p> <p>That may be the result of his own education. The son of the last Labour chairman of the old London County Council, Arthur Wicks, young Malcolm was sent from London to a rather strange private school in Guernsey, which he disliked, and where he did badly, getting poor O-levels. (He failed British Constitution, \"just the right background for a government minister\" he says.) So he did A-levels at the North West London Polytechnic, making him one of the first people to discover that further education was a much more adult way for a 17-year-old to study. </p> <p>\"Further education gave me my second chance,\" he says. \"Suddenly I was in a much more adult, mature environment, with lots of overseas students. But because of my poor O-levels, most universities would not consider me.\" Fortunately, the London School of Economics, where he did his degree in social policy, proved the exception, but he says: \"That's when I realised that one should not put hurdles in front of people - you should have a second, third and fourth chance at education if you want it.\"</p>",
  "<p>CityReach International yesterday underlined burgeoning investor interest in secure internet exchanges, the bunkers that provide a secure environment in which to house the networking and telecoms equipment that drives the web, by announcing a \u00a3100m fundraising. </p> <p>The warehouse style units are the internet revolution's equivalent of the dark satanic mills of the industrial revolution - and investors cannot get enough of them. </p> <p>CityReach's latest investment round was led by Investcorp and included the billionaire Microsoft co-founder, Paul Allen's Vulcan Ventures. The British firm has raised around \u00a3190m since July and a flotation is likely to follow by next spring. </p> <p>CityReach is operating in one of the fastest growing internet spaces. Goldman Sachs estimates that the European market for co-location and basic support services will reach $6.7bn (\u00a34.6bn) by 2005. Web hosting will be worth a further $16.1bn. </p> <p>Inevitably several internet exchange - or \"internet hotel\" - firms are battling to build the biggest and best centres in Europe's leading cities. </p> <p>It is a race already well under way in the United States and one that has helped transform the likes of Exodus into a $27.3bn concern in four years. </p> <p>By the end of 2001, CityReach plans to have 20 centres up and running in cities including London, Amsterdam, Berlin, Stockholm, Paris and Hamburg. Telecity, which is valued at \u00a31.6bn after an IPO on the London Stock Exchange in June, is already running nine and has signed leases on properties in Paris, Munich, Brussels and Barcelona. Goldman reckons Telecity will have revenue of \u00a3624m by 2005. </p> <p>Demand for data centre services is being driven by several factors. European internet growth is accelerating as the cost of bandwidth falls, more people and businesses come online and the European telecoms market is liberalised. </p> <p>CityReach takes a \"modular\" and almost militaristic approach to construction, containerising its generators and air conditioning units at an off-site location in the Netherlands and simply dropping them into place by crane. A 150,000sq ft facility can be built from scratch in six months for around \u00a320m. </p> <p>Visitors to CityReach's internet hotel on the outskirts of Schipol airport in Amsterdam face a daunting check-in at reception. Passport identification is needed, cars are searched for bombs and visitors must pass through metal detectors. Inside, CCTV cameras cover every angle and infrared alarms are triggered if a ceiling or floor tile is moved. </p> <p>Security has to be high: CityReach guarantees customers that their servers will be active 99.9999% of the time. \"If the servers are down for more than eight minutes in any one year customers are entitled to claim some of their money back,\" said its chief financial officer, James Lewisohn. </p> <p>The race to build exchanges could, however, be stalled by a lack of power, Mr Lewisohn warned. Each server consumes large quantities of electricity and has to be constantly cooled by chilled water systems. </p> <p>Mr Lewisohn said that Britain could miss out on hundreds of millions of pounds of new economy investment if power firms did not themselves reverse years of underinvestment in generating capacity. </p> <p>\"The internet has been a toytown in the first few years of its genesis. Unless we can guarantee the internet won't fall over and connections are constant, like telephones, it will be just like CB radio.\"</p>",
  "Being Britain's most popular politician was, in the end, not enough to save Mo Mowlam. Public approval ratings topping those of Tony Blair reflected the cabinet co-ordinator's love affair with the public but at Westminster they fuelled rivalries that were to help bring her down. <p>As the Redcar MP's husband Jon Norton put it yesterday: \"Popularity is not always the most popular thing among one's colleagues.\" </p> <p>Ms Mowlam's decision to quit follows a long whispering campaign that saw her health and ability questioned by senior figures in the government, with even the prime minister said to be frustrated by his star attraction. Her spectacular announcement yesterday came only a month after she used a New Statesman interview to insist that her political obituaries were premature. \"I don't plan to go. No,\" she insisted in early August. </p> <p>Yet Labour colleagues in north-east England had been privately speculating for months that she could go despite again easily topping the Guardian's cabinet popularity poll this summer. </p> <p>The support of millions of voters could not save her from sniping from some of Labour's most senior figures, which appears to have left her fed up with Westminster and ready for a new challenge. </p> <p>And it was claimed last night by a senior member of the government that last October she made a bad career move, turning down a chance to become health secretary after leaving Northern Ireland in favour of a Cabinet Office post she was to find \"humdrum\". </p> <p><b> Standing ovation</b><br> </p> <p>In truth her position within the government has been on the slide almost since Mr Blair's mere mention of her name during his keynote speech to the party's 1998 conference won her an extraordinary standing ovation. </p> <p>Sympathisers claimed No 10 could not cope with a minister more popular than the prime minister and had to bring her down a peg or two; critics argued she became out of control, believing she was untouchable and refusing to toe the line. </p> <p>The result was a series of stories in the media questioning her health and ability, at times fuelled by Ms Mowlam talking of her own problems, which reduced her to tears and, despite the official denials, exposed a growing rift between Downing Street and one of its biggest electoral assets. </p> <p>Earlier this summer she was rebuked by No 10 after repeating calls for the royal family to quit Buckingham Palace and move to a new home. Last January Ms Mowlam found herself in the middle of a row over drugs after admitting she smoked pot in her youth, the following month urging the police to target \"killer\" drugs rather than cannabis. </p> <p>Her decision to appear at the dog wedding on Channel 4's So, Graham Norton show raised eyebrows. If she had not jumped, in all likelihood Ms Mowlam would have been pushed after the election. </p> <p>Cash-strapped since Mr Norton lost his job in banking, the couple will keep their grace and favour flat in Whitehall's Admiralty House, and she has a deal reputedly worth up to \u00a3350,000 for her autobiography. </p> <p>That deal and an imminent biography by journalist Julia Langdon, the details of which Ms Mowlam checked, suggested that she was thinking of life after politics. </p> <p>Peter Mandelson, who replaced her in Belfast last Autumn, and Jonathan Powell, the No 10 chief of staff dubbed the \"Downing Street poisoner\", are expected to be accused by Ms Langdon - despite denials - of undermining Ms Mowlam. </p> <p>Mr Mandelson made clear his irritation with Ms Mowlam last week. \"If she chooses to co-operate with somebody like that and an exercise like that,\" he said, \"well that is her judgment.\" </p> <p>Ms Mowlam, 51 later this month, denied her health played any part in the decision to quit and maintained she had recovered from the brain tumour diagnosed shortly before the 1997 election. The whig has gone but at a party barely two months ago she appeared unsteady on her feet, being helped up and down a platform no higher than 12 inches. </p> <p>In Northern Ireland, Ms Mowlam can claim a genuine part in reviving a flagging peace process using her chameleon personality to charm both sides of the sectarian fence. She first risked offending the Catholics by allowing the unionist march through Drumcree following Labour's election. She also entered the Maze to treat with the Protestant paramilitaries. But her informal style and determination to bring Sinn Fein into mainstream politics gradually pushed her beyond the pale of unionist opinion. </p> <p>Her remarks questioning the principle of consent were too much for David Trimble, the Ulster Unionist leader. He found her dreamy, vacillating, offensive, and pro-Catholic. Within five months or so, he refused to negotiate with her on big issues demanding to speak directly with the prime minister or Mr Powell. </p> <p>Seamus Mallon, the deputy first minister, recalled: \"The first set of negotiations were in Hillsborough Council. I got the shock of my life. This was Mo's house, the place where she lived. Yet during those negotiations you had the secretary of state wandering about the corridors with other people wondering what was going on in the negotiations.\" </p> <p>Once her historic task of bringing Sinn Fein back to the negotiating table had been achieved, Mr Blair took on the minutiae of the talks. From that moment, ironically the height of her public popularity, her political star began to wane. </p> <p>Ms Mowlam's removal from Northern Ireland was deferred last summer when she protested over a planned reshuffle by Mr Blair and went on holiday to Turkey, but she was eventually forced to make way for Mr Mandelson's return to cabinet last October. </p> <p>Mr Mandelson and Ms Mowlam did not subsequently speak, a silence that spoke volumes about their relationship, whatever warm words were uttered in public yesterday. </p> <p>Maybe she could have had the health job. At all events, she ended up in a political cul de sac as Cabinet Office minister, an odd jobs posting with a bizarre collection of unrelated responsibilities. Some say she could have made more of the new job. Others say there was no true cabinet-level job to do. </p> <p>Those close to her said she found the Cabinet Office's essential task of co-ordination - she eschewed the term enforcer - deeply frustrating. In part, the gifts required were much too similar to those that had been needed in Northern Ireland where she was trying to liaise between different parties, rather than initiate her own policies. In the Cabinet Office job, she was again asked to liaise, but not arbitrate, between warring Whitehall departments. </p> <p>This lack of independent power left her short of genuine room to make policy. The backroom, nitty gritty role, also seemed entirely inappropriate for her gifts of warmth, intelligent informality and communicating with the public. </p> <p><b> Animated </b><br> </p> <p>In theory in charge of drugs policy, she became genuinely animated by the issue, but found the home secretary, Jack Straw, and Downing Street blocking her desire to adopt a more liberal approach to the possession of cannabis. </p> <p>She also grandly had the job of co-ordinating the government policy to combat social exclusion. But much of the work was undertaken by the vigorous director of the social exclusion unit, Marjorie Wallace. The unit reported directly to the prime minister and many of the key decisions on its work programme were decided inside the Downing Street policy unit. The Treasury and Gordon Brown also rarely let any anti-poverty programmes out of their sight. </p> <p>Similarly, she nominally controlled policy on GM technology, but many of the big battles took place between the Ministry of Agriculture, the Department of Trade and the Department of the Environment. </p> <p>The same story could be said of rural policy, something she monitored, but did not control. </p> <p>It was Lord Falconer, her Cabinet Office colleague and Mr Blair's personal friend, who did much of the screening of cabinet committee papers. Lord Falconer, a barrister, is a consumer and synthesiser of papers. Ms Mowlam's commitment to detail, by contrast, was more sporadic. </p> <p>She also boobed by failing to halt (or if some are believed, encouraged) speculation that she could be Labour's candidate for mayor of London. Not only did she undermine Frank Dobson's prospects of defeating Ken Livingstone, she signalled her lack of interest in the post she held. </p> <p>Although temperamentally a Blairite - she was his campaign manager for the leadership - she never quite took the public lead on new thinking inside government, even though the Blair thinktank, the performance and innovation unit, operated from inside the Cabinet Office. </p> <p>This all left Ms Mowlam with bits and pieces: reducing red tape, modernising the mechanics of the civil service, the People's Panel, visits to drug rehabilitation centres, worthy plans to put government services on line. </p> <p>Her friends and critics in journalism also say she became her own worst enemy. Successive newspaper interviews with her focused on the supposed whispering campaign against her, the winning personality, or her political indiscretions. But she did few big serious interviews about her political ideas or policies. </p> <p>One lobby journalist on a broadsheet daily, friendly to her, asked to do an interview on her drugs brief, in the hope that it might project her as a weighty player, but she said nothing new. The reporter was reduced to recycling the stories about the supposed briefings against her, leading to a distressed complaint from Ms Mowlam the next morning. Some of the most scathing attacks on her also emanated from briefings she herself inadvertently gave, including a piece in the Independent on Sunday based on a briefing she gave to the paper's editor. </p> <p>Her martyrdom and fight against the brain tumour inadvertently became Mo Mowlam's own story. <br></p> <p><b>The gossip: More spinned against than spinning?</b></p> <p><b> Peter Mandelson</b> </p> <p>Cold and calculating, he is a different beast from the freewheeling woman he replaced as Northern Ireland secretary. </p> <p>Relations were strained from 1994 after Ms Mowlam, who publicly ran Tony Blair's Labour leadership bid, discovered that Mr Mandelson - codenamed \"Bobby\" - was privately calling the shots. </p> <p>The friendship broke down last year when Mr Mandelson pulled off a cabinet comeback and replaced her in Belfast. </p> <p>He denied being behind the whispering campaign questioning her health and judgment and her role in the peace process, but his form as a spin doctor puts him at, or near, the top of any list of suspects. </p> <p><b> Jonathan Powell</b> </p> <p>Tony Blair's chief of staff clashed with Ms Mowlam over Northern Ireland where he was No 10's man in the talks. </p> <p>Dubbed the \"Downing Street poisoner\" by Ms Mowlam's supporters, Mr Powell was frustrated by what he saw as her failure to grapple with crucial details and her poor relationship with the Ulster Unionists. </p> <p>He promoted Ms Mowlam as Labour's candidate for mayor of London in what was viewed as an attempt to get her out of Belfast but Mr Powell vehemently denies being behind any whispering campaign. </p> <p><b> Spin doctors</b> </p> <p>The official line is that Alastair Campbell and Labour's spin doctors have never said a bad word about Ms Mowlam and all assertions to the contrary are \"c-r-a-p\". </p> <p>The official line from a Millbank spin doctor on Sunday, when asked about speculation that she was about to quit, was: \"It has absolutely no basis in fact.\" It had and she did, and the party's high command was again caught out denying something that was true. </p> <p><b> Jealous colleagues</b> </p> <p>Her very popularity with the public made Ms Mowlam unpopular among a number of Labour backbenchers and ministers with lower profiles. While they conform, in the hope of climbing the greasy pole, she was unconventional and could reach people turned off by identikit politicians. </p> <p><b> Ulster Unionists</b> </p> <p>David Trimble and many Unionists were glad to see the back of her in Northern Ireland, complaining she was too close to the nationalists and republicans. The leader of the Belfast assembly made no secret of the fact he wanted her replaced, even touting Mr Mandelson's name shortly before Mr Blair shuffled his pack. </p> <p><b> Mo Mowlam</b> </p> <p>She can, admit some of her friends, be her own worst enemy. Ms Mowlam talked about her troubles instead of bottling them up, spreading at least some of the damaging media gossip about her health, life and work. </p> <p>The down to earth Ms Mowlam that won over voters is the same Ms Mowlam who can be short with Whitehall officials and anger cabinet ministers unused to such a blunt approach. </p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.cabinet-office.gov.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">www.cabinet-office.gov.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>A group of 28 Greenpeace volunteers who destroyed part of a field of genetically modified maize last summer did so to attract publicity to their cause, a court heard yesterday. </p> <p>The volunteers, led by Lord Melchett, executive director of the environmental movement, fully expected to be apprehended when they entered a field at Walnut Tree Farm at Lyng, near Dereham, Norfolk, in July 1999 and began destroying the crop, a jury at Norwich crown court was told. </p> <p>All 28 volunteers, 14 of whom worked for Greenpeace, were wearing white suits with the Greenpeace logo on the back, and had arranged for a video to be taken of the attack. </p> <p>\"The taking of the video was of course to give publicity to their cause. When the public watched the video on the TV news there would be no doubt as to who the culprits were,\" said John Farmer QC who was opening the case for the prosecution on the first day of a retrial. </p> <p>At the original trial in April the 28 were cleared of charges of theft but the jury was not able to reach a verdict on the criminal damage charges after seven and a half hours of deliberation. All 28 defendants pleaded not guilty and claimed they acted to save other crops that were in danger of contamination by pollen from the GM maize. </p> <p>The six and a half acre crop was part of a farm trial of GM maize on land owned by William Brigham. The group gathered at Mr Brigham's farm shortly before 5am and brought a tractor, a tipper truck, and a cutting device. </p> <p>Their intention was to uproot the maize, put it in bags and dump it outside the headquarters of AgrEvo Ltd (now called Aventis), the biotechnology company responsible for developing the GM herbicide resistant maize, said Mr Farmer. </p> <p>The group cut a chain to gain access to the field of maize then replaced it with a padlock to slow down anyone attempting to stop them. They then began uprooting the crop. Shortly afterwards Mr Brigham arrived having learned of the group's plans and the police were called. All 28 were arrested and charged. </p> <p>\"The growing of that crop by Mr Brigham was a perfectly lawful activity and the prosecution say to destroy it was unlawful because it's unlawful to destroy other people's property,\" said Mr Farmer. </p> <p>\"To go on someone else's land because you have a difference of opinion is in no way reasonable. If you lose the argument, to go out and destroy is not reasonable in a democratic country. What's really behind this is not concern for property but to advance the cause for publicity.\" </p> <p>Before the attack on Mr Brigham's farm Lord Melchett, a former Labour peer who owns an organic farm in Norfolk, wrote to Mr Brigham encouraging him to remove the maize before it flowered and released pollen that might contaminate other crops, the court heard. </p> <p>\"I do hope that in all the circumstances you will see the need for this crop to be removed before flowering,\" he wrote in the letter which was read to the jury of five women and seven men. </p> <p>\"It doesn't say that if you don't do it, myself and others will come down to do it\" said Mr Farmer. </p> <p>The jury also heard Judith Jordan, product development manager at Aventis, who told the court that the firm had not consulted local people before the GM maize was planted. Forty eight farm-scale trials of GM crops began this summer and a further 25 are planned for the autumn. </p> <p>Judge David Mellor warned the jury: \"It is not about whether GM crops are a good thing for the environment or a bad thing. It is for you to listen to the evidence and reach honest conclusions asto the facts.\" </p> <p>The trial continues today. </p> <p><strong> The 28 on trial are:</strong> </p> <p>Adrian O'Neil, 26, Beverley, East Yorkshire. </p> <p>Alastair Beveridge, 31, Aberdeen. </p> <p>Andrew McParland, 34, Epsom, Surrey. </p> <p>Andy Tait, 29, Highbury, north London. </p> <p>Brenda Ramsey, 34, Leytonstone, east London. </p> <p>Chris Holden, 22, Tottenham, north London. </p> <p>Emma Hargreaves, 29, Tooting, south London. </p> <p>Emma Protz, 28, Enfield, north London. </p> <p>Iain McSeveny, 37, Highbury, north London. </p> <p>Jacky Westwood, 42, Mexborough, South Yorkshire. </p> <p>Jo Melzack, 52, Withington, Manchester. </p> <p>Keith Dawson, 27, Stamford, Lincolnshire. </p> <p>Lisa Weatherley, 31, Chessington, Surrey. </p> <p>Malcolm Carroll, 44, Stafford. </p> <p>Margaret Weaver, 44, Sandhurst, Berkshire. </p> <p>Martin Porter, 30, Glossop, Derbyshire. </p> <p>Michael Uwins, 54, Wymondham, Norfolk. </p> <p>Mick Waldram, 39, Coalville, Leicestershire. </p> <p>Nicola Cook, 32, Diss, Norfolk. </p> <p>Paul Belloti, 57, London. </p> <p>Peter Melchett, 52, Hunstanton, Norfolk. </p> <p>Rachel Murray, 27, Highbury, north London. </p> <p>Simon Hackin, 34, Edinburgh. </p> <p>Simon Bowens, 33, Guisley, Leeds. </p> <p>Spencer Cooke, 32, Bradwell, Hope Valley, Derbyshire. </p> <p>Stokely Webster, 29, London. </p> <p>Tim Copley, 42, Harpenden, Hertfordshire. </p> <p>Tim Hewke, 40, Lower Clapton, east London.</p>",
  "It is a picture postcard example of Cornwall's appeal to visitors: a small town of steep winding streets, bristling with signs of its medieval, Tudor and Victorian past. <p>Fowey, with a population just over 2,100, overlooks a beautiful estuary where sailing boats nestle under wooded hills and the autumn regatta is a popular occasion. It hosts an annual festival in honour of the area's most famous author, Daphne Du Maurier.</p> <p>Yet according to the local MP, Colin Breed, 30% of the homes in Fowey are second homes. \"In January and February at the weekend the whole place is quite decimated.\"</p> <p>Mr Breed, the Liberal Democrat spokesman on agriculture and rural affairs, stoked the debate on second homes yesterday when he launched a discussion document calling for an end to 50% council tax rebates on them and urging that councils be able to force people buying houses they were not going to live in the whole time to ask for special planning permission.</p> <p>The document said the \"increased immigration of wealthy and more affluent people\" had forced house prices up and cut the amount of affordable housing to local people. Lembit Opik, the Lib Dem MP for Montgomeryshire, added: \"We don't want the countryside to become a dormitory for the weekend.\"</p> <p>The party is considering a new form of \"tied housing\" where, like the farmworkers' cottages of old, rural houses are set aside for teachers or other key workers who otherwise could not afford to move to desirable areas.</p> <p>Estate agents in Fowey yesterday were not sure that restrictions were necessary yet. Chris Parsons, a partner in May, Whetter and Grose, said: \"There is a hard core of local people who would like to stay in town and buy a house and cannot afford the property prices we now have here.</p> <p>\"But there is so little employment locally that it is likely they would have to go out of the county anyway.\" He did not think the proportion of second homes had changed significantly for years.</p> <p>\"I suppose if we reached the point where 40-50 % were holiday homes, we might need to consider restrictions.\"</p> <p>A three-bedroom property on the waterfront could now fetch \u00a3300,000 or more, and 70% of his buyers were from the home counties. But they were not generally buying properties previously occupied by locals.</p> <p>Estate agent Max Harrower, of Fowey River, also denied things had changed much in recent years. \"A lot of people coming here are providing income for people locally. People come back here and say it has not been spoilt commercially. It is a natural place for some to come down and spend a few weeks a year and perhaps do a bit of holiday letting.\"</p> <p>Restormel district council disputed Mr Breed's figure, and said the true percentage of holiday homes in Fowey was nearer 15%.</p> <p>Some fashionable spots on Cornwall's north coast have an even higher proportion of second homes. As many as 70% of properties in Treyarnon Bay, near Padstow, may be holiday homes, says John Weller, prospective Tory parliamentary candidate for north Cornwall, and leader of Restormel district council.</p> <p>English councils, like those in Wales, should have the discretion to charge full council tax, he said. \"No one who is well enough off to come to live in such a beautiful place would not want it to regenerate itself.\"</p> <p>Such a change could bring Cornwall county council an extra \u00a35m for education and social services. If the government did not introduce new powers in the expected rural white paper, Tories in the west country would want it in their party manifesto for the next general election, he said. \"It is not a party political thing. Most people find it realistic.\"</p> <p>There are thought to be about 250,000 second homes in England and Wales. Ministers have been hinting at action, but Michael Meacher, the environment minister, who owns a second home in Gloucestershire, was accused last year of threatening to start a \"class war\" when he suggested that they should be banned in some areas.</p>",
  "Congratulations on raising the important issue of recruitment and retention problems in the public sector (Leader, September 4). These difficulties will get worse over the next 20 years with an increasing ageing workforce and a significant reduction in the number of young people in the labour market. Action is needed now to address current and future problems and the government must start by presenting more positive images of the public sector. It is obvious that continually criticising public servants impacts directly on morale and service quality which in turn leads to them openly complaining about their own work environment to colleagues, friends and, more importantly, their own children. Many of us now discourage our children from pursuing a career in public service. As the public sector fights to attract young people in an increasingly competitive labour market, the government must review its presentation of the value of public service .We need an attitudinal shift from our ministers. <p> <br><b>Terry Gorman</b> <br>President, Society of Chief Personnel Officers in Local Government <br><a href=\"mailto:terry.gorman@nottscc.gov.uk\">terry.gorman@nottscc.gov.uk</a> </p> <p>\u0095 The health of any nation is measured by the strength of its public services. There is indeed a recruitment crisis in the public sector and we should all be worried about this. As your leader points out, part of the blame lies with governments of all colours who have misled potential recruits into believing that by definition the public sector is wasteful, inefficient and resistant to change. What makes things worse is that in local government at least, there is also a crisis of retention, with far too many experienced and knowledgeable older workers leaving to take early retirement. Our research shows that ill health, possibly brought on by the stress induced by massive and constant change, is a major reason. Council workers we have talked to want to stay in local government, as long as councils can be more flexible in the way they employ and manage their people. We (ie local government, government and the public) need to change our attitudes and give them some support. </p> <p> <br><b>Paul Masterman</b> <br>Head of public sector recruitment, TMP Worldwide, Birmingham <br><a href=\"mailto:pmasterman@tmpw.co.uk\">pmasterman@tmpw.co.uk</a></p> <p> <br>\u0095 Would those employers complaining about a skills shortage be the same downsizing, core/periphery, hire and fire employers who don't train people? </p> <p> <br><b>Bryan Sadler</b> <br>Lancaster <br><a href=\"mailto:bryan@bhsadler.free-online.co.uk\">bryan@bhsadler.free-online.co.uk</a> </p>",
  "Your report that New Labour is about to drop any commitment to an \"ethical dimension\" to UK foreign policy (Labour drops 'ethical' tag, September 4) sends yet another depressing message about the cynicism and opportunism of Britain's main political parties. <p>Time and again, ethical and environmental aims are sacrificed for short-term economic or political advantage. New Labour has found it only possible to be \"ethical\" if there are no competing demands for government backing, for example arms sales or contracts to build huge dams. Our political system is increasingly value-free and geared to promoting economic growth above human rights and environmental protection. </p> <p>In the long-run, the stability and sustainability of the world's environment and political system depends on human values and ethical concerns being at the heart of government decisions. Foreign policy \"realists\" (or cynics) forget this fact at their peril. </p> <p>Peter Hain pleads that the Labour government should \"be judged by our record\", whether there is any explicit promise to behave ethically or not. Friends of the Earth would be happy if that test was applied by the public. We still await, for example, the government's final decision on whether or not to give insurance backing to the building of the Ilisu Dam. Some decisions cannot be ducked forever, nor obscured behind a fuzz of warm rhetoric. </p> <p><br><b>Tony Juniper</b> <br>Policy and campaigns director, Friends of the Earth </p> <p> </p> <p> \u0095 Poor old Robin Cook! It had been a millstone round his neck, you see... I feel sorry for him. Now at least we can sell arms to whoever we want to and no jumped up human rights people can throw \"ethical foreign policy\" in his face. Could New Labour get any more boring in their depressing predictability? </p> <p><br><b>Chris Welch</b> <br>Sheffield </p>",
  "<p>Suddenly internet stocks are back in fashion. The bubble which burst so spectacularly earlier in the year is showing signs of re-inflating. Fair enough, the extent to which the sector had fallen has pushed prices down to levels where some sort of bounce was to be expected. But there are worrying signs that the lessons which should have been learned last time round are being ignored. </p> <p>The rally is not driven entirely by sentiment. There is news around that might help to shift perceptions. Last week there was speculation of a merger between Italy's Tiscali and World Online, and the two are talking. Yesterday's trigger was a combination the purchase of Spanish portal operator Ya.com by T-Online, Deutsche Telekom's internet service provider, plus a suggestion that the German company is looking towards Britain and speculation that France's Vivendi was running the rule over UK online directory service Scoot. </p> <p>But is one purchase plus several rumours sufficient to construct an industry consolidation theory that justifies a plunge back into the sector by cash-rich funds ? Hardly. And why should everyone decide almost overnight that discounts which have been around for months are now irresistible? The most likely explanation is that yesterday's surge was driven by the same kind of herd mentality that propelled the earlier boom in internet stocks. </p> <p>Valuing internet stocks has always been tricky and has not become easier simply because prices have fallen. That said, investors need to do more than simply buy - or sell - the sector as if it were a single entity. It is made up of many companies with different strategies, managements and prospects. Investors need to differentiate between them. Otherwise the sector will remain fixed an a rollercoaster of boom and bust which will do little for companies or those who buy their shares. </p> <p><strong> Cross purposes </strong><br> </p> <p> Privatised utilities have had mixed reviews over the years but the City is warming to Centrica. Yesterday the news that it is taking its British Gas brand into the home telecoms market gave the shares another healthy fillip. </p> <p>The move is the latest extension of a strategy which is based on extracting maximum cross-selling from a brand portfolio which includes the AA and Goldfish credit cards, and which has seen the company make inroads into the electricity market. </p> <p>Centrica has some ambitious targets for its telecoms venture. It wants to sign up 1m subscribers by the end of next year and with that in mind is promising some hefty discounts compared to BT's prices, for example. </p> <p>That should be good news for customers. Whether or not Centrica meets its targets within the time frame it has set itself, the introduction of such a powerful player into the market is bound to exert downward pressure on prices. </p> <p>True, inertia is still a powerful factor in the utilities market but its impact can be overestimated. More and more households are getting used to changing providers - be it for energy or email - and will increasingly shop around for the best deals. </p> <p>But while Centrica is bringing welcome competition to a number of areas it is worth considering, if the process of utilities moving into new areas continues, whether there is a danger of replacing the old-style \" natural monopolies\" with a new breed of tough-to-take-on companies combining strong brands and millions of existing customers. </p> <p><strong> Fuelling debate </strong><br> </p> <p> Ali Rodriguez, Venezuela's oil minister as well as president of Opec, showed a neat sense of timing yesterday. </p> <p>Opec is under heavy pressure from the industrialised world to get the price of oil below the current $30-plus a barrel. But as he emerged from a meeting in Norway Mr Rodriguez sought to turn the tables on his critics. Industrialised countries should look to their own actions if they were so worried, he argued. Within the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, he said, tax accounted for 60% of the retail price of petrol, oil for 12%. </p> <p>On a day when French truckers besieged refineries and Irish hauliers demanded urgent talks with government, his comments had more resonance that might normally have been the case. </p> <p>But can governments in industrialised countries cut fuel taxes in the way Mr Rodriguez is suggesting? Despite generally buoyant government finances, the answer is probably not, though some countries may find a little room for manoeuvre. It is not just that oil taxes are a handy money spinner. Cutting the duty now would sit oddly with government initiatives to try to curb consumption and increase efficiency in the struggle against global warming.</p>"
