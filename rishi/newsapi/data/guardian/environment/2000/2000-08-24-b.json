  "<p> Warming up for Jamelia's debut show, a DJ deafens us with modern American R'n'B: hits from Destiny's Child, Q-Tip and Sisqo. Jamelia is a 19-year-old Brummie, hailed as Britain's R'n'B queen with chart successes Money and Call Me, but it's such glossy US expressions that she aspires to. </p> <p>Wailing sirens signal Jamelia's presence. Coloured spotlights sweep the stage as various session musicians and backing singers assemble. Does Jamelia make the flamboyant entrance worthy of a young R'n'B diva? No; she creeps in from the side, grinning bashfully. She looks fantastic, though: a vision in diamante, and her vocals cut smoothly and sweetly through a funky opener. </p> <p>Jamelia's set draws on her well-received album, Drama; the problem, however, is that drama is what she lacks. Things really go awry when she performs Call Me. It has a plush soul melody, with a sharply-choreographed video. Onstage, however, we're distracted by Jamelia's pubescent backing dancers, bounding all over the stage (and the song) like excitable puppies, affecting \"manly\" expressions. Luckily, they disappear for a bit after that, but the awkwardness persists. Although Jamelia exudes charm, vacillating from American vocals to introduce numbers in Birmingham brogue, she can't bring herself to make eye contact with the audience. </p> <p>Choosing this glamorous club venue for Jamelia's debut is a mistake; its age restrictions exclude the kids who buy her records (although, sadly, it hasn't deterred her backing dancers). Jamelia is essentially a pop star. She's an approachable pin-up and sings catchy tunes, but certain moments during this show almost swallow themselves with self- consciousness. Like when Jamelia raps that her \"Room 101\" is \"a little hideaway that nobody knows\" (so it's not an Orwellian nightmare, then). Or when a wooden guest vocalist joins her to cover Barbra Streisand's Guilty; he gets his chest out, but at least he looks past the age of consent. </p> <p>Jamelia plays her Baroque-swingbeat hit Money as an encore (with ragga hero Beenie Man on backing tapes), but she's clearly had more enjoyable appearances on CDUK. She'll prove she's capable of greater things when she performs with a tighter ensemble to a more responsive pop crowd. Right now, merely emulating American acts makes British R'n'B more shopping precinct than ghetto fabulous.</p>",
  "The Conservative party is currently torn by disagreement about the nature and content of its forthcoming election programme. There have been a series of changes in different areas of policy and in the party's approach to winning its way back into public esteem. There are furrowed brows in Conservative Central Office and long faces among the party's MPs. And no wonder. The Tories are in a mess and nothing that they are doing at the moment is likely to improve things. <p> One reason why this should be has come my way. It is not - alas - another sensational leak. It is not even a particularly impressive document. It is the transcript of part of a Question Time programme on BBC Television and it is the contribution to that programme by Amanda Platell, press secretary to William Hague. It was released by the Labour party to at least one other newspaper some days ago but very little attention was paid to it. I cannot imagine why not - it is extraordinarily revealing, in a number of different ways, about the nature of the political process. And about Ms Platell. </p> <p> First, an explanation which itself says much about the issues involved. Why was the Labour party in possession of this transcript? Perhaps they had asked the BBC for a copy because some bright spark at the party's headquarters in Millbank remembered that Amanda Platell had appeared on the programme and thought it might be worth finding out what she said in the hope of embarrassing the Tories? Wrong. The Labour party had this material because when Ms Platell was a guest on Question Time she was the Managing Editor of the Mirror Group of Newspapers and, in that responsible position, was briefed for the programme by the appropriate department within the Labour party itself. They made a recording and kept the transcript. </p> <p> But why did the briefing occur? Why would someone deemed smart enough to be the managing editor of anything - let alone a mass circulation tabloid newspaper - need to be briefed about what she thought about any area of current affairs? It might perhaps have been understandable if she had asked the public affairs department of MGN to furnish her privately with the up-to-date political position on the coal industry, care in the community or proportional representation before the programme. All of these subjects were among those discussed and were clearly in the news at the time. But it says something very bizarre about public affairs and the way current news issues are handled on television that it should be necessary for such a briefing to be offered by the Labour party and, even more, that it should be accepted by a high-profile public figure. </p> <p> It is known and understood by journalists that in the hermetic conditions of today's clinically controlled politics, most MPs are briefed to the eyeballs. Their bleepers tell them what to think and say about everything. Should they be invited to express their views in public and if, of course, their appearance is approved by their minders at HQ, they will secure a run-down from their own parties on the correct line to take on every subject before daring to tiptoe before a microphone. Anything to avoid the shame and horror of having to risk expressing any kind of individuality or personal political commitment. </p> <p> Yet it is rather odd to discover that this also extends to executives of the once great Mirror. The obvious implication is that Amanda Platell was expected to express views consistent with those supported by the Labour party, which was then in opposition. There is no date on the transcript but it seems evident from the context that the programme was broadcast some time in early 1993. But whenever it was, it will have been a relief to those involved on the party's side that Ms Platell performed her role to perfection. </p> <p> She spoke with sympathy about the problems of striking miners, forced to work extra hours for less pay by a (Conservative) government seeking to sell off their industry. She spoke powerfully about the Mirror's support for the leftwing. \"As long as we have breath,\" she said of her newspaper, \"it will continue to support the Labour party.\" She spoke of \"fighting against social injustice\", for the views of \"our readers\" who were Labour supporters. Later she boasted of the newspaper's coverage attacking the closure by the (Conservative) government of Westminster Hospital and how they had exposed the \"outrageous\" expenditure by Peter Lilley, the then (Conservative) secretary of state for social security on his travel to and from his home in France. </p> <p> She was a bit woolly about PR but said that \"you would not have had the poll tax in a million years if there had been any chance - if we'd had proportional representation.\" And she spoke about being \"terribly terribly worried\" walking down any street in this country and seeing \"people in doorways who obviously should be in hospitals, who should be in institutions and who've been kicked out by this (Conservative) government because they didn't have the funds to keep them in the hospitals.\" </p> <p> Now I have no idea whether Amanda Platell believed what she was saying when she said it, but I rather suspect that she cannot possibly have done so. She doesn't express herself particularly well or fluently and there is no indication that she has actually thought through any of the points that she made on the programme, let alone believed them. </p> <p> What really is astonishing is that we have a political system which makes it possible for someone who was, relatively recently, prepared to go on television and mouth ill-considered thoughts on behalf of one of our major parties, shortly before she was to become the press secretary to the leader of the other. Admittedly William Hague was only joint parliamentary under-secretary at the Department of Social Security in 1993 - the job politicians laugh about as arguably being the least desirable on offer - but he was only two years away from promotion to the cabinet and only four from the leadership. </p> <p> The metamorphosis of Amanda Platell is a small but depressing episode. One of the truly surprising things about the state of our political parties at present is the lack of serious attention that any of those involved in running affairs seems to pay to the important business of sincerity. </p> <p> It is difficult to under-estimate how much this matters to the electorate. Time and again opinion polls demonstrate that what chimes best with the public is a politician who is palpably honest and human and who tells the truth. It may not be about something with which everyone will necessarily agree. That doesn't matter at all. It is the sincerity that matters. But people like Amanda Platell treat such matters with careless disdain. Since she is now running press relations at Conservative Central Office, is it any wonder that they are in such a mess?</p>",
  "<p>Scotland Yard has sent a team of officers to Prague ahead of next month's IMF and World Bank annual summit amid fears of violent anti-capitalist demonstrations by up to 50,000 protesters, including many of those involved in the May Day riots in London. </p> <p>Special Branch has been liaising with its counterpart in the Czech Republic and four officers from Scotland Yard's public order unit, led by Chief Supt Steve French, flew to the capital last week for two days of talks with police chiefs. </p> <p>Files and photographs of demonstrators who incited the trouble in London have been offered to the Czech authorities, as well as intelligence on potential troublemakers. </p> <p>Although the Czechs have insisted that they are confident of coordinating the security operation and are sensitive about asking for outside help, the republic has turned to Britain and the United States for advice because of fears the Prague demonstrations could be the worst so far. </p> <p>Earlier this year 24 senior Czech officers were sent to the FBI's headquarters in Washington for training. Three months ago the agency's director, Louis Freeh, went to Prague to discuss contingency plans if violence flares. The Czechs have also been working with Interpol in the hope of identifying protesters from Germany, Poland and Scandinavia. </p> <p>Concern has been mounting because of the way anti-globalisation campaigners have disrupted major conferences in recent years. </p> <p>There were riots at last November's World Trade Organisation summit in Seattle, and at an IMF/World Bank meeting in Washington last April. </p> <p>Even though the Metropolitan police cancelled all leave for the May Day protests and swamped the capital with thousands of officers and undercover \"spotters\", demonstrators managed to dig up the grassy area of Parliament Square, daub paint and graffiti on monuments, including the Cenotaph and a statue of Sir Winston Churchill. More than 100 people were charged. </p> <p>The delegation from Scotland Yard, which included a specialist in media management, flew to Prague last week. </p> <p>\"We went over to help them, though officially Prague did not ask for our assistance. We wanted to share our experiences and our information,\" said a Scotland Yard source. </p> <p>The British embassy in Prague yesterday also confirmed that there had been \"contact\" between senior detectives in both countries. </p> <p>The Foreign Office is advising Britons against holiday and non-essential travel to Prague between September 23 and September 28. The US state department has also advised Americans not to visit the city at the end of September. </p> <p>Although the Czech interior ministry has told Prague's residents to \"relax and put your faith in the authorities\", the build-up to the summit has convinced many that violence in inevitable. </p> <p>Eleven thousand police have been assigned to the event and 5,000 soldiers will be on standby. </p> <p>The health ministry has warned Prague's four main hospitals to prepare for the worst. They are taking on extra staff and will be stocked with drugs to combat biological and chemical attacks. </p> <p>Keeping wounded delegates and protesters apart is another practical concern. </p> <p>\"If you have the delegates in one room and the protesters in another, they could fight in the corridor,\" warned a doctor at the Kralovske Vinohrady Teaching Hospital, which has set aside three luxury bedrooms for high profile financiers. </p> <p>Fast food restaurants have already ordered replacement panes of glass, knowing they are likely to be targeted. </p> <p>Managers of the supermarket chain, Tesco, which has a large branch in the centre of Prague, say they are considering closing during the summit. </p> <p>Schools and theatres in the centre of the capital have been ordered to close and Prague residents have been advised it may be wise to leave the capital or stock up on medicines and food and stay at home. </p> <p>Tabloid newspapers have added to the growing alarm by telling people to barricade their doors and windows against the \"barbarian protesters.\" </p> <p>Around 800 safety vests are to be handed out to journalists covering the summit, which is due to be attended by 23,000 delegates and politicians. </p> <p>Scores of British protesters have already moved to Prague and hundreds more are expected to arrive in the next fortnight. </p> <p>In the recent demonstrations in Britain and the US, police were accused of underestimating the resourcefulness and determination of the demonstrators and of showing little understanding of the loose-knit groupings suspected of masterminding the violence. </p> <p>Most police attention has focused on a coalition of Czech environmental, human rights and anarchist groups, called Inpeg, Initiative Against Economic Globalisation, which plans a counter summit at the same time as the financial meeting. But Inpeg has described the police's plans as \"hysterical\" and insist it is preparing \"non-violent activist training.\" </p> <p>With growing trepidation, the police have also been monitoring the numerous websites that have sprung up in recent weeks urging protesters to head for Prague. One of the websites, called DestroyIMF, urges participation in S26 - the demonstrators' nickname for the event. </p> <p>\"We're going to Prague to make the IMF summit in September 2000 into Seattle II. The IMF summit will be protected by a Czech police operation run by the FBI. The challenge to the workers' movement is to shutdown that summit with the biggest demo Europe has ever seen.\" </p> <p>It adds: \"We don't just want to disrupt their summits - we want to scrap the profit system that allows institutions like the World Bank, the IMF and WTO to rule the world and the former Stalinist countries. We want to end debt, poverty and capitalist exploitation. This site is a protest portal.\" Protesters have been advised of the Czech for useful phrases such as \"You fascist pig\" and \"Where is the nearest McDonalds?\" </p> <p>Police are also worried that protesters will target a new nuclear power plant in Bohemia which is due to be activated around the time of the IMF conference. </p> <p>The Czech president, Vaclev Havel, has tried to downplay concern, criticising the coverage given to security arrangements. He said: \"It is as if we were getting ready for a civil war.\" </p> <p> <strong> A world of protest against the global economy</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> June 18 1999</strong> </p> <p>Demonstrations were held in 27 cities worldwide, from the Czech Republic to Nigeria, in what was dubbed the \"global carnival against capital\". </p> <p>In the City of London, the 3,000-strong peaceful protest turned into the worst riots seen in the capital since the poll tax demonstration of 1990, resulting in 46 people needing hospital treatment and an estimated bill of more than \u00a35m. </p> <p><strong> November 30 1999</strong> </p> <p>The biggest protest in the US since the Vietnam war took place on the streets of Seattle, where the World Trade Organisation was meeting. </p> <p>An estimated 100,000 people protested peacefully until masked activists hijacked the demonstration and police in full riot gear responded with teargas and rubber pellets. </p> <p>A smaller protest of 2,000 people at Euston station in London led to 40 arrests. </p> <p><strong> April 16-17 2000</strong> </p> <p>Anti-globalisation protesters descended on Washington to disrupt meetings of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. Between 6,000 and 10,000 people managed to close the American capital for six hours and the human chain prevented some finance ministers from getting to their meetings. </p> <p>Largely peaceful but violent clashes with police officers - many in riot gear, which had them being compared to Power Rangers - resulted in 600 arrests. </p> <p><strong> May 1 2000</strong> </p> <p>May Day protests took place around the world. In London, where 4,000 people took to the streets, activists performed \"guerrilla gardening\" in Parliament Square and daubed paint and graffiti on monuments. What had been planned as peaceful protests ended in ugly scenes and 42 arrests. </p> <p><strong> August 15 2000</strong> </p> <p>Rubber bullets were fired by police in Los Angeles at the end of a protest concert by the band Rage Against the Machine. A total of 39 people were arrested in four days in a series of protests against corporate greed. </p> <p><strong> Sally James Gregory</strong></p>",
  "The unsavoury saga of the British treatment of the Diego Garcia islanders took a new twist yesterday when an unpublished report commissioned by the Foreign Office supported their case to return home. <p>The feasibility report severely undermines the position taken by the Foreign Office, which is fighting a high court action by the islanders, who were forced from the Indian ocean territory in 1973 in order to make way for a US air and naval base. </p> <p>The \u00a355,000 report, commissioned from independent consultants by the Foreign Office in March and completed in June, concludes that \"resettlement of one or both of the atolls is physically possible\". </p> <p>That 123-page document, instead of being published, was buried in the House of Commons library at the end of July, just as MPs were disappearing for the summer recess. </p> <p>In July the islanders brought an action in the high court in London, demanding to be allowed to return to two islands neighbouring Diego Garcia: Salomons and Peros Banhos. </p> <p>A Foreign Office spokeswoman said yesterday she was unable to comment as the issue was still sub judice. Following a week of hearings in July, a court judgment is expected early in October. </p> <p>Richard Gifford, the lawyer for the islanders, described the Foreign Office's attempt to obstruct the islanders from returning as \"nonsense. We are not just talking about populating islands but repopulating them. There were lots of people living there before.\" </p> <p>Most of the islanders were resettled on Mauritius and the remainder in the Seychelles, but both groups have had difficulty in assimilating. The Foreign Office is sceptical about how many would want to return but Mr Gifford said that of 3,800 people who responded to a questionnaire in Mauritius, only one did not want to return. A further 500 exiles live in the Seychelles. </p> <p>He described the report as \"a first step to implementing a return\", adding: \"The Foreign Office is obviously very cagey about costs but essentially it is quite possible.\" </p> <p>The foreign secretary, Robin Cook, and his ministers are believed to be uncomfortable with the issue given the islands' disreputable colonial history. But they believe that they have to deal with the world as it is, rather than as it was. </p> <p>The islands are among only a dozen overseas territories controlled by Britain, the remnants of the empire. </p> <p>The Foreign Office is in a bind because it has leased the islands to the US for 50 years, with an option of extending. Although the base - used by B52 bombers during the Gulf war - is on Diego Garcia, the US says it does not want people on the neighbouring islands for security reasons. </p> <p>The Foreign Office is also arguing that, after being uninhabited for 30 years, there are feasibility problems about resettlement. This is why it ordered the independent report. </p> <p>The report, The Resettlement of the Salomons and Peros Banhos Atolls, was written by five consultants: an environmentalist, an economist, a fisheries expert, a water engineer and a natural resources expert. </p> <p>They went to the islands from May 9- 14. The main concerns were whether there was a proper water supply, whether the necessary infrastructure could be built and the prospects for a viable economy. </p> <p>The consultants concluded resettlement was possible, provided various conditions were met. These included confirmation that a sustainable and affordable water supply can be developed. They found fresh water but further studies would be needed to determine if there was enough. They said alternative ways of supplying water could be found. </p> <p>Other conditions were: that the environment was not damaged; that public money was available to finance infrastructure; and that one or more private investors were willing to develop viable enterprises. </p> <p>The report suggested various proposals for generating economic activity, including tourism. \"There is some potential for low-level tourist-based development, even if an airport is not built.\" </p> <p>This could include offering services to visiting diving safaris and yachtsmen. However, this would provide only a small number of jobs. </p> <p>\"Fisheries development appears to be the best potential to support a settled population,\" the report said. If the owner of a mother vessel in Mauritius was to switch operations to the islands, direct employment could be provided for up to 60 fishermen. Support services would provide further jobs.</p>",
  "<p> The first wedding in England and Wales to be broadcast on the internet from a council register office was held this morning at Brent Town Hall, north-west London. </p> <p>Brent Council installed a web cam in its register office, allowing a potential global audience of millions to log on as Ravi Ram and his girlfriend Mamta Patel take their vows. </p> <p>From now on, the council plans to allow all weddings in the borough's register office to be broadcast online at no extra cost. </p> <p>\"The idea is that if your family are abroad or cannot get to the ceremony they can see the wedding take place,\" said Pascoe Sawyers. </p> <p>Mr Sawyers said the cost to council taxpayers will be minimal. \"We have all the facilities set up - it is just the cost of a camera,\" he said. </p> <p>About 30 non-virtual guests will attend the wedding of Ravi Ram, a psychiatric nurse from Harrow, north west London, and his girlfriend of three years Mamta Patel, 24, assistant manager at a residential home. </p> <p>However, dozens more friends and family will be logging on to watch the event from Mr Ram's homeland of Mauritius. His sister, Doorga, a social work student, will watch the wedding in cyberspace from the University of Mauritius. </p> <p>Mr Ram said: \"Doorga is still studying, so she couldn't make it to the wedding - the web cam is the perfect way for her to be part of the ceremony. </p> <p>Miss Patel however said her family in Gujarat, India, would not be able to take advantage of the on-line ceremony.</p> <p>She said: \"I've got a lot of uncles, aunts and cousins in Gujarat but they are all in tiny little villages. </p> <p>\"But I've got friends abroad, especially in the US, who will be watching the wedding on the net.\" </p> <p>The couple's wedding ceremony comes before a full traditional Hindu wedding in Wembley at the weekend with more than 300 guests </p> <p>The Chief Registrar for Brent Council, Mark Rimmer, said the idea had come from a New Zealand couple: \"This couple wanted to let their families back home in New Zealand watch their ceremony and share their special day. </p> <p>\"At the time we didn't have web cam facilities and instead they ended up ringing home on three or four mobile phones which let the people back home listen to the marriage ceremony.\" </p> <p>For the time being the images are still pictures, updated every 15 seconds, which are immediately transferred to the <a href=\"http://www.brent.gov.uk/reg\">Brent Council website</a>.</p> <p>Mr Rimmer said: \"At the moment it broadcasts still pictures which are refreshed about every 15 seconds, but we are looking to set it up so it will be broadcast live as it happens - with sound and everything.</p>",

  "<p>If all flesh is grass, then it makes sense to take care of the lawn. And all flesh truly is grass. If you could weigh every human and all their domestic livestock, the scales would tip at 1.1bn tons - and every ounce of this living flesh depends on plant life. Humans are not just leaders in the field, they and their livestock consume most of the field. </p> <p>Consume is the word. There could be about 270,000 species of flowering plants already named, and perhaps another 50,000 to be identified. And, says Peter Crane, director of the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew in London, around 30% of them are threatened. A quarter of them could vanish within 50 years. </p> <p>Which is why he is about to formally open a new kind of world bank to store the seeds of plants at risk for up to 200 years and push for yet more research into the green things that bankroll all animal life. Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and the food they eat, the medicines they use, the clothes they wear and the shelters in which they live. </p> <p>The odd thing is that after millennia of co-existence, most humans know very little about them. Only about 7,000 species of plant have been gathered or cultivated, a mere 200 have been domesticated and around a dozen of them provide 75% of the world's calories. Two of them, rice and wheat, produce - directly - 45% of the world's protein. Indirectly, of course, plants provide all of it. </p> <p>These brutal economic facts make research institutions such as Kew the keepers of the planet's future. It is not the only important botanical gardens - there is a network of them, co-operating in research - but it is the tallest poppy in the meadow. Its \u00a380m millennium seed bank at Wakehurst Place in Sussex is about to open to the public. </p> <p>It already holds seeds from most of Britain's flora and for the next nine years Kew's scientists will be out in the field collecting tens of thousands of specimens to be dried, and kept at sub-zero temperatures, to be taken out again and grown and gathered and frozen again - a kind of vegetable Noah's Ark, to save species otherwise doomed by human expansion into the wilderness. </p> <p>Many of them will be from the dry lands, the regions of the earth where plants are already most at risk and humans struggle every day for survival. \"Why should we care?\" says Crane. \"Someone like me who sees what we have today as the product of tens of millions of years of evolution asks: is it really rational to allow, in a space of a couple of generations, such a catastrophic change to occur? I think there is an ethical, moral issue there that has to do with our place in nature and the way we view ourselves and our general stewardship of the planet, these sorts of things. For me that is a pretty powerful argument. For some people that wouldn't cut a lot of ice. But for me there is a justification for pausing a moment and saying: is this rational? Do we want to wreak these kinds of irreversible changes?\" </p> <p>He has seen such changes already. His first business was palaeobotany. He worked in the Field Museum in Chicago on fossil plants. Flowering plants began to bloom on the planet only about 130m years ago, and soon trees related to magnolias, and precursors of the walnut and the oak were co-existing with the dinosaurs. There were palms, dogwoods, gingers and a diversity of other things. There were no grasses - the precursors of the wheats and ryes and cocksfoots that feed the world turned up only 30m years ago - but the shales and coal measures and chalk deposits kept producing evidence of an enduring and slowly altering kingdom, flowering into greater and greater diversity. </p> <p>From Chicago, Crane - born in Britain, educated at Reading, 45, and married with two children - moved to take over Kew and his view switched from the past to the future. What he saw - what any biologist would have seen - was a massacre of living things, a huge narrowing of green diversity. </p> <p>\"In the western world we are very insulated from nature, or at least we tend to think we are. Our day to day reliance on plant diversity is not the same as it is in other places,\" he says. \"But they reckon that 80% of the world is still reliant on plant resources for its primary health care.\" </p> <p>He has just come back from a visit to a co-operative project in the dry lands of north-east Brazil. \"They don't have the money to pay the bus to go to the hospital. If they go to the hospital they haven't the money to pay for the drugs they need. So they grow medicinal plants in their gardens and those medicinal plants help them through the less serious parts of their health care needs. They are very, very important. Intestinal parasites, for instance: there are lots of plants they use as purgatives. Curiously enough we are seeing the same trend here, with Chinese herbalists.\" </p> <p>Diversity pays dividends in all sorts of ways. An enthusiastic British gardener might have a dozen species of useful plants on his plot. An African or Latin American family might have more than 100: when the game is uncertain, it pays to spread your bets. The botanists went to Brazil to help, but they also went to learn. One farmer in the Brazilian drylands had found a new way with a neglected resource, Crane says. </p> <p>\"He was growing cattle, but they basically don't have enough water. So periodically he has nothing to feed these things, so he was very interested in how you get through the bad times. One of the things they had been working on in these groups was the use of cacti for the boundary fences. He was using three or four different species of cacti for keeping animals out of growing areas but what he had also found out was he could harvest these cacti as food for his animals. In the ordinary course of events he wouldn't be feeding his animals cacti, but when things get really rough he can almost coppice them, get the spines off them and have good, short-term animal fodder. It's pretty nutritious.\" </p> <p>The tropical wet forests are disappearing because of ruthless commercial exploitation of hardwoods and colonisation by desperate farmers. In the drylands, plants are perishing because people are struggling to survive: their cattle clear the landscape and the farmers collect what is left as fuel because they have no other choice. Greed and poverty are one set of enemies, human movement is another, as lusty foreign species take over in precarious ecosystems. The only way ahead is to work with the people who depend on their local flora - and collect like mad for the millennium seed bank. </p> <p>\"It's a fairly last-ditch approach,\" says Crane. \"It's better to conserve the plants in the field in which they grow, and they might support the eco-system they support, or on which they depend. But in a lot of cases it's a matter of saying: let's get these things into a safe haven, that we can then use in the future for reintroduction, before they diminish to such a level that either the genetic diversity has been stripped out, or they have gone more or less completely.\" </p> <p>A seed bank exhibition opens to the public at Wakehurst Place, Ardingley, Sussex (01444 894 000) on Saturday.

  "Your front-page headline and first paragraph yesterday (Polar data left unused) give the false impression that data on ice thickness released to us by the Navy are lying unused for lack of funding from Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) for data processing. The comment which I made to your reporter was that we have received funding for 18 months to begin the processing of these data, with the likelihood that further funding may follow. <p>It is certainly the case that the vital task of collecting and processing critical data on global change requires long-term funding support, rather than short-term grants, because of the need for salary support to retain the skills of experienced people in a research team, and the fact that the changes being mapped are progressive and require successive field expeditions for their measurement. In this respect there has been a problem with funding agencies (not just NERC), which tend to shy away from long-term support for such areas of research. It is fair to say that these attitudes are changing. </p> <p>Dr Peter Wadhams, Scott Polar Research Institute, University of Cambridge</p>",
  "Any rebranding of the Department of Trade and Industry (Towards a second term, August 21) should not forget a crucial element in the success of the UK economy: the UK's 60m consumers who spend over \u00a3400bn a year on goods and services. Crucial to a successful business environment is ensuring consumers feel confident to deal in the market place and are sufficiently protected when they do. <p>Significant steps have been taken. The government has reformed competition laws, improved the rules that protect consumers from unfair terms in contracts and given a stronger consumer focus to energy regulation. We are hoping for a bill in the Queen's Speech to toughen laws for dealing with cowboy traders. Significantly, the government published the first consumer white paper for more than 20 years. </p> <p>Victor Keegan is right to highlight communications. But the next stage is to broaden the focus of the department's activities. If anything, the DTI should be rebranded the Department for Consumers and Industry. </p> <p>Andrew Barnett, National Consumer Council </p> <p>\u0095In a converging and rapidly changing communications industry, it is important that the consumer voice is heard across all communications sectors. Victor Keegan proposes turning off the analogue television signal as soon as possible, but government must balance the interests of consumers and industry. Forcing all consumers to pay for costly new equipment to receive extra services they may not want would not be the action of a responsible government. </p> <p>Analogue switch-off and more competition in telecommunications, following local loop unbundling, are signs of the pace of change in the industry. They also point to a third urgent policy initiative. The DTI should set up a dedicated Communications Consumer Council to ensure that a strong and clear consumer voice is heard amid the industry clamour as UK communications converge. This should be central to the government's long-anticipated communications white paper, which is likely to shape the future of the industry. </p> <p>Michelle Childs, Consumers' Association </p>",
  "Work-life balance was a little known concept at the start of the 90s. By the end of the decade it was tripping off the tongue of every politician, policy-maker and commentator. It labelled one of the most prevalent forms of millennial angst: that while Britain may have achieved low inflation growth, it had paid a heavy price in terms of the well-being of our families and ourselves. We worried that we had the highest divorce rate and the longest working hours in Europe, and that the two statistics were linked. Beyond them, lay worse: the highest number of single parents and the largest proportion of children living in poverty. <p>There has been no shortage of genuine concern within the government. Harriet Harman was at the forefront of initiatives to ease the pressures on working mothers. That is what makes her leaked memo yesterday, warning of the difficulties of extending parental leave for small businesses, all the more surprising. One never expected Ms Harman to be the one to call for a slow-down. But her old friend, Patricia Hewitt at the Department of Trade and Industry, is under acute pressure from small businesses ahead of the green paper on parental rights due in the autumn. </p> <p>Ms Harman's concerns are taken further in an Industrial Society pamphlet, \"Mothers versus men\", published yesterday. It argues that the current structure of maternity leave can backfire, opening women up to discrimination. Prospective employers can be deterred from employing, training or promoting women because of the costs and inconveniences of their maternity rights. This is where the pattern of discrimination sets in, setting men and women on radically different career trajectories, which results in the stubborn 20% pay gap between women and men. Motherhood, it concludes, carries a heavy penalty in earning power. </p> <p>The solution to inequality in the workplace, the pamphlet claims, is to institute equality in the home. Everything else has been tried to reduce the pay gap the equal pay act, corporate and government initiatives... Now, we must go radical. The priority for campaigners, it argues, should be to equalise parental rights rather than extending maternity rights. Only when men are encouraged to take a fuller role in the care of children - equality in the home - will there be equality in the workplace. And to ensure that the message gets out loud and clear from the top of every organisation, the government should offer 90% of take home pay even to top executives for six weeks' parental leave. Level the playing field. </p> <p>This is wonderful stuff. The kids would love dad around. What woman would not love her partner to pitch in, keep track of the children's inoculations, remember their PE kit - in short, apply some of their management skills to their home life? If men devoted as much time and energy to parenting as women do, it would certainly undermine patterns of discrimination and revolutionise our work culture into becoming less pressurised and more family-friendly. But this thinking is close to utopian. It ignores a quickening global economy and technological change which have considerably increased the pressures on employees. It overlooks the choices men are making every day to work long hours, thus missing the school-run and bathtime: male identity is still powerfully linked to the competitiveness and ambition of the office. Until that alters, giving men generous paternity leave instead of extending women's maternity leave would be a waste of legislative effort.</p>",
  "<p>Try to land on the surface of the moon or Mars, and the force of gravity will bring you in uncomfortably fast. That makes retrorockets necessary, or some other mechanism to cushion the impact. But landing on an asteroid or comet presents the converse problem: the target's mass is too low to generate any substantial gravitational pull, and so you may simply float off. </p> <p>Up until now this has only been a concern for Hollywood scriptwriters (as in the movies Deep Impact and Armageddon) and they tend to circumvent the problem by ignoring the laws of physics. But now there are plans to send various spacecraft to explore the surfaces of asteroids and comets, and so a real scientific fix is needed. </p> <p>The American Near-Shoemaker probe was placed in orbit around an asteroid called Eros six months ago. Eros, at 20 miles across, is fairly large as such things go, and so exerts sufficient gravitational pull for Near's masters to work against, letting their satellite circuit this rocky body and move in and out to take a closer look. Eventually they will let Near-Shoemaker drop down low, and perhaps nestle into the dusty surface of Eros. Barring some disaster with its thrusters, the probe will make a soft landing. </p> <p>Due for launch in 2003, but taking eight years to get to its prime target, is the European Space Agency's Rosetta probe. When it eventually approaches comet Wirtanen in 2011, the mother craft will drop a module named RoLand. The comet is small, and so has low gravity. In addition to that, ice and other volatile materials sublimating from the surface of a comet produce an expanding vapour cloud, which could push RoLand away. The trick will be first to get down to the surface, and then to grapple with it, or anchor itself down. That accomplished, samples will be taken and the behaviour of the comet monitored as it comes closer to the sun over the following two years. </p> <p>Before Rosetta gets to its comet, Japan plans to send a probe to perform a cosmic pirouette with a near-earth asteroid. Both the spacecraft and the asteroid have names that are hardly prosaic: the former is called Muses-C, while the latter is stored as 1998 SF36 in the astronomers' data banks. </p> <p>The asteroid will eventually be given a more memorable name. It was discovered by an American search team from New Mexico in late 1998, and eventually it will have its orbit determined with sufficient precision to allow a proper moniker to be allocated. Astronomers don't like to give objects names until they are sure they have enough data so as not to lose them amongst the myriad stars. As the target of a space mission, plenty of telescopes will be keeping track of 1998 SF36. </p> <p>Muses-C is due for launch in November or December 2002, getting to its destination three years later. Two small landing modules are planned. One is a Japanese device named Minerva, while Nasa has built a tiny rover currently called Muses-CN; again, one would imagine that a more prosaic appellation will be found for it soon. </p> <p>This little critter is only the size of a shoebox, and so is often termed a nanorover (hence the N in the name). The plan is that it will navigate around the asteroid surface not so much by turning its wheels, but more by jumping like a grasshopper. </p> <p>Everyone knows that when Neil Armstrong stepped onto the lunar surface, he spoke of a \"giant leap for mankind.\" Subsequent Apollo astronauts illustrated that by bounding for the benefit of the television cameras, showing that in the low gravity of the moon it is easier to take twin-footed bounds than to walk. On an asteroid the situation is more extreme, and an astronaut would be able to jump off it, never to return. </p> <p>Low gravity is a drawback even for a robotic system. It means that the tiny wheels of Muses-C would not be able to get much traction. Instead, the idea is that the pivoting front and back pairs of wheels will spring together to provide an upward thrust, pushing the rover off the asteroid with a leap of a hundred yards or so. </p> <p>In this low-g environment, everything seems to happen slowly. The rover will take several minutes to rise on its trajectory, and then gradually fall back to the surface. But it won't land on the spot where it started. Asteroids spin on their axes every few hours. During the rover's leap into space, the asteroid will have turned, and so the rover will land perhaps a quarter of a mile away, take a look with its tiny camera, and then jump again. In this way a wide range of surface locations will be examined and compared. </p> <p>But what if the rover lands on its back? Will it struggle to right itself like an upturned beetle? They got round that by making Muses-CN a reversible vehicle: it has solar cells on top and bottom, so it makes no difference which way up it lands. </p> <p>If a ride on a helter-skelter makes you feel dizzy, spare a thought for this poor little fellow. Repeatedly kicking itself out into space, and then slowly tumbling back again, its gyrations will make even the multiple somersaults of Olympic divers and gymnasts look trivial. But it does have the advantage of low gravity, and so no hard landings. </p> <p> \u0095 Duncan Steel researches asteroids and comets at the University of Salford</p>",
  "On the face of it, the new economy looks like a nirvana for women. The skills required for success are cerebral (ideas generation, IT knowledge) or semi-social (networking, team-building). And the entrepreneurial spirit required to jump the \"not com\" old economy corporate ship and establish a start-up seems to reside in the X chromosome: women in the United States are in the forefront of new business creation and British women are not far behind. <p>The technological slaying of distance, with websites and email allowing new economy recruits to work as and where they please, is particularly helpful to women trying to marry paid work with childcare. Throw in some glamour in the shape of Martha Lane Fox, and the feminisation of the new economy seems complete. Women sick of banging their heads against the glass ceilings of the old economy can give it up as a bad job and join the flexible, gender-neutral new one instead. </p> <p>Only things aren't quite as they seem. The surface impression of a new dawn of gender equality does not fit with the reality of the changing economy. Helen Wilkinson, a writer on gender and technology, argues that a harsher dot.com environment means women are struggling to establish themselves in start-ups. \"The new economy looks good for women on paper - technology allows new ways of working, creating the potential for better work-life balance,\" she says. \"But start-ups require a huge initial investment of time and energy, meaning long working hours. The dot.com culture is still quite male-oriented and in a climate in which investors are cautious, there is a tendency to go with safe options.\" </p> <p>Wilkinson points out that the venture capital firms backing dot.com start-ups in Britain are dominated by men; the specific IT skills required for website building and e-commerce are still being acquired by more men than women - indeed the number of women applying to study IT has dropped slightly. And while the image of the new economy worker logging on from home seems attractive, the truth is less futuristic: a study by the Institute for Employment Studies found that women telecommuters were three times more likely than men to be interrupted by children. </p> <p>Perhaps, most importantly, the working culture of dot.coms is more macho than the old economy, with the possible exception of City trading rooms. Start-ups operate in a go-go, flat-out climate, and the line between success and failure is often so narrow - and the gains from stocks options so great - that working all the hours God sends is entirely rational. Far from prefiguring a feminine future, dot.commery is fuelled by testosterone and takeaways, with friends and lovers found in the late-night office and \"start-up sex\" made more exciting by the shared sense of pace and risk in many e-ventures. </p> <p>In the United States there are signs of a backlash against start-up craziness. The initiatives to reduce pressure on employees speak volumes about the levels of insanity. Justin Kitch, founder of Homestead.com, decided to rebalance his life when he got married, cutting back his office hours to just 60 and putting in, on top, a mere 20 at home. Charlie Kim, head of Next Jump, which produces online college guides, told Fast Company magazine he was cracking down on long hours by banning sleeping in the office </p> <p>In Britain, too, the atmosphere of dot.coms remains relentlessly macho. Employees boast of pulling \"all-nighters\" - an activity once reserved for just-in-time essay production at university. </p> <p>Of course, it is not just men who are adopting a work-all-hours approach: Lane Fox, of lastminute.com, herself rises at dawn, rushes around until dusk and puts in more work in between than most of us manage in a week. Which is fine until children appear on the scene, because women still have most of the childcare responsibilities and the dot.com culture is about as family-unfriendly as you can get. </p> <p>Without giving up their command of the old economy, men are colonising the new one, too. Far from narrowing the gap between men and women, the rise of the dot.com is in danger of widening it. So much for e-quality. </p> <p> Richard Reeves is director of futures at the Industrial Society</p>",
  "<p>Those of you who have followed this column for any length of time know that I resent the way business has taken over the internet. Since 1994, when the international research communications infrastructure was officially opened to business, I've critiqued what has appeared to me to be a degradation of the content, spirit, and mission of the interactive space. </p> <p>Well, I'm done complaining. Do not worry - I'm still as anti-corporate as the next guy. If anything, I have become so anti-corporate that I do not mind exploiting them as much as they think they are exploiting us. They mean to take as much as they can get from us, so what is so terrible about our taking whatever we can get from them? In other words: why not let big business build our internet? </p> <p>They will not make any money from it, in the long run. In fact, no one has yet developed a truly profitable business plan for the internet. Not the online magazines of the mid-90s (no revenue), the e-commerce companies of the late-90s (no margins), or the streaming media sites of the early \"broadband\" 2000s (no one cares). </p> <p>The only people who have taken home any profits are the speculators who buy stock in these schemes - and then sell it to less crafty speculators before the schemes crash. The other folks who make money, of course, are the legions of advisors, brokers and consultants, who are busy leading everyone else to their doom. And a couple of monopolies. </p> <p>In the meantime, at least some portion of the countless investment dollars pouring into the internet is going towards building the infrastructure itself. Telephone companies are developing faster, cheaper ways of increasing data rates, while cable TV companies work to expand bandwidth. Others are laying fibre-optic, launching satellites, miniaturising cell phones, and integrating databases. </p> <p>For the past five years or so, those of us who were aware of how little money could actually be made on truly interactive experiences have attempted to pop the stock market bubble that has formed around it. We know that internet investing is essentially a pyramid scheme, and that there are not enough eyeball-hours in a day to justify even today's, slightly deflated, dot.com valuations. </p> <p>So we whine on about how big business does not belong online, will not really make any money, and should leave us all alone to play and inter act in our publicly owned, civil-minded datasphere. What are we, crazy? </p> <p>I remember a time, not so long ago, when we were begging for big business to come onboard. In the early 90s, before the world wide web even existed, internet enthusiasts would get laughed out of conference rooms for suggesting that any real companies might want to get involved in the interactive age. My first book on the internet was cancelled before it hit the press in 1993, because the publisher feared the \"fad\" would be over before the ink had dried. (The book came out a year later.) </p> <p>Once big business came online, most of us early proselytisers changed our tune to gloom and doom. True enough, the internet was pillaged. It became a strip mall of epic proportions, and many people logging on today get no sense of the opportunity a communications infrastructure might offer for the formation of a global society. </p> <p>But maybe we should keep our eyes on that prize. Thanks to the shortsighted, profit-driven motives of mindless corporations, the internet is cheaper to use, more widely available, and spreading faster than ever before. \"Developing\" regions and former Soviet-bloc nations are the next target market, and we can only imagine the sorts of incentives being formulated to turn folks who have never even made a phone call into internet users. </p> <p>Our tragic error has been to resent the people who have made money from the internet so far. Who cares if they get extremely wealthy? So what if the real estate prices in New York, San Francisco and London go up? This is a decentralised society we are building, anyway. </p> <p>The dot.com investors' belief in the false scarcity of urban real estate is no different than their allegiance to the finite dot.com naming scheme. It's competition that dominates their thinking, which is why they will never really understand their Holy Grail of \"online community\". </p> <p>We want to crash the market and pop the bubble because we hate the poor fools who have seemingly taken over the digital landscape and gotten rich off a set of technologies they only mean to misuse. The recent correction in stock values is a clear indication that our message has been heard. Well, aren't we the kind ones? </p> <p>I propose we chart a different course. Let's encourage business to invest in the internet, and to build an open infrastructure that will someday allow the whole world to play a glorious networked game with itself or, better, find ways to interact other than through money or munitions. Let's milk every last drop from the corporate cows before they figure out they've been nourishing an infant who means to swallow them whole.</p>",
