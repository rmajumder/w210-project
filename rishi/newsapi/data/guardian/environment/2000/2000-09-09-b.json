  "<p>Idaho seems to do a good job of keeping its natural treasures hidden from the rest of the world. Who would think, for instance, that the Potato State has more officially-designated Wilderness Areas than anywhere else in the US outside of Alaska? </p> <p>The Middle Fork of the Salmon River flows right through the centre of one of these, the Frank Church - River of No Return Wilderness Area. It ranks high among white-water rafters and kayakers, not so much for the ferocity of its rapids or the difficulty of negotiating them as for the constant and regular flow of the water throughout its 100-mile length - there are very few areas of slack water. Then there's the huge variety of scenery and wildlife you encounter as you descend from the \"put-in\" point at 6,000ft-high Boundary Creek to the \"take out\", 3,000ft below at the confluence with the main Salmon. </p> <p>The relative lack of really serious white-water means that the river is accessible to pretty much anyone with a sense of adventure - I was on a six-day trip with a group of Texans all of whom were the wrong side of 40, and all of whom had a great time. </p> <p>At the put-in point, the Middle Fork would be unlikely to get anyone too excited - generally narrow and shallow, this is not the kind of whitewater maelstrom you see on all the raft ing posters. What you get instead is inspiring mountain scenery on either side of the river. Even in July, there are snow patches on the highest of the peaks, which rise up to between 7,000ft and 9,000ft, and you may spot any number of wild creatures ambling along the river banks, including black bears, deer, elk, big horn sheep, and, if you're really lucky, cougars, grizzlies and wolves. </p> <p>The upper part of the river is quite mellow, and there are plenty of opportunities to sit back in your raft and watch the landscape drift by, or hang a line over the side and wait for a salmon or trout to bite (although being a Wilderness Area, all fish are taken on a catch-and-release basis). At the first campsite, you realise just how serious the practice of \"pack it in, pack it out\" is in the wilderness, applying to human waste and toothpaste spit as well as the more usual detritus of a camping trip. </p> <p>Camping is in two-person tents, with campsites invariably based on idyllic white-sand beaches beside the river, with a backdrop of pine forests and blue mountains. Meals, cooked by the guides, are also excellent and varied, there's plenty of beer and wine, and it doesn't take long to crash out to the sound of the nearby current. </p> <p>That said, if you take a hike from the camp-site up the canyon sides, there's every chance of seeing a big-horn sheep or deer, less so a bear (it pays to be \"bear aware\" if you're heading out into the back country). Ironically, it's perhaps on a lone hike before the evening meal that you're most likely to get a feel for the isolation and challenge that this landscape provided for the pioneers who stumbled through here less than 100 years ago. </p> <p>Away from the chatter and clatter of the camp-site, looking at the river flowing ceaselessly towards the far distant Pacific Ocean and the peaks and forests bearing down from above, it's not hard to imagine the awesome and sometimes frightening beauty that Idaho presented to those early travellers. Nor is it hard to understand why the native Sheepeater Indians, whose pictographs you may stumble across, revered and worshipped such an uncompromising and elemental landscape. </p> <p>Back on the river, it wasn't until day three of the trip that white-water started to become a regular thing, and I flipped out of my \"ducky\" (a single-person inflatable kayak) at the first sign of turbulence. But, as more and more Class III rapids assaulted us, I was surprised at how easy they were to deal with if you follow the river guide's advice. On day four, we hit our first Class III/IV rapids. One of them, Redside, is regarded as one of the 50 classic rapids in the US, so it was with no small measure of trepidation that I approached it alone in a duckie. </p> <p>All I could really see of it was a vague blur of white water and what followed was a good deal of bouncing around and a thorough soaking. Shooting a rapid of this size appears to boil down to a combination of anxiety and adrenalin, with, ideally, the adrenalin winning out and taking you through. It's only afterwards that you realise it was also fun. </p> <p>It's also a sobering thought that only 30 years ago this was still pioneer territory as far as kayakers and rafters were concerned, and even today only limited numbers are allowed on the Middle Fork each year during the June-September white-water season, so you're still very much in a part of the world that relatively few others have travelled through. </p> <p>The next day was different - shafts of hot sunlight beamed down from above the canyon walls to glimmer off the deep and fast flowing green waters, a noticeable change from the clear, shallow river upstream where you could see each rock beneath the surface and trout feeding on the bottom. Today's rapids would be nearly all Class III, some approaching IV, and at Devil's Tooth Rapids, I was unceremoniously flicked out of my ducky by a wave - more a solid wall of water, actually. But the swim was fun, my pride wasn't hurt, and I'd go back any time and do it again - as would every other member of our group. </p> <p>And if you bear in mind that this was anything but the Red Bull generation taking on one of America's best white-water challenges, it's pretty safe to say that rafting is a sport for anyone who doesn't mind getting wet. </p> <p><strong> Getting there</strong><br> </p> <p> The easiest way to reach the Middle Fork of the Salmon is from Boise, the capital of Idaho. Flights from the UK cost from \u00a3435 plus airport tax (North-South Travel, 01245 608291). From Boise, you can take an air taxi to the town of Stanley (from where you travel to the put-in point) then back from Salmon (the take-out point) for $195 (\u00a3135), or hire a car for the three-hour drive to Stanley. However, the car will then have to be shuttled to Salmon for you to pick up, which adds another $80 to the bill. </p> <p><strong> River guides</strong><br> </p> <p> River Odysseys West (ROW, PO Box 579, Couer d'Alene, Idaho 83816-0579, tel: 001 208 765 0841, e-mail info@ rowinc.com), based in Couer d'Alene, organises white- water rafting trips from mid-June to mid-September, and a six-day rafting trip, including food, camping gear and transport to and from the put-in point costs $1,445 -$1,525. </p> <p>Vessels provided include a sweep boat, which goes ahead each day with all the equipment to set up camp before your arrival; an oar boat, which sits high out of the water and allows you to relax while the guide controls the boat; a six-person paddle boat which requires you and fellow paddlers to do the work; and single-person inflatable kayaks, or duckies, which are easy to fall out of. You can take turns to ride in whichever of the three takes your fancy. </p> <p>You can run the river independently, but a permit is required and these are limited in number and awarded by lottery. </p> <p>For details on permits, contact Middle Fork Ranger District, PO Box 750 Chalis, Idaho 8326. </p> <p><strong> Where to stay</strong><br> </p> <p> ROW arranges accommodation for the night before and after the trip in Stanley and Salmon. However, if you want something a little different, try spending your first night at the Sawtooth Hotel, Ace of Diamonds Avenue, Stanley (you won't have trouble finding it as there are only about four unpaved streets in this classic western mountain town). </p> <p>Comfortable but basic rooms cost from $38 per night and staying here will have you feeling like an extra from High Plains Drifter. </p> <p><strong> Other activities</strong><br> </p> <p> The region really is an outdoor paradise and there's enough to keep even the most energetic going for a lifetime - hiking, biking, horse riding, fishing, hunting, lounging around in the area's many hot springs.Don't expect museums, galleries and trendy coffee houses though.

  "<p>Britain's millennium celebrations testified to a peculiar vision of nationhood. The national beacon, lit by the Queen to kindle a chain of flame from London to Aberdeen, was a gigantic crucible on which British Gas was scored in words 11 metres long beneath a crown of 18 BG logos. The Millennium Dome exhibits the work of some of our most cherished national institutions: the American companies Manpower and Ford. Its Body Zone was sponsored by Boots, its Mind Zone by the weapons manufacturer British Aerospace, and its Learning Zone by Tesco. </p> <p>Its Our Town stage, where \"the diversity of local culture is celebrated\", was financed by that guardian of diversity, McDonald's. British Airways and the British Airports Authority used the Journey Zone to explain to visitors the advantages of Heathrow Airport's proposed Terminal 5, in which they both have a certain interest. </p> <p>At the 1999 Labour party conference, Tony Blair told delegates he would \"set the people free\" by creating \"a model 21st-century nation, based... on the equal worth of all\". But some attendees at the conference were worth rather more than others. To reach the speeches, delegates had to fight their way past 62 corporate stalls: it looked more like a trade fair than a political gathering. </p> <p>The conference's fringe meeting on social justice in a global economy was sponsored by the Swiss company ABB, the builders of the turbines for the Three Gorges Dam in China, which displaced over a million people from the land. The meeting on holding government and companies to account was sponsored by the lottery company Camelot. The meeting on renewing democracy and rebuilding communities was financed by Tesco, widely blamed for shattering communities with their out-of-town superstores. When Lord Whitty, a minister at the department of the environment, was asked by the BBC whether the exhibitors at the conference were buying access to ministers, he replied: \"You don't buy access to ministers. You buy access to the whole party.\" I think he was trying to reassure us. </p> <p>These are the outward signs of the corporate takeover of Britain, crude and trivial manifestations of a deeper problem. Corporations, the contraptions we invented to serve us, are overthrowing us. They are seizing powers previously invested in government, and using them to distort public life to suit their own ends. </p> <p>The government shows few signs of concern about this coup d'etat. New Labour, its leaders often remind us, is the party of business, aiming to establish the most business-friendly environment in the world. There is, Blair told the Confederation of British Industry, \"great commitment and enthusiasm, right across the government, for forging links with the business community\". \"We want a society,\" the cabinet minister Peter Mandelson announced, \"that celebrates and values its business heroes as much as its pop stars and footballers.\" </p> <p>The struggle between people and corporations will be the defining battle of the 21st century. If the corporations win, liberal democracy will come to an end. The great social democratic institutions which have defended the weak against the strong - equality before the law, representative government, democratic accountability and the sovereignty of parliament - will be toppled. If the corporate attempt on public life is beaten back, then democracy may re-emerge the stronger for its conquest. But this victory cannot be brokered by our representatives. Democracy will survive only if the people in whose name they govern rescue the state from captivity. </p> <p>My story begins on the Isle of Skye, which became, under the Conservatives, the laboratory for a novel experiment. As the terms under which it is being conducted have come to light, it has developed into a scandal of the kind associated with Brazil, rather than Britain: the Labour government is now caught in this scandal. </p> <p>Skye lies over the sea. This topographical distinction delights the tourists following the flight of Bonnie Prince Charlie. But by the end of the 1980s, it was a nuisance to the residents. Car ferries connecting the island to the mainland kept breaking down, so that people often had to queue for two or three hours. Some residents called for a bridge. The strait, or kyle, that separated Skye from the mainland, they argued, was scarcely a mile wide at its narrowest point. English islands close to the mainland coast were served by roads; was it not time for Skye to be connected to the national network? </p> <p>The Scottish Office, a department of the Conservative government, agreed. Road building was, at the time, a central component of the government's economic programme. There was, it told the people of Skye, just one problem: it had no money. Public funds spent on building a bridge would be funds not spent on the island's health and education. Rather than be defeated by this, it had devised a new and remarkable solution. </p> <p>The people of Skye would get their bridge, but it would be financed by a private company. The company would build the structure at its own expense, then recoup the money by charging a toll. The Skye Bridge would be the first project built under something called the private finance initiative (PFI). This, started by the Conservatives and developed by Labour, has become the means by which many new roads, bridges, rail links, schools, hospitals and prisons in Britain are now built. </p> <p>In the week the bridge opened, in October 1995, the government-run ferry service stopped: the only efficient means of getting to Skye was the bridge. This might have been uncontroversial had the toll the private companies levied not been the highest, per metre of road, in the world. The one-mile crossing now costs \u00a35.70 each way. </p> <p>A legal discovery by veteran campaigner and folk singer Robbie the Pict convinced the people of Skye that the tolls were worth fighting. The toll regime, Robbie believed, breached Article 18 of the Act of Union, which forbids the Crown to levy a tax in Scotland in circumstances not encountered in England. As there was no sole road crossing to an inshore island which was tolled in England, and as the Scottish Office told the European Union that the tolls should be classified as a tax, the charges looked to Robbie like a violation of the act. </p> <p> Convinced that they had a constitutional as well as a moral case, the islanders began one of the biggest and most sustained campaigns of civil disobedience in Scotland since the Lewis Risings of 1919. It started with a petition, circulated by the West Highland Free Press. Though Skye has only 10,000 inhabitants, within a few weeks 7,000 people had signed up, demanding a free crossing rather than a toll bridge. They were ignored. So, when the bridge opened, many of the islanders refused to pay: 600 people - crofters, shopkeepers, doctors, factory workers and engineers, most of whom had never been in trouble before - were arrested. Some collected dozens of charges: Robbie was arraigned on 129. The Highlands police and judicial systems nearly collapsed beneath the load. The islanders launched legal counter-suits. </p> <p>The toll company changed its tactics. It stopped calling the police and refused to let the non-payers pass. So the islanders devised new means of frustrating their captors. Some days they would pay the toll penny by penny, blocking the bridge for hours. They would bring cardboard cheques so large that they wouldn't fit through the toll-booth window. They discovered that the collecting company banked its money on Friday, so 30 people agreed to arrive at intervals on a Saturday morning with \u00a3100 notes and no change. </p> <p>I met Robbie the Pict playing football around the toll booth on the bridge in the summer of 1998. He had discovered that Hamilton Park, the land on which the toll booth and the approach road were built, had been established with a deed that only a compulsory purchase order could repeal. In its hurry to get the bridge built, the Scottish Office had initiated compulsory purchase proceedings but forgot to complete them. Legally, the land remained a designated recreation area, and Robbie and friends were lawfully entitled to play football there, and use the barrier as a goal: \"They don't want to arrest us for this one as they don't want the issue raised in court. We could mount a legal challenge to the existence of the toll booths.\" </p> <p>The islanders discovered that the company empowered by the government to collect the tolls had changed its name, while the deed which appeared to allow it to charge the money remained the same. So Robbie bought the discarded company name - Skye Bridge Tolls Ltd - and insisted that he, and not the consortium, now had the legal right to collect the money. When the company protested, he offered to sell them the original name for \u00a31m, and demanded that they \"remove our good name\" from the documents they were using \"for the purpose of exacting money from road users\". \"I've got a right,\" he told me, \"to collect the tolls. One of these days I'm going to set up in a garden shed and if the police come I'll tell them, 'I've got the paperwork: it's them you should be arresting.'\" </p> <p>The protesters put in a bid to buy the bridge, and another to acquire the ferries that used to run across the kyle. Both were, unsurprisingly, rejected by the Scottish Office, which says that the bridge is owned by a consortium of three firms: two construction companies and the Bank of America. But the islanders later discovered that, by the time the bridge opened, the ownership had changed dramatically. One thousand shares had been issued. The Bank of America had 997 , while the remaining three were in the hands of Bank of America nominees. The bank was sole controller of the bridge. The other companies were employed merely to collect the tolls on its behalf and transfer the money to America. The Scottish Office had twice issued misleading statements about this. </p> <p>The Bank of America, previously known as the Bank of Italy, has a blemished record. In November 1998, it settled with 250 American government agencies which had sued it, after admitting that it had improperly shifted unclaimed payments into its own accounts instead of returning them to the public bodies to which they belonged. Most islanders' tolls are transferred to the bank headquarters in California. Skye had become, according to the protesters, part of a US banking gulag, a colonial penitentiary in which they were held to ransom. </p> <p>They chose Independence Day to demand release from their imperial masters. On July 4 1998, the Crofter's Kitchen cafe, on the Skye side of the bridge, was in uproar; 100 people crammed into it, singing, laughing and shouting. At the time advertised, the residents quietly filed into the car park. Robbie Cormack, a big man with a ginger moustache, brought out a clipboard. As he announced the names of the American states, protesters in fancy dress took placards: Florida went to a gigantic orange carton, with its ingredients listed as \"pure Florida orange, diluted with Scottish Office mandarins\". Mississippi went to a ghoul in a white hood and cape. </p> <p>Other protesters took banners reading \"Welcome to Skye, the \u00a35.60 state\" and \"Bank of America: The bank that likes to say gimme\". An accordionist struck up The Yellow Rose of Texas, and the Independence from America March set off past the sign the protesters had legally and perma nently installed on the roundabout (\"Beware: bogus toll collectors ahead\") and over the bridge to the mainland. </p> <p>The postmaster, Drew Millar, claiming to be Bill Clinton's special representative, apologised that the president couldn't be with them: he had, regrettably \"gotten held up in the bathroom, helping one of his interns to grasp the essentials of the body politic\". But, he went on, \"I would like to welcome you to the 51st state of America, and thank you sincerely for all the contributions you've made to our federal tax-take.\" </p> <p>There is a sheriff's court on the island, but the Crown insisted on trying protesters (378 islanders were prosecuted) in Dingwall, 120 miles away. Because of the caseload, and the etiolated nature of sheriff's court procedures, some defendants had to turn up in court as many as 15 times to defend a single case of the non-payment of \u00a35. \"They are trying to wear us down,\" Robbie the Pict told me, \"but they won't succeed.\" </p> <p> Another islander, John Campbell, who trained as an engineer, looked into the financing of the project. The bridge, according to the Miller Group, which built it, cost \u00a325m. The Scottish Office initially contributed \u00a313m. The European Investment Bank added \u00a313m. Private investors paid in \u00a37.5m, the contractors \u00a30.5m, and a commercial bank \u00a36m: a total of \u00a340m. The bridge was 60% overfinanced. </p> <p>The only explanation the islanders could suggest is that the investors believed the bridge would make a great deal of money, and they wanted to buy into a stake. The \u00a325m project will extract, for its private backers and the Bank of America, \u00a388m from one of the poorest places in the British Isles. </p> <p>So the people of Skye must pay a fee to an American bank every time they want to go to or from their island, although the costs of the bridge have already been met by the taxpayer and the European Investment Bank. The government had no need to use the PFI to build the bridge. As Skye lies within a regional development area, it could have asked the EU to provide nearly all the money for a toll-free crossing. The means of finance have nothing to do with saving public money. Far from Westminster and national newspapers, out of sight, out of mind, Skye was the ideal location for launching a corrupt, unpopular initiative, in which private companies were granted monopolistic control over public works. </p> <p>The people of Skye had every reason to believe that a Labour government would overturn the tolls. In 1995, Brian Wilson MP, who was to become the minister for industry in the Scottish Office and, later, a minister at the department for trade and industry, described the bridge as \"a shocking story of ideologues using a remote place for an experiment that they could not have got away with anywhere else\". The toll regime, he announced, was \"immoral, unacceptable and unjust\"; while the people of Skye were the \"near-monopoly prisoners of... ruthless commercial interests\". In 1996, he joined the demonstrators, marching over the bridge with a pipe band, and announced that the Tartan Toll Tax was \"an injustice which will not be meekly acquiesced in\". In the same year, Calum MacDonald MP, now a minister in the Scottish Office, asked his opposite number: \"Isn't it about time that he listened to the weight of public opinion... and scrap[ped] this toll regime?\" </p> <p>The local Labour candidate for the 1997 general election, Donnie Munro (formerly the lead singer of Runrig), told voters: \"The Labour party is committed to work in partnership to abolish the tolls within the shortest practicable timescale.\" The Scottish Labour party published a full-page ad to this effect in the West Highland Free Press a week before the election. </p> <p>Soon after the election was won, ministers announced that scrap ping the tolls would be impossible. It would, they maintained, cost \u00a330m to buy out the contract, which is more than the bridge cost to design and build. Brian Wilson told Scotland on Sunday: \"It's just a lie to say that either I or the Labour party promised to abolish the tolls.\" When the islanders requested that they be allowed to reopen the kyle ferry service and run it in competition with the bridge, Wilson told them it was a silly stunt. </p> <p>\"What hurts us most,\" John Campbell told me, \"is the sense of betrayal. These ministers were campaigners before they got into power. Now they're just suits.\" </p> <p>The Bank of America has continued to thrive in Britain. Before the election, the consortium to which it belonged won the contract to build the privately financed A30 dual carriageway in Devon. Since the election, it has become the lending bank for the \u00a31bn PFI contract to update and operate London Transport's ticketing services. </p> <p>In Skye, the court cases grind on. The islanders have now taken their appeals to the European Court of Human Rights and the European Court of Justice. But their demonstrations have diminished. Exhausted and impoverished, the people of Skye no longer have either the energy or the resources to sustain the pressure of the last few years. But they have not given up, and some say they never will. Because their battle is just the opening chapter of the corporate takeover of Britain. </p> <p>\u0095 This piece is an edited extract from The Captive State: The Corporate Takeover of Britain (Macmillan, \u00a312.99)</p>",
  "<p>World leaders will gather at this November's eco- summit at The Hague to discuss the next steps in haltimg climate change. But that's not soon enough for the eco-radicals here at Rise. As our small contribution to saving the planet, this week we sent two readers on a mission to Biosphere 2 in Tuscon, Arizona, one of the largest living laboratories in the world where they will help researchers conducting large-scale environmental experiments on Earth systems. And if you'd like to use your skills and knowledge to benefit the world, it could be your turn next year. </p> <p>Antonia Williamson and Ben Dixon are the two lucky Rise readers who have won a 16-week, all expenses-paid semester at Columbia University's Biosphere 2 Center campus near Tuscon in Arizona, courtesy of Volvo Car Corporation - a prize worth more than \u00a310,000 each. </p> <p>Biosphere 2 has been converted from a rather bizarre experiment to test the feasibility of humans living in a closed eco-system to a unique ecological laboratory and western branch campus of Columbia University, one of the so-called Ivy League schools in the United States. </p> <p>Biosphere means sphere of life. The term originated with Austrian geologist Eduard Suess in 1875 as a way to describe the envelope around the Earth where life exists. Biosphere 1 is the Earth. </p> <p>The 250-acre campus is set in the beautiful Sonoran desert, 30 miles north of Tucson, Arizona and around 200,000 visitors tour the site each year. The campus is a fascinating geological area sitting amidst three separate biomes, created by varying topography, temperatures and rainfall. It is also an archaeologically rich area with extensive Native American history. </p> <p>No other university has a research and education facility quite like the Biosphere 2. The building itself is an air-tight greenhouse covering three acres and 7m cubic feet of volume; it has a unique capacity for sensing and controlling the environment within. Sensors monitor the vital statistics such as temperature, light, humidity, carbon dioxide and other qualities of the air and soil. </p> <p>Researchers can control many of these variables by varying rainfall, temperature and even carbon dioxide levels to mimic different environmental conditions. For example, Biosphere 2 is the only laboratory in the world where a mature grove of cottonwood trees can be grown under controlled conditions permitting researchers to examine the effects of different levels of carbon dioxide on the growth of the trees. </p> <p>Today, carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere is the highest it has been in a million years, caused in part by burning coal, oil and natural gas. </p> <p>The Volvo Environmental Scholarships - open to any student graduating at a UK university - are the result of a partnership between Volvo and Columbia University aimed at better preparing students for future roles as decision makers in society. </p> <p>Degree discipline is irrelevant: Antonia is a fine art graduate from the University of Leeds while Ben has a zoology degree from Cambridge. Columbia University believes its multi-disciplinary curriculum is the best way of acquiring environmental knowledge because real world issues involve a wide range of fields including economics, culture, sociology, technology and law. </p> <p>Its inter-disciplinary courses are designed to help students understand global problems and to develop crucial leadership skills. Students are challenged to think critically and to solve the problems we face as a planet. </p> <p>Antonia and Ben have enrolled to the Earth Semester which runs until December 21. During that time they'll learn the fundamental science of earth and ecological systems, examining how science is used, not used or misued in human management of ecosystems. </p> <p>They'll be given a chance to apply lessons learned from the Biosphere 2 and regional case studies to the question of how people can better approach environmental problems on a global scale. They'll also complete a semester-long independent project. </p> <p>Volvo already runs successful environmental scholarships for American students at Biosphere 2, but the company is keen to make it an international scholarship - Antonia and Ben are the first outside the US to be admitted. </p> <p>\"Being a Volvo Environmental Scholar means becoming an ambassador for proactive environmental action,\" says John Pitts, Volvo's environmental manager. </p> <p>We'll keep you posted with Antonia and Ben's news from the Biosphere 2, but watch out for details of next year's scholarships when it could be your turn to help save the world.</p>",

Now it's time for Rise to add its tuppence worth. In a case of life imitating art imitating life, we asked two psychologists how graduates with contestants' character traits would fare in a typical office environment. </p> <p><strong> Nasty Nick - the manipulator:</strong> </p> <p>Cunning and clever, Nick used his charm - and his skill as a Reiki healer - to play his housemates off against each other. His scheming ways made him the most popular member of the Big Brother house until his dirty tricks were discovered. Feeling betrayed and humiliated, his housemates were happy to see him disqualified. </p> <p>\"There's a manipulator in every office,\" says Cary Cooper, professor of organisational psychology at UMIST. \"They're usually highly ambitious people with clear-cut objectives. A manipulator can be reasonably successful - if they have good social skills and they don't threaten or undermine anyone else. If, however, they put other people down or claim their ideas as their own, they can find themselves in trouble in the long term. Their victims will find a way to get back at them and they may find their career prospects adversely affected.\" </p> <p><strong> Promotion prospects: </strong>high </p> <p><strong>Dismissal prospects: </strong>very high. </p> <p><strong> Tyrone Tom - the quiet, shy one:</strong> </p> <p>Softly spoken and inoffensive, Tom was hardly visible for his first few weeks in the house. Mel helped to raise his profile by transferring her affections to him after Andrew's eviction. His brooding looks made him popular with the female audience, but he was never dynamic enough to have a hope of winning. </p> <p>Cary Cooper says quiet team members are perceived as being intelligent, good listeners who are unbiased and independent. Whether or not this is true, it can work in your favour: \"People won't presume they know your opinion, so they'll ask you for it. And you're also in a position to be a good mediator.\" </p> <p>The downside is that the introvert might be ignored. \"If you're an introvert and feel you're not making the impact you'd like, analyse why,\" suggests Colin Mercer, occupational psychologist and director of Pulse Graduate Recruitment. \"Perhaps you don't know your team-mates well enough, or you feel under-prepared. Then work on these factors. Ask your manager for help.\" </p> <p><strong> Promotion prospects: </strong>middling </p> <p><strong>Dismissal prospects: </strong>low. </p> <p><strong> Mel - the flirt:</strong> </p> <p>Mel has used her Spice Girl looks to manipulate the men. She's a tease - promising much, but never delivering. Her tactics have worked: until this week, she has never been up for eviction. But she's become a hate figure for the nation's women. </p> <p>According to Cary Cooper, there's nothing wrong with flirting, as long as it isn't perceived as sexual harassment and it isn't intended to undermine anyone. It may not, however, be the best strategy in the long-term. Colin Mercer says a flirt will only appeal to half their team, thereby ostracising the others: \"If you are flirtatious, manage it and keep it to a minimum. Be aware of the implications of your actions - self-insight is very important.\" If you're not a natural flirt, don't try it. </p> <p> <strong>Promotion prospects: </strong>high (particularly if your boss is the opposite sex) </p> <p><strong>Dismissal prospects:</strong> middling (it's a dangerous game) </p> <p><strong> Claire - the new girl:</strong> </p> <p>A replacement for Nick, Claire bounced in to the house half-way through the show, with little hope of lasting the distance. Friendly and keen, she made a natural ally of Craig, but the others (particularly Mel) resented the newcomer and she was ejected at the first opportunity. Joining a long-established team is difficult both for the rookie and the team. \"All groups establish individual roles,\" explains Cary Cooper. \"When a newcomer joins the team everybody else has a clearly defined role, but the new person has yet to establish theirs. This may create problems and conflict - particularly if the newcomer threatens someone else's role. Ultimately, the group figures out who's good at doing what and what the group needs.\" </p> <p><strong> Promotional prospects:</strong> low (you'll have a long time to wait) </p> <p>Dismissal prospects: high (you've got to get through your probation period) </p> <p><strong> Scouse Craig - the joker:</strong> </p> <p>Now favourite to win the \u00a370,000 prize, cheeky chappie Craig soared in the nation's estimations when he dealt with Nick's betrayal sensitively and diplomatically. Fond of a practical joke, Craig knows how to defuse tension. </p> <p>\"A joker can make a huge, positive contribution to the team,\" says Colin Mercer. \"Enthusiasm is infectious, it builds energy and drives a real force for action in the group. The joker makes work more enjoyable and takes the heat out of tense situations.\" </p> <p>There is, however, a time and a place for humour. Get it wrong and you'll end up looking like a fool, with your reputation in tatters. \"Work out if your joking is indiscriminate or for a purpose,\" says Cary Cooper. </p> <p> <strong>Promotion prospects: </strong>high (unless you go too far) </p> <p><strong>Dismissal prospects: </strong> low (unless you go too far)</p>",
  "<p><strong> Life in the Jungle: My Autobiography</strong><br> Michael Heseltine<br> 304pp, Hodder &amp; Stoughton, \u00a320 <br> </p> <p> Writing memoirs is one activity in which the Labour record has been consistently better than that of the Tories. The Benn, Crossman and Castle diaries, like the Jenkins and Healey autobiographies, testify to a category difference. Those on the British left have had more interest in observing themselves in action, and then setting down the record with revelatory candour, than any post-war Conservative has shown. Nigel Lawson is their closest rival, and parts of Thatcher, Howe and Prior edge towards recklessness. But the average Conservative mind doesn't like such work. Long-discarded volumes labelled Tebbit and Fowler, Whitelaw and Carrington are as useless to historians as they proved indigestible to the modest handful of readers who opened them. </p> <p>Michael Heseltine's autobiography has been awaited with more optimism. Here is a very big politician, never far from controversy. No shrinking violet Hezza. He was at the front line for a long time, often courting risk, famously independent, the witness to many dramas, a man who every year at the party conference grandly shook his hair at far horizons. Now an elder statesman, ambition frustrated but perforce sated, he is positioned to tell a riveting story of his life and times. </p> <p>The early days set the scene for a recognisable figure. Born in Swansea of modest entrepreneurial stock, he had a happy childhood, and he recreates its pleasures well. Even at Shrewsbury, which he didn't enjoy, he was into business, buying fizzy drinks cheap and selling them expensive. Rejected by Reading and Bristol Universities for academic inadequacy, he got into Oxford on the strength of an interview with the college Master. There, he revived the finances of the Union by starting a nightclub in the basement, and then got the Dockers, louche fast-money socialites of their day, to pay for it. </p> <p>The lineaments of the buccaneering shaker thus begin to emerge. He was always concerned about his hair, getting his personal barber to shave it off before National Service rather than risk an army scalping. He bought a Jag before he was 25, and dined for years before that at the Connaught. This was on the strength of early successes in the property business, which had its downs as well as ups, and which Heseltine describes with some thoroughness. He has been at least as successful at business as politics, which is very rare. Though he reports that he still, as a semi-dyslexic, doesn't like reading, he writes a serviceable prose - sometimes, especially when he gets to Westland, with considerable narrative power. </p> <p>Yet when we reach his central, public life, the book begins to depart from the character we might have thought we understood. Although it is a long book, it's a disappointingly small one. The horizons remain unaddressed: many large events he saw and took part in do not feature here. A man who seemed to be a quintessential exponent of high politics has written a memoir that, to a large extent, eschews them. </p> <p>The great figures who surrounded him escape, for the most part, considered evaluation. The Mail serialisation made out that this was a violent attack on Margaret Thatcher, but the slivers it put together to satisfy its appetite must have come from widely scattered paragraphs. Though Heseltine makes plain his disagreements, there's no set-piece attack, just as there are few piercing judgments on other colleagues. Only Norman Lamont comes in for a truly cutting verdict on his various duplicities. John Major, Kenneth Clarke, Douglas Hurd are treated amicably, and not untruthfully, but without the judgmental distance one might have looked for. </p> <p>This accords with Heseltine's habit as a politician. Like Tony Benn, he seldom talked personalities. But now he is an author, recording his days for the instruction of an audience, and his self-denial reaches into the more serious field of major policy. What Hezza did not do himself, it seems, he decided not to write about at all. Perhaps such punctilio should be admirable: only record what you know at first hand. Actually, it leaves gaping holes that he could very well have filled, had he possessed the chronicler's fascination of a Denis Healey. </p> <p>The story he does tell often falls into the worthy but mundane: valuable to later historians but less gripping to contemporary readers aware of what they're missing. Heseltine was a very serious minister, who spent long years in two bursts getting to close grips with urban renewal and the built environment. He writes with convincing passion, in great detail, about what he did in Liverpool. We watch his theories and policies about the infrastructure of Britain, dating from his first jobs in the Heath government, coming to fruition with remarkable frequency over 30 years. </p> <p>He was also a resolute Whitehall manager, who retained an enthusiasm for the minutiae of such work wherever we went, and not least in the Ministry of Defence. Spicing the story, we get a fuller picture, also, of how flak-jacketed Tarzan triumphed over CND. But the saga ends with our man back in Whitehall, Major's deputy prime minister in charge of management-chasing, still undiminished in his fascination with administrative machinery, and reversing an earlier conviction that departmental ministers should be left alone by the centre. </p> <p>But in all these years the cabinet goes virtually unreported. Not a single cabinet meeting is described, and no kind of justice is done to the colossal rows, which Heseltine intimately witnessed, about monetarism and its consequences in the early Thatcher years. The defining argument between Lawson and Thatcher about economic management in the mid-1980s might as well not have happened, for all the attention it gets here. The European battles that ripped the Tories apart echo but dimly in the distance. Even the departure from the exchange-rate mechanism in 1992, when he was back in the thick of things, is most cursorily treated. He was not, you see, in charge. And as a memoirist - the difference between Tory and Labour - he suffers fatally for sticking to rules of secrecy that are long outdated. </p> <p>The prize of the piece, however, is a good one. The story of the Westland scandal, which precipitated Heseltine's departure from the cabinet in 1986, has not been more authoritatively told. One is reminded, with some extra juicy bits, of the unconscionable behaviour of Mrs Thatcher and her entourage, which none of their memoirs has satisfactorily explained. Nor has the old man lost his venom here. He includes an email address where he can be contacted, by anyone with light to throw on the post-Westland share-rigging concert-party which, he still seems to be convinced, involved shadowy Thatcherites and others. </p> <p>His book, earnestly done and thorough as far as it goes, recounts the life of a man with important convictions, and a commitment to public life that folded ambition into service in admirable proportions. It offers mini-glimpses that startle and reveal. Heseltine wanted Chris Patten, instead of going to Hong Kong, to be the first recipient of a constitutional innovation, and take a one-term life peerage prior to fighting the next election. He says that when he failed to beat Major for the leadership, he was \"in tears\". He reveals that the Dome could have been an even worse catastrophe: there was a time when Hyde Park was thought to be the place for it. </p> <p>But ultimately the book exposes a narrower man than the big politician who wrote it. Or perhaps not. Maybe, in the end, the minister as manager, as armchair quarter-master, as urban renewer, as competitiveness addict at the DTI, as tunnel-vision European, is what Michael Heseltine was. Not the supreme leader deprived of his just deserts, but perhaps a man without the spaciousness for the highest of high politics.</p>"
