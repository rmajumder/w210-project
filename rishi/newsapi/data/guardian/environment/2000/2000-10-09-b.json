  "<p>The UK is at the forefront of a global boom in mergers and acquisitions (the takeover of one company by another), investing abroad last year more than any other country. Mega deals, such as Vodafone's takeover of AirTouch and BP's of Amoco, resulted in foreign investment from the UK worth almost $200bn in 1999, leapfrogging America as the biggest outward investor for the first time since 1988. The chart shows UK in and outflows compared with France, traditionally also a big investor. </p> <p>For the chief executives of acquiring companies and their advisers, such deals bring golf-club bragging rights and enormous financial rewards, yet results for their shareholders are often disappointing. Studies keep showing that most mergers fail. The shares of the company being acquired often rise in value but those of the predator fall. A KPMG study last year showed that 53% of mergers destroyed shareholder value. Mark Sirower, a professor at New York University and adviser to Boston Consulting Group, puts the failure rate at about 65%. </p> <p>Given the portents, it would not be unreasonable to expect bosses everywhere to give up on acquiring new firms and concentrate on organic growth. Instead, the pace of mergers is accelerating, not just within countries but between them too. Figures collected by the UN conference on trade and development (Unctad) show cross-border mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As) drove foreign investment volumes to a new record of $856bn last year. It reckons the total may well pass $1,000bn this year. </p> <p>Most deals are conducted between firms in the developed world. Companies based in the EU were the most acquisitive, with the UK accounting for 39% of total EU outflows. The boom in Europe is being driven in part by the arrival of the euro, which contributes to greater price transparency and increased competition, putting more pressure on firms to restructure and consolidate their operations. </p> <p>It is also a facet of globalisation and the desire of companies to become top dog, not just in their native country or region but the world. In the same way that a global marketplace for goods and services is emerging, so too is one for firms. The process is aided by information technology which makes distant business units easier to manage; changes in financial markets, which allow deals to be financed through share swaps rather than cash; and deregulation. </p> <p>The market expects corporate leaders to deliver double digit growth every year. The only way to do that, especially in mature industries, is to buy other companies, thereby gaining instant access to new production and strategic assets. Yet, by buying other companies, bosses put their own company at risk of failure. However, trying to grow the business organically is not an option either because of the danger of being left behind by competitors if one of their takeover deals defies the odds and succeeds. </p> <p>Part of the motive for doing such deals is that it allows chief executives to boast. Yet mistakes made in the thrill of the chase can be very costly to the individuals concerned. The collapse of the planned merger between the two Ger man banks Deutsche and Dresdner earlier this year tarnished the reputations of both. Deutsche Bank's management was exposed as divided and confused. Dresdner lost Bernhard Walter, its chairman, who resigned. Senior members of Dresdner Kleinwort Benson, its investment banking unit, walked out. </p> <p>If collateral damage were limited to a few high-profile resignations, the M&amp;A boom would not be a cause for concern. But the ramifications are often felt across a much broader horizon than the individual and the company. </p> <p>In the developing world, foreign direct investment is dominated by so-called greenfield investment, that is the establishment of new foreign affiliates. But cross- border M&amp;A activity is on the rise there too, accounting for a third of foreign investment in 1999. Greenfield investment is regarded as a good thing for generating new jobs and providing a more stable source of foreign capital than hot money flows into shares or other financial investments. But the impact of M&amp;A on development is double edged and uneven, says Unctad. Rather than adding to productive assets in a country, M&amp;As simply transfer ownership of existing ones. In the case of a firm which would otherwise go bankrupt, the arrival of a new foreign owner is obviously beneficial. But often transfer of ownership can lead to job losses, not gains, as the acquiring company reorganises production in line with its corporate strategy rather than to the benefit of the host country. </p> <p>Foreign investment carried by M&amp;As can also threaten competition. Acquiring companies may get a stranglehold on an industry, restricting choice and keeping prices high. Developing countries rarely have effective competition policies to counter such threats. </p> <p>Unctad draws parallels between the emergence of a national market in the US at the end of the 19th century and a global one today. Then, a massive M&amp;A boom and resulting concerns about competition prompted the federal government to develop anti-trust legislation (today the US has one of the most effective competition regimes in the developed world). Now that the world economy is experiencing a similar transformation, a global response is required to safeguard consumer interests. </p> <p> Mark Atkinson is the Guardian's economics correspondent </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:mark.atkinson@theguardian.com\">mark.atkinson@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>It carries some of the most striking visual images of any magazine in the world, it was founded by an Estonian who has worked for the Australian defence department, it is based on the Pacific coast of Canada and perhaps no publication could claim to be more in tune with the current international campaign against corporatism and globalisation. </p> <p>It is Adbusters, the \"journal of the mental environment\", and from its exquisitely executed covers to the call for cultural revolution at the end of the magazine it is now, in the wake of Prague and Seattle, attracting admirers and readers from all sides of the political arena. Next month it will be encouraging the world to take part in a Buy Nothing Day and this month it is running a \"creative resistance contest\" to encourage worldwide cultural rebellion. Its ideas come from the French Situationists and from Marshal McLuhan but its concepts and execution are very much twenty-first century. </p> <p>The manifesto at the back of the bi-monthly explains who is behind the publication: \"We are a loose global network of artists, writers, environmentalists, ecological econo mists, media-literacy teachers, reborn lefties, ecofeminists, downshifters, high-school shit-disturbers, campus rabble-rousers, incorrigibles, malcontents and green entrepreneurs . . . We believe that culture jamming will become to our era what civil rights was to the 60s, feminism to the 70s, and environmental activism to the 80s . . . Above all, it will change the way we interact with the mass media and the way in which meaning is produced in our society.\" </p> <p>Adbusters was actually born more than 10 years ago, but it is only since the events of Seattle last year which led up to the demonstrations in Prague this year that it has suddenly started to break through to a much wider audience. Articles in its latest edition cover everything from the marketing of the American elections to a story about McDonald's in Lebanon, from a polemic on anarchism to news of what \"culture jammers\" have been up to in Japan. </p> <p>Its founder and editor-in-chief is 58-year-old Kalle Lasn, who left Estonia as a two-year-old, and grew up in Australia where he worked for the defence department before moving first to Tokyo where he was in market research and then to Canada. There he became an award- winning documentary film-maker before founding Adbusters, which was driven by his increasing disillusionment with the corporatisation of the world and the failure of conventional left politics to combat it. His philosophy is contained in the book Culture Jam, the Uncooling of America, where the list of dedications includes \"My mortal enemy, Philip Morris Inc which I vow to take down.\" </p> <p>Lasn believes that the mass media now dispense a form of the \"soma\" that Aldous Huxley predicted in Brave New World: \"The most powerful narcotic in the world is the promise of belonging. And belonging is best achieved by conforming to the prescriptions of America.\" In response, Lasn and his colleagues have set themselves the task of \"unswooshing America\" and \"jamming its image factory until it comes to a sudden, shuddering halt\". Adbusters is effectively the bulletin of that movement. </p> <p>Lasn estimates that we receive around 3,000 marketing messages in an average day, from the logos on people's clothes to the billboards or posters we pass, to the commercials on our televisions and the ads in our daily papers or the signs in our super markets; some research puts the figure even higher. Adbusters' aim is to start to reverse the process. </p> <p>\"At the beginning, I did feel we were talking to the converted,\" says Lasn, \"but all of a sudden there is a well-spring of interest.\" Initially, Adbusters was produced on newsprint and had only a small if loyal following, but it now sells 100,000 copies worldwide, mainly in the US, but also throughout Australia and New Zealand and with around 2,000 subscribers in the UK. Its small team of journalists, based in Vancouver, are mainly in their 20s and 30s. </p> <p>Lasn attributes the recent attention to the whole post-Seattle effect and certainly many of the ideas which come into the magazine and its website have the subversive message of the loose movement that has emerged since then and been seen on the streets of Washington, Philadelpia, Los Angeles and Prague. He sees the growth of a global anxiety that the magazine taps into. \"There is a messy feeling that things aren't quite right.\" Essentially he sees the magazine as a player in the epic battle between corporate culture and civic culture - \"a people-driven planet earth or a corporate-driven planet inc\". </p> <p>And for all the playful nature of the publication, Lasn and his colleagues are quite serious. As he put it in Culture Jam: \"Instead of treating vegetative, corporate-driven TV culture as something to be gently, ironically mocked, it's time to face the whole ugly spectre of our TV-addicted nation, the savage anomie of a society entranced and entrapped and living a lie. It's time to admit that chronic TV watching is North America's number-one mental health problem and that a society in which citizens spend a quarter of their waking lives (more than four hours a day) in front of their sets is in serious need of shock therapy.\" </p> <p>If you watch people flipping through Adbusters in a bookstore or newsagents, you can often sense the slight puzzlement on their faces. Is this ad for Absolut Vodka for real? Is this two-page photo-spread of an elderly man asking \"How can I die with dignity?\" an invitation to a website about dying? </p> <p>This is part of the magazine's intent, a desire to challenge the persuasion industry, to subvert the meaning in the message and to encourage people to become \"culture jammers\", taking on the corporations at their own game. \"Corporations advertise and culture jammers subvertise\", is one of their credos. Adbusters does take ads itself and will run \"advocacy advertisements\", such as either pro- or anti-abortion, but it reserves the right to vet every other kind of ad which means that most that do appear are mainly for books and CDs, rather than for, say, cars and alcohol. </p> <p>Some of the visuals are subversions of well-known ads but although all the likely suspects - Nike, McDonald's, Coca-Cola and Walt Disney - have been lampooned, only one has sued: \"Absolut Vodka came after us with a horde of lawyers, but we beat them back quite handsomely. They got scared and ran away with their tail between their legs. We have quite consciously provoked people like Nike and McDonald's - they haven't sued but they do subscribe.\" Lasn ran into problems, however, when he tried to advertise his Buy Nothing Day on television. All the major networks refused to run the commercials and CNN only agreed after being hounded by a reporter from the Wall Street Journal. </p> <p>But Adbusters remains optimistic. If not culture jam today, then certainly culture jam tomorrow.</p>",
  "<p>Don't get me wrong, I loathe being on the bandwagon, and cherish the contrary opinion as much as any Englishman. So had I been asked \"Is there anything new in the new economy?\" nine months ago, when the New Economy was being tipped to banish the Old Economy from this earth, I would have taken the opposite view from the one I am about to put forward. But that was then. Today, with stock-market valuations crashing, and the New Economy seemingly in flight, it is more important to make the opposite case. Here it is. </p> <p>A new economy is emerging that will fundamentally change the nature and structure of global business. It is based on a series of innovations built one on top of the other over the past decade or so, and now reaching a tipping point - a point of inflection beyond which change accelerates irreversibly to a new order. </p> <p>Over the past decade, information technology has been increasingly used to allow customers and suppliers to work together to create more timely delivery of more custom-tailored offerings. The business processes have not changed, but while IT was previously largely confined to enhancing processes within a single corporation, it is now also being used to enhance inter-company processes. This effort began with client server systems, but was impeded by a host of technical difficulties. However, widespread use of the internet as an inter-company platform has effectively eliminated the bulk of these problems. We have already seen this in the hi-tech sector, telecommunications and financial services - the bellwethers of the new economies. </p> <p>The most important difference in these new economies is that they favour virtual integration over vertical integration. That is, they favour assembling a customer offering from best-of-breed components integrated across companies, as opposed to the same offering delivered as an end-to-end solution from one company. This preference is not universal, but in sectors of the economy where massive changes are under way, the cost of a single company keeping up with all the technologies to supply all the components has become prohibitive, in terms of cost and time to market. Moreover, because of the advances in inter-company IT systems, it is feasible to pull together multiple vendors into a single, coordinated supply chain that delivers a complex product on time and within specifications. Under those conditions, the added value of best-of-breed component elements overshadows the integration value of a single provider. </p> <p>Wherever virtual integration can supplant vertical integration, it will win the accolades of the capital markets. Investors want their money to go into activities that increase the company's differentiation, its competitive advantage, its raison d' tre for charging a premium for its offerings. That's what creates great returns and raises share price. To the degree that these offerings are diluted with components that are not core to the company, investors see their money going into something that will not create privileged returns and thus not impact on share price. So the best-of-breed providers leveraging the new IT get higher market valuations, giving them a lower cost of capital, as well as turning their shares into an acquisition currency. To be sure, the high-flying internet shares have shown that this idea can be abused, but companies such as Dell, Cisco, Microsoft and Intel - all of which supply components, not end-to-end solutions - have shown that the best-of-breed position can be very powerful. </p> <p>The rewards the capital markets have lavished on such companies in the hi-tech sector has given rise to an industry structure made up of networks of inter-operating companies. Ideally, each company in the network contributes that element of the end solution that is core to its mission and talents and leaves everything non-core to some other company, for whom that same element is core. In this way, every company is earning the maximum returns for its shareholders by focusing its scarce resources on the activities that generate the most competitive advantage for it. </p> <p>Finally, this networked economy has made itself even more dependent on IT systems to coordinate with customers and suppliers to create more timely delivery of more tailored offerings - so we are back where we started, initiating another cycle through this loop, recruiting more companies, expanding into adjacent sectors, reinforcing existing advantages, and creating new ones. </p> <p>This cycle is well under way in certain sectors of the US economy, with strong prospects for going global and for gaining expansion into other sectors. Rapid widespread adoption of the internet will accelerate these changes. This will undermine the traditional, vertically integrated Fortune 500 corporation, and give rise to more granular, networked economic entities. We are leaving behind a world dominated by Tyrannosaurus Rex for a new one ruled by velociraptors. The flesh-eaters will still create the havoc, but they will come in a new package.</p>",
  "<p>Vivendi has insisted its merger with Seagram is on track, despite reports of a management fall-out between the French media group and its sister company, Canal Plus. </p> <p>Sources at Vivendi rubbished rumours that Vivendi chairman Jean-Marie Messier came close to firing Canal Plus counterpart Pierre Lescure last week. The pair were said to be at loggerheads over plans to integrate Canal Plus, a pay-TV channel, with proposed merger partner Seagram, the owner of Universal Studios.</p> <p>\"Messier and Lescure recently held two meetings over integration plans and have been working together to prepare analysts' meetings for next week,\" said the source. The source added that the company did not know where the rumours were coming from, but suspected that it may be someone unhappy with being left out in the cold by the integration plans. </p> <p>The Seagram merger is being examined by EU regulators, who are set to reach a decision on the \u00a323bn deal before October 13.

  "<p>Sportsworld Media is enjoying the never-ending boom in sports broadcasting. It has interests in sports TV production, sponsorship and events marketing and this year boosted its size through a series of acquisitions.</p> <p>Chief executive Geoff Brown spoke to MediaGuardian on the day Sportsworld announced preliminary pre-tax profits for the year of \u00a32.7m, against \u00a31.3m last year. Turnover soared by \u00a315m to \u00a320.7m, on the back of some canny acquisitions in the Asia Pacific.</p> <p>MediaGuardian's <strong>Dan Milmo</strong>: \"What were the key factors behind today's results?\"</p> <p><strong>Mr Brown</strong>: \"It's down to a combination of strong organic growth and acquisitions. Our purchases have bedded down more quickly than we expected. Australia Media Holdings and Sports &amp; Outdoor Media International have performed well. We have integrated them quickly and they have settled into the group.\"</p> <p><strong>DM</strong>: \"Given that the acquisitions have done so well for the company so far, do you plan more next year?\"</p> <p><strong>GB</strong>: \"It's an extremely fragmented market, and a big one. There are a lot of acquisitions that have come to us, and we are reviewing them now. We have identified the right criteria for a good purchase. We expect to be making more acquisitions during the course of the year, as we are so good at knitting in these companies and bedding them down.\"</p> <p><strong>DM</strong>: \"With turnover up nearly 75%, are you not setting yourself impossible targets for next year's results?\"</p> <p><strong>GB</strong>: \"We clearly don't want to overstate ourselves, but analysts have projected our earnings for the next year, and we are very comfortable with them.\"</p> <p><strong>DM</strong>: \"How well-placed are you in the sports broadcast market?\"</p> <p><strong>GB</strong>: \"There is a very significant shift in the marketing and spending of advertisers, which are moving into sports events sponsorship.

We provide the solution to their sponsorship needs.\" </p> <p><strong>DM</strong>: \"What about TV production?\"</p> <p><strong>GB</strong>: \"Our business is now strong in terrestrial, cable and satellite, and we have programming that will satisfy any viewer in any environment.

  "<p>The debate raging over fuel prices in Europe is a signal that something has to be done about transport. </p> <p>The answer is within our grasp. It is time to put prices on roads - to bring in \"congestion charging\" all over Britain and not just in London. We have the electronic technology to do so and, in reducing the traffic jams that plague our lives, the country would benefit enormously. </p> <p>Road tolls would make our roads flow again. That would be good for firms' profitability, for people's marriages and stress levels, for the environment and especially for our grandchildren's well-being. </p> <p>The money raised could be spent in useful ways, such as reducing other taxes - including those on fuel - and improving public services and infrastructure. Our present fuel tax is a blunt instrument: it penalises those on empty lanes as much as those on the M25, and it does little to change the amount of traffic. </p> <p>Building roads is not the answer. In the past 20 years car traffic has doubled. The rise shows no sign of flattening. Yet Britain still has far fewer cars per head than the US. Something has to be done if the next generation of Britons is not to be overwhelmed by jams, smog and concrete. </p> <p>Although we pay petrol and road fund taxes, we are free to use any particular British road. Imagine what would happen if supermarkets gave away their products for free or nearly free. There would be queues outside every store. People would have to get up early and allocate periods in their diaries just to buy food. </p> <p>It would be no use building wider front doors to these supermarkets (the let's build more roads approach), or having special paths into supermarkets that only certain people could use (the bus lane approach). As soon as the queue started to shorten, other consumers would notice and come to the new wide-entrance supermarkets. </p> <p>The supermarkets would be better advised to put prices on their goods. That is what they do - and it works. Britain's roads could be like this. They could flow without queues. </p> <p>Every economist knows that a queue forms when a demand and supply mechanism fails. Using the price system to ration things is the most sensible way. This is what we do for steel ingots, newspapers, cream teas and everything else. It is especially necessary on roads because drivers do not bear in mind when they make a journey that their presence on the road creates an \"externality\" for others. </p> <p>Traffic congestion especially distorts the lives of our most highly skilled workers. Commuting time for Britons with university degrees is one and a half times as long as for others. In south-east England, a quarter of all those with university degrees spend more than two hours a day travelling to and from work. </p> <p>The British simply shrug their shoulders and accept that it is impossible to drive to Heathrow airport at 8.30 am; we design our lives around traffic jams. We should not. Road pricing would make our roads run freely again - and that would be good for the efficiency of the economy. </p> <p>There are objections to road pricing. The most common is that road tolls would raise firms' costs. It would not. Road pricing would make life cheaper for firms in Britain. Tolls would be set at the right level to make traffic flow freely - and no higher. </p> <p>A road toll of \u00a35, say, would be negligible for a lorry carrying \u00a3100,000 of goods. But it would be a lot of money to a person going to the shops for a newspaper or heading off to a leisure centre for squash before work or a parent taking a child to school because it is raining. The toll would take such users off the road and out of the lorry's way. </p> <p>A lorry journey time that is cut by 10 minutes would easily be worth the toll. Thus road pricing would cut companies' costs and make the economy work more efficiently. </p> <p>It would be a simple matter for a government to set tolls on lorries at a different level from those on cars. </p> <p>Why then do some road users say they are against congestion charging? It is because people do not realise, when answering opinion polls, that road tolls would clear the roads. After an experimental week of road tolls, Britain would never wish to go back to the jams of toll-free roads. </p> <p>Another criticism is that road pricing would hurt the poor. It would not. </p> <p>Sensible road tolls would be designed to be high at peak times. Those on high wages would travel then and pay for the privilege. People on low incomes could choose to travel at other times of the day when the tolls were low or even zero. </p> <p>Most people in the lowest fifth of income distribution in Britain do not own a car. They would be unaffected by road charges. </p> <p>Several methods of tackling road congestion are possible: </p> <p>electronic road pricing (ERP) schemes, cordon tolls or toll booths; </p> <p>restricted access at certain times or on certain days to different coloured/numbered cars - as in Athens and Mexico City; </p> <p>metered parking in residential areas near central business districts; </p> <p>closing roads to cars at certain busier times (Oxford); </p> <p>and toll bridges (the two Severn bridges). </p> <p>Schemes that involve directly banning drivers infringe personal freedom and are less desirable than road pricing. </p> <p>The best method would be ERP, where variable tariffs reflect the marginal external costs of a trip. </p> <p>In Spain, France, Italy, Japan and some US states, the toll revenue is used to finance new motorways. Other ERP systems have been installed in Barcelona, Lisbon, Dallas, Oklahoma and Florida. </p> <p>Oslo has had a system in place since 1990 using electronic tags and beacons around the central business district. Singapore is testing a newer system and Stockholm is beginning a similar scheme for its ring road. </p> <p>\u0095 Andrew Oswald is professor of economics at Warwick University</p>",
  "The slow and toxic death of the Taj Mahal has been evident for some time. India's most celebrated monument, with its sweeping views over the Yamuna River, is these days more off-white than white. If the tens of thousands of visitors who pour into the mausoleum every day were not enough, there are 1,700 factories in the Agra area, which ensure that pollution levels are kept nicely topped up. <p>Revisiting the Taj over the weekend, for the first time in 13 years, the full horrific scale of the problem became apparent. Were Shah Jahan to turn up now, three and a half centuries after the grandiloquent monument to his late queen was completed, he would be in for a bit of a shock. Jahan, who ended his days imprisoned in Agra's Red Fort, might conclude the Taj had lost some of its transcendent purity.</p> <p>The main problem is, of course, the traffic. To arrive in Agra by car is to be plunged immediately into the mother of all jams. Being in India, the jam does not just consist of cars, but of rickshaws, mopeds, camels, horse-drawn tongas, bicycles, irate traffic policemen and - on the outskirts of town - performing bears. Merely to get to the Taj car park is something of an achievement.</p> <p>But there are other factors too which explain the Taj's lingering decline: principally, that the building has become a victim of its own global celebrity. Shortly before 4pm, when the admission charge rises from 30p to \u00a31.50, thousands of mainly domestic Indian tourists descend to get in under the wire. On Fridays, when the monument is free, complete bedlam breaks out.</p> <p>The problem of pollution is currently made worse by the fact that India is in the grip of the festival season. For Muslims, it is Urs, when pilgrims traditionally visit a succession of Moghul and Sufi sites, arriving in coaches laden with purple plastic tricycles. For Hindus, it is almost Diwali - the Hindu equivalent of Christmas - when firecrackers are let off, sending even more fumes into the sky.</p> <p>It is not, it has to be said, just the Taj which is suffering from neglect. Across the Indian subcontinent, monuments are collapsing at an alarming rate through a mixture of official apathy and a broader cultural indifference. There is, it could be argued, little incentive to maintain much of the country's fragile heritage. The invading races who constructed much it in the first place - the Moghuls in north India; the Portuguese, with their flamboyant cathedrals in Goa; and the medieval-loving British - have all long departed.</p> <p>While Gandhi's shrine is still lovingly tended, as is only correct, places where the colonial British buried their dead have fared less well. During a recent walk in old Delhi I stumbled across a well-hidden mid-Victorian graveyard on Lothian Road. Indian Christian squatters have occupied the cemetery. But they had done little to arrest its decline. The funerary angels have been decapitated; the obelisk pillars toppled over; and the inscriptions on the gravestones obliterated.</p> <p>The living moving into the gaps left by the dead has accelerated the process of decay. Opposite my flat in Delhi, entire families live in the wall of Humayan's tomb that, like the Taj, is another fine Moghul mausoleum. Blue minarets in the neighbourhood are draped with washing. Even in the more prestigious monuments, graffiti reaches to the ceiling. Unless India reacquaints itself soon with its own brilliant architecture, much of its great past will be erased.</p>",
  "This time she really is going. France's employment and social affairs minister, Martine Aubry, famous daughter of a famous father (remember Jacques Delors?) and the star of Prime Minister Lionel Jospin's Socialist-led cabinet, will pack her bags after next week's meeting of European jobs ministers. <p>Few would dispute her record: unemployment is down below 10% for the first time since 1991; her pet project, the 35-hour week, is in force in larger companies; a major job creation scheme for young people is in place; free healthcare for the poorest in French society is a reality; the welfare budget is on its way to being balanced. </p> <p>Ms Aubry, 50, has been the prime mover behind all the flagship social and employment legislation on which the Jospin government was elected. She leaves behind just one piece of particularly tricky unfinished business, the reform of France's unemployment insurance, Unedic, which is run jointly by employers and unions. </p> <p>Inexplicably to Anglo-Saxon minds, she is leaving government to concentrate on her campaign for next year's local elections in the newly flourishing northern city of Lille, where she has been assiduously building her power base under the wing of a former Socialist prime minister, Pierre Mauroy, who retires as mayor in 2001. </p> <p>Local politics continue to exercise a remarkable appeal in France. More than 90% of deputies in the present government hold local government posts and more than half are mayors. As the French are fond of saying, governments in Paris come and go, but provincial politics are for life. </p> <p>Running a large town in the provinces is considered just as prestigious - and as influential - a job as heading up a mere ministry, and until now has been no barrier to holding national office. </p> <p>Prime ministers such as Mr Mauroy, Alain Jupp\u00e9 and Raymond Barre have combined the top job with presiding over the town councils of Lille, Bordeaux and Lyons; Jacques Chirac was leader of his RPR party, prime minister and mayor of Paris all at the same time. </p> <p>On Mr Jospin's election, in 1997, he promised to put an end to this long-standing practice, known as the \"cumul des mandats\", demanding that the members of his cabinet devote themselves full-time to running their ministries. He has run up against something of a rebellion. </p> <p>Besides Ms Aubry, the environment minister, Dominique Voynet, has said she intends to stand as mayor in Dole and will resign if she wins. The European affairs minister, Pierre Moscovici, will be campaigning for the town hall in Montb\u00e9liard, eastern France, and the agriculture minister, Jean-Claude Gayssot, in B\u00e9ziers in the south. </p> <p>The highly ambitious Ms Aubry will not be leaving the national stage for good. She will certainly be appointed to the Socialist party's national secretariat later this year and providing the polls remain favourable - she has consistently been one of the country's five most popular politicians - she could well use Lille town hall as a springboard for a run at the premiership in 2002, and possibly even at the presidency thereafter. </p> <p>For the Socialist candidate for prime minister, at least, she will in all probability have a female rival in the shape of the present justice minister, Elisabeth Guigou. Every bit as determined, ambitious and competent as Ms Aubry, Ms Guigou is another rising star of the French left - and the minister hotly tipped to take up the labour portfolio following Ms Aubry's departure next week. </p> <p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, however, it could be local politics that upsets that plan. Ms Guigou has announced her intention of standing for the town hall in the Provencal town of Avignon. If she wins, Mr Jospin will have to choose between sticking to his principles, or allowing the provinces to deprive him of another of his most effective ministers. </p> <p>In a presidential indicator poll published last week, Ms Guigou for the first time clocked a higher popularity rating than her northern rival - 41% against 39%. </p> <p>That will certainly encourage the frighteningly efficient justice minister in her undeclared aim of stepping into Mr Jospin's shoes when the prime minister has his tilt at the presidency in 2002. The only question is whether she will be launching that campaign from the employment ministry, Avignon town hall - or perhaps both.</p>",
  "What do we know? That rich folks in Midland, Texas, have to look after each other, because that's the way it is in big Bush country. That - dang my dingbat hide! - Al Gore loves huntin' and fishin' alongside Tommy Lee Jones. And that young Willie Hague grew up with just plain folks in the Rother valley \"who are the mainstream of this country\". We know, in short, that politicians are singing a curiously similar song this season. <p>\"Come and meet the people I grew up with,\" said a lyrical Willie. \"Children of proud mothers who struggled on small budgets, who relied on the local health service and who hoped for a better life for their sons and daughters. Children of fathers who worked hard in the mines and on farms and in steelworks and who never knew the security of owning a home or saving for a pension, who had no choice but to live from one week's pay packet to the next ... These are the people who motivate me.\" </p> <p>Now, I don't mean to impugn Mr Hague's sincerity - or, indeed, his inspiring memory of a time before some nameless lady closed those mines and shut those steelworks. The point is style, not substance. The point is that, for a fiercely independent nation run by similarly fired politicians, we seem pathetically eager to nick whatever American convention rhetoric happens to be going. </p> <p>That \"proud mum\" passage is pure Gore (and only lightly filtered Bush). It doesn't now fall from Hague's lips by accident (any more than it was a Brighton accident to hear Gordon Brown banging on about \"hardworking families\" or Tony Blair \"fighting\" an apparently eternal fight). They're all at it, all copycatting, all nicking away. </p> <p>Thus one Tory spinmeister could be found in Bournemouth last week explaining that the new, inclusive stuff about \"the poor and the dispossessed\" didn't mean they expected the financially afflicted to vote for them - just that it would make middle-classes defectors feel less guilty about returning to the tax-lopping fold. Great unholy rip-offs! Didn't I hear a Republican spinmeister say exactly the same in Philadelphia? Reader, I did. </p> <p>Whether we like it or not, whether we even realise it or not, our election and theirs are rattling along the same barren track, invoking the same arid \"visions\", mouthing the same desiccated words. Which means that one of the most fascinating questions about both contests is increasingly relevant, too. </p> <p>Call it the question that Kevin Keegan kept ask himself rather too often and rather too prematurely. Call it the question Slobodan Milosevic declines to put. Not who's won, but what happens to the losers? </p> <p>Let's be cavalier about the two camps of our present rulers. There's no great need to linger too long over the prospective defeat of New Labour, or of Bill Clinton's slightly less new Democrats. One would be an earthquake consigning Blair and Brown to an early political grave; but the scope for shift available to, say, Blunkettism isn't so great. No Labour replacement is going to bring the Bank of England back under political control or challenge the will of the global markets. Equally, no Democratic contender in thrall to focus groups will abandon the middle ground. </p> <p>The vanquished of the centre left, next time round, would still stand much where they stand today in all but slogans. They might be desperately disappointed; they would not yet be utterly desperate. Neither Hague nor Bush, however, has that cushion. They are pretty desperate already - and Republican desperation deserves scrutiny, because it is also the Conservative future. </p> <p>How, on this side of the Atlantic, does George W strike you? As a born-again bigot, an international ignoramus, a grinder of the poor and executor of the innocent, as a commander-in-chief only Dr Strangelove could love? Alas, this is the cartoon Bush peddled deliberately to his own party, the Bush who unites by embracing the headlines of the right and the small print of mushy moderation. In victory, he would not seem so very terrifying: more ineffectual, like his dad. Colin Powell would do the business, George would do the smirks. </p> <p>But if Bush loses, if the polls that once looked so sunny for him keep raining on his parade, then the knives are out. The Republicans will do what they threatened to do before the party fixers produced a candidate and a strategy they believed could win: they will tear themselves apart. </p> <p>Republicans - even today, before the knife turns - are barely civil about each other. The moderates, who have to reach beyond narrow ideological constituencies to get elected, hate the senators, congressmen and governors (mostly in small states) who don't. The Californian liberals hate the southern rednecks. The agnostic card-carriers hate the Christian Coalition: and vice-versa. Only the prospect of power keeps this increasingly dissident lot together, clustered inside a very big tent. But if that power - the natural hegemony they began to take for granted in the 80s - is once more denied, then carnage inevitably follows. </p> <p>John McCain's gallant rebellion wasn't a fluke: it was the harbinger of splits to come, a necessary showdown between those who seek to speak for and to an entire nation, to include everyone, and those who run a more exclusive, more moneyed, more self-serving club. </p> <p>Welcome to Bournemouth. Michael Portillo made the McCain speech; Ann Widdecombe did the Newt Gingrich memorial rant; and Hague played George W. Even his ritual attack on New Labour - on \"the waste and the lies and the cronies and the sycophants\" - was a Bush hand-me-down, what George says about Clinton every time his campaign train stops at a level crossing. It wasn't important any longer to see Tory division in terms of Europe. That, for the moment, is banished to the fringes. The inclusion debate - the debate that obsesses Republicans - had taken over. </p> <p>The \"ladder of opportunity\" to the underclass was being lowered and no child who could scramble up it would be left behind. \"Hard-working, hard-pressed\" climbers of that ladder could join the Conservative Club. The deserving poor would be suitably cared for. And what of those who remained? The indolent, the damaged, the drop-outs and council-house cannabis puffers, the second-rate citizenry (as Tory defined) who won't go away? </p> <p>This isn't the \"One Nation\" pitch of Macmillan or Macleod. This is the choice on which America is poised to pass final judgment, the inhalers against the exhalers. (Yip: even shambles and evasions over pot follow the mazy trans-Atlantic plot.) </p> <p>Losing matters. Hague expects to lose, but not badly enough for the chop. His would-be successors are jockeying already, edging to right and to left, planning for 2006, lighting the joints. Place your bets - but if George W goes down, don't waste money on Hague. Here's another smoke-filled centre that won't hold. </p> <p>\u0095 peter.preston@theguardian.com</p>",

  "<p>Ten years ago today, Britain joined the exchange rate mechanism. It was, according to the gushing hyperbole of those who had championed the cause of entry a great day, as momentous an occasion as when the abolition of the corn laws marked the triumph of free trade over protectionism. </p> <p>Britain's two-year sojourn inside the ERM was certainly momentous, although not in the way its supporters envisaged. The experience has left deep political scars, aggravating an innate suspicion of the way European institutions operate. Tony Blair knows this, which is why he sought last week to assuage fears that power was remorselessly sucked out of the hands of the public by calling for a second chamber to the European parliament made up of prominent national MPs. </p> <p>Mr Blair has the right idea, but he chose the wrong target. The real problem with the EU is not its toothless parliament but its over-mighty central bank. Without root and branch reform of the way the European central bank operates, it is hard to envisage the UK voting for the euro, even were the government foolish enough to propose that the ECB - as currently constituted - be allowed to set interest rates here. </p> <p>One of the anomalies about the debate here is that those most exercised by the UK's so-called \"feudal\" constitution fail to raise a complaint about the ECB which - with its mixture of elitism, arrogance and incompetence - is as remote as the court of Louis XVI was from the people of pre-revolutionary France. </p> <p>Let's start with some fundamentals. By their nature, all independent central banks are undemocratic, since the whole point is that politicians should not be allowed to play fast and loose with interest rates, even if that is what voters want. The argument in favour of independent central banks is that while Sir Eddie George, say, will not appear on a ballot paper in the next election, he and the other eight members of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee make a better fist of running the economy than a chancellor with one eye on the opinion polls. There is, therefore, a trade-off between democracy and effectiveness which, after the economic horrors of the 1970s and 1980s, means that people are willing to accept less direct control over monetary policy in return for the abolition of boom and bust. In the end, so the theory goes, we might as well have Sir Eddie because he has more credibility than Gordon Brown - witness the decline in long-term interest rates since 1997. Provided the right procedures for transparency and accountability are put in place, losing the ability to turf out those setting interest rates is a small price to pay. </p> <p>Taken to its logical conclusion, this updated form of enlightened despotism could lead to all sorts of decisions being taken by experts. Allowing chancellors to cut taxes and raise spending ahead of elections could be seen as a reason for an independent fiscal policy committee, while an independent military policy committee made up of assorted brass hats would stop governments starting small wars in, let's say, the south Atlantic when polling day was looming. </p> <p>Whether the new system set up by Mr Brown will deliver better economic outcomes remains to be seen. But there is no doubt that - regardless of whether the Bank has political legitimacy - it does have credibility with the markets and with the public. The MPC's monthly meeting is seen as part of the rhythm of economic life, and enough checks and balances have been installed by the government to ensure that the Bank can not be hijacked by a group of inflation nutters. </p> <p><strong> Shrouded in secrecy</strong><br> </p> <p> Set against the ECB, the MPC is a beacon of transparency and accountability. We know little of what goes on inside Europe's central bank. Minutes of its meeting will gather dust for years before being made public, there are no voting records of the governing council, the definition of independence is so absolute that the Maastricht treaty forbids governments from even seeking to influence the decisions of the bank. This dearth of transparency and accountability means that the ECB would have to be hyper-efficient and super credible in order to make the democracy-effectiveness trade-off work. If voters and governments are to give up a lot of political leverage to Frankfurt they are right to expect compensation in the form of economic policies that really deliver in terms of jobs and growth, as well as the traditional Bundesbank staples of low inflation and a stable currency. </p> <p>So far, this has not happened. The euro's 25% decline in value against the dollar since its launch has led to higher import costs at a time when oil prices have been rising fast. As a result, infla tion has breached the ECB's 2% ceiling, prompting it to raise rates at a time when unemployment is still running at 9%. Wim Duisenberg expressed confidence last week that euroland had reached \"cruising altitude\", but recent data from Germany and France suggested it may be stalling. </p> <p>We are, of course, not allowed to know how the debate went inside the ECB last week. But the sense is that the bank is stuck in the tramlines of textbook economic thinking - that to be effective any intervention in the currency markets has to be followed by a tightening of monetary policy. </p> <p>But the message of the past 10 years is that the economic textbooks - or at least the ones that the ECB is using - are way out of date. Where foreign exchange markets used to be attracted to a currency by high interest rates, these days they tend to be more concerned about an economy's growth potential. Central banks no longer win credibility simply by showing how tough they are, and the ECB's obsession with price stability looks not just anachronistic but self-defeating when an increase in interest rates leads to a weaker euro, which in turn exacerbates price pressures. </p> <p>The ECB is thus offering the worst of both worlds - a lack of democracy and a lack of effectiveness. The impression it gives of being out of touch and not up to the job explains not just the outcome in the Danish referendum but the draining away of support in those countries denied a referendum. </p> <p>There are two ways in which the ECB could turn the situation around. It could rewrite its constitution so that its minutes and voting record were released - like the MPC's - after two weeks rather than 16 years. It could adopt a broader remit which - like the federal reserve's - incorporated growth and employment in addition to price stability. It could adopt a symmetrical inflation target rather than stick to a 2% ceiling, a commitment which institutionalises deflationary macroeconomic policies. The ECB governing council could allow itself to be grilled by the parliaments of all euroland members. But let's face it. The chances of this happening are negligible. </p> <p><strong> Opportunity knocks</strong><br> </p> <p> That leaves the alternative route, becoming a more effective central bank. Here the glint of an opportunity is opening up, because there is a risk that the signs of distress from some of the big names of corporate America presage a more rapid slowdown in the US than has been factored into the currency markets. If the US suffers a hard landing the dollar will come down and the euro will rally. The idea that the strong dollar is entirely the result of inward investment by European and Japanese companies seeking to buy in to the American productivity miracle is not supported by the evidence. Much of the dollar's strength is down to hot money, and hot money can leave as quickly as it arrives. </p> <p>But the end of the boom in the US would have profound effects on the rest of the world. Growth would slow everywhere, and it would be up to Europe to replace America as the engine of the global economy. That would mean being prepared to emulate Alan Greenspan in 1998, when he cut rates at a time of rapid expansion because the risks of a 1930s-style slump were seen as greater than those of 1980s-style inflation. But that means being innovative, being prepared to take a risk. Thus far there is not the slightest sign that Mr Duisenberg has any of these qualities. The reason could be that far from making institutions more effective, a lack of democracy could actually weaken them. Now there's a thought. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:larry.elliott@theguardian.com\">larry.elliott@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "Show Janet Paraskeva a poisoned chalice and her response would probably be to swig it in one go, but only after checking quietly that the antidote she took earlier was the correct one. The woman charged with making the Law Society's reform programme happen is an instinctive seeker after alarming challenges; and galvanising the solicitors' venerable but troubled body is definitely one of those. <p>The complaints system is a mess, the staff are recovering from the bullying traumas of former vice-president Kamlesh Bahl, and relations with the Lord Chancellor, Derry Irvine, are delicate. A judge would still uphold the two-year-old verdict of Sir Dennis Stevenson, the management guru now heading the House of Lords' peer-picking committee, who was called in to review the Law Society's workings. He concluded that the committee-heavy body just didn't work. </p> <p>The profession will find itself looking down its nose at the Paraskeva part of the solution, because its new chief executive is small and quick. She is also systematic and very determined. The public's great grouse against snail-like complaints handling will be top priority. Lord Irvine meanwhile faces a nimble advocate for open, fair (\"And where are all the ethnic minority, women and solicitor QCs and judges, Derry?\") procedures in the mist-surrounded appointment system that has him and the society at odds. </p> <p>The fact that the solicitors badly wanted Paraskeva for the new, \u00a3120,000-a-year post, and have launched her with a tribute from president Michael Napier to new \"vision, determination and energy,\" is telling. At an early stage in the process, the Daily Mail will have been exhibit A, with its regular chipping at her support for cannabis legalisation and juxtapositions of gay and lesbian grants from the National Lottery Charities Board (NLCB, whose huge English operation she has directed from the start) and the fact that she is divorced and wears trouser suits. </p> <p>But the sound of tutting from solicitors' offices has been wonderfully inaudible, not just in London (where the Evening Standard savaged Ann Widdecombe's contrasting views on drug law last week) but also in the regions. It is this part of the 175-year-old Law Society's membership that may get to meet the new chief exec first. One of her main legacies at the NLCB is a rock-solid regional structure with the HQ in Leicester rather than London. </p> <p>Settling into her new Chancery Lane office, she looks forward to that but puts the need for an overall efficient system first. \"The most important lesson I bring from the Charities Board is that you need to handle paperwork quickly. That, and a lot of experience in managing people who object to decisions - to NLCB grants or to the way grant applications were evaluated.\" </p> <p>She and her colleagues - not especially radical: the NLCB chairman was an Hon and his deputy a Sir - were not going to satisfy everyone, when initial odds against getting a Lottery grant were 14-1 and there was no consensus on what constituted a \"good cause\". But they armed themselves with a huge preliminary consultation of 8,000 voluntary groups. \"Then we set up a clear set of processes and procedures, properly looked-at, properly constituted and fair to all.\" </p> <p>It didn't always look like that in early NLCB days, with computers emitting steam and staff working way beyond closing time, but there wasn't the bullying or rigid party line that often comes with system-freaks. Recovering from the legacy of Bahl, who had staff in tears (and may again next month, when she brings race and sex discrimination charges at an employment tribunal), the Law Society needs that less than most. </p> <p>Paraskeva can be ruthless, and some well-intentioned members of NLCB voluntary committees got the bullet for straying over very strict rules about links with grant applications; but every decision came with a transparent, A-Z explanation of why it had been taken. The words \"audit office\" were held over staff entrusted with hundreds of millions of public money, and all Dail Mail attempts to show that refugees or ex-cons or even pigs at an urban farm (with snout-operated showers) were unworthy, were satisfyingly stuffed. </p> <p>The NLCB was a new institution, however, and Paraskeva acknowledges the different challenge of an ancient body, where tensions over change have seen internal dramas, factions, and see-saws over strops with the Lord Chancellor. She will ease herself in: \"The consultation process over changes is already well under way. I will be putting my tuppenceworth in, but above all listening to people at every level and maybe especially at the coal face. You need to be constantly on the lookout for someone who comes up with that bright idea you didn't have.\" </p> <p>At 54, she wanted the job \"because I've got time for one more big challenge\". She also has the overt enthusiasm that only curmudgeons resent. She zoomed from a Greek-Cypriot, restaurant-owning family headed by a Greek-Cypriot father and Welsh mother, through work as a teacher and schools inspector to running the National Youth Agency, coupled with work as a JP, member of Leicester university council and trustee of the citizenship group Common Purpose. She is greatly proud of her two daughters, one a teacher and the other a potter. If there are curmudgeons in the Society, they may be softened by memos on postcards of ceramics by Paraskeva Junior.</p>",
  "<p>Old buildings no longer die, they are regenerated and reborn. Out of the past comes the present, out of dereliction comes resurrection. We take our old industrial past, dust it down, clean it up and transform it into our own vision of a future where there is time to stop and stare. Where there once stood great machines there is now art. Hallelujah. </p> <p>Following Tate Modern comes the Wapping Project, a new centre for the arts based in the old Wapping Hydraulic Power Station in east London. This is an area of London upon which the economy of Empire relied - our own industrial Venice, a complex network of waterways and working-class histories and homes. The Hydraulic power station shows us how London worked. </p> <p>The Hydraulic power station was built in 1890, opposite the Prospect of Whitby pub, London's oldest surviving riverside inn, built in 1543 and originally known as the Devil's Tavern. The pub has the air of a rural cottage transposed to the city, and the Victorian power station, with its mellow brickwork and folly-like, creeper-clad tower even more so, as if its designers wanted to disguise the power that was housed within. And make no mistake, it was power. Coal delivered to the adjacent Shadwell Basin was used to fire six steam boilers and their pumping engines. The station provided power not just to the surrounding docks but throughout central London. It was the envy of a power-hungry world and was the model for similar stations as far afield as New York and Argentina. </p> <p>The introduction of two electric turbine pumps in 1923 heralded the station's heyday. More than 33m gallons of water a week were pumped underneath the streets of London. Tower Bridge depended on hydraulic power, the revolving stages of both the London Palladium and the Coliseum were powered hydraulically, as were numerous lifts in City offices and West End department stores and the organ console at the Odeon Marble Arch. </p> <p>But the arrival in mid-century of cheaper electricity spelled the end for the need for hydraulic power. Such stations began to shut down. The one at Wapping was the very last working hydraulic power station in the world when it closed its doors in 1977. </p> <p>For the next 16 years the building and its contents fell into dereliction. Then on a November morning in 1993, Jules Wright, the artistic director of the Women's Playhouse Trust, on the look out for a suitable building for the Trust, was being taken on a tour of possible sites by the London Docklands Development Corporation. The LDDC then was keen to encourage arts activity in an area that was only just beginning to see signs of regeneration. Wright was tired, the buildings she had already seen were unpromising, but she agreed to the detour to Wapping. She walked through the door, took one look and said: \"I am going to have this place.\" </p> <p>She has, too, even though the lottery turned down her application for funding - up against competition from projects such as the Royal Opera House and Sadler's Wells in the first dash for lottery loot. Almost every penny of the \u00a34m the building has cost so far she has raised herself. Wright, who moved to London from Australia in 1974, isn't entirely sorry about the lack of public funding. \"I do like not having to spend my life ticking little boxes and doing what other people tell you,\" she says, with typical Australian forthrightness. She waves an arm expansively: \"Who knows, if we had had \u00a328m rather than \u00a34m, we might have wrecked the place.\" </p> <p>Wright, and her architects Shed 54 Limited, led by her husband Joshua Wright, haven't. The building is as idiosyncratic as Wright herself. And it is dense with atmosphere. The aim has been to keep as much of the existing building structure and machinery as possible, and to maintain both the atmosphere of the power station's industrial past and the archeological detail that underpins it. </p> <p>Wright describes the architects' job as matching \"the functional purity of the original. Their work is often quiet to the point of self-effacement. In some ways self-effacement is its point, simply reinforcing the existing forms, shapes and volumes and emphasising the industrial scale so that their work relates to the building, not to the human scale.\" </p> <p>There is an air of architectural impermanence in stairs that do not touch the ground but appear to float and others made from untreated steel that will eventually achieve a dusting of rust. But just as the conversion of the building plays constant homage to its history and its watery past, so its contents will too. </p> <p>The transformation of the boiler and filter houses, both stripped back to their 1890 form, has created exhibition and performance areas that are potentially the most exciting in London. At last the capital has a space for installation and performance that has the epic sweep of Glasgow's Tramway, and is both functional and eerily beautiful. This is a space that demands an artistic response that is bold, contemporary and radical. </p> <p>The programme kicks off with WPC's commission of Jane Prophet's installation Conductor, which provides the link between the building's industrial past and its new life as a cultural centre. For Conductor, 120 lengths of fibre optic cables are suspended above the flooded floor of the former boiler house so that they are reflected to a seemingly infinite depth that is intermittently disrupted by ripples created by the action of a water pump. </p> <p>It seems a long way from the founding of the WPT and its first ever production, a revival of Aphra Behn's rarely performed restoration satire The Lucky Chance, at the Royal Court in 1984. Yet just as that production was about reclaiming the dispossessed past, the work of WPT has also always been about ensuring that women have a place - and a space - right in the forefront of Britain's cultural life. </p> <p>\"I have never been interested in the WPT doing hole-in-the-wall work. Women artists need big opportunities,\" says Wright. The tide may go in and out when it comes to the profile of women in the arts, but expect plenty of ripples emanating from Wapping in the coming months. </p> <p>\u0095 The Wapping Project opens on Saturday.

  "I met \"dodgy Dave\" seven years ago on the mighty cobalt-blue San Rafael glacier surging down from the northern Patagonian ice sheet, just a few hundred miles from the tip of south America. It was pouring with rain, he was living out of a rucksack, eating unimaginably bad food, climbing mountains, measuring glacier melt and reroofing barns. He couldn't believe his luck. Raleigh International, with help from his local authority, had sent him to a Chilean wilderness to learn the age-old British establishment arts of initiative training, teamwork and character-building. <p>Dave, frankly, didn't care much for the outdoor life. But he knew about survival, specifically on the streets of Newcastle upon Tyne. Like Prince William, who has just arrived at San Rafael to begin his 10-week expedition in Patagonia, he was one of Raleigh International's \"venturers\", but one of the few who come from what Raleigh call \"at risk\" backgrounds. </p> <p>Dave, like Prince William, came to Chile with a personal history that most of the 17 to 25 year olds who go on to Raleigh's 10 annual expeditions could only gasp at. By 18, he had been in and out of reform schools and been done several times for nicking cars. Now 23 and unemployed, he hadn't told Raleigh the real reason why he wanted to come. </p> <p>Some bloke in Newcastle, he said, had asked him to deliver a package to Manchester and Dave, foolishly, had opened it and then even more foolishly substituted something. \"They\" were after him big-time, he said. Dave was on the run and the safest place in the world for him was among the glaciers and the international kids. </p> <p>Where most of the other venturers came from middle-class homes, were straight out of school and the pony club or doing a gap year before or after university, he was tough as nails. He felt an academic and social oddball but as the weeks went on he joined in the Cilla Black impersonations, learned to like - if not love - the daily porridge and sardines, and opened up to the madcap enthusiasm. Between the real physical adventures and the campfire culture, he was haunted about what would happen when he got back. \"Maybe I'll just carry on travelling,\" he said. \"I could go on to America, anywhere. It's OK for most of these people. The trouble is that I can't hide.\" </p> <p>Dave could scarcely believe how sheltered, naive or plain ignorant the majority of the British venturers were. Some had worked hard to raise the \u00a34,000 needed to come, but others had raised the cash in a single party for friends or, like Prince William, had got help from Dad. Some had never left home, or even camped before, others were more at home on a pony or in a lecture hall. Some were public school high-fliers being sponsored by international companies and were trying to advance their carers, yet others saw themselves at personal crossroads - trying to decide what to do or wanting to get out of boring jobs, or relationships. </p> <p>But boy, did they have a good time. Halfway into the 10 weeks almost everyone testified to being happier than ever before. Many had amazed themselves at what they had done. Kayaking through ice flows and camping above the snowline, climbing around glaciers, walking 30 miles a day and making snow shelters and skimming over lagoons in inflatables had stretched most of them. All had caught the adventure bug, and with many of the hunky or horsey volunteer minders falling in love with each other, it made for a heady brew. \"It was like being on another planet\", said Martin, a 20-year-old from Kent. </p> <p>\"It was a seminal period of my life,\" says Kirsty Monro from Ilkley in Yorkshire, who was in Chile in 1993. Now an artist living in Majorca, she says: \"I'd repeat it a million times. You're put out of real life into a wilderness. You learn about yourself, your limits, you find out your abilities. Some people had never left home. You learn how to be with people. I felt like I lived a million lives in months.\" </p> <p>Monro recognised she was lucky finding a group of friends who are still with her seven years on. \"Some groups who go on a Raleigh expedition just don't mix. Some people have a miserable time, some get stuck with people they cannot stand. People had tantrums. It was a lottery.\" </p> <p>Raleigh takes about 1,000 17 to 25 year olds on 10 expeditions a year. When Prince Charles started it in 1978, it was run by the eccentric Colonel Blashford-Snell on strict military lines and was shamelessly adventure-oriented. Now led by Jamie Robertson-Macleod, a former Green Jacket captain and equerry to Prince Rainier of Monaco, it is billed as an international development charity and emphasises the environmental and social works the youths are expected to do. </p> <p>If anything, it has become more establishment, a youth wing of the diplomatic corps and a recruiting ground for the British army. Baroness Warwick of Undercliffe and others have attested in parliament to the \"real benefits for UK foreign policy\" that volunteering of this kind can bring. </p> <p>Raleigh gets much of its money from the government via the Darwin Initiative, UN bodies, the European commission, and everyone from the Lions Club to the Freemasons of Yorkshire. Its main \"sponsor\" in the past decade has been Inchcape, the world's largest distributor of cars. It draws heavily on former armed service personnel and recruits many of its volunteer helpers from the SAS and civil service with the Ministry of Defence sponsoring some venturers. It tends to take its expeditions to countries which Britain likes to do lucrative arms business with, many of which have or have known dictatorships. In the past few years, it has been to Indonesia, Oman, Brunei, Namibia, and Angola. </p> <p>Last year it was linked more formally to the army who will from now on fund 20 places a year for \"at risk, disadvantaged\" children, such as Dave, in return for \"helping the army raise awareness of its career opportunities among Raleigh participants\". </p> <p>The new internationalism which it espouses, tries to marry British interests abroad with personal development and good works for the needy. Wherever Raleigh goes, it is feted by embassies and local politicians. In Chile, General Pinochet just happened to land on the glacier in a helicopter as Dave and the venturers were heading that way. Prince Charles himself dropped in on one Oman group last year. The Sultan of Brunei is an admirer, as are other heads of state. Says Robertson-Macleod: \"People say that we are ambassadors.\" </p> <p>For the venturers who tend to stick to their social strata, it can be one long diplomatic party. One group in Oman, dubbed the \"dinner party set\", reported that it had found time to do its own own entertaining, go to the horse races and concerts, and be entertained by in the British embassy. </p> <p>But Raleigh International's semi-diplomatic status is also one of its problems. All the social and environmental work done by the venturers is with the guidance of the local min istries who are often out of contact themselves with the needs of local people. The locals often respond to the arrival of gangs of whites with a mixture of bemusement and semi-resentment. </p> <p>Raleigh volunteers were recently sent to Mount Elgon national park in Uganda to build a camping lodge for tourists. The report from the locals was not complimentary: \"The major criticism of the present development strategy [in the park] is the use of Raleigh International in the construction of tourist facilities. The applicability of a group of 12 European office workers for five weeks to build a campsite is questionable with regards sustainability. This phenomenon could be termed aid tourism, the desire of westerners to do charitable work in the developing world, with personal development a primary objective. </p> <p>\"The work of Raleigh expeditions may be of value to the nation, but as a group they are misunderstood by the local communities. Rather than assisting development they are viewed as actively taking work away from the locals. One venturer suggested that the guides and porters could organise themselves into an association and, among other activities, carry out the work their expedition was completing,\" said one member of the park staff. </p> <p>In Chile, the task for one group while I was there was to rebuild a barn which had been destroyed several years previously following a volcanic eruption. The local farmer had provided new beech shingles tiles and watched in amazement as 25 peo ple with no knowledge of carpentry or roofing proceeded to botch the job in record time. It would be a miracle if that barn is still standing today. </p> <p>Robertson-Macleod says that the number of complaints Raleigh has today is \"far fewer\" than seven years ago. He admits that in the early days Raleigh was often not sophisticated. \"We know we have a lot to learn. We don't want to be building things that are not needed. We need community interaction. People are generally very happy with our work. On an average expedition to Africa now, 30% of the venturers are from the host country. We are not telling people what they should do. The idea of venturers being patronising or colonial is just wrong.\" </p> <p>Most of the work building schools, dams, or old people's homes, helping local or British scientists, he says, would not be done were it not for Raleigh. Nevertheless, the venturers I was with were given no briefing of the politics of the country, no overview of the wider social or physical environment and no expectation was made of them to learn the local languages. </p> <p>Prince William has now arrived in Patagonia and, says Robertson Macleod, there are \"amazing\" stories coming back of how well the expedition is going - which he will not share because St James's palace would \"skin\" him. What happens when the prince returns will be another matter: many of the venturers say they find it hard to readjust. Many change jobs and lifestyles. </p> <p>For Dave, it didn't work out too well. He was last heard of in trouble with the police. For Prince William, the next 10 weeks will be reality suspended, a mix of sheer bliss, utter terror at the physical extremes and, just like Dave, a very uncertain homecoming.</p>",
  "<p>Enough water has been saved in repairing leaky water mains in the past five years to supply an extra 13m people - forcing water companies to abandon plans for costly new reservoirs. </p> <p>Imminent fears of water shortages in the south of England voiced in 1997 have evaporated as a result. </p> <p>The extraordinary turnaround has occurred because suppliers of water have been forced into large-scale repairs and replacement of Victorian water mains after a public outcry over leakage rates. </p> <p>Thames Water had claimed supplies were running low and wanted to build a giant new reservoir in Oxfordshire to supply London, while at the same time 30% of its water supply to the capital was disappearing through leaky pipes. </p> <p>But the water companies' desire to build new reservoirs was not an altruistic gesture. Under the bizarre rules on water charges developed during privatisation it meant that if they spent large sums on capital projects they could put up customers' bills. </p> <p>If companies simply repaired pipes they could not charge extra. </p> <p>This enraged John Prescott, and immediately after the election the new environment secretary called a water summit and read the riot act, demanding that before any new reservoirs were built leakage rates were reduced. The companies were all set mandatory targets to reduce leakage. </p> <p>Ofwat, the government's water industry watchdog, says that as a result of this policy leakage rates have dropped 35% since their peak in 1994. The need for new sources of water has been further reduced by a massive increase in the use of water meters, which save customers money and cut water use, and by a public education programme of wise use of water. </p> <p>The leakage rate from pipes in some water companies' areas is still high - particularly to the untutored eye. The national average is 16% wastage between the water works and the customers' taps. </p> <p>Some water companies do far better than that. Anglia, which is the driest part of the country, had a leakage rate of 13% five years ago and has further reduced it to 11%. </p> <p>Thames, the largest company, is still seen as the villain of the piece. It has dropped its leakage rate from 24% to 19% in the same period, and Severn Trent the second largest from 24% to 12%. </p> <p>Thames is under pressure to do better, and Bill Emery, Ofwat's director of costs and performance, accuses the company in his report of not employing \"best practice\" when estimating leaks - possible code for cheating. </p> <p>Andrew Boyd for Thames said: \"We have agreed to amend our methods to best practice. It does not mean we are cheating, merely that we are adjusting our methods so everyone uses the same. We are pretty sure our figures have integrity.\" </p> <p>The company says it has three particular difficulties that are not faced by any other water company. </p> <p>It has more tall buildings that any other operator so it has to keep water at higher pressure to reach top flats - so more water is squeezed through leaks. </p> <p>Second, the London clay has a corrosive effect on old pipes making them leak more. Third and perhaps worst, most mains lie under heavily congested London streets making replacement and repair seriously difficult without disrupting London. </p> <p>The big issue for Ofwat now is how much further to push water companies to reduce leakage. </p> <p>Some companies, such as Anglia, have already gone below their statutory targets, although Thames has got to save another 8% of leakage. </p> <p>Willie Abu Judeh, Anglia's supply demand manager, said: \"Once you get to a certain point investing in new resources is cheaper than spending money on cutting leakage. Maybe when new technology comes along it will be easier to repair leaks but at the moment we feel about 11% leakage is as far as we can go economically. </p> <p>\"For us the next big thing is meters: we have got up to 50%, some companies are only at 10%. That saves a lot too.\" </p> <p>Thames with 20,000 miles of main and 18m joints, all of which could leak, is continuing with its pipe repair and replacement programme. </p> <p>Currently the company has officially abandoned all thoughts of new reservoirs, believing that foreseeable needs can be met from water savings.</p>",
  "The government is to spend nearly \u00a3250,000 on a pre-Christmas advertising campaign urging the public not to give cash to beggars. <p>The campaign strengthens the message of the rough sleepers unit to encourage the genuinely homeless into hostels, rather than surviving on the streets where they are more likely to be prey to drugs and alcohol abuse. Research shows that the longer the homeless spend on the streets the more difficult it is to encourage them back into work and society. </p> <p>The Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions said the adverts, planned for newspapers, would not be instructing people to turn down appeals for cash from beggars but would urge them to give help in kind, such as blankets or clothes. The text, still being drafted, might suggest as an alternative that Christmas goodwill take the form of donations to, or voluntary work for, charities for the homeless. </p> <p>The rough sleepers unit, part of the DETR, drew up the proposals after a report from the Cabinet Office's social exclusion unit in 1998. A DETR official said: \"We want to make sure that people who receive help are genuinely homeless, but many people begging on the streets are really trying to feed a drugs habit.\" </p> <p>She admitted that the government had not under taken a scientific survey to estimate the number of beggars who were genuinely homeless, but most came from institutional backgrounds, such as care homes or the army. </p> <p>She said homeless charities had been consulted about the advert. The contract for the campaign had been given to the Leith advertising agency, but everything was still at the planning stage. </p> <p>Rory Gilbert, deputy chief executive of the Big Issue, one of the organisations consulted by the unit, criticised the plan: \"Telling people what to do in this way is ridiculous. Often people who are begging are not actually homeless. Not giving to them does not help people off the streets.\" </p> <p>However, Alex Hughes, the Salvation Army's territorial commander in the UK, broadly supported the campaign as the only way for people inclined to be generous to avoid having their money spent on drugs or drink. </p> <p>The unit is committed to taking people off the streets and into homeless hostels. However, many homeless people appear to prefer spending nights in doorways and relying on the generosity of passers-by or soup runs. </p> <p>Since 1998 the number of rough sleepers in England at any one time is estimated to have fallen from 1,850 to 1,180. The government is committed to cutting the number by two thirds by the end of 2002, requiring a further reduction of 580, a target the DETR says it is on course to reach.</p>",
  "<p> A scene of dreamy serenity is not one you readily associate with Macaulay Culkin, the biggest child star since Shirley Temple, whose career disintegrated six years ago. But there he was below us on the stage of the Vaudeville with his co-star Ir\u00e8ne Jacob (the star of Krzysztof Kieslowski's Three Colours: Red), patiently playing a little low-key verbal ping pong while the technical crew worked out the lighting. </p> <p>If ever there was a context for petulance or tantrums, this was it. During a technical run-through the actors are nothing but objects to be lit, expected to do their moves and say their lines unemphatically over and over, with no one really listening. Every now and then a voice from below told them to take it from some point where the light was not quite right and they began again, in playful exchanges, savouring their lines for pitch and rhythm, getting the feel of the old British theatre. </p> <p>Just five years ago every professional and family blemish of the Culkins was heaped on to the ravenous tabloid pyre as their custody and financial battles crowded the courts. Culkin's parent manager, Kit, was, \"a father from hell\"; the Home Alone prodigy, we were led to understand, was a little Lord of the Flies himself, raining down cigarette butts from his very own 11th floor Manhattan apartment. </p> <p>By contrast, the first thing that strikes you about this willowy and rather fragile young man, now aged 20, are the pronounced good manners (\"May I smoke?\") reminiscent of that other delicate child star, Freddie Bartholomew. Culkin is clearly no Little Lord Fauntleroy, though. Nor, refreshingly, is there anything of the self-consciously brash Dead End Kid about him (brought up in the Upper East Side of New York, he could have qualified). There is a suggestion of determination in his air of manly relaxation. Here is a young man who was hit at a very early age with two of the scourges of life which pass for good fortune - fame and money in stupefying abundance - and has worked out his own way of taming them. </p> <p>Culkin talks knowingly about the destructive effect of a fever for money. \"I remember one time near the end of school year, I was walking down the road with my mother saying what I wanted to do this summer and suddenly I knew there was something she did not want to tell me. She said: 'Don't make plans this summer. You might be working.' Then you find out they had already signed the contract.\" </p> <p>Culkin's father first teamed up with his common law wife, Patricia Brentrup, in North Dakota, and they lived a hippy life before settling in New York. The children - five boys and two girls - did not discover that their parents weren't married until the custody case. Kit had appeared in bit parts on Broadway with Olivier and Burton, but made no headway. He appears to have had acting plans for all the family. Kit was briefly a taxi driver, and while Macaulay was growing up he was a sacristan at their local church, St Joseph's of Yorkville, on the Upper East Side. \"It has always given me a kind of tainted view of religion,\" says Culkin. \"He used to serve mass every day and I'd see him in the back opening up the box [the tabernacle ] and taking out the crackers [the hosts]. He was the puppeteer, kind of thing.\" In later years the description was to fit even better. </p> <p>The children were raised in various New York tenements until they struck movie gold. At the height of their success they took over two floors of a fashionable Upper West Side block. By all accounts domestic life was always chaotic. But within four years of Culkin's first success the couple's relationship was on the rocks. </p> <p>Culkin's extraordinary story is in many ways the product of a deregulated Hollywood. A Mickey Rooney might have become a world star overnight, but the contract system ensured that a star could have global fame but still earn no more than a bank manager for years. Within a year - from the $100,000 brought in by Home Alone (1990) to the $8m (plus 5% of the gross - already $375m by this year) they got from Home Alone 2 (1992) - the Culkins had been given both fame and staggering wealth, the latter alone disorientating enough for most people. </p> <p>The notion that you can actually take your life in hand and alter it occurs to very few, celebrity or nonentity; the teenager who has the maturity to realise that he has all he will ever need materially, and deliberately dumps both fame and money, is a thoroughly unobserved species. And there are plenty who would put Culkin's virtual disappearance from our screens down more to the fading appeal of an ageing child star than any choice on his part. </p> <p>Certainly, the low returns for The Pagemaster, Getting Even With Dad and Richie Rich knocked him off the list of bankable stars. But Culkin's own account of grabbing control of his life, of choosing to get off the Hollywood conveyor belt on to which his father had so effectively delivered him, is convincing. \"What happened was that my father just was not around one day. He just upped and left without explaining himself to anyone.\" Fourteen years old, Culkin saw his opportunity. </p> <p>\"When I finally got the chance to say, 'I don't want to do this any more,' I said to my family and my representatives: 'I'm stopping. Call it what you want - call it retirement, say whatever you want, because it has nothing to do with me any more. I am not a press statement.' So I went to college - and found romance.\" He makes a rueful face at this reference to his very brief marriage. In June 1998 he married 17-year-old actress Rachel Miner. They separated this August. </p> <p>Culkin might still be trapped in the business but for a fatal mistake by his father: it never occurred to Kit to involve the child in what they were doing. \"I've done 14 films and never looked at one script. I was just a machine. My father would go over what I was doing next day, I'd go on the set, do it, come home, go over what we were going to do the next morning. I had really no sense of the actual film. After a while I did not care any more. I had been wanting to stop since I was about 11.\" </p> <p> He expresses little rancour towards his father. \"I was just not willing to let him control my life on many levels. People who know him say: 'He was a great manager but I'd hate him as a father.' I haven't seen or heard from him for a bunch of years, about three and a half. Actually, I think he needs that time more than I do. Hopefully at some point he will realise some of the things he has done. But I understand my parents put me in the financial position I am in today and I am grateful for that.\" </p> <p>At the height of his career Culkin travelled with his father most of the time, and became increasingly anguished at being away from his brothers and sisters so much. This need for family life surfaced in a remark he made while telling how he was already financially independent for life: \"I found myself in a position where I could lock myself in a room and watch television for the rest of my life.\" Then, rather touchingly, he added: \"Even then my kids would still be able to go to college.\" </p> <p>They were a very close family, physically at least. \"We lived in an apartment that was basically a hallway, set with doorways but with no doors. Five of us slept in two bunk beds. It was very odd; we still lived in the same tenement for two years after we had money. We were so used to living in a one-room apartment that when we moved into a big place we were still living like we were in a small place. We were not used to having our clothes in the laundry every day. Those new things took some getting used to.\" He has recently bought an apartment for himself. </p> <p>Culkin talks with maturity about his singular brush with high-wattage fame. \"When I was young I had to turn off because I couldn't let anyone hurt me any more. It was probably when I was nine and everything was happen ing. One day you are an average kid walking down the street and the next this kid is peering in your window trying to get a glimpse of you. That was too much for me to handle. I didn't have any friends. I was one of those kids who lock themselves in a room and drown themselves in television.\" </p> <p>Finally, after four years' silence, he called his agent a year ago, and now he finds himself in Madame Melville, which has the well-worn theme of a boy being seduced by his French teacher. He is generously loyal to the team (Richard Nelson, the play's writer and director, and his fellow actors) behind an enterprise which leaves him very vulnerable. For former child stars their first kiss was the great career leap, but Culkin appears about to dive headlong into the Kama Sutra. </p> <p>Does he realise how the tabloids will treat his revealing stage debut? Imagine what they could do with, for instance, the stage direction which reads: \"She reaches inside the robe and pulls down his underpants.\" But Culkin, it seems, has been more alert to the pitfalls of stripping on stage than some other recent Hollywood imports; the underpants scene has been excised. \"We thought that was too much. It was going too far, too fast at that stage.\" </p> <p>Culkin's fastidiousness even extended to a moment when the teacher, getting a light for her cigarette, puts her hand on his thigh. That has also gone, coming too early in the encounter, they (he?) judged. One scene that has survived Culkin's pencil involves him and his co-star attempting various Kama Sutra positions (fully dressed, of course). </p> <p>Culkin has come a long way since the dark days of the mid-90s, but the scars of his meteoric early success are still visible: \"It took me a long time to realise that I had deprogrammed myself slowly. I still find myself locking myself in a room, but at least I am aware of it. I know the path that leads to that and so I know the way out.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Madame Melville previews from tomorrow at the Vaudeville Theatre (020-7836 9987).</p> <p><strong>Growing pains: the making of Macaulay</strong><br>Claire Phipps</p> <p><strong> August 26, 1980: </strong><br> Born in New York to Christopher (Kit) Culkin and Patricia Brentrup, and named after 19th-century English historian Thomas Babington Macaulay. </p> <p><strong> 1988: </strong><br> Stars in long-forgotten movie Rocket Gibraltar as Burt Lancaster's grandson. </p> <p><strong> 1989:</strong><br> Makes his mark as John Candy's prankster nephew in Uncle Buck; the same cannot be said for his role in See You in the Morning. </p> <p><strong> 1990: </strong><br> The big time beckons: Culkin's face-slapping, burglar-baiting efforts in Home Alone win him a Golden Globe nomination and help to make the film the most successful comedy in US box office history.
