  "<p> The gilded staircase has gone, replaced by a circular platform covering half the stage, and a collection of classical statuary. In the second instalment of English National Opera's Italian Season, the transformation of Stefanos Lazaridis's set gives Monteverdi's The Coronation of Poppea a very different environment from the previous evening's Manon Lescaut. </p> <p>In fact, Steven Pimlott's staging does not make persistent use of the levels built into all that scaffolding. The goddess Love delivers the prologue from a platform high above the proscenium, Nero and Seneca conduct their argument across the heads of those sitting in the stalls, and Otho's escape in drag after his botched attempt to murder Octavia takes him on a circuit of the theatre at circle level - but the core of the drama is played out on that central disc, with the orchestra upstage behind it. </p> <p>Monteverdi's masterpiece was written for a paying public in 1640s Venice. It was intended to be popular music theatre - one of the first operas to concern itself with real historical characters rather than mythical beings - and Pimlott emphasises that accessibility with Ingeborg Bernerth's mix of ancient and modern costumes. Sometimes, however, he pays more attention to the theatre than the music. The score has been tactfully cut, a couple of characters omitted and others combined, so that the action is pacy and the laughs come thick and fast. If any of the audience is in any doubt that the driving force of the piece is sex, the explicitness of much of the action, from the moment that Nero makes his first entrance naked, will soon convince them. </p> <p>Words come across clearly, though in Christopher Cowell's strenuously demotic English translation, full of \"tosspots\" and \"bastards\", the natural stresses of the vocal lines often go hang for the sake of the verbal payoff. </p> <p>If all the constant romping eventually becomes tiresome, the standard of the singing never flags. First and foremost there is Alice Coote's Poppea, a wonderful combination of fanatical ambition and allure. Sarah Connolly's Octavia is a real fire-breather, Michael Chance's Otho is affectingly desperate, and Susan Gritton makes a pert Drusilla. As Seneca, Eric Owens makes one of the great bores in opera more sympathetic than usual, while Anne-Marie Owens comes up with a real party piece in Arnalta's final number. Only the American counter tenor David Walker as Nero disappoints with his reedy, petulant-sounding tone. </p> <p>Harry Christophers conducts, using a small band of strings, recorders and the usual array of plucked things. The pacing was not always as lively as it could have been, but with so much going on around him perhaps he is wise to take a back seat. </p> <p> \u0095 In rep until October 21 and live on Radio 3 on October 12.

  "<p>Today, when Lord Melchett and 27 Greenpeace protesters were cleared of causing criminal damage by wrecking an experimental crop of genetically modifed maize in Norfolk, it was a vital moment for green activists.</p> <p>The ruling is timely - it comes in the aftermath of the abject failure of the green movement to react during the fuel crisis. </p> <p>For the whole of last week, as protesters rallied and drivers complained of rising petrol prices (which have not risen since spring, but that did not stop anyone from spitting bile) environmentalists appeared cowed and silent. </p> <p>This week, their own brand of protest was upheld by Norwich crown court. </p> <p>While the people on the oil blockades claimed their protests were peaceful, they disrupted emergency services and schools and inconvenienced millions.</p> <p>But they, and the vast majority of the public who supported their case, claimed that they had a democratic right to object to fuel taxes. </p> <p>This democratic right they uphold is the right to expect no sacrifices for the future of the planet, merely to accelerate its descent into global warming and destructive freak weather conditions. </p> <p>The Melchett verdict proves there is another sort of democratic right - the right to act destructively, if such actions prevent the greater destruction of the environment.</p> <p>Norwich crown court decided that the rights of a farmer and the rights of a government are less significant than the rights of individuals to protest against the disruption of the balance of nature.</p> <p>Whether the jury agreed with the actions of Lord Melchett and his followers is not known, but they supported the spirit in which the demonstration was carried out. </p> <p>This is an extraordinary decision, which offers a substantial incentive for further field invasions and protests against experimental crop sites. </p> <p>Under government plans, 25 fields are to be planted with trial crops of maize and oilseed rape, and 30 more with either sugar or fodder beet by the end of this year.</p> <p>Herbicide resistant GM crops will be planted in one part of the sites and non-GM crops will be planted in the remaining acres. There will be more farm trials for the next two years, with results to be evaluated in 2003.</p> <p>Two of the 31 farms selected for trials have already decided not to participate in the trials. After today's decision other farmers may think carefully about conducting GM tests on their land.</p> <p>Some say the trials need to take place in order to guarantee the safety of the crops. But whether GM food can be proven 'safe' or not, few consumers want to buy it and, consequently, few supermarkets want to stock it. </p> <p>The government can hardly expect the nation to support the testing of crops which can serve little function in the food production of the country. It seems that only bully tactics and duplicitousness will persuade people to consume GM.</p> <p>The US government, supporting the interests of multinational GM-producing companies such as Monsanto, has threatened sanctions on European Union exports if EU supermarkets label GM foods as GM foods.</p> <p>This only points up just how aware the US government is of public hostility towards genetically modified food. Only by naming GM products as \"not GM\" will people be tricked into buying it. </p> <p>Whether the decision in Norwich today is a beginning of a new acknowledgment by the law of the rights of the land remains to be seen. </p> <p>For years, the Deep Ecology movement, founded by the Norwegian philosopher Arne Naess, has argued that the continuation of the life of the earth is more important than the concerns of any individual species, even humanity. </p> <p>The Norwich crown court ruling could lead the law towards reform which recognises this. Nature, having no means to petition barristers and governments, might be more frequently perceived as a passive and endangered entity, to be protected from the more rigorous attempts of humans to obliterate it. </p> <p>While people continue to fight for their prerogative to queue at garages and force the last drops of fuel into overflowing tanks, no one can be too concerned about the damage we are wilfully, ignorantly inflicting upon the planet. </p> <p>This ruling opens up a new world for environmentalists, in which to protesting on green issues does not mean being hurled into a subculture, hounded by the police and disdained by the courts. </p> <p>Today's decision also offers a brief, welcome respite from the self-interested protesting about a commodity that causes global destruction.</p> <p><strong>Useful links:</strong><br> <a href=\"http://guardianunlimited/gmdebate/Story/0,2763,370868,00.html\">Melchett cleared over GM crop damage</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org.uk\">Greenpeace UK</a></p>",
  "<p>Here is your chance to give a boost to your favourite charity, by nominating it for this year's Guardian Christmas appeal. We are looking for three charities which will benefit not only from readers' donations, but also from publicity in the Guardian over the Christmas period. </p> <p>Last year, readers gave a total of more than \u00a3200,000 to the appeal charities. The three chosen from your nominations were the Family Welfare Association, the Fairtrade Foundation and Ockenden International. A fourth charity, Friends for Deaf Young People, was chosen from the winners of the Guardian's annual award for smaller social welfare charities. And the approach will be the same this year. We are inviting readers to propose charities in three categories -domestic poverty, overseas aid and the environment. A fourth charity will again be selected from the winners of the Guardian's award, results of which will be announced next month. </p> <p>As last year, we are limiting nominations to charities with turnover of less than \u00a310m. And while smaller charities will be considered, the general aim will be to help those medium-sized organisations that are continuing to find the going tough in the increasingly competitive voluntary sector. That means the three that are chosen from readers' nominations are likely to have a turnover in excess of \u00a3500,000. </p> <p>Readers will be able to make a general donation, to be divided among the appeal charities, or identify which one they would like their money to go to. The fourth charity, selected will receive an allocation from general donations in proportion to its size. </p> <p>During the period of the appeal, the Guardian will carry articles about the work of each of the charities. There will also be regular advertisements, setting out how readers may make donations. </p> <p>Nominations should be made on the form below, or a photocopy, and must include all the information requested. Particular attention will be paid to the reasons given for why Guardian readers should help the nominated charity this year. Supporting material may be enclosed, but is not necessary. </p> <p>The deadline for nominations is Friday, October 6. A panel of senior Guardian staff will make the final choice. Charities which have already submitted applications this year need not reapply, provided all necessary information has been supplied.</p>",
  "<p>When coal-mining ended at Ollerton, Nottinghamshire, in 1994, 700 men lost their jobs; now about 300 women will join the dole queue with the closure before Christmas of the town's biggest remaining factory. </p> <p>Other communities would be flattened by such setbacks, but in this east Midlands town they have turned the tables and flattened the colliery site. They plan to use it as an energy-efficient, environmentally-sustainable village. Coal will be a taboo word. </p> <p>It's a bold bid for economic survival in a town of 11,000 with an unemployment rate of just over 5%. The first stage - reclaiming the land, at a cost of \u00a34m - is almost finished, but the earthmovers are silent at the moment, waiting for the last 12 families of sandpipers, a protected species, to quit their nests in a sandbank. </p> <p>But on a ridge overlooking the vast Nottinghamshire site, there is a visual display of plans so that locals can get an idea of how the 90 derelict acres will be zoned for eco-friendly housing, hi-tech industry and leisure. There will be an exhibition centre and a large park. </p> <p>The view is long term. Though the first batch of houses, probably to be self-built, will be up within a year or so, it will be anything from five to 10 years before Sherwood Energy Village, as it is already known, is complete and functioning with 400 or more jobs. And to signal the new era of energy generation, there will be a biomass power station. </p> <p>In the short term, Ollerton is concerned with the effect of closure of the Coats Viyella factory. It is one of four to go in the region as the company ends its long links as a clothing supplier to Marks &amp; Spencer. Whole families depend on the plant - all five of Sandy Houston's sisters, for instance. \"Two full-time, one part-time, two outworkers,\" he says. \"My mum's worked there for years, too. They've no idea what they'll do.\" Sandy was at Coats until last month when he quit to become a driver with a relative's taxi firm. He can hardly believe his luck in getting out. </p> <p>Quite a few women at Coats are sole breadwinners, wives of former miners, says Dennis Walker, leader of the town council. For months, there were rumours that M&amp;S's troubles would hit Ollerton, though that did not lessen the shock when the announcement came. </p> <p>The disappearance of Coats marks the end of an enduring industrial marriage of a type contracted in many coalfields over 50 years ago. Hosiery and knitwear manufacture was started specifically to give work to wives and daughters of pitmen and to provide a second income. </p> <p>Now, two generations on, Ollerton is on the cusp of change, though some older residents can hardly believe in the coming hi-tech era. They are still in mourning for mining, in the lunchtime emptiness in the vast miners' \"welfare\", where once top comedians and Tamla Motown groups used to come. Memories of the 1984-85 miners' strike - in which a man died on the Ollerton picket line - linger in endless streets of homes with uniform net curtains at the windows and concessionary coal in the fireplace. </p> <p>To glimpse the future, step into the office of Carla Jamison, manager of the energy village. It is emphatically not the case that the community has turned its back on coal, she says. On the contrary, \"coal was taken away from us\". </p> <p>What happened, she says, is that a public meeting to air concerns about the pit's future was scheduled for the very night, in March 1994, that its closure was officially announced. So the discussion changed from \"What if...?\" to \"What now?\" The community held strongly that the area should not be allowed to decline, with production ending at four of five local mines. \"People wanted to build a sustainable future,\" Jamison says. \"They said we've got to fight to replace the jobs lost and create a diverse economic base.\" They were adamant on one other point: \"No more muck.\" Muck had become a dirty word. Recently, local groups have pitched in with specific ideas for their presence in the energy village: the scouts would like to erect a solar-design hut; the women's centre wants to self-build a meeting place. </p> <p>Given that Ollerton miners were known for their moderation in industrial relations (though support for the breakaway Union of Democratic Mineworkers caused clashes), the plan they supported for using the land once the pit closed was startlingly radical. By 1996, they had acquired the site from the coal board for \u00a350,000 - the money borrowed from the board itself - and opted for a structure to transform it that would, while bringing in outside investors, ensure control remained in local hands. </p> <p>An industrial and provident society was set up, with all participants having just one vote, whether they held a single share or many thousands. Grants of \u00a34m enabled reclamation work to begin last January. Recycling as much as possible of the industrial debris was a key goal. </p> <p>In keeping with the masterplan, which has been drawn up on strict principles of sustainability, there must be no carbon dioxide emissions by the industrial companies that eventually come, and householders will use solar heating. In environmental terms, says Jamison, \"there'll be nothing else like it\". </p> <p>A big breakthrough will be when the first of the hoped-for sunrise firms makes a solid commitment to move in. But there have been a few setbacks. It was hoped to convert one of the grassed-over tips, which ring much of the site, into a ski run. That has been abandoned. </p> <p>Also, the most promising source of employment was a major supermarket not on the site itself, but next to it. Originally, it was to have opened about now, which would have been ideal for absorbing many of the Coats' staff. However, Walker says there have been delays with the company handling the deal. \"I understand plans have been set back till 2001,\" he says. \"I'm very disappointed with that.\" </p> <p>But he is stoical. Dramatic change comes to communities that once passed as staid, but it happens slowly. Often its preceded by rumour - as with the death of the pit and the knitwear factory. By the same token, positive events unfold gradually. </p> <p>Perhaps that is the pace that feels comfortable to communities relying on a narrow economic base. Because, for all the careful planning by the energy village team, and for all its excellent educational and missionary work about a clean future, there are still old wounds, dating from the miners' strike. </p> <p>The dispute was 15 years ago, but still seems a short time ago to some. Walker was NUM branch president for part of the strike. \"There was strong feeling,\" he recalls. \"Brother against brother, father against son. There's still a little bit of feeling about that.\" </p> <p>Walker is 70 and has been involved in the town for 35 years. He is all for the energy village, the new supermarket, a new business park. But he knows also that the days when Ollerton supplied men to work in four other nearby pits are over. Only one, Thoresby, is still operating. </p> <p>He remembers, too, that he was made redundant when the strike was over. \"We've been let down before,\" he says, \"so we're taking it all quietly.\"</p> <p> <strong>Pits and the pendulum</strong></p> <p> Almost 36,000 jobs were lost in the Nottinghamshire coalfield between 1980 and 1997 as the industry collapsed. Today, there are just four pits left: Clipstone, Harworth, Thoresby and Welbeck, which together employ some 1,900 workers. </p> <p>On top of the direct job losses, many thousands more would have gone in industries supplying and servicing the pits. And thousands more again would have gone previously, as the pit workforces systematically shrank ahead of closure. In 1974, the Ollerton mine employed 1,355 - almost twice as many as were working there at the end. </p> <p>Despite this dramatic slump in the deep-mined coal sector, Nottinghamshire recorded a net gain of 14,500 jobs in the period 1993-97. But there has been an imbalance across the county in jobs lost and jobs created. </p> <p>While new, mainly service sector employers have been attracted to the south of the county - particularly around Nottingham itself - the north has not benefited to anything like the same degree. Former mining communities have generally fared worst, with Ollerton suffering a net loss of 500 jobs in 1993-97. </p> <p>The government says it is devoting more than \u00a31bn a year to regeneration of local authority areas with coalfields. But critics point out that this extends beyond ex-mining areas and also includes money for housing and welfare-to-work schemes. </p> <p>David Brindle</p>",
  "<p>The tantalising smell of chips lingered in the air at a summer fair in Leicester but the odour could be traced to two generators, not the food stands. \"They're running on recycled chip shop oil from Wales,\" says Oliver Savage from the organisers, Environ, a local eco-charity. </p> <p>It was his idea to hold a festival run as much as possible on renewable energy. The live music stage and movie marquee were powered by wind turbines and photovoltaic panels. The only concession to conventional fuel was the bottled gas used by some of the caterers. </p> <p>Savage says: \"Ten years ago we would not have been able to do this, not because people were not interested but because the means did not exist.\" </p> <p>The festival marked Leicester's 10th anniversary as an Environment City, an award by the Royal Society for Nature Conservation in recognition of the city's commitment to sustainable development and as a challenge to further action. </p> <p>Has Leicester risen to this challenge or is it \"all hype and very little action\" as local Friends of the Earth member Roger Jones believes? </p> <p>One flagship scheme is the bike park with city centre parking, showers, repair facility and shop. More than 300 cyclists a week use the park, run by businessman Alex Webster with the support of the city council and Environ. </p> <p>The EcoHouse, Environ's environmental show home, has re-opened this year after a major re-fit at a time when many similar facilities are opening for the first time. And the council has tightened its own operations, registering with the EU's eco-management and audit scheme. </p> <p>Alistair Reid, of the environment and development department, said: \"Four or five other local authorities are on the Emas register but we are the biggest to apply it to the whole council system.\" </p> <p>This has led to significant savings in paper and water use. The council's energy consumption has dropped too - by 8.4% in 10 years. Ross Willmott, leader of the Labour-run council, said: \"We have achieved quite a lot from locating sources of air pollution to the council's use of renewable energy in its own buildings.\" </p> <p>A survey by Environ this year found that twice as many local residents considered Environment City status a benefit compared with those who considered it a PR exercise. </p> <p>But Jones is not alone in his analysis. The council conducts public opinion surveys but Nick Jukes, an independent green activist, is still angry at its rejection of a plan by residents to convert disused allotments into community gardens. </p> <p>As for transport, the city has one park-and-ride scheme and the council hopes to get government approval for four more. Real-time information bulletins on three bus routes in the area are also being provided. </p> <p>A key indicator is recycling. The authority operates a comprehensive kerbside recycling collection although its recycling rate is a mid-table 10.5%. It hopes to quadruple this, though, through a \u00a325.8m compost machine. </p> <p>But Jones said: \"The weaknesses lie in the city council's efforts. They start out with good ideas but when the novelty wears off, they move on to something else. We were going to be a showcase for others to learn from but we have been overtaken by others doing better things.\" </p> <p>He criticises the city council for its work on litter, tree-planting and park maintenance. </p> <p>Andy Brooks, of Leicestershire Transport 2000, said: \"Environment City caught people's imagination but in the past two to three years the impetus has been flagging.\" </p> <p> He is optimistic that statutory public consultation will highlight the people's concerns - and money will follow. But the attitude that \"the council should do more\" angers Savage. \"People think Environment City is about the council when it's about personal responsibility.\"</p>",
  "<p>Internet service providers and permission-based marketing agencies are up in arms about the government's decision not to regulate against unsolicited commercial email or spam, as it's more commonly known. </p> <p>The government, which was advised on its policy by the Direct Marketing Association, has effectively made a decision not to legislate on a problem that is said to be costing the internet industry and its customers more than \u00a317m a year. </p> <p>The \u00a317m figure has been calculated from the cost ISPs incur by having to deal with junk email and customer complaints as well as the incremental costs placed on home consumers when they have to spend longer online downloading email messages. </p> <p>Guy Marson, chief executive of Mailtrack, an opt-in marketing company, and a member of the Oftel Internet Forum that advised the government on its spam policy, said the government had opened up a can of worms by choosing to support an opt-out model ,which, in the online world, is tantamount to spam.</p> <p>\"The government has taken the easy option and followed the US opt-out example, a route favoured by the DMA. The problem with this is that a number of US states are already making spam illegal and we're already hearing from US marketers that this will spread to across the board in two years time,\" said Marson. </p> <p>Opt-out is when users have to untick a box asking to avoid being sent marketing messages from third parties (usually when filling in a form on a website), while opt-in is when they choose to tick the box and receive more targeted emails. </p> <p>\"The trouble with opt-out is that it gives online marketers the green light to send as many email campaigns as they like - which is 100% spam,\" continued Marson. \"The internet industry believes that opt-in is the only responsible approach but it seems the government hasn't listened to this.\"</p> <p>Other critics of spam says the government's decision demonstrates its lack of understanding about the internet and that it should have taken into account the views of the ISP community rather than those of the DMA. According to a poll of 180 UK ISPs conducted by Mailtrack, some 98% said they strongly favoured an opt-in policy </p> <p>Richard Clayton, chair of the London Internet Exchange (LINX) subcommittee combating spam, said: \"ISPs are not in the least bit happy about delivering unsolicited email to customers. Besides clogging up our mail systems, the customers never wanted it in the first place and we then have to handle their complaints. We're totally in favour of opt-in and we take firm action to ensure that spammers do not use our systems to send their junk.\"</p>",
  "<p>Lord Melchett, the executive director of environmental protest group Greenpeace, and 27 other supporters, were today cleared by a court of causing criminal damage after a field of genetically-modified maize was damaged. </p> <p>Greenpeace, which hailed the decision as a legal landmark, said that it was delighted by the verdicts returned by a jury at Norwich Crown Court following a two-week trial. </p> <p>At a trial in April, all 28 were cleared of theft as a result of the same incident, but that jury failed to reach a decision on the criminal damage charge.</p> <p>\"We're delighted by the verdict,\" said a Greenpeace spokesman. \"We always said we were acting to protect other crops and the jury clearly believed us.\"</p> <p>And speaking immediately after the verdict, Lord Melchett called on the government to end the GM farm trials \"before any further genetic pollution of the environment occurs\". </p> <p>He said: \"Greenpeace wanted to remove the GM maize in Norfolk because we believe that GM crops will inevitably contaminate the environment.<br> \"The government is currently reviewing separation distances imposed between GM crops and other similar crops - separation distances which we said were completely inadequate when we took action in July 1999.\"</p> <p>The charge arose out of a Greenpeace orchestrated attack on a field of genetically-modified maize at Lyng, Norfolk, in August last year. </p> <p>The 28 defendants admitted destroying the crop, but said that acting to prevent pollen from the genetically-modified maize from polluting neighbouring organic crops and gardens - a defence the jury sympathised with.</p> <p>Judge David Mellor ruled that the \u00a3250,000 costs for the two trials would fall to the prosecution.</p> <p>Peter Tidey, chief Crown prosecutor for Norfolk, said after the verdict: \"We felt this was a matter which should be decided by a jury and we sought a retrial so it could be resolved. There has now been a hearing and a verdict by a jury and we accept the decision of the court.\"</p> <p>The jury of seven men and five women took around five hours to reach its verdicts. There were cheers and applause from the defendants as they were read out. </p> <p>It is thought to be one of the largest groups of defendants tried in the same court in British legal history. </p> <p>There were too many defendants, 13 of whom work for Greenpeace, to fit into the dock. Other defendants, including Lord Melchett, were seated in various other parts of the court. </p> <p>Last year, the Archers Radio 4 soap opera carried a storyline which ran parallel to today's trial.</p> <p>One of the characters, Tommy Archer, was charged with criminal damage after an attack on a field of GM crops and successfully mounted the same defence.</p>",
  "<p>James Wolfensohn President World Bank 1818 H Street, NW Washington DC 20433, USA</p> <p>20 September 2000</p> <p>Dear Mr Wolfensohn,</p> <p>The Bank, under your direction, is developing a major new internet initiative which aims to become \"the premier web entry point for information about poverty and sustainable development\". To achieve this it would need to include all shades of opinion and be a broad, multi-stakeholder initiative, including civil society. Many civil society groups, including many of the undersigned, have held discussions with the Bank and among themselves about the Gateway.</p> <p>We are writing to inform you that many of the major issues we have raised have not been addressed. It seems, especially from the report \"Global Development Gateway Issues Identified During Consultations\" recently produced by the Bank's Gateway team, that you and the Bank's Board may have been misinformed about the extent and nature of civil society concerns and our disappointment in the Bank's response.</p> <p>These concerns are serious both in relation to the opportunities missed by the Gateway, and because they have the potential to confuse potential funders, people asked to be Topic Guides, site visitors, and many others. It is not the case, as hinted in the above report of the consultations, that these views are only held by opponents of the World Bank or groups based in Europe. In fact a wide range of NGOs, academics and also officials are extremely sceptical about the initiative.</p> <p>Among the key problems identified with the Bank's Gateway plans are:</p> <p>1) insufficient independence of Gateway governance. The Gateway's global and national governance structures do not adequately protect civil society interests. Whilst an independent foundation has been established, the constitution of the Board and Advisory Committee do not give grounds for confidence that the Gateway will be truly independent of the Bank, national governments and big business. Particular concerns are the role of the Bank in making appointments relating to the Global Gateway, governments' leading roles in Country Gateways and companies' ability to buy Gateway Board membership (and \"co-branding\" opportunities) with annual payments of a million dollars. Creating a nominally independent entity has thus not solved the acute accountability issues around the Gateway, issues which are very sensitive in portal development, essentially an editorial activity similar to publishing newspapers.</p> <p>2) alternative design options rejected. Very early in discussions about the Gateway a number of civil society groups suggested an alternative design approach which would use the latest spidering software to allow distributed, user-driven topic aggregation. This would overcome the difficulties of the chosen Gateway design which gives power and impossible judgements to individual editors, and empower groups across the world to post and group information according to their needs. Yet the Gateway still favours a vertical, edited approach which will cause many problems of credibility and useability.</p> <p>3) communication/consultation insufficient. Whilst there have been a number of consultation exercises, it appears that the Bank has overemphasised the production of pilot sites and fundraising rather than communicating with diverse audiences about the GDG's intentions and what might best meet their needs. Many important groups still know nothing about the Gateway and many who do have tabled questions which have not been answered.</p> <p>4) overambition and unfair competition; The Gateway, whilst based on good intentions to increase coordination of web activity, is too ambitious and cannot meet all of its goals. At the same time its huge budget (60 million dollars over three years) and marketing reach are likely to have huge opportunity costs for the many existing and planned portal ventures in this area. It is not appropriate for the heavily subsidized Gateway to compete with these (for profit and non-profit) initiatives, including in many of the \"pilot\" countries.

  "Buoyed by their best opinion poll result for five years, Liberal Democrat leaders yesterday predicted they would win more seats than their current 47 at the coming general election, and could even double their numbers at the expense of Labour and the Conservatives. <p>Charles Kennedy has been cautious about the advice of Lord Rennard, his polling pundit, who noted that 50 southern Tory seats have majorities smaller than the one which fell to the Lib Dems at the Romsey byelection this spring. </p> <p>But this week's Guardian/ICM opinion poll gave Mr Kennedy's troops 22% - one point more than NOP's 21% in the Sunday Times - as angry voters defected from Labour but gave William Hague only half the swing votes. </p> <p>At the party conference yesterday the mood was much more upbeat. Mr Kennedy blamed Labour's collapse on \"institutional arrogance\" while his campaigns chief, Lord Razzell, told delegates: \"Order the champagne for the day after the election. We will be celebrating winning more seats and more votes than in 1997. </p> <p>\"The evidence is there. I am not just talking about the opinion polls - no, I am talking about the hard evidence of real votes cast by real people in real elections,\" said Lord Razzell, who reminded the 50 Tory MPs vulnerable post-Romsey: \"Watch out, Liberal Democrats are after you.\" </p> <p>He promised delegates that the Lib Dem campaign - \"honest, confident, positive\" - would never compromise, as Labour had, on issues such as pensions, Europe, race, public services or the environment. </p> <p>Last night's party political broadcast showed Mr Kennedy making similar claims while warning that, though Labour had proved better for the NHS and education than the Tories, Mr Blair had \"wasted three years\" following Tory tax plans. \"You need to watch Labour like a hawk, they are forever claiming to be spending more money than they have,\" he said. </p> <p>Lib Dems analysts say they have some basis for hoping to hold their seats and make even modest gains in the coming election, because there are signs that sitting MPs benefit from first-time incumbency when defending their patch. </p> <p>If Mr Hague can get his core vote out and gain some centre ground Mr Kennedy's hopes could go pear-shaped. But Lord Razzell summed up the optimism in Bournemouth when he said: \"Labour a disappointment; Tories a disaster. So you can tell people how Liberal Democrats can make the difference.\"</p>",
  "<b> Good day</b> <br> <p>For everyone at the Royal Bournemouth hospital, where Charles Kennedy was half an hour late for an official visit. Happily for the politician-weary staff and patients the late-running leader had to shorten his tour to keep to his timetable. </p> <p> </p> <p><b> Bad day</b><br> </p> <p>For Jack Straw and Ann Widdecombe. Simon Hughes challenged his Labour and Tory opposite numbers to a Big Brother contest. He predicted that in a national phonepoll - in the style of the Channel 4 show - he would trounce \"big brother Jack\" and \"big sister Ann\". \"Conference, just imagine how many votes Mr Straw and Miss Widdecombe would get if they were up for eviction,\" he told delegates. </p> <p> </p> <p><b> Quote of the day</b><br> </p> <p> The TUC general secretary John Monks said: \"Britain's unions can claim to be Labour's parents, although a DNA test might show that other genes somehow got into the conception.\" </p> <p> </p> <p><b> Delegate of the day</b><br> </p> <p> Elizabeth Barraclough, 67, a retired director of computing services at the University of Newcastle, from Workington. </p> <p>\"This is my seventh conference on the run and it's a good one. The high spot was Simon Hughes speaking because he's just such good value. </p> <p>I gave John Monks a standing ovation, along with everyone else, first because he is the first TUC general secretary to come to the conference and second because he believes we should embrace the euro and I'm all for that.\" </p> <p> </p> <p><b> Today</b><br> </p> <p> Speech by Alan Beith, the party's deputy leader; social security spokesman Steve Webb will present Age of Opportunity, a policy paper on pensions; Don Foster, spokesman on environment and the regions, will introduce his No 2, Tom Brake MP, to lead a debate on Strategy for Sustainability.</p>",
  "As an old Labour supporter and therefore not enamoured of many aspects of this government's policies, I am bound, even so, to question some of the extraordinary propaganda which has been made stick to New Labour over the last three years and stick again during the fuel blockade. <p>One of the greatest propagandist triumphs of the right since 1997 has been the establishment on the political agenda, via the media, of the highly pejorative concept of \"spin doctoring\" attributed to this government as if, unlike the Tories, it was the first to discover the primary importance of presentation for launching its policies. New Labour \"spin\" is a (failed) attempt to counteract the distortions, omissions and downright lies relating to issues of major importance by the politically hostile and wholly dominant right-of-centre press in Britain. </p> <p>But the scalp of the so-called \"spin doctor\" is only one of many that the right has notched up over recent years; others include teaching, Europe, the environment, crime and taxation (most recently fuel tax). On all these and other issues, the level and quality of public debate generated by the papers of the right have been risible, misleading and often both. The public have been frequently misled on these crucial issues and disempowered in consequence. If the government is out of touch with the people, as is now being claimed, it should be recognised that the people are also out of touch with government and that this separation is due largely to the spin of the political right and the massive support given to it by its papers. </p> <p>Whether we call it spin or something else, the government will have to find ways of getting important issues and policy objectives to the public without them being trashed by the dominant rightwing press. A long-term solution may be a radical reform of the Press Complaints Commission aimed at getting more informative and balanced reporting from the papers. In the short term, somewhat despairingly, I leave you this thought: if Hague and his shadow ministers \"look less fit to govern than just about any other in Britain's history\" (Guardian leader, September 19), how, if not by media \"makeover\" of himself and the issues, does he have a four point lead in the polls? <br><b>Tony Weymouth </b><br> Burton-in-Kendal, Cumbria <br><a href=\"mailto:AWeymo@aol.com\">AWeymo@aol.com</a> </p> <p> </p> <p>\u0095 The only conclusions that can be drawn from your poll showing Labour four points behind the Conservatives (Labour slump puts Tories ahead, September 19) are that either the wrong question was asked or that the British public have the collective political intelligence of a geranium. There is no revelation in the fact that people don't like high fuel taxes. Without a poll I would risk the claim that people are also against the taxes on beer and tobacco and believe that income taxes are too high. </p> <p>Most people would oppose price supports for farmers and already-existing tax concessions for hauliers - if the facts were presented to them. The same people support more spending for education and the NHS and higher state pensions. </p> <p>This government, like all democratic governments, has to balance revenues, taxes and expenditures in a responsible way. To hit out at one sort of tax without explaining what one is willing to give up to balance lower revenues is stupid and irresponsible. </p> <p>We have a Tory leader whose sole announced policy seems to be to blame all the nation's woes on high taxes, the rest of Europe and immigrants - not necessarily in that order. To switch one's allegiance to such an alternative because a handful of farmers and lorry drivers managed to paralyse the country over high fuel taxes is simply idiotic. <br><b> Stanley Grossman </b><br> London <br><a href=\"mailto:SIG@pressit.com\">SIG@pressit.com</a> </p> <p> </p> <p>\u0095 If the government is now less popular than the Tories, thanks to the fuel tax, how come it was really popular two weeks ago, when the fuel tax was just the same?

  "\u0095 Ken Livingstone has been rather quiet since his election triumph. But behind the scenes big issues are being dealt with - and few literally come bigger than who presides over the switching on of lights on the famous Christmas tree in Trafalgar Square. The tree (donated by a grateful Norway for Britain's efforts in the second world war) has traditionally been lit by the mayor of Oslo, with the Lord Mayor of Westminster in attendance. But in October responsibility for Trafalgar Square passes from the Department of Culture, Media and Sport to the mayor of London's office, and Ken wanted a cut of the tree action. \"The Lord Mayor can go to Norway and watch the thing being cut down if he wants, but Ken's going to switch it on. He is the mayor of London,\" one of Ken's aides was heard to say. Top-level talks last week between Westminster's lord mayor Michael Brahams and Ken led to a compromise, with the DCMS organising this year's festivities for one last time. \"Ken is going to be there as well,\" says press officer Helen Hall-Wright. <br> \u0095 We can sleep easier now the government is dealing with the threat of the earth being destroyed by asteroids. But what is being done about killer robots and giant mutant lizards? We rang the Number 10 press office to demand action on the robot-lizard threat, only to be fobbed off to the Cabinet Office. \"Oh, this came up yesterday,\" said a press officer, who suggested we try the DTI. \"Good God, I've got no idea,\" said Mark Haliford, the DTI's press officer for potentially hazardous near earth export commodities, \"I'm trying to think, is this really a matter for the department?\" Of course it is, Mark. \"Is there any evidence of these lizards, I mean asteroids, have actually hit the earth?\" Mark asks. That petty empirical view won't help, Mark.   \u0095 At least one transport company bucked the trend and froze its prices this year, in spite of \"above average increases in fuel tax\". It's the Government Car and Despatch Agency, which provides \"a high quality, secure environment in which ministers and others in public life can travel safely and in comfort, allowing them to concentrate on their work.\"  \u0095 Michela Wrong's new book In the Footsteps of Mr Kurtz (Fourth Estate, \u00a314) recounts some extraordinary tales of excess by Zaire's President Mobutu, funded in the main by the IMF and the World Bank. In his later years Mobutu retreated to a Xanadu-style folie de grandeur, complete with orange groves, musical fountains and imported Swiss cattle. But for visiting dignitaries, forced to travel 700 miles from Kinshasa, the worst part was being taken for a drive in the presidential Chevrolet. One US official found himself clinging on for his life as Mobutu careered along. \"It was like a cartoon, people and things were leaping out of the way,\" said the official. When his guests made mild remonstrations, the dictator replied: \"It's OK, these are all my roads.\"   \u0095 I'm grateful to my so-called rivals at The Register website for the charming tale of David Watkins, who wrote to BT complaining about poor service. BT replied: \"Dear Mr Watkins, I sincerely apologise for any incontinence caused over the last few weeks.\"  \u0095 This is, I am told, a true story, and since it was told to me by a man in a pub who read it on an email, who could doubt it? It involves a businessman waiting to meet a client in an airport VIP lounge. He spots Bill Gates sitting alone, and introduces himself. \"Could I ask a small favour?\" he says to Gates. \"I'm waiting for someone and when he arrives I'd be grateful if you could walk by, tap me on the shoulder and say hello.\" Bill graciously agrees, and when the client arrives, Bill taps the first man on the shoulder and says \"Hi!\" The man turns around and snarls: \"F*** off Gates, can't you see I'm busy!\" <a href=\"mailto:diary@theguardian.com\">diary@theguardian.com</a>",
  "<p>With global equity markets continuing to fret about the impact of the high oil price it was no surprise to see defensive favourites such as water utilities and food retailers perform well yesterday. </p> <p>But that only told half the story. In the main <strong>Tesco</strong>, up 18.25p, or 8.43%, to 234.75p, was responding to another set of flawless figures, while talk that German utilities group RWE is on the prowl sent the share prices in the water sector sharply higher. </p> <p><strong>Thames Water</strong> rose 48.5p to 915p, the best performer in the FTSE 250, <strong> Severn Trent Water</strong> put on 23.5p to 677p, <strong>Anglian Water</strong> advanced 18p to 528p and <strong> Kelda Group</strong> rose 11.5p to 350p. </p> <p>According to traders the speculative money was on a bid by RWE for Thames Water, by common consent the sector's blue chip play. \"It's a credible story. If someone wanted to take on Vivendi and Suez they would snap up Thames because of the international spread of its operations,\" one sector specialist said. </p> <p>That plus comments attributed at the weekend to the new industry regulator, Philip Fletcher, indicating he was open to ideas about restructuring in the sector, got punters very excited. </p> <p>\"The sector is very cheap at the moment on fundamentals. Restructuring is inevitable and we expect management to look at creative ways to unlock value,\" UBS utilities analyst Simon Hawkins said. </p> <p>Dealers also noted that the sector was belatedly reacting to comments made by the competition commission at the end of last week, which appeared to support the argument that price cuts imposed by industry regulator Ofwat on the industry had been too harsh. </p> <p>The commission argued that the price cuts imposed on Mid Kent Water and East Surrey Water by Ofwat were over the top. In particular, it took issue with Ofwat's treatment of depreciation and the cost of capital, both of which are crucial because they determine the level of returns utilities can make for their shareholders. </p> <p>It concluded that both companies should be allowed a high rate of return, a precedent that could have important ramifications for the sector. Some analysts expect other water companies to follow the lead of Mid Kent and East Surrey and demand the regulator takes a fresh look at the price cuts. </p> <p>Meanwhile, leading shares made it 10 down days in the last 11 trading sessions, as the oil price continued to stoke fears that the global economy is heading for a hard landing. </p> <p>At the close the blue chip index was down 6.7 points at 6,403.5, with \"old economy\" stocks undermined by a string of profit warnings from US peers and concerns about the effect the oil price is having on raw material costs. </p> <p>Just when <strong>Invensys</strong> share holders thought things could not get worse, they did. </p> <p>Shares in the automation and controls firm slipped 7p to 144p, unsettled by a nasty profit warning from US rival Rockwell. </p> <p>Shares in chemicals outfit <strong>ICI</strong>, which slipped to a 10-year low on Monday, sank further into the mire, by 26p to 384p, as investors continued to fret about the impact of the strong oil price and the weak euro. However, dealers dismissed talk that ICI is close to issuing a profit warning. </p> <p>Shares in the mining group <strong>Billiton</strong> dropped 12.5p to 264p as a profit warning from the US group Alcoa soured sentiment toward the entire sector. </p> <p>Lower down the corporate scale, things were not much better. The FTSE 250 ended down 95.8 points at 6,806, with the conglomerate <strong>Tomkins</strong> falling 18.5p to 172p. Analysts are concerned about the performance of industrial components which are predominantly focused on North America. </p> <p>Sugar company <strong>Tate &amp; Lyle </strong> fell 21.75p to 225.5p as punters finally reacted to a profit warning from US sweetener group Corn Products International.</p>",
  "<p>Paul Wright and Val Kaye's attempt to set up a home-shopping channel was the subject of <strong> Telly Sales</strong> (Channel 4), a rather jolly documentary which showed that the public gets what it deserves. The public - or at least, the public who watch home-shopping channels - don't like the hustle and bustle of ordinary shopping. They visit the Ideal Homes Exhibition to see the \"stars\" of QVC, ogling them with an adoration normally reserved for pop stars and David Jason, and showering them with compliments like \"she is the personification of elegance\" despite it being blatantly untrue. Thus, this public gets imitation diamonds, home hair-removal kits and toilet-seat warmers, paid for in two easy payments and all without the hassle of leaving the house. While it's probably for the best that these people stay indoors and off the streets, rather worryingly they flex substantial financial muscle. In the UK alone, the home-shopping industry has a turnover of \u00a3250 million. </p> <p>Understandably then, Paul and Val wanted Ideal to take on the home-shopping giant QVC. But as Paul himself admitted, if the granddaddy of home shopping knew how disorganised his channel was, \"they would be laughing into their socks\". Or, more likely, into their sheepskin-effect cosyboots with a choice of three tartan covers. </p> <p>With little time to build a studio, even less to train gormless presenters - or find ones with gorm pre-removed - and the media showing little interest in their exciting new venture (emphatically their words), tempers were fraying. The trophies of the presenting team - Debbie Flint, formerly a presenter on British Forces television, Paul Lavers, runner-up in last year's cable TV personality of the year, and Steve Whatley, the gadget man from This Morning - were, in their own individual ways, quite repellent. One can only assume Lavers, who looked as if he was sculpted by Gerry Anderson and operated by Lily Savage, lost out in the personality of the year contest to some effervescent individual. Perhaps that man from the Claims Direct advert who received \u00a313,000 after suffering an accident at work. In between queeny fits, hilarious incompetence all round and praying for death threats (though, oddly, not on each other), Ideal went on air on time (\"Live from Peterborough!\") And people phoned in. And ordered things. It almost beggars belief. </p> <p>When Strindberg described the family as \"home of all social evils, a charitable institution for indolent women, a prison workshop for the slaving breadwinner and a hell for children\", he hadn't even seen <strong> My Family</strong> (BBC1). If he had, he would have added \"and not an institution easily made amusing, even if you have a team of writers in an American style\". Robert Lindsay and Zo\u00eb Wanamaker lead the cast, all of whom were sleepwalking through their parts, thanks to the absolute dearth of interesting plot and pedestrian characters. </p> <p> <strong> Love Is Not Enough: The Journey To Adoption</strong> (BBC1) was a sensitive and honest look at \"the ultimate job interview that natural parents never need endure\". Three quite different couples, with a more positive view of families than Strindberg, were being assessed as potential adoptive parents, with each set of circumstances illuminating the process of adoption as a whole. It made for moving television. </p> <p>Linda and Tony from Leeds were worried that the bedroom they had set aside for a prospective child might be considered too small; Paula and Al left the decisions in God's hands; while Mark and Sarah were adopting a \"special needs\" child from China. While the couples are to be applauded for their openness - and like it or not, Mark and Sarah's discussion of what level of disability they would accept is one most of us would have - Sarah's reason for adopting again sounded a bit odd, if not selfish. \"If we lost him [Joshua], the cost would be so high emotionally, you kind of feel you want a second child as an insurance policy\", she explained. Second child as insurance policy. How heart-warming. </p> <p> <strong> A Very British Murder: Killing Christine</strong> (Channel 4) told of another family, albeit one torn apart by murder. Speaking of their mother's murder, her prostitution and her murderers, Denise and Damon Alford were dignified and honest, children of whom their mother would be rightly proud. A testament to the indomitability of the human spirit and a tribute to their mother's love.</p>",
  "<p>Dixons, Britain's largest electrical retailer, is creating 1,000 jobs at its expanded call centre in Sheffield. </p> <p>The recruitment drive follows the firm's decision to centralise all customer services in Yorkshire. </p> <p>Its announcement yesterday is the second phase of a \u00a345m project which has already seen 650 staff taken on. The investment will be a tonic for Sheffield, which has reinvented itself since the days when most of its population was employed in the steelworks. </p> <p>Tony Ackroyd, Dixons Group contact centres director, said the centre was on the 11-acre Nunnery Square site. \"The first phase created 650 new jobs and invested almost \u00a330m in the local economy. When phase two is fully operational we expect to have created up to 2,000 jobs with a total investment of around \u00a345m.\" </p> <p>A spokesman for Dixons said the centre would eventually receive all inquiries - including advice on setting up machinery and ordering spare parts - which were previously dealt with at the head office in Hemel Hempstead. </p> <p>\"Customers of electrical retailers tend to want a lot of after-sales service,\" he said. \"We wanted to centralise all our customer contact activities.\" </p> <p>The call centre industry has been one of the success stories of the past five years, despite some debate about the career prospects and security of tenure they offer. </p> <p>Most retailers, manufacturers and financial service companies have either established their own centres or contracted out the operation to independent operators. </p> <p>South Yorkshire, whose economy has suffered dramatically from the decline of steel and coal, is a favoured location because costs are relatively low and labour is plentiful. </p> <p>Earlier this month Dixons announced sales for the 18 weeks to September 2 were 29% ahead of the same period last year and 5% up on a like-for-like basis.</p>",
  "\"When you are really rich, people come to you,\" Gilbert de Botton once said to Lucian Freud.

Yet he began his career as a penniless Sephardic Jew in the conservative banking environment of Zurich, with no family or connections, isolated and lonely. <p>Born in Alexandria, he attended the Hebrew University of Jerusalem before taking an MA at Columbia University, New York. In 1960, he joined the Zilkha family's investment vehicle, Ufltec, in Zurich. In 1968, he was introduced to Jacob (now Lord) Rothschild, at a time when the family was opening a new bank in Switzerland, Rothschild Bank AG. They started with a tiny office and the \"genius\" - as Gilbert had been described - and business grew exponentially. He moved briefly to New York to take care of the Rothschild interests there until 1983, when he decided to go it alone. </p> <p>Gilbert moved to London, founded Global Asset Management (GAM), of which he owned 60% and Jacob Rothschild 40%, and set about changing the way the money of the really wealthy was invested: no longer a safe split between equities and bonds handled in-house by the relevant departments of the firm, but a global and imaginative delegation to the truly knowledgeable. </p> <p>Gilbert searched the world for expert in each investment area, be it Japanese bonds, American stocks or European currencies. He spread his increasingly large portfolio of assets under management among them, according to his assessment of the risk involved in each area; he started with \u00a3lm and ended with more than \u00a310bn. It was a brilliant strategy, and it resulted in GAM being sold in 1999 to UBS for more than \u00a3420m, an extraordinary price for a company whose assets were mostly know-how, contacts and credibility. </p> <p>In those characteristics, the firm reflected its boss. Gilbert was a brilliant man, with the intellectual power to absorb, analyse and understand a mind-boggling amount of information. He was also cultured, suave, witty, modest and authoritative - an impossible combination to resist when first meeting him. </p> <p>A new client would be invited for lunch in GAM's elegant St James's office, served with delicious, but very light, food and, as the butler took the coffee cups, Gilbert would nonchalantly say: \"Let's see how the markets are doing today\", while opening a concealed drawer in the table. </p> <p>A Bond film scene would ensue: shutters would close, blinds come down, the 18th century mirror would come to light with a back-projected screen showing, in vivid colours, the day's activities or, better still, GAM's impressive track record. The client was hooked. Credibility came from Gilbert's total reliability, and his obsessive attention to confidentiality. </p> <p> Gilbert was also a world expert on the 16th-century French thinker Michel de Montaigne, and had amassed an immense library devoted to his work. Though sometimes aloof - Francis Bacon said to Lucian Freud that Gilbert reminded him of an ancient Egyptian - and often short-tempered with those closest to him, he managed, on the whole, to appear always smiling and courteous and, particularly in recent years, seemed to start relaxing in the happiness that his second wife, Janet Wolfson, brought him. </p> <p>Both loved art, if not perhaps the same art. Gilbert recognised early the greatness of Picasso's late paintings, and collected the best of them. He bought Freud before it was fashionable, and the painter introduced him to Francis Bacon: both made portraits of Gilbert. Freud worked for a long time on a large canvas, and, realising months later that the picture did not work, started again on a smaller canvas - without the slightest protest from his busy sitter. </p> <p>Gilbert was also a great benefactor of the Tate Gallery, a trustee (1985-92), the first chairman of both the Tate Gallery Foundation and of the museum's international council. A major gallery of the fifth floor of Tate Modern is named after him. </p> <p>Ultimately, he was a great intellectual, a scholar who enjoyed applying purity of thought to everything he did, as if to follow in the tradition of a family steeped in learning since the 16th century. His articles on Montaigne, or the world economy, were as subtle as they were learned and sophisticated in construction, and he was immensely proud that his son Alain had become a famous writer. A short and wiry man, he will be remembered by his many friends for his good heart and captivating smile. </p> <p>He is survived by his wife, and two children from his earlier marriage to Jacqueline Burgauer. </p> <p>\u0095 Gilbert de Botton, banker and art benefactor, born February 16 1935; died August 27 2000</p>",
  "Shelagh Fraser, who has died aged 79, was a versatile and distinctive actress, whose work was informed by a glint of insightful humour. She enjoyed a 60-year career in the London theatre, a leading role in the 1969 television saga, A Family At War, and a character part in the 1977 film blockbuster, Star Wars. <p>She had established herself on the West End stage by the mid-1940s, after making her debut at the Comedy Theatre in 1944, as Effie in This Was A Woman. After Rattigan's While The Sun Shines (1945), playing the irrepressible good-time girl, Mabel Crumm, there followed a succession of leading roles, including Hetty, in Call Home The Heart (1947), and the formidably strait-laced Lady Orreyd, in HM Tennent's lavish 1950 revival of Pinero's society drama, The Second Mrs Tanqueray, about the dire consequences which could follow from a Victorian misalliance. It was a performance widely noticed for its aristocratic poise and sharp cutting edge. </p> <p>National fame came in 1969, when Fraser was cast as Jean Ashton, the embattled matriarch of Granada Television's A Family At War, in which an ordinary northern family faced the perils and sacrifices of life in wartime Liverpool. She appeared in 45 of the serial's 52 episodes. </p> <p>Eight years later, she was cast by George Lucas as Luke Skywalker's Aunt Beru in Star Wars. Although this was only a small character role, the fact that she had played a part in the most successful cinema attraction of its time resulted in an avalanche of global fan-mail - and her own internet website. </p> <p>Fraser made a careful choice of her stage roles. In 1953, at the Arts Theatre, she played Cristine in a revival of Lennox Robinson's Drama At Inish, a delicate tragi-comedy of theatrical life in Northern Ireland, and, in the 1960s and 70s, she continued to appear in a range of plays by such notable dramatists as Harold Pinter (Flora, in A Slight Ache), Alan Ayckbourn (Delia, in A Bedroom Farce), Tennessee Williams and Edward Albee. In 1967, she gave a virulent and anguished account of Martha, in Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf, and, in 1973, a poignant study of Amanda Wingfield, the fluttery, clinging mother-figure in The Glass Menagerie. </p> <p>Her last major stage appearance was in 1974, in David Hare's Knuckle, at the Royal Court, where her Mrs Dinning made a marked contribution to the play's edgy and disturbing effect. </p> <p>Her television and film work was lively and varied, with two vivid flourishes marking her last appearances - as the demented old bag-lady who haunted the bar in the BBC version of Rodney Ackland's Absolute Hell, and as the paralysed, but wickedly communicative, stroke victim in Edith's Finger, which won the Welsh Bafta award for best short film in 1999. </p> <p>Fraser's family was part of the City dynasty of jewellers Mappin and Webb. Her father was sent to Australia to found an outpost of the business, and, on his return to England, it was discovered that his daughter had contracted spinal tuberculosis, which, as a child, condemned her to lying flat in a specially elongated invalid carriage. She faced this adversity with courage, did well at St Christopher's school, Kingswood, and won a scholarship to a nearby drama school, attached to Croydon repertory theatre. Here, she made her first stage appearance, in 1938. </p> <p>With her naturally inquiring mind, it was never likely that Fraser would be content to work simply as an actress. In the 1970s, by then in her 50s, she wrote two successful children's books, Captain Johnny and Princess Tai Lue, the tale of an exotic cat. But, as early as 1950, she had tried her hand as a playwright, collaborating on Always Afternoon, a languorous evocation of lotus-eating expatriates on the French riviera, which ran briefly at the Garrick Theatre. </p> <p>In the 1980s, she became fascinated by the challenges of radio drama. As an actress, she had appeared in more than 500 radio plays, and, for a time, been a member of the BBC Repertory Company. Now, as a dramatist, she adapted Rose Macauley's The World My Wilderness and Rebecca West's The Salt Of The Earth for Radio 4. Her other play for radio was an original, The Maid's Room, a fascinating study of a servant-mistress relationship. </p> <p>Fraser remained a strikingly pretty woman, whose appearance was marked with a characteristic expression in which humour and tenderness were equally mixed, and which reflected her warm and constant gift for friendship. </p> <p>\u0095 Shelagh Fraser, actress and writer, born November 25 1920; died August 29 2000</p>",
  "Renewing their attack on the government, senior Tories today pledged that the next Conservative administration will cut fuel tax by 3p per litre, or 13.6p per gallon. <p>This would save a family with a Ford Mondeo \u00a31.85 every time they filled the tank, shadow chancellor Michael Portillo told a press conference at Conservative central office.</p> <p>He insisted that these reductions were sustainable, accusing the chancellor of hoarding \u00a35bn in surplus revenues. \"Everybody knows that Gordon Brown has a war chest,\" he said. Implementing the changes immediately would cost \u00a3525m this year.</p> <p>The proposed cuts, costing \u00a31.1bn annually, could easily be met, he said. \"We have identified reductions in public spending well in excess of that number.\"</p> <p>He concluded: \"The reduction we propose is prudent, achievable and modest.\"</p> <p>Mr Portillo was speaking after an introductory address by Conservative leader William Hague in which he pilloried government profligacy, lies and arrogance. </p> <p>\"It's now beyond dispute that this Labour government wastes vast sums of money and we have the scandal of the Millennium Dome as a monument to that.,\" he said.</p> <p>\"It is now beyond dispute that this Labour government does not tell the truth - and we now have the chancellor's lies over Formula One as proof of that. And it is now beyond dispute that this Labour government does not listen.</p> <p>\"Tens of millions of people want the government to listen over fuel taxes. It is because they won't listen that those people have come to view this prime minister as arrogant and out of touch.\"</p> <p>He criticised both the real-term rise in fuel taxation suggested by the Liberal Democrats and the strategy of \"stealth taxation\" adopted by the Labour party.</p> <p>\"Tony Blair is still more interested in blaming everyone else for what happened last week. Instead, he should say sorry for his stealth taxes\u0083 Incredibly, Tony Blair still thinks spin is the only answer,\" Mr Hague said.</p> <p>Referring again to the controversy over Bernie Ecclestone's \u00a31m donation to Labour, he described current fiscal policy as \"the devious tax-raising methods of a devious chancellor.\"</p> <p>While insisting that the petrol and diesel tax cuts were \"modest and achievable\", he stressed it was not the limit of what a future Conservative government might cut off fuel duty.</p> <p>Social Security secretary Alistair Darling described Mr Portillo's announcement as \"opportunistic\" and a \"return to the worst of Tory boom and bust\". \"Michael Portillo was Treasury Chief Secretary when the Tories broke their promises on tax 22 times. This is the man who personally argued for many of these tax rises.\"</p> <p>He added: \"Rather than William Hague attempting to jump on any passing bandwagon it is time the Tories came clean with the British people and admitted which schools and which hospitals they will cut. The Tories may be serious opportunists but they are not a serious Opposition.\"</p> <p>Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy also dismissed the promises. \"I don't think that the country will take seriously what William Hague's Conservative party has got to say about tax on this or anything else.\" </p> <p>Speaking at the annual party conference in Bournemouth, he said: \"They seem to be promising reductions in tax on every available issue and increases in spending on all the right things. Real life isn't like that.\"</p> <p>Liberal Democrat environment spokesman Don Foster said: \"With the billions they are promising to cut out of the income coming into the Exchequer, they have now got to explain how they are going to fund the quality services the British people want, not least investment in public transport.\"</p> <p>Europe's transport minister's are due to meet in Luxembourg later today to discuss the ongoing fuel crisis. Loyola de Palacio, EC commissioner for transport and energy, has warned that EU governments will play into the hands of the oil producers if they compensated for higher basic costs by easing tax. \"Member states must resist the temptation, amid demands from certain sectors of the economy, to reduce taxes,\" she said this morning.</p>",
  "<p>Two of the world's leading financial institutions clashed yesterday over the potential impact on economic growth of the soaring oil price. </p> <p>The International Monetary Fund, publishing its twice-yearly World Economic Outlook at the start of its annual meeting in Prague, predicted that world output would expand by 4.7% this year. </p> <p>This rate is some 0.5% higher than it forecast in May, but the IMF warned that the spiralling oil price was clouding its generally upbeat outlook. </p> <p>Michael Mussa, the IMF's chief economist, said the cost of crude could reduce growth to 3.75% next year from the fund's central projection of 4.25%, even if the oil price fell gradually from now onwards. </p> <p>\"If oil prices were to stay at $35 a barrel throughout 2001, or if they were to escalate to $40 a barrel or over, then the impact on inflation and world growth would be more significant,\" he said. </p> <p>Mussa said oil prices, which have risen by more than $6 since the IMF completed its economic forecasts in August, would add some $200bn to the world's annual energy bill. </p> <p>His concern was echoed by US energy secretary Bill Richardson, who said an oil price of $38 a barrel was \"dangerously high\" and the White House would not hesitate to use all options to fight soaring energy costs. But the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, Unctad, shrugged off higher energy costs as a \"blip\" which would unwind without causing much damage. </p> <p>Dr Yilmaz Akyuz, head of Unctad's macroeconomic and development policies, said governments in the developed world, including Britain, could afford to sit back and wait for the oil price to subside, although he added that they might want to cut petrol taxes to preserve social stability. </p> <p>Lower fuel duties would have the beneficial side-effect of dampening down inflation, he said. \"I believe [the higher oil price] is a temporary shock. Opec does not want prices that will encourage alternative sources of energy,\" he said. </p> <p>As if to underline the differences between the IMF and the UN, the pair disagreed on the recovery of nations from currency crises. The IMF said Asia and Latin America had recovered well from the world economic crisis of 1997-99. </p> <p>However, Unctad's annual trade and development report said the structural weaknesses that prompted fears of recession in the wake of the Asian financial crisis still existed, and were being made worse by the actions of international economic policymakers. </p> <p>The IMF was troubled by the Mexican economy, which it warned was close to overheating. It also predicted that Russia's economy would grow by 4% next year - its third successive year of growth after almost a decade of decline. </p> <p>But Russia, the IMF's largest single borrower, still needs to step up the pace of economic reform, revising bankruptcy laws, curbing barter trade and cracking down on arrears. </p> <p>The UN believes the US could prove the greater problem. Dr Akyuz said that while the persistent and unexpected strength of the American economy had helped avert a global recession last year, the huge trade deficit incurred and the unsustainably strong dollar represented a renewed threat to global stability. </p> <p>While it was possible the American economy may follow the IMF's \"goldilocks\" scenario, and slow down to a rate of growth that was neither too hot nor too cold, that would require a lot of luck, he said. </p> <p><strong>UK</strong> </p> <p>IMF forecasts healthy growth of 3.1% this year, with a slight slowing next to 2.8%. Worried that sterling could slide, the <strong> Bank of England</strong> may still need to raise interest rates to keep inflationary pressures under control. The IMF is concerned that Gordon Brown's planned boost to public spending will come at the wrong point in the business cycle, with the economy already expanding at close to its potential limits </p> <p><strong>Europe</strong> </p> <p>Weak euro buoys exports; growth in the euro zone is expected to rise to 3.5% this year and 3.4% in 2001. The IMF says the growth rate of the11 zone members next year will be faster than the US's for the first time since the currency's launch; there are worries that <strong> Ireland</strong> and the <strong> Netherlands</strong> are overheating and calls in those countries for extra government revenues to be banked, rather than spent </p> <p><strong> United States</strong> </p> <p>Record growth but roaring domestic demand is sucking imports at a worryingly high rate. The American current account is too high at more than 4% of national output. The IMF warns that the <strong> US Federal Reserve</strong> may force a \"hard landing\" scenario - which would mean growth in the US slows down sharply and stock prices fall by up to 20%, dragging down equity markets throughout the world </p> <p><strong> Japan</strong> </p> <p>Hopes have been raised that the Japanese economy is finally on the road to recovery after a decade of stagnation. The country has pencilled in growth of 1.4% for this year and 1.8% in 2001 - but the Japanese government faces many challenges, not least how to support the economic recovery with lower taxes and higher spending when the country already has worryingly high levels of public debt</p>",
  "<p>Looking out across west London, Ian Donoghue moans: \"I've put on a bit of weight since I moved here.\" But it is his only complaint with the one-bedroom apartment in which he bought a 50% share a year ago. </p> <p>Perched on top of Tesco's 24-hour supermarket on the Cromwell Road, you could be mistaken for thinking that Shaftesbury Place - 75 modernist-looking flats, with steel balconies and unsurpassable views of urban landscapes - were \u00a3250,000 Manhattan-style lofts for city bankers. They are, in fact, a mixture of homes for key workers and families from council housing waiting lists. </p> <p>This week, architects, planners and builders are debating the benefits of good design to cities and towns across the country, as part of the annual urban design week. </p> <p>In a speech tomorrow, housing minister Nick Raynsford will be emphasising the government's commitment to reintroduce housing to town centres by encouraging developers to use space above commercial property and converting vacant industrial buildings into a mixture of different housing sizes, types, and affordability, promoting good-quality urban design. </p> <p>However, unless the urban white paper, expected next month, removes many of the obstacles blocking inner-city developments - such as VAT rules that impose a 17.5% charge on refurbishments or conversions, while new build is zero-rated - the vision of an urban renaissance, outlined by the urban taskforce and echoed by government, will remain a dream. </p> <p>When taskforce chair Lord Rogers visited Shaftesbury Place on the eve of urban design week, he described it as \"the type of development that needs to be replicated if our towns and cities are to be revitalised by good design and mixed communities.\" </p> <p>Donoghue works in the NHS as a GP practice manager. He could have been one of the 60,000 key workers estimated to leave the capital in the next 10 years if he had been unable to buy a share of his flat. </p> <p>\"I'd been flat-hunting for two years while camping in a friend's study down the road,\" he says. </p> <p>\"But my salary was way below the \u00a332,000 I would have needed to afford a one-bedroom flat.\" Now he would require an annual income nearer \u00a350,000. </p> <p>He wanted to stay near friends and family in west London. When he saw the Tesco development going up, he knew it could be his only chance. He registered with Kensington &amp; Chelsea council and Notting Hill Home Ownership, part of Notting Hill Housing Group, and waited. He purchased half the \u00a3128,000 flat and pays rent to Notting Hill on the other 50%. His monthly outgoings for the flat are \u00a3600. </p> <p>\"It's not cheap but it is affordable and its low maintenance and closeness to work, reduces my outgoings,\" he says. </p> <p>According to Pete Redman, chief executive of the housing group, Shaftesbury Place is a product of Kensington &amp; Chelsea council's commitment to meeting housing needs in a borough with the highest house prices in the country - planning permission for the superstore was conditional on Tesco developing social housing - and Tesco's innovation and willingness to work with the housing association. </p> <p>Tesco's architect, Auckett Bisco, had to address sound insulation, ventilation and safety issues to create a high-quality living environment above such a busy road. Every room has mechanical ventilation which filters out pollution, but the large, double-glazed windows and french doors can also be opened. </p> <p>\"Shaftesbury Place is an antidote for anyone who still believes that social housing promotes urban decay,\" says Redman. \"It's created a mixed community, including key workers, that mirrors the pattern of many London streets and has brought back into use a prime London site that was all but derelict.\" </p> <p>The scheme's \u00a35.6m costs were met by a mixture of government subsidy, through the Housing Corporation, and private loans raised by Notting Hill. The group believes that low-cost shared ownership schemes which regenerate urban areas should be the model for the government's \"starter home initiative\". Designed as a way of tackling the housing crisis for the capital's key workers, the shape of the \u00a3250m, three-year initiative, announced in the housing green paper earlier this year, is still unclear. </p> <p>The government is considering responses to the green paper. Other options are interest-free loans and cash incentives, although they may do little to address regeneration issues. </p> <p>Nobody doubts the scale of the crisis. Some 40% of teachers are expected to leave London in the next five years. Studies by the King's Fund health policy institute and other influential bodies show teacher and nursing shortages in the capital compounded by difficulties obtaining affordable accommodation. </p> <p>The London Housing Federation has discovered that firemen earning \u00a325,000 a year are commuting from as far as Lincolnshire. But do all key workers want to get a foot on the property ladder? </p> <p>According to Richard McCarthy, the Peabody Trust chief executive, young key workers do not see home ownership as desirable. They want to rent affordable flats. \"For many key workers, they need easy access to a stock of good quality rented accommodation,\" he says. </p> <p> The trust has just won \u00a34.5m single regeneration budget funding as part of a consortium to provide 500 low-cost rented homes for the capital's key workers. The Keep London Working partnership includes five local authorities, three private developers, employer bodies, NHS trusts and bus companies First Group and Go-Ahead Group. </p> <p>Keep London Working taps into the potential for local authorities to allow private developers to build at higher density on condition that additional homes are acquired by housing associations to provide subsidised rented homes for key workers. </p> <p>By November, Peabody Unite, a joint venture between the Peabody Trust and private developer Unite to provide rented accommodation for key workers, will have created more than 600 bed spaces for rent by nurses and other employees of the Royal London hospitals in east London. </p> <p>Two of the schemes are converted from redundant office blocks. The third is a new-build development using low-cost, modular building techniques, pioneered by the Peabody Trust in Hackney. </p> <p>The rooms are built as a single module, or pod, in a factory, fully- furnished off-site and then lowered into place by crane, saving construction time and costs. </p> <p>For Donoghue, he had reached that age where renting was no longer attractive. \"I was in my late 20s and I wanted a place of my own,\" he says. \"Now I hardly go out, I'm always entertaining at home. The view from my balcony is hard to beat.\" </p> <p><strong>Driving force</strong></p> <p>Housing associations risk being sidelined if they are not ready to play a leading role in the government's drive to improve deprived neighbourhoods, the sector's two leading organisations are warning. </p> <p>Associations and other social landlords must ensure they are primed to slip straight into action when implementation of the government's national strategy for neighbourhood renewal starts next spring, according to the National Housing Federation (NHF) and Chartered Institute of Housing (CIH). They say social housing faces a \"unique opportunity\". </p> <p>The warning comes as the federation today opens its annual conference, in Birmingham. Jim Coulter, NHF chief executive, says: \"This is the sector's chance... to contribute to a genuine and sustained improvement in the quality of life for people living in deprived neighbourhoods.\" </p> <p>A final version of the renewal strategy is expected this autumn, together with an action plan. But housing groups have already been told they are \"well placed\" to deliver neighbourhood management - in partnership with others. </p> <p>The federation and institute are stressing that collaboration is critical. They are telling housing groups to check that they are involved with local schools and health services; that they understand the local labour market and help promote employment; that they play a part in tackling crime; and, not least, that they have local plans of their own to improve housing stock. </p> <p> David Brindle</p>"
