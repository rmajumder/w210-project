  "<p>The US dollar, government bonds and gold were in high demand last night as international investors sought refuge after one of the most tumultuous days in years on the global financial markets. </p> <p>Sterling and the Swiss franc were also sought after in a flight to quality which saw dealers mark down the value of any assets seen as remotely risky. Developing countries from the Phillipines to Poland saw their currencies unceremoniously dumped. </p> <p>With the US dollar apparently impervious to the precipitous drop in share prices on Wall Street, the euro dropped to less than 86.5 cents against the US currency, below the level at which the G7 stepped in to deter speculative attacks last month. </p> <p>The pound rose to a five-month high against the single currency, with one euro costing just under 59p. </p> <p>Sterling's trade-weighted index rose to 109.6, its highest since May, when it hit 14-year peaks. </p> <p>Bond markets saw a marked divergence between strong demand for government stock -both in the US and Europe -and weakness in the corporate bond market, where investors were demanding higher returns to compensate for a perceived increase in risk. </p> <p>Gold - historically the safest of havens in times of crisis -rose by more than $3 an ounce to $276.10, but is still far below its peak of $800 reached during the oil crisis of the 1970s.</p>",
  "<p>Suddenly the drama threatens to turn into a full blown crisis. The television screens are full of Israeli helicopters hitting targets in the Gaza strip. Gunboats patrol menacingly offshore. </p> <p>The response of the world's financial markets has been swift. Equity markets, led by Wall Street, are in a spin, bond and currency markets look even more fragile than earlier in the week. The oil price has jumped to $35 a barrel and already there is panicky talk in the market that - if the worst comes to the worst - it could hit $100. \"Flight to quality\" has become the predictable mantra. </p> <p>But hang on. Haven't we been here before? Oil crises are nothing new. Policy makers have learned how to cope; they know which levers to pull to keep the global economy on course. </p> <p>Well, up to a point. We have certainly been here before - three times, since the Yom Kippur war of 1973 brought the long boom to a halt. The reason it did so was that a five-fold increase in the cost of energy added to already strong inflationary pressure. By adding to the costs of almost everything it hit incomes and profits, dashing consumer and corporate confidence. When central banks raised interest rates to combat higher inflation all the conditions were in place for the dreaded stagflation. </p> <p>Subsequent oil shocks - in 1979-80 and 1990-91 - ultimately led to slower growth and higher unemployment. The current increase, if sustained, could have the same effect, particularly since the strong growth in the global economy means there is little spare capacity for the Opec oil cartel to raise production. The real doomsday scenario would be for Saudi Arabia - the world's biggest oil producers and the most dovish of the Opec members - to became embroiled in a wider middle east conflict. </p> <p>What are the risks? The optimistic view is that dearer energy leads to the pricking of the US stock market bubble, thereby obviating the need for further increases in US interest rates. As a result the US economy slows gently from its recent breakneck speed and experiences a soft landing. For that to happen, peace efforts in the middle east would have to bear fruit relatively quickly. </p> <p>A slightly darker view is that the tension is protracted, leading to a prolonged period of higher oil prices and continuing uncertainties in the financial markets. </p> <p>The blackest outlook of all would be one where the conflict dragged in other countries, drove a wedge between the Saudis and the US and led not just to a fall in share prices but to a systemic crisis in the entire financial sector. </p> <p>Regulators have already had a warning of what could happen. During the Russian debt crisis two years ago they were forced to rescue a high profile hedge fund - Long Term Capital Management - to prevent market meltdown. </p> <p>Signs of distress are already evident. The spread between AAA-rated US corporate bonds and treasury paper - always a measure of investor nervousness - has widened and is close to the levels during the LTCM crisis. </p> <p>If it does look like there is the possibility of real distress in the financial sector. US Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan may be tempted to cut interest rates, as he has in the past, to prevent a 1930s style slump. </p> <p>But he will not be able to do that if workers facing lower real incomes because of higher inflation demand higher wages. Central banks have already warned that they would respond to such an eventuality by raising interest rates rather than risk a return of the inflationary problems of the past. If the long-run response were dearer not cheaper money the global economy would not have a hard landing but a crash.</p>",
  "<p>Michael Philipp, the new head of asset management at Deutsche Bank, last night outlined a plan to diversify the business as part of an attempt to double assets under management within five years. </p> <p>In the first of three global \"town hall\" meetings with staff around the world, Mr Philipp emphasised the need to offer more alternative investment products such as venture capital and hedge funds and to expand in the American and Asian retail markets. </p> <p>Deutsche, which bought Morgan Grenfell in the UK six years ago, already manages about\u00a3410bn of assets, making it one of the largest fund managers in the world. A report commissioned from McKinsey, the management consultants, earlier this year suggested that growth in the asset management business could lead to a trebling of net income and a doubling of assets within five years. </p> <p>Mr Philipp, who was appointed to the asset management job in June, is one of two former Wall Street bankers appointed to the managing board of the bank this summer. In an interview with the Guardian, he said that while the asset management business was already extremely profitable, \"we need to diversify by product and geography to have a really good business\". The group has a strong retail presence in Germany and Italy and a good institutional business in the UK. Its US business largely consists of lower margin products. </p> <p>Mr Philipp has already restructured the asset management division into similar reporting lines as those put in place in investment banking. A seven-strong management commitee has been set up along global/regional and product/sales lines. </p> <p>The new structure will be explained to staff in London and Frankfurt next week. Headhunters have circled the UK division since Mr Philipp's appointment. </p> <p>Mr Philipp helped negotiate the bank's acquisition of Natwest's derivatives business and its takeover of Bankers Trust two years ago and few believe that his dealmaking will go to waste in asset management. </p> <p>He denied, however, that Deutsche needed to make a large acquisition. \"Joint ventures and partnerships are going to be much more important going forward, everybody realises big deals don't always make sense,\" he said. </p> <p>Industry analysts believe this could also give the group a breathing space to consolidate a fragmented asset management businsess.</p>",
  "<p>Wall Street suffered a savage blow to its fragile confidence yesterday when fears of an all-out war in the middle east triggered panic selling of blue chip and technology stocks. </p> <p>In a market already alarmed by a growing number of profit warnings, the Dow Jones was down 350 points by lunchtime in New York and on the brink of falling below 10,000 for the first time since March. </p> <p>Technology shares continued to fall, with the Nasdaq index dipping below its lowest point of the year with a fall of more than 70 points to 3020 at lunchtime. </p> <p>The sell-off was caused by news of a terrorist attack on a US navy destroyer and an Israeli assault on Yasser Arafat's West Bank headquarters. </p> <p>Violence in the middle east forced a rise of more than $3 in the oil price, increasing the risks of a hard landing for the world's biggest economy. </p> <p>US share prices fell so sharply that they triggered trading curbs designed to slow markets in times of turmoil. </p> <p>Following Wall Street's lead, the Euro Stoxx 50 index of euro zone blue chips tumbled 1% after being sharply higher earlier in the day, although it later pared losses and eventually registered small gains. </p> <p>Investors in the London market also suffered a see-saw ride, with a gain of almost 100 points on the FTSE 100 index quickly erased by a fall of 143 to a five-month low of 6068.3. </p> <p>The FTSE 100 later recovered to close up 14.3 points at 6131.9 but was vulnerable to further bad news, dealers said. </p> <p>\"It's teetering on the edge, the market desperately needs some good news and at the moment I don't know where it's going to find it,\" said one senior equity salesman. </p> <p>Dealers said that only gains in defensive bank stocks and oil companies managed to keep the London market in positive territory. </p> <p>At worst, dealers fear a full-blown war in the middle east would lead to a rerun of the 1973-74 oil crisis, which was followed by a global recession. </p> <p>But some analysts sought to calm the mood by saying that the downturn in equity prices represented a healthy correction after a long period of excessive valuations. </p> <p>\"The world is not coming to an end,\" said Alan Skrainka, chief markets strategist at the investment house Edwards Jones. </p> <p>G7 Group, the Washington-based firm of analysts, said investors hoping for a cut in US interest rates to ease the gloom in the markets were likely to be disappointed. </p> <p>\"Fed chairman Alan Greenspan is probably pretty comfortable with the market environment,\" the firm said. \"After all, this past spring the Fed was looking for an orderly reversal of the Nasdaq bubble. And, despite the doom and gloom surrounding a possible market implosion, the bubble is deflating with relatively little collateral damage to the rest of the economy.\" </p> <p>A profits warning by the US DIY retailer Home Depot reinforced fears that higher oil prices and the weak euro would lead to widespread earnings disappointment at the start of the quarterly results season. Financial services companies continued to be hit hard after a difficult week amid fears of trading losses.</p>",
  "<p>Panic stricken traders drove world oil prices to 10- year highs yesterday as the intensifying crisis in the middle east raised fears that a squeeze on global energy supplies could drive crude prices even higher. </p> <p>Brent crude broke through $35 a barrel for the first time since 1990, rising $3.51 to $35.30 before easing in late trading. US light crudes were $2.10 stronger at $35.35. </p> <p>US heating oil prices broke 10-year records yesterday, hitting $1.11 a barrel, the highest level since 1979. Middle east tensions added to concerns that America may run out of heating oil over the winter. </p> <p>The US department of energy reported yesterday that national heating oil stocks fell 1.3m barrels last week to 46.6m barrels, more than a third lower then a year ago. </p> <p>One analyst warned that, with most big oil exporters already pumping at capac ity, any disruption to production could drive prices above $100 a barrel. </p> <p>As news flashed up on dealing screens that Israeli helicopter gunships had fired at targets near Palestinian president Yasser Arafat's headquarters, one trader reported that panic buying had set in. </p> <p>Traders fear a region that holds the bulk of the world's petroleum reserves could cut supply to the west at a time when booming world demand has already resulted in some of the highest energy prices since the invasion of Kuwait. </p> <p>\"If there was a serious threat to supplies you would be talking about oil at $100 a barrel,\" said Lawrence Eagles, a commodities analyst with GNL. \"It's not like the Gulf War, which took out Iraq, but Saudi Arabia had 5m barrels a day of spare capacity. This time everybody is pumping oil flat out. If this went horribly wrong, the sky is the limit for oil prices.\"</p> <p>Useful links: <br> <a href=\"http://www.secretary.state.gov/index.html\">Madeleine Albright's office</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.p-p-o.com\">Yasser Arafat's office</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.pmo.gov.il/english\">Ehud Barak's office</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.index.gov.il/eng\">Israeli government</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.pna.org\">Palestinian National Authority</a></p>",
  "<p>Scientists who borrowed a leaf from the gardening manuals have confirmed that the oceans can bloom with trillions of tiny plants - if someone sprinkles a little mineral fertiliser first. </p> <p>More importantly, the phytoplankton - the tiny green plants - can soak up huge quantities of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, provided they have enough iron in the oceanic equivalent of topsoil. </p> <p>An international team of scientists reports in Nature today that they tipped more than three tons of dissolved iron into a 50 square kilometre patch of sea off Antarctica. Over the next two weeks they measured the levels of dissolved carbon dioxide in the surface waters and noted that it had fallen by 10% as the algae began to bloom. They calculated that 1,000 tons of carbon had been taken up by the plants. </p> <p>When the scientists checked satellite images six weeks later, their original 50km square \"lawn\" had been stretched by ocean currents to a ribbon more than 150km long. </p> <p>All plants need water, and carbon and nitrogen from the air, to grow. But they also need tiny quantities of other nutrients to make this growth possible. In 1990, an American oceanographer called John Martin argued that the reason the oceans weren't teeming with plant life was a shortage of iron. </p> <p>In 1993, Andrew Watson of the University of East Anglia began a series of tests. The latest voyage of the \"Soiree\" team - Soiree stands for southern ocean iron release experiment - confirmed that the hypothesis was as true for near freezing oceans as for tropical ones. </p> <p>But, Prof Watson warned, the experiment did not offer a solution to the problem of global warming. </p> <p>Ever since the first alarms about the greenhouse effect there have been hopes of a \"technical fix\". But, he said, the process could only take carbon dioxide from the atmosphere at a certain rate. The value of the experiment lay in what it could reveal about the history of the earth during the last 400,000 years. </p> <p>\"The changes we saw after adding the iron may well explain past changes in the earth's carbon dioxide levels during and at the end of the ice ages. It is evident that this is a driver for climate change. We know that there was a far higher flux of iron in the atmospheric dust to the oceans in glacial times. Our study indicates this was responsible for about half of the big change in atmospheric carbon dioxide that occurred then,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>BSkyB and Channel 4 have teamed up with racecourse owner Arena Leisure in an attempt to outbid Carlton Communications for the global media rights to UK horseracing. </p> <p>The three partners are forming a joint venture, NewCo, that is expected to make a formal offer to the 59 UK racecourses within two weeks. The bid is likely to cover worldwide TV, internet and interactive rights for events including Royal Ascot and the Grand National. </p> <p>Arena Leisure - which owns six British racecourses - earlier this month saw its previous \u00a3320m bid topped by Carlton, which offered \u00a3400m. Arena is also reported to be in talks with the BBC - which currently shares terrestrial coverage of UK horse racing with Channel 4 - about selling on some of the rights. </p> <p>Earlier this year, Channel 4 and NTL withdrew a joint bid for UK horseracing rights after failing to agree a deal with the racecourse owners. </p> <p>Ian Penrose, Arena finance director, said: \"Our partnership with Channel 4 and BSkyB combines all the necessary broadcasting, technology, interactive gaming and racing experience, expertise and contacts to develop UK racing as a truly global media and gaming product.</p> <p>\"We are confident that the UK racecourses will appreciate this partnership is best placed to maximise enhanced revenue streams to racing,\" he added.</p>",
  "<p>Adidas has unveiled a major new brand strategy designed to broaden its appeal in an increasingly competitive market.</p> <p>The move is aimed at changing the perception of the sportswear giant as a purely sports brand to enable it to compete more effectively with fashion retailers such as Tommy Hilfiger, Polo and the Gap. </p> <p>As the line between sportswear and fashion becomes increasingly blurred, sportswear manufacturers such as Adidas and Nike are having to face up to competition from unexpected quarters. Analysts estimate that 80% of sportswear is now worn as casualwear.</p> <p>Erich Stamminger, head of global marketing at Adidas, said: \"Beginning today our brand position will be 'Forever sport - from competition to lifestyle'. We want to mean more to people. We want to expand our customer base and gain deeper market penetration in our existing markets.\"</p> <p>As part of the reorganisation. Adidas is setting up a new division, Original, to capitalise on the trend for retro sportswear. Original will produce Adidas-branded casual wear, including limited edition remakes of traditional Adidas designs and updated versions of old Adidas products.</p>",
  "<p>Vivendi Universal, the media giant to be formed by the proposed merger of French media company Vivendi and Seagram of Canada, will be \"a global company for the digital age\", according to its chairman-in-waiting.</p> <p>Jean-Marie Messier, the chairman of Vivendi and proposed head of the new company, made the comment at an investors' presentation in Paris. He was joined by Edgar Bronfman, the president of Seagram, and Pierre Lescure, chief executive of Vivendi's pay TV arm, Canal Plus.</p> <p>Mr Messier said the merger, which could be approved by EC regulators as early as tomorrow, will add E420m (\u00a3249m) to the combined group's pre-tax earnings by 2002. Vivendi Universal will combine Vivendi's telecoms and internet operations with Seagram's Universal Studios and Universal Music subsidiaries.</p> <p>Mr Messier said: \"Vivendi Universal will be a global company for the digital age...

  "Donald Dewar, the Scottish First Minister, who has died aged 63, was one of the unlikeliest of Scottish heroes. In a land that reveres fighters and footballers, Dewar did not fit the mould. He was a shambolic figure, lanky, almost perpetually stooped from a bad back and, in an age of volatility in Scottish politics, he was forever an advocate of moderation and caution. <p>And yet his entry in Scottish history books will be large, as the man who finally brought back a Scottish parliament almost three centuries after it was dissolved in the Union with England. He kept the devolution cause alive in Labour circles over three turbulent decades and his proudest moment in politics was when he finally delivered. </p> <p>He confided to one of his aides that the opening of the Scottish parliament in July last year had been the best and most eventful day of his life. He wandered the streets of Edinburgh that night with a permanent smile, revelling in the goodwill of the Scottish public. </p> <p>Two weeks later, he was on the receiving end of a battering from sections of the Scottish press who had decided devolution was a mess. That's Scottish politics, as Dewar knew all too well. </p> <p>On the whole, he remained popular, as the emotional reaction to his death has shown. He was regarded as fundamentally decent, but more than that, the public liked the fact that he did not fit the image of the modern politician. He was unhappy with soundbites, eschewing hyperbole, delivering measured but stuttering opinions. To the despair of his advisers and colleagues, he would even acknowledge in public the merit of an opponent's arguments. </p> <p>They despaired even more at his election campaigning techniques. For him, a good night out was driving around Glasgow or some other part of the west of Scotland, helping activists climb up ladders, putting up posters, and then piling into a curry shop. That was fine, but he was doing this at a time when he was supposed to be masterminding election campaigns from Labour's Glasgow HQ. In the end the party gave up, and during the Scottish election campaign last year the chancellor, Gordon Brown, was installed to take charge while Dewar was sent out to tour Scotland by bus. </p> <p>In spite of discomfort with modern political techniques, he did have lots of tactical nous, successfully fending off the Scottish National party during his long tenure in charge of the Labour party in Scotland. </p> <p>Donald Dewar was born into a middle-class household in Glasgow. He blamed his shyness and gauche manner on his upbringing, as the only child of elderly parents. He went to the fee-paying Glasgow Academy, which he disliked, making few friends. </p> <p>His life changed when he went to Glasgow University, where he became part of a close circle that included John Smith, who was to become Labour leader and who shared Dewar's passion for devolution, and Menzies Campbell, the Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman. The Glasgow University Union debate on Friday nights was a bearpit, attended by drunken students howling from the balcony, and it was there that Dewar developed his debating skills: after those debates, Westminster was easy. </p> <p>He met his wife, Alison, a doctor's daughter, at the university, and they married in 1964. Two years later, he left his beloved Glasgow to represent Aberdeen South at Westminster. </p> <p>His life reached its lowest point in 1970. The back problem that was to cause him pain throughout the rest of his days began, he lost his seat in the general election and his marriage broke up - a setback from which he never recovered. Alison left him for another lawyer, Derry Irvine, now Lord Irvine of Lairg and Lord Chancellor, and took the children, Ian and Marion, with her. </p> <p>He never remarried and spent the rest of his life in what had been the matrimonial home, an elegant house in Glasgow's posh West End. Although he was sociable, fond of company and with a dry sense of humour, he was also a bit of a recluse. Invitations to his home were few. </p> <p>Asked once about his perfect Christmas, he replied it would be spent alone, with an oven-ready meal and a stack of books. And that is how he did spend many Christmases, even though he had plenty of offers from friends to join them. </p> <p>In 1978, he made his comeback to politics, beating off a challenge by the SNP in the Glasgow Garscadden by-election. It was an important victory, as the SNP, with the rallying cry of \"It's Scotland's oil\", had been surging ahead. He held the seat (renamed Glasgow Anniesland for the 1997 election) until his death. His constituency consisted mainly of Drumchapel, one of the four sprawling council estates that mark each corner of the city, areas of intense social deprivation. </p> <p> The poverty that he saw each time he visited his constituency - and he did so frequently - was central to his politics. He never shifted from his brand of socialism, a commitment to more equal distribution, combined with large dollops of pragmatism. Although he was on the right of the party during the battles with the left in the 1980s and was loyal to Tony Blair most of the time, much of his politics would come to be regarded as old Labour. </p> <p>He led the Labour party as shadow Scottish secretary during the 1980s, a difficult time given that the Tories under Thatcher had control at Westminster while Scotland was returning a majority of Labour MPs. He was under pressure from Scottish Labour MPs who wanted radical action; there was even a proposal that they refuse to remain at Westminster in the aftermath of the 1987 general election and instead decamp to Edinburgh. </p> <p>To release some of the tension, Dewar, though privately disparaging stunts, did lead a walkout of Scottish Labour MPs from the Commons chamber soon after the election. Much more significant was his decision to participate in the Scottish constitutional convention, an unusual experiment in British politics. Labour sat down with rival political parties, the churches, trade unions and other representatives of Scottish life to work out a blueprint for a Scottish parliament. </p> <p>Dewar totally opposed Scottish independence and argued consistently that the country benefited from remaining in the Union with England. He demonstrated his distaste for the SNP by petulantly blocking in 1997 a knighthood for Sean Connery because he financed the SNP. </p> <p>Although Dewar was opposed to political nationalism, he was a strong cultural nationalist. He saw little reason to leave Scotland, an inclination that his aides only fully became aware of in the late 1980s when, as shadow Scottish secretary, he was due to make a trip abroad and informed them he did not have a passport. </p> <p>He had a huge collection of books about Scotland, concentrating on its history and reflecting his special interest in the Jacobite rebellion in the 18th century and the splits in the church in the 19th. But he had an unpredictable take on Scottish history, believing, for instance, that the Highland Clearances had been justified. He also collected Scottish paintings, especially those of the Colourists. </p> <p>He further showed his pas sion for Scotland in his love of Scottish football, attending most of the national team's games, sometimes in the company of his friend, the chancellor, Gordon Brown. </p> <p>In 1992, when John Smith became Labour leader, he decided Dewar had been in Scotland too long and needed a change; Smith made him shadow social services secretary, a stint he followed as chief whip. </p> <p> After the 1997 general election, Dewar turned his back on UK posts in the cabinet and the chance to become one of the most senior figures in the Blair government, and returned to Scotland, to the job he had long coveted, Scottish secretary. </p> <p>With an overwhelming vote for devolution achieved in the referendum on September 11 that year, he sat down to draft the Scotland bill that would make a Scottish parliament a reality. </p> <p>The draft he presented to Tony Blair and other cabinet colleagues created alarm because it was seen as too nationalist. The Lord Chancellor, Lord Irvine, was told to sort it out. The battles between the two in cabinet committee were bruising, perhaps overlaid with a residual personal animosity. Dewar had not spoken to Irvine from the time he left with his wife in 1970 until the two were pushed together at the funeral of John Smith, more than two decades later. Dewar came off second best in the early stages of the committee meetings but eventually got the upper hand, securing most of what he wanted in the Scotland Act. </p> <p>Dewar earned himself the label of \"father of the nation\" in some papers but it never took hold, not least because he was embarrassed by it. </p> <p>The birth of the parliament in Edinburgh has been tempestuous, with rows over Section 28, the mounting cost of the parliament building and the exam results fiasco. He was accused of being a poor administrator and of failing to delegate to colleagues. </p> <p>The conclusion gained ground that he was the right person to deliver devolution but not to run Scotland. Ambitious colleagues had begun planning for the succession even last year. </p> <p>In April this year, he was taken to Glasgow royal infirmary after the discovery of heart irregularities, and had surgery the following month. He never fully recovered his health, and appeared to be permanently tired. </p> <p>He looked gloomy most of the time, being one of life's pessimists. Even John Smith said: \"The only time Donald is happy is when he is totally miserable\". It was a jibe made in jest by a man who had much fondness for him. Smith made it because he knew that deep down it basically was not true, and it was certainly not true of that day in July last year when Dewar gave Scotland its parliament. </p> <p>He is survived by his son and daughter. </p> <p>\u0095 Donald Campbell Dewar, politician, born August 21 1937; died October 11 2000 </p> <p> </p> <p> <b> Brian Wilson</b>, minister of state at the Scotland Office, writes: I first heard Donald Dewar speaking from a public platform more than 30 years ago. Characteristically, he was supporting the Labour candidacy of a Glasgow University pal in the hopeless seat of Argyll. As this gangling figure rattled out defences of Harold Wilson's policies, many of which I suspect he viewed with deepest scepticism, my father observed to me quietly: \"That's the kind of Labour man I like.\" </p> <p>It was an accolade which I often recalled in later years, at moments when Donald's extreme caution and suspicion of radical initiatives seemed distinctly mixed blessings. What my father had identified was the quintessential Dewar blend, which made Labour difficult to disagree with and hence the natural party of government. It combined absolute loyalty, acute intelligence and clear social commitment with good humour, courtesy and moderation. </p> <p>These were the characteristics that made him the kind of Labour man that most of Scotland liked, trusted and today mourns. The inevitable parallels with the death of John Smith are unnervingly close. They came from the same political mould; followed the same professions; achieved similar levels of respect across generations, classes and creeds. And both could claim, more persuasively than most politicians, that they had remained constant in their views while the world changed around them. </p> <p>The only difference was that Donald never really wanted to ply his trade anywhere but in Scotland. He was a superb House of Commons performer and a major political figure. But his politics were, above all, about the future of Scotland, which he knew and cared for deeply. While others who had espoused the cause of devolution balanced the options and chose to stay at Westminster, there was never the slightest doubt where Donald's heart and hopes would lie when the choice had to be made. </p> <p>In his more introspective moments, Donald would speak about the solitariness of his childhood. He was an only child born quite late in his parents' lives, brought up in the austere environment of post-war, middle-class Glasgow, frequently farmed out to family friends due to his father's poor health, awkward of gait and appearance. Small wonder that the wonderful world he discovered at Glasgow University became the touchstone for his lifelong loyalties. </p> <p>It was the world of John Smith, razor-sharp debating, forensic examination of weighty issues and Gaitskellite intrigues. To recapture just one image which Donald liked to describe, it was the world of hitching down the A1 to a Fabian weekend school, himself and John equipped only with a hip-flask filled with whisky. This was the period which, to an extraordinary degree, conditioned the rest of his life and kept him close to Glasgow and the friendships he valued so much. </p> <p>Donald was the wittiest and most gregarious of men. Like quite a few others, my wife and I would feed him at the briefest of notice and be repaid with an evening of non-malicious gossip, absurd tales from the Labour movement and descriptions of the latest crisis to afflict our electoral prospects, all within an atmosphere which swung between gloom and hilarity. And when he left, it always saddened us to know that it was probably to go home to an empty house - a reality which he felt more than he ever said. </p> <p> In a world of happy endings, Donald would have accepted the accolades of the crowd on the day when he walked with the Queen to the opening of the Scottish parliament. That was the summit of his life's work, and the happiness in his face that day is the image that should be preserved of him. He should have flourished as a much-loved national figure, dividing his time among royal commissions, football and antiquarian bookshops. He should have enjoyed time with his son and daughter, of whom he was so proud. He should, he should, he should. </p> <p>But politics is a brutal business which does not believe in happy endings. So instead, Donald carried on - head and shoulders above all around him, but still fair game for the slings and arrows which soon beset the Scottish parliament. Criticism and argument were meat and drink to him. But he was hurt and bewildered by the constant stream of vitriol as Scotland became a goldfish bowl in which every grievance, real or imagined, was magnified out of all rational proportion. </p> <p>He came back from major heart surgery far too soon, for reasons that were inherent in his dominance of Scottish politics for so long. He had become indispensable. There were crises to be resolved which needed his steady hand and acute mind. But now he has been dispensed with and the political life of Scotland will go on - less stylishly, less intelligently, less decently, but it will go on. The trick is to recognise that before it is too late.</p>",
  "<p>The former editor of the NME believes the internet could sound the death-knell of the traditional rock'n'roll journalist.</p> <p>Steve Sutherland, who quit as NME editor earlier this year to become brand director for IPC Music &amp; Sport, said that the passionate, opinionated rants that have characterised music journalism for the past 30 years \"may not be appropriate\" in the internet age. </p> <p>Asked whether rock and roll journalism was dead, Mr Sutherland said: \"I do wonder about that.\" He added that the internet had \"radically changed\" the relationship between the magazine and its readers. \"The word community is over-used, but that's exactly what we're creating now online. </p> <p> \"Every day I open up my email box and found I've got 10 emails from complete strangers about everything from the mismanagement of the Radiohead gig to the interview in the paper.\" </p> <p>Mr Sutherland said that the internet meant that journalists \"should now be able to remove themselves from the equation between artist and fan, leaving the two to get more in touch with one another\".</p> <p>He said that opinion, criticism and in-depth analysis would become even stronger in the print versions with news gradually phased out. </p> <p>Mr Sutherland's comments came as NME.com announced it is to relaunch on Monday, backed by a multi-million pound investment from parent company IPC Media.</p> <p>With a team of 30 staff working out of the NME's editorial offices at Kings Reach Tower, Mr Sutherland said the site would be faster and more functional and that there would be greater emphasis on \"broadcast values\". </p> <p>The relaunch aims to position NME.com as a definitive music portal, providing music news to a global audience.</p> <p>Anthony Thornton, editor of NME.com, said that the philosophy was to give users everything they could, and if they couldn't then it would show them where to get it. Mr Thornton claimed the site had 1.3m unique users and said traffic was growing by 5-10% per month.</p> <p>New features include MyNME, a personalised service allowing users to create their own space on the site and communicate with other users, an expanded artist database and an interactive gig guide.</p>",
  "<p>Whether it is Ed McBain, Colleen McCullough or AN Other, one author will be $100,000 better off at the end of next week's Frankfurt Book Fair, when the biggest literary prize in history will go to the best original electronic book. </p> <p>But publishers and agents at the show already have 500,000 reasons to be interested in e-books: that's how many downloaded Stephen King's novel, Riding The Bullet, in its first two days online this summer. Many didn't pay for it, and lots didn't read it, but King showed beyond argument that e-books can reach a mass market. </p> <p>Electronic book publishing has many of the same risks and opportunities as electronic music publishing. By delivering text direct to the reader's computer screen, the e-book could slash production and distribution costs, and allow creators to deal directly with their audience, bypassing conventional publishers and retailers. But it also raises the spectre of mass piracy. Phil Rance, founder and managing director of Online Originals, a London-based e-book publisher, sums it up: \"No one wants Napster to happen to books.\" </p> <p>Indeed, the MP3 saga may have put the frighteners on an industry that generally operates some way behind the \"bleeding edge\". The Meta Group, a leading US-based market analyst, say publishers are far too concerned about protecting their rights: \"We believe all the recent legal manoeuvring over Napster is like putting a finger in a dyke that is already overflowing. Publishers need to deal with reality and come up with new ways to exploit wide electronic distribution, asking the question: 'How can we use the inevitability of wide distribution to our advantage?' \" </p> <p>At the moment, most publishers would like to limit the use of e-books to the person who bought them, or to the computer used to download them. If that can be done, e-books become just an extra revenue stream in a publishing industry that would continue to operate the way it does today, according to Terry Robinson, business manager for Adobe's e-paper group. \"If you've cracked the digital rights aspect, you've cracked the market,\" he says. </p> <p>Robert Nichols, Books Director at BOL - a subsidiary of Bertelsmann, the world's biggest publishing company - agrees. \"Rights management is absolutely critical: that's the key comfort area they want addressed. Publishers just pull down the shutters and say that 'until copyright is secure, we're not going to talk'.\" </p> <p>But Rebecca Ulph, an analyst at Forrester Research's London office, is not sure the two industries are all that alike. \"Something like 7.5% of the people in the UK are responsible for about 75% of the book sales, and until e-books are routinely available to technophobes on the high street, they're never going to be more than a niche market,\" she says. </p> <p>\"And there's nothing fun damentally wrong with the book,\" says Ulph, \"so there's really no problem the e-book solves, unless you need to carry around 10 or 12 books at a time. Otherwise, the electronic book is a \u00a3300-\u00a3400 format that doesn't actually improve on a \u00a36.99 format.\" </p> <p>US sales of dedicated e-book readers costing around $199 to $599 bear this out. <a href=\"http://www.rocket-ebook.com\">NuvoMedia's Rocket eBook</a> and <a href=\"http://www.softbook.com/reader/\"> SoftBook Press's SoftBook Reader</a> have been slow to take off, and even slower to reach Europe. Last year, BOL signed a deal with Rocket, and it launched the eBook in Germany this April, but Nichols says it is unlikely to reach the UK until next year. </p> <p> The process was slowed after Gemstar International Group Ltd, which produces TV programme guides, took over both NuvoMedia and SoftBook Press at the start of the year. In the US, Thomson Consumer Electronics has just produced a new model, the RCA eBook, with a built-in 56k modem for downloading content, but it is too early to judge how it will do. </p> <p>Andrew Rosenheim, managing director of Penguin Press and acting head of the company's digital media operations, believes that if the market is going to take off, it won't be due to sales of dedicated e-book readers. \"I think it's going to happen in handhelds,\" he says. </p> <p>\"Convergence is happening. People aren't going to want to carry a mobile phone and an e-book and a laptop computer. They'll want something that will do everything and read .\" </p> <p>That is the way Microsoft is heading with its PocketPC software, which is used by the Hewlett-Packard Jornada, Casio Cassiopeia and Compaq iPaq palmtop computers launched this summer. The PocketPC (Windows CE 3) software includes electronic organiser functions, email and web browsing programs, an MP3 player, and Microsoft Reader e-book software. And millions more are already reading documents on Palm and Psion handheld though - worryingly for the industry - generally not in copy-protected formats. </p> <p>Probably no one will pay \u00a3250-\u00a3500 for a Palm, a Psion or a PocketPC just to read books on a small screen. However, millions buying handheld computers to organise their lives will want to use the same device for other purposes, and e-books are another application. </p> <p>This also applies to desktop computers, where both Adobe Acrobat and the <a href=\"http://www.glassbook.com\">Glassbook reader</a> may be used for reading books. Adobe, which took over Glassbook in August, says it has distributed more than 165 million copies of its <a href=\"http://www.adobe.co.uk/products/acrobat/readstep.html\">free Acrobat reader</a>. But now this faces competition from the Microsoft Reader, which is already available for desktop and notebook <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/reader/\">PCs running Windows</a>, and will appear for Apple Macintoshes later. (Officially this has not been announced but a spokesman points out that \"the Macintosh is a very important platform for Microsoft\".) </p> <p>The battle between Adobe and Microsoft is unlikely to turn into a standards war. The two programs have different origins and different uses, and anyway, it is easy for publishers to convert texts between formats. There is also an open standard being set by the <a href=\"http://www.openebook.org\">Open EBook Forum</a>, which both Microsoft and Adobe support. The OEB is, very sensibly, based on the technologies used to create web pages, such as HTML (HyperText Mark-up Language), XML (Extensible Mark-up Language), and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). </p> <p>But publishers don't want to release books in an open format. They want to release them in a protected binary format, which eventually boils down to a choice between Microsoft Reader's .lit file, which is an encrypted form of OEB, and Adobe's PDF (portable document format), a non-OEB format derived from the PostScript publishing language. </p> <p>Adobe has the advantage that PDF is well established in the printing and publishing industries, for which it was designed. It is also well placed as a secure format with PDF Merchant server software to look after rights and payments. And if the market moves rapidly to electronic distribution, with books being printed on demand at local outlets, that will also benefit Adobe: PDF's whole raison d' tre was to mimic print publications. </p> <p>However, the Acrobat PDF reader is not even available for handheld computers, and it has other drawbacks. Acrobat is much clunkier than Microsoft Reader software, which is a proper electronic book system, designed for consumer use. It also lacks Reader's ClearType font technology (see <a href=\"http://grc.com/cleartype.htm\" target=\"_new\">http://grc.com/cleartype.htm</a>), which makes text easier to read. </p> <p>For Adobe, Robinson says: \"We've shown PDF working in the Windows CE environment and on personal digital assistants: they're not commercially available at this stage, but we've shown the intent.\" He also says Adobe is bringing out CoolType technology to improve legibility on the screen. But as Nichols says: \"All the time, Reader is gaining ground, and when colour PocketPCs come down in price_\" </p> <p>Also, anyone with a PC can create e-books for Microsoft Reader using a free add-in for <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/reader/info/selfpublish.htm\">Word 2000</a> or Overdrive's free <a href=\"http://www.overdrive.com/readerworks/downloads/\">Readerworks</a>. Adobe charges for PDFWriter and Acrobat Distiller, the programs usually used to create PDF files, though there are now shareware tools and print utilities to do the job. Examples include SanFace's Txt2PDF, The Amyuni PDF Converter, and Win2PDF. </p> <p>For Microsoft, e-books are part of a long term strategy. Bill Hill, a researcher with Microsoft's electronic books group in Seattle, and one of ClearType's developers, says: \"We believe that the screen is the place where people are going to read in the future. Do you really think that in 20 years time we're still going to be cutting down trees for tomorrow's edition of the Guardian? So our strategy is to create an industry.\" </p> <p>There hasn't been enough content to encourage sales of e-book readers, and not enough readers to encourage publishers, Hill explains. \"We saw an opportunity to jump-start the market by producing Reader. Suddenly you can offer publishers a potential market of several hundred million users - especially if you give it away! It's like a snowball rolling down a hill: somebody has to get it going.\" </p> <p>Rance, who started Online Originals in 1996, quotes Andersen Consulting's forecast that e-books will have 10% or the market by 2005. He thinks \"there will be a serious market - one you can make money in - by this time next year, but only the beginnings of one.\" </p> <p>At Penguin, Rosenheim thinks it will be three to five years before the e-book market becomes viable. \"In terms of it becoming roughly equivalent to print sales, I do think that will happen, but in 20-25 years,\" he says. \"New generations, younger people without the traditional attachment to print, will find the shift easier to make. Books are just one of a number of options to them, so if books become electronic, they won't have an inherent resistance to that. </p> <p> <strong> Web addresses </strong></p> <p><strong> Frankfurt E-book Awards</strong> <br> <a href=\"http://www.iebaf.org\">www.iebaf.org</a> <br> <strong> Online Originals</strong> <br> <a href=\"http://www.onlineoriginals.com \">www.onlineoriginals.com</a> <br> <strong> University of Virginia Etext Center</strong> <br> <a href=\"http://etext.virginia.edu/ebooks/\" target=\"_new\">http://etext.virginia.edu/ebooks/</a> <br> <strong> Books for PDAs</strong> <br> <a href=\"http://www.memoware.com\">www.memoware.com</a> <br> <strong> Barnes &amp; Noble eBookstore</strong> <br> <a href=\"http://ebooks.barnesandnoble.com/\" target=\"_new\">ebooks.barnesandnoble.com</a> <br> <strong> Tome Raider</strong> <br> <a href=\"http://www.tomeraider.com  \">www.tomeraider.com</a></p> <p><strong> Top twenty downloads</strong><br> </p> <p> Author Title </p> <p><strong> Aesop</strong> Fables 2,103 <br> <strong> Wells </strong> War of the Worlds 1,701 <br> <strong> Darwin </strong> Origin of Species 1,404 <br> <strong> Carroll</strong> Alice in Wonderland (with illustrations) 1,345 <br> <strong> Carroll</strong> Alice in Wonderland (without illustrations) 1,294 <br> Beowulf 1,179  <strong> Franklin</strong> Autobiography 1,170 <br> <strong> Shakespeare</strong> Macbeth 1,107 <br> <strong> Verne</strong> Around the World in Eighty Days 1,033 <br> <strong> Irving</strong> The Legend of Sleepy Hollow 1,019 <br> <strong> Doyle</strong> The Hound of the Baskervilles 992 <br> <strong> Melville</strong> Moby Dick 985 <br> <strong> Twain</strong> Huckleberry Finn 978 <br> <strong> Shelley</strong> Frankenstein 922 <br> <strong> Wells</strong> The Time Machine 866 <br> <strong> Frost</strong> Group of Four Poems 858<br> <strong> Baum</strong> Marvelous Land of Oz (with illustrations) 854 <br>  <strong> Carroll</strong> Through the Looking Glass 843 <br> <strong> Milton</strong> Paradise Lost (1667 edition) 835 <br> <strong> Coleridge</strong> Rime of the Ancient Mariner 830 <br> <strong> Advantages of e-books</strong><br> </p> <p><strong>Advantages of e-books</strong><br> E-books cost nothing to duplicate, they are easy to customise, and they can be delivered almost anywhere in the world in seconds.

  "Gordon Brown is not the hair-shirted ascetic he is often painted. Street-wise would probably be going too far. But if he is now all ears to the the hauliers, it is a welcome sign of a politician who understands the need to act when the time is ripe. Those around him who have been ramping up divisions with Number 10 should be told to keep their hands off this one. Spinning is dangerous, stoking expectations of a sharp and immediate cut in the cost of using the roads for the aggrieved groups of September's protest. The pre-budget statement is less a constitutional document than a wish list. Mr Brown can use it to palliate without committing himself in detail. But he must also clearly articulate principles, such as the planetary necessity of taxing non- renewable fuel consumption. <p>Indeed Dunfermline's dour man must not be too generous. The real cost of motoring has been stable for decades - taking into account cost of buying vehicles, insurance and the rest. The case for making it cheaper, Opec notwithstanding, has not been made. The road haulage industry faces structural problems. It may have too many small contractors. Mr Brown will want to distinguish tax on vehicle ownership from taxing con sumption through the fuel duty. He will hesitate to increase the subsidy to people who happen to live in the \"country\". There are tried and tested measures of sparsity which might, conceivably, be used as the basis for helping far-flung road users. John Prescott has a brand new index of social deprivation. It plainly shows the poor live in cities; a chancellor, rightly concerned in his pensions policy to help the neediest most, should not forget that demographic fact. </p> <p>Mr Brown has the resources for a two-pronged attack on the genuine causes of September's discontents. The Tory proposal to cut 3p per litre off fuel duty would save a motorist doing 5,000 miles a year the princely sum of \u00a318. The Treasury could instead cut \u00a350 off vehicle excise duty for cars with engines smaller than 1800cc - at one and the same time doing his duty by the environment and benefiting drivers who tend to be older and living in rural districts on moderate incomes. The public's unwillingness to do the basic arithmetic of their car use would make it hard to sell such a policy. But his room for fiscal manoeuvre is wide and deep, as long as perky inflation figures do not give the Bank of England cause for interest rate concern.</p>",
  "<p>Using an aerial, a lightning conductor, a floppy disk and a microwave transceiver little bigger than a credit card, a pair of techies are hoping to beat the world's big telecommunication companies and launch the first broadband wireless internet in the UK. </p> <p>James Stevens and Julian Priest of <a href=\"http://www.Consume.net\" target=\"_new\">Consume.net</a> represent a growing group of people who believe that the internet should be as free as the air we breath - and they are planning to make it so. </p> <p>Everyone, they say, should have the right to access to the internet because the net is too valuable a thing to be owned by small groups of organisations, ie the big telecommunications companies. They believe that the network should be owned by its users, and it should be free. The current economic and regulatory framework is too slow, they say, and too expensive and is the cause of what is now being called the \"digital divide\". </p> <p>The scheme will be piloted later this month in Shoreditch, east London. It involves the creation of a \"data cloud\" - a wireless internet network distributed through the radio spectrum. The technology is already commercially available and, as long as the network is used for non-commercial basis, no licences will be needed, say the pair. </p> <p>Stevens says: \"We have already established three sites for antennas or nodes - which are omnidirectional send and receive stations. Once people have the wireless cards in their laptops they will be able to connect with our networks.\" These first three nodes, adds Stevens, are enough to generate a data cloud. The right cards for laptops are called 802.11 or wireless Ethernet and are available from companies like Lucent Technologies for as little as \u00a3150. </p> <p>Of course, the pair cannot build a network on their own. So last month they invited others to participate in its building and design. The response so far has been promising. Nearly 400 have already joined the mailing list. These include the chief executive of a leading UK internet service provider (ISP) and several high-end technologists. Already, another node is being developed in north London, and Medium Rare is building its own at London Bridge. The pair say that anyone can set up a node and that it can cost as little as \u00a3350. </p> <p>The initial nodes will rely on connections to the \"outside\" internet - which will still have to be paid for. But the pair see no reason why the network cannot stand alone once it has grown big enough. </p> <p>The idea for the network began in 1995. Then, Stevens had just co-founded Lateral, one of the UK's first web design agencies. Lateral was leasing a two megabyte connection from a business park in north London at a cost of \u00a3200,000 a year. Stevens found that he was using a mere quarter of the bandwidth and wanted to redistribute the spare capacity to the other creative groups in his neighborhood. One of those groups was web designer, Medium Rare, whose technical director is Julian Priest. </p> <p>The trouble was that they were housed in the building opposite and it is illegal to string a cable across a street in the UK. </p> <p>So, Priest went out and bought a pair of microwave transponders for \u00a3300, similar to those found in mobile phones, and hooked up to Lateral's bandwidth with a wireless connection. The pair say that the idea for a city-wide network came from there. </p> <p>\"The whole environment of communications is very tightly controlled. Because that's where the power is, especially these days,\" says Priest. \"That's the reason why we couldn't hang a wire across the street. </p> <p>\"The good thing about what we are doing now is that you don't need planning permission to build our network. And you don't need a licence.\" This is because they plan to operate on the part of the radio spec trum usually used by CB enthusiasts. </p> <p>The data cloud, they say, is not the internet for free, but the internet in return for participation. Although the protocols are still to be thrashed out, they will give access only to those prepared to build a node. The nodes work by both transmitting and receiving large amounts of data. This means that those participating in the creation of the data cloud are effectively sharing bandwidth. So, although technically feasible, simply buying the correct PC card will not be enough. </p> <p>Beyond that, the group hopes to connect local networks and get backbones between local networks running under their own rules. Similar networks are already under way in Sweden and the US. Consume is constructing a legal framework that will be built into its software that will define how resources should be shared, \"both inside and outside the network\", says Stevens. </p> <p>To Stevens in particular - who for years ran Backspace, the UK's first digital access space - the point of all this is to allow people to produce their own media. </p> <p>\"This has been possible for some time,\" he says. \"But the missing link has always been issue of connectivity. It is easy to stream media between two people, but to stream to 10 people is already beyond the bandwidth of most users. So we have stepped in to give people the idea that it is within their own capabilities to develop a network of their own.\" </p> <p>It was because of this desire that they got fed up waiting for the big telcos to get their wireless networks together. Also, the government's auction of bandwidth has driven the price up to a point where any successful bidder will have to make so much money out of it that the chances of a fast cheap public access network emerging are virtually nil. At no point do they ever mention the desire to make any money from Consume - they operate as a strictly non-profit making organisation. </p> <p>\"We are just trying to build in the scraps of what's left,\" says Priest. \"But we believe that there is more than enough. And if we can populate the space with free public access networks - then we might even provide some competition for the big telecommunications companies.\"</p>",
  "<p>Life-threatening levels of flooding cut a swathe across southern England this morning after a reported deluge of up to six inches of rain last night.</p> <p>A man was plucked to safety from fast-flowing floodwaters early today after torrential rain inundated hundreds of homes and caused traffic chaos.</p> <p>The night of unceasing rain left much of east and west Sussex under water and several main roads impassable. </p> <p>Police said the man had been swept away by floodwater outside Somerfield's store in High Street, Uckfield, east Sussex, shortly before 7.20am.

  "<p>Tony Salter, chief executive of Boxman.com, yesterday warned that his online CD retailing company had less than two weeks to find a purchaser or face oblivion. </p> <p>A creditors' meeting will be called for the week beginning October 23 after the Boxman website was shut down on Monday night and trading halted. Approval will be sought at the meeting to put the company into voluntary liquidation. </p> <p>Mr Salter is already in advanced discussions with one venture capital group in his attempts to raise \u00a320m.

Bernard Arnault, from French luxury goods group LVMH, was an investor and Alain Levy, a former chief executive of PolyGram, was a non-executive director. </p> <p>Boxman was recenly supported by some notable blue chip institutions such as ABN Amro, GE Europe and Lehman Brothers. </p> <p>Formed in 1997, the company forged a groundbreaking cross-promotion deal with music video channel MTV and merged with British online home entertainment group iMVS.com. </p> <p>But in May it was forced to abandon a \u00a3300m London stock market flotation as the climate for technology stocks cooled. </p> <p>The 120 Boxman staff - including 40 in Abingdon, Oxfordshire - were informed by managers yesterday of the seriousness facing the competitor of Amazon.com and BOL.com. </p> <p>The start-up, which has operating companies inBritain, Holland and Sweden, was spending between \u00a31m and \u00a32m a month and had failed to pull off a new cash-raising exercise with its financial adviser, Lehman Brothers. </p> <p>The group attracted 750,000 customers and had turnover of \u00a35.8m in the first half of the year but losses had were more than \u00a324m over the same period. </p> <p>Mr Bradshaw said it did not matter how well managed a venture was. The crucial factor was to be number one or number two in the chosen field of operation - or to have tremendously deep pockets courtesy of one really big investor. \"This is a winner takes all environment.\"</p> <p>\u0095 <strong> Going down, the failures </strong></p> <p>This year has been a grim one for the internet fraternity; the problems at <strong> Boxman.com </strong> are just the latest. </p> <p>While sports fashion e-tailer <strong> Boo.com </strong> made the biggest headlines when it ceased trading in May, there have been others since. </p> <p>Earlier this month <strong> Powernet Telecom</strong>, the internet company chaired by the Marquess of Huntly, was forced into receivership with debts of \u00a330m. </p> <p>Before this, <strong> Callnet</strong>, the internet service provider, went into administration and was forced to bring in BDO Stoy Hayward to try to find a trade buyer. </p> <p><strong> Leisureplanet.com</strong>, a travel site, went the same way and <strong> Clickmango</strong>, the health e-tailer, was forced to cease trading earlier this year. </p> <p>Even ventures with heavyweight support have found the going hard. <strong> Efdex</strong>, backed by IBM and Dell, closed its UK arm and despite Disney backing <strong> Toysmart.com</strong> fell by the wayside.</p>",
  "Things, as they are fond of saying in the east end, are not what they used to be. Not even a Kray funeral. Reggie Kray, the last of the notorious family line, was buried yesterday but the event was a shadow of the send-offs afforded to his mother and brothers before him. <p>No more than 2,500 people turned out to watch the gangster's last trip down the Bethnal Green Road yesterday morning, and the gawpers would have been disappointed by the mourners. The official party was notable more for who was not there than who was. It would have been impressive for an ordinary east end lad perhaps, but not for a Kray. It was a limp end to the legend. </p> <p>When the twins' mother, Violet, made the same trip in 1982 it is said more than 60,000 people lined the route from undertakers W English &amp; Son to St Matthew's church little more than a mile away; in 1995 when Ronnie was buried similar numbers turned up. Even brother Charlie, whose reputation was far less fearsome than his younger brothers', drew a five figure crowd earlier this year. But each of those occasions had something this by its very nature did not: a real live Kray to look at. </p> <p>Outside English &amp; Son at 10am, as scores of wreaths were delivered including one from from EastEnders' Barbara Windsor, it seemed the mourners might be outnumbered by the security. </p> <p>With police keeping a discreet distance, about 100 burly men in dark suits, dark glasses and gold chains cleared a path from the chapel of rest to the horse drawn coach in which Kray's coffin was to be carried. It looked more like a doormen's convention than a funeral. Each wore a red badge bearing the initals RKF (Reggie Kray Funeral), and a red armband. </p> <p>\"They symbolise all the blood and tears that have been spilt over the years,\" said the head of security, Richard Grayston. \"Today is the end of an era, when we close the chapter. I think this is the end of the whole Kray illusion.\" </p> <p>Behind the cordon ageing men greeted old acquaintances and swapped stories of failing health and dimly remembered days when the brothers were free. Many of them would once have gone by the euphemistic description \"associate of the Krays\", but the watching crowds, now swelling, struggled to put names to faces. </p> <p>This was no surprise. The celebrities the Krays had assiduously courted in their pomp were largely absent although Stephen Berkoff, who played Ronnie's victim George Cornell in the film The Krays, was there. He spoke of the twins performing \"a mythic service in a dull, dreary post-war environment\", and providing \"a sense of colour and identity\". </p> <p>Also absent were some of the gangsters with whom the Krays stood trial, men who did time for crimes committed on the brothers' behalf. Freddy Foreman, who admitted killing Frank \"The Axeman\" Mitchell at the Krays' request, was absent, as was Tony Lambrianou who cleaned up the mess after Reggie had stabbed Jack \"The Hat\" McVitie to death in a flat in Stoke Newington. </p> <p>Both stayed away after Roberta Kray, who married Reggie three years ago in Wayland prison, Norfolk, declared it was not to be a day for grandstanding by men from Reggie's past. Perhaps the twins, with their respect for strong women, would have approved. </p> <p>Foreman had visited Kray on his death bed a week ago and left thinking that he was to be a pall bearer. Roberta, however, chose four friends from Reggie's latter years and Foreman stayed away. Two of them, Bradley Allardyce, an armed robber who shared a cell with Kray in Maidstone prison, and Tony Mortimer, former singer of East 17, were not even born when the Krays went down in 1968. </p> <p>The service at St Matthew's was also dominated by characters from his last days, and focused on Kray the reformed Christian, not the hoodlum who stabbed McVitie so ferociously his liver fell out. </p> <p>Kray's solicitor, Mark Goldstein, gave an address. \"I had first hand knowledge of his generosity. Reg was an icon of the 20th century,\" he said, before the coffin left the church to Frank Sinatra's My Way. </p> <p>Back on the Bethnal Green Road, as the cortege of 18 hearses began the journey to the family plot in Chingford cemetery, opinions were mixed as to the significance of the day. One shopkeeper, a Pakistani who moved to the east end two years ago, said he did not understand the fuss. \"I have seen the film though,\" he said. Edward Peek, 82, had nothing but regrets. \"He was a nice man, he'd help anyone. May he rest in peace,\" he said. </p> <p>At the cemetery a planned flypast by a Spitfire failed to happen. Sam Glazebrook and his pal David Kerr, both 16, had bunked off school in Ruislip, Middlesex, to be there. </p> <p>\"He is an idol. He stood for good morals. There were nasty things too but I think he was a good man who was misunderstood,\" said Sam, adding that he thought the streets were safer when Reggie was free, too. The last of the Krays may be dead, but there is some life in the old myth yet.</p>",
  "A story is making the rounds in US politics of a tycoon who decided to invest in a dog food company. He hired the top market research people, the best packaging experts, a front-rank media firm and a highly regarded public relations company. <p>After spending tens of millions, however, sales were dismal. Gathering his minions together, he demanded to know why his investment was not paying off. \"The dogs won't eat the food,\" the promotional team concluded. </p> <p>This is Al Gore's problem. No matter how his speechwriters, image consultants, issue experts and pollsters package him, the US people just don't like Al Gore. They do not want to spend the next four years listening to his lectures, tolerating his patronising attitude or watching his pious posturing. If the president is going, constantly, to be in our face, Americans figure, let him be, at the very least, appealing. </p> <p>Al Gore comes across as the teacher's pet - the earnest, fresh faced boy in the class who always has the right answer. The teacher loves him and the other students hate the sight of him. </p> <p>A curious dichotomy emerged in the reactions to the first Gore-Bush debate. The experts - myself included - watched the ebb and flow of the arguments and concluded that Mr Gore had won, decisively. He out-debated his inarticulate rival, scoring point after point, aiming his shots with precision. Mr Bush seemed to flounder, unable to respond effectively. To us it was a knockout. </p> <p>But the public saw it differently. After an initial round of polls indicating Mr Gore had \"won\", Mr Bush began to move ahead smartly. As evidence mounted that the Democrat had misrepresented his role in meting out sympathy to flood victims in Texas and had exaggerated the extent of overcrowding in a Florida school, voters turned away from Mr Gore. </p> <p>By the week's end, the CNN-Gallup poll showed Mr Bush pushing above 50%. </p> <p>The issues clearly work for Mr Gore. Few disagree that he could best handle problems such as gun control, the environment and poverty. Even on issues the GOP (Grand Old Party) contests, such as education and healthcare, Mr Gore wins decisively in most polls. </p> <p>Public enthusiasm for Mr Bush's tax cuts is sharply limited, and most identify with Mr Gore's spending priorities - eliminating the national debt and solidifying the fiscal basis for social security and Medicare. </p> <p>So why don't Americans vote for Mr Gore? Because they just do not like him. </p> <p>With the differences between the candidates so narrow, Americans feel at liberty to indulge their affections rather than their ideology in casting their votes. </p> <p>While some voters speak of Mr Bush's superior character, most just frankly admit that they like him. They like his cockeyed grin, his torturous English, his sense of himself, his willingness to be human. </p> <p>Mr Gore seems too anxious to please and too willing to lie. He said he invented the internet, founded the strategic petroleum reserve and worked on his farm in Tennessee. He was shot at in Vietnam. His marriage was the model for the film Love Story. His mother sang a union song as a lullaby. His mother-in-law pays more for her medicine than for her dog's. As a crusading journalist, his stories sent politicians to jail. </p> <p>All appealing anecdotes. But all are untrue. </p> <p>The harmless quality of his Walter Mitty inventions only serve to remind Americans that Mr Gore is artificial. Reared as the son of a senator in a Washington hotel room he called home, Mr Gore is like the baby born in a bubble to limit his exposure to the germs other people carry. </p> <p>With issues counting for little and the country doing fine, distinctions of character and personality become the fulcrum for the election. </p> <p>Ironically, the success of Bill Clinton and Al Gore has paved the way for George W Bush. </p> <p>\u0095 Dick Morris was chief strategist for President Clinton in his successful 1996 re-election campaign.

  "<p><strong>Time to sell has gone - as usual</strong></p> <p>Remember all those gold rush analogies, where investors in the new economy were warned that the man supplying the shovels was always going to make more money than those doing the digging? Well, yesterday there were worrying signs that, in an internet infrastructure sense, the handle might be coming adrift from the blade. </p> <p>Both diggers and shovel-sellers took the brunt of the stock market's irritation as Lucent, the big US networking specialist, and mobile maker Motorola became the latest internet darlings to warn that the hills of the new economy are not quite as rich as first thought. </p> <p>At moments like this it is worth remembering the Twelve Choruses of a Market Cycle, as identified by the American financial author John Train. * </p> <p>1. The Washout or Selling Climax: \"Stocks are going way down.\" </p> <p>2. The Early Surge: \"Things look better, but its too early to buy.\" </p> <p>3.The Surge Continues: \"Prices seem high. It's too late to buy.\" </p> <p>4. The Second Stage of the Rocket: \"Maybe it's ok to buy.\" </p> <p>5. Not a Cloud in the Sky: \"Buy!\" </p> <p>6. The Blowoff: \"Stocks can only go up.\" </p> <p>7. Coasting: \"The market is high, but this time is different.\" </p> <p>8. The Top: \"Hold.\" </p> <p>9. Over the Hump: \"It's too soon to sell.\" </p> <p>10. The Slide: \"Prices are cheap, but it's too late to sell.\" </p> <p>11. \"It's OK to sell.\" </p> <p>12. The Cascade: \"Sell!\" </p> <p>Anyone with half an eye on the London market over the past 12 months will see how Train's pop-analysis fits. </p> <p>On November 4 last year, the Stock Exchange launched its new-fangled TechMark 100 index, designed to give fresh focus to companies with high growth potential. Retail investors went wild and the TechMark surged 45% in the space of eight weeks. </p> <p>The market was singing Chorus 5. Business news was excellent, jazzy investment vehicles, such as internet incubators, were springing up all over the place. A particular area of the market had become manic, with prices quickly bid up to irrational levels. </p> <p>By Christmas, the market had moved on to Chorus 6. To quote Train, writing five years earlier: \"Hot managers become famous. Young, glib, impatient of conventional wisdom, they collect huge sums from trustful greedy investors hoping for miracles. They chase new themes as a pack.\" </p> <p>The early months of this year epitomised Chorus 7 - business starts to peak, but a conviction has already developed that the business cycle has been mastered. Market operators manufacture stock to feed quacking investors. </p> <p>The top, Chorus 8, was clearly reached at the beginning of March when the TechMark 100 stood at 5743, up 135% in four months. The intervening months, during which the TechMark has lost close to 40% of its value, have probably seen us through 9 and 10 - \"It's too soon to sell\" and \"It's too late to sell.\" </p> <p>So there has to be a risk now that we are heading for the final choruses. </p> <p>11: \"Often some extrinsic event punctures the balloon, such as a stunning major bankruptcy,\" Train writes. \"After a while we may see a severe decline...[but] there is often a powerful deceptive rally, which one might call a 'trap rally'.\" </p> <p>12: \"Now the river sweeps over the brink, carrying everything with it. A cardinal point of market strategy, if one is a trader at all, is to get out before this cascade...\" </p> <p>*Global Guide to Investing, edited by James Morton, Pitman Publishing. </p> <p><strong> Go gure </strong><br> </p> <p>A \u00a3400m hole, and how to fill it. This is the problem the government faces as a result of its logical plan to update the way social security is paid in the 21st century. Out goes grubby old cash, in comes payment through bank accounts. </p> <p>In the process, beleaguered post office masters and mistresses lose a combined \u00a3400m in business. At the same time the government faces another irritation: how to pay benefits to 3m claimants who do not have bank accounts at all? </p> <p>This so-called \"financial exclusion\" dilemma was being tackled by the Treasury, which had ordered the banks to set up basic bank accounts, without overdrafts, to reach the \"unbanked\". The banks, who like rich customers rather than poor ones, are now even more annoyed by the plan for the universal bank which they believe duplicates these efforts inside the Post Office. </p> <p>Profits and costs are the only thing banks care about, however much they might protest publicly. At the very least it looks as if they will have to pay out \u00a3130m annually, through what many regard as a recurring windfall tax. </p> <p>It is hard to sympathise with a sector making billions in profits, but the figures are hazy and the calculations a mystery. It is time everyone, including bank shareholders, was told how they were reached and when they might diminish.</p>",
  "Perhaps it was his way with the overhead projector, the quaint leather patches on his brown corduroy jacket. Or maybe it was how she scribbled her notes so furiously into her spiral-bound notebook. The relationship between university tutor and student is a delicately poised one. <p>Tuesday saw the acquittal of one Russell Griffiths, a 36-year-old lecturer who had been accused of drugging and raping one of his 18-year-old students when he was working at the University of Lincoln and Humberside two years ago. The jury was prevented from hearing of a book kept by Griffiths, telling of his sexual exploits. The student in question was number 84, of a total of 90 women. </p> <p>This case was exceptional. Griffiths is a man with previous criminal convictions, all of which involved obsessive behaviour towards women. In his \"little black book\", he gave explicit details of his sexual encounters with women, rating them out of 10 under categories such as BT (Best Technique) and BF (Best Feature). Summing up, Judge Richard Pollard described Griffiths' actions as \"unattractive, repellent and disgusting\". </p> <p>Sex and students are synonymous. Roving hands groping the breast, the knee, the buttocks of some unwitting 18-year-old happen every Friday night on the crowded dance floor of a Ritzy's near you. They come with the territory of student life and the cheap offers on Carlsberg. But sherry-soaked lurches in the faculty library are a different matter. </p> <p>University is a time of exploring one's own identity away from the family unit. The proud gaze of your mother no longer follows you; she is not there to disapprove of the state of your bedroom or your latest beau. For many, this is a time of sexual experimentation. A survey of male students at Cambridge University found that two-thirds were virgins at the start of their degrees, but only one-third had not tried sex by the time they had completed their finals. </p> <p>For the herd of 18- and 19-year-olds who scramble, colt-legged and wet-nosed, into our universities each autumn term, the student room, small and grotty, is often the first of their own. There is a pervading smell of toast. The walls are thin and speckled with greasy Blu-Tack marks; your spider plant is half-dead and a pair of cheap brown curtains mope around the window frame. You keep your milk outside on the windowsill, swathed in a Tesco carrier bag, and a packet of Durex Featherlite under your lumpy mattress, in the half-hope, half-fear that you might get lucky. </p> <p>For the first time in your life, you can get up and go to bed whenever they like. More importantly, you can drag home whoever you choose in the wee small hours, to fumble and frolic in a creaking, narrow bed. </p> <p>A sexual frisson between students and tutors is almost inevitable. The tutor can become a parent substitute: the elder figure to whom a student will always defer, the central person in her life, whom she strives to impress and to please with her academic efforts. Intellectual sparring can fast develop into a form of flirtation. </p> <p>Verity Coyle, president of the student union at the University of Lincoln and Humberside, where Griffiths used to teach, confirms that the lecturer is a \"glamorised\" figure, almost guru-like in his appeal to female students. By comparison, their male peers seem immature and inexperienced. Any kind of sexual approach made by the tutor is unlikely to be rejected, she says. </p> <p>For the tutor, it is flattering to be feted by his young female students. But Coyle believes it is up to him to resist. \"The responsibility should always be with the lecturer to draw the line,\" she says. He is, after all, in the position of authority. But she hopes cases such as that of Griffiths and recent allegations at Edinburgh University, where a reader in social anthropology has been charged with sexual harassment of female students, will not discourage tutors from holding one-to-one tutorials. </p> <p>In 1995, Pam Carter and Tony Jeffs of the University of Northumbria published a study entitled A Very Private Affair - Sexual Exploitation in Higher Education. Several years spent interviewing university officials and students revealed a profile of the \"serial exploiter\" - a heterosexual male tutor, frequently lecturing in arts subjects, who makes inappropriate passes at his female students. </p> <p>The most concerning outcome of the report was that such incidents are likely to be brushed deftly under the carpet. University authorities do not wish to receive the adverse publicity a sexual harassment case might bring, nor do they wish to lose an eminent academic from their staff. </p> <p>University officials continually told Carter and Jeffs that students were adults, responsible for their own sexual behaviour. David Melhuish of the Association of University Teachers (AUT) agrees. \"This is not the sort of substitute parent relationship you get in schools. The students are adults.\" The AUT's own guidelines stress that there should not be any \"potential perceived impropriety\" in a student-tutor relationship. A tutor should not be \"perceived as having a relationship with a student\", as this could have grave professional repercussions. </p> <p>Melhuish concedes that the kind of contact that occurs between students and teachers in a university environment makes incidents of sexual entanglement more likely. \"Tutorials bring together varying ages and outlooks which might not otherwise meet,\" he says. However, he does not believe that it is ultimately the responsibility of the AUT to advise on such matters, other than in a professional capacity. \"It is not for us to tell members how to conduct their personal lives.\" </p> <p>Peter Lang, senior lecturer at the Institute of Education at Warwick, believes there should be escape mechanisms for tutors who do become overly involved with a student. The line may easily be crossed, he points out: \"If a student breaks down in tears before you, it is an instinctive response to put your arms around her.\" </p> <p>He believes personal tutors in particular require special training to deal with such emotionally charged situations. At Warwick, a tutor can approach his head of department with any concerns regarding conduct. It may simply be the case that it is deemed inappropriate for the tutor to mark a particular student's work - but the key factor is that the relationship, however trivial, should be dealt with openly. Lang himself met his wife when he was a tutor for the Open University and she a student, albeit of another tutor. </p> <p>The unnamed student at the University of Lincoln and Humberside is continuing with her studies at the university. Verity Coyle stresses that she is immensely proud of the girl. \"She didn't do that well in her A-levels,\" she says, \"so going to uni took courage in itself.\" </p> <p>As exceptional as the Griffiths case is, wherever questions of power, responsibility and attraction meet, there will inevitably be problems. The student-lecturer relationship is complex and it is a fine line between hero-worship and exploitation.</p>",

  "<p> It would seem common sense that a malnourished foetus may have problems in later life. But could that individual be better off if it stays poorly nourished? </p> <p> This controversial theory may be the key to preventing the type of diabetes that can develop in middle age. Textbooks say that whether or not you develop type II diabetes depends in part on which genes you inherit and in part on environmentalfactors such as obesity. </p> <p> But Nick Hales, professor of clinical biochemistry at Cambridge University thinks it is \"your early development, in addition to obesity, that determines your risk of developing the disease\". Twelve years ago he was studying a clear link between obesity and type II diabetes, when he met David Barker, professor of clinical epidemiology at Southampton University. </p> <p> \"David was investigating whether heart and blood pressure problems might be due to poor foetal growth. We discussed mechanisms that might explain this and wondered whether they might also apply to type II diabetes.\" The hormone insulin lets your body remove glucose, produced as food is digested, from your bloodstream. With type II diabetes you do not produce sufficient insulin, nor can you use it effectively. As glucose builds up in your blood, symptoms range from tiredness and weight loss, to kidney failure, heart attacks and blindness. </p> <p> Insulin is made by cells in your pancreas which normally grow very quickly during foetal life. The scientists reasoned that if your foetal food supply is poor then you might have fewer of these cells and not be able to produce sufficient insulin so diabetes will result. Their initial approach was crude but informative.</p> <p> They looked at birth-weight records for 60-80 year olds in Hertfordshire, Preston and Sheffield and found those with a low birthweight were more likely to develop type II diabetes, especially if they had become obese in later life. Hales's team fed pregnant rats either a normal diet or one with half the normal protein. Malnourished mothers gave birth to small malnourished babies and normally-nourished mothers gave birth to normally-nourished babies. Then malnourished babies were suckled by the normally-nourished foster mothers, and vice versa. The malnourished babies suckled by normal foster mothers were, by weaning, the same weight as babies who had never been malnourished. But these foster babies, espe cially the males, died younger, than normal babies who, suckled by malnourished foster mothers, had been poorly nourished during this stage. </p> <p> \"A pregnant mother who is malnourished communicates this to her baby and the foetus adapts to its food shortage by growing in a different way,\" says Hales.</p> <p> \"Somehow, maybe by a change in the bloodstream, nutrients are diverted to essential organs like the brain and lung, since if you have a smaller kidney, pancreas or liver, it's not that critical in the short-term. The problem is that these adaptations by the food starved organs permanently alter their development and the way they will function in later life.\" A pancreas optimised for a poor nutritional environment will have no problem if food continues to be sparse after birth. In sub-Saharan Africa birthweight is low, but glucose tolerance is high and diabetes is almost non-existent. Hales believes this is because such infants, if malnourished before birth, are also likely to be poorly nourished after birth and so never catch-up. </p> <p> Obesity among adult sub-Saharans is also rare. In the west in contrast, although a foetus may be malnourished due to problems during pregnancy, food is usually abundant post-birth and so a pancreas developed to be \"thrifty\" will be traumatised. \"Our big question is if a baby born malnourished then receives many nutrients, will this make it more prone to diabetes in later life, especially if it also becomes obese?\" says Hales. </p> <p> \"We don't want to scare mothers who have had small babies and experienced health visitors with the traditional 'stuff-'em till they burst' approach to feeding. Rats do mimic the human situation in some ways. Like male baby rats, human male babies with low birth-weights undergo faster growth than female babies born with a low birth-weight. Male rats also die younger then female rats, just like men generally die younger than women. But until we do more human trials we cannot say for sure whether such catch-up growth is detrimental to long-term health in humans as it is in the rat.\" </p> <p> This will be discussed in February as part of aninternational conference which has caught the interest of the World Health Organisation and the World Bank More than 100 million people world wide have type II diabetes and for every one known case it is estimated that there is one unknown. In the UK it affects 2% of people, but accounts for 5% of health service spending. </p> <p> \"Ideally, there needs to be a whole change in emphasis so women and especially pregnant women are at the start of the food chain,\" says Hales. But it is easier and cheaper, with environmental theories rather than genetic ones, to change a situation and improve health. Which is why WHO and the World Bank are interested. </p> <p>\u0095 Natasha McDowell is a molecular biologist at Cambridge</p>",
  "<p><strong> Remember</strong><br> Since Blair Witch showed us how far the net could be used as a marketing tool, film trailers have been getting curiouser and curiouser. </p> <p>The latest addition is the thriller Memento (See <a href=\"http://www.otnemem.com\" target=\"_new\">www.otnemem.com</a>), released in the UK next week. Directed by Christopher Nolan and co-written by brother Jonathan, the film is an elliptical murder mystery that has won rave reviews in the US. </p> <p>The site, designed by the brothers, includes scraps of evidence that are not in the film. The website revolves around a newspaper article detailing the grizzly murder of a character in the film. But roll over certain key words and fragments of evidence are then revealed.

  "<p>There are five bedrooms (three with sea views), three bathrooms, a steam room, four turrets and a three acre garden part bordered by craggy cliffs and wild clover. It is light and airy, warm and comforting. It is my castle in the air, far removed from the two- bedroom basement flat we can afford. </p> <p>Searching for a property is never easy, especially when ideals do not compare with reality. In London, space is the ultimate luxury and a snatch of greenery is the diamond carrot for financially stretched buyers. In this environment, bargains are snapped up before house details are even printed so it pays to either befriend an estate agent or look online. </p> <p>Warned by Stephen Fry about estate agents - who \"with their jangling keys, nasty suits, revolting beards, moustaches and tinted spectacles, roam the land causing perturbation and despair\" - I turned to my computer. </p> <p>Property sites are a booming, gazumping business online. As the new property databases with their virtual tours and vast range of properties propagate, so too have the estate agents produced hi-tech sites of their own to entice their customers back. </p> <p>An even greater risk to the estate agents are the dot.com property companies who often charge zero commission and are beginning to get a foothold in the industry. Progress may be slow but Rome wasn't built in a day and a house is rarely found in a week. </p> <p>I began my own search at <a href=\"http://www.findaproperty.com\">www.findaproperty.com</a> which is a database of properties from several estate agents, both large and small. Simple to use (just key in ideal prices, number of bedrooms and postcodes), it comes up with a list of properties matching your description. If you find something you like, you can email your interest directly to the estate agent involved. For all the wonders of modern technology, only one in six responded so it is often best to contact them by phone. </p> <p>The site also gave excellent local information, council tax prices, comments from residents and virtual tours. These tours allow you to see into the home using panoramic imagery which can really test estate agent speak (\"funky\" meaning \"ghastly paintwork\" and \"light and airy\" meaning \"one window in the basement\"). </p> <p>Other good sites are <a href=\"http://www.assertahome.com\">www.assertahome.com</a> - it has a change of address service and online applications for new utilities - and <a href=\"http://www.08004homes.com\">www.08004homes.com</a> (with online interior design magazine). <a href=\"http://www.propertylive.co.uk\">www.propertylive.co.uk</a> also provides information on buying and selling a home. </p> <p>According to Tim, one of that rare breed of nice estate agents, properties are updated every week on the internet so the chances of finding a home still for sale are much higher there than from the colour brochures that come through your letterbox - these are often a month out of date. </p> <p>Vendors and buyers can avoid agents altogether with sites such as <a href=\"http://www.loot.co.uk\">www.loot.co.uk</a>,, <a href=\"http://www.linkupproperties.co.uk\">www.linkupproperties.co.uk</a> and <a href=\"http://www.easier.co.uk\">www.easier.co.uk</a>. These charge vendors a small sum to advertise but are free to buyers. You can search for a property then email your interest and details to the seller who will then contact you direct. Some sites allow you to contact the sellers direct. </p> <p>Some even price their properties a little more competitively since they will be saving on estate agency fees. These are a useful resource if you are not in a rush to buy. Most sites require registration. </p> <p>At <a href=\"http://www.auctions.co.uk/\">www.auctions.co.uk</a> property/ there is a list of forthcoming property auctions. You can request brochures online and subsequently view a property in your desired area and price range. It is important to have cash up front and know your prices. We met a lot of professional \"auction buyers\" who intimidated us with their shiny grey suits and patronising manner. I am still seeking a website that teaches you how to deal with such individuals. </p> <p>My castle in the air proved to be a subterranean flat. Dark in places with the odd whiff of mildew, but it felt like home. After a thrilling sealed bid where the advice of sites such as <a href=\"http://www.findaproperty.com\">www.findaproperty.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.propertylive.co.uk\">www.propertylive.co.uk</a> was useful in understanding procedures and competitive prices, we started the next stage: looking for a mortgage. </p> <p>Mortgage advisers are another strange breed with their peculiar passion for all things numerical. The potential embarrassment of exposing my knowledge of figures had me reaching for my mouse and looking online. I went straight to my home page and linked through to <a href=\"http://www.charcoalonline.com\">www.charcoalonline.com</a> where a mortgage wizard takes you through a series of relevant questions to help find your ideal mortgage before calculating the cost. </p> <p>The site does offer special deals but it is useful to have some kind of prior knowledge to get what you want. I did my background research at <a href=\"http://www.mortgages-online.co.uk\">www.mortgages-online.co.uk</a> , which offers an excellent guide to most kinds of mortgages. We eventually found what we wanted at <a href=\"http://www.woolwich.co.uk\">www.woolwich.co.uk</a> which not only offers good (if biased) mortgage advice but also information and details about the very latest open plan, offset mortgages. </p> <p>With both property and mortgage secured, it was back to my castle in the air and to the ultimate property website, <a href=\"http://www.property.org.uk\">www.property.org.uk</a>. This is a daydreamer's paradise. Here you can buy a safari park in Kenya, a castle in Perth, floating homes in London and an island in Loch Lomond for only \u00a315,000. </p> <p>So, as I dream about turrets and ravaged coastlines; galloping through the savannah back to my homestead; watching the sun come down on the deck of my 60ft narrow boat, property prices continue to rise and estate agents continue to irritate. Or in the tempered words of Stephen Fry: \"There's only one thing worse than an estate agent but at least that can be safely lanced, drained and surgically dressed.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong> Anything goes in the marvel of Speedball</strong><br> <strong> Speedball 2100 </strong><br> Sony PlayStation \u00a329.99 Bitmap Brothers/ Empire Interactive *** <br> Back in the days when home computer meant Amiga or Atari, there was a future sport game that transcended its humble roots to become a benchmark for the genre. </p> <p>Speedball 2's violent mix of football and rollerball has retained its visceral excitement. And finally, 10 years on, the Bitmap Brothers have released an updated version for the PlayStation, and this time it's in 3D. </p> <p>Speedball has always been a simple game to pick up. Never mind tactics, timeouts and offside, the rules here are straightforward - get the ball in the goal more often than the opposition. Anything goes in the enclosed venue, with elbows flying and stretcher-bearers a crucial part of the team. Nevertheless, tactics are still important, with judicious use of the arena walls still joyously effective. </p> <p>Taking charge of the lowliest team, your aim is to win league and cup glory: a task made easier by the regular fine-tuning you can give your boys. Of course, the real excitement is in the two-player mode, with the satisfaction gained from pummelling a human opponent far greater than any artificial intelligence. </p> <p>Despite a decade of technological progress, the Amiga version actually looks better. The obligatory move to the third dimension means that Speedball 2100 just doesn't seem as clean as the original, even if you can now adjust the camera angle. There are also a number of control issues - from slowdown to player selection -that affect the smooth feel of the game. </p> <p>Despite these niggles, Speedball is a peerless future sports title. Whether the Fifa generation will appreciate an unlicensed game with a single button control method remains to be seen. (GH)</p> <p><strong> London without the Dome?</strong><br> <strong> Sim City 3000 UK Edition</strong> <br> Windows 95/98 \u00a334.99 Maxis/EA *** <br> The selling point of the latest edition of the long-running city construction series is that you can \"design, build and manage your own UK city in the first truly British Sim City\". But the title fails to deliver. </p> <p>Yes, you can have traffic driving on the left. However, you still have to put up with grid-style cities with more or less straight roads and overhead power lines and so on. The advisors still look American, and the city budgets are still calculated in dollars not pounds. </p> <p>New features include redwood forests and plagues of locusts. How British are those? </p> <p>As the small print on the box admits, this is really the SC3000 World Edition with an extra building set that looks reasonably British, but the details are totally swamped by the rest of the design. </p> <p>Loading the pre-prepared London, which takes an infuriating amount of time to render, reveals a Big Ben clock tower but no Houses of Parliament, no London Eye, and no Dome, though a remarkable number of suspension bridges span the Thames. </p> <p>Sim City is a terrific game - at least, it is with disasters turned off. But if you already have Sim City 3000 World Edition, you don't need this. (JS)</p> <p> <strong> Wrecking zombies just wears thin</strong><br> <strong> Carmegeddon TDR 2000</strong><br> PC CD-rom \u00a329.99 Torus/SCi ** <br> In Carmegeddon, you had to race round the streets of a nightmare urban future, mowing down zombies and turning opponents into scrapyard fodder. </p> <p>In Carmageddon 2, you had to do more of the same. Now, in a radical departure, Carmageddon TDR 2000 puts you in an altogether more benevolent world, where you drive courteously, blow kisses to fellow motorists and throw bunches of flowers at unhappy people. </p> <p>As if. No, it's zombies and wrecking again, and to be honest, it's all starting to wear a bit thin. </p> <p>The problem is that the few changes that have been implemented make little difference to gameplay. Sure, the physics engine may have been overhauled, but racing is no more enjoyable than before - the low-gravity environment makes it hellishly difficult to stay right side up. </p> <p>We are assured, also, that the graphics have been revamped; detachable car parts, though, hardly compensate for blurry zombies and insipid backgrounds. </p> <p>The hardcore dance soundtrack is way too close to WipeOut (which, chaps, came out in 1995), and the new mission-style levels interspersed with the standard races are repetitive, unimaginative, and even trickier to complete. </p> <p>One thing that CTDR2K can pride itself on is its improved multiplayer code, which should make online gaming simpler, quicker and more satisfying. Because other humans - as opposed to the infuriating artificial intelligence Schumachers programmed into the game - make far more rewarding competitors. (AB)</p>",
  "<p>The great Indian phenomenon is sweeping the world of information technology. Producing a rich resource of 68,000 computer software professionals every year, India has turned into a virtual incubator of infotech talents being wooed by the West. The country is touted as the next IT superpower in the making. </p> <p>The rush has begun in earnest. While the US government is set to increase its controversial H-1B visas from 115,000 to 200,000 next year targeting Indian geeks, Germany has opened its doors (so far rather unsuccessfully) to attract more techies. But not everything begins and ends with the great American dream. The other is a more dynamic tale of a booming software industry of which, apparently, the whole information techonolgy world wants to be a part. </p> <p>So as Bill Gates opens his next Microsoft R&amp;D centre in Hyderabad and NRI (non-resident Indian) funded technology startups make headline news every other day, Indian companies continue to grow rich by exporting low-cost software development services. </p> <p>According to India's National Association of Software and Service Companies (Nasscom), the country's software exports have increased from $734m in 1995 to $3.9bn in 1999-2000. It expects to reach an export level of $6.3bn by 2000-2001 and $9.5bn the following year. And the target set by the National IT Task Force is nothing short of $50bn in annual exports of software and services by 2008. </p> <p>Rajesh Srivastava, vice chairman, Silicon Valley Indian Professionals Association (SIPA) and president of Balcom Systems &amp; Technologies, believes that the Indian scene now could rightly be compared with the \"growing\" Silicon Valley of 1982. \"I feel that there is a great opportunity in India and that is why all large and medium scale companies in the world want to be a part of it,\" he says, pointing out that he also has an offshore development centre for networking and systems software at Noida industrial centre in northern India. </p> <p>Most of the 2,000 or so Silicon Valley Indian entrepreneurs engaged in the hi-tech industry have, like Srivastava, invested in India's software segment. The reasons he cites are cost effectiveness and lack of skilled personnel in the US. \"This is where India has the lead - availability of technical resources. Currently about 60,000 to 70,000 Indians are employed in Silicon Valley in the hi-tech sector and there is always a shortage. The influx had increased here around 1996-97 because of the Y2K opportunity,\" says Srivastava. He also came to the US for better job prospects in 1991 and worked with Tandem Computers (now Compaq) and Peerlogic before starting Balcom in 1996. </p> <p>And what has made Indians such a major force in the Valley? \"In the hi-tech field, quality and technical education in India and the US has made all the difference,\" says Srivastava. \"Technical capabilities and the ability to take risks have worked well for the community here. The 1990s will be seen as the decade of the rise of Indian entrepreneurship in the Valley. The growth of networking and internet technologies created unforseen technology niches which were quickly grabbed by Indian engineers to create many successful companies.\" </p> <p>Nitin Borwankar, who runs an internet and web-database consultancy in the San Francisco Bay area, insists that it is the atmosphere in the US and particularly in the Silicon Valley which makes a difference. If an entrepreneur fails he is always given the opportunity to try again. Having achieved much more than he could have dreamt of while leaving India almost two decades ago, Borwankar is also engaged in a joint software development venture with a Pune-based company. </p> <p>An alumnus of the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Mumbai, he worked for a short while in India before heading to the US to study at the University of Southern California. Borwankar feels it is the solid education in technical fundamentals like maths and physics and the ability to handle deep analytical problems that has given the community an edge in the field. \"Also, coming from a less industrialised country, we learn to do more with less,\" he adds. </p> <p>Interestingly, while the \"brain drain\" continues, the big players on the Indian IT scene seem unworried by it. Renee Jhala, head of corporate communications at Wipro Technologies, Bangalore, reveals that about one in eight staff seek to leave for opportunities abroad, mostly for higher education. Of the 6,000 IT professionals employed by the company, as many as 1,500 are posted outside India. </p> <p>\"But yes, we do have problems in getting people with specific skills like technical consultants and managers for high powered projects. They come for a price and, since we operate at a global level, we are willing to pay,\" she admits. </p> <p>Suresh Raisinghani, director of the systems integration division of Tata Infotech in Mumbai, concedes that whenever a big company employs IT personnel, it is always aware that 12-15% of the staff could migrate in a steady stream. </p> <p>And of those jumping jobs, about 60% leave the country. </p> <p>\"We have a workforce of 3,000 plus infotech people and can handle the staff crunch, but it has happened so many times that smaller companies have closed down because of this migration,\" he says. </p> <p>\"Eventually, even the owner packs his bag and leaves for a job in the US.\"</p>",
  "<p>The mood was remarkably upbeat at the UK Internet Summit, despite panel representations from LetsBuyit.com and Priceline.com, both of whom have been reported as experiencing difficulties recently.</p> <p>A year on from the first Summit, the difference was immediately apparent in the number of City suits and ties in evidence. Clearly this was a reflection of the changing focus of the internet industry into one that deals with the City on a daily basis, but observers couldn't help but notice the increasing absence of entrepreneurial activity in favour of talk about business applications and profit. Indeed, the overall feeling coming out of the event was that the internet is no longer exciting, but all about business processes, profit and IPOs. </p> <p>Admittedly, this is very much a by-product of a maturing industry but many believe there is far too much attention given to the business side of the industry, over and above the creative flow of ideas on which the industry was founded. </p> <p>Regardless of individual opinions, the UK Internet Summit never set out to focus on entrepreneurialism but organised seminars that asked questions such as, 'The www - a tool for business or something more?' and 'Is there anything new in business?', and pulled in high-profile panellists such as Martin Sorrell, Esther Dyson and Stelios Haji-Ioannou. </p> <p>The chancellor of the exchequer, Gordon Brown, took the opportunity to talk about UK Online and said the government was planning to provide 100,000 recycled computers to low income families, starting in Liverpool.</p> <p><strong>Snapshots:</strong> </p> <p><strong> Martin Sorrell, chief executive of WPP Group:</strong><br> \"Over the past six months we've seen the reverse of the traditional brands.
