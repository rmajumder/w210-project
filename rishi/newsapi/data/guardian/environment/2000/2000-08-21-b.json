  "<p>Although there is an almost universal expectation that Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan and his colleagues will leave US rates on hold this evening, market professionals were taking no chances yesterday. </p> <p>In a lacklustre session, values of the leading shares ended little changed as institutional investors headed for the sidelines, refusing to make any big plays until the announcement is made. </p> <p>Ever since the Fed started to tighten interest rates in the middle of 1999, the meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee have been crucial events for global equity markets. By the close of trade the FTSE 100 was 1.5 points weaker at 6,542.2 - off the day's low of 6,491.4 - as Wall Street started the week in positive territory. </p> <p>Just over 1bn shares were traded, with market heavyweight <strong> Vodafone</strong>, down 3.5p at 264.5p, accounting for 212m of that total. </p> <p> <strong> Boots</strong> was always among the best blue-chip performers yesterday, lifted by reports that US discount retailer Wal-Mart is considering a \u00a36bn takeover bid. </p> <p>While analysts thought a bid by Wal-Mart was unlikely, they said the story served as a reminder that, at current levels, Boots is not only cheap but vulnerable to a takeover. </p> <p>A year ago Boots shares were changing hands at 750p. Last night they closed at 516p after rising 16p. </p> <p> <strong> Sainsbury</strong>, which has been mentioned in various quarters as a buyer of Boots, ended the day unchanged at 325p. </p> <p>Securities house Merrill Lynch has upgraded its long-term recommendation on the stock to \"accumulate\" from \"neutral\". </p> <p>Analyst Sara Carter thinks it is wrong to write off the company. If it gets its act together - and there are signs that under the leadership of Prudential boss Sir Peter Davis this is happening - Carter reckons the shares could hit 390p. </p> <p> <strong> Allied Domecq</strong>, up 7.75p to 332.75p, bounced back from Friday's weakness, helped by whispers that the Swedish owners of Absolut vodka favour its bid for the drinks business, Seagram. </p> <p>Vin &amp; Sprit, which has granted the distribution rights for Absolut to Seagram, is said to be ready to oppose a sale to the Diageo-Pernod Ricard consortium. </p> <p>Biotech company <strong> Celltech</strong> was in demand, adding 36p to \u00a314.21, ahead of interim figures next month. According to Lehman Brothers analyst Ian Smith, the company may even report a small profit. </p> <p>On the down side, Anglo-Norwegian health group <strong> Nycomed Amersham</strong> fell sharply after CSFB's top-rated biotech team restarted coverage with a \"sell\" recommendation. CSFB reckons fair value for Nycomed shares is 437p, compared with yester day's closing price of 583p, down 19p. </p> <p>CSFB claims the market is wrongly valuing Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, in which Nycomed has a 55% stake, as a knowledge company for drug discovery rather than an equipment manufacturer. </p> <p>After Friday's near-20% rise on the back of Nortel Networks bid speculation, <strong> Bookham Technology</strong> came back down to earth with a bump. The shares ended 160p lower at \u00a330.80 as investors moved to lock in gains. </p> <p>Among the second-liners <strong> Fibernet</strong>, the long-distance telecoms specialist, gained 150p to \u00a317.00 as Deutsche Bank repeated its \"strong-buy\" rating and eye-catching \u00a327 target price. </p> <p>Deutsche believes the share price only reflects the fair value of Fibernet's British operation and completely ignores the potential of its expansion into Europe . </p> <p>In the small cap universe, aside from the usual demand for stocks tipped in the weekend press, eyebrows were raised by the late surge in wallcoverings and carpets group <strong> Walker Greenbank</strong>. Its shares ended 7.25p better at 39p, on turnover of 3.5m.</p>",
  "<p>Stands the clock at 10 to 3? And is that a supermodel in row B? Thanks to global warming, exotic creatures are increasingly to be seen far from their traditional habitats. Not only that, they appear quite comfortable at latitudes that were once assumed to be hostile to them. </p> <p>Adriana Sklenarikova, Christian Karembeu's supermodel wife, did not make it here on Saturday but Alen Boksic already looks right at home in the Premiership. He has had an undistinguished time of it recently - the season before last he did not actually play a complete game for Lazio or Croatia - but he is still only 30 and appears little debilitated. </p> <p>On his Middlesbrough debut he laid on the first goal, scored the other two and should have been allowed a third. He has strength and pace and application, supposedly the staples of the English game, as well as intelligence, technical ability and a relentless eye for counter-attacking opportunities. Maybe he should have been over here all along. </p> <p>And this is not even the complete Boksic. The striker had hardly begun training with Lazio, because the Serie A season does not start until October. What will he be able to do when he is match fit? \"I will be an excited manager,\" said Bryan Robson, \"if he gets better than that.\" </p> <p>Robson said that he had been \"trying to bring in real quality players\" and on the evidence of this match he has had some success. Joseph-Desire Job has less experience than Boksic but showed a maturing appreciation of an unusual role, attacking wide on the right, and took his goal splendidly, getting on the wrong side of Marcus Hall and deftly placing his header past Magnus Hedman. And Karembeu, who is Real quality, looked outstanding in the hostile confines of an English midfield, even if he appears to be duplicating Paul Ince's work. </p> <p>Though Coventry ran the middle half-hour of the game, they have some catching up to do. They have lost their player of the season and their two leading scorers. In addition, Mustapha Hadji, Stephen Froggatt and Tomas Gustafsson are out injured and others have suffered an interrupted pre-season. Gordon Strachan's legendary equanimity was further tested 20 minutes from the end when David Thompson was sent off for a tackle on Ince that won the ball. </p> <p>Cheap red cards are an occupational hazard these days, along with over friendly supermodels. Karembeu met his on an aeroplane. There is hardly a check-in counter queue that is not decorated by the odd supermodel and her half-ton of Gucci luggage. </p> <p>Highfield Road, though, is resisting. At the end of this game steely-eyed stewards ringed the pitch, just in case Cindy Crawford had come for Colin Hendry.</p>",
  "Labour should rebrand the DTI, making it not the Department of Trade and Industry but the Department for Technology and the Internet. That would send an instant, important message about its crucial role in the information revolution. For if the DTI had no other task than to bully companies and public sector bodies into reinventing their businesses to meet the needs of the internet age, then it would earn its budget 10 times over. <p>After all, Britain's future economic growth will depend on the speed with which we embrace the new technologies. </p> <p>The beauty of it is that it won't cost money. The DTI is already a low spender. Expenditure this year (which was only \u00a33.7bn) is set to grow by 23%, but that's because of spending on the detritus of the old economy - liabilities arising from the nuclear power and coal industries. The really important things the department can do for the new economy are not about spending money, but about structure and competition. The DTI is potentially more powerful than it ever was in its \"interventionist\" period under the last Labour administration because of its ability to set the parameters within which the new economy operates. </p> <p>Take the auction of segments of the radio spectrum for the \"third generation\" of mobile phones, which raised \u00a322.5bn. Irrespective of whether you think this is a fiscal coup or a recipe for unaffordable phones, it does show the enormous power the DTI still wields. </p> <p>The department also played a leading role in the European-wide adoption of GSM (global system for mobile communications) as the standard for the current generation of mobile phones. The move attracted virtually no publicity at the time - nothing is more boring than a story about standardisation - yet the creation of this common European system is the single biggest reason why Europe now leads the world in mobile phones. </p> <p><b> Television</b><br> </p> <p> Labour should propose two policies of comparable importance. First, pull the plug on analogue television as soon as possible. Eventually all televisions will be digital offering better definition, internet access, email, interactive sport, home shopping and, maybe the final marriage of the computer terminal and the television set. Remember, countries that switch over en masse to digital earliest, will have \"first mover\" advantage to develop products and services to sell to the world. </p> <p>The only serious argument against an early switch off - that poor people won't be able to afford the cost - is potent but can be solved by subsidising adoption of digital television for the poor out of the money that will be raised from auctioning off the analogue spectrum released by the switch to digital. </p> <p>Second, Labour should insist that British Telecom's monopoly of the \"local loop\", the last mile from the exchange to your home, is opened up immediately and affordably to competitors offering broadband access. The aim is to get broadband (that is, high speed links capable of two-way video transmission) to as many homes as possible in the shortest time. </p> <p>This argument has been going on for more than 15 years. The Conservatives refused BT's offer to bring broadband to homes in exchange for being allowed to broadcast entertainment (like profitable video on demand) because it would have undermined the government's encouragement of cable companies to set up in competition with BT. It didn't occur to ministers that if high-capacity fibre optics had been laid to every home as \"common carriers\", there would have been no need to dig up the roads for cable. </p> <p>BT has been resisting government sponsored incursions into its lucrative monopoly of the local loop so as to protect its revenues. The government should take BT on, in order to get broadband everywhere as soon as possible - so that consumers can enjoy it and companies can develop products on the back of it to sell on the world markets. </p> <p>Labour should do this in conjunction with an all-out effort by the DTI, as a kind of free management consultancy, to make sure that companies, especially smaller ones, hook their businesses on to the internet. The prime minister has already made a bold promise of Britain becoming the best place in the world for e-commerce but the government itself is not setting the lead. Whitehall websites, though improving, lack professionalism. And when it comes to a sensitive issue like the government's power to monitor email through the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act, the DTI has been only too happy to pass the buck to the Home Office. Britain will, therefore, have one of the most draconian regimes in the world. </p> <p><b> Ireland</b><br> </p> <p> The regulatory situation in the UK could lead companies to set up in Ireland where, deliberately, there is a regime that's friendly to industry, and where email communications between companies are more secure. This is yet another example of the enormous power government wields even when it isn't spending anything. Labour should promise, for business as well as civil libertarian reasons, to repeal the RIP act. </p> <p>This principle also applies to the DTI's ongoing role in the \"old economy\". The single most important thing it could and should do costs nothing, yet it has always been shirked. The DTI should be the unashamed public advocate of a competitive exchange rate for industry. That means campaigning for a rate up to 20% lower than it is now. If it had done this before, it could have avoided a worsening trade deficit, the intense profits squeeze on exporters, and the crises in the motor, textile, coal and steel industries. </p> <p>It is absurd that the DTI has acquiesced in a surcharge on the industry it is supposed to be sponsoring. It is time the DTI changed from being a department of industry to a department for industry. Labour should lead that switch. </p> <p>However, there are still several areas where extra money must be spent. Not in the form of old-style subsidies but as seed corn. As we discuss elsewhere in the manifesto, one is on an increase in the science budget - with the budget rising from \u00a31.6bn this year to \u00a32.2bn in 2003/4, and helped by windfalls from the Wellcome Trust, scientists are starting to feel wanted again, but their expectations have been dimmed by the neglect of the past two decades. The completion of the genome project has added a new urgency to the task of converting good ideas from the lab into world-class products in industry. And if Britain is to profit from the explosive growth expected in the biotech industries, then pump-priming money must be made available - maybe as incentives for venture capital companies - to convert Britain's expertise into the raw material for economic growth in the 21st century. </p> <p>The same goes for alternative energy resources such as wind and solar power, the forgotten parts of the DTI's portfolio. It is barmy, the department having to spend tens of millions on the liabilities created by the rapid decline of coal and nuclear power while not being able to spend greatly increased resources on environmentally clean alternative resources. </p> <p>It wouldn't cost much to bridge the gap between research on clean renewables, and the market place. It would be a long-term investment with an assured future return and with hardly any serious implications for inflation. It would barely make a pinprick on the \u00a322.5bn the DTI has already raised for the Treasury this year from the radio spectrum auction. It is difficult to think of money that would be better spent. </p> <p><b>Pledges</b></p> <p><b> 1.</b> Rebrand the DTI as the Department for Technology and the Internet </p> <p><b> 2.</b> Campaign for a lower exchange rate </p> <p><b> 3.</b> Pull the plug on analogue television now </p> <p><b> 4.</b> Make the DTI a free consultancy for smaller companies </p> <p><b> 5.</b> Spend money on solar and wind power - to turn scientific discoveries into successful companies</p>",
  "The education secretary signalled his growing concern yesterday at the widening gap between the performance of male and female pupils. He is right to be concerned. Last Thursday, the A-level results showed girls outperforming boys, achieving a higher proportion of A grades for the first time in the 49-year history of the exam. <p>This Thursday, the GCSE results are released. The last results showed girls widening the gap in the proportion gaining five good passes (grade C and above) to 10% for the first time - with 53% of girls reaching this benchmark compared with just 43% of boys. But for boys, the government would already have reached its 2002 target of 50% of pupils achieving five good passes. The story for pupils aged 11 is even grimmer, with 61% of girls achieving the expected reading standard, compared with just 46% of boys. </p> <p>Earlier this summer, the Conservatives called on the government to overhaul GCSE exams, after new figures showed that boys' results were getting worse in more than a fifth of English education authorities. Boys' results deteriorated in 33 areas last year, including even some affluent suburbs. Theresa May, the Tory education spokeswoman, blamed the introduction of course work, which is more suited to girls, with their readiness to work more systematically and conscientiously than boys. </p> <p>Sensibly, ministers are refusing to take precipitate action. Overall, boys' performance has been improving, but not by nearly as much as that of girls. There is no simple solution to this complex phenomenon. David Blunkett rightly noted yesterday that the problems facing boys were particularly acute, with the disappearance of the old traditional routes into manual and craft employment in the new knowledge-driven global economy. Under-achievement by any group - gender, race or class - must be tackled if equal opportunities are to be promoted. </p> <p>This is not the first generation of boys to have regarded serious study at school as \"uncool\". The spotty, bespectacled swot has always been a figure of derision. But earlier generations appear to have been more ready to study surreptitiously. Bob Geldof explained on Desert Island Discs how shocked he had been at school when his mates who claimed not to have been swotting for exams had clearly been secretly revising. The fact that the biggest current gap in performance is between working-class boys and girls makes the problem more acute for a Labour government intent on creating an inclusive society. Laddish culture crosses all class barriers, but appears to be having the worst effects on the most deprived. </p> <p>It is two years since local education authorities were asked to introduce programmes to tackle boys' under- achievement. They are now being asked to provide an evaluation of their programmes. Not all the news is bleak. The daily literacy and numeracy hours, introduced into primary schools in 1998, appear to be narrowing the gaps in some tests at 11. Pilot programmes involving single-sex classes in some subjects in mixed schools have produced some promising early results, but will need rigorous evaluation. The education secretary is keen to attract more male teachers to provide more role models for pupils. Only 17% of primary teachers are male, but the new \u00a36,000 training bursaries increased inquiries from male postgraduates by 50%. A wider, more relevant curriculum, with vocational courses linked to job opportunities, would help girls as well as boys - and reduce the number of pupils, currently 80,000, who leave at 16 with no qualifications.</p>",
  "<p>Greg Dyke does not watch Big Brother. There. It's been said. It had to come out sooner or later. \"I've been away for most of it. Haven't seen enough to make a judgment. What are the figures like?\" Granted he's been on holiday, but really, there's no excuse. Sitting in his glass-walled meeting room on day 33 of the country's latest TV phenomenon, the director-general of the BBC must be the only person in the media who doesn't have an opinion on whom to evict. </p> <p>Seven months into his term as DG, Dyke looks tanned, fit, healthy and chirpy. There is no visible deterioration of his general appearance with which to chart the traumas of the year thus far. John, now Lord, Birt didn't leave the BBC until February, but Dyke has just about been in Broadcasting House for a year now. Long enough, you can't help but fear, to have gone native. </p> <p>Certainly long enough for a holiday in Malaysia and Singapore with the family, from which he's returned to write his MacTaggart lecture to be delivered on Friday. It will be his second MacTaggart - a previously unoffered honour. The last, just six years ago, emphasised the need for broadcasters, particularly the BBC, to stand up to government. Judging by his mood, his opinions haven't changed on that front. </p> <p>He will not spoil his lecture today. As it will spell out his vision of the future of the BBC, Dyke's BBC, we can make a good guess at what it might contain. Media mystics, of which there are many, suggest we might hear news of EastEnders - there have been rumours for some time that the soap will increase its number of weekly episodes - and perhaps a decision about moving the 9pm news bulletin to 10pm which seems inevitable. </p> <p>But those are the teasers. The meat of Dyke's speech will deal with his plans for the BBC's television networks. Already spoiling for a fight are those who believe the future of BBC 1 is under threat from an apparent Dyke initiative to move all the clever programmes to BBC 2 - leaving BBC 1 in some kind of Noel's House Party hell and somehow rather woollily using the two digital channels, Choice and Knowledge (for these purposes renamed BBC 3 and 4) to mop up the rest of the output. Doubtless somewhere at the heart of this fancy is a kernel of a plan. Dyke's friends admit he likes to float an idea out and test the reaction before settling on something less drastic. </p> <p>Clearly the casual floating of ideas leads to outraged reactions, but Dyke says he is unconcerned by the outrage professed thus far. \"The reaction is based on a false premise so I'm not concerned at all.\" People have got the wrong idea, he says, because they always do. \"What always happens is something gets in there as an idea. It then gets into the cuttings as something real, then everyone thinks that it's happened. That was never the intent.\" </p> <p>Why float the ideas then? \"I don't float 'em publicly. They get public. Everything gets public out of here. But if you want to have an open, interesting environment, then the cost of it is that stuff gets out and gets picked up. That's a price worth paying. Because actually you want that environment. </p> <p>\"The idea that on BBC1 we're not going to have factual programmes or news and current affairs is just not true. But what is an interesting idea is . . .\" he stops. This is unlike Dyke, who in all his previous existences (at Pearson TV and further back at LWT and TV-am) has been admirably unable to resist a frank answer to a straight question. It hardly seems necessary to add that this has not been a popular style among senior BBC executives of recent years. (He's not very good at the BBC-style answer either. Later on, he stops in the middle of a story with, \"hang on, I'd better be careful what I say\" - it's hardly the seamless stuff of Alastair Campbell's dreams.) </p> <p>\"What you have to do, and this is what I keep banging on about and I shall be banging on about again in the MacTaggart, is you have to say 'look, if this government wants digital switch-over at some point this decade, that means at some stage every home is going to be a digital home. At that stage the BBC will have a number of channels in every home. Therefore you have to say between here and there, what is the emerging channel portfolio you need? </p> <p>\"The trouble is it's catch-22. What you'd really quite like is to have that [portfolio] now. The difficulty is you've got a large part of the population who will not be digital till they have to be, and they pay their licence fee and they deserve to have the best of the BBC and you can't deny them. It's a journey between now and there.\" </p> <p>He argues, reasonably, that change at the BBC always means criticism. \"Always. I've read it all. I've read a lot of it in the last few weeks.\" Most of Dyke's initiatives so far, though, have been lauded and applauded. The honeymoon period, stumbling only slightly on the twin obstacles of the Queen Mother's birthday pageant and the failed bid to retain the Premier League highlights, extended right up to the changes to BBC1. </p> <p>\"Yeah, but everything else is irrelevant. Right? Everything else is about finding money. In the end, what is television about? What is radio about? It's about a combination of money and talent. You're not going to get talent to work here if they don't like the place - if they think it's vicious or unpleasant or bureaucratic or all the rest of it, so you've got to change that. </p> <p>\"Secondly, you've got to find money. Which means to find 24% of the money in this place being spent running the place is just not acceptable, right? What matters is what goes out. What we listen to, what we use. The rest is just organisational stuff. </p> <p>\"So I mean it's easy, isn't it? I come in and say: 'I believe in programmes and I'm going to give you more money' and they're gonna love me, aren't they? They're going to love you for saying that. That's the easy stuff. The real question is, once you've got the money available, can we free up that talent and make this an exciting place to work for creative people? Cos if we can't, we're dead.\" </p> <p>It's a recurring theme of Dyke's fabled management technique that he believes the workplace should be fun. He's said it many times. Anyone who talks to BBC employees on a regular basis would find it hard to believe that the corridors are ringing with joy just now. </p> <p>Do you think this a fun place to work at the moment? \"For me?\" No. Not for you. For everyone else. If it's not fun for you, you can go. He is slightly riled. \" They can go. That's what I said on day one. 'If you don't like it here, go somewhere else'. People get trapped into places that they don't need to be trapped in. This is an industry that's booming. </p> <p>\"One person that left came to me and they described their last couple of years and they had been very unhappy. And I just said, 'Well why don't you leave?' And they said, 'Do you know I never thought about that.' If you're unhappy, my view of the world is that you change it. You. The world isn't going to change it for you. You change it. Do something else.\" </p> <p>But, you still have the responsibility to make the culture of your corporation happy. \"Sure you've got to make it happy. It's supposed to be fun.\" So, do you think they're having fun? Dyke sighs. \"It depends where you are. I mean . . . No. Being here in an organisation where a lot of people are being made redundant if they're around you is not nice. It's very unpleasant . . . I hate doing it. All I can say is we treat people very fairly and they happen to be lucky that they're moving out into a labour market at the moment in this industry which is booming.\" </p> <p>How many people have actually been sacked? \"Dunno.\" Again, this is not like Dyke. Roughly? \"Some people saw the writing on the wall and went away. We expect to shed 1,200 jobs. They won't all be fired. There are areas where we got rid of 40% of the staff and we're having to recruit people because we haven't got rid of them, they just left. </p> <p>\"I don't like doing it. I didn't come here to do it. But at the end of the day the obligation upon us must be to put as much of the money on to the screen as we can.\" </p> <p>Have you sacked anyone yourself? Pause. \"Yeah.\" Not in the past, here at the BBC? \"Yeah. Well not sacked, I don't say sacked. But yes.\" What do you say to them? \"Er, what I say them is what I say to everyone - it is not your fault. It is not their fault. The world changes and organisations change. There is not a lot you can do about it.\" </p> <p>But a place like the BBC develops a mind of its own. While there remain \"lifers\", those who have worked in the corporation for their entire career and are now running huge chunks of it, it seems inevitable that they will recreate their new streamlined departments in the image of those which were there before. Like a persistent verucca, the suits spring up and regrow just where they were before. </p> <p>It's impossible to prevent, Dyke declares, adding that the BBC will need a further restructure in around five years' time. \"All organisations do it. If you're not taking out overhead you're putting it on. There is no in-between.\" </p> <p>That's why he has introduced the target. The 24% of the BBC's income which is spent on bureaucracy is unacceptable. He wants to get it down to 15%. \"I can understand having worked here why the bureaucracy can become too big. I suspect it's the same in any public sector organisation. Because when you sit in a profit and loss company and you think of a way of saving \u00a31m, you put it on to your profit and that profit goes up by 15%, so it's probably worth about \u00a320m in value to your company. </p> <p>\"If you sit in the BBC where all you do is spend money, you spend \u00a32.2bn a year so \u00a31m is . . .\" (he snaps his fingers). His much-vaunted cost-cutting initiatives - banning croissants at BBC breakfast meetings and chauffeur-driven cars - are about changing the culture rather than the actual savings involved, he points out. \"If people want fresh flowers on their desks then they can pay for them. And we've put a ban on booking cars. You're not allowed to have more than 15 minutes' waiting time and we've put on a bus service between the bits of the BBC . . . Those things are about saying, 'look we don't waste money'.\" </p> <p>In his first months the paperwork situation has improved, he says, to aid his notoriously short attention span. \"Once people began to understand I wasn't going to read it they cut it short . . . I always carried all my paper around in boxes. Once I lost one. It didn't seem to make any difference. What I do is have about 10 ideas going. That's what I'm interested in.\" </p> <p>He's also anxious to eradicate what he calls the \"report mentality\" of the BBC, but what others - notably Private Eye - have termed Birtspeak. \"I think one of the dangers is there was almost a culture here of: 'having written the paper, that was the end of it'. I'm not interested in papers, I'm interested in what we do. Do you know what I mean?\" Oh yes. I vividly recall Extending Choice - the BBC's Role in the Digital Age. \"Yeah. My view is, Look, the paper's irrelevant. What are we going to do? What are we going to change?\" </p> <p>Of course, he won't say what he will change about the output, but he's not a fan of endlessly imitating formats. Describing the imitations of Changing Rooms and Driving School which inhabit much of the BBC and its rivals, he says television \"milks everything\" and \"eats material\". Asked if any BBC network is at the top of its game, he answers that the radio stations are doing well and talks about a new-found appreciation of Radio 2. BBC 1, he says, has got some good bits but needs more and BBC 2 \"is still, erm, not sure what it is\". Dyke says that, unlike Channel 4, BBC 2 never has had a strong sense of its identity. It's perhaps more fair to say that like Channel 4, BBC 2 has experienced peaks and troughs of self-knowledge - as Channel 5 found it when it launched, no matter how much you spend on branding or marketing, channels tend to define themselves around two or three hit shows. Dyke knows this. </p> <p>Dyke has been careful in all his talk of BBC revolution to be sensitive to the Birt years (\"John and I believed in very similar things, I just think we have a very different style of management\"). The logical inference that the shape of the BBC will hence be similar under Dyke to under Birt, is swiftly denied, however. \"No. Because I think . . . I think . . . If you want organisations to change you have to carry the staff with you. If you can't carry the staff with you, you can't change it.\" Dyke wrote a (largely ignored) report on the health service for the government a couple of years ago and it's there that he sees parallels with the BBC. </p> <p>\"The problem with the health service, and you saw it in the BBC, was that the people down on the coalface thought they did it despite the management and despite the organisation - not because of it. That was the biggest change you had to make. Somehow John had lost contact, the relationship with the people who worked here. You can't do that, because otherwise there's no purpose. I actually believe that organisations only work when there is a common belief in what you're trying to achieve. And that's most of what I spend my time doing.\" </p> <p>He confesses it's been difficult to adjust. Though he will admit to few low points, saying he is too much of an optimist to see life in that way, he is surprisingly animated when he brings up the row the Times created about his shareholdings. Recognising that he is a man of considerable personal wealth, the BBC governors gave him a number of months to dispose of various shares - notably in Granada Group - that he owned, before taking over as DG. He is still bruised by the coverage of what the Times perceived to be his dishonesty.</p> <p> \"It was deeply unfair. I was doing precisely what the BBC had asked me to do. I didn't even negotiate a contract. When I got the job I just signed what they wanted. The suggestion that somehow you were corrupt for taking the job when in all honesty no one, well certainly not me, would take it for the money. I've got enough money, I don't need the money.</p> <p> \"And suddenly you realise you're in a much, much more political world. That's it. You're closer to the world of politics than you are to the world of business and I don't like that a lot. I chose many years ago not to be a politician. They're the bits I don't like.

It was along the lines of, if you really want to change the BBC, stay away from Westminster. \"I think there's some truth in that. It's not the role of broadcasters to be in governments' pockets\".</p> <p> As a sceptic on the subject of external content regulation, he wouldn't change the board of governors, he protests, even if he could (he can't). His review of BBC Worldwide, the BBC's commercial arm, is next on the list. There he predicts more joint ventures with outside companies and will not rule out selling off chunks of the BBC, such as some of BBC Online, if the numbers add up.</p> <p> So he can change staff morale, the report culture, he can move money from structure to output and he can sell off bits of the BBC but he can't change the governors, the political interference or the criticism. And one more thing. It's quite warm in here, I observe. \"Don't get me going.\" he responds. \"The Chinese minister for culture came here and he said, 'Mr Dyke, it is very warm in here, could you turn down the heating?' I said: 'Minister there are some things I can do about the BBC and some I can't. One thing I can't do is change the air conditioning.'\" He laughs and laughs.

  "<p>Fifty tonnes of depleted uranium is lying unmonitored in scrap heaps across Britain, posing a growing risk of environmental contamination and to workers, according to US government documents. </p> <p>The uranium was used as components in aircraft and hospital radiotherapy units and increasingly is left unregulated as the equipment is decommissioned. </p> <p>A US company has told British and American authorities that the uranium components have been accumulating in Britain \"in a multitude of dispersed locations, where they pose a growing risk of loss of control, personnel exposure and contamination of the environment\". </p> <p>The information was released under the US freedom of information laws but has been declared confidential by the environment agency and by the Department of Trade and Industry in Britain. </p> <p>The US firm, Philotechnics Ltd, has applied to salvage the uranium and recycle it where possible. It would not specify the use to which the recycled material would be put, but the Guardian has learnt that the company intends to pass it to another firm, which has produced equipment for the US department of defence. The unusable uranium would be buried at a licensed site in Texas. </p> <p>The most well-known military use of recycled depleted uranium is in tank-piercing ammunition. </p> <p>This is the first proposed shipment of the material out of Britain. There is no recycling or disposal route available in the UK, and airlines and hospitals are said to be increasingly concerned as the extent of the scrap emerges. Philotechnics said the scrap would mainly come from older British aircraft that use depleted uranium as counterweights to aid flight. </p> <p>The company said that while the aircraft were in service the depleted uranium in use was primed, plated and painted to prevent corrosion, but Donald Barbour, Philotechnics' aviation programmes manager, warned that after decommissioning it was \"highly probable\" the counterweights would release uranium oxides. These are toxic, and residual radioactivity causes cancer. </p> <p>British Airways said it had 11 Boeing 747s in service carrying these counterweights, but a spokesman said it had sold on all its decommissioned aircraft that carried them. </p> <p>Miles Warren, director of Active Collection Bureau, in Sittingbourne, Kent - where the first 20-tonne shipment will be gathered within weeks if the application is approved - said there would be many sources of scrapped uranium components. </p> <p>\"A typical scenario would be where a company has gone bust and the auctioneers clear it out and find an old source container on a pallet and shove it to the back of their garage,\" he said. \"Some hospitals didn't known they had depleted uranium in their radiotherapy heads. The equipment is often made so long ago that a lot of it has long been obsolete.\" </p> <p>Under Philotechnics' proposals the usable material would be transferred to the recycling specialists Manufacturing Sciences Corporation \"for inclusion in its production inventory\". </p> <p>Since 1985 MSC, bought by British Nuclear Fuels in 1997, has recycled 2,700 tonnes of depleted uranium into more than 70,000 products, including aircraft and machinery counterweights, flywheels, radiation shielding for x-ray machines and spent fuel casks.</p>",
  "<p>A government appointed regulator which polices the probity of \u00a3280m in tax credits given to thousands of UK environmental bodies paid its directors over \u00a3100,000 in fees for two years without authorisation, documents passed to the Guardian reveal. </p> <p>Entrust, the only private regulator, was set up by the Conservatives in 1995 to oversee financial probity of landfill tax credits, donated by the waste industry for environmental projects. The regulator has since barred five environmental bodies from the scheme, and two are under investigation by the serious fraud office over an alleged \u00a35.1m fraud. </p> <p>The Guardian is to pass details of the unauthorised fees to the Commons environment committee, which is to reopen its inquiry into the landfill scandal, after the paper's investigations and a Channel 4 Dispatches programme on illegal dumping and alleged misuse of the landfill tax credit scheme. </p> <p>Entrust's original memorandum of association did not allow salary or fees to be paid to its chairman or directors. Yet for the first two years the accounts show that Lord Cranbrook, the chairman, took fees of \u00a317,863 and \u00a320,200. Other directors took \u00a365,000 between them for the first year and \u00a319,807 for the second. </p> <p>In May 1998 the regulator held an extraordinary board meeting and the ruling was reversed to give retrospective authorisation to cover payments. </p> <p>Richard Sills, chief executive of Entrust, confirmed that the payments would have been considered ultra vires under government law but \"they were procedurally correct by measures taken in full conformance with company law\". </p> <p>He said: \"In the first difficult year of operation, the chairman and directors deferred all fees/salary due to them, so any incompatibility did not come to light. As soon as the anomaly was appreciated, legal advice was sought and appropriate remedies applied under company law, so that directors could be fairly rewarded for their services.\" </p> <p>The environment committee's reopened inquiry will be part of a wider investigation of the government's new waste initiative. The inquiry will look at the planned increase in incineration, waste recycling and better management of the disposal of hazardous waste. MPs have asked for written evidence by September 18. </p> <p>At the same time Sir John Bourn, comptroller and auditor general, will report to the Commons public accounts committee on whether action should be taken to tighten the landfill tax credit scheme. This committee has the power to summon customs and excise, which oversees Entrust, to appear before it. </p> <p>Copies of a 10,000-word report on the situation are being sent by the Guardian to Michael Meacher, environment minister, Richard Broadbent, chairman of customs and excise, Sir John Bourn and Andrew Foster, controller of the audit commission.</p>",

  "Almost every vehicle in Weipa is a four-wheel drive. Eagles circle above the local supermarket and many of its prefabricated houses are lightly dusted with paprika-red soil from a nearby bauxite mine. <p>The towns 2,500 residents live about as far off the beaten track as you can get, a 10-hour drive along dirt roads - washed out between November and April by monsoons - from the nearest city, Cairns. </p> <p>This small part of northern Australia's Cape York peninsula is not the easiest spot on which to assemble stage, sound and lighting facilities that wouldn't be out of place at Glastonbury and bring together 26 schools, 800 children and an audience larger than the town. </p> <p>But last week they all rolled up, in 4WD buses and chartered light aircraft, to join the Croc Eisteddfod festival, part of a growing drive to halt the destructive spiral of truancy, ill-health and addiction in many Aboriginal communities.</p> <p> For the third year running, the schools spent months planning 10-minute performances, where they danced to medlies of traditional didgeridoo-inspired music and the - more popular - pre-teen tunes of global favourites S Club 7, 5ive! and the Backstreet Boys. </p> <p> A local school from the Aboriginal village of Mapoon - a mere one-hour away - opened the Croc festival. Reluctantly interviewed by the compere, one pupil, Alan, said the festival's message was \"fun\".</p> <p> He was halfway there, for as subsequent participants and the organisers constantly stressed, it was about showing you could have a good time while remaining \"100% in control\", without recourse to three of the most destructive forces in isolated Aboriginal societies: alcohol, tobacco and other drugs. </p> <p> In Cape York's indigenous communities, 67% of adults smoke tobacco, compared to 25% of adult Australians. More than half Cape York's Aborigines drink at harmful levels, while 89% of the person-to-person injuries (the biggest cause of injuries) recorded in the area involve alcohol. </p> <p> These addictions help depress the life-expectancy of Aboriginal children to 27 years less than their white classmates. The Aborigine median age of death is 50; for the overall population of Australia it is 77. </p> <p> As Australia's movement to \"reconcile\" black and white Australia has shown, many are blamed for such inequality. Before European settlers spread into Cape York just over 100 years ago, its population was estimated at 20,000-50,000. It is now 6,000. </p> <p> Governments, religious missions and mining companies all helped herd Aborigines into camps, forcing the abandonment of their (healthy) hunting and gathering lifestyle. </p> <p> In 1967, Aborigines belatedly gained full Australian citizenship; they also \"won\" the right to drink. Collusion between breweries and state governments in the 1970s promoted the sale of alcohol in communities as one of the best money-making schemes for Aboriginal stores. </p> <p>Stuck in remote villages without jobs, a cycle of truancy, ill-health and addiction set in for many, cementing their dependence on state benefits. \"Welfare has been disastrous rather than helpful,\" says Kerry Arabena, former executive director of Cape York health council.</p> <p> It is a view increasingly echoed by influential Aboriginal leaders and by the communities themselves. </p> <p> \"Most of us, unfortunately, are dependent on benefits,\" says Peter Guivarra, chair of Mapoon's local council. He wants to be given resources to develop self-sufficiency through local trades, such as plumbing and carpentry, as well as expressing the more distant hope that eco-tourism could bring money and jobs into the area.</p> <p> \"We're living right on the water here. There is heaps of potential. The only way forward is economic development,\" he says. </p> <p> Such talk of economic development to end dependency pleases Australia's conservative government, which last week pledged to pass new welfare laws after the publication of a report calling for a benefits revolution along Blairite lines of \"mutual obligation\" - in short, that benefits should be worked for.</p> <p> But Aborigines already work for their benefits through community development economic programmes, which have been criticised by many Aboriginal leaders. Increasingly, \"partnership\" events, such as the Croc festival, are the great hope for providing Aboriginal communities with choices and opportunities. </p> <p> The Croc festival brings together the Queensland state government, local governments and the myriad support groups that make up what is disparagingly labelled the \"Aboriginal industry\".</p> <p> But working together in such informal and practical ways, say the groups, is a better tool of reconciliation than grand gestures, formal laws or government handouts. </p> <p> Such partnerships also stress the importance of real practical outcomes. The festival is already producing these.</p> <p> Shane Williams, director of Aboriginal student services in Queensland, says: \"Talking to schools we have seen level of attendance increase not just during the festival but throughout the year.\" </p> <p> Planning the performances helped stop truancy beforehand; afterwards the pupils basked in a proud glow from their 10 minutes strutting across the stage. </p> <p> \"What makes Mapoon good?\" the compere asked another local pupil, Brett. \"Not too many crocs,\" he replied. He couldn't get enough of the festival, but was less enthusiastic about the dangerous reptiles that lurk in Cape York's creeks. </p>",
  "<p>Politics and economics; national sovereignty, the control of monetary policy or the impact of currency instability; these are the staples of the debate over the single currency. But global warming, mad cow disease and swine fever? Just where do they fit in? </p> <p>In Denmark actually, where in just over a month's time voters go to the polls to decide whether their country should be the 13th to sign up for the euro. The issue is balanced on a knife edge. The latest opinion poll, out yesterday, puts the \"yes\" camp one point ahead of the \"no\" side - 44% to 43% - with the rest undecided. </p> <p>The \"no\" camp is coming up with some imaginative arguments in an attempt to tip the balance of opinion its way. The central theme is that, though the Danish krone is pegged to the euro in a narrow band, it still needs to retain the option to devalue. Why? Well, here is Keld Albrechtsen, the Unity List party's spokesman on European Union affairs. Global warming could spell trouble for low lying Denmark, he argues. </p> <p>\"Water levels in the oceans could rise so much that Denmark will no longer be an ideal place to live. If Copenhagen airport disappears under the sea, Denmark will face great economic problems.\" </p> <p>If you think devaluation at that stage might fall into the \"too little, too late\", not to say frankly irrelevant, category, Ole Krarup of the People's Movement against the EU has an alternative approach. Around 15% of Danish exports are agricultural produce and, according to Mr Krarup, an outbreak of mad cow disease or swine fever could do so much damage that devaluation would be the only solution to avoid a severe economic shock. </p> <p>If pigs and cows are not enough, rebel MP Frank Dahlgaard has an addition to the menagerie. Being tied to the euro, he says, is like being handcuffed to a gorilla. \"The gorilla sets the pace but we still have the key to unlock the handcuffs.\" So that's a \"no\" then.</p>"
