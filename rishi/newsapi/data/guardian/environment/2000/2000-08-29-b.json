[
  "<p>Probably the most quoted phrase at the Edinburgh film festival last week was Film Council chief executive John Woodward's declaration that the council would not be making \"social realist art films\". </p> <p>This is fighting talk, all the more contentious given that \"social realist art films\" were the defining flavour of the festival - not only British ones such as Paul Pawlikowski's Last Resort, but Crane World, about Argentinian construction workers, assorted Iranian entries, and the Sundance boxing hit Girlfight. Social realism is alive and passably well; even this year's Cannes winner, Lars Von Trier's ludicrous Dancer in the Dark, was social realism of a sort, spinning dance routines out of factory machine rhythms. </p> <p>The term \"social realism\" is itself misleading, still carrying echoes of the days when it was a prescriptive label in the Soviet Union, used to describe films and novels about idealistic agronomists and steel smelters. Social realism today really means films that address daily life in a serious fashion; it is a pressing issue in Britain because, in our current leisure-obsessed culture, the working grind has effectively become a taboo. Stephen Daldry's 80s-set Billy Elliott is representative of the way that British film addresses political realities only if they are safely tucked away in the past. The film, a calculated heart-warmer about a boy who wants to be a ballet dancer, may be set in County Durham during the miners' strike, but that is little more than period trimming. </p> <p>British cinema is generally averse to tackling the realities of working life, no doubt because of the commercial assumption that no one in their right mind would want to leave work on a Friday night and see a film set in an office or on the shop floor. Yet several recent French films have taken the working environment as material for drama that is engaging and entertaining, and not always as straightforwardly realist as you might expect. Take next week's release Whatever (Extension du Domaine de la Lutte), which wittily and nastily depicts office life as a pathological nightmare. </p> <p>Another French film released soon is Laurent Cantet's Ressources Humaines (Human Resources). It spins riveting, moving drama out of the most unpromising premise imaginable: the implementation of the 35-hour working week. Cantet's film is a story about the young son of a factory worker, an idealistic young business studies graduate who joins the personnel department of the factory where his father has worked all his life. The plot thickens when the managers use his idealistic suggestions to engineer redundancies. </p> <p>Cantet appears to be dealing with stereotypes: manipulative executives, devious paternalist boss, obstreperous shop steward. What's remarkable is that, with the exception of lead Jalil Lespert, all the film's players really are what they seem. Cantet recruited unemployed workers to play the factory staff; the boss was a real-life boss, and the shop steward a real shop steward. (This is not just a French art-film device: China's Zhang Yimou did much the same in his recent Not One Less.) The factory is a real factory, and it is amazing that Cantet was ever allowed to shoot such a militant project there; in fact, a new boss arrived at the factory shortly after the film was completed and barred Cantet from returning to photograph it for the film's poster. </p> <p>Cantet's trump card is that he not only analyses industrial conflict but analyses it through people and their relation to language. At weekends, they speak the language of bars and the dinner table; but come Monday morning, they fall easily into union rhetoric and the convoluted argot of the French business world. It is a matter not just of wearing suits or overalls, but of wearing your language like a uniform that makes you think and move like a different person. </p> <p>This is shopfloor drama with a touch of Roland Barthes. It is hard to describe Human Resources without making it seem like an arid social-studies tract. Yet Cantet's passionate film makes you re-examine all your preconceptions about what makes film drama involving. The industrial practice of \"annualisation\" may not seem the most promising screen material, but our own cinematic standbys of cheeky gangsters, clubland geezers and lovable young lads look pretty dreary in comparison.</p> <p>Human Resources opens at the National Film Theatre, London SE1 (020-7928 3232), on September 15.</p>",
  "For the householders on Yarningale common - 40 acres of meadow, forest and scrub - life was sweet, an idyll of spectacular vistas, lazy walks and rural quiet. <p>That was until their parish council asked them each to pay up to \u00a360,000 for the right to drive up to their homes. </p> <p>Claverdon parish council in Warwickshire is demanding fees for permission to drive across the parish common up to the front doors of 17 homes, some of which are worth hundreds of thousands of pounds; already one prospective sale is said to have fallen through as a consequence. </p> <p>The parish said it wanted to \"regularise\" vehicular access, but declined to discuss the issue further; if all 17 were to pay up, Claverdon would receive \u00a3500,000, making it possibly the wealthiest parish in the country. </p> <p>Corinne Mitchell, who lives close to the common, is leading opposition to the charges, even though she is not one of those who would have to pay. </p> <p>\"What is so annoying is that everything has been done in secret,\" she said yesterday. \"If we ask questions of the parish council about the common, they refuse to answer them. </p> <p>\"My husband's family have lived in the area for 200 years, and we feel it is morally wrong and unreasonable to have our commoners' rights extinguished by the council.\" </p> <p>Yarningale common was given to the village in 1950 by Leftbridge Galton, the lord of the manor, but it was effectively taken over and managed by the council. </p> <p>Mrs Mitchell said many villagers were angry because a small section of the community was being asked to fork out vast sums to access the common. </p> <p>\"It seems so unjust and the council is being very greedy and uncooperative,\" she said. \"People are pretty mad about it.\" </p> <p>She commented that the legislation the council was using was designed to prevent people driving over common land, not to stop them getting to their homes. </p> <p>Jim Storey lives at Oak Cottage, a property that is more than 400 years old. \"I am quite sure that a horse and cart would have been allowed to come across the land without too much trouble,\" he said. \"This has suddenly been dropped on us by the council.\" </p> <p>He said another homeowner had been told that they would have to pay many thousands of pounds to access their property - which cuts across a tiny strip of the common. </p> <p>Another resident said: \"It is ridiculous that people living here who rely on access will have to pay for that privilege. When these houses were built there was no mention of having to pay to go across the common.\" </p> <p>Louise Smith and her husband, David, claimed that they had had a \u00a3500,000 offer on their property, Oaktree farm, withdrawn after a prospective buyer learned that a \u00a360,000 right of access payment was required. </p> <p>The couple had received a letter telling them that they, or the new owners, needed permission to drive up a 50 yard track that leads from the lane to their house. </p> <p>\"The issue has never been raised before and, after nine years in the house, we are stunned,\" she said. \"It would be bad enough if the demand came from a private landlord, but this is our own parish council. </p> <p>\"The council chairman, David Clark, won't discuss the policy and sends back my letters marked 'return to sender'. The solicitors just quote the law at me.\" No one at the parish council's solicitors, Edward and Harris and Son in Swansea, was available for comment yesterday. </p> <p>John Maples, Conservative MP for Stratford-on-Avon, said: \"It is inappropriate for any landowner to exercise his rights in this way, let alone a council which exists for the good of the people. I do see the council's position. It is being advised that it must extract best value from its assets. But the government has made it clear that this does not mean it has to squeeze the last cent. [The parish council's] refusal even to discuss the situation seems unreasonable. I do think it is being very greedy.\" </p> <p>Mr Maples is due to meet representatives of the council next month to try to resolve the problem. </p> <p>A spokesman for the Department of the Environment said yesterday: \"Ministers have expressed sympathy. However, charging for this permission is quite legal. We are looking carefully at the complex legal issues, and will return to the subject when the countryside and rights of way bill is debated in the Lords in September.\"</p>",
  "Visitors to a stately home this weekend will pay \u00a34 to see fine furniture, learn a little history and watch a falconry demonstration. <p>But visitor income alone will not save Leighton Hall, Lancashire, built in 1763, listed Grade II* and long connected with the Gillow family, the renowned Lancaster furniture makers. </p> <p>Nor will the handsome cheque handed over for permission to shoot scenes for a film version of AS Byatt's novel Possession. </p> <p>And nor will fees from wedding receptions. \"There are not enough Saturdays in the year,\" said Richard Gillow Reynolds, who inherited the estate in 1977. </p> <p>He has since sought ways to boost the maintenance fund and had pinned his hopes on a time-share development based on farm buildings. But ministers turned down the scheme after a public inquiry. </p> <p>A crisis loomed. This year Mr Reynolds announced he would take no more bookings for weddings or corporate events. His wife, Suzie, warned that after showing round visitors for 25 years she could soon be giving estate agents the full tour. </p> <p>Mr Reynolds admitted that selling up would relieve him of a lot of worry and leave him comfortably off. \"But when you live in a house and on land for long enough it gets a grip on you. I have a responsibility to maintain, improve and hand on the estate to my daughter. I'm also concerned for the jobs of 60 people.\" </p> <p>He has had to deal with an annual cash shortfall which now runs at \u00a325,000. He had thought the time-share plan, with 55 upmarket units, was a winner. English Heritage approved, and Lancaster council gave planning permission. But villagers in Yealand Conyers objected, claiming that lanes would be clogged with traffic and the new buildings would be an eyesore. </p> <p>After the public inquiry, the Department of the Environment inspector ruled against the estate. It seemed inevitable that the \"for sale\" boards would go up. But now there is a glimmer of hope: a scheme for offices. </p> <p>\"The house will not now go on the market next year, and we have started taking bookings once more,\" said Mr Reynolds. \"But we will have to go through the planning process again.\"</p>",
  "<p>So, you think that you get along well with your boss? Maybe they compliment you on a job well done, send you a birthday card or invite you to spend the weekend at their country retreat. But how much do they like you really? Think ahead, as far as 30 years. When your boss dies, will he like you enough to remember you in his will? </p> <p>It sounds highly unlikely in today's frantically insecure workplace, yet earlier this month, that is what happened to 15 long-serving employees of the late Tory MP Michael Colvin. When he and his wife died in a fire at their home, recipients of their bequests included the gardener Bernard Taylor, who received \u00a36,700, and the laundry lady, the farm manager, the butler and the butler's wife, all of whom received \u00a31,000. </p> <p>While most employers might not go quite this far, there is evidence that an increasing number of firms are keen to foster a similarly paternalistic culture of loyalty. One recent example of this came from management consultants Arthur Andersen who announced that they are to hand out \u00a310,000 \"golden hellos\" to welcome all new graduate trainees, claiming that rather than wanting to trap them into a job for life, they were doing it because they wanted to help the recruits pay off their student debts. </p> <p>Elsewhere, particularly in the City, where the dot.com brain drain is hitting staffing levels, companies are trying to hang on to people by introducing supermarket-style reward points. These are accumulated and cashed in for benefits covering everything from paid sabbaticals to in-house yoga sessions. Nowhere is this loyalty culture more evident than at the west end offices of TBWA, the advertising agency, whose clients include the Labour Party. Staff can chill out in a leisure zone equipped with two Sony Playstation pods and all the latest games, video screens and a pool table. At six o'clock every evening the reception area is transformed into a subsidised bar and twice a week there's a happy hour where all drinks are free. </p> <p>The company is one of many who now offer two \"duvet days\" a year, where workers get permission to skive off, presumably very popular on mornings after happy hour. \"People work long hours here, and we want to reward them for that,\" explains Neil Christie, chief operating officer. \"One way is by letting them have a drink at the end of the day, it's kind of like everyone meeting up in the village square. Very often staff will then go back to their desks and work several hours in the evening, so it's like a tea break with booze. We like to make our staff feel part of something, to try and give something back.\" </p> <p>Increasingly, companies are falling over themselves to remind stressed-out workers that, yes, they may be working 12-hour days, but don't think for a minute that the boss doesn't care. \"The traditional concept of the loyal, wise boss who handed down universal benefits from on high is dead,\" says Nick Page, adviser on pay and conditions for the Chartered Institute of Personnel Development. \"That all disappeared during the high white-collar unemployment of the early 1980s; employees became disillusioned and more demanding. </p> <p>\"Now bosses are having to wake up to the fact that their staff are both individuals, and customers. In practice, that means companies are having to address the diversity of lifestyles among their workforce - in a creative business with a young staff, for example, it's not appropriate only to offer childcare and pension plans. By contrast, pet insurance is very popular in those types of firms - and 3% of firms we surveyed now offer that. Another way companies are trying to create loyalty is by giving something back, especially when staff work very long hours. That's why we're seeing 'concierge' benefits - grocery shopping, laundry and even on-site evening classes - becoming very popular.\" </p> <p>In the quest to nurture stressed-out employees, firms are resorting to increasingly desperate measures. Law firm Mischon de Reya experimented with a company poet. Management consultants Ernst and Young offer a confidential counselling line for staff to sort out their personal lives. Credit Suisse First Boston now offers honeymoon leave, and elsewhere in the City, Saloman Smith Barney has taken to providing gourmet meals, fresh underwear and free toothbrushes to staff working past 7pm. </p> <p>\"If you want to keep staff then you have to look after them,\" says Hilda Barrett, group human resources manager at Microsoft. \"That's why we try and create a campus atmosphere at our office. We have top quality gourmet food always available and in the evenings we even run cookery classes. Oh yes, and you also get Waitrose Direct, a grocery shopping service. Who wants to waste their spare time pushing a supermarket trolley?\" Every morning Microsoft workers are offered free fruit with breakfast, a nice touch, but one which might feel annoyingly prescriptive. At their headquarters there is an area called \"the anarchy zone\" where stressed out workers can play pool, watch a 54-inch cable TV screen, lounge around on squashy sofas, play video games, drink top quality lattes or read all the latest magazines. Despite the fact that writer Douglas Coupland branded the firm's workers Microserfs in a recent book, the staff turnover in the UK is only 8%. \"We must be doing something right,\" says Barrett. </p> <p>It's not surprising that the most far-reaching loyalty programmes are being introduced by American firms, where staff benefits are far more sophisticated. Ford provides its assembly line workers with free home computers, while it's rumoured that New York restaurants are resorting to pension plans in a bid to recruit dish washers. Recently, Seattle software company Aventail was so desperate to hire one 19-year-old graduate that it relocated two of her friends from Ohio and found them jobs too. </p> <p>As we all spend more and more of our lives at work, many employers are attempting to redress the balance by making office life more like home, often with the boss cast as surrogate parent. Business development agency The Fourth Room, for example, has offices which are designed like a house. Each morning the kitchen table is set for breakfast and a family lunch is held twice a week. British Airways' new head office near Heathrow takes the concept a stage further, featuring a Big Brother style corporate village with its own high street and TV station BA TV. More worrying still, staff are no longer known as employees but as residents. </p> <p>\"I don't think company loyalty is dead,\" says Lin Arigho, who runs design consultancy Aricot Vert. She was voted Britain's best boss in a recent competition of worker-friendly employers. \"I give people time off to go and do things that will help them to develop. One chap went off backpacking for eight weeks, another had time off for the Chelsea Flower Show. If they phone in and say they can't come in one day, they don't have to tell me the reason. I trust them. But I get it back from them in the end, because it's a case of me saving it up for later. If I need something finishing in a hurry, I know I can turn round to a person I've been very flexible with, and say, 'Now you can do this for me.'\" </p> <p>So maybe not everything about these new forward-thinking offices is perfect. \"You've got to question some of their motives,\" says Nick Page of the CIPD. \"If they're doing your shopping and laundry and dry-cleaning, and offering free drinks in the evening, the end result of all that is that you may end up working longer and longer hours with no overtime.\" </p> <p><strong> How loyal are you?</strong></p> <p><strong>Trisha King, media researcher</strong> </p> <p>I'm only here until I can get a break in the field I want. I know that and the company knows that - it even gives me time off for interviews. It's a small firm and we all get along brilliantly; there is constant banter in the office and we have regular staff nights out. I'll miss them but not enough to stick around. </p> <p><strong> Ben Andersen, urban regenerator</strong> </p> <p>I'm new to the company so my loyalty is at its all time high. At the moment it's inconceivable to see myself being tempted away. To keep up this level of loyalty the company would have to be more diverse than it is now. I can see myself moving in a couple of years' time because I want to change the field I'm in. If the company itself took that direction I would probably stay. </p> <p><strong> Elizabeth Coates, financial journalist</strong> </p> <p>I'll be loyal to this publication as long as it continues to provide me with opportunities - I don't want to get stuck in a rut. The magazine has a really good working environment, as well as an impressive reputation. I travel abroad frequently and the money's good. I wouldn't change jobs for a pay rise alone - it would have to be something which interested me. </p> <p><strong> Catherine Conway, bartender</strong> </p> <p>I'm totally loyal to the pub I work in because I'm treated well. They pay me decent money, give me lunch when I work and days off when I want, so I work hard. I used to work in a London pub owned by a big brewery. I got \u00a32.50 an hour and was treated like dirt. I couldn't have given a monkey's about them. This is a little company - we're treated well and work hard in return.</p>",
  "<p>British American Tobacco yesterday went on the offensive against the World Health Organisation, describing plans for a global framework to limit smoking as \"fundamentally flawed\" and simplistic. </p> <p>The company, which makes Rothmans, Benson &amp; Hedges and Lucky Strike cigarettes, called instead for \"a climate of genuine cooperation\", demanding that the world's big tobacco companies be involved in any attempts to regulate the industry. </p> <p>Chief executive Martin Broughton said: \"Our framework will relieve the WHO of the cost and bureaucracy in volved in its wish to become a single global tobacco regulator, leaving it free to do what it should be doing - policy orientation.\" </p> <p>BAT offered to support independent research on the reasons teenagers take up smoking. It proposed an \"agenda for action on health\", concentrating on measures to inform the public of the risks of tobacco, encourage people to switch to low tar products and prevent children from picking up the habit. </p> <p>BAT admits that there are \"serious health risks\" associated with its products. However, it stressed the importance of ensuring that tobacco markets remain orderly and that regulations on smoking in public places took into account the wishes of both smokers and non-smokers. </p> <p>Mr Broughton said: \"The WHO's proposal for a prescriptive 'one-size-fits-all' convention and protocols overlooks the diverse social, economic, cultural and political priorities in different countries around the world.\" </p> <p>The WHO, under the leadership of the former Norwegian prime minister Gro Harlem Brundtland, has made campaigning against smoking one of its top priorities. </p> <p>It says cigarettes could kill a billion people this century, at a rate of 10m a year by 2030, a forecast which BAT rejects.</p>",
  "<p><strong>JUMPED UP</strong></p> <p>Liverpool players of the mid-to-late Nineties were renowned for the sense of discipline instilled in them by Roy Evans - wasn't it unjust how they ended up without any trophies to show for their efforts while those gadabouts down the East Lancs Road spawned their way to a load of medals? So it comes as something of a shock that two alumni of that spicy scouse side are facing police charges after a night of Loaded-style high jinx.</p> <p>Phil Babb and Mark Kennedy were arrested this morning in Dublin after allegedly jumping around like a pair of ill-educated spoilt oafs on a parked car. Amusingly, they were reportedly collared in the city centre's Harcourt Square by the owner of said vehicle, a female police officer (who is presumably not on x thousand pounds per week and is aware of the value of money). The two eejits, who are in Ireland to \"prepare\" for the Republic's World Cup qualifier against Holland on Saturday, quickly found themselves up before the beak, who accused them of causing criminal damage, causing a breach of the peace and being drunk and disorderly.</p> <p>They were then freed on bail - after payment on their own sureties of IR\u00a3950 each, procedure fans - which meant they could be about their business. Sadly, this business will not now include playing World Cup football, because despite apologising profusely in a press conference, they've been expelled from the Irish squad by manager Mick McCarthy. Do you think Big Mick might have lost his temper with them?</p> <p><strong>PRAISE BE!</strong></p> <p>This morning, Leeds chairman Peter Ridsdale was a very happy man. A very happy man indeed. Because not only were his team - inspired by Pastor O'Leary O'Leeds's heavenly 4-3-3 formation and the born-again Alan Smith - still unbeaten, but he had also managed, at long last, to persuade Norwegian teen firebrand John Arne Riise to say no to sunny Monaco, no to beaches and buxom blonde babes, and yes, yes, yes to the earthy pleasures of West Yorkshire!</p> <p>Of course, the Fiver doesn't know exactly how Ridsdale did it - does anyone? - but last night a smitten Riise was cooing: \"It would take something special for me to leave Monaco but Leeds are such a club.\" However, barely had the young buck packed his dog-eared copy of Wuthering Heights when a hard-nosed Monaco official called the deal off. Again. So it was left to a clearly disappointed Risdale to break the news: \"John Arne Riise is not coming to Leeds,\" he admitted. \"I spoke to the club yesterday and they reiterated he is not for sale at any price.\" </p> <p>But before the whole of Elland Road could sink into a full-scale clinical depression, up popped a joyous Pastor, with a tambourine in one hand and a song-sheet for Kum-By-Ya in the other, to announce that the born-again Smith had been called up into the England squad for Saturday's friendly against France. \"England have suffered a number of injuries to the forward department, so [Kelvin Koogan] has called him up to the squad,\" O'Leeds announced. \"I'm absolutely delighted for him and I know he won't let [Koogan] down.\" Which is more than you can say about some members of Koog's current squad.</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"I still believe that we did underperform and the challenge for the players and myself is to perform to our ability. When we do we are a match for everybody.\" - Kelvin Koogan keeps believing. Well, somebody's got to.</p> <p><strong>I HEARD (AND THEN MADE UP) A RUMOUR</strong></p> <p>Over the bank holiday weekend, it was reported that Sol Campbell and Ronald de Boer would both be wearing Manchester United's unique new woollen woollysportsweater (\u00a9, TM, etc.) come the end of the week, just in time to make the registration deadline for Big Cup. Sadly for United fans, the Fiver must report that this does not appear to be the case.</p> <p>According to the Star - and we have total faith in them - sources close to Campbell insist that there has been no contact with the Old Trafford club regarding a \u00a39m move, despite claims in the Mirror to the contrary. And although the excellent De Boer had been quoted on onefootball.com as saying he had \"received a call from United last week from Alex Ferguson\", his own website today contradicted this report: \"These rumours simply aren't true. This weekend I have spoken to both Barcelona's coach and president with a view to sorting out my present situation with the club.\"</p> <p>Who can you trust? A disillusioned Fiver can't tell you - we don't know. Mind you, onefootball.com haven't done too badly in terms of free publicity - it's well worth getting it wrong if a major international footballer pooh-poohs your report in front of the world's media. Well, we're not adverse to a bit of a leg up either, so here goes. \"Alex Caldwell, the manager of Elgin City, gave me a quick tinkle on the old dog and bone last week,\" an excited Zinedine Zidane told the Fiver over the phone about, er, five minutes ago. \"I don't know what will happen yet, but I can tell you this for nothing - I'm well interested!\" Now, when do we start counting our column inches?</p> <p><strong>THE RUMOUR MILL</strong></p> <p>Diego Maradona could be about to return to competitive football after provisionally signing for Argentine Second Division side All Boys.

  "<p>The London Stock Exchange today rejected an \u00a3808m takeover bid from Sweden's OM Gruppen which threatens to scupper its proposed tie-up with Germany's Deutsche B\u00f6rse.</p> <p>The London Stock Exchange (LSE) said it had \"no hesitation in rejecting\" the approach from OM, adding that it offered \"wholly inadequate value for shareholders\". </p> <p>OM, which operates the Swedish stock exchange, formally bid \u00a327.19 per LSE share today after days of speculation that it was set to mount a rival offer for the LSE. </p> <p>In May the LSE announced it would create Europe's biggest share trading exchange after merging with its German counterpart, subject to shareholders' approval. </p> <p>However, the shareholder vote on the proposed merger, which was to have taken place on September 14, has now been adjourned in view of OM's announcement. </p> <p>The board will write to shareholders setting out their detailed reasons for rejecting the approach. In the meantime shareholders are being advised to take no action. </p> <p>Don Cruickshank, chairman of the LSE, said: \"While OM recognises our market position and brand strength, their offer does little to advance our strategic goals in Europe. </p> <p>\"Our customers want European consolidation, which we believe is the best way to deliver value to our shareholders.\" </p> <p>OM countered by saying its offer would ensure the LSE's position as the leading European exchange for investors worldwide by integrating costs and by bringing together two complementary companies. </p> <p>Olof Stenhammer, chairman and founder of OM, said: \"This is a substantial offer for the LSE from OM, the world leader in technology solutions for trading exchanges and the first listed company to own a major European Stock Exchange.\" </p> <p>Mr Stenhammer criticised the proposed LSE-Deutsche B\u00f6rse merger plan, which he said \"squanders the potential\" for the LSE. </p> <p>OM added: \"The proposed [...] merger is founded on an outdated concept of merging two nationally based operations with limited regard to the technological and commercial changes in global equity markets.\" </p> <p>It said the combination of the LSE's market liquidity and OM's cutting-edge technology and commercial drive would provide the LSE with the key elements for growth. </p> <p>OM added that, were its bid to be successful, the combined group would generate cost savings of around \u00a330m a year within four years. </p> <p>The proposed LSE-Deutsche B\u00f6rse tie-up has run into opposition from a number of quarters in the UK over fears that it will result in the loss of London's position as the main European share trading centre. </p> <p>OM today sought to allay fears that its bid would result in a similar loss of business for London, saying the move would ensure the capital's pre-eminent position in both blue chip and high growth stocks. </p> <p>It said its proposal would offer \"clarity and simplicity by avoiding regulatory compromise\", with the FSA remaining the sole regulatory authority for the LSE. </p> <p>The offer from OM is expected to spark off a \"white knight\" bid from the Deutsche B\u00f6rse as it tries to keep its LSE tie-up on track. </p> <p>However, it is believed that Euronext, the exchange to be formed out of the Amsterdam, Paris and Brussels exchanges, is also considering its options regarding a move for the LSE. </p> <p>Founded in 1985, OM operated originally as a purely derivatives exchange but two years ago merged with the Stockholm stock exchange and is now worth \u00a32.6bn. </p> <p><strong>Useful links:</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/theissues/article/0,6512,360695,00.html\">The issue explained: stock exchange mergers</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.exchange.de/INTERNET/EXCHANGE/index_e.htm\">Deutsche B\u00f6rse</a><br><a href=\"http://ir.omgroup.com/news/pressdetail/61\">OM Gruppen</a><br><a href=\"http://www.londonstockexchange.com/\">London Stock Exchange</a><br></p>",
  "Two days into the towering inferno that blanked out Moscow television screens and deprived 10m Muscovites of their daily soap opera fix, the pinnacle of Europe's tallest structure was wobbling last night - a cruel symbol of how Russia's once soaring ambitions are tumbling into hubris and humiliation. <p>The Ostankino television tower, rising 540 metres (1,771ft) to dominate the capital's skyline, was until Sunday a monument to Russian power, prestige and hi-tech can-do, just as - until two weeks ago - the Kursk nuclear submarine was seen as a measure of Russia's military prowess. </p> <p>Gutted by fire and in danger of collapsing into a mangled heap of steel, cable and ferro-concrete, the TV tower yesterday made yet another eloquent mockery of President Vladimir Putin's pledges to make Russia great again. </p> <p>In contrast to his aloof, delayed reaction to the Kursk disaster, however, Mr Putin was quick yesterday to label the TV tower blaze a metaphor for the state of the nation. </p> <p>\"This emergency highlights the condition of our vital facilities as well as of the entire nation,\" he declared. \"Only economic development will enable us to prevent such calamities in the future.\" </p> <p>Moscow's mayor, Yuri Luzhkov, said at first there was no risk of the tower collapsing, before changing tack and warning of \"a large danger\". The wobbling spire of the secular cathedral was not a problem, argued Anvar Shamuzafarov, chief of the national construction committee, as 300 firefighters finally extinguished the blaze last night. \"All deviations are within the norm,\" he said. </p> <p><b> Tilting</b><br> </p> <p>But a Moscow city surveyor said the tip of the tower was tilting 6ft off centre. The main fear was that the 149 steel cables holding up the slender 33-year-old concrete structure could buckle and send at least parts of it crashing. </p> <p>\"The cables are weakened, but not broken,\" said Vyacheslav Mulishkin, deputy head of the Russian fire department. </p> <p>There are few prouder symbols in Moscow of once-hailed Soviet supremacy than the Ostankino tower. Erected in 1967 at the height of the arms and space race with the US and to mark the Russian revolution's birthday, the north Moscow monument, with its revolving Seventh Heaven restaurant commanding panoramic views of the city, instantly overtook New York's Empire State Building as the world's tallest structure. </p> <p>That was then. Ten years of post-Soviet meltdown, retreat from empire, mass impoverishment and colossal corruption have turned Russia into a vast accident waiting to happen. </p> <p>The heyday of the Soviet space effort has given way to a crisis where the Mir space station is on its last legs, forever being patched up, and open to commercial offers from abroad. Latest estimates suggest it needs hundreds of millions of dollars to prevent it falling from its orbit and crashing to earth. </p> <p>August is habitually Russia's cruellest month and this year illustrates the rule - a bomb in the heart of Moscow, the sinking of the Kursk, the towering inferno. Last August brought more bombs in the city and the start of the Chechen war. The previous August brought the financial crash. And so on. </p> <p>But while the submarine sinking convulses Russia with grief and hijacks the world's emotions, and the dramatic pictures of the tower fire dominate the global TV screen, the sad fact of contemporary Russia is that disaster has become a drab and daily fixture. Yesterday alone, in addition to the Ostankino blaze, there were two booby-trap bombs in Grozny, the Chechen capital, a methane gas explosion at a mine in the Urals, and the bodies of two young conscripts were found north of Moscow. They had just shot themselves after going awol from their units. </p> <p>For the professional catastrophists employed by the government's ministry of emergencies come the predictions that endemic bungling, combined with lack of money, will lead to radiation and toxic alerts in the years ahead, as well as air crashes, pipeline ruptures and building collapses. </p> <p>Last week the Izvestiya newspaper reported that more than 1,000 servicemen die every year in peacetime accidents. The military prosecutor's office puts the toll from training mishaps, exploding ordnance and vehicle crashes at 1,100, though activist mothers campaigning for better conditions for their conscript sons put the figure at triple that. \"Natural wastage,\" the Russian military calls it. </p> <p>The daily litany of misfortune generates alarmist, populist politics playing on paranoia, conspiracy theories and fear. </p> <p>In the wake of the Kursk disaster, a \"red-brown\" group of nationalist and communist politicians, writers and editors issued a manifesto for \"national salvation\" to combat Russia's \"spiritual paralysis and despair. In these days of mourning, we are very clearly aware of the scale of the trouble into which Russia has been plunged,\" they proclaimed. \"Our people have been waging a great war for a decade, losing one million of our population every year, and leaving burning cities, blown-up apartment buildings, crashed airplanes, sunken ships, and devastated, depopulated regions, as well as countless graves of our compatriots behind on the battlefield.\" </p> <p>Russia was at \"war for the right to call itself Russia, to control the territory between three oceans, to speak its native language, to worship its holy things, and to honour its heroes and forebears... trying with its last strength to put ships out to sea and squadrons in the air, to pump oil and natural gas, to heat the houses, educate the children, nurse the orphans, and to keep faith in its sovereignty and inviolability, and in the inevitable Russian Victory\". </p> <p>Rather than victory, the current mood is one of demoralised defeatism. Even in the holiday season dozens of people are committing suicide; picking and eating poison mushrooms or bingeing on vodka and then drowning themselves in Moscow's rivers and lakes. </p> <p>President Putin's appeal to Russians is that he represents to them the best option for fashioning order from this chaos, stability from mayhem. But while he promises a restoration of greatness, he also told the grieving relatives of the Kursk crewmen last week that Russia had to learn to live within its means. And while the 118 were entombed in the submarine at the bottom of the Barents sea, the president debated Russia's brain-drain with prominent scientists and told them that only one in 20 businesses in the country were using modern equipment. </p> <p><b> Trapped</b><br> </p> <p> And if navy manpower and equipment were not up to mounting an effective rescue for the 118 seamen on the Kursk, so the 300 firefighters in northern Moscow yesterday were struggling to reach at least two people trapped in a lift about 1,000ft up the tower. As many as four people may have died in the gutted structure. </p> <p>All the evidence yesterday suggested that the conflagration had been sparked by negligence and refusals to heed warnings. The fire department said that even when first built, the tower had failed to satisfy the safety regulations. An inspection in May resulted in it being denied the required safety paperwork since its power supply system was 30% overloaded, making the kind of short circuit that occurred on Sunday afternoon virtually inevitable.</p>",
  "Dictators and torturers across the world may be sleeping a little less soundly these days. Not because of a sudden attack of conscience, but because Labour - through its recently published draft legislation - is helping to tip the international balance away from impunity and toward justice. <p>Our draft bill will put Britain's full weight behind the establishment of the International Criminal Court (ICC) which will be a giant step forward for human rights and the rule of international law. For the first time there will be an international body to try individuals responsible for the worst crimes known to humankind. Future Pol Pots and Pinochets should be warned: merchants of oppression, atrocity and genocide, however powerful or feared in their own country, can be brought to justice. And through scrupulously fair trials which can place the blame on individuals rather than communities, the ICC will promote peace and reconciliation. </p> <p>Based in The Hague, the ICC will build on the model and jurisprudence established to try Nazis in Nuremberg and the current war crimes tribunals for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia. But uniquely, the ICC will have a forward-looking and potentially global mandate. </p> <p>The ICC will deal with three clearly defined offences: genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. It will have jurisdiction over crimes committed after its establishment - not over past atrocities. The main responsibility for punishing crimes will remain that of nation states. The ICC will only intervene if the countries concerned have proved unable or unwilling genuinely to investigate the crimes themselves. This might happen where conflict has led to the collapse of the local judicial system or where a dictatorial government refuses to punish its own abusers. </p> <p>Except when the UN Security Council refers situations to the court, the ICC will only have jurisdiction over crimes committed in countries which have ratified the court's statute, or by their nationals. It will look to states to provide evidence, arrest suspects and enforce the sentences it passes down. </p> <p>Like any body which emerges from many years of extensive negotiation involving the international community, the ICC will be neither a magic wand nor an all-powerful Big Brother. But because it is the product of international agreement, rather than unilateral initiative, the ICC's decisions will represent the will, and demand the respect, of the whole world. </p> <p>Under Labour, Britain has already proved itself one of the court's strongest supporters. We proved it by our pivotal role at the successful Rome conference that adopted the ICC Treaty. We proved it by helping to give the court the power to punish not only those who massacre civilians but also those who commit sexual violence or use child soldiers. And we continue to prove it by doing our best to mobilise international support for the court, including by lobbying reluctant countries such as the US. </p> <p> The legislation will enable Britain to provide maximum assistance to the ICC. For example, it will allow the law-enforcement authorities to identify, arrest and, through a streamlined process, surrender war crimes suspects to The Hague. It will allow us to gather evidence, freeze assets and enforce court sentences. </p> <p>And it will empower our courts to prosecute war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide committed here or by UK nationals overseas. This means that we will always be able to fulfil our responsibility to prosecute such crimes. </p> <p>Our ambition is to be one of the court's founding members. The bill will enable Britain to ratify the Rome statute of the ICC and so push up the number of ratifications towards the 60 countries needed for the statute to come into force and for the ICC to begin its work. </p> <p>We are publishing the bill in draft for comments by October 12 because we want to maximise agreement before its parliamentary introduction, especially among those with particular interests or expertise. There is widespread, cross-party support for the ICC. The more civil society and government can cooperate over the details in the bill implementing the treaty, the greater the chance of making quick parliamentary progress. </p> <p>That will also depend upon cooperation between government and opposition parties. I have written to them and to a wide range of parliamentarians asking for their comments on the draft. We are genuinely open to suggested changes which improve the bill without destroying it. My objective is to have a bill which is in the best possible shape and enjoys maximum cross-party consensus ready for introduction as soon as parliamentary time allows. </p> <p>But it is important that the bill does not get caught in the middle of the kind of parliamentary filibustering or obstruction of other contentious legislation in which opposition parties have always indulged. A commitment by all the parties to the smooth passage of this bill would be a clear message to the world's tyrants that the British people are united in wanting international justice. </p> <p> Peter Hain is minister of state at the Foreign Office.

  "The right for a baby, conceived after a father's death, to have his name on the birth certificate; the right for young people in care (and not in receipt of child benefit) to have a nest egg from the Treasury when they become adults; and that most tortured of decisions, the right of \"Mary\" not to be separated from her Siamese twin, \"Jodie\", even though this may mean death for both - supported by the twins' parents but rejected by Mr Justice Johnson - all are issues which highlight, yet again, that it is not just in the aftermath of a child abuse scandal or some terrible misdemeanour by \"bad\" boys and girls that the issue of children's rights have to be addressed properly in a democratic society. <p>Over 100 organisations, including the National Confederation of Parent and Teacher Associations and several dozen MPs had hoped that this summer, after more than a decade of campaigning, spurred on by Sir Ronald Waterhouse's report on abuse in Welsh children's homes, the government would appoint a children's commissioner for England. A commissioner is on the agenda for Scotland while Northern Ireland's Human Rights Commission has a remit which covers the young. </p> <p>Eighteen commissioners or ombudsmen are in place around the world including those in Australia, Guatemala and Denmark. In Spain, the city of Madrid has had an ombudsman since 1996 with wide powers including the clout to investigate individual cases and the ability to issue warnings (for instance, on inaccurate images of the young in the media). Issues tackled include immigrant and marginilised children; children's free time and the development of children's councils in the city. (Perhaps one way of encouraging adult participation later in the democratic process?) So how do we measure up in England? </p> <p>Labour is, of course, committed to building a human rights culture and modernising government. It has invested hugely in childcare and alleviating child poverty. It even promised a commissioner and a minister for children in its 1992 manifesto. All of which makes its bout of midsummer madness on the establishment of an English commissioner all the more inexplicable. </p> <p>Under the new Care Standards Act, England will have, instead, a children's rights director. He or she will be concerned only with the 200,000 children living away from home, for instance, in residential care and boarding schools. The other 11m young people under the age of 18 will remain without an equivalent representative voice. The government also tried to foist a director with slightly wider powers on the Welsh Assembly but to its credit, it is having none of it. Instead, the assembly is pushing for a commissioner with a role closer to that defined by its health and social services committee earlier this year. </p> <p>The Welsh commissioner, as defined by the committee, would promote the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (which includes political, and economic goals); require impact statements to assess the affect of policies on the young; conduct an annual audit on the state of Wales's children; encourage research; monitor government actions; raise the profile of the young and act as champion, watchdog and whistleblower. A commissioner would also have the power to inquire into breaches of children's rights and demand action. \"At the heart of our need for a commissioner,\" the committee concluded, \"Is the need for all of us to listen to all children and young people; to have a genuine commitment to reflecting their views.\" </p> <p> It sounds like common sense - so why has the government backed off in England? Does an ombudsman require too much administrative upheaval? Or can it be fear of a certain section of the population who view children's rights as a euphemism for infant anarchy and adults wronged? Those who believe that \"rights\" basically boils down to smacking - and that's nobody's grown-up business but their own? </p> <p>Moira Rayner, a New Zealand lawyer with international experience in children's rights, now has three years to challenge such head-in-the- sand ideas - and to add to the pressure on government to appoint an English commissioner with strong statutory powers. Rayner is director of the newly created Office of the Children's Rights Commissioner for London. </p> <p>One of the least publicised promises made in the mayoral election was to appoint \"a children's champion\" in the assembly. Livingstone has yet to fill the post. Nevertheless, Rayner's work (guided by a panel of young people and partly funded by the lottery) is already underway. She is preparing a report on the state of London's children and (with Livingstone's officers) drawing up a strategy. \"If London can get it right for children,\" runs her argument. \"Any major city can.\" </p> <p>\"Children's rights are often confused with civil rights - for instance, the right to freedom of association,\" Rayner says. \"What they're actually about is social rights - the right to a decent quality of life. And the right for a child's views to be treated seriously when important decisions are made about the society in which we all live. They don't cancel out adult responsibility but they do encourage fair play and cooperation.\" </p> <p>London has 1.74m young people under 18. Twice the national proportion live in workless households. But Rayner is keen that the government's obligations aren't restricted to minimising risk and tackling poverty, important though those goals are. What also matter, she argues, are positive measures to stimulate the well-being of the young, for instance, in transport, the environment and health. (The NSPCC too has long argued for well-being indicators to establish a coordinated national measure of child development.) </p> <p>In July, with little fanfare, the government established a children's unit to coordinate efforts. Instead of being anchored in the Cabinet Office alongside the women's unit and the social exclusion unit, as organisations such as the NSPCC had hoped, the children's unit has been sited in the Department of Education and Employment, backed by a cross-governmental committee chaired by Paul Boateng, at the Home Office. </p> <p>The government has also said it will monitor the progress of the Welsh Children's Commissioner before taking a decision on an English equivalent - although the worldwide evidence already exists. A clear strong voice is missing. As Sir William Utting, former Chief Inspector of Social Services, says, \"Governments are dominated by the pushes and pulls of an electorate in which only grown-ups have votes, and issues about children are, as a result, continuously overshadowed... Children need a strong independent office to represent their interests comprehensively and to ensure that public and private agencies deliver what law and public policy require.\" </p> <p>That is understood and accepted in Scotland, Ireland and Wales - why not in England too? </p> <p> <a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\"> comment@theguardian.com </a></p>",
  "In one of the Thin Man movies, William Powell is waiting for Myrna Loy in a bar: she is late, he is drinking. When she arrives, she looks at his Martini and says: \"How many of those have you had?\" <p>\"Four,\" he says, morosely. She calls over the waiter. \"Bring us six Martinis,\" she says. \"One more for him and five for me.\" </p> <p>This should be a defining moment in the history of the gender politics of booze. Not only is she drinking (and as much as him) but she's ordering, looking fabulous, being extremely funny and extremely shocking. </p> <p>But for the next 50 years, in the UK at least, it was back to \"a white wine for the lady\", tall glasses not proper beer mugs, halves when you wanted a pint, never being offered the wine list or given the wine to sniff and swirl and taste, even when it was you who ordered it. Then came Bridget Jones and the acknowledgment of a great truth: that while men were drinking beer and vodka to get through the miseries of life, women were buying wine (Jacob's Creek Chardonnay) by the bucketload. </p> <p>Now all this is coming together in a fantastically expectable cocktail of Old Sexism, New Sexism and consumer marketing. Let me explain: Tesco yesterday announced it has appointed its first all-female wine development team, \"charged with making wine more women-friendly\". </p> <p>So how they are going to do this exactly? Are they going to introduce more organic wines - very friendly, as they give less of a hangover? Are they going to encourage small-scale producers, so wine-growing areas are not ruined by mile on mile of industrial scale vine-growing, with the concomitant chemicals, machinery and destruction of the environment? No? Well, are they going to start using pretty pink labels with nice big writing on? </p> <p>Not quite, but nearly. They are going to promote \"lighter, fruitier wines\" (Blue Nun! Every girl's favourite!), as well as \"cut through the mumbo jumbo\" and \"pointless technical detail\" on the labels - such as the vintage, the grape and where the wine comes from. This information, according to Helen McGinn, one of Tesco's wine women, is the go-faster stripe of the wine industry, designed to pander to men and flatter them into thinking they know what they are talking about. </p> <p>In other words, dear little women need wine dumbed down for them and silly old men just try to make themselves feel better by knowing things. Double whammy. </p> <p>The second part is backed up by Tesco's suggestion that women \"park\" their partners in the wine aisle (a cr\u00e8che for bored husbands) while they do the serious shopping. \"They know choosing a single bottle will keep them occupied for at least an hour,\" says the Tesco wine maestro, demonstrating how acceptable it is now to infantilise men and sneer at anything requiring knowledge. </p> <p>According to Tesco, 78% of women think men's selection procedures are pretentious, but the alternative is dismal: 52% of women think \"the most important aspect of wine is how it tastes and not its vintage or country of origin\". Oh well: at least the other 48% realise that how wine tastes depends precisely on its vintage and its country of origin. </p> <p>\"Women want wine that tastes good irrespective of where it comes from,\" McGinn says. This is a sliding past the truth and beauty about wine - its fabulous variety and changeability - and looks suspiciously like a route to McDonald's-isation. Do we really want not just every bottle and every year of a particular \"light, fruity wine\" but every \"light, fruity wine\" to taste, like quarter-pounders, exactly the same? </p> <p>I don't see why information should be assumed to be mumbo jumbo and why do we need to be told what we like? I suspect imminent dumbing down in the wine aisle, using \"what women want\" as an excuse and assuming women to be too stupid to mind or even notice. </p> <p>Meanwhile men are insulted (because insulting men is a free-for-all nowadays and a cheap way to get women on your side) and we are told we're being liberated from a male-dominated tradition in the process. I'd rather be male-dominated than corporation-dominated any day. Men are easier to argue with. Oh, pooh to domination anyway. Make mine six Martinis.</p>",
  "There is a crisis in the Leicester museum service this week, of passionate interest to the museum community if not - on the face of it - to many people outside. <p>The city has already closed one museum and lost some of its most senior museum staff. From September 1 its smaller museums will cut opening times by two hours, and the main museum by half an hour. The collection care and exhibitions budgets have been cut by over 50%, funds for education stand at a tiny \u00a38,000. </p> <p>\"It is an absolutely catastrophic situation, and the most depressing thing is that it's not a freak. It's an extreme but typical example of what's happening all over the country,\" says David Barrie, director of the Art Fund, an independent charity to which desperate museums are turning in increasing numbers to plug some of their funding gaps. </p> <p>The crisis in the British regional museum service is exemplified by the dilemma of the director of a once nationally admired museum service, who is trying to find more cuts in a service already slashed to the bone - the budget has been cut by 15 % in real terms since 1997. National figures show a landslip which is threatening to become an avalanche of jobs lost, hours cut, treasures crumbling and, ultimately, museums closing. </p> <p>\"Some museums are going to close,\" says Maurice Davies, deputy director of the Museums Association. \"There is a strong public expectation that when things go into a museum they are going to stay there for ever, on display to the people. That is not going to be true.\" </p> <p>Mr Davies's is one of many voices warning against complacency. Studies show that even those who do not visit museums value them and expect them always to be there. But without considerably more vocal public support for museums to give them political clout in local and national funding debates, the handful of museums which have already closed will be the tip of the iceberg. </p> <p>\"It's not just us, it's all over the country, but that's not much comfort in our situation,\" says Margaret Warhurst, director of the Norton Priory museum in Runcorn, which is struggling to cope with a 20% local authority grant cut. \"It is very hard to see free admission being talked about for the huge national museums in London when our local residents, in an area which is 16th on the national deprivation index, still have to pay to come into our museum. We will survive this year by hook or crook. But we cannot go on like this.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile objects in collections are literally rotting, particularly those items which are stored out of the public view - up to 90% of the collection in many museums. </p> <p>Sharyn Manitta, a freelance conservator and a founder member of the Institute of Conservators, says: \"This is a huge, huge problem, a multi-million pound problem. I have had curators in tears in my studio because they want to do the best they possibly can for their collections, but they have not got the money or the resources, and they have no influence over the financial decisions being taken. </p> <p>\"There are objects - costumes, paintings, furniture, archaeological objects - literally dropping to pieces in museum stores.\" Three quarters of museums now believe their in-house conservation service is inadequate. </p> <p>\"Conservators all over the country are losing their jobs, and it is a completely false economy,\" says Ms Manitta. \"Putting off conservation work means that far more expensive work will have to be done further down the road.\" </p> <p>Mr Barrie is more brutal. \"The expertise of the people who know about these things, and who know how to care for them, is being squandered and thrown aside. It is a national tragedy.\" </p> <p>There are few national figures on the plight of museums, in a field fragmented between national museums directly funded by the government, local authority museums and independent collections. Resource, the body formed by the merger of the museums and galleries commission and the libraries and archives commission, is collecting statistics on the scale of the problem. However the most recent report, published earlier this year, and evidence from Area Museum Councils, from the Museums Association, and from the Art Fund, suggest a national pattern in which thousands of opening hours have been cut and hundreds of staff lost in compulsory or voluntary redundancies. </p> <p>There are estimated to be over 80m visits each year to museums and galleries in the UK, but the report showed a 4% drop in visits in the year 1997-8 (partly explained by competition from new lottery- funded visitor attractions) and a 2.5% drop in the number of full-time staff to 12,590. </p> <p>The situation now is undoubtedly even worse. Those figures were collected just before or just after the 1997 local government reorganisation when the impact had yet to be felt of new unitary authorities taking on a huge range of museum responsibilities, or county wide museum services - as in Leicestershire - being split between town and county councils. </p> <p>Of the Area Museum Councils - which are funded through Resource by the department of culture - contacted by the Guardian, Yorkshire and Humberside, the North West, West and East Midlands, Eastern Region and the South East, all reported budget cuts and staff numbers falling in museums in their area, and a slight but noticeable drop in visitor numbers. The South West, which has dozens of tiny independent museums, is being supported by an army of unpaid volunteers - the award-winning Lyme Regis museum is entirely voluntarily staffed. </p> <p>Outright closures are rare, but in the last year the York Story, a popular heritage centre run by the York Museums Service, and the Wygston's House costume museum in one of the oldest houses in Leicester simply locked their doors. Others, like the ancient Stranger's Hall in Norwich, are no longer permanently staffed but open by appointment only on a couple of days a week. Museums in Ipswich and Exeter have fought off the worst threatened cuts this year but are braced for further assaults. </p> <p>The Museums Association has received recent alarm calls from museums in Luton, Billericay, and Portsmouth, from nationally important museums in Durham and Lancashire, from collections in pros perous Cheshire and in the more deprived Hackney Downs in east London. </p> <p>Most cuts are so gradual - half an hour here, half a day there, a senior curator with a lifetime of experience taking voluntary redundancy to be replaced by somebody younger and cheaper - that the scale of the problem is only gradually becoming apparent. \"It's death by a thousand cuts,\" says David Barrie. \"Taken individually these cuts might not seem disastrous, but they could add up to a national catastrophe.\" </p> <p>In Leicester the council leader, Ross Wilmott, is taking the flak for cuts in a service which he genuinely believes is essential to the vitality of his city. \"But Leicester is one of the worst funded local authorities in the country,\" he says. \"We have lost the equivalent of \u00a3200m in central government support. We are making representations about that, but we're certainly not going to get more money tomorrow. Meanwhile we have had to plough money into our schools, and that has had to be our priority. But we have done our very best to protect the museums service. The museums - except one - are still open, there are exhibitions, things are still happening. We've just acquired two new paintings by Stanley Spencer.\" </p> <p>The department of culture, media and sport is now finally admitting the plight of English regional museums and preparing to tackle it - post-devolution Welsh, Scottish and Northern Irish museums have their own problems and their own funding structures. More money for regional museums was earmarked in the chancellor's spending forecast, but the sector will have to wait until next month for the detailed allocation. Buried under the \u00a350m increase for sports and the \u00a3100m increase for the arts, there was a promise of \"a \u00a310 million funding package for regional museum, library and archive collections\". </p> <p>It is already clear that the money, though welcome, will not be enough to stop the rot. The indications from museum sources this week are that after the money earmarked for regional collections designated of national importance is taken away, the promised extra money will amount to less than \u00a35m. </p> <p>\"If you divvied that up evenly, every museum could have about \u00a35,000,\" says Maurice Davies of the Museums Association. \"Nobody could claim this will go any way to solving the problem. The best we can take it for is an earnest [sign] of goodwill.\" </p> <p>David Fleming, director of Tyne and Wear Museums, is unimpressed at the government's extra money for regional museums - his museum service, or Birmingham's or Glasgow's, could swallow the entire sum without plugging the gaps in the service. </p> <p>\"This has to be a problem for national government; it cannot be left as a problem for local politicians to decide how to make cuts in a non-statutory service. The extent of the underfunding and cuts means there is now a deficit in the country's museums of tens of millions of pounds, probably hundreds of millions. Our museums, in common with the big local authority ones, are now a third to a half under-resourced compared to 15 years ago. </p> <p>\"The irony is that at that time, by and large, we were doing a very poor job. Now we are doing everything we should be doing, transforming the outlook of museums and their relationship with their local communities, but we simply have not got the money to do the job properly.\" </p> <p>The anomaly in this situation is that the vast bulk of museum funding comes not from the culture department, but from John Prescott's sprawling department of transport, environment and the regions. The culture department funds only the main, \"national\" museums - mostly in London - while local authorities fund the rest of the country's museums. </p> <p>The dazzle of the huge Millennium- and Heritage Lottery- funded openings (including the Wallace, Dulwich and Somerset House galleries in London, the Lowry in Salford and the Walsall gallery), the extraordinary success of Tate Modern, as well as handsome new galleries for existing museums including Reading and Exeter, has obscured the truth about the crumbling backbone of the national museum and gallery service. The independent museums have their own problems, but the biggest crisis is in the local authority funded museums. Museums, unlike schools, rubbish collection and libraries, are not a statutory requirement for local authorities. In the annual turf wars for increasingly squeezed local authority resources, museums are losing out year on year. </p> <p>The government's new museums supremo is Matthew Evans, chairman of Faber and Faber publishers and now Lord Evans and chairman of Resource. He has warned museums they must change or die, and is urging them to think the unthinkable, to get their collections out of store and into the community - by selling or giving away duplicate objects if need be. He has warned them to specialise, to cooperate with one another, to break down the barriers with non museum visitor attractions such as heritage centres. But privately he is now convinced, as someone who came to the area as a sceptic, that the sector needs a lot more money. </p> <p>The museum industry knows it will have to become more politically astute in matching itself to the government's objectives and tapping into other sources of funding. \"There is other money out there,\" says Rosemary Elwes, secretary of the committee of Area Museum Councils. \"There's all sorts of development and education and regeneration and city challenge money, and museums should be ideally placed to take advantage of it. Strategic thinking and planning has never been more urgently needed.\" </p> <p>\"New staff are being taken on to fulfill what is seen as the government agenda, especially in areas such as outreach and social inclusion,\" she adds. \"There is nothing wrong with this, but it should not be at the expense of care of the collections.\" </p> <p>At Norton Priory Margaret Warhurst sighs wearily. She and her board have investigated every conceivable avenue of grant and sponsorship funding. Her museum has already completed a Heritage Lottery project, a new gallery to house its unique medieval wooden statue of Saint Christopher, and she cannot realistically see another lottery grant on the horizon. There is European regional money up for grabs, and a plethora of challenge funds already operated by the department and Resource. </p> <p>\"The problem is it takes so much time, when already there aren't enough people to do the work and so much of our time is taken up merely surviving, to find out about and apply for these schemes - and then there's no guarantee of success in the end.\" </p> <p>Nobody is even quite sure how many museums there are in Britain. The Museums Association has 700 members, Resource knows of 2,500, 1800 of them registered museums, and the trade bible, the Museums Yearbook, lists 3,000 museums and visitor centres. These range from the Cat Museum in Harrow - most recent recorded annual visitor numbers, 500 - to HM Prison Service Museum in Rugby, admission free and open by appointment only, which clocked up 7,000 visitors in 1994. </p> <p>David Barrie, who has just been appointed to the board of Resource, begs the government to cherish them before it is too late. \"Even people who do not visit museums themselves benefit from their existence, in the education services they offer, in the inspiration they provide, in the works of art and books and films which are indirectly sparked by museum collections. If you allow the flame of learning which they represent to gutter out, these will suffer in turn. The country will be immeasurably and irreperably impoverished.\" </p> <p>Additional research by Rebecca Ley </p>",
  "A tiny field mouse, so tough it is one of only four land mammals that can survive the cold of the high Arctic, has struck fear into the remote Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard. <p>Microtus epiroticus, which lives alongside polar bears, reindeer and arctic foxes, has been dubbed the \"killer mouse\" because of tiny tapeworm larvae it carries that are harmless to its host but kill humans by causing liver cysts. </p> <p>Two scientists who were studying the arctic fox have tested positive for the presence of the larvae. If the larvae develop into adult tapeworms, they could prove fatal. </p> <p>So alarmed is Lasse Loennum, who directs university studies on Spitsbergen, the largest of the Svalbard islands, that he is writing to 100 former students who took part in a research study on the mouse, urging them to have similar blood tests. </p> <p>The students will have to be checked regularly for 15 years if the parasite has entered their system. If cysts are not removed, 90% of victims die. Several cases are diagnosed each year in eastern Europe. </p> <p>The Spitsbergen mouse became the subject of research because scientists were astonished that it could survive where other Arctic animals introduced from places like Greenland had perished from the cold. The mouse came from northern Greece via Russia about 80 years ago and managed to get a foothold in a now-abandoned mining town. </p> <p>The larva develops into a tapeworm in a fox or dog that eats the mouse. The tapeworm produces thousands of eggs excreted in fox droppings. These survive for months, and sometimes years, until picked up by a new host - which can be another mouse or a human. </p> <p>Carl Kilander, senior environment official in Spitsbergen, said: \"The eggs can be ingested from mushrooms people pick, or from drinking water from the streams. We are advising people to boil mushrooms and water.\" </p> <p>Children can pick up the infection from stroking pet dogs. Public health officials decided last week to offer blood tests to all children should their parents request it. One hundred local adults have had blood tests, but none has proved positive so far. </p> <p>Mr Kilander said: \"We advised people to set traps and try and eradicate the mice, but scientists say it will be impossible. If the Arctic cold cannot wipe them out, we certainly will not be able to.\"</p>",
  "Polly Toynbee writes about \"hate mail\" from the US (Comment, August 25) in response to her previous article (The lesson from America is that Europe is our only hope, August 23). But I doubt very much that it is representative of American opinion. The language and tone of the email she quotes is that of a fairly extreme minority. Most Americans would not even be aware of her article. By far the most likely explanation for this \"avalanche of emails\" is that her column was posted on the internet in forums read by people of strongly anti-liberal views. (It was in fact posted to at least one, the newsgoup alt.politics.liberalism.) <p>An interesting story is the way the internet can generate \"campaigns\", including very unrepresentative ones, because it makes it easier for those with extreme views to find, encourage, and support each other. Another is the way the media are unprepared for the effects of the internet on their ways assessing opinion. <br><b>Jeff Dalton </b><br>University of Edinburgh <br><a href=\"mailto:J.Dalton@ed.ac.uk\">J.Dalton@ed.ac.uk</a> </p> <p> </p> <p>\u0095 I liked Polly Toynbee's analysis in her original article. During the previous weeks I too watched the US presidential campaign - the entire party conventions live on TV, in the UK. I am not sure why so much TV time is given to events in America. I did not realise, until I experienced it, the amount of attention that the media gives to the US in UK. I wish the US was able to do the same about the events in Europe and the world. Our children know every detail about football players in America, but ask them where Hong Kong is and they may well say Latin America. <br><b>Steven Kadivar </b><br> Woodside, USA <br> <a href=\"mailto:skadivar@hotmail.com\">skadivar@hotmail.com</a> </p> <p>\u0095 Europe alone cannot act as a counterweight to the US. Only the concerted authority of the rest of the world, acting through the UN, can stand up to overweening might of the US. To strengthen the rule of international law we need \"coalitions of the willing\", involving developing countries and Europe working together, as over the statute for the International Criminal Court and the landmines ban. We also need a robust system of democratic accountability at a global level, so that all countries and international agencies can be challenged to live up to their commitments under the UN charter, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and international law. </p> <p>Next month world leaders meet in New York to discuss the future of the UN. This is an opportunity to strengthen democratic accountability in international decision-making, so that no country, however powerful, is above the law. This is our only hope for tackling global climate change, nuclear proliferation, third world debt and poverty. <br><b>Titus Alexander </b><br>Chair, Charter 99 <br><a href=\"mailto:info@charter99.org\">info@charter99.org</a> </p> <p> </p> <p>\u0095 It's sad but entirely predictable that Polly Toynbee's excellent article should produce such an ill considered and rude response. The highly selfish nature of US politics is down to two main reasons, the highly flawed \"democratic\" system, in which power is wielded by corporate America, rather than the people; and the complacency of a large proportion of the population, who cannot see the difference between economic, technological and military world leadership, and moral world leadership - despite the appalling record the US has on environmental issues, arms control, gun laws and so on. </p> <p>It is not a case of \"my Europe right or wrong\". We can build a Europe that is strong, democratic and environmentally responsible, and must do if the world's major problems are to be dealt with internationally. <br><b>Joe Charnock</b><br>Boston, USA</p>",
  "The exclusion of billions who are poor, illiterate, rural or non-English speaking from the evolving global information infrastructure has serious effects and the digital divide is fast becoming a critical issue for developing countries. Mark Atkinson is right to question the hype surrounding information and communication technology and the world's poor (Poor need penicillin before Pentiums, August 28). The rhetoric of political and corporate leaders on digital divide must be matched by responding to real needs and not exacerbating global inequity. The challenge is to ensure that both the growing worldwide digital divide and initiatives to address it do not compound the existing gap between rich and poor. <p> </p> <p>The internet can and should be harnessed for sustainable development. <a href=\"http://www.OneWorld.net\" target=\"_NEW\">OneWorld.net</a>, the world's largest online community of NGOs, works with hundreds of grassroots groups in poor countries who tackle hardship head on. Many of those working with and on behalf of the poor now use the internet, connecting with individuals and organisations in the west and developing countries to share knowledge and take action on poverty and human rights. New technology, when used appropriately, is a vital new tool to promote global justice and to support programmes that aim to meet the basic needs of the most disadvantaged peoples in our world. </p> <p>Access to the internet is not more important than alleviating hunger or providing access to shelter, healthcare, clean water and education, but it can no longer be separated from these concerns. <br><b>Glen Tarman </b><br> OneWorld<br><a href=\"mailto:media@oneworld.net\">media@oneworld.net</a> </p> <p>\u0095 I was dismayed to see you joining the clamour for \"free\" internet for all (Leader, August 23). What is so special about this electronic medium of information exchange? The argument that we must not tolerate social exclusion holds no water. If it did, why not free travel, post, phones, newspapers, et al? The net represents a staggeringly large capital investment that deserves its entrepreneurial return. The old adage that there is no such thing as a free lunch holds here just as anywhere else - if it is free, is it worth anything? </p> <p> </p> <p>Most net surfing is just that, idle scanning for trivia or titillation. Genuine information searches and business transactions make up a tiny percentage of logged on time. Let those who must, pay. By all means rein in monopoly players such as BT, but if information (or entertainment) has value then it must surely warrant a cost. <br><b>Adrian Bates</b><br>Micheldever, Hants </p>"
