  "<p>Credit Suisse, the Swiss banking group, yesterday set its sights on a new breed of affluent British investors by introducing a pan-European online investment and banking service. The internet-based venture will go live in Britain and Germany next month. </p> <p>The bank also plans to open a number of branches, dubbed \"investment centres\", in Britain. It has set itself a target of signing up 1m customers across Europe over five years. </p> <p>The online service, Global Investor Portfolio, will allow customers to deal in shares on 15 stock markets including London, Frankfurt and New York, and hold their cash in four currencies: sterling, US dollars, Swiss francs and euros. </p> <p>There will also be an \"investment supermarket\" offering products from companies such as Schroder, Merrill Lynch, Mercury Asset Management, HSBC and ABN Amro as well as its own Credit Suisse Asset Management arm. Personal financial advice will be added next year. </p> <p>The service, which will be rolled out across the European Union, puts Credit Suisse in head-to-head competition with HSBC and Merrill Lynch, whose online joint venture targeting affluent investors in Britain goes live later this year. </p> <p>Credit Suisse hopes the idea of having an account with a well-known Swiss bank will attract British investors. It declined to disclose how much it was spending on the venture other than to say it was \"a significant investment\". </p> <p>A spokesman said that, while the service was an online facility with telephone back-up, it would take bricks and mortar form with the opening of hi-tech centres in major areas. It is trialling a centre in Milan. </p> <p>Thomas Wellauer, chief executive of Credit Suisse Financial Services, said the new service was targeting the 40m people identified as \"Europe's 'new affluents' \". </p> <p>\"These are the people who have gained most from the years of economic growth, rising incomes and rising stock markets, but feel the investment services they receive have not improved in line with their new-found affluence.\" </p> <p>These individuals' total invested assets are typically in the region of \u00a330,000-plus. </p> <p>A spokesman said the service was not aiming to be the cheapest and would not be competing with the net's discount brokers, but it is starting with a special offer of a flat fee of \u00a315 per trade. </p> <p>Credit Suisse aims to have more than \u00a320bn under management within five years. It is planned that the service will be available via digital television and Wap mobile phones. </p> <p>Credit Suisse First Boston, the group's investment banking arm, plans a similar online private banking service in the US through its recent acquisition Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette. </p> <p>The move comes amid predictions that the number of online banking and investment accounts in Europe will top 14m by 2004. </p> <p>The number of households in Europe, the Far East, Japan and Latin America which are on the net and contain active investors is expected to grow more than fourfold over the next 10 years to 50m.</p>",
  "<p>The huge growth in postgraduate degrees over the past decade has been accompanied by a shift towards vocational training, with courses and skills now much more focused on the needs of business. But there are increasing concerns that universities are being turned into training grounds for industry. </p> <p>Postgraduate education bears little resemblance to what it was 20 years ago. In that time there has been a 400% rise in student numbers and a radical change in the type of people engaged in postgraduate study, with much more part-time study and mature and overseas students. Major changes are taking place which will alter the postgraduate experience and reshape higher education. </p> <p>Postgraduate numbers have risen as people seek to gain further specific training and differentiate themselves in the job market. This means that postgraduate education now has a much more vocational slant to it. The changes are even impacting on research courses, with research and funding councils increasingly stressing the training elements of postgraduate life. </p> <p>Recent reviews by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) and the Higher Education Funding Council for England (Hefce) both of which have expanded or made explicit reference to training in postgraduate education. It is no longer seen as sufficient for someone to work on a specific piece of research; they must finish with a set of transferrable skills which can be applied not only in an academic context but in any work situation. </p> <p>The student progress files initiative takes this a stage further by introducing greater comparability and consistency into a student's record of achievement. These take the form of individual transcripts which are set to become much more comprehensive. This will enable students and employers to access a more detailed record of achievement which more fully reflects their educational experience. But a more significant part of this initiative for students will be the implementation of personal development plans. These will enable students at all levels to maintain a record of their achievements, goals and experience throughout their courses, and be a major contribution to empowering students in their education. </p> <p>Details of the Progress Files initiative are at <a href=\"http://www.qaa.ac.uk/crntwork/progfileHE/contents.html\">www.qaa.ac.uk/</a> </p> <p>Yet there are worrying aspects to the vocational trends within higher education. Universities are under pressure to make their research, teaching and services more relevant to the broader society and economy. </p> <p>Although this is to be welcomed in principle, many fear that it would be counterproductive to turn universities into mere training grounds for business, industry and the economy. Universities serve a much broader range of functions than this, acting as reserves of knowledge and drivers of initiative, imagination and analysis for society as a whole. </p> <p>Faced with an ever more competitive environment, and persistent funding reductions, the sector is having to fight for its place in society as more than an education factory producing products for consumption by the economy. </p> <p>Proposals from the Conservative party in the past week to free universities by endowing them with funds and removing direct state funding seem to reinforce the idea of universities as no more than servants to the economy. The Conservative proposals say Britain's best universities used to be the best in the world. This is a disingenuous swipe at higher education in Britain as many of us still believe that British universities are the best in the world. Ideas such as these threaten to enhance elitism and reduce opportunity for the population which universities serve as public institutions. </p> <p>For those wishing to pursue an academic career the prospects are often bleak. Salary levels are depressed and for new lecturing staff the pressures to publish and take on extensive teaching responsibilities very quickly are immense. Universities have generally colluded with the funding agencies to push professional development for their new staff back into the years a person takes to complete a PhD. This has meant that current postgraduates are under great pressure to meet ever-increasing demands on their time for training and publishing, while at the same time providing a considerable amount of undergraduate teaching for departments. </p> <p>Students are not products but individuals and if the government's policies of lifelong learning and widening access in higher education are to be more than empty rhetoric, universities must change to be more open and accessible and less elitist in their attitudes. </p> <p> \u0095 Jeremy Hoad is general secretary of the National Postgraduate Committee.</p>",
  "<p>Floating above the clouds of tear gas at last December's Seattle protests, a large white helium balloon carried the most telling and dangerous message of the whole affair. It didn't demand justice for sea turtles or an end to repression in Burma--in fact, it didn't really speak to any of the myriad specific issues raised by the World Trade Organization or its General Agreement on Tariffs and Trades. Instead the slogan was short and simple: \"Wake Up, Muggles.\"</p> <p>Perhaps there is someone reading this who has yet to devour J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter chronicles. If so, a Muggle is someone like-you and I. The people who pay attention to business, watch television, and don't notice that there's a world of wizards and dragons and such right under their noses. Or, in political terms, someone who has accepted the idea that nothing really matters in the world but money. Which is to say, pretty much all of us in the post-Reagan, post-Thatcher years. Remember Bill Clinton's rallying cry: \"It's the economy, stupid.\" Well, the rallying cry of Seattle--and of Washington D.C., site of massive anti-IMF protests in the spring, and of Melbourne, where the World Economic Forum and Bill Gates got a noisy reception this week, and most likely of Prague when the World Bank goes there next week--is that it's not the economy, stupid. It's the environment, it's the right of human beings to live freely, it's the need to pass along the massive wealth of the past decade to more than the few.</p> <p>For a decade or two, we'd gone beyond politics, at least in America. Old liberals had to confess their menu of government programs hadn't done all that they'd promised; young people bought squarely into the idea that taking the fetters off business would benefit us all. Both parties pushed the same basic platform--in fact, one of the ironies of the Clinton administration is that a Republican president would have had a much harder time pushing NAFTA, GATT, and China trade legislation through Congress. All eyes were fixed on the fantastic exploding Dow, which seemed to support the conventional wisdom, and on the wild new communications technologies that seemed to underwrite that prosperity. But prosperity does odd things, including eventually freeing people to think about other topics, from the destruction of rainforests to the melting of the poles. And the net, it turns out, lets young'uns do more than trade Napster files. The TV networks had no idea Seattle was on the way--they were scrambling to parachute crews in for the big battles along Pike Street. But if you'd been visiting the right web sites for the month before, you'd have had a pretty good idea of what was going down.</p> <p> And those web sites, by the way, exist around the world. This analysis is taking hold among dissident thinkers around the Third World. It's true that the elites of developing nations are among the biggest backers of expanded trade--but it's also true, as people are increasingly starting to realize, that those elites don't really represent the people they rule over. The first morning of the WTO protests in Seattle, most of the delegates bumping up against the locked arms of protesters outside the gates were from Africa, Asia, Latin America (the American negotiators had gotten word of what was going on and stayed safely in their hotels). Though they came from wickedly poor countries, they were clearly members of the Gold Card class. You could feel their bewilderment and fear--these were people who had never felt powerless before. Indeed, their hold on power is likely to be more deeply shaken by the year of protests than the power brokers of the First World. The movement, if you can call it that, against the institutions of economic power in the world remains small. It doesn't come close to rivaling the movement against, say, high petrol prices: that's still what really scares the politicians. But what started in Seattle is more prophetic by far. At root it challenges the unspoken idea that all our problems will be solved by growing the economy ever-larger. That's a very hard idea for politicans to co-opt (though Clinton and Blair have certainly been trying, at least rhetorically). It's a fundamental idea, and if the ice caps keep melting, it's a notion that may change the flavour of this century.</p> <p> Bill McKibben is the author of <strong>The End of Nature</strong> and numerous other books on environment and culture.

  "<p>Five months of preparation, press speculation and propaganda and Prague S26 is here. A motley crew of anarchists, socialists, deep ecologists, tree climbers, animal liberators, pacifists, Christians, street reclaimers, politicians, and everything in between, will gather on the cobbled streets of the Czech capital for what promises to be the biggest anti-capitalist protest Europe has ever seen. </p> <p>I am going to Prague because, for me, the blind pursuit of liberalised trade, advocated by the World Bank, the IMF and the WTO, has proven to be more harmful to developing nations than beneficial. Though the institutions aim to alleviate poverty, they have failed badly. The forced imposition of Western financial ideals on states without the economic, social or natural environment to cope with them has led only to increased profits for Western businesses and increased degradation, poverty and death for the poorest people in the developing world.</p> <p>The World Bank and the IMF are profoundly undemocratic. The affluent powers dominate the voting - together wielding enough power to make or break any resolution by themselves. Executives and employees of the Bank and IMF are not elected, their work is not open to public scrutiny, and their policies need no approval by governments. The Bank frequently imposes policies on states against the will of its government and people. I hope peaceful resistance will prevent private deals being struck, deal which might further damage the developing world.</p> <p>The question of revolution versus reform in is one which splits activist and academic alike. The World Bank and the IMF aren't working, but there is room for reform as well as revolution. Structures for distribution of loans are in place, and the bank has plentiful resources that would be wasteful to discard. The biggest overhaul must come in ethos not structure.</p> <p>The abolition of the \"one dollar - one vote\" system is an essential starting point. Only when Zambia has the same voice as the United States, will the World Bank listen to what the developing world is saying about its needs. The Bank must abandon the pursuit of international free trade, instead engaging with grass roots native communities in loan recipient countries to discover what will help them most. The activities of the Bank must become transparent and accountable.</p> <p>There is an immense feeling of frustration among protestors. The Okinawa G8 Summit in July cost Gambia's total debt twice over, but still failed to agree any new commitments to alleviate world poverty. Campaigners feel cheated and ignored, violence is the ultimately unacceptable result. When a hundred or more protesters become violent, they disenfranchise thousands of others who have come to make their point forcefully but peacefully. High ideals of anti-hierarchy and grass roots democracy are sacrificed, media and public sympathy is lost. The activist movement must learn to re-channel their anger. Civil disobedience is more powerful than civil unrest.</p> <p> Gideon Burrows is a journalist and activist. He is news editor of Red Pepper magazine.

  "Treasury ministers are privately considering offering a rebate on diesel duty to road hauliers, but not to the ordinary motorist, to quell the petrol price rebellion which has sent the government into a tailspin. <p>In interviews yesterday the chancellor, Gordon Brown, refused to back down on his hardline stance last week. He insisted he would not give in to short-term demands or return to the era of boom and bust. </p> <p>However, Blairite cabinet ministers are determined to face the Treasury down and insist on a general cut in petrol duties. One said: \"Rebates for road hauliers would only be tinkering at the edges. People feel a genuine grievance over the price of petrol and that needs to be addressed. The chancellor has made his views plain, but so will other ministers.\" </p> <p>The minister said only a big fall in oil prices could prevent the government from making concessions on petrol duties. However, oil prices were continuing to rise last night to more than $34 a barrel. </p> <p>An unexpected go-ahead for a freeze, or even cut, in petrol duties came from the environment minister, Michael Meacher, yesterday. He said the big rise in petrol duties had been environmentally necessary at a time of falling oil prices, but in the past 10 months the price of oil had risen from $10 to $34. He added that improvements in engine technology would be more than twice as effective in cutting carbon emissions than rises in petrol duty. </p> <p>Downing Street is hoping to rebalance the political atmosphere with a string of high profile spending announcements at the Labour conference next week. </p> <p>Mr Brown feels strongly that the rise in petrol duties were necessary to remove the budget deficit and store up the surpluses necessary to fund the big increases in spending on education and health. </p> <p>However, Treasury officials have been in private talks with the Road Haulage Association since the Budget about plans for \"an essential users' rebate\" on petrol duties. </p> <p>The RHA is due to meet the unofficial organisers of last week's \"leaderless protest\" tomorrow to discuss the next moves in their campaign.</p>",
  "<p>Oil prices surged to a 10-year high on the global markets yesterday as tensions in the Middle East and a cautious statement from Saudi Arabia about the chances of further output increases dashed hopes in the west of an early fall in energy costs. </p> <p>Share s fell sharply in New York in response to oil prices rising more than a dollar to just under $37 a barrel.

  "<p>British business must embrace e-commerce more strongly or run the risk of being left behind other leading industrial nations, according to one of the pioneers of India's computer industry. </p> <p>Ashank Desai, chairman of global e-consultancy Mastek, told delegates at the Commonwealth Business Forum: \"A certain complacency and resistance to change in IT advancement have been visible in the attitudes of many of the chief executives in the UK.\" </p> <p>Mastek advises companies as diverse as Lex Vehicle leasing and bookstore Barnes &amp; Noble. </p> <p>Mr Desai claimed that the corporate culture in Britain was not conducive to IT. Technological advancement, he said, is restricted partly because IT managers do not sit on the board of directors of British companies. </p> <p>That often meant firms failed to spot the potential of \"e-opportunities\". </p> <p>Mr Desai, who founded the e-business consultancy in 1982 with two friends in a bedroom in Mumbai, also claimed that there was an \"alarming dearth of skills in Britain\". </p> <p>\"If organisations are not responding properly they will have problems,\" he told the Guardian. \"Whole industries such as financial services and the travel industry are going to change completely the way they do business.\" </p> <p>The warning came as western governments vie to recruit computer programmers from around the globe and especially the Indian subcontinent. Earlier in the year German chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der said he would relax immigration laws to let in highly trained IT staff. </p> <p>Britain is set to follow. Last week Home Office minister Barbara Roche called for a \"debate\" on immigration to plug the skills gap. </p> <p>Mastek, which is now worth almost $500m, has a division in Britain which is run by a \"local chief executive\" but is staffed by Indian programmers. \"We bring people from India for the software development,\" Mr Desai said. </p> <p>A spokesman for Mastek UK said that often the mathematical ability of Indian graduates was far higher than comparable British workers. </p> <p>However, there is hope.

  "<p>\"The most powerful man in Europe\" is how Mario Monti, the European competition commissioner, describes his sparky predecessor, Karel van Miert. And the mild-mannered Italian academic believes this is not time to shrink from the mantle he inherited. </p> <p>Mr Monti is poised to launch a series of sweeping reforms to strengthen the commission's anti-cartel powers, a move that will see him acquire unprecedented authority to conduct investigations. </p> <p>The one-time professor of monetary theory at Bocconi university is also turning his attention to the internet and yesterday served notice that, as one of the world's most powerful regulators, he would be more and more involved in ensuring the sector does not become the preserve of a few mega-corporations such as Microsoft. A \"wait and see approach\" cuts no ice with him and he intends to regulate the sector \"on the basis of what we know now\". </p> <p>Ensuring that no one company controls the internet's infrastructure, be it global backbone networks or more modest local networks, is to be one of his top priorities. The danger, he believes, is that such control can be used to gain an unfair advantage in related markets. </p> <p>Telecoms groups MCI/Worldcom and Sprint, which this year planned the mother of all tie-ups, discovered Mr Monti's views on the subject the hard way. The multi-billion dollar deal spectacularly collapsed after he gave it the thumbs down and yesterday he spelled out why: \"It is a truism to say that the more users there are connected to telecoms networks, the more valuable that network becomes. The corollary of this, however, is that the more important the network becomes, the greater the risk that competition problems will emerge.\" </p> <p>The restricted nature of set-top TV boxes, Microsoft's alleged refusal to dis close vital information about its PC operating systems and online business exchanges are other issues Mr Monti is carefully tracking. </p> <p>In all three cases, he said yesterday, there is a risk that a handful of companies will gain too dominant a position. </p> <p>The quiet Italian has shown he is ready to get tough with the world's mega-corporations. He said no last year to a merger between Airtours and First Choice Holidays and he has blocked a merger between truck makers Volvo and Scania. He is good at getting his own way as Fifa and Uefa have discovered to their cost regarding football transfer rules. </p> <p>Despite his sober demeanour, Mr Monti has a taste for a catchy phrase as befits a former columnist for Corriere della Sera. So he peppers his speeches with talk of \"hardcore cartels\" and \"cancers on the open market economy\" to justify his view that his powers are inadequate. </p> <p>In future, and provided Mr Monti's reforms are approved by EU governments, the EC will work far more closely with national competition authorities and create a powerful network that will allow evidence of cartels to be freely exchanged across borders. Brussels will concentrate on sniffing out the really serious cartels and spend less time looking into small-scale anti-competitive behaviour. </p> <p>Its powers of investigation will also be strengthened. At the moment Mr Monti's investigators only have the power to search companies' premises but in future they will, for the first time, be authorised to search private homes. </p> <p>\"Cartels are cancers on the open market economy, which forms the very basis of our community,\" he said recently. \"Moreover, since by nature cartels are secret and therefore difficult to uncover, it is likely that what we are seeing is only the tip of the iceberg. In the words of Adam Smith there is a tendency for competitors to conspire. I am determined to strengthen our fight against cartels.\" </p> <p>Brussels's powers to levy fines against companies that drag their feet are also set to increase dramatically and Mr Monti is pushing for \"substantial\" fines based on a percentage of annual turnover rather than the current system of relatively small fixed amounts. In short, Mr Monti, who has acquired a reputation for being a tough operator, is just about to get even tougher. </p> <p>He has also announced that he intends to step up cooperation with anti-trust bodies across the world and make \"second generation\" agreements with the United States and others. His team of competition experts in Brussels, which numbers about 80 people and is widely regarded as understaffed, will also be increased. </p> <p>Unsurprisingly, Mr Monti, who is still remembered for killing off duty-free shopping in his last job in charge of the EU's single market, is making few friends among those who fear a more powerful regulator with almost limitless powers.</p>",
  "James Lovelock's argument that nuclear power could save the planet breaks welcome new ground (The whole world in our hands, September 16). Whatever the drawbacks of nuclear power, the issue needs to be discussed. It is the only proven large-scale source of CO2-free power, and there is no certainty that another will be ready in time to mitigate the effects of man-made climate change. <p>The Kyoto protocol programme to reduce emissions by developed countries is under strain, and in any case addresses itself to the optimistic end of forecasts of the speed and severity of global warming. No wonder, given public attitudes to curbing energy use - look at the events of last week. If the other developed countries had followed the French route - 75% nuclear-generated electricity - the numbers would look very different. </p> <p>The environmental movement has savaged the nuclear establishment, sometimes with just cause. The picture would be transformed if the criticism could turn positive, and the environmentalists could get together with the nuclear industry to look for solutions to the problems of nuclear safety and waste disposal, which are not insuperable.

He chooses 2050 as the year by which baking humanity will look back and curse those \"damn\" Greens who prevented a universal nuclear economy from coming into being.

The front-end problems of uranium mining and its wastes, and the tail-end problems posed by the inevitable production of plutonium, would almost certainly be beyond technical and political solution. </p> <p>Moreover, even if Mr Lovelock's nuclear electricity supply scheme should come safely into being, he still offers no answer to the other, greater, need for fuel for agriculture, homes, industry and transport. </p> <p>He should think again, pausing perhaps to consider the case for renewably generated hydrogen, which could answer all our needs, at very little risk and with negligible global warming potential.<br> <b> Mike Koefman</b><br> Manchester  <a href=\"mailto:mike@koefman.u-net.com\">mike@koefman.u-net.com</a></p> <p> \u0095James Lovelock is wrong about radioactive pollution.

  "<p>For those too young to remember, \"protest and survive\" was a slogan that peace campaigners adopted in the 1980s, after the Thatcher government published an absurd pamphlet entitled Protect and Survive advising what to do in a nuclear attack. It was the historian and activist EP Thompson who coined the pun, I seem to remember, for a book of political essays. Protest and Survive is also the title of a new show at London's Whitechapel Gallery about history and its use; the curators say they want to recover \"the political voice that is forever glossed over\" in art from the 1960s to today. </p> <p>Thompson was a romantic British socialist, a student of both Marx and William Morris, who argued in books such as The Making of the English Working Class that popular actions in the past, from bread riots to the poetry of William Blake, can be understood as expressions of a common culture of protest. Thompson was trying to find a common thread in the disparate strands of radicalism; in his day this meant finding a link between CND and the working class. In our day it means finding coherence in the diverse protest movements against the global economy. And in this exhibition it means trying to tie together threads of disparate fury in the art of the past 30 years. </p> <p>So what are they protesting against? What have you got? There's everything here: Gustav Metzger attacking the global economy with his proposal for a monument to the environment composed of rank upon rank of cars, and cartoonist Robert Thompson's flat-capped northerner telling his son as they contemplate smoking factories, \"One day son, all this will be art galleries.\" Then there's 1970s conceptual artist Cosi Fanni Tutti hiring herself out as a model and stripshow dancer in protest against... something, and the Conspiracy Paintings of David MacDermott and Peter MacGough, attacking abstract expressionism as a CIA front and fingering Aids as \"a manipulation of information for purposes of genocide and control, using street drugs and pharmaceuticals to murder and steal property\". </p> <p>This is a raggle-taggle collection of relics, featuring an ill-assorted army of 1970s hippies and skinheads. Whatever it was that made the Austrian artist Valie Export lie motionless in the street in 1972, I'm against it. I'll sign a petition against it. Just don't make me look at any more art relics. There's right-wing protest too, with Gilbert and George's picture of a bomber-jacketed Cocky Patriot (1980) standing between two union flags sewn on the buttocks of a pair of jeans. The homoeroticism complicates the far-right politics - but not enough for my liking. Gilbert and George have become so revered as godfathers of the new British art that young artists and curators now think they can see through their explicit hard right affinities to what they imagine is a core of queer radicalism. But G+G are flamboyantly, unrepentantly right-wing. At a recent public appearance at Tate Modern they confirmed that not only do they still love Margaret Thatcher, \"we even like William Hague\". </p> <p>What is missing from most of this art is analysis. Protest - what does that mean? It can be utterly incoherent and reactionary. \"No Derv for Paediatrician Pervs\", \"We Want Something or Other and We Want it Now!\" as the placards said in Steve Bell's cartoon on the fuel protest in last Thursday's Guardian. Karl Marx pointed out a long time ago that radical romanticism is a waste of time: if you want to change the world, you must first understand it. </p> <p>The best art here attempts to do that. Richard Hamilton's Treatment Room (1984) is an NHS operating theatre with creepy white and military green walls. There's a sink for the professionals to wash their hands after administering treatment. They work at a glass-windowed booth, flicking switches and watching the dials on an electronic control panel. The patient lies on a thin mattress and looks up at a screen with images of Margaret Thatcher speaking. </p> <p>This is a great political work of art because it is witty and does more than protest. Hamilton is an ironist with an acute feeling for history. He loves technology, and even in this study in terror there's a perverse enjoyment. As in his famous collage, Just What Is It That Makes Today's Homes So Different, So Appealing? (1956) - made as a poster for the exhibition This Is Tomorrow at this same gallery almost half a century ago - Hamilton uses an interior as an image of modern life. It is a room that exerts power over anyone who enters it. We are helpless before this historical juggernaut. In the end, we all submit to the treatment. </p> <p>However, while Treatment Room lingers in the mind, much of the art here doesn't. The style of the exhibition is deliberately anti-aesthetic. In a reaction against glitzy contemporary art shows, this one sets out to make you think. So you have to read a lot of words. The conceptual artist Steven Willats's contributions - early 1980s text and archive pieces in which witnesses describe post-punk subcultures - are mostly words. Only when you get to the end of his texts do you realise they weren't worth reading. Jo Spence's remodellings of photo history and medical history were also done largely in words. This is in the tradition of conceptual art, which was born in the late 1960s out of a suspicion of the image: artists who wanted to attack capitalism believed words were more honest than pictures. They thought they were continuing the Dadaist anti-art tradition, but the Dadaists discovered that images could be a form of political power: some of the most powerful images of the 20th century are German Dadaist John Heartfield's anti-Nazi photomontages. I wanted something like that here, something to bite into memory. </p> <p>Protest and Survive identifies politics in contemporary art with a suspicion of the aesthetic. This reflects the mood of young art in London. Artists and curators emerging in the wake of the Hirst generation are wary of making shiny, visually striking things to go in galleries. They see themselves as infinitely more serious. Politics is suddenly a word to conjure with. Artists want to be conceptual Marxists, like the 1970s group Art&amp;Language. </p> <p>But art is a symbolic practice. Artists create images, and images have political meanings - ones the artist might not predict. The most potent political works of the past few decades - like the great political art of the past from Goya to Guernica - deploy devastating images. This show could have included Andy Warhol's electric chairs, Ed Keinholz's Portable War Memorial, Chris Burden's Shoot, Joseph Beuys' Tramstop. </p> <p>Instead we get art whose sense of its own impotence cannot be concealed. Giorgio Sadotti's installation One...Two... (1993), consisting of a set of drums, guitars and amplifiers apparently just left by a band rehearsing in a garage, is melancholic. The catalogue links it to anarcho-skinhead writer Stewart Home's definition of revolution as \"one, two, three, four\" and it seems intended as an image of action. But it doesn't feel like that: it feels feeble, leftover, marginal. On the wall nearby is a painting by art collective Bank of a dismal factory landscape modelled on LS Lowry. \"Would you be worried if one of these northerners ceased to exist?\" asks a poster with the same Lowry stick figures. This is a pretty good joke. But it smacks of what political activists used to call defeatism. </p> <p>I think we are approaching the core of the exhibition's oddness. One of the curators is Matthew Higgs, founder at the age of 14 of a fanzine for Joy Division, a band not noted for their revolutionary optimism. The other is Paul Noble, inventor of Nobson Newtown, a scary imaginary town whose Nobslums and Nobjobclub he draws with meticulous despair. What a pair of miseries. This exhibition claims to revive the art of protest, but it is really an act of mourning. The problem with all the disjointed protests it brings together is that you never feel they are tangible or present. They happened; we pore over the relics. </p> <p>The curators should have read their EP Thompson. For Thompson there is no future without art. Culture is not the enemy; it is what we need to give us common purpose and strength. Symbols, narratives and argument are the resources Thompson believed were necessary if we were to protest and survive. This exhibition distrusts symbols, repudiates narrative. It contrasts unfavourably with the exhibition that beat all these new political art shows to it and did it better - Unconvention, curated by the artist Jeremy Deller last year at Cardiff's Centre for the Visual Arts (which, incidentally, has just been closed down by Cardiff's city council). </p> <p>Unconvention had an infectious enthusiasm to it, and a belief in art, culture and the human spirit, whether expressed in pop music, Jackson Pollock (both were in the show), or activism. It made you hopeful. Deller's contribution to Protest and Survive is funny and poignant, too: he shows a series of snapshots of Bozo the Clown, a middle-aged man in full clown makeup, wandering round the futuristic exhibits at Hanover's Expo 2000. The piece is called Has the World Changed, or Have I Changed? </p> <p>However, the real star of Protest and Survive is the Turner-shortlisted photographer Wolfgang Tillmans, who saves the show which he publicised as guest editor of the Big Issue. At the far end of the highest gallery at the Whitechapel he is given a long wall to create one of his free, collagistic installations of his own pictures mixed up with news headlines, magazine pictures and other stuff. Tillmans is anything but a conceptual artist. He's relaxed with making images, seeming to chance on them without thinking. And yet his montage of momentary glimpses of things, from rock festival crowds to an operating theatre to young soldiers, adds up to an image of living today, trying to protest and survive. It's poetic rather than rational, and all the better for it. At the centre of Tillmans's installation is a huge blown-up colour image of a sandcastle whose foundations are being lapped by the sea. A beautiful green wave flows towards the already tottering turrets. It makes you think of walls crashing down. </p> <p>\u0095 Protest and Survive is at the Whitechapel Art Gallery, London E1 (020-7522 7878), till November 12.</p>",
  "<p>The Aurora Borealis, commonly known as the northern lights, is one of the natural world's most spectacular phenomena, featuring large areas of flashing colours, in the direction due north. For a weak aurora, the colour will be very faint and spread out, and may be hard to see. If the aurora intensifies, it may move higher in the sky and develop into a more distinct arc. Brighter patches can develop which turn into ribbons of light which dart around the sky. They are a common sight in the night skies of the far north. At times of intense solar activity, they become visible from lower latitudes. The 11-year solar cycle is now at its peak and the aurora may be visible from Britain from now until well into the next year. </p> <p><strong> Viewing</strong><br> </p> <p> The northern lights can be tricky to see in this country, as an individual display may only last for a few minutes, though it may be repeated many times during the course of the night. The best time for viewing is between 10pm and 2am on a cloudless night when the sky is at its darkest. The York University magnetospheric physics group, led by Dr Ian Mann, which monitors activity in space, has just launched a website <a href=\"http://www.aurorawatch.york.ac.uk\"> www.aurorawatch.york.ac.uk</a> to help people understand and see the phenomenon. Predicting exactly when a display will take place is not easy, but those who register at the website will receive an automatic email aurora alert that can be forwarded as text messages to mobile phones. </p> <p><strong> Climate change</strong><br> </p> <p> Whilst rises in greenhouses gases have made a significant contribution to global warming, many scientists, such as Dr Mann, are now interested in the possible effects of the solar cycle on the Earth's climate, as there is increasing evidence that the 11-year cycle of solar activity can have significant effects on terrestrial weather. </p> <p>Between the years of 1645 and 1715, sun spots disappeared almost entirely from the solar surface. During this time the earth experienced a mini-ice age. The global temperature fell considerably, and famously the Thames in London froze over. Through the solar cycle, the amount of light emitted by the sun only changes by around two or three tenths of one per cent. Scientists do not believe that this can account for the observed solar cycle climate changes. However, the changes in the ultraviolet radiation emitted by the sun are much larger. This radiation is absorbed in the Earth's upper atmosphere, changes the levels of ozone concentration, and alters atmospheric temperatures. These changes affect the strengths of atmospheric winds, and this may be felt in changes to the weather on the ground. Future research may reveal that the sun affects the climate more than we thought.</p>",
  "<p>Last November, at a time when the Buenos Aires spring was turning into summer and the jacaranda trees were in full lilac bloom, I had the good fortune to be paid to go there. My job was to take photographs for a book celebrating the 120th anniversary of a Jewish educational charity called ORT which, despite few people having heard of it, is the largest non-governmental training organisation in the world. </p> <p>Today it operates in more than 60 countries with 280,000 students - a far cry from humble origins in the tsarist St Petersburg of 1880. </p> <p>The Russian financier, Baron de Gunzburg, decided to help alleviate the poverty that the country's anti-semitic laws had forced millions of his fellow Jews into. With other leading members of the community, he raised money to set up a number of vocational schools where impoverished Jews could learn the trades that would help them survive. ORT - or the Organisation for the Distribution of Artisanal and Agricultural Skills among Jews - was born, and before long it became an indispensable component of Jewish life in Russia. By the early 20th century it was operating in eastern Europe too. </p> <p>The 1917 revolution drove fundraising outside the new communist state. Yet ORT continued to provide training to Jews in the Soviet Union until Stalin's purges of 1937 led to it closing its Russian operations for the next 50 odd years. Elsewhere in Europe it carried on in an increasingly dangerous climate. Wherever Jews met with discrimination, the organisation provided them with the means to fend for themselves. Somehow it operated in Berlin right up until the 1940s and remarkably carried on running courses in ghettos and camps in Nazi-occupied territory even as the Holocaust was in full swing. </p> <p>As European Jews fled to places as far as Shanghai and Santiago, ORT followed, setting up centres where refugees could learn skills that would allow them to earn a living. By the end of the second world war the organisation had become global, shadowing the diaspora to the New World and, of course, to the new state of Israel. </p> <p>Argentina was just my first stop, before Uruguay, America, France, Russia and Israel, now the main focus of ORTs attentions, with 80,000 students in 140 schools, universities and technical colleges. But it does not just look after its own. In Jaffa I photographed Jewish and Arab pupils learning side by side. In the mountains of northern Israel I visited an ORT-funded school in a Druze village. </p> <p>And for the last 40 years ORT has been active in the developing world, setting up self-sustaining vocational training programmes. It is a mark of the esteem in which the organisation is held that states as diverse as Bhutan and Bahrain, Bangladesh and Bolivia have all asked it to provide them with technical assistance. More recently it has taken an active part in helping Kosovo and Bosnia get back on the road to normality by establishing education programmes. </p> <p>As I tripped around the world, I don't think I've ever seen so much technological hardware. From a charity to help a persecuted people simply survive, it has turned into a sophisticated organisation leading the way in preparing people for the hi-tech revolution. </p> <p>Then there is the sheer scale of it. Moving from country to country, I was overwhelmed by the diversity of this colossus, whose annual budget runs to some $250m. In that one month, I photographed - to name but a few - media studies students in Buenos Aires, trainee aircraft mechanics in Tel Aviv and prospective fashion designers in Moscow. ORT returned to Russia in 1995 and has a technology centre in St Petersburg. </p> <p>It was the mood that stuck most in my mind: a genuine spirit of collaboration. Most teachers and students I met were no longer bound by the master-pupil relationship of my school days, but were more like partners in a project to ensure future generations' success. The St Petersburg founders would be proud to see just how well their pragmatic philosophy of training people for life has paid off. </p> <p> \u0095 Facing the Future, 120 Years of ORT (\u00a315.99) from ORT House, 126 Albert Street, London NW1 7NE.

  "<p>It is day one of your university induction course. Take the rifle and learn how to protect yourself against being killed by the local wildlife. In the field the student will need to put tripwires round the tent to set off thunderflashes in case of night attack, and learn how to pack a sledge and signal down a helicopter. </p> <p>Riding a bike from digs to lecture hall with a \u00a3500 university issue hunting rifle slung over your shoulder is routine for students enrolling at the most northerly campus on the planet. It is an outpost of Norway in the high Arctic properly known as Svalbard but better known to most Brits as Spitsbergen. Next to the hooks for coats is a gun rack. </p> <p>This centre of scientific excellence is closer to the pole than the edge of the Arctic Circle and takes protecting its students very seriously. It is only three years ago that a female student, walking unarmed less than a mile from the centre of the campus, was killed and half eaten by a polar bear. Her companion, another woman student, jumped over a cliff to avoid the same fate and survived, at the cost of two broken legs. </p> <p>Longyearbyen, the capital of Svalbard, has other claims to fame apart from being 78 degrees north, the haunt of polar bears and the only campus in Europe where the students are routinely armed by the university authorities. There are also local rules about security. No one locks their front door so everyone has a chance to escape into the nearest house if a polar bear is passing. </p> <p>It has probably the best ratio of professors to students on the planet and an extraordinary list of visiting lecturers in the specialist subjects of Arctic biology, geology, geophysics and technology. Spitsbergen, and the neighbouring islands that make up Svalbard, are dotted with international establishments at the frontiers of space technology, research into climate change and such projects as mapping precisely how fast continents are moving together or apart. </p> <p>Lasse Loennum, director of UNIS (University Courses on Svalbard) regrets one omission from his extraordinary line-up - British students. Although in 1999 there were 234 students from 22 countries and all of the lectures were in English, not a single UK student was enrolled. \"I like British students because their basic maths and physics is so good, but getting them here is very difficult.\" </p> <p>UNIS is jointly owned by the four Norwegian Universities and the first students were accepted in 1993 as an integrated part of the Norwegian system. There are no tuition fees and 35 courses are offered for undergraduates with about 50 M.Sc and Ph.D students. This year there are 14 professors on campus, 10 adjunct professors (visitors from other universities) and 170 guest lecturers. Most of the students come from Scandinavia, with half from Norway, but France, Italy and the US also send undergraduates. </p> <p>Although the campus is only 600 miles from the pole it is one of the warmest places in the Arctic because Svalbard's shores are washed by the most northerly extremity of the Gulf Stream. It is only 20 degrees below centrigrade in winter compared with 40 degrees in Canada much further south. In winter, when it is dark for three months, students are treated to almost daily displays of the northern lights because Svalbard is on the cleft of the magnetic field of the earth. </p> <p> This makes the nearby mountain an ideal study centre and the home of the two giant dishes which are the eyes and ears of European Incoherent Scatter Radar project which studies the effect of the sun on the earth's magnetic field. </p> <p> In summer the weather can be warm enough to sunbathe and temperatures can reach 20 degrees C during the four months without a sunset. </p> <p>Mr Loennum says that while Svalbard is a mecca for winter sports and wildlife enthusiasts, and students spend part of the year getting around on snowmobiles, the university is not an excuse for a \"tourist semester\". </p> <p>\"This is the smallest university in the world with the largest laboratory, this marvellous almost untouched stretch of the Arctic to study. We study things like permafrost, glaciers, global pollution and how it affects the Arctic and marine biology. The staff-student ratio is unrivalled so we expect people to take full advantage of the opportunity. We want people to be serious.\" </p> <p>UNIS has links with the University of Southampton, University of Wales in Cardiff and Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in Oxfordshire but so far only at a post-graduate and teaching level. </p> <p>So far there are no undergraduates but Mr Leonnum hopes that word will filter back. \"We are hoping for a British contingent to complete our international flavour. After all, as all the lectures are in English, it seems a shame not to take advantage.\" </p> <p>The 35 courses on offer this year are up to one year's duration as part of biology, geology, geophysics or technology degrees. The university year lasts from August to June with the spring semester January to mid-June. </p> <p> See: <a href=\"http://www.unis.no\">www.unis.no</a></p>",
  "<p>Christopher Fletcher was amazed when he came down to breakfast one morning to find his 14-year-old son Mark in floods of tears, begging not to be sent to school that day. His amazement turned to shock and rage when he found out that some of his son's classmates had set up a web page devoted to Mark. Posted on the site was a variety of abuse and taunts. It had already been seen not only by the pupils in Mark's class, some of whom had accessed it via the computers at their school, but by other children in the area, one of whom had phoned to alert Mark. </p> <p>Christopher already knew that there had been problems in Mark's class and that boys had been picking on each other throughout the year; but he had thought that the situation had been resolved. He was horrified to find that the extremely public humiliation via techno-bullying was the culmination of a sustained campaign directed against his son. </p> <p>\"The internet may be a wonderful thing, but this was just evil; it wasn't a game, it wasn't schoolboy banter, it was a very nasty, public, personal attack,\" he says. \"The page said he was fat, gay, had no friends - and plenty more like that. The site had been accessed via the school computers during the lunch-hours, it had been seen by most of his class, by his peer group, and he was extremely upset.\" </p> <p>The site has been taken down now, as far as Christopher knows; but the damage has been done. \"It's very worrying, because there's no control at all over what goes up on the web.\" </p> <p>It is the first case of this particular kind of techno-bullying that Hereward Harrison, director of policy at Childline, has come across; but, sadly, he's not surprised. \"Young people are very inventive,\" he says. \"We have heard of instances of using text messages on mobile phones to bully other children. The technology for this kind of behaviour is there now, and bullies are turning it to their own ends.\" </p> <p>Similarly, Susan Littlemore, communications director at Parentline Plus, a charity that runs a free help and information service on all aspects of parenting, is concerned but hardly amazed at the emergence of techno-bullying. \"Kids are very ingenious in the ways that they bully each other. Technology is moving on and children today are extremely computer-literate; I should think that any technological framework that's set up to stop children saying horrible things online will quickly be circumvented.\" </p> <p>So what can be done to help children who find themselves in a similar situation to Mark Fletcher? Hereward Harrison says that dealing with techno-bullying starts with gathering evidence and getting adult help. The first step he recommends is to keep a detailed diary of what's happening, including any abusive emails or downloaded web pages, and show it to a parent or teacher. \"Making the situation public is very positive when it comes to bullying. Then you need to set up a meeting between parents, school and the young person themselves, and formulate a plan of action; if necessary go to school governors, or the local education authority. In some cases the intervention of the police has been very effective.\" </p> <p>But when Christopher Fletcher approached his son's school, he found that getting help was not easy. \"They first said that because the site hadn't been concocted on school equipment, it was nothing to do with them. When I pointed out that it had been accessed from school computers, they were more interested. I had a letter from the head saying he had spoken to the boys concerned, but the overall tone was one of 'boys will be boys'. \" </p> <p>Fletcher was sufficiently incensed by this cavalier approach to seek legal advice. \"What the school took some time to appreciate was that Mark has been libelled. It's like putting up a sign on a roundabout that everyone can read. We're entitled to sue for libel on his behalf. I am going to tell the school that if it happens again, we will be suing - taking out injunctions against the parents of the boys concerned, impounding their home computers, and, if school computers were used, impounding those too.\" </p> <p>Christopher Fletcher may not be so far off the mark in thinking about the legal implications of techno-bullying. In April of this year, a professor at the City College in San Francisco launched a libel lawsuit over allegations made by students on a website that he is \" racist and mentally ill\". Daniel Curzon Brown describes the site as \"evil\" and claims that the attacks had made him \"depressed and afraid\". He is currently suing the company that runs the website. </p> <p>According to Susan Littlemore, schools don't always do all they can to help bullied children in more conventional situations, let alone ones aggravated by the use of technology. She says that many parents are let down by teachers, even when their child has been bullied to the end of his or her tether. \"Parents are often surprised by how long their child has managed to conceal the issue, and when the parents find out, it's often an extreme situation by then. Not only is the child disturbed, but the parents are extremely distressed.\" </p> <p> When it comes to techno-bullying, says Littlemore, \"the argument isn't about creating a sterile environment where abuses can't happen, because that's probably impossible\". The way forward, she says, is for schools to set up an anti-bullying policy. \"We are finding this isn't happening. Parents with legitimate concerns who approach their child's school aren't being heard. Getting parents involved is essential. It's easy for those who are delivering education to focus solely on education, which is why parents need to become involved and voice their concerns.\" </p> <p>Teachers, however, would argue that they are beleaguered enough already without adding to their workload. \"It's impossible for teachers to police what's happening outside school - it's difficult enough inside,\" says a spokeswoman for the National Union of Teachers. \"If the teachers are aware of bullying, they can do something about it, but bullied children are often very secretive. Teachers can't see what children are doing on their computers at home; they can't monitor pupils' private lives. That is where parents come in.\" </p> <p>She recommends keeping home computers in shared spaces. \"If the computer is in the living room then you can see on a regular basis as you pass by what your child is doing.\" The computer shouldn't be hidden away in the child's bedroom, she says. \"If the parents of the children involved in this particular case had known what their children were doing, they might have been able to put a stop to it. Parents must monitor home use.\" </p> <p>Littlemore isn't so sure. \"Whenever a community is set up, that community has responsibilities. Schools need to take that on board. When schools say they don't know what to do about bullying or it's not up to them to deal with it, the parents are stuck in the middle - it's very unpleasant.\" </p> <p> \u0095 Next month Parentline Plus is launching an anti-bullying initiative for parents; for more information call their free helpline on 0808 800 2222 (textline 0800 783 6783) or visit <a href=\"http://www.parentlineplus.org.uk\">www.parentlineplus.org.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>\"I haven't not enjoyed anything at the school, only that I wish school could end later than 3.15pm because I really enjoy learning about things and I also get to be with my friends.\" This is a year six pupil, aged 10, talking about life at West Kidlington Primary School in Oxfordshire. Another year six child suggested that a way of improving the school would be to make playtime shorter and spend more time in class. </p> <p>The reason for this surprising enthusiasm is a programme implemented by Neil Hawkes, headteacher at Kidlington for seven years and now senior education adviser with Oxfordshire County Council. His \"values education\" policy goes way beyond the three Rs. Each month, the school concentrates on a particular value, which could be honesty, respect, tolerance or happiness. The theme is taken up in every classroom lesson: did Henry VIII respect his wives? Subjects that aren't an obvious forum are pulled in as well: an arts class focusing on caring gave the children the task of drawing their hands, but alongside the sketching they were asked to think about what their hands could be used for, and before they put pencil to paper there was a lively discussion on the whole issue. </p> <p>Young children are introduced early to the idea of abstract concepts and, most importantly, trying to understand how others tick (What makes you happy? What makes other people happy?). A year five child, aged nine, who had been studying the concept of simplicity, said: \"Simplicity is beautiful. It means staying in the present, economy, using resources wisely, not wasting things, not being careless, giving time to your friends.\" A response that wouldn't shame someone twice his age. </p> <p>The themes are also addressed in the playground, the dinner hall and the staff room. For example, a child is not told off in public. If there is a problem, they are taken aside, which shows respect from the teacher. In general, the principle is practising what one preaches rather than a \"do as I say, not as I do\" credo. At dinner time, a teacher will show what is expected by praising a quiet group rather than criticising a noisy one - the over-excited children calm down as if by magic. The emphasis, says Hawkes, is as much on implicit teaching as explicit teaching. </p> <p>The core of the values system came from the experience of a long and varied teaching career, including stints as headteacher and school inspector. \"I kept on looking at the society round me and I thought something should be happening in our schools to make everything more civilised,\" says Hawkes. \"I'm very disturbed by violence and anti-social behaviour and I wanted to see if a school could effect a qualitative change in pupils by thinking about values.\" These values could equally be called virtues or principles, he says: they are basically the tenets that guide civilised behaviour, the fundamental building blocks of cultures and societies worldwide. </p> <p>The success of the pilot scheme at West Kidlington is not, Hawkes insists, based on any kind of fluffy notion of \"Let's all just be nice to each other\". \"It's not a cuddly-cuddly soft approach,\" he says. \"It's highly disciplined and extremely focused. It makes great demands on the staff, who have to be very consistent, and they have been splendid and backed me 100%.\" This is reflected in the school's academic results: although 30% of the pupils have educational difficulties, in the latest round of SATs over 90% of pupils at key stage 2 (ages seven to 11) achieved level four or above. Attendance has improved, too; days off during term through illness are \"negligible\", says Hawkes. </p> <p>Other advantages are less quantifiable; pupils, parents and visitors talk about a \"special\" atmosphere. Ellen Gardner, whose four children all attend the school, particularly enjoys the assemblies - a key part of the values scheme, says Hawkes. \"It's amazing how they get that many kids in that hall and they're so quiet,\" says Gardner. \"I notice that no one drags their feet when they're walking in, they stand nice and straight, their heads high. No one slouches. I love their singing. It's a different way of silence the children have there - they do their silence out of respect.\" </p> <p>Though the notion of this kind of holistic teaching may seem very modern, it is, says Hawkes, based on one classic fundamental: high-quality teaching. \"Values can sound vague and wishy-washy, but it's all about good teaching. I'm old-fashioned; I don't believe in the second-rate. We need to create an environment where children will be encouraged to achieve their best, and it comes down to what you think is important. Literacy is important, but so is being honest, caring, happy and having a sense of humour.\" </p> <p>He is also a realist. \"It takes a lot of hard work. People don't suddenly become angels by using these methods. But it does let children think, reflect, work out the principles by which they are going to live their lives.\" Critics, he says, can try to suggest that the school should stick to the three Rs and butt out of trying to instil values. \"People who don't know the effects of what we do at first hand can think that. But no one in our own community has ever detracted from what we do.\" </p> <p>Hawkes is now concentrating on spreading these principles to other schools. At Kidlington, the current head, staff, parents and pupils continue to apply value-based teaching with great success. \"More than anything else, the children are taught how to be nice people. They're taught respect for one another. That's rare these days,\" says one parent. </p> <p> \u0095 A Quiet Revolution: Encouraging positive values in our children, by Frances Farrer and Neil Hawkes, is published by Rider at \u00a39.99.</p>"
