  "Charles Kennedy does not need to read too many assessments of his first year as leader of the Liberal Democrats: he has already made one of his own. By his own admission, he has had a \"slow-burn start\" in the job - and there are few who would disagree. He has not enjoyed anything like the profile of his predecessor, but that is hardly a fair measure. Paddy Ashdown had 20 years to make his mark, Mr Kennedy has had just 12 months. But has he used that time wisely? <p>At the top of any credit column must be the triumph of Romsey. The Lib Dems stole the seat from the Tories in a May by-election, an achievement of great audacity coming three years after the landslide Tory defeat of 1997. Losing by-elections is what happens to governments; it is not meant to happen to oppositions. It was very much Mr Kennedy's victory. He campaigned in the constituency himself, daring to go mano a mano with William Hague on the live local issue of asylum. His defence of a truly liberal position on that question was bold, and paid off. </p> <p>Mr Kennedy has also given his party a measure of clarity, concentrating his fire on three specific areas. He wants to position the Lib Dems as the party of moderate libertarianism, increased spending on public services and concern for the environment. To that end, he made his debut policy pronouncement on the decriminalisation of cannabis, followed by regular demands for Labour to spend more, coupled with lots of warm, green noises. The advantage of this approach is that it understands the limited attention span of the electorate: just getting the Lib Dems on to the national radar screen is achievement enough - transmitting more than three messages at once would clutter the airwaves. </p> <p>There are two further, rather less obvious accomplishments. Under Mr Kennedy's leadership, the Lib-Lab joint cabinet committee has met only twice. That may look like a failure for \"the project,\" but it could play well for Mr Kennedy. First, it will win over those Lib Dems who feared the new leader would be a poodle for Tony Blair. Second, it might reassure those wavering Tory voters who will come over to the Lib Dems so long as the party does not behave like a government subsidiary. </p> <p>In the same vein, Mr Kennedy can make a virtue of Labour's recent failure at its policy forum to back Roy Jenkins's plan for voting reform. Officially, Lib Dems should be disappointed, for Labour has opted instead for a model which appears no more proportional than the current system. But Mr Kennedy can tell his party that Labour's policy is at least a step away from first past the post - and that Britain's historic paralysis on electoral reform is at last being broken. </p> <p>That much the leader can be happy with. But he should not let himself off too easily. His performances in the House of Commons have been pretty dire; he has seemed faint and nervous. He may regard prime minister's questions as \"street theatre\", but his weakness on that stage matters - if only for the effect it has on his own troops. More generally, he has failed to impress. Even on television, his favourite arena, he resorts too often to political cliche and the pat answer. It is good that he is about to publish a book (though the title, The Future of Politics, is another cliche), for he really does need to gain some philosophical heft. </p> <p>One year on, Mr Kennedy needs to work out a strategy beyond assuming that the anti-Tory hatred of 1997 will carry him through next time round. He is a man of talents, but he has to work them much harder.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.phone.com\">Phone.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.software.com\">Software.com</a>, two internet software companies, announced a merger worth at least $6.8bn (\u00a34.5bn) yesterday in a deal which underlines the fast-growing nature of so-called wireless access to the internet. </p> <p>Share prices in both companies increased sharply following the announcement of the merger, bringing the total value of the all-share transaction closer to $8bn by noon in New York. </p> <p>Wall Street analysts said that the deal could make it easier to access the same communication service such as email from conventional land lines and mobile telephones. </p> <p>Phone.com, which provides software and applications for wireless telephones, was instrumental in the adoption of the wireless application protocol - or WAP - standard, while Software.com has focused on providing communications services such as email and instant messaging for use on computers. </p> <p>One analyst who declined to be named described the combination as a \"wake-up call for Microsoft\" because the world's largest software company still cannot provide a \"carrier class\" mobile service. </p> <p>Simon Buckingham, an analyst at Mobile Lifestreams, a research company, said the deal guaranteed Phone.com's long-term future by adding a solid technology platform to its wireless base. </p> <p>The California-based companies list British Telecommunications, Sprint, Telecom Italia Mobile and AT&amp;T among their clients. </p> <p>With little overlap, the companies hope they can cross-sell their products. </p> <p>Donald Listwin is to leave US-based Cisco Systems, the world's largest internet infrastructure equipment supplier, to become chief executive of the combined group. </p> <p>Yesterday he said the merger would create a \"global software company\" with a powerful position among communication service providers. </p> <p>Alain Rossman, Phone.com's current chief executive, is to become chairman of the merged group. </p> <p>Under the terms of the deal, shareholders in Software.com are to receive 1.6 shares in Phone.com, valuing their stake at $125 a share, based on Tuesday's closing price. </p> <p>After Phone.com's share price rose almost 20% yesterday the shares were valued at more than $146. Shares in Software.com rose 33% on the news to $147. </p> <p>The stock market performance of both companies since they launched at less than $30 a share 14 months ago shows that investors are still relatively bullish on the \"internet infrastructure\" - or simply network - sector. </p> <p>However, even after yesterday's share price increase both are trading below the highs of $208 and $155 reached in March before the market-wide sell-off in technology shares. </p> <p>Once completed, shareholders of each group are to own about 50% of the newly combined company. </p> <p>The group is to confirm a new name once shareholders have given their consent to the planned merger. </p> <p>Phone.com has between 200 and 300 sales staff in the US; no job cuts are anticipated as a result of the deal.</p>",
  "<p>Nasser Hussain will today seek to regain his batting form in the manner of England captains for the past century or more, in the restful environment of the county championship - in his case at Kidderminster, where Essex are playing Worcestershire. </p> <p>But for Mike Atherton and Marcus Trescothick, the other two batsmen required in England's second innings at Old Trafford on Monday, the post-Test cricket will take a very different form: floodlit National League matches, with all the surrounding razzmatazz, in Atherton's case at Headingley and for Trescothick at Bristol. </p> <p>Yorkshire and Gloucestershire, who are hosting fixtures with regional significance against Lancashire and Somerset respectively, are hoping for five-figure crowds. Whatever happens, they are each guaranteed to attract more paying spectators than today's six first-class matches, including Hussain's trip to Kidderminster and the West Indies' latest tour fixture at Derby, can muster in total. </p> <p>As Dave Gilbert, the Australian general manager of Sussex, the only county to have so far installed permanent floodlights, says: \"Day-night cricket is here to stay because people are voting with their feet. Floodlit cricket has definitely gone against the national trend which has been decreasing attendances.\" </p> <p>Gilbert argues that the new, nocturnal form of the game is succeeding despite, rather than because of, the England and Wales Cricket Board. He points to the chaotic nature of the fixture list, with floodlit matches popping up on all days of the week, and the inadequacy of the temporary lights that are used at all grounds other than Hove. </p> <p>A worrying number of the day-night matches have been won comfortably by the team batting first, leading to suspicions that the lights that the ECB hires and part-funds are not strong enough. \"I went to Edgbaston for the one-day international between England and Zimbabwe and I was quite shocked at how murky the light was at 10 o'clock,\" said Gilbert. \"For international cricket it's not good enough.\" </p> <p>These are charges that Terry Blake, the ECB's marketing director, takes on board. \"Alec Stewart was also critical after that Edgbaston game and yes, it's important that we've got good lights, but we have very good people putting in the temporary lights and it's not for the want of funding,\" he said. \"The next step is permanent lights, but permanent lights of the substantial variety is a serious expenditure. </p> <p>\"With regard to the fixtures, I think chaotic is a strong word because the fixture system is incredibly complicated to work out. We are trying to fit a quart into a pint pot. </p> <p>\"I suppose in an ideal world you would say that we ought to have a floodlit festival in a more condensed period of time. It's a bit chilly in April and May, and maybe June is a bit ambitious because of the beginning of the international programme. So maybe July and August would be the time to concentrate on floodlit cricket, that's one way of looking at it. </p> <p>\"We are about halfway through an experimental phase. At the end of next season we will be having a review to see where floodlit cricket should fit into the domestic structure after 2002, when our current television deal expires.\" </p> <p>Gilbert has some strong recommendations. \"We want Friday nights,\" he said. \"Then you get the best of both worlds, the corporate and also the kids because there's no school the next day. </p> <p>\"But unfortunately the way the fixture schedules are for the next couple of years, Championship cricket has to be Wednesday to Saturday. If the ECB are going to support floodlit cricket, they have to support it in terms of the evenings to hold it.\" </p> <p>Where Gilbert and Blake do agree is on floodlit cricket's importance to the future of the English game at county and international level. \"We have been doing a lot of exit research at floodlit matches and one-day internationals, and the statistics from last year suggested that we are getting to a new age group of 16 to 34, and more women, and more first-time users, and that's very important,\" said Blake. </p> <p>\"Floodlit cricket was certainly a brave new world and unfortunately there's still the doubting Thomases out there who want to see it fail,\" added Gilbert. \"But it's not going to fail because you're putting cricket on when people can watch it, both at the ground and on TV. </p> <p>\"Cricket as a sport just can't keep relying on this is what we used to do. So many other sports have moved massively ahead in the way they promote and market themselves. And if cricket wants to keep saying this is the way we've always done it, well, you're going to get trodden on.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong> Load of hot air</strong><br> The issue of cows and the production of methane - long known to be a cause of global warming - is the object of much research to try to find out how to stop them doing it. Contrary to popular belief, as Reading University puts it, all ruminant methane is released through the mouth (not the other end, as with termites) because it is part of the forestomach digestive system. Ruminants are responsible for about one-fifth of the world's methane production; with 2.3m dairy cows in the UK, that is 230,000 tonnes of methane a year, not to mention the efforts of beef cattle and sheep. The disappointment is that experiments giving cows cough lozenges appeared to work but the quantity involved proved alarmingly large. Now a bacteria - a bit like the stuff in yoghurt - has been developed. It works, but no one has yet thought of a way of getting farmers to feed it to cows - after all it only helps the environment and not the bottom line. Reading is seriously suggesting a methane tax. Honestly.</p> <p><strong> Of mice and GM</strong><br> New figures from the Home Office on GM animal experiments due out next week show a growth industry. The total number of experiments in 1999 on animals of all sorts - mostly rats and mice - stands at 2.26m and did not rise overall, but the number on GM animals rose by 63,000 to 511,000. No word yet on what scientists are trying to achieve with GM rodents.</p> <p><strong> That guilty felling</strong><br> Cause at last to thank Jack Cunningham, MP for Copeland. The embarrassment the government felt when Friends of the Earth revealed his new desk in the Cabinet Office and panelling for warships were made of illegally logged tropical timber caused a government rethink on the issue. Michael Meacher, the environment minister, announced that government departments will only buy timber from legal, sustainable resources. Let us hope they enforce the order.</p> <p><strong> It's good to talk</strong><br> DTI minister Helen Liddell's Commons answer about BNFL's decision to take back nuclear fuel from Japan contained the following sentence: \"The government's support for BNFL's decision followed full consultation across departments.\" Ten days later, on exactly the same subject, Michael Meacher said in another answer: \"There was no consultation between ministers or officials from my department and the Department of Trade and Industry...\" Oops.</p>",
  "<p>The wheat growing in the field known as the Horse Ground is now tall, golden and ready to be harvested. With Cotswold cream houses as a backdrop, it is a scene any visitor would relish. But the farming practices that govern the field are not so picture-postcard. </p> <p>In a 10-month growing season, it has been sprayed with herbicides, pesticides and growth regulators a minimum of seven times, as well as having two applications of liquid nitrogen. </p> <p>Frequency of spraying is not everything, since chemical concentration also counts. But, by any standards, this farming is intensive. And it is potentially toxic - at least to those directly involved. The seed grain planted last September was itself coated with fungicide. The hazard data printed on the sack ran to seven paragraphs, including the warning that PVC gloves and a respirator should be worn when filling the seed drill. </p> <p>\"This is not what someone with a weekend cottage wants to hear,\" says the farm manager responsible for the Horse Ground's 14 acres, plus another 2,000 acres. \"But we are producing a commodity, just as on a factory floor.\" He was prepared to speak about the field and the way it was farmed provided he was not named. \"We have to maximise return,\" he says. \"In the present financial climate, even the big farms are suffering.\" </p> <p>The grain the Horse Ground grows this year will fatten pigs and poultry. Feed wheat that fetched \u00a3120 a tonne in the mid-1990s now sells for less than \u00a360. </p> <p>\"Highly efficient farms are probably still an acceptable investment, but they are certainly not highly profitable,\" says Dr Dick Morris, senior lecturer in environmental systems at the Open University. \"Intensive agriculture is like a treadmill. The more you put in, the more you have to put in. If you sow treated grain, you've paid for the treatment as well as the grain, and you've probably chosen an expensive variety. Faced with that investment, you would have to put in other treatments necessary to protect it.\" </p> <p>Take out the herbicides, fungicides and insecticide and the yield would fall by a third from its current four tonnes an acre, the farm manager estimates. Take out the liquid nitrogen as well, and the yield would be down two-thirds. </p> <p>For the Horse Ground, that would mean a reduction in income from the anticipated \u00a33,250 to little more than \u00a31,000. The chemicals used on the field cost around \u00a3700 (\u00a350 an acre), and little labour is involved since the entire field can be sprayed in half an hour. So leaving out the chemicals saves little while slashing returns. </p> <p>The best organic farmers in the UK harvest 70% of average non-organic grain yields. But it takes years of altered management to reach this level, and it is almost impossible to succeed with organic arable farming unless animals are part of the system. And that would require prohibitive capital expenditure. </p> <p>Ironically, the Horse Ground was once part of a flourishing dairy unit, abandoned under the economic imperatives of the late 70s. \"We moved from dairying into arable, taking the subsidy available from the Common Market to cull the cows,\" recalls Archie Piper, then land agent responsible for the field. </p> <p>Cynics might suggest that as a result the field switched from contributing to a milk lake to contributing to a grain mountain. But Morris contends: \"There were intermittent surpluses at the time, but in global terms they were molehills.\" </p> <p>Whatever the economics at play, the 70s switch out of dairying ended at least 500 years of pastoral use. But the Horse Ground's long history as pasture began with an equally hard-headed financial decision. In the late 15th century the future was not cereals but sheep. Wool destined for the continent was England's dominant export. </p> <p>\"At the time, part of the Horse Ground was cultivated, but about a third of it was lived on,\" says Tim Copeland, an archaeologist who knows the area well. \"It might have been home to 50 people. But it was more profitable for the lord of the manor to have a herd of sheep than a dozen tenants, and they would simply have been forced out.\" The abandoned village left its mark on the landscape for five centuries, until it was obliterated by the 70s' ploughing that prepared the ground for grain. </p> <p>That was a loss to archaeology. But the environmental costs of farming the Horse Ground so intensively are probably more pressing. </p> <p>Aside from the potential accumulation of chemical residues in food, pesticides and herbicides contaminate water supplies. Since privatisation, the water companies have spent an additional \u00a3970m in removing pollutants from drinking water. But they regard farmers as less to blame than local authorities and railway companies who spray herbicides on to hard surfaces with rapid run-off. A reduced range of flora and fauna is the undisputed price we pay for intensive farming. </p> <p>What we gain from it is ample home-produced food. For Neil, who ploughs, plants, sprays and harvests the Horse Ground, that is a significant achievement. \"I sometimes wish people in this country would go hungry for a while,\" he says. \"Then they'd appreciate farming more.\" </p> <p>Even on a small scale, commercial and environmental considerations do not always pull in different directions. Today's tight profit margins mean that, for example, agrochemicals that increase yield by 10%, but costs more than farmers recoup on the extra grain, will no longer be used. </p> <p> And there is an appreciation that integrated crop management can maintain yields while lessening input of costly chemicals. One year in five, peas are grown to fix nitrogen in the soil, reducing the need for fertiliser. </p> <p>The wheat the Horse Ground grows does not go to the mill at nearby Shipton-under-Wychwood, but prices there indicate the extra cost of not using chemicals. Organic Cotswold flour is 20% more expensive than the non-organic equivalent. If more consumers are prepared to pay that premium, history suggests that agriculture will respond. </p> <p>The two big changes in the last millennium - when the Horse Ground shifted from arable land to pasture and back again - were both driven by economics. Pottery shards Copeland dug from the field show the Romans used the land, which lies close to the site of a large villa. \"The Romans practised what we would recognise as commercial agriculture,\" he says. \"And it is likely that even then someone was counting the sestertia it generated.\"</p> <p><strong>Field diary</strong></p> <p><strong> Early September last year:</strong> pre-sowing application of herbicide. </p> <p><strong> September:</strong> sowing of wheat treated with fungicide to prevent seedling diseases such as blight. </p> <p><strong> Late autumn: </strong> second treatment with herbicide. </p> <p><strong> March: </strong> first application of liquid nitrogen; growth regulator to shorten and strengthen wheat stem (varieties bred for high yield have a large ear that needs support); fungicide. </p> <p><strong> April: </strong> second application of nitrogen fertiliser. </p> <p><strong> Mid-May: </strong> treatment with fungicide; growth regulator; insecticide (if needed) to combat thunderbugs and aphids. </p> <p><strong> At any time: </strong> herbicide applied to control specific weed problems - such as cleavers (known as \"sticky willy\") that might strangle the crop. </p> <p><strong> August: </strong> harvest.</p>",
  "<p>A 90-year-old woman from south London is discharged from hospital to a nursing home, her care paid by the local council. Two months later, she dies of blood poisoning brought on by necrotic bedsores. The council blames the hospital for discharging her too early and claims no responsibility for the quality of her clinical care. Her relative has to complain both to the health service and local government ombudsmen to get a proper explanation. </p> <p>Neighbours of a residential home in the west country complain to the council about smell from the home's sewerage; the council says it can't act because the environment agency has approved the quality of the effluent. </p> <p>Wherever you look, real life spills over the boundaries between local and central government. Ministers have recognised this and efforts are being made to \"join up\" services. But if people are aggrieved by a service failure, to whom should they complain? The joint provider first, certainly. But then the council? The health authority? The health provider? All of them? </p> <p>That's why, almost two years ago, the public sector ombudsmen for England proposed a one-stop shop for complainants, so the ombudsmen could follow the complaint across any boundary. It was potentially a small but significant proposal to join up government at a pinch point for the citizen. </p> <p>Once stated, it seems self-evidently desirable. But I imagine it might have looked less straightforward from inside the varied constituencies involved: the whole of Whitehall, where departments had grown their own complaint-handling services; local government, justly jealous of its constitutional status; and MPs, who currently act as gatekeepers for complaints about central government and its agencies. Then there were implications for Scotland and Wales and - another jigsaw entirely - for the revolution taking place in civil justice, including the ever-growing compass of judicial review. </p> <p>With many tender toes to dance around, it was to the government's credit that it didn't say \"too difficult\". Indeed, things have moved fast. In April, following a review, the cabinet office recommended merger of the public sector ombudsmen and the end of the MP filter. Ministers issued a consultation paper on reform, out for comment until September 29. </p> <p>Merger would radically transform ombudsman arrangements established piecemeal since 1967. About 25 or 30 years ago, boundaries between various parts of the public service seemed set in stone. It just isn't like that any more. </p> <p>\u0095 Jerry White is a local government ombudsman for England</p>",
  "<p>Bob Prevedell has fireflies, tree frogs, owls and plenty of other wildlife on his farm in Illinois. He would be a great advert for the environmental benefits of GM crops, except that he doesn't grow them. His 1,200-acre spread, with many oak trees, is as pretty as any stretch of English countryside and has at least as much wildlife - including deer, far more than it ever used to. </p> <p>The US department of agriculture would like to think that this is because many of the neighbouring farmers grow GM crops which, its scientists say, use far less insecticides and herbicides than conventional crops. So far Prevedell remains unconvinced. The recovery of the wildlife started years before, he says, when the worst effects of DDT and other more potent killers were phased out in favour of less harmful successors. </p> <p>His hundreds of acres of soya are grown by conventional methods, not because he objects to GM, but because he refused to sign an open-ended contract with Monsanto which bound him to buy their seed and allowed them to send inspectors to his farm and sue him if he broke rules which he believed infringed his freedom. \"It dictated what I could and could not do on my own farm,\" he says. \"And I was not having that.\" </p> <p>He has grown BT maize with seed from another company. This is the sort that kills the European corn borer as it burrows into the plant, and so avoids the need to spray for a pest which can typically reduce yields by 25%. So far, however, he sees no economic advantage. In the three years he has grown it alongside the conventional crops, the corn borer has been absent in both, and the BT seed is far more expensive to buy. One day, when the corn borer returns, he may change his mind, he says. </p> <p>The backlash of the British consumer against GM crops took the US administration by surprise. Despite the official reaction that UK fears were groundless, and threats of action through the World Trade Organisation because labelling for GM is a restraint on trade, the adminstration admits that matters might have been handled better. There is genuine alarm that EU objections might damage the advance of the technology. </p> <p>Among those responsible for the mistakes is Monsanto. Hugh Grant, chief operating officer of the company, admitted his company's attempt to steamroller Europe into accepting the technology had been a blunder. He remained convinced of the benefits of GM, particularly to the developing world, but \"we have decided to back off in Europe for at least two years. After that we will review the situation\". </p> <p>In the US, the technology proceeded without even a ripple of concern among consumers until the EU backlash became news. Interest peaked when lab research showed that larvae of the Monarch butterfly were killed by BT corn pollen if their food plant, the milkweed, was covered in it. This single piece of evidence showed up a giant gap in the US research programme: that the wider environmental impacts of growing GM crops had not been properly investigated, despite the fact that nearly half of all staple crops are now GM. </p> <p>This omission has cost the industry and the administration dear, not least because it has given the UK a copper-bottomed excuse to hold up the introduction of GM crops, until the effect on the wider British environment can be studied. </p> <p>The latest research on the Monarch butterfly, a potent symbol in the US of a healthy environment, is that GM crops do not lessen its chances of survival. Although BT pollen is toxic to the larvae, and other caterpillars, the insecticides and herbicides poured on conventional crops are probably more likely to destroy the wildlife than the GM equivalent. More research is being completed this summer. </p> <p>But stand in a conventionally grown English cornfield just before harvest, after it has been dosed with fertiliser, insecticide and herbicide throughout the year, and there is not much left alive. </p> <p>So far there is not enough evidence of advantage either way. At least consumer concern has forced both sets of complacent authorities to research the issue thoroughly.</p>",
  "All pensioners are to receive at least half-price bus travel under a \u00a350m scheme to be unveiled by the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, today. <p>The government will pay local authorities 50% of the cost of bus journeys in their area by women over 60 and men over 65. </p> <p>At the same time the government will abolish charges, that average \u00a35, for concessionary cards. </p> <p>Mr Prescott, who will announce the scheme in Pimlico, central London, said: \"For decades pensioners have campaigned for a scheme like this. Now we are giving it to them. </p> <p>\"It will mean cheap fares for all our senior citizens and will especially benefit the 4m of them who have no access to a card.\" </p> <p>The scheme, run by Mr Prescott's Transport, Environment and the Regions Department, will come into force in April 2001. </p> <p>It comes less than a month after Mr Prescott announced details of the national plan on transport spending as part of the government's comprehensive spending review. </p> <p>Announcing his satisfaction at the outcome of the review last month, in which transport was a major beneficiary, Mr Prescott said: \"Better transport is a key element of a prosperous economy and is essential to help improve the competitiveness of British business. </p> <p>\"The plans will help end decades of underinvestment.\" </p> <p>A Labour party spokesman said of today's announcement: \"It will mean free concessionary fares for senior citizens all over Britain, abolishing the need for them to pay for their concessionary cards.\" </p> <p>\"At present some parts of the country have no concessionary scheme at all.

  "South Africa's president, Thabo Mbeki, is to lobby Tony Blair to \"honour Britain's obligations\" and fund the rapidly expanding land seizures in Zimbabwe. <p>A summit of 11 southern African leaders has handed Robert Mugabe a diplomatic victory by appointing Mr Mbeki and Malawi's president, Bakili Muluzi, to put pressure on Britain after backing unequivocally the Zimbabwean leader's policy of expropriating white-owned land for redistribution to poor blacks. </p> <p>The regional presidents said in a statement: \"We are convinced that to have a land reform programme which is fair and just to all the stakeholders it is imperative for the UK government to honour its obligations under the Lancaster House agreement to provide resources for that purpose. </p> <p>\"We reiterate our acceptance of the urgent need to effect land redistribution in Zimbabwe to address land hunger and poverty affecting millions of black Zimbabweans.\" </p> <p>Mr Mugabe argues that Margaret Thatcher's government agreed to fund land reform as part of the Lancaster House settlement which ended minority rule in Zimbabwe 20 years ago. </p> <p>Mr Mugabe's spokesman, George Charamba, yesterday urged London to \"open a new chapter\" in relations with its former colony. \"The British have acted irresponsibly. They still have a colonial mind,\" he said. </p> <p>South African diplomatic sources said it was likely Mr Mbeki would seek a meeting with Mr Blair on the issue. The South African president has already made clear his belief that Britain should fund the land acquisitions but he has also called on Mr Mugabe to adhere to the rule of law. </p> <p>Britain has said it will unfreeze a \u00a336m donation to help pay for land redistribution but only once the illegal and sometimes violent occupation of white-owned farms by the self-styled \"war veterans\" is ended. The minister for Africa, Peter Hain, said in June that the government would not write \"a blank cheque\" to Zimbabwe. </p> <p>The land seizures have continued with the government bussing hundreds of families on to farms served with confiscation orders in recent days and fresh invasions of other land by the veterans. Mr Mugabe says he plans to move 500,000 families on to more than 3,000 expropriated farms, about two-thirds of all the white-owned commercial land. </p> <p>Despite the impact of Zimbabwe's deepening economic woes on its neighbours, some of which have seen their currencies dragged down by the crisis, southern African leaders left no doubt where they stand. They welcomed Mr Mugabe's assurance that the land reform programme would be \"handled peacefully, and within the provisions of the laws of Zimbabwe\", but made no reference to the war veterans' violence or the failure to obey court orders to stop the illegal land seizures. </p> <p>Zimbabwe's foreign minister, Stan Mudenge, hailed re gional support for Mr Mugabe's position as unqualified. \"It was full backing for the need for land reform,\" he said. </p> <p>The southern African presidents also praised Zimbabwe's parliamentary election in June for being held \"in a transparent, peaceful, free and fair environment\", without noting the political violence that cost 31 lives and other intimidation highlighted by the European Union and other monitors. </p> <p>If Zimbabwe had a problem, they said, it was that the foreign press had misrepresented Mr Mugabe's policies. \"We are disappointed by the partisan and biased manner in which a sector of the international media has misrepresented the land policy of the government of Zimbabwe which seeks to effect a just and equitable redistribution of land in a situation where 1% of the population owns over 70% of the best arable land,\" they said. </p> <p>The summit called on the US Congress to drop the proposed Zimbabwe democracy act which would impose financial sanctions on Mr Mugabe's administration because of the \"violence, intimidation and killings orchestrated and supported by the government\". </p> <p>The leaders said: \"This punitive piece of legislation is counterproductive and unjust because it will have far-reaching negative implications for the economic development and evolution of democratic institutions in Zimbabwe in particular and the region in general.\" </p> <p>But Mr Mugabe received a fresh reminder of the cost of his policies yesterday when South Africa's electricity generator, Eskom, warned that it might cut supplies to Zimbabwe because of 140m rand (\u00a314m) in unpaid bills. </p> <p>Harare is heavily reliant on South Africa for electricity.

  "<p>Cigarettes could kill a billion people this century, more than ten times the number who died of smoking-related diseases in the 20th century, a new report warned yesterday. </p> <p>About 4m smokers die each year, mostly in the rich world, according to the World Bank and the World Health Organisation. But with tobacco manufacturers increasingly targetting new markets in the developing world, the WHO and the bank estimate that by 2030 the global death total will have risen to 10m a year, with seven out of 10 deaths occuring in poor countries. </p> <p>\"Tobacco is rapidly becoming one of the single biggest causes of death worldwide,\" the report said. \"In rich countries, smoking is increasingly concentrated among the poor, and is responsible for much of their ill health and premature mortality.\" </p> <p>Industialized countries spend between six and 15% of their health budgets combatting tobacco related diseases. </p> <p>The WHO's campaign against smoking has made it enemies among tobacco manufacturers. Last week, in response to a WHO report alleging that tobacco manufacturers had conspired to subvert its work for more than two decades, Philip Morris, the world's largest cigarette company, admitted that it had paid scientists to infiltrate WHO meetings. </p> <p>The report, commissioned from a panel of outside experts, described the companies' campaign as an \"elaborate, well financed, sophisticated and usually invisible\" attempt to block the WHO's anti-tobacco initiatives. </p> <p>The latest report from the bank and the WHO argues that higher tobacco taxes are key to reducing deaths - a 10% rise in the cost of cigarettes could persuade 42m people to stop smoking and save 10m lives. Research shows that the incidence of smoking has dropped in developed countries as taxes have risen. Higher taxes, according to the report, are a better deterrent than health warnings and public campaigns. </p> <p>\"Governments wishing to halt the rising toll of tobacco-related deaths should strongly consider a tobacco tax hike as a matter of priority,\" said Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland, WHO's director-general. </p> <p>A total ban on cigarette advertising and smoking restrictions in public places would inspire 23m smokers to quit and prevent a further 5m deaths. But the report notes that partial advertising bans, like one in Britain, have little effect. </p> <p>Almost one in three cigarettes bought worldwide have been been smuggled, but the report says corruption is a bigger factor in the illicit trade than taxes. When countries try to tackle smuggling by slashing taxes, cigarette consumption rises.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.colt-telecom.com/netscape_site/index_fl.htm\">Colt Telecom's</a> chief executive, Paul Chisholm, shocked the market yesterday when he announced his intention to quit - sending the network operator's shares into rapid descent. </p> <p>Colt's shares fell almost 9% to \u00a319.65 as investors digested the news that the American who helped steer it to its present success was leaving. </p> <p>No date was set for Mr Chisholm's departure, though he apparently intends to remain as an adviser member of the board. </p> <p>Mr Chisholm said he was leaving Colt in order to be with his family in Boston. He joined the company in 1992 from Teleport Communications Boston, and holds about 2.4m shares in the group. Colt is 51% owned by the American investment group, Fidelity. </p> <p>Phil Campbell, an analyst at Schroder Salomon Smith Barney, said of the resignation: \"It's a little bit of a shock. The shares are basically down on the back of that.\" </p> <p>The company is searching both internally and externally for a replacement. </p> <p>The executive's resignation did adversely affect the reception of Colt's second-quarter results. The company reported that earnings before interest, tax, depreciation improved from \u00a3845,000 to \u00a31.6m. </p> <p>It was Colt Telecom's fourth consecutive reporting of positive data. Analysts were expecting the group to report a loss of \u00a31.35m. </p> <p>Pre-tax losses, however, widened from \u00a326.4m to \u00a333.7m, with analysts not expecting the group to break even until 2003. </p> <p>Colt Telecom's turnover rose from \u00a394.3m to \u00a3151m - with some two-thirds of that being generated outside Britain. </p> <p>\"The numbers are very good and are better than expectations,\" Mr Campbell said. </p> <p>However, most forecasts for the company's full-year results were held steady - given the margin pressure expected from the substantial costs related to the development of website hosting and asymetric digital subscriber line, or ADSL, services. </p> <p>Colt Telecom provides high bandwidth data, internet and voice services to business and government customers in 22 European cities. </p> <p>It expects to introduce its ADSL services in Germany and the Netherlands during the fourth quarter of this year. </p> <p>The company has six website hosting centres. </p> <p>Colt's strong sales growth in the quarter was driven by increasing demand for its services; it added high-profile clients <a href=\"http://www.semagroup.com/\">Sema</a> , <a href=\"http://www.axa.co.uk/\">Axa</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/welcome.html\">Bloomberg</a> in the same period. </p> <p>The company also won a new contract for voice services for the London borough of Hammersmith, and is providing internet hosting for <a href=\"http://www.channel5.co.uk/frameset/index.asp?\"> Channel 5 </a> and <a href=\"http://www.iir.co.uk/mobilebilling/welcome.htm\"> Copernicus Global Billing</a>, a multi-service billing application service provider. </p> <p>\"Strong demand for our range of high bandwidth data, internet and voice services, an expanding product and service portfolio and extended market reach have all contributed to an excellent second quarter performance,\" said Jim Curvey, chairman of Colt. </p> <p>\"We remain confident about the outlook for the rest of the year and beyond.\" </p> <p>Colt Telecom also has a joint venture with network group <a href=\"http://www.cisco.com/\">Cisco Systems</a> to develop net protocol services. The company expects its future growth to rely on the provision of business and government customers with net and software application services from its website hosting centres.</p>",
  "The hamlet of Over Stowey, nestling in Somerset's Quantock Hills, would be a suitable place to house 74 asylum seekers, a planning inquiry ruled yesterday. <p>Residents and parish councillors in the all-white community of 314 reacted with shock and disbelief at the news that the planning inspectorate had overturned Sedgemoor district council's refusal to approve a planned hostel for asylum seekers. </p> <p>The Baptist charity Kaleidoscope said it now hoped to turn the former Quantocks boarding school into a temporary sanctuary for refugees from the Balkans, Sudan and Sierra Leone. It planned to keep them occupied with English lessons, sports and swimming while the Home Office decided on their cases. During the case, the charity argued that there was a need to rehouse asylum seekers to take the pressure off the south-east and London. </p> <p>Embittered residents said the decision was a \"disaster\" for the local community, which has already been divided by the proposals. </p> <p>Rocketing crime, begging, racial tension, and plummeting house prices could result, said residents, who have been backed by Tom King, the MP for Bridgwater and former Tory defence secretary. He sent a letter of objection to the planning inquiry. </p> <p>The asylum seekers would be housed in two dormitory blocks. Some would be given full board but the rest would receive food vouchers worth \u00a330 a week to spend in local supermarkets. Medical care would be provided by local GPs and the asylum seekers would be bussed into Bristol and Bridgwater for shopping trips, and to see their lawyers. There would also be an on-site team of counsellors. </p> <p>Arthur Barrow, 55, who has lived in Over Stowey all his life, said the sale of his \u00a3600,000 farm collapsed yesterday after the purchasers said they would only buy his property if the decision went against the scheme. He described the ruling as \"despicable\". </p> <p>\"The majority of these asylum seekers will be 18 to 40. They are in an isolated rural area with nothing for them to do. I can't start to imagine the effect this will have on the area. Property values will plummet. </p> <p>\"I am resigning as a parish councillor forthwith. What point is there in having a parish council that acted on the wishes of the majority of the parish when its views are overturned?\" </p> <p>Chairman of the parish council, Mike Lampson, said: \"Planning permission lasts for five years so even if the family that owns the old school decides not to go ahead and sells it, another buyer could still push ahead with the asylum scheme. It is a total disaster for the area.\" </p> <p>The chairman of the planning inquiry, Philip Wilson, an architect who was appointed by the environment secretary, John Prescott, said the appeal proposal had been prompted by a \"need arising from guidance issued by central government to ensure asylum seekers do not become concentrated in specific areas\". </p> <p>\"I recognise the fear of some local residents concerning the presence of people from other ethnic backgrounds. I consider this is, in most cases, genuine but I do not consider it to be well-founded,\" he wrote. The Rev Martin Blakebrough, director of Kaleidoscope, said the centre would have 15 staff and the asylum seekers, including three families, would stay up to six months. </p> <p>The former school, where Mr Blakebrough's uncle was headmaster, had approached the charity. He acknowledged that there were some strong feelings against the scheme, but said he felt that much of the acrimony had been \"whipped up\" by the rightwing press. </p> <p>\"The whole aim is to provide an environment where people can access support and work through trauma in a tranquil environment. People can be assured that it if did go wrong, we would close it. We are not there to make a profit from these people like ruthless landlords, but we will obviously recoup our costs.\" </p> <p>The local vicar, the Rev Phil Denison, said: \"Everything was taken into consideration at the hearing and those in the best position to judge these matters have made what they feel is the right decision. </p> <p>\"Somerset and Over Stowey are cosmopolitan places and have always been enriched by receiving visitors. I feel we will only benefit from having a more multicultural society here. Perhaps some people have invested quite a lot of time and money in opposing the scheme and don't like losing.\"</p>",
  "<p>BP yesterday promised a resurgence in North Sea activity, earmarking almost \u00a3664m to be spent on a range of projects in untapped reserves. </p> <p>Spending next year is to be increased further in what the petrochemicals group described as an \"exciting\" area as oil prices remain close to a nine-year high.</p> <p>The global oil industry's second largest company is awash with cash after reporting record second-quarter profits - 164% higher at \u00a32.4bn - and is under pressure to spend it or give it back to shareholders through buybacks.</p> <p>Chief executive Sir John Browne said BP had encouraging oil and gas discoveries in offshore US fields, Angola and the Caspian Sea, but that the UK sector should not be seen as an area in decline.</p> <p>\"Obituaries for the North Sea have been written somewhat prematurely. There are some exciting things to do, and North Sea investment is rising for several reasons,\" he said, pointing to developments in technology with advanced control systems and enhanced recovery techniques.</p> <p>BP's production of crude and natural gas in the UK sector fell in the first half of the year to 550,000 barrels a day from 575,000 in the same period last year, but overall North Sea output is not in decline.</p> <p>Experts say the number of offshore jobs is unlikely to increase, and yards that build big platforms will continue to struggle as oil is produced via hi-tech sub-acquatic systems controlled from the shore.</p> <p>BP plans to raise its overall capital spend by \u00a3900m to \u00a38.9bn per annum over the next three years as it aims to increase oil production by up to 5% each year and gas output by nearly 10%.</p> <p>Capital spending in the second quarter was \u00a31.6bn, up 35% compared with 12 months ago - of which \u00a3199m went to the North Sea.</p> <p>The record pro-forma result, adjusted for special items, at \u00a32.4bn compared with analyst expectations of \u00a32.19bn to \u00a32.3bn and came on the back of strong crude prices and cost-cutting undertaken following a series of mergers.</p> <p>But the company came under fire from financial analysts at a presentation to them in London. They argued that the series of mergers had made it difficult to compare like with like. Mark Horn, an oil analyst with T Hoare, said afterwards: \"We are told they [the figures] are good, but it's not that easy to measure them.\"</p> <p>Sir John tacitly admitted he was frustrated that the BP share price had underperformed those of its peers, and accepted that the takeover of Amoco, Arco, Vastar Resources and then Burmah Castrol had clouded the picture for investors.</p> <p>The future should be better, he insisted \"now we can demonstrate with simplicity what the results have been\".</p> <p>The BP chairman said the group had continued to beat its targets on savings with the integration of BP and Arco saving up to \u00a3600m during the last six months.</p> <p>\"These results represent the cumulative impact of the progress we've made over the last few years - growth in volume and, equally important, growth in total productivity,\" he explained.</p> <p>BP claimed to have a return on capital of 21%, whereas Shell last week said it was on par with Exxon Mobil at 16%. The American oil group, which is the world's largest, reported a 123% rise in second-quarter profits while Shell showed a 95% growth. Analysts said each had used different calculations to produce their data. BP shares ended the day down 14p at 593p.</p>",
  "<p>Members of the Smith family, who founded the health care corporation Smith &amp; Nephew, are upset about the company's decision to sell its Elastoplast dressings brand, it emerged yesterday. </p> <p>Descendants of the Hull pharmacist who established the 144-year-old company told the firm's chief executive, Chris O'Donnell, of their reservations about the disposal at Smith &amp; Nephew's extraordinary shareholders' meeting earlier this month. </p> <p>Mr O'Donnell said: \"They're sad to see Elastoplast go on a personal level. It's been part of the business since about 1935.\" </p> <p>Smith &amp; Nephew has sold Elastoplast to Beiersdorf, a German health care company, as part of its strategy of shifting from consumer goods to hi-tech medical devices. </p> <p>Mr O'Donnell wants to concentrate on products such as artificial joints, endoscopy tools and dressings grafted from human skin. </p> <p>Smith &amp; Nephew's latest reinvention takes it a long way from its origins - the company originally specialised in cod liver oil. It moved into dressings in a big way to treat soldiers injured in the first world war. </p> <p>Several members of the founding family, some with the surname Charlton, still have small shareholdings and retain an active interest. Mr O'Donnell said: \"Usually they come to shareholders' meetings, although I don't consult them about strategic issues.\" </p> <p>He defended the sale of Elastoplast, saying that it needed to be part of a bigger organisation: \"It's a very well known brand. You need to have a global franchise in first-aid dressings,\" he insisted. </p> <p>Other sales have included Nivea soap and Lillets tampons. The reorganisation has been well received in the City - Smith &amp; Nephew's shares rose 23.75p to 276.5p yesterday after an 8% rise in half-year profits to \u00a391.3m. </p> <p>Growth was driven by sales of artificial hips and knees - which can cost anything up to \u00a35,000 each, depending on the amount of mobility patients require. The group is close to agreeing a joint venture with Beiersdorf to collaborate on bandages and castings. </p> <p>An announcement is likely at some time next month, and Mr O'Donnell warned that this could mean job losses in Smith &amp; Nephew's wound care division. </p> <p>Smith &amp; Nephew has high hopes for Trivex - a new device designed to remove varicose veins quickly and easily. </p> <p>It expects to launch Dermagraft - a dressing for foot ulcers which is made from baby boys' foreskins, in the United States next year.</p>",
  "<p>Shares in Kingfisher, the company behind Woolworths and B&amp;Q, leapt 16p to 529p yesterday after heavyweight broker Merrill Lynch upgraded its near-term rating on the stock to \"buy\" from \"neutral\" and set a 12-month price target of 620p. The move followed a meeting with the company that left Merrill analyst Mal Patel with the view that the group was undervalued. </p> <p>In the past month Kingfisher shares have fallen around 25% as a number of brokers have moved to reduce their forecasts to take account of the tough trading environment for general merchandise and the costs of rolling out new formats. This has left the stock trading on a 2001 price-to-earnings ratio of around 16, which Mr Patel feels more than discounts risks. </p> <p>Mr Patel believes the company will use interim results, due on September 13, to reassure the market regarding its strategy and earnings prospects. This, he feels, will justify a re-rating for the shares.</p>"
