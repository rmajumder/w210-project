[
  "<p>\"Let me start by saying how pleased I was to be asked to deliver the MacTaggart lecture in this the 25th year of the Edinburgh International Television Festival. </p> <p> I wasn't here for the first few years but I have been coming on and off for most of the Festival's existence. </p> <p> Three things have changed fundamentally since those early days. Firstly the size and professionalism of the festival has changed beyond recognition. </p> <p> Secondly the price of hotels in Edinburgh for this particular weekend have gone through the roof. </p> <p> Finally, and the biggest change of all, my friend Gus MacDonald has gone from being a radical programme maker with strong far left credentials to become Lord MacDonald of Tradeston. </p> <p> Gus, 25 years ago the only thing less likely than me becoming Director-General of the BBC was you agreeing to become a member of the House of Lords. </p> <p> Actually I'm the first ever Director-General never to have worked for the BBC before taking on the role. I only ever applied for two jobs at the BBC - the first in 1970 as a reporter on Radio Teeside, which I failed to get, and the second nearly 30 years later as Director-General. </p> <p> I am also flattered to be the first person ever to deliver the MacTaggart lecture twice, although there is one big drawback to that. I used all my best jokes the first time. So forgive me if my lecture here tonight is unremittingly serious and I realise that as a result, some will think that I've gone completely native after less than a year at the BBC. </p> <p> In 1994, my lecture was about broadcasting and politics. My concern then was that the relationship between Government and broadcasters was in danger of becoming unhealthy; that as the world of broadcasting was changing broadcasters were always wanting something from the Government and, as such, were less likely to be brave in their programming when standing up to the Government of the day. </p> <p> I still have that concern - in fact the danger has grown. Broadcasters today want more from Government than we could possibly have imagined just six years ago. That is why the Government's decision to give the BBC a seven year licence fee agreement, right through to the end of the current BBC Charter, is important. It gives the BBC the freedom and independence to be brave. </p> <p> However we all still need to be vigilant in the area of political independence and I am particularly concerned when I read of proposals for a single content regulator across the whole television industry. </p> <p> I believe we have a far better chance of resisting political pressure if, between us, we have more than one content regulator. Pluralism in regulation is as important as pluralism among broadcasters. </p> <p> But tonight I don't plan to talk about politics, I want to talk about change and why it is difficult to bring about in an organisation like the BBC. </p> <p> The Council Chamber in Broadcasting House at the BBC is an austere place where the windows are set so high that no one can see in or out. If you believe that is symbolic, beware - our new boardroom has no windows at all. </p> <p> As you go into the Council Chamber you will find something equally symbolic - the portraits of previous Directors-General hang on the walls around you to serve as a constant reminder of the BBC's heritage. </p> <p> In the spot above the mantelpiece, pride of place rightly goes to the BBC's founder, John Reith. The second best spot, directly opposite him, is taken by Hugh Carleton Greene. These are seen by many as the two truly great Directors-General. </p> <p> Now, the myth of the BBC is that there is a single flame, a single idea handed seamlessly from generation to generation. The flame is public service broadcasting and each generation understands its inheritance and fights not to change it but to defend it to the death. Having the previous Directors-General looking down upon you is no doubt intended to remind you that you tamper with it at your peril. </p> <p><strong>Echoes of the past</strong></p> <p> The truth, of course, is very different. John Reith - on your right as you walk into the Council Chamber - ended up disliking Greene, on the left, with an intense passion. Reith's view was that Greene had trivialised his great institution; that Greene had - dare I use the words - \"dumbed down\" the BBC. As Reith put it when talking about Greene, \"I lead, he follows the crowd in all the disgusting manifestations of the age\u00bf Without any reservation he gives the public what it wants; I would not, did not and said I wouldn't. I am very annoyed that I even got on to terms with him\". </p> <p> In fact, many of the changes attributed to Greene had actually been started by his predecessor Sir Ian Jacob. Reith's views of Jacob were similar to his views of Greene. When he heard Jacob's portrait was going to be hung in the Council Chamber, Reith was so angry that he demanded that his own portrait be removed. </p> <p> What had Jacob and Greene actually done to so upset the BBC's founder? The story is very illuminating. </p> <p> Under Jacob, Greene had been Director of News and Current Affairs and had set about introducing radical change. </p> <p> In the mid-fifties the great joke about BBC News was that every newsreel would begin, \"The Queen Mother yesterday\u00bf\". I do, of course, realise that I am on dangerous ground when talking of the Queen Mother, but I'll take the risk. </p> <p> Back to the joke. All newsreels started \"The Queen Mother yesterday\". The Queen Mother because everyone loved the Queen Mother; and yesterday because it took the BBC at least a day to check with the Queen Mother that she had done what she was said to have done, even though they had film of her doing it. </p> <p> Greene set about changing the whole journalistic ethos of the BBC, transforming a largely obsequious and deferential institution into a gritty news organisation that could respond swiftly and imaginatively. At the heart of the changes were two extremely controversial views, though: firstly that television not newspapers would prove to be the bedrock of news reporting in the future; and secondly that news and current affairs had to be less isolated from the rest of the BBC.</p> <p><strong>ITV on the scene</strong></p> <p> It was out of these twin beliefs that truly ground-breaking genre-defying programmes like Cathy Come Home were later to spring. </p> <p> After two years running News and Current Affairs, Greene became Director-General in 1960 at a time of real turmoil in the industry. Interestingly on becoming Director-General one of Greene's first actions was to move the nine o'clock news on the old Home Service, now Radio Four, to ten o'clock. You will not be surprised to know that the decision was ferociously attacked at the time. </p> <p> By 1960 BBC Television was in real trouble. ITV had come into existence in 1954 and after a difficult start was making life very hard for the BBC. BBC Television's share had gone from 100% to 34% in only six years, and remember this was still only a two channel world. </p> <p> With quiz programmes like Double Your Money, Take Your Pick and a raft of popular American series, ITV was stealing the hearts and minds of British viewers. Meanwhile BBC Television, obsessed with its own importance, was inward looking and hardly seemed to notice what was going on. </p> <p> Jacob and Greene set about changing this. For the first time British audiences were to be offered a diet of programming that was both challenging and popular, programmes like Play for Today, Z Cars, The Forsyte Saga, That Was the Week That Was, Til Death Us Do Part, Doctor Who, Monty Python's Flying Circus and literally dozens of others. </p> <p> It wasn't that Greene produced these programmes, of course he didn't. But he did make them possible. He gave BBC producers the ambition to make popular quality programming for the first time - programmes which both appealed to large audiences and made a difference to their lives. In rating terms, the BBC made a great recovery which left ITV with no option but to follow the BBC's lead, effectively making Greene the founder of modern day British television. </p> <p><strong>Radio reforms</strong></p> <p> And it didn't end with television either. When Radio Caroline and other pirate stations started broadcasting under a Panamanian flag of convenience in 1964 he not only argued that they should be closed down, but along with Frank Gillard, his legendary head of radio, he put in place the now familiar pattern of Radios 1, 2, 3 and 4. Imagine the fuss that caused. </p> <p> Greene and Gillard's reforms of radio and television brought cries of derision. A Times leader accused the BBC of \"abandoning their role as the sponsors and protectors of quality broadcasting\". </p> <p> Even the now seemingly innocuous Z Cars received its fair share of condemnation. The Chief Constable of Lancashire, Colonel Eric St Johnstone, demanded that it be cancelled. His force, to a man, he complained, were full of disgust. </p> <p> Mary Whitehouse complained about the spate of modern plays on the BBC: \"We are told that the dramatists are portraying real life, but why concentrate on the kitchen sink when there are so many pleasant sitting rooms?\" No wonder she said of Greene: \"If you were to ask me who, above all, was responsible for the moral collapse which characterised the Sixties and Seventies, I would unhesitatingly name Sir Hugh Carleton Greene.\" </p> <p> Outrage from journalists, politicians, the great and the good and even some of the BBC's own staff at any mooted change in BBC radio or television is a pattern you can find throughout the history of the BBC. </p> <p> Just look at the last decade - changes within all of our memories. Remember the fuss and outrage when Matthew Bannister re-shaped and effectively re-invented Radio 1 in the mid Nineties? Yet Radio 1 is now seen as one of the great success stories of the BBC. </p> <p> Remember the fuss when the BBC created Radio Five Live with the idea of starting a radio station aimed at a younger audience and based around news and sport? Today Five Live is supreme in its field and its audience is still growing rapidly year by year. </p> <p> Remember when John Birt set up BBC Online? He was widely accused of wasting licence payers' money and yet now it is the most visited content site in Europe and widely loved by some of the very people who accused him of wasting money at the time. </p> <p><strong>Populism</strong></p> <p> Long before any of these recent examples, a few of you may remember Grace Archer's death in the Archers - which just happened to coincide with the opening night of ITV. It was greeted by Denis Pitts in the Daily Herald with the following denunciation: \"The BBC went too far on Thursday when, for the sake of a stunt, they killed off Grace Archer. The stunt was mean, callous and cold-blooded. I accuse the BBC of a shabby trick which has left an unpleasant taste in nine million mouths. I am angry. So is my wife.\" </p> <p> You have to wonder what his wife would have thought about EastEnders. </p> <p> In the sixties the opponents of change and in particular Greene's style of populism were everywhere. We now see Steptoe and Son as the great turning point in British situation comedy, a seminal series which helped pave the way for Dad's Army, 'Til Death Us Do Part, Fawlty Towers, Only Fools and Horses and many others. But it wasn't always perceived as that. </p> <p> Wilfrid Brambell - the Shakespearean actor who played Steptoe senior said at the time: \"I suppose every actor has to get into dustbin drama sooner or later\". </p> <p> One wonders if anyone today would ever have heard of Brambell if he hadn't got into \"dustbin drama\" - I rather doubt it. </p> <p> None of this is new. As the BBC's Chief Archivist described it to me, \"The BBC has been accused of dumbing down from the day Reith invented it.\" Propose any significant change and the BBC is accused of betraying its heritage. </p> <p> The point is that the real genius of the BBC is that it has adapted and changed over the years. Successive generations of leaders have not simply taken the flame of public service broadcasting as a whole and passed it on unchanged. At crucial times in the BBC's history they have recognised that change was essential and have taken the bold decision to introduce it despite loud protests from all around them. </p> <p> By and large history has rewarded their courage and their detractors have been forgotten. No Director-General was more criticised than Greene and yet today his memory is revered - without Greene there would not be the BBC as we know it. Reith invented the BBC for one age. Greene re-invented it for another. </p> <p> <strong>John Birt </strong></p> <p> Of course it's pretty obvious why there are so many howls when anyone wants to change even comparatively small parts of the BBC. </p> <p> It was Machiavelli, when writing The Prince, who summed it up when he wrote: \"There is nothing more difficult to plan, more doubtful of success, nor more dangerous to manage than the creation of a new system. </p> <p> \"For the initiator has the enmity of all who would profit by the preservation of the old institutions and merely lukewarm defenders in those who would gain by the new.\" </p> <p> Oddly when I looked up that quote in my files written on the same sheet was one which is less philosophical but equally applicable. It was from the former French President General De Gaulle who said, \"Never stand between the dog and the lamp post.\" </p> <p> So given this history, why try to change the BBC? </p> <p> Look at the venom directed at John Birt - the man who had the courage to start the modernisation process at the BBC. </p> <p> Why be radical in an age when attacks from sections of the press are more vicious and more personal than ever before; when the BBC's commercial competitors are more ruthless than they have ever been; and when some politicians and commentators seem more interested in quick headlines than in trying to understand the real issues? </p> <p> The answer, of course, is we have no option. I believe the stark choice facing the BBC today is that we either change or we simply manage decline gracefully and none of us joined the BBC to do that. </p> <p> <strong>Digital TV </strong></p> <p> The changes happening in technology; in the wider society; and in our competitive environment are what make this one of those times in history when change at the BBC is essential. </p> <p> Let's take technology first. Digital television, and with it as many as 160 channels in digital satellite homes, has arrived at a pace faster than any could have imagined, certainly faster than I anticipated when I gave this lecture six years ago. </p> <p> But we are only just beginning to see what digital television can really bring. Electronic programme guides are already changing viewing habits in digital homes dramatically, but the real revolution will come with the arrival of the TiVo box and similar in-home, hard disc recording technologies which will give the consumer complete freedom to watch what they want, when they want it. </p> <p> I still believe there will be a role for conventional channels by the end of this decade - at times people will still want informed selection - but the channels are likely to be more focused, and aimed either at particular audience groups or based on particular programme genres. </p> <p> <strong>Changing society </strong></p> <p> Secondly society is changing. Huge gulfs have opened up in the attitudes and values of different generations in a way not seen before.</p> <p> In recent research people from different age groups were asked if they agreed or disagreed with the following statement, \"There is too much sex, bad language and violence on TV and in cinema today.\" Amongst the over 45's 72% said they agreed. Amongst the 25 to 34 year olds 79% disagreed. </p> <p> This dramatic polarisation of views creates real challenges for programme makers, broadcasters and regulators alike, particularly in the areas of taste and decency. </p> <p> The people brought up in the Thatcher age are the biggest challenge of all whether you're a politician, the Chief Executive of Marks and Spencer or a television executive. </p> <p> For these are the children of the multichannel age, they are used to choice and love it - whether it's shopping, music or television and they are certainly not deferential to Britain's traditional institutions like the BBC. </p> <p> This generation doesn't complain if they don't like our schedules they simply turn over. \"Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells\" is disappearing and being replaced by \"Not bothered of Newcastle\". </p> <p> And as the retiring speaker of the House of Commons reminded us recently this is also a generation with very little interest in conventional politics. </p> <p> However what we know is that they are passionate about many of the important issues of our times, they just don't think Westminster politics can provide the answers. </p> <p> <strong> Competition </strong></p> <p> I believe this will become an increasingly serious problem for broadcasters and programme-makers steeped in a tradition of reporting conventional politics. </p> <p> If the BBC is to stay relevant over this decade we have to understand this generation and meet their needs, not only because they matter, but because we are all being influenced by them. In the old days kids wanted to be like their parents. These days parents, terrified of growing old, want to be more like their kids. </p> <p> As Bob Dylan wrote \"I was so much older then I'm younger than that now.\" </p> <p> The third reason the BBC has to change is that the BBC's competitive environment has changed and will be transformed beyond recognition in the next decade. Consolidation and merger are the order of the day amongst media companies. </p> <p> Our competitors today are bigger, richer and more ruthless than at any time in the BBC's history. They are increasingly part of a global media industry which has access to vast capital funds. This is competition on a scale the BBC has never seen before. </p> <p> It's this combination of factors which mean that this is one of those periods when the BBC, and BBC Television in particular, has to go through fundamental change. In the words of Margaret Thatcher, \"there is no alternative\". </p> <p> Inside the BBC we have been discussing the changes we need to make to our television channels since I first took over, as no doubt many of you have read in Broadcast and elsewhere. </p> <p> One thing I have discovered in that time is that there is no such thing as a confidential debate in the BBC, but if a few headlines are the price you pay for an open and questioning environment it is a price worth paying. </p> <p> At the BBC we all recognise that changing anything is difficult to achieve without controversy. But no-one feels this more keenly than our new Director of Television Mark Thompson who went to make the keynote speech at the Banff festival in Canada a couple of months ago. </p> <p> Mark took the opportunity to outline some ideas about the future of our television services in an intelligent and thought provoking speech. He opened the debate. </p> <p> Within days the forces of darkness came down upon him. He was accused of being a philistine with plans to turn BBC One into an all entertainment channel, which he didn't say and is not true, and relegating all serious programming to the fringes, again which he didn't say and is not true. </p> <p> It was all familiar stuff. Predictably the retired old men of the BBC came out in force to defend yesterday as they always have done and always will. Had they read the speech? I doubt it. Did they understand the arguments? Unlikely. They just want television the way it was in their day. But that simply isn't an option. </p> <p> <strong>New plans</strong></p> <p> So what are the changes we plan to make? </p> <p> Well one of the dangers of making this speech here today is, as our Head of Press said to me, I'm bound to disappoint. He told me \"people are expecting you to be Moses coming down from the mountain with tablets of stone\". </p> <p> Of course Moses had it easy - he only had to carry the stone, someone else had already worked out the messages. </p> <p> Let me make it clear, I haven't come here today with all the answers, there are no new Ten Commandments. </p> <p> What we do have are some exciting ideas for the future of BBC Television in the first decade of a new century which also happens to be the first decade of the digital age. Like all ideas some will succeed and others won't but that doesn't matter, this is only the start of a journey, the process of change is ongoing. </p> <p> Let me explain our plans in three parts. </p> <p> First of all I want to talk about money and what the BBC can and cannot afford to do. </p> <p> Secondly I'd like to talk about our proposals for a portfolio of BBC public service channels, which will eventually be available in every home in Britain. </p> <p> And finally I want to talk about the purpose of the BBC and public service broadcasting in the digital age. </p> <p> <strong>Money matters </strong></p> <p> Starting with the money then. One thing I have learned in my years in the television industry is that money matters when you're trying to make outstanding programmes. It's not enough on its own - at some time or other most of us have spent a lot of money producing a very average programme - but trying to make fantastic programmes without the right budget is incredibly difficult. </p> <p> In fact I believe one of the problems of BBC Television today is that too many of our services have been under funded. </p> <p> BBC One certainly needs more money, particularly for drama and quality entertainment and two of our digital services, BBC Choice and BBC Knowledge, were started without enough money to commission truly original and inspiring programmes, programming of the quality people expect from the BBC. </p> <p> If we want to spend more money on our traditional services, and we do need to, there are certain consequences. Firstly we have to find the money and secondly we have to limit our plans for new services to what we can afford. </p> <p> This year's licence fee settlement, which gave us an increase of inflation plus 1.5% every year for seven years was a fair, even generous, award. By 2007 this will produce a real increase</p>",
  "<p><strong>BIG UP BIG CUP</strong></p> <p>At last \u00d0 it's the return of the Big Cup TV Extravaganza, brought to you by the European Broadcasting Union (in association with Uefa)! The draw for the first round of prime-time viewing was made this morning, and it's been a mixed bag for the British sides. Mixed in the sense that everybody has done quite nicely out of it except Leeds, that is.</p> <p>The poor Yorkshire club are having a hellish nightmare \u00d0 they've got to go back to Istanbul, where two of their supporters were murdered last season, to play Besiktas. Hopefully all we'll need to concentrate on will be the football, although there won't be much comfort to be found there, because Barcelona and AC Milan are the other two teams in the group. Ah well.</p> <p>Of course, all Leeds fans will find solace in how much easier Manchester United have got it. The 5-1 favourites have been grouped with PSV Eindhoven, Dynamo Kiev and Anderlecht, a line-up which sounds daunting but, well, come off it. Meanwhile, Rangers will be losing last-minute goals to Monaco, Galatasaray and Sturm Graz, while Arsenal will be doing their level best to crash uselessly out of the first phase by playing Lazio, Sparta Prague and Shakhtar Donetsk. Shakhtar aren't a popular early-80s funk outfit, by the way, they're a Ukrainian football team.</p> <p><strong>COMPETITION: A QUICK KICKABOUT DOWN THE PARK </strong></p> <p>Fancy making an idiot of yourself by hoofing a ball around Wembley, climbing the famous 39 steps to get your hands on the FA Cup and generally behaving like an overgrown schoolkid? Thought so. </p> <p>The Guardian has teamed up with Wembley to offer two people the chance to put a team together and play in one of the last matches on the world's most hallowed turf. See the paper over the weekend for more details or go <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/eventsandoffers/article/0,5992,358932,00.html\">here</a>.</p> <p><strong>VIVA LAS VASE</strong></p> <p>Big Cup isn't the be all and end all of European football. Well, it is if you're head of advertising at ITV. But if you're not (you're not, are you?) there's as much fun to be had with Uefa's prestigious Euro Vase competition. The draw for the first round of the trophy that used to mean something was made early this afternoon, and while it wasn't as gripping a spectacle as the draw for Big Cup \u00d0 no Gerhard Aigner zig-zagging around the stage carefully holding a glass bowl full of paper here \u00d0 it was certainly as exciting.</p> <p>Leicester will certainly be roused, that's for sure, because they face a trip to \"war-torn\" Belgrade. They've been drawn against former European champions Red Star, so expect to see tabloid photos of Darren Eadie in a flak jacket and Stan Collymore prodding a bayonet into the still-twitching torso of a stricken Eastern European. Or something. Peter Taylor's men certainly have the toughest draw of the English sides: Chelsea play Swiss no-marks St Gallen, while Liverpool travel to Romania to meet Rapid Bucharest.</p> <p>Celtic and Hearts will have some sympathy with Taylor's plight, because they've also landed tricky draws, against HJK Helsinki and Stuttgart respectively. One team who will be happy, though, are Bohemians, who last night hilariously defeated Scottish First Division side Aberdeen (you know what we mean). They've been paired with massive German club Kaiserslautern, so that should be an interesting match. Do you think ITV Network Centre are already on the phone to tie up the rights?</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"Oleg [Luzhny] told me it is a hostile place to go, a long journey, only an average stadium and no really good hotels\" \u00d0 Arsene Wenger looks to have it large in Donetsk.</p> <p><strong>ZIEGE JOINS LIVERPOOL SHOCK... ROBBO LOSES TEMPER SHOCK...</strong></p> <p>It's the sort of cheery, heart-warming, everyday tale that usually makes decent folk go \"ahh\". An ambitious young footballer finally outgrows his provincial club and heads \u00d0 reluctantly, and after plenty of honest, manly hugs and tears from former team-mates \u00d0 for the big leagues. So when the Fiver bumped into a weary Bryan Robson earlier today, we naturally assumed that his red face was the result of a late-night send-off to wish Christian Ziege all the best in his \u00a35.5m move to Liverpool, which finally went through today.</p> <p>Oh how wrong we were! Because Robbo, his finger jabbing way like a Presbyterian minister, soon uttered an Old Testament-style warning to Ziege's new club. \"Liverpool have brought problems on themselves now because Michael Owen and Steven Gerrard and people like that will probably be looking at the wages Ziege will be getting and they'll be wanting up amongst them or even more,\" he said, rattling a huge number of locusts in his cupped hand.</p> <p>Robbo then went onto claim that, despite there being a release clause in Ziege\u00d5s contract which says he could move if any club offered \u00a35.5m, he won\u00d5t stop until Liverpool give him the \u00a38m he feels the German is worth. \"Ziege will become a Liverpool player today. The only stumbling block that is still there at this moment is the valuation, and that will be an ongoing thing,\" he thundered tempestuously.</p> <p>Alas, just as the Fiver was tooling up with orthopterous insects to help him in his battle, Robbo started going all vague on us. \"I'm not quite sure how it's going to go forward,\" he spluttered. \"I'm just a manager who wants to get out on the training ground and train my players. That will be left to the chief executives and the chairmen of the clubs.\" And our jar of grasshoppers, Bryan, if you need any extra help.</p> <p><strong>THE RUMOUR MILL</strong></p> <p>Tottenham are the latest club to be linked to Steve McManaman. \"McManaman has important offers from all of English soccer,\" says Ernesto Bronchetti. \"But particularly Tottenham, Chelsea and Middlesbrough.\" Sunderland and Middlesbrough are both interested in Ugo Ehiogu.

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.gs.com/\" target_\"new\">Goldman Sachs</a>, the US investment bank, has slipped to sixth place in the tables for advising US technology companies on takeovers this year. </p> <p>Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse First Boston, which have both invested heavily in their technology banking teams, hold the leading positions for deals in the technology and internet sectors announced since the beginning of this year, according to figures compiled by Thomson Financial Securities Data. </p> <p>Goldman, top in the technology sector last year, has been overtaken in the first seven months of this year after failing to cash in on recent big deals. </p> <p>These include the $41bn merger of JDS Uniphase and SDL as well as the multi-billion dollar mergers of Verisign with Network Solutions and Lycos with Terra Networks. </p> <p>Goldman, which listed on the US stock market last year, has two reasons to take heart from this year's figures, however. One is that the total value of deals in the technology sector - at more than $262bn so far this year - is lower than at the same time last year - a bumper one. Goldman has also held its top ranking overall for mergers and acquisitions advice, largely because of a strong performance in advising telecommunications companies. </p> <p>If telecoms deals such as the Deutsche Telekom's $50bn bid for Voicesteam or France Telecom's takeover of Global One are included in the technology group, Goldman has advised on deals worth $140bn in the year to date, benefiting from its involvement in America Online's takeover of Time Warner and Vivendi's takeover of Seagram this year. </p> <p>However, Thomson Financial's figures confirm Morgan Stanley and CSFB as the banks of choice for software and internet companies. Morgan Stanley advised on 45 mergers worth more than $73bn in the technology sector, excluding telecoms.

  "<p>Ali G label lover? Little ragamuffin? The \"I just got back from Ayia Napa/ Goa/surfing in Cornwall, actually\" traveller? This weekend, two million revellers are expected to turn up at the 36th Notting Hill carnival. But forget about worrying whether you'll be able to meet up with your friends or if there will be any toilets. The far more demanding issue is the sartorial one, with the revellers in the crowd adopting as much fancy dress as the masqueraders on the floats. </p> <p>The carnival is a Caribbean festival of music, dress, food, drink and dance, so to arrive in your normal conservative style would make you appear the archetypal Englishman abroad and no one wants to look like a tourist in their own home town. The mood is just what you'd expect from a balmy, rum-soaked, relaxed afternoon in west London, so who can blame anyone for immersing themselves in it through their fashion? After all, who wants to party in a pinstripe suit? (It is all too easy, mind you, to get this wrong: distressing memories of William Hague's carnival appearance are only now starting to fade from public memory.) </p> <p>Inevitably, derivatives of Jamaican-influenced fashion (baggy man-made trousers, loose cotton shirts, brown sandals) will make their presence felt along the streets of W11. But far more popular, particularly with those desirous of a little street cred, is the Ghetto Fabulous look: enormous jeans, T-shirts weighted down with logos, fantastically eye-catching trainers. Just think Ali G. </p> <p>\"During carnival, everyone becomes little ragga kids,\" says Waj Hussain, press officer of Proibito, the popular streetwear clothing store that specialises in typically Ghetto Fabulous labels such as Versace Jeans Couture, Iceberg, D&amp;G and Gianfranco Ferre. \"Two years ago, we started getting in special clothes for the carnival, like loud Moschino shirts, lots of bright colours, baggy denim. You know, real 'innit fashion'.\" </p> <p>Which is rather odd considering the Ghetto Fabulous look emerged from the ghettos of New York and Los Angeles more than two decades ago and has little to do with the carnival's Caribbean spirit. Currently experiencing a bit of a fashion renaissance, thanks to Puff Daddy and Missy Elliott, Ghetto Fabulous is characterised by excess: ostentatious labels, enormous jeans and short, tight skirts. </p> <p>Popularised by rap stars in the 80s, the Ghetto Fabulous look was a defiant statement from young, disenfranchised black Americans, demonstrating their financial power and aspirations. Like rap music, the look acquired a kind of street credibility and was quickly adopted by non-black teenagers. </p> <p>\"We definitely get more white kids coming in at carnival time,\" Hussain says. \"All sorts of people want to fit in with this ragga style image - people from across the non-black middle-class spectrum. Everyone gets into the spirit; the whole of London collaborates in this One Nation idea.\" </p> <p>Some might carp that fashion from American inner-city ghettos is not strictly \"One Nation\" with that of Caribbean countries, but this is not the point. The sight of Caucasian teenagers wearing these clothes at the Notting Hill carnival represents the potent allure of that previously marginalised and ignored social group. What was once a plea to be acknowledged has become a powerful fashion statement in its own right. </p> <p>This is particularly apt at the Notting Hill carnival. Like Ghetto Fabulous fashion, the carnival was partly born out of a feeling of ghettoisation. It originated as a reaction to the racism still endemic in Britain in the early 60s and the practical difficulties black people faced, such as lack of work and poor housing, and from the local Caribbean community's desire to bring their traditions to a new country. Hence the arrival of a Trinidad-style carnival, marching and dancing its way through streets with names such as Blenheim Road and Kensington Park Road, the masqueraders dressed up in gloriously opulent and improbably large costumes. </p> <p>In Oval House in south-east London, volunteers at South Connections Band - one of the 60-odd \"bands\" of designers working on this year's carnival costumes - are sewing patterns, shaping wires, rehearsing dance moves and occasionally relaxing over (very brief) cups of tea. Drawings of this year's wildly ornate prospective patterns surround them. </p> <p>\"There are still huge numbers of people at the carnival who remember why they are here: to present a wonderful image of themselves in what was initially a hostile community,\" explains Ros Price, administrator for South Connections Band. \"In carnivals in other parts of the world, where people feel more secure socially, they will make social comment through their clothes and wear rags. In Notting Hill, though, they want to go out looking and feeling a million dollars, which is in itself a social comment.\" </p> <p>And an expensive one at that. To take out a band costs somewhere in the region of \u00a350,000, including material costs, specialist workers, music, transport and the band's running costs. Each chooses a socially and personally significant theme (this year, South Connections Band's theme is Canboulay, a story representing regeneration), then produces around 300 costumes to fit it. </p> <p>\"I know the social situation has changed,\" Price says, \"but it is still very important to the masqueraders to be in the carnival, looking magnificent, making these statements.\" </p> <p>Like Ghetto Fabulous chic, these costumes demand acknowledgement from onlookers and the emphasis is on positivity. As South Connections Band leader Avion Mookram says simply: \"To dress up for the carnival is an expression of cultural pride.\" </p> <p>Rarely has the term \"fashion statement\" been so applicable or literal. Price believes the impact is felt throughout the city, with the success of the carnival increasing the prominence of London's Caribbean community. To see the wondrous costumes drift down Portobello Road, watched by revelling non-black teenagers, dressed to the hilt in rapper style or with dreadlocks and hemp trousers, creates a strange juxtaposition: one shows the proud assertion of cultural pride, the other the adoption into the (white) mainstream of a particular social group's fashion. Both, though, demonstrate the cultural and global diversity that was, after all, the point of the carnival in the first place. </p> <p>But this is all getting very serious. Let's not forget the true point of the carnival: to have fun. As Price says: \"The only real way to take part in the carnival is to be in it and have all of the feeling of being transformed.\" A statement that could easily apply to the masqueraders and spectators alike. Power dressing indeed.</p>",

  "Away from the joyful chaos of Bilbao's annual street festival, opponents in Spain's terrorist agony are quietly deciding if the summer of blood will become a long war. <p>Four bomb blasts before dawn yesterday in the neighbouring towns of San Sebastian and Irun damaged shops, offices and trucks. It was further proof that the Basque separatist group Eta has found a rhythm which appears to be speeding up. </p> <p>Stalked by assassins, members of the government in Madrid want moderate Basque nationalists to stop talking to Eta and settle for a military solution. Negotiation is no longer an option, they says. </p> <p>Widely vilified for hesitating, the moderates are on the verge of abandoning Eta, and with it the likelihood of another ceasefire. </p> <p>The Basque region encompasses 100 miles of mountain scenery and industrial affluence between the Pyrenees and the northern coast of Spain. It has considerable autonomy from Madrid, more than any other region in Europe, but not enough for Eta, which has killed 11 people since ending its 14-month truce in December after stillborn peace talks. </p> <p>Optimists think a golden opportunity can be clawed back through all-party talks; others think this is the start of another 30 years of exploding cars and bullets. </p> <p>More than 800 people have already died. In silent vigils throughout the country, Spaniards have rallied to the government's vow to resist terrorist pressure. </p> <p>\"Not a centimetre,\"the prime minister, Jose Maria Aznar, said - meaning the political ground he is willing to cede to Eta for a lasting peace. </p> <p>In a Bilbao park two Eta men, Efren and Garikoitz, smiled and shook their heads. Speaking Basque through a translator, they said \"the organisation\" was waging a legitimate struggle for a homeland, called Euskadi, for a people with its own language, culture and history. Madrid was centralist and anti-democratic, they said. </p> <p>\"I don't feel Spanish at all. The only thing I am is Basque,\" Efren said. \"I don't have any quarrel with Spanish people, only the Spanish state.\" </p> <p>\"Madrid is not interested in peace. Its only objective is to keep control. Every time Aznar appears on TV talking about crushing us, he thinks that'll get him some votes.\" </p> <p>Efren's journalism degree course was interrupted by five years in prison for being a member of Eta, which stands for Euskadi and freedom. \"They tortured me - beatings, electrodes, a plastic bag over my head. Some friends got sick and died, no one helped them.\" </p> <p>Like many comrades, he was sent far away, to Seville to serve his sentence. \"It's unconstitutional, but they do it to punish the families,\" he said. </p> <p>Efren is a second-generation Basque from Portugalete, a town 10 miles outside Bilbao which attracts migrants from the rest of Spain. </p> <p>Garikoitz, 32, said the four Eta men who blew themselves up this month in Bilbao were freedom fighters. An architect's assistant, he said there was no shortage of recruits - a view confirmed by an interior ministry official. Garikoitz's sister is serving time in Paris for Eta membership. </p> <p>\"We do not feel free,\" he said. \"It's not just a state of mind, it's a reality.\" </p> <p>Security sources suggest that one reason the group ended the truce was to prevent a slide into political atrophy. Its motto is \"Actions unite, words divide.\" </p> <p>Another explanation is strategic. \"It may be that Eta is paving the way for a second truce in more advantageous conditions than the first,\" said Ramon Cotarelo, a political scientist. </p> <p>The police estimate that Eta's gunmen and bombers number less than 300,and that they rely on a network of passive and active support. In the region's last election, one in six voted for Eta's political wing, Euskal Herritarrok, formerly known as Herri Batasuna. </p> <p>Pedestrians in the prosperous Bilbao suburb of Getxo condemn the violence but blame Madrid for the ceasefire's collapse. </p> <p>The conflict was war, not a terror campaign, they said. </p> <p>\"Spanish people accuse us of not doing enough against Eta but Basques didn't start this. We shouldn't be policemen for the state,\" said a tattooed 22-year-old. \"I'm not going to vote against Euskal Herritarrok because I'm not going to vote at all.\" </p> <p>Eta banners flap freely on the main street in Balboa. Banks and mansions wear the scars of past firebombs, hurled to fulfil the group's anti-capitalist ideology. </p> <p>\"Kids here are well educated and well off but they join for emotional reasons, to be anti-establishment, to belong,\" said a pensioner, Juan Albeniz. </p> <p>While few in this region are willing to openly side with Madrid, Eta has its enemies. \"They are spoilt, murderous fascists,\" said Consuela Ordonez, 40, whose brother Gregorio, a councillor in San Sebastian, was shot dead. </p> <p>She said Madrid's refusal to negotiate had not sunk the ceasefire. \"The sole responsibility for the violence resuming is Eta's. They're a gang of fanatics. They hate society, they don't listen to people.\" </p> <p>Pessimistic about a resolution, she condemned the ambivalence of moderate Basque nationalists. \"Why don't they do more to stop the attacks? I don't understand.\" </p> <p>In addition to soldiers, police officers, businessmen and politicians, Eta's renewed campaign has been aimed at artists, intellectuals and journalists, including the columnist Jose Luis de la Calle, shot dead in May. </p> <p>Some writers may be intimidated into censoring their criticism, said Jose Manuel Alonso, a director of the newspaper El Mundo. Others may not. \"We don't want to be heroes, but we have a responsibility to do our jobs,\" he said. </p> <p>Eta called a ceasefire after the moderate Basque Nationalist party (PNV), which governs the region, moved closer to self-determination. The return to murder has strained that alliance, but Madrid wants it completely ruptured to isolate the militants. </p> <p>Critics accuse the mainstream media of slavishly backing Madrid's wishes, rather than encouraging the PNV to repair the alliance in the hope of wooing Eta back from the gun. </p> <p>\"This is a crucial phase. The PNV is coming under massive pressure to renounce the militants. If it does, it's a disaster, we're back to square one,\" said Gorka Espiau, of Elkarri, a non-partisan peace group. </p> <p>This morning, hundreds of youths in balaclavas will assemble at the town hall to cheer the raising of the Basque flag as part of the city's annual festival. </p> <p>When the Spanish flag is also raised stones and petrol bombs will fly through the air and a riot will ensue. While Efren and Garikoitz have outgrown such frivolity, they thought they might go along to watch their successors warming up.</p>",
  "<p>The future of the politically sensitive Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast is to be decided next week by its Norwegian owners who admitted yesterday that it faced \"a very serious situation\". </p> <p>The yard, which built the Titanic, has been hit by a \u00a323m setback from an American client refusing to pay its bill. Its 1,000 employees have already run out of work. </p> <p>There is speculation that the yard might be temporarily closed to save money while the company attempts to firm up potential orders for four ferries and two cruise ships. </p> <p>The owner, Fred Olsen Energy, said it was desperately trying to solve the problem and expected to make a final decision after the weekend. </p> <p>Ole Jortz, finance director at the Oslo-stock-listed group, said: \"This is obviously a very serious situation and it is being discussed every day. We are doing our utmost to find a solution but we are not magicians.\" </p> <p>He was speaking after a board meeting yesterday in Oslo which was inconclusive. The company later released a statement to the stock exchange which blamed the US rig operator Global Marine for the crisis. </p> <p>The yard lost a high court action two weeks ago which allowed Global Marine to remove a drillship completed by the yard but without a final instalment being paid. </p> <p>Global Marine is blaming cost overruns on Harland and Wolff while the Belfast company accuses the rig owner of making changes to the design which increased the price. </p> <p>The dispute has gone to arbitration but this could take many years to resolve. A judge disappointed Harland and Wolff management by agreeing that, pending a final outcome, Global Marine could remove the vessel from the yard. </p> <p>Fred Olsen Energy, owned partly by the Fred Olsen family which also controls Timex, is forking out \u00a32.5m a month to keep the yard running without work. </p> <p>The company won a potential \u00a3300m contract from a ferry company and signed a \u00a3200m agreement with a cruise shipowner but these two potential lifesavers have yet to be turned into firm deals. </p> <p>This could be hard to do as some shipping experts are sceptical about the seriousness of the companies behind these potential deals. </p> <p>The company planning the ferry contracts, for instance, was only formed in May and so far has been unwilling to reveal who its financial backers are. </p> <p>Harland and Wolff itself has also talked about its prospects bidding for Ministry of Defence contracts but these also remain highly competitive affairs. And its history with MoD ships has been chequered. </p> <p>Union officials in Belfast are steeled for the worst, anticipating another round of job losses at the least.</p>",
  "<p>Business leaders yesterday cast doubt on the chancellor's ability to deliver the scale of public spending increases promised last month but suggested his failure to do so might be a blessing in disguise. </p> <p>The Confederation of British Industry said bureaucratic delays and a lack of spare capacity in the building industry could thwart Gordon Brown's efforts to inject an additional \u00a343bn into key services over the next three years. </p> <p>However, it said this would help to keep the lid on infla tion and rates at a time when there was still a danger of excess demand leading to overheating in the economy. </p> <p>Publishing its latest quarterly economic forecast, the CBI said its best guess was that inflation would be on target this year and next - despite growth being above the UK's historic trend. </p> <p>Sudhir Junankar, the CBI's associate director of economics, said: \"Next year the main uncertainties for growth and inflation will be whether the chancellor's spending plans will be fully achieved, whether wages remain under control in a tight labour market and what happens to sterling. Although the risks to growth are fairly even these uncertainties could push underlying inflation above our 2.4% forecast by the end of 2001.\" </p> <p>Like the City, the CBI is concerned that unless consumer spending slows soon to make room for the extra demand created by higher public spending, the Bank of England could be forced to raise rates again from 6% to damp down inflationary pressure. </p> <p>But Kate Barker, the CBI's chief economic adviser, said the \"leads and lags\" in getting the spending plans through Whitehall could delay imple mentation. \"There's a lot of uncertainty in this new planning environment. It's not clear how departments will react to it,\" she said. </p> <p>Under the new system government departments plan their spending over three years rather than one, tying the cash to the achievement of targets for service delivery. </p> <p>Labour's second spending review, published in July, included a sharp rise in capital expenditure from 0.3% of gross domestic product in 1999-2000 to 1.8% by 2003-04. </p> <p>However, ministers are still sitting on unspent cash from previous Treasury allocations. In June it emerged that capital expenditure by the state was down 50% compared with figures during the Conservatives last year in power. </p> <p>A Treasury spokesman yesterday said departments would publish clear investment strategies in the autumn showing how they would meet their public service targets. </p> <p>The CBI forecast that output would grow 3.1% this year and 2.7% next and that, based on rates being held at 6%, underlying inflation would average 2.3% and 2.4% respectively. Meanwhile, unemployment is predicted to fall to 1.41m by the end of next year.</p>",
  "The government is to shake up its flagship \"fresh start\" scheme for failing schools with a support package including cash injections worth up to \u00a3400,000 each over two years. <p>One fresh start school, Fir Vale, in Sheffield, is to use an extra \u00a3200,000 a year over two years to give staff a 5% loyalty bonus. It will be the first time teachers have been given extra money for teaching in a challenging state school. </p> <p>David Blunkett, the education secretary, plans a major restructuring of the scheme as four more primary and five more secondary schools join in September, bringing the total up to 25. He conceded there had been problems in the past and said some might still fail. </p> <p>\"We must make sure that what we do is genuinely a fresh start, not what we cobbled together in the past,\" he said. </p> <p>In the \"refreshment\", head teachers of fresh start schools will establish a more direct relationship with the Department for Education as the role of local councils is prescribed and diminished. </p> <p>Details emerged yesterday of a meeting at the department in June between the existing 16 fresh start head teachers and senior officials, including Michael Barber, head of the standards and effectiveness unit, and Peter Clark, the former acting head of the Ridings school in Halifax. In their first joint meeting, the head teachers called for extra funding and help with the recruitment and retention of staff. The heads are establishing a network to spread best practice. </p> <p>Yesterday Mr Blunkett visited Fir Vale, which borders his constituency, as pupils received their GCSE results. Seventeen per cent of pupils there won at least five A-Cs at GCSE compared with 11% last year. </p> <p>The bonus scheme has Mr Blunkett's blessing. In April he said he was prepared to consider giving fresh start staff guarantees of future employment. Yesterday he said Fir Vale, under the leadership of Hugh Howe, its fifth head in five years, could be a \"model\" fresh start school. </p> <p>Details of the bonus package are still being worked out but it is likely teachers there will receive their bonus in two instalments, in December and May. </p> <p>Mr Howe said the school's success meant that its teachers were able to win promotion elsewhere. \"Those teachers have been in school two years and they met the challenging environment, contributing to the success we have had. They have been attracting other schools.\" </p> <p>Under the fresh start scheme, launched two years ago, failing schools were relaunched with new names, new headteachers, new staff and a new action plan. </p> <p>An extra \u00a360m for city academies and fresh start schools was earmarked in this year's Budget. Mr Blunkett has been keep to ensure that some of the money gets directly to headteachers. The amount will vary depending on the size and type of school and will be linked to performance targets. </p> <p>The fresh start initiative was rocked in March when three \"superheads\" quit fresh start schools in five days. </p> <p>Mr Blunkett said: \"I don't pretend it's the sole answer in every community for every school. If it fails, we should be big enough to put our hands up and say it has. But for many of the communities and the kids that attend those schools, its the last chance.\"</p>",
  "Key figures from the developing world gave their agreement yesterday to proposals for securing a voice in international economic forums. <p>The meeting, in London, was the first for the coordinating group of the G77, which represents 80% of the world's population. </p> <p>The group is angry at the way the developing world has been excluded from decisions taken by such organisations as the Group of Seven, which represents the wealthiest countries. </p> <p>The two-day meeting was the most serious attempt by the developing world to acquire political muscle since the Non-Aligned Movement lost influence. </p> <p>The main people involve were the president of Nigeria, Olusegun Obasanjo; the president of Malaysia, Mahathir Mohamad; the president of Algeria, Abdelaziz Bouteflika; the prime minister of Jamaica, James Patterson; and Cheryl Carolus, the South African high commissioner in London, representing President Thabo Mbeki. </p> <p>They issued a statement expressing concern about globalisation, trade barriers biased against developing countries, the environment, and debt. The statement reinforced the necessity of becoming effectively organised. </p> <p>A source close to the discussions said: \"They are concerned about decisions taken by the rich club and then they have to pick up the tab.\" </p> <p>The group of 77, which was originally 77 countries but was expanded to 133, has been largely moribund through lack of organisation. I </p> <p>It carries little weight with the G7, the World Trade Organisation and the International Monetary Fund. </p> <p>More than 120 of its members attended a meeting in Havana in April to look at ways of gaining more than a toehold at meetings of the rich club. </p> <p>Aware that they have been hampered in the past by the unwieldyness of an organisation with so many members, they agreed that a small coordinating group should meet in London. </p> <p>The group is to be put on a permanent footing, and may be chaired by the former Commonwealth secretary-general, Sonny Ramphal, who attended the London talks. </p> <p>The source said: \"The problem in the past was that it was an amorphous group. They want a tight group to do business.\" </p> <p>The G77 is less political than the Non-Aligned Movement and more focused on influencing the big international economic bodies. </p> <p>The source added: \"They want informal influence at the WTO and IMF rather than long speeches at the UN.\" </p> <p>The leaders were privately infuriated that Mr Mbeki, a member of the core group though he was absent from the London meeting, was virtually ignored when he attended the G7 meeting in Okinawa last month. </p> <p>The London meeting, held at the Nigerian residence, was organised by Mr Obasanjo, who is emerging as one of the leaders of the developing world. President Clinton, in recognition of Mr Obasanjo's growing importance, is to visit Nigeria tomorrow. </p> <p>As a first test of their political strength, the members agreed to present a special report to the UN millennium summit in New York next month. The report, which will not be published until seen by all G77 leaders, deals mainly with trade and the environment. </p> <p>The coordinating group met the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, at Downing Street before leaving London. Mr Prescott said that the developed countries had to do more to meet the anti-pollution targets agreed at the Kyoto conference. </p> <p>Mr Prescott, in separate talks, thanked Mr Obasanjo for his intervention in Liberia over the arrest and imprisonment of a Channel 4 television crew.</p>",
  "Zenon Cruz bites another coca leaf from its stem, tongues it into the wad already bulging in his cheek and scowls up at the army helicopter hovering above the jungle canopy. \"My father sowed coca and his father sowed it before him,\" mutters the peasant farmer, his teeth stained green. \"What the Americans do not understand is that this leaf is a gift from mother earth to our people, an ancient tradition. They do not understand its sacredness. They think it is all about drugs.\" <p>Like the majority of campesinos gathered at this roadside protest in the tropical Chapare region of Bolivia, 29-year-old Cruz has watched a US-backed eradication squad hack away his entire crop and his main source of income. </p> <p>Last year alone, the soldiers destroyed a record 17,000 hectares in the region and by the end of this year aim to finish off the remaining 3,000, in a drive to strangle the US drugs problem at source. </p> <p>The Bolivian government, under huge funding incentives from the US (it must be seen to be meeting drug eradication targets to qualify for development aid), calls the strategy Operation Dignity. Cruz and his struggling fellow farmers call it cultural genocide. </p> <p>Andean peoples were using this hardy plant for a variety of ritual and health purposes for thousands of years before white men first learned to extract cocaine from it. Rich in vitamins and minerals, the leaves have traditionally been used to treat ailments ranging from dysentery to altitude sickness. The vast majority of Bolivians still chew them daily, mixing them with ash to create an anaesthetic effect on the stomach to ward off hunger. Death, marriage, and almost any other social or religious ritual here will include an offering of coca. </p> <p>\"Guard its leaves with love,\" warns Legend of Coca, the 800-year-old oral poem. \"And when you feel pain in your heart, hunger in your flesh and darkness in your mind, lift it to your mouth. You will find love for your pain, nourishment for your body and light for your mind.\" </p> <p>But the seers also foretold that white man would find a way to subvert their \"small but strong\" plant: \"If your oppressor arrives from the north, the white conqueror, the gold seeker, when he touches it he will find only poison for his body and madness for the mind.\" </p> <p>What the seers did not predict was the scale of the backlash. White man duly succeeded in extracting the 0.5% alkaloid cocaine from the coca leaf at the end of the 19th century - Dr Sigmund Freud become the first to contract nasal cancer from snorting it - and all hell broke loose. </p> <p>Eradication attempts first began in 1949 after a study by a North American banker, Howard Fonda, claimed that the chewing of the plant was \"responsible for mental deficiency and poverty in Andean countries\". Soon afterwards, in 1961, the United Nations placed coca on schedule one, branding it one of the most dangerous and restricted drugs. Of course, this had no effect on US cocaine use, as executives snorted lines while the ghettos opted for its cheaper and more dangerous relative, crack. By the 80s, more than half the world's cocaine was being consumed by the superpower, which has just 5% of the global population. Bolivia, one of the world's poorest nations, saw an opening in the market and filled it. It was to become the world's second largest producer of coca and cocaine paste. </p> <p>Now, under the concerted eradication first initiated by Ronald Reagan in his war on drugs, it is payback time. Bolivia is being punished for its recent complicity with the destruction of its ancient culture. </p> <p>Not without a fight, however. \"Go home Yankees!\" shouts a furious Quechua woman in a bright shawl and bowler hat, marching with hundreds of others under banners calling for farmers' human rights to be respected. The helicopter keeps its distance, and the DEA officials rarely show their faces outside the confines of the nearby army base. </p> <p>Zenon Cruz denies supplying the drug barons with his coca, but admits there were plenty who did. At the height of the trade, light aircraft landed regularly on these roads to pick up consignments. \"But they are punishing us all - legal and illegal together - and everyone is struggling,\" he says. </p> <p>Coca, a hardy plant ideally suited to tired or eroded soil, could produce three or four harvests a year. Now forced to grow beans and oranges instead, as part of a US-funded \"alternative development\" plan, Zenon must feed his family on a fraction of his former income. \"You can fill a lorry with oranges and not sell any of them at market, but coca always sells like hot bread,\" he says. \"I was making 150 bolivianos [about \u00a320] a week before they cut down the coca. Now we sometimes struggle to make 20 [\u00a33]. How can you feed a family on that?\" </p> <p>Other families still risk everything for a higher income. A few miles down the road, at the military base in Chimore, a 16-year-old local girl is being paraded before the press. Alcira Marin has just cracked after three days of interrogation and admitted to smuggling coca paste inside her body. The evidence lies in 40 pellets wrapped in yellowed clingfilm, on a table beside her. \"I was paid 300 bolivianos [\u00a340] to do it,\" she mumbles. \"I didn't know I would die if one broke inside me.\" Under the country's harsh and US-influenced Law 1008, she faces between five and eight years in prison. </p> <p>Later, in thick jungle barely 10 minutes walk from the main trunk road, Captain Luis Castro, of Bolivia's elite US-funded counter-narcotics police force, Umopar, shows me a cocaine pit his patrol have discovered this morning. In a six-metre polythene trough, heaps of fresh coca leaves lie half-trodden into greenish pulp, while older, browner leaves are piled a metre high at the edge of the jungle clearing. The workers, whoever they were, have disappeared, probably warned by two-way radio. \"Burn it!\" says Castro to his khaki-clad men, who begin scooping gasoline from a plastic separation tank hung between stakes. </p> <p>\"Judging by the amount of used coca here, I'd say they were working constantly for about three months,\" he tells me. Typically, eight men would stomp around this trough for 12 hours to turn more than 350kg of leaves, mixed with kerosene, into 1kg of pastabase, the crude paste from which cocaine must in turn be refined. Most would expect to earn up to \u00a33 an hour, which is certainly tempting when you compare it with \u00a33 a week for growing oranges. </p> <p>At an order from Castro, a man pulls the pin on an incendiary bomb and tosses it into the centre of the pit, sending flames and smoke billowing upwards towards the jungle canopy. \"We use their own gasoline to put them out of business,\" says Castro, whose cohorts have destroyed 275 similar pits in the first six months of this year alone. \"We're not going to lose to the drugs people.\" </p> <p>There is no doubt that the net is tightening, but the effect may simply be to drive up prices and encourage new markets elsewhere. Anti-drugs police estimate that the little more than three tons of pastabase will leave the Chapare this year, but this alone will generate some $4m, thanks to a 300% price increase over the last three years. Critics of the eradication policy argue that it will simply drive producers further into the Bolivian Amazon region, or elsewhere in South America where an estimated 2.5m square miles lie ripe for production. </p> <p>\"It's simply the law of supply and demand,\" says Kathryn Ledebur, co-ordinator of the Andean Information Network, a human rights watchdog publicising problems with the eradication effort. \"It's pointless trying to stop production in the producer countries - the place to fight it is where the market is.\" The bigger picture is indeed discouraging. While Bolivia has fallen from second to third largest cocaine exporter behind Colombia and Peru, there has been almost no reduction in the amount of cocaine exported to the US and Europe, according to the annual report of the International Narcotics Control Board. The explanation is that production has increased in Brazil and Colombia, where the governments have little control over their tropical territories. </p> <p>\"It's an obvious case of the balloon theory in operation,\" says Ledebur, who is an American. \"You squeeze it in one place and it'll just expand in another unless you tackle root demand. Instead we've got a war focused on the poor people, and it is not working.\" </p> <p>On a terraced hillside in the fertile Yungas valleys on the other side of the country, a small boy dressed in traditional poncho and woollen cap kneels to make his offering to Pachamama, or mother nature. As he unwraps a cloth full of coca leaves, lights an incense burner and sprinkles alcohol on the ground, other children come forward to sing in Quechua: </p> <p>Green coca, you are born of our land/Your fragrance makes us sing happily/In the fields among the mountains/My little coca leaf is sweet medicine/Not a drug that does damage/We suck your juices for help in our work. </p> <p>It is part celebration, part pre-emptive protest. The families of this region, the last remaining place of legal coca cultivation in Bolivia, know things could easily go the way of the Chapare for them. While Law 1008 currently provides for 12,000 hectares for traditional coca-growing and distribution in the Yungas, US officials have been arguing that less than half that is needed for chewing or ritual uses. \"There is evidence that Yungas coca is being diverted to the illicit market for conversion to cocaine products,\" says the latest US embassy report on counter-narcotics. Local people believe that if they give in now, the North Americans will simply carry on demanding more until nothing is left. </p> <p>Eradication was supposed to begin here later this year, until the country exploded in violent protests over the issue in April. Coca growers dynamited the only road into the region, and the eradicators backed off - until next year. A tense impasse continues, but nobody has any illusions that they will be back. </p> <p>\"The child in the US learns that he must buy things in order to be happy, whether it's Nike trainers or a gramme of cocaine,\" says Javier Castro, curator of the coca museum in La Paz. \"That's the root of the problem, and everyone knows if they can't get their drugs here, they will just go somewhere else. In the meantime, they want to wipe out coca completely - it's a kind of cultural genocide. It's going to be as if we have no soul, no spirit.\" </p> <p>Castro is one of many who have fought to have the coca leaf recognised as a potential health product rather than a schedule one drug. Western backpackers here drink coca tea constantly to ward off altitude sickness, and a Harvard University study found that 100g of Bolivian coca more than satisfied the recommended daily allowances of calcium, iron, phosphorus, vitamin A and riboflavin. </p> <p>Contrary to popular belief, the burst of energy it gives comes not from the 0.5 cocaine content - this is in fact destroyed by saliva in the digestive tract, which is why cocaine users must snort or inject - but from its conversion of carbohydrates into glucose, and its stimulation of the respiratory system. </p> <p>With at least 30 coca products already available in Bolivia, ranging from toothpaste to pick-me-up pastilles, campaigners argue that there is considerable potential for salvaging the livelihoods of many thousands of poor farmers by marketing the plant in the west. </p> <p>But the only company which has managed to get round the ban is the Stepan company of the US. In one of the howling ironies of the coca war, it legally imports 175,000 kilos of Chapare coca each year to manufacture, among other things, a de-cocainised flavouring for Coca-Cola.</p>",
  "Polly Toynbee's enthusiasm for \"my Europe right or wrong\" is usually just amusing but when it's coupled with the anti-Americanism of her claim that \"the more we look at alien America, the more European we feel\" it moves to a higher level of Euro-rubbish (Comment, August 23). <p>She shouldn't assume that her dismissal of American culture, politicians and values just because they're different to hers, is a majority view. Britain draws its popular and much of its elite culture from the US. Socialists and Thatcherites both look to US egalitarianism dynamics and freedoms. Investors are pouring money into its growing economy, perhaps because it has created 20m new jobs compared to almost none in Europe. </p> <p>In consumption, social change, economics, IT and education where America goes we follow, always provided Europe's elitist, bureaucratic regulatory obsessions allow us. Moreover, US problems of budget, surplus, prolonging growth, dealing with poverty and globalisation are also ours, though they're more energetic, inventive and dynamic in seeking solutions. We should learn from the US not dismiss it. </p> <p>No use criticising the Americans because they don't follow Polly Toynbee's prescriptions. Europe isn't either. Indeed they're of little interest to the real people who will be deciding the fate of Gore and Bush, though they at least are free to determine the way America goes, which is more than we are in the European Union. </p> <p>Austin Mitchell MP </p> <p>\u0095Polly Toynbee's worries about American dominance can only get worse. UN forecasts are that the population of the US will increase from 267m in 1995 to 349m in 2050 including immigration while the EU population (exclusive of the UK) drops from 314m in 1995 to 235m in 2050. </p> <p>Future labour force comparisons are even more lopsided in favour of the Anglo-Saxons because of the huge rise in EU pensioners. </p> <p>A Scholefield, UK Independence party </p> <p>\u0095It has been people \"looking to Jesus as their guiding influence\" that has played a large part in challenging successive British governments on global warming, defence, third world debt and poverty. </p> <p>Rev Kenneth G Walton, Clayton le Moors, Lancs</p>",
  "The protest planned for next month in Prague is not about looking for a fight with the police or trashing McDonald's, contrary to the impression given in your report (Riots threaten Prague autumn, August 24). Nor have previous similar demonstrations been \"riots\". I was in Seattle for the protest which shut down the World Trade Organisation meeting last November. It was an inspiring show of unity by trade unionists, students, peace activists, environmentalists, women's groups and pensioners against the WTO and its priorities. <p>Thousands are going to Prague because they believe people should come before profit. The IMF-World Bank policies of enforcing debt repayments cause the deaths of 19,000 children in the third world every day. The protests in Seattle, Washington, Millau, Los Angeles and the one to come in Prague are a sign of a rising mood against the cruelty, injustice and violence of the world system. </p> <p>Charlie Kimber, London </p> <p> </p> <p>\u0095Why are there \"fears\" of a huge protest at the IMF summit in Prague, rather than hopes? Why might it be the \"worst so far\", rather than the best? Does the Guardian's world view completely exclude the possibility of massive demonstrations against global capitalism being a good thing? </p> <p>Paul Deacon, Worthing, W Sussex </p> <p> </p> <p>\u0095We take strong issue with Oxfam's allegation that the debt relief package for Zambia under the HIPC initiative is a \"fraud\" (Debt relief leaving the poor worse off, says Oxfam, August 21). On the contrary, the initiative will reduce Zambia's external debt by 60-65%, and debt service payments in 2001 will be cut as a result of the initiative from nearly $600m to $225m. After 2001, Zambia's debt service payments are projected to drop sharply further, to reach single digits as a percentage of exports from 2005 on. </p> <p>It is true that, despite these efforts, debt service payments next year will be higher than this year, because of repayments to the IMF, which have been zero for a number of years. But this, of course, is not a proper basis for an assessment of the impact of HIPC. </p> <p>I would note, however, that the IMF is front-loading its HIPC assistance to Zambia, providing close to 60% of all HIPC initiative assistance in 2001-02. It is also looking for additional ways to reduce the burden. And in any event, Zambia will be receiving more money from the IMF than it will be repaying. </p> <p>Moreover, Oxfam is taking an unduly narrow view by ignoring the fact that grants and new concessional lending - on top of the HIPC initiative - are expected to provide an amount more than double Zambia's debt service in 2001. </p> <p>If they are used appropriately, these funds can start to reverse some of the deterioration in human development indicators cited by Oxfam, ensuring that the poor are better off. </p> <p>Ernesto Hernandez-Cata, International Monetary Fund </p>"
