  "<p>When the protesters start converging on the World Bank and International Monetary Fund meetings in Prague next week, Mark Malloch Brown will no doubt allow himself a sigh of relief. </p> <p>Until just over a year ago, his job as the public face of the bank would have put him directly in the firing line for what are expected to be the biggest rallies against globalisation since the protests which shook the World Trade Organisation talks in Seattle last December. </p> <p>Trying to justify the bank to people who believe babies are murdered in developing countries and environments destroyed in the organisation's name is no easy task, even for a man with as impressive a track record in the black arts of political spin doctoring as is Malloch Brown. </p> <p>Instead, he has swapped his post as head of external relations at the bank for the top job at the United Nations Development Programme, an organisation that most development campaigners regard as one of the good guys of the development aid world, although even its best friends would admit it has not always been the most effective outfit. </p> <p>He is clearly relishing his new role. \"It's so much more fun to run one's own development agency rather than apologising for the running of somebody else's,\" he says. Among his dreams are putting Africa online, reshaping his organisation as the main source of advice to developing countries and mediating in the debate which has split the development community over whether economic growth or redistribution of resources from rich to poor is more important in tackling global poverty. </p> <p><strong> 'Wing and a prayer'</strong><br> </p> <p> Malloch Brown admits the contrast between the bank and the UNDP was \"a bit daunting\" at first. The UNDP runs on a shoestring compared to resources available to the bank and the fund. Its core budget this year was $700m - less than what the bank spends on administration - although with the extra resources it mobilises the overall total rises to about $2.5bn. The bank's lending programme, by contrast, totals $7bn. </p> <p>\"It's all got there by a wing and a prayer,\" says Malloch Brown. In fact, the budget has been declining over the past decade from a peak in 1992 of $1.2bn. The UNDP has been a victim of the aid fatigue which hit the main donors after the collapse of the Iron Curtain removed the political justifications for many countries' lending programmes. </p> <p>But it has also been a victim of its own reputation for inefficiency and waste. Britain is one of the leading donors which has refused until recently to increase its allocation for the UNDP until it sees evidence that the money is being well spent. </p> <p>A British national with a long track record in the international system - he worked for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in the early 1980s - Malloch Brown came to the UNDP at the request of the UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, to shake up the place and be part of Annan's reforming agenda which was showcased at this week's millennium summit. </p> <p>But Malloch Brown was received initially with suspicion. Some poor countries believed he had been chosen to smuggle a bank perspective into an institution which has always been seen as an ally of the developing world. While the World Bank and IMF are under the thumb of the donor countries - the Group of Seven leading industrialised economies controls nearly half of the votes on the fund's management board - the UNDP has always been much closer to the recipients of aid. </p> <p>Malloch Brown freely admits he preaches the bank's line about the need to accompany aid with political and economic reform and he deliberately set out turn the UNDP's focus to the importance of good governance. It was a message not universally popular with aid recipients unaccustomed to receiving lectures on reform from their friends at the UNDP. </p> <p>\"In the first six months I had a bit of rough ride because I said governance ought to be our priority. There was a lot of initial caution, the developing country representatives in New York said 'oh my God, he's another part of this secret political version of the Washington consensus'.\" </p> <p>For some developing country governments the strings which come attached to aid programmes these days, requiring them to consult with their electorates, are seen as a new form of political structural adjustment. </p> <p>But the initial concern has dissipated, according to Malloch Brown, as poor countries have come to realise that they need to change. They would still rather hear the message from the UNDP, however, than endure the more heavy handed approach of the bank or the fund. </p> <p>Malloch Brown's belief in the importance of democratic reforms comes from his time at the UNHCR during the late 1970s, which convinced him that the root of all problems in developing countries was a lack of democracy. </p> <p>\"If you have a competitive political system in which to resolve differences, you won't have refugee flows,\" he says. </p> <p>It was also the spur behind the next stage of his varied career, his work as a political consultant for various developing country governments in the late 1980s and early 1990s. </p> <p>He describes himself then as a \"mercenary for democracy\", and he and his colleagues chalked up some impressive victories, including Corrie Aquino's election campaign in the Philippines in 1986 and the no vote in the Chilean referendum of 1988 which eventually ended General Pinochet's rule. </p> <p>The wave of fledgling democratic governments which came to power in the 1980s were ripe for advice from Malloch Brown's consultancy with its sophisticated polling techniques and understanding of political systems. He learnt a lot, as well, along the way. </p> <p>\"A lot of these nice phrases about local ownership in the development community I learnt at the political coalface.\" </p> <p><strong> 'In the wrong business'</strong><br> </p> <p> Malloch Brown sees his role at the UNDP as the culmination of his previous experience. The organisation clearly needs a PR overhaul to restore donors' confidence, but at the same time he has to go gently to avoid alienating the trust of the developing countries, which is its biggest asset. </p> <p>The old-style UNDP ran thousands of small development projects and had a reputation for being bureaucratic and inefficient. Malloch Brown thinks the project-based approach is a waste of time when its resources are dwarfed by other aid agencies. </p> <p>\"UNDP was in the wrong business, we didn't offer any value added,\" he says. \"In a tight market for official development assistance we were going nowhere.\" </p> <p>The plan now is to reposition the UNDP as an advisory and advocacy agency. That is not, he hastens to add, because advice is cheap, although that is an advantage, but because \"if you look at the environment in which we are operating, advice is a scarce commodity\". </p> <p>In fact, turning the UNDP into an advisory body will bring it once again into competition with the bank, which is also championing the governance agenda. His old boss, James Wolfensohn, has been trying to reposition his institution as the \"listening bank\". </p> <p>But in a head-to-head battle over who should be the prime source of advice to the developing world the UNDP has many advantages. </p> <p>While the bank is handicapped by the perception that it is in the pocket of the G7, the UNDP can capitalise on trust. \"I'm stunned by the freedom I have to raise issues with governments,\" says Malloch Brown. </p> <p>The backlash against globalisation which started in Seattle last December has also benefited the UNDP. \"The Seattle aftershocks which have driven the developing countries back to us made them more cautious and anxious to find an alternative path.\" </p> <p>Malloch Brown is no advocate of stopping the processes of economic integration, however. </p> <p>\"Globalisation is inevitable: the question is on what terms,\" he says. \"We have to make sure that poor people are included in the process.\"</p>",
  "Returning to the office after a summer holiday can have a back-to-school feel. You're still carrying around those Bonusprint envelopes on the off-chance that you'll find a new victim to inspire with your tales of trekking in Tanzania or chilling in Cornwall. <p>Thoughts may turn to a job which involves more travel, yet \"working in travel\" conjures up images of Michelle Collins in Sunburn: condemned to the challenges of pacifying punters who never stop whingeing about the cicadas keeping them awake at night. </p> <p>Real travel is much more National Geographic: a trusty Nikon, battered Rohan boots, swimming with turtles - doing the world in your own inimitable style. But is it possible to combine real travel with work? </p> <p>\"The adventure travel companies are always looking for good people,\" says Lyn Hughes, editor of <a href=\"http://www.wanderlust.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">Wanderlust magazine</a>. \"It's not a well-paid profession, but it's a fun profession. You've got to be able to drink and have a sense of humour.\" And if that's beginning to sound a bit Club Med, Lyn is quick to point out: \"Whether it's Thomson or Abercrombie and Kent, you've got to be able to give people a good time. </p> <p>Indeed, in the blurb sent out by<a href=\"http://www.thomson-holidays.com\" target=\"_NEW\"> Thomson Holidays</a> to would-be reps, applicants are warned: \"Making sure all our customers have a great holiday is no holiday.\" </p> <p>Yet surely working for a more upmarket operation would offer myriad opportunities for creative globetrotting? </p> <p>\"If you're a Thomson rep, you're going to be advising people on which karaoke bar to go to; with an adventure company, you might be running out of petrol when you're 80 miles from the next town. But you'll always get people whingeing about their rooms,\" Ms Hughes says bleakly. </p> <p>It all seems to fall short on glamour. What is more, it's rather like the teacher who climbs the rungs of the educational ladder and ends up spending less time in the classroom; in travel, once you start to work your way up, you're likely to find yourself spending less time on the Silk Route and more on the Central Line. </p> <p>Having spent time \"in the field\", as it were, many people become much more office-based. Isn't it difficult to toe the line? \"I'm quite happy to be here for a while because it's a very dynamic environment. And I like it because I'm dealing with people I know in Latin America from my days as a tour leader,\" explains Liz Tremlett, who works in sales and operations at Journey Latin America. She keeps her hand in by doing the odd escorted trip, the next one being the Hummingbird: a taster of Brazil, Paraguay, Bolivia and Peru in 22 days. </p> <p>With a degree in Latin American studies, working for Journey Latin America is almost a vocation, Ms Tremlett feels. </p> <p>\"Once you get the language you can make massive inroads into understanding the culture. I just like the way things work. It's relaxed, I like the way that people deal with you: they're much more affectionate, it's much warmer.\" This warmth even extends to the working environment back in London, she says. </p> <p>\"It's a company where a lot of people share your passion for Latin America so there are quite a few office romances. And in the field, says Lyn Hughes, there's even more scope for romantic encounters: \"You get all that: 'Let's put up that tent together.' 'Let's light that fire together'.\" </p> <p>Someone whose tent-erecting experience led her to her husband is Linda Hearn. After meeting at Canvas Holidays they set up Inntravel in 1984. Short breaks, walking, cycling and painting holidays are particularly attractive to the empty nesters, explains Linda, who believes that the opportunity now for tour operators is: \"To give added value and added service: the things that customers can't organise on their own. That's the challenge.\" </p> <p>Indeed, a recent survey carried out by Wanderlust magazine reveals that only 11% of readers use a high street travel agent, with 39% booking flights and accommodation direct through the internet while the rest are using specialist tour operators. </p> <p>But is there life after even the most up-market repping? </p> <p>\"We feel we've now got a structure where people have got a little bit of a career path. If you get to be a product manager then you do get to travel a lot,\" says Linda Hearn. \"But one thing about working in the travel industry is that you end up doing a lot of travelling and not a lot of staying put. For years our kids thought that a holiday was going around checking hotel bedrooms, but then they realised that some of their friends went to a beach in Spain for two weeks and didn't look at anybody else's bedrooms\". </p> <p>Checking bedrooms, bars and restaurants is also part of the job description for Neal Bedford, travel writer for <a href=\"http://www.lonelyplanet.com\" target=\"_NEW\">Lonely Planet</a>. In an environment where the publishing manager Katharine Leck gets 10 to 15 approaches from aspiring Lonely Planet writers each week, Neal got his foot in the door via the post-room route. </p> <p>\"I walked into the offices in September 98 and said: 'I'll do anything.' They said: 'If you want to pack some books, we've got a job for you'. </p> <p>\"Originally I wanted to get into cartography. I thought that writing was an untouchable job. But after eight months I did a sample chapter on Docklands. They liked it in the office and that's how I got into it.\" </p> <p>Mr Bedford can spend up to three weeks travelling and then three weeks writing. Since he started in March, he's been to Extremadura in Spain and the next stop is Vienna - he's busy now until Christmas. But all the Lonely Planet writers are employed on a freelance basis. </p> <p>\"We pay a fee and on top of that we pay a daily expenses rate is how it works,\" according to Katharine Leck. </p> <p>\"And you're given a huge style manual and you have to learn that pretty much off by heart,\" explains Mr Bedford. \"Lonely Planet likes you to put a bit of yourself into the book.\" </p> <p>Travel writing, and putting a bit of yourself in the book, has always been up there on the dream job list and you can even learn how it's done. At the <a href=\"http://www.arvonfoundation.org\" target=\"_NEW\">Arvon Foundation</a>, where tutors include the likes of William Dalrymple, the travel writing courses are immensely popular and are consistently over-subscribed. </p> <p>\"I suppose there's a lot more freedom in this industry,\" says Mr Bedford, who is actually a trained accountant. \"Although I wouldn't say that this is a particularly secure job. You do it because you've got a passion for travelling.\" </p> <p>Yet anyone else dreaming of doing a shimmy from accountancy into travel would do well to heed the warning of Lyn Hughes: \"An awful lot of people go on wonderful trips and come back and say they want to do something in travel. But you've got to like people, not just places.\" </p> <p>Simon Heyes works at Last Frontiers, a company which specialises in tailor-made holidays in South America. </p> <p>\"I'm very happy where I am at the moment. There are four of us and we all do pretty much the same job: we all run the business right the way through and we do a hell of a lot of travelling. </p> <p>\"Since I started working in travel the market has expanded massively. There's an awful lot more affluence around: people with disposable income who want to get a little bit off the beaten track and who don't mind spending \u00a37,000-\u00a38,000 for two people. </p> <p>\"Where the travelling comes in is zipping off as much as we can to see new places. It's all about finding new haciendas and estancias and the only way you can do that is to actually go there. We know about 95% of everything we sell, which I think is pretty unusual. </p> <p>\"Friends think my job sounds absolutely amazing but I've probably become quite blase about it. It's a lifestyle I've got quite used to, although if it ever did stop it would probably be quite a shock.\" </p> <p>Sandra Winnick is volunteer programme manager at <a href=\"http://www.earthwatch.org\" target=\"_NEW\">Earthwatch</a>, an international charity which promotes sustainable conservation by supporting scientific field research and education. Members of the public can work as volunteers alongside field scientists and prices range from \u00a365 for two days to \u00a32,800 for six weeks. </p> <p>\"I used to work for STA Travel but I decided around two years ago that I wanted to move into the charitable sector. Earthwatch wanted someone who was concerned about the actual mission but who also had commercial experience and an understanding of the travel industry. </p> <p>\"I suppose that my job is travel with a difference. We send people all over the world; it's very much like booking a special type of holiday. </p> <p>\"I joined the Spanish dolphins project in July. Two scientists near Almeria have been trying to gather enough data to supply the Ministry of Environment with sufficient information to set up marine protected areas. </p> <p>\"You're on a boat - a refurbished Norwegian fishing vessel - and there's a roster, so you have a go at every activity from putting up the sails to going up to the crow's nest to watch for dolphins. It's quite an unusual way of spending your holiday time but more and more people are looking for something different. </p> <p>\"Over the past few years, people who started with package tours moved on to the tailor-made idea and now some people are saying: 'I've had enough of that, I want to try something different'. With Earthwatch, sometimes you're going into rainforests not normally open to tourists, so it really offers a very different experience.\"</p>",
  "<p>British Airways is to push for a transatlantic partnership with Northwest Airlines of the US as part of its \u00a33.1bn merger with Dutch rival KLM, in a move likely to shake up the global web of airline alliances. </p> <p>BA's decision to press for a Northwest alliance effectively jettisons its efforts to seek a closer tie-up with American Airlines, Northwest's US rival. </p> <p>The BA recommendation is due to be put to the board early next week by senior company executives, the Guardian has learned, in an effort to clear away one of the main barriers to a full merger with KLM. The move will leave a question mark over the Oneworld alliance led by American which includes BA. </p> <p>A deal with KLM could still be called off at any time as financial details of the merger have still not been agreed months after talks began. </p> <p>However, Rod Eddington, BA chief executive, is understood to have decided that the company's best chance of winning regulatory approval in the US for further landing slots would come from trying to take over KLM's established partnership with Northwest. </p> <p>Next week's board meeting comes a fortnight before the next round of talks in London on the open skies agreement between the US and British governments. </p> <p>Trade negotiators believe that BA will have to offer concessions on its landing slots at Heathrow, Britain's busiest airport, to gain regulatory approval for KLM's pact to be carried over. US regulators have voiced concern about any attempt by BA to gain a stronger foothold in the US market \"by the back door\". </p> <p>KLM gained immunity from competition investigations into its alliance with Northwest some time ago. </p> <p>BA's previous attempts to negotiate a closer relationship with American, which would effectively mean more flights between Britain and the US, had been stalled by US demands that more Heathrow slots were opened up. </p> <p>As well as deciding that regulators may be more inclined to agree a Northwest alliance, senior executives at BA are understood to have decided that the cost of trying to extricate the company from KLM's arrangement with Northwest would be too onerous. </p> <p>Someone with knowledge of the talks said yesterday: \"Northwest did a brilliant deal with KLM and they will do the same with BA.\" </p> <p>BA refused to comment on the details of the talks with KLM yesterday. A spokesman said: \"KLM has agreements with Northwest which are an important part of their business and as part of our discussions with them we are looking at how this might fit in.\" </p> <p>He warned that \"while progress is continuing, we don't have an agreement in place\". </p> <p>BA's decision to plump for Northwest adds a further twist to a transatlantic merry-go-round of partnerships complicated by a fresh round of takeover talks this summer. </p> <p>In recent weeks, industry analysts have speculated that American, the second largest airline in the US, may be looking to join other global alliances such as the Qualiflyer group led by Swissair.</p>",
  "Japan was shaken by its biggest spy scandal in 20 years and Moscow exposed to public embarrassment when police seized a senior Japanese officer yesterday on suspicion of leaking confidential documents to a Russian military attache suspected of working for his country's secret service. <p>The unexpected flashback to the cold war prompted an angry exchange of accusations between Tokyo and Moscow, just three days after the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, ended his first official visit to Tokyo by rejecting Japanese claims to four disputed islands. </p> <p>With that in mind, Japan's choice of this moment to swoop on the naval officer and a Russian diplomatic contact may not be entirely coincidental. Their relationship had been monitored for some time, according to the authorities. </p> <p>Police said that they caught Shigehiro Hagisaki, 38, who worked as a researcher at the national institute for defence studies and held the rank of lieutenant-commander, as he was passing secret papers to a Russian military attache in a restaurant in Tokyo. </p> <p>According to the state-owned television channel NHK, the attache, Victor Bogatenkov, 44, is a member of the GRU, the intelligence service which replaced the KGB after the disintegration of the Soviet Union. Mr Bogatenkov has claimed diplomatic immunity from questioning and arrest. </p> <p>Detectives are reported to have watched the two men exchange envelopes at about 10 meetings in the past year at Chinese restaurants and at bars. Mr Hagisaki is said by the authorities to have admitted supplying information in return for money. </p> <p>The extent of the leak remains unclear. Mr Hagisaki worked in the documents division of Japan's navy, known as the maritime self-defence forces because the country's post-war constitution restricts it from formally having offensive military capabilities. </p> <p>He is believed to have had access to sensitive information about his country's submarine forces and about security cooperation with other states. </p> <p>Embarrassingly for the government, police allege that in searches of the suspect's house and office they found files on the US navy. Washington is Tokyo's main ally. </p> <p>\"This incident invites mis trust about Japan's defence arrangments both at home and overseas,\" said Hidenao Nakagawa, the government's main spokesman. </p> <p>The defence minister, Toshio Torashima, said the accused officer's actions were \"unforgiveable\" and said a complaint would be lodged with Russia once the details of the case were clarified. </p> <p>But in Moscow a government spokesman took a pugnacious tone, calling the arrest unfriendly and provocative. \"Japan, unfortunately, has forces that want to turn the clock backwards because they are unhappy at the radical improvement in bilateral relations,\" said an official quoted by the news agency Itar-Tass. </p> <p>Tokyo and Moscow have yet to sign a peace treaty more than 55 years after the end of the second world war because of a sovereignty dispute over the Kurile islands to the north of Japan that were seized by Soviet troops in 1945. </p> <p>Three years ago, when relations were warming, the two countries's leaders pledged to work towards settling this problem by the end of 2000. </p> <p>Earlier this week, however, Mr Putin turned down a compromise by the Japanese prime minister, Yoshiro Mori, who suggested Moscow could cede administrative control in return for agreed sovereignty. This rejection killed off any chance of agreement by the end-of-year deadline. </p> <p>The two leaders parted with public smiles and promises to cooperate more on regional security, but the lack of progress was a huge disappointment for many in Japan.</p>",
  "\u0095 When the price of crude oil was $8 a barrel, some oil-producing countries were facing economic ruin. Did the west then point out that oil was too cheap (Clinton wins oil pledge, September 8)? If the cost of petrol is too high - even though it is almost equivalent to that of bottled water - it is the public, brought up in a car culture, that bears the consequences and short-sighted governments that in the past two decades have undermined public transport, while making money from car usage, who are to blame. Many years ago, the Swiss voted in a referendum to increase the price of petrol. Their educated decision was based on environmental consciousness and access to good, cheap public transport.

  "<p>Mitsubishi Motors was forced yesterday to suffer fresh indignities to atone for its 20-year cover-up of vehicle defects with the resignation of its president and the ceding of boardroom influence at a bargain price to foreign partner, DaimlerChrysler. </p> <p>Adding to a day of woe for Japan's fourth biggest car manufacturer, the government filed criminal charges against the company for failing to report customer complaints in a systematic deception that the transport ministry described as \"extremely evil\". </p> <p>In an emotional press conference, Mitsubishi president Katsuhiko Kawasoe said he would resign to take responsibility for the scandal, which has forced the company to recall a million cars across the world. </p> <p>\"I offer my deepest apologies for the great trouble that we have caused our customers with this problem,\" said a red-eyed Mr Kawasoe who was heralded as \"Mr Clean\" when he took the post amid a pay-off scandal three years ago. </p> <p>Although he will be replaced by another Mitsubishi executive, vice-president Takashi Sonobe, the biggest change announced yesterday was the allocation of a boardroom seat for DaimlerChrysler. </p> <p>The world's fifth biggest car maker is in the process of taking a 34% stake in Mitsubishi, but the scandal has allowed it to do so on far more favourable terms. DaimlerChrysler said it has negotiated a 10% discount in the price of the shares it is buying, which will now go for $1.9bn (\u00a31.3bn) rather than the initially agreed $2.1bn. It has the option to buy the company outright in three years. </p> <p>This may not be necessary.

  "<p>You've seen them in the magazines, those homes - sorry living spaces - that exude a Zen-like calm. You've imagined what it must be like to wake in a bed of pure white linen with wafts of translucent silk moving at the window in the morning breeze. You've imagined what it must be like returning from a stressful day at the office to a room so peaceful you can forego the stiff gin and simply sit and breathe. You've imagined all this, but it is so far from the reality of your home - cluttered with the accessories, noise and bustle of modern life - that you have dismissed it as you would a dream. </p> <p>Not so fast. Okay, you have to use your home as an office, a kid's play centre, a storage depot and a motel, so a collection of sculpted aromatherapy candles in the centre of the sitting room is an impractical idea, but peace and harmony can still be yours. Honest. </p> <p>How to achieve this blissful state? It depends who you talk to, but the consensus among the house doctors is that it all comes down to colour and storage systems. You could have guessed storage would come up - sensible, unarguably good for us but dull, dull, dull, the world of interiors' equivalent of fibre and regular exercise. But colour, now that's exciting. </p> <p>We all associate colour with mood - red is the colour of sexuality and excitement, while blue is cool and reflective - but there are many who take this further, who claim that colour has the power to improve (and presumably damage) our sense of well-being. </p> <p>Colour therapy is not new. The ancient Egyptians had coloured rooms in their temples for treating and healing, but it is now re-emerging as a popular alternative practice and there are people, such as interior designer Catherine Cumming, who are starting to apply the principles of colour therapy to interior decoration. </p> <p>In her book, The Colour Healing Home (published next month by Mitchell Beazley, priced \u00a316.99), Cumming argues that it is possible to lift the \"energy\" around us and enhance our spirits simply through a bit of well-considered decoration. \"Colour therapists,\" she says, \"heal people by shining a coloured light on to them. Coloured pigment is less powerful, but once you start opening to it, the effect is astounding.\" </p> <p>Such therapy works on the premise that each colour has its own energy and that we absorb this through our light-sensitive cells. The aim is to create a balance and a free-flow of this energy. Obviously, no two people respond to colour in the same way, so this is a highly subjective practice, but there are some general rules. The most calming colours are the cool ones - blues, greens and violets - so the theory is that if we are aiming for peace and tranquillity we should eschew those fabulous hot red walls (far too energising for a stressed-out soul) and stick to the more gentle side of the spectrum. </p> <p>\"Violet,\" explains Cumming, \"is a tranquil colour that promotes inspiration and contemplation. Green is a balancing colour, neither hot nor cold, and is particularly effective in the city, where there are few green fields, but blue is the most calming of all. Being in a blue environment makes you breathe out and really slows you down. It is a perfect colour for bedrooms and promotes good, cosy dreams.\" </p> <p>So if we want to create that Zen-like haven, should we paint our house in blocks of blue, green and violet? No. \"Too much of a single colour,\" explains Cumming, \"can in fact have a negative effect. Too much deep blue, for example, can slow us down so much that it makes us melancholy [so that's where the term 'the blues' comes from], so all colours must be balanced by their complementary colour.\" This means that a violet room must contain some intellectually stimulating yellow, while a blue room needs a splash (just a splash mind, too much will lead to confusion rather than calm) of orange, the colour of joy and physical activity. </p> <p>Of course, for some people, the suggestion that a blue sitting room, nicely balanced by the odd orange scatter cushion, can make you feel more relaxed is just a lot of alternative mumbo-jumbo. Forget energy flows, they say, a room feels good because it looks good, whether it's painted a peaceful lilac, a stark, clinical white, or a deep red with lots of geometric patterns (another no-no, according to the colour therapists, who believe that patterns should be gentle and related to nature if they are going to aid relaxation). </p> <p>Tricia Guild, founder of the interiors company Designers Guild, is a great believer in the power of pigment, but she is no colour therapist. Her approach is more personal. As she writes in the introduction to her book White Hot: Cool Colours For Modern Living (published by Quadrille, priced \u00a325), \"my response to colour has always been intensely personal and emotional. Colour theory and scientific explanations are not my ways of searching - I prefer intuitive responses.\" </p> <p>So, although she agrees with Cumming that a retreat-like home should be primarily decorated in colours from the cool end of the spectrum (she is particularly fond of aquamarine, a shade that she says \"radiates the peaceful, calming qualities of a still sea\"), she still has room for punches of hot shades such as red and magenta. </p> <p>The secret of making these bold colours work as part of a calming colour scheme, argues Guild, is white, \"the classic colour of simplicity\", which not only functions as a cool colour in its own right but also, she says, \"gives other colours room to breathe, to stop competing, to be themselves\". </p> <p>And that's exactly what those of us who daydream over those magazine images of peaceful havens are looking for - a living environment that allows us the space to be ourselves. We may or may not believe that painting the room in shades of aqua and white will achieve this, but we have to decorate our homes in some way, and surely common sense tells us that a subtle, cool palette will be more conducive to relaxation than a riot of clashing, bright colours. We may or may not believe that painting a wall lilac will improve our self-esteem, but it's hard to argue with the idea that it's easier to think straight in a harmoniously decorated home free from clutter. </p> <p>No doubt there will be some readers who remain unconvinced, who say they can relax perfectly well amid the piles of books, media equipment and collectibles that fill their brilliant-red sitting rooms - but a change of colour has got to be worth a try for those of us who need help unwinding at the end of the day. At any rate, I find painting quite therapeutic.</p>",
  "<p>'I make the time,' declares Dr Demetrios Matsakis, 'so I can do what I want with it.' He's only slightly joking - if anyone runs the world's time, it's Dr Matsakis. He is Director of Time Standards at the US Navy's Directorate of Time - the hours, minutes and nanoseconds on the 60 atomic clocks at his laboratory in Washington DC provide the official source of time for the Department of Defense (and therefore the network of Global Positioning Satellites) and the standard of time for the US. He is the world's top time lord. And, today he's in the time centre of Britain - and no, it's not Greenwich. </p> <p>It's been many years since Greenwich really made the time. If you want to find the clock capital of Britain now, you have go to Teddington, Middlesex, to the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), where Dr John Laverty and his team of eight scientists check the three caesium clocks that send out the national radio time signal from Rugby. NPL's signal is used by government and companies such as Railtrack (all station clocks in Britain are timed with NPL, 'although we can't make the trains run on time,' says Dr Laverty). </p> <p>Under international agreement, world time actually comes together at S\u00e8vres, just south-west of Paris, at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM). There, an average is taken from 200 atomic clocks in labs around the world. Each month, a report is sent back to the time labs such as NPL or Washington to let them know how close their clocks are to the average. 'If I'm 10 nanoseconds out, we have a problem,' says Dr Matsakis. However, as his lab provides 60 atomic clocks - approximately 40% of the world total compared with the UK's 3 or 4% - he can, of course, set the average. Why does it matter? GPS [Global Positioning Systems] satellites, for instance, are time-coordinated - and if one is even a nanosecond out, you could miss by feet. </p> <p>It's certainly a weird career area. 'I was a real child of the space age,' says 50-year-old Dr Matsakis, who grew up with one eye peering through a telescope at the stars and has just been voted vice-chair of the prestigious International Astronomical Union's commission on time. </p> <p>They get together every few months at time conventions to write equations on the back of napkins and discuss projects, such as 'redefining the second'. This is important because the world is not as exact as the atomic clock, and often moves faster or slower - at present, every so often 'leap seconds' are inserted into the year. </p> <p>'The thing about time,' says Dr Laverty, at 36, a relative newcomer, 'is that everyone is so young - even when they're close to retirement'. They each have their own pet projects. For Dr Matsakis, it's 'finding the best way to average all clocks. It's the holy grail of time.' </p> <p>NPL is now a 'GOCO' centre in the jargon of Whitehall, ie, Government Owned, Contractor Operated. The time has officially been privatised. But ask Dr Matsakis if the US Navy would sell off the time and he is adamant. 'No way,' he says. 'They need the time. Things have to work. If there's a war on they don't need some peacenik not giving them the time... ' Are they ever late? 'My personal timekeeping is pretty awful, actually,' Dr Laverty admits.</p>",
  "<p>Internet time: it's confusing, complicated and heading our way. The theory goes like this: if the internet is a global community, how can you coordinate what's going on? Financial transactions, gambling or live webcasts would be a lot simpler if everyone around the world knew what hour it was without having to work out time zones. For the most part this is a question of convenience; in the business world, millions of pounds could be won or lost in a mix-up over an electronic time-stamp. </p> <p>'Speed is the form of ecstasy the technical revolution has bestowed on man,' said Czech novelist Milan Kundera, and the phrase 'internet time' used to mean simply doing things really fast, without business plans and on the hoof - five-year forecasts telescoped to six months. But, just like John Harrison's struggles over longitude, there is no standard, yet. </p> <p>The Brits have tried. Tony Blair launched a high-profile scheme in January to make Greenwich the focus of internet time. Greenwich Electronic Time (GET) consists of three atomic clocks in a warehouse opposite the Dome. </p> <p>PC manufacturers are offered free software to tell time accurately to within a fraction of a second, but there are reports the package doesn't work properly with Microsoft's Internet Explorer, used by 80% of the world's net users - one test found times differing by nine seconds. But it may succeed yet, and you can find out more at <a href=\"http://www.get-time.org\">www.get-time.org</a>. </p> <p>The Swiss watch makers, Swatch, have invented another solution - adopted already by US-based websites such as Apple and CNN. Swatch Internet Time divides the day into 1,000 beats - with one beat equivalent to one minute 26.4 seconds. Noon is 500 beats, and a day in Internet Time starts at midnight in Biel, Switzerland, where Swatch is based. </p> <p>You can do a conversion at <a href=\"http://www.swatch.com/internettime\">www.swatch.com/internettime</a> and see how elegant it would be to meet your beloved at 857 beats. It is totally impossible to understand, of course. </p> <p>But if you want to feel at ease with the earth, try the hippy-ish <a href=\"http://newearthtime.net/\">New Earth Time</a> where the day is divided into 360 degrees (just like the turning of the earth, see?). In net-land, there are 360 earthbeats every day, 15 earthbeats in an hour and one earthbeat every four minutes. </p> <p>It's complex, unreliable and understood by only a few. In other words, perfectly suited for the internet-age.</p>",
  "<p>It's early Sunday morning in SoHo, and downtown New York is beginning to wake up. On the wooden benches in front of Jean Claude's, a restaurant so rough-hewn and thoroughly French that it might have been airlifted from Aix-en-Provence, bleary-eyed punters are sifting lazily through the mammoth New York Times. </p> <p>Turning down Prince Street, Tan Dun, China's best-known contemporary composer, looks every inch the archetypal SoHo inhabitant. Despite just stepping off a long flight from Beijing, he looks rested and relaxed, ambling along in sandals with abrown paper bag tucked under his arm: \"Not many Asian artists really love or even experience this kind of environment,\" he says, pointing out various \"hot\" galleries hidden behind the postindustrial facades of the buildings. \"Of all of my generation who moved to the States, I am the only person really working and living in New York as a normal New Yorker. I don't have any distance with the local people here. The culture is my culture. This is my home...\" </p> <p>Yet Tan Dun's origins couldn't lie further away from this modish corner of Manhattan. Over breakfast in his minimalist white-on-white apartment, he slips a cassette into the VCR, a documentary account for Chinese TV of his recent research trip to Hunan, the rural district of China where he was born and spent his early life. </p> <p>In the opening shot, framed against a lake and a traditional Chinese wooden pavilion, he announces: \"The most important thing in our lives is always to keep thinking about where we came from. Only then will we know where we are going.\" He goes on to detail a childhood immersed in the \"shamanism and magic\" of a rural village, an adolescence toiling in the rice fields during Mao's Cultural Revolution and a musical background so suffused with Chinese folk values that until the age of 20 he had \"never heard uttered the names of Beethoven, Mozart or Bach\". The camera pans across jagged, mist-enshrouded mountains. It cuts to a lavishly costumed Taoist ceremony performed by octogenarian monks. The monks play \"sheng\" mouth organs, elaborate bamboo instruments that issue a dank, sweet whine, and \"po\" hand cymbals, which work up a delightful clatter. The finale is the \"feast of 100 dishes\", in which every family in the village brings along a course, and on the screen Tan, now tipsy on home-made wine, sings comically with the local schoolgirl choir. </p> <p>Tan Dun's journey between these two contrasting worlds - Hunan Province and NY State, as far east and west as it is possible to travel culturally and spiritually - is perhaps one of the most extraordinary success stories in modern classical music. From what he says was a starting point of blissful ignorance of the international canon, Tan has now established himself as one of the most sought-after composers in the world. From entertaining peasants in the auditorium of the rice field, he has graduated to some of music's most prestigious venues: Lincoln Centre, Carnegie Hall, the Barbican. </p> <p>The same global cultural contrasts are evident in Tan Dun's remarkably diverse body of music, which Japanese composer Toru Takemitsu has described as \"violent as a burst of human blood, yet full of grace\". From Hunan comes the palette of sounds and timbres, the traditional Chinese instruments and the incantatory, contorted vocal techniques, employed to powerful effect in works such as the ritual opera Nine Songs. From urban New York we get the hip-hop rhythms, industrial guitars and samplers that propelled his hi-tech, thrash-aesthetic reinterpretation of Peony Pavilion, the classic 16th-century kunju opera. Hunan again provides the philosophical underpinnings, particularly the Taoist view of art as \"reverberations with the vital forces in nature\". Meanwhile, from the urban wellspring of New York comes the pure spirit of downtown experimentalism so evident in Soundshape and The Pink. \"What is very little heard in European or western music is the presence of sound as the voice of nature,\" commented John Cage, who was a huge influence on Tan's early US work. \"It is clear in the music of Tan Dun that sounds are central to the nature in which we live but to which we have too long not listened. In Tan Dun's music, the east and the west come together as our one home.\" </p> <p>Finally, from its sheer diversity, and the necessity of communicating to listeners perched on the very extremities of human civilization, comes Tan Dun's mass appeal. His Heaven Earth Mankind (Symphony 1997), commissioned for the Hong Kong handover, was made into a video for MTV. And his soundtrack for Ang Lee's Chinese-language film Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon - premiered at the 2000 Cannes Film Festival - has already shifted 200,000 copies in the east. </p> <p>His place on the global music stage is confirmed by the Tan Dun Festival which opens at the Barbican on September 28. Entitled Fire Crossing Water, it will feature UK premieres of his new work Water Passion as well as the score to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. </p> <p>However, the reaction to his work has been far from universally positive. Some Chinese composers have dismissed him as \"not serious\". The New York Times has printed scathing reviews, many of them by the music critic Bernard Holland, who has written: \"He is like the proverbial boy locked in a pastry shop, gorging indiscriminately on everything around him.\" Tan Dun responds: \"He says that I am always trying to mix wine and beer. I think he is crazy. Eventually we will all realise one day that there never were any boundaries, except those of man. All music is created by God.\"</p> <p> But Tan's moments of solemnity are usually immediately undermined by a mischievous streak: \"He's always been a spontaneously funny guy,\" says director Ang Lee, who has known him since the late 1980s. \"Whereas most of the other Asians in New York were generally quite shy and reserved, he could keep you entertained for hours singing some hilarious Hunan village song about how the farmer was feeling up the pigs and stroking their tits.\" He is also an excellent raconteur: \"Often you will find yourself going for lunch with Tan Dun,\" says Avril MacRory of the BBC, which co-commissioned his 2000 Today: A World Symphony for the Millennium, \"and returning at nine or 10 in the evening.\"</p> <p> However, Tan Dun's playful, imaginative ability to turn any situation into an entertaining anecdote has also earned him criticism. While his stories of shamanistic culture are voraciously devoured by those who have known him only in the west, many of his more cross-cultural acquaintances mutter about \"exaggeration\" and \"embellishment\". \"Tan Dun is a completely urban person,\" says Zhou Long, a fellow composer who has known him since his early days at the Beijing conservatory. \"He's not really from the village. He is from Changsha, the capital city of Hunan province. Sometimes, when you do promotion, you make stories. There is nothing wrong with that. If you are writing some biographical notes you can do that.\" </p> <p>There would seem to be a certain amount of evidence to support this view. One example might be the Chinese TV documentary, which was shot not in his home locality but deep in the countryside, a plane journey away. The actual village where Tan Dun spent some of his childhood has long since been swallowed up by the Changsha suburbs. Tan Dun's reaction to these assertions is both conciliatory and indignant: \"Perhaps they are right. Perhaps I am an urban person. I did spend some of of my time in the city. But anyone who says that I didn't also experience the culture of the countryside, then that is an insult to me and my background. They didn't come with me to live in a small village. They didn't come with me to be re-educated in the rice fields. How can they know how I lived my life?\" </p> <p>Tan Dun was born in 1957 in the central Chinese district of Hunan, the only son of Tan Xiang Qiu, a military officer in the People's Liberation Army, and Fang Qun Ying, then a doctor working in a Hunanese hospital. In the traditional manner, his first name, Dun, meaning \"shield\", comes last, though in the west he likes to be casually referred to as Tan. While his official publisher's biography - reproduced in most articles and interviews - cites the precise birthplace as the village of Si Mao, according to his father, Tan Dun was actually born in a military hospital on the outskirts of Changsha, now a rather grimy industrial regional capital of more than a million people. As was common Chinese practice for a busy working couple, his father and mother sent young Tan Dun off to live with his grandmother in the satellite village of Si Mao Chung, about 20 miles outside the city centre. </p> <p>Tan Dun recalls the environment in the village as \"very barbaric, very shamanistic, very mystic, very sacred, filled with traditional art forms, poetry and music... Like all the people of Hunan, the villagers were very secretive, very strange and completely devoted to their secret beliefs.\" It was this mystical environment, he says, that provided him with his first musical experiences, primarily through esoteric local rituals.</p> <p> \"From the local people, I started learning how to play Chinese folk instruments, bamboo flutes and the 'erhu' two-string fiddle. It was very natural. Music was simply part of life, in local kunju theatre or shamanistic ritual, mostly at weddings and funerals.\" </p> <p>When he returned to the city, at what he says was the age of nine, his musical education continued when a teacher presented him with an decrepit old violin: \"It only had three strings and as I had no money to replace it, I treated it like a three-stringed fiddle.\" By now, however, Mao's cultural revolution was getting into full swing and soon Tan Dun's parents were sent off to be re-educated in the countryside, his father by cleaning out the animal sheds on a farm, his mother to become what was known as a \"barefoot doctor\" among the peasants. At the age of 17, Tan Dun followed them to be re-educated in the rice fields of the Huangjin commune, about 50 miles outside Changsha. </p> <p>Ironically, Mao's policy - which, Deng Xiaoping later said, caused \"grave misfortunes\" for China - turned out to be a real re-education for Tan Dun, who had now fully formed in his mind the ambition of one day becoming a composer: \"In the daytime I would be planting rice in the fields for 10 hours, 12 hours,\" he recalls. \"But in the evening I would direct all farmers in a kind of rural orchestra using their cooking pots and whatever else they can use. We had no money so most of our instruments were pots, branches of trees, bits of bamboo. I began also to collect many, many folk songs.\" </p> <p>After two years of backbreaking work on the commune, by a macabre stroke of luck for Tan, the entire orchestra of the Changsha Peking Opera were drowned in a boating accident and officials were sent out to the communes to recruit trained musicians. He spent a year fiddling his way up through the ranks of the orchestra, then the death of Chairman Mao brought the cultural revolution to an abrupt halt. As traditional educational establishments opened once more, Tan Dun was among the 40,000 applicants for places at the Beijing conservatory, with 400 competing for just eight places on the composers' course. </p> <p>The entrance exam lasted a full week and covered everything from mathematics to Marxist theory to orchestration and harmony: \"I'd never been trained. I was little more than a farmer; I had never seen a piano or any of those fancy instruments. So I did everything according to my first instinct.\" On the final day came the aural: \"The examining professor asked me to play some Mozart,\" says Tan. \"And I said, 'Who is Mozart?' And he shook his head and said, 'Ohhhh my God!' And then he said, 'All right. Play some Bach.' And I said, 'What? Bach? I never heard of Bach.' And he said, 'What about Beethoven?' And I said, 'Sorry, I cannot. I am from Hunan; I don't know who Beethoven is.' So I suggested that I just improvise a little and he said, 'OK'. I took out my violin, which had only three strings on it, and I improvised for an hour. He was really shocked. Then there was a really big debate. And against every professor in the selection committee, he argued that I should be taken on the course.\" </p> <p>This last anecdote is a particular favourite, repeated in various forms in interviews. Sometimes he improvises on his three-stringed violin for two hours, often as long as three. On other occasions he is even more versatile: \"They asked me to sing,\" he told one publication, \"and I could sing 300 folk songs from Hunan, Szechuan, Tibet, all over. They accepted me because I was a little shaman.\" </p> <p>How much actual \"shamanism and magic\" really went on in the village where he grew up with his grandmother is far from clear: singer Chen Shi-Zheng, who also grew up in Changsha, contends that \"every grandmother there is a shaman\", but Tan's fellow Beijing conservatory students, some of whom grew up in neighbouring regions, cast doubt on this. Chinese shamanism is much more strongly associated with the north of China and Mongolia. </p> <p>His father, Tan Xiang Qiu, confirms that it was in the village that Tan Dun's love of music was ignited and divulges that his son would continually play the violin \"until the skin under his jaw was hard and callused\". But in Tan Xiang Qui's account, his son returned to the city at the age of six, not nine as Tan claims, and he also paints a picture of influences rather less traditional and shamanistic. </p> <p>According to Tan Xiang Qiu, far from being primitive or ignorant, his son's traditional formal musical education was quite advanced for provincial China at that time: by the age of 14 he had mastered Chinese notation and a little later travelled to Beijing to meet the com poser Hua Lu Bin, expressly for the purpose of studying western music. It is difficult to believe that this quest for western musical knowledge might not have included at least some mention of Mozart or Bach. </p> <p>As for the infamous audition at the Beijing conservatory, the examining professor, Li Xian, who would go on to become Tan Dun's mentor, recalls none of the events or details mentioned in the anecdote; not the questions about Beethoven or Bach, nor the three-stringed violin, nor the one- to three-hour session of traditional improvisation: \"Two hours? No, that would have been impossible,\" he says stiffly. \"Each student was allocated a specific amount of time for the tests. The maximum would have been about 20 minutes.\" </p> <p>While Tan Dun actually gave a rather lacklustre performance at a very straightforward audition, it was his sparkling piano trio, the evocatively entitled I Dreamt of Chairman Mao, based on traditional Hunanese folk music, that earned him his place at the conservatory. </p> <p>So, in September 1978, he packed his belongings - \"a bamboo pole over my shoulder,\" he says, \"one side wrapped up with my clothes, on the other side my scores\" - and left Changsha to join the composers' class. Almost immediately, Tan was marked out by the eccentricity of his musical vision: \"He always used influences in his music from his own daily life,\" remembers Li Xian. \"He would use in his music the voice of the stones, or something falling on the floor, or a cup being struck: noises normal people don't manage to use or even hear. If someone crushed a can of drink in order to put it in the trash can, he would replicate the action to hear the noise again. Then he would introduce that sound into his music.\" </p> <p>After a visit in 1979 to China by a Japanese troupe who used traditional Japanese instruments to make contemporary music, Tan Dun began applying the same principle to Chinese instruments and music. One of the fruits of this approach was his first symphony Li Sao, inspired by a fourth century BC melancholic poem. The piece, whose title translates as On Encountering Sorrow, featured traditional instruments and caused some controversy. His next major work, the string quartet Feng Ya Song, came second in Dresden's Weber Prize, making Tan Dun the first Chinese com poser to win an international prize since 1949. The Dresden victory had an immediate effect on Tan's career, propelling him to the forefront of the \"new wave\" of Chinese composers, but his music was denounced by the state in its renewed campaign against \"spiritual pollution\". </p> <p>Once the political storm had passed, Tan Dun made a request to continue his studies at Columbia, and permission was granted. So, in 1986, he took a flight from Beijing to New York and touched down in what would become his adopted homeland. \"I took the subway from the airport to Manhattan,\" he recalls, \"and I immediately understood that it wasn't at all the place I had imagined. I saw many people in the subway car, and they were all different colours. I asked myself, 'What country is this?' \" </p> <p>However, Tan soon tired of Columbia University. \"I immediately wanted to get away from the kind of depressing, bitter, atonal, selfish and superintellectual post-post-whatever music I was being forced to write there.\" Columbia soon reciprocally tired of him, and the professors there display a simmering animosity towards him that continues to this day: \"He was actually a very nice guy. He was a very good raconteur and I remember he was telling me stories from China that were perfectly human and very entertaining,\" says Columbia lecturer Mario Davidovsky. \"But he was at that point enormously involved in promoting himself and his career. And he was much more interested in that than anything that might have been going on at the university.\" </p> <p>As Columbia was only paying his fees, he had to earn money to live. \"I worked in restaurants and played my fiddle on the streets of Greenwich Village. That was my biggest classroom and in some way it was very close to my village in China, with its ritual music and its religion.\" </p> <p>At the first opportunity, he moved from the university dormitories into the basement of a brownstone in Chinatown, began to attend cutting-edge performance works and gradually became part of an artistic Greenwich Village set that included Steve Reich, Philip Glass and Meredith Monk. It was also about this time that Tan Dun first met John Cage and his music became, as he puts it, \"Cagealised\": \"Though I had been using incidental noises and found instruments since I was living in the village, of course I never thought of it as avant garde. But he was doing what I had done in the countryside 20 years previously.\" </p> <p>When Tan Dun decided that he wanted to launch himself into this world, he turned to his landlady, Mary Scherbatskoy, who had previously been a producer of dance. \"He just asked me casually one day if I'd like to produce an opera. And he showed me the score, and it was quite astonishing. But of course, being Chinese he wanted a cast of thousands. Eventually, I got him down to nine.\" The piece, Nine Songs, also based on Chinese poetry, used traditional ceramic Chinese instruments and opened with an extended sample of Tan Dun's shamanistic wailing. It was a sensation when performed at the Pace Downtown Theatre in May 1989. </p> <p>Tan Dun went on to produce a number of experimental performance-based and dance pieces: Soundshape in 1990 at the Guggenheim Museum, which included an entire village orchestra cast in ceramic, and The Pink in 1993, which included a cast of naked dancers playing instruments constructed entirely out of paper or cardboard. It was at the last of these, in which Tan Dun also performed as the naked conductor, that he first met his future wife, Jane Huang, then editor of a New York-based Chinese fashion magazine: \"After the show we all went to a bar . . . Immediately, he began paying me a lot of attention - I had a stomach upset and he went to the trouble of trying to get the waitress to get me some milk. Then suddenly, he said to me, 'Would you like to come to Tibet with me?' I didn't know what to say, I was absolutely shocked. I had completely misheard the question and thought he said to me, 'Would you like to come to bed with me?' But in fact we did end up going to Tibet very soon afterwards. We wanted to get married in the mountains. It was a very quick romance.\" Because of laws barring overseas Chinese from marrying in China, they had to settle for a tower-block register office in Hong Kong. They now have an two-year-old son, Ian. </p> <p>By this time, Tan Dun's reputation was beginning to cross over into the mainstream. An association with the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra was the catalyst for the Orchestral Theatre series, four instalments of experimental gimmickry (part II saw the audience join in with trance-like chanting) multimedia (part III was set against a newsreel ranging from the Beatles to Mao's revolution) and a full orchestral score. The Edinburgh Festival commissioned Tan Dun's phenomenal Marco Polo, which featured a \"postmodern\" libretto by New York Times music critic Paul Griffith in which Marco and Polo appear as two characters/singers representing the yin/yang, east/west boundaries of modern culture. </p> <p>\"I don't really have any great interest in the east and the west as a dialogue,\" Tan Dun says. \"What I am interested in is trying to find a single language and distinctive style that is made up of many, many cultures and that can reach from many different diverse cultures.\" It is ironic that, in pursuit of this goal, he feels he needs to play up the primitive aspects of his background to such a degree, though in fact, the emphasis of his biographical details probably says more about the need for modern composers to distinguish themselves as much in their press packs as in their work. </p> <p>However, Tan Dun will ultimately be judged not on his life story but on his music, and in this area he still has a great deal to offer: \"One of the things I like about pop music is its accessibility and power. There, music just becomes the art of dancing together, performing together. And I think that if you can find that same international communicable quality, and somehow combine it with a very distinct personality and a very local and a very, very inward point of view, then you can smash the world.\" </p> <p><strong> Life at a glance</strong></p> <p><strong> Born:</strong> August 8 1957, Changsha, Hunan, China. </p> <p><strong> Education:</strong> Beijing conservatory, 1978-85; Columbia University, 1986-89. </p> <p><strong> Married: </strong> Jane Huang, 1994 (one son, Ian, aged two years). </p> <p><strong> Operas: </strong> Nine Songs, 1989; Marco Polo, 1993-4; Peony Pavilion, 1998; Tea Opera, to be premiered in 2001. </p> <p><strong> Orchestral works:</strong> Li Sao, 1979; Feng Ya Song, 1983; On Taoism, 1985; Orchestral Theatre I-IV, 1990-1999; Death and Fire: Dialogue with Paul Klee,1992; Ghost Opera (with Kronos quartet), 1995; Heaven Earth Mankind (Symphony 1997), 1997; 2000 Today: A World Symphony for the New Millennium, 1999; Water Passion after St Matthew, 2000. </p> <p><strong> Experimental performance work: </strong> Soundshape, 1990; Silent Earth, 1991; Jo-Ha-Kyu, 1992; The Pink, 1993. </p> <p><strong> Awards: </strong> Weber Prize, second place, 1983; Suntory Prize, 1992; Grawemeyer Award, 1998.</p>",

After the new deal offer, it could grow to \u00a390m but no further. </p> <p>The fund invests in a portfolio of UK blue chip and smaller growth companies - with some success over five years where it emerged as the top trust in its class turning \u00a31,000 into \u00a32, 389 - although recently it has slipped with growth of 25.8% over the past year, just below the sector average. </p> <p>But the main interest lies in its structure which manages to avoid normal investment trust rules which demand that 85% of the income from shares is distributed to shareholders who are then taxed. </p> <p>Ivory &amp; Sime has created a trust where the public buys \"ordinary\" shares which have no income. The yield from the shares goes to the holders of \"fixed-rate annuity shares\". They are a fiendishly complicated piece of financial engineering, but as they are all held by parent company Friends Provident and not traded, investors do not need to understand them. These shares are used to boost the capital to make up for the lack of income. The end result is that by encashing ordinary shares on a regular basis, investors can have an income stream which the Inland Revenue will count as a capital gain. </p> <p>Provided the annual gain is below the capital gains tax exemption level - currently \u00a37,200 per person - the income is effectively tax free. </p> <p>Investors can select how much they want encashed between 0% and 10% a year - paid annually, quarterly or monthly - so the trust can generate long term growth. </p> <p>\"This decision can be changed at any time without charge or penalty,\" says Ivory &amp; Sime's Fiona Mackenzie. \"So you can decide to keep your capital intact if share prices fall or your need for income drops. Alternatively, you can sell in the market.\" </p> <p>Charges are a very low 0.55% a year with no entry or exit costs. Launch investors do not pay stamp duty. </p> <p>The one thing that can go wrong is that the underlying investments fail to grow. Those who continue to take their full income will find their investment shrinks. </p> <p>It will face competition from the new LeggMason Investors American Assets fund which promises \"outstanding growth potential and 8.25% income\" although neither is guaranteed. </p> <p>This investment trust will concentrate on US stocks with around half in blue chips listed in New York, around 15% in a portfolio of dollar denominated bonds with the balance in a portfolio of UK split level investment trusts. If the decline of the pound against the US currency continues, investors will make extra gains. </p> <p> On top of all this, the fund will be almost doubled through a bank loan deal. For each \u00a31 invested - the minimum is \u00a31,000 - the fund will invest a further 94p through this borrowing. </p> <p>There are a number of risks besides a reversal of the pound's current fortunes. A big interest rate increase could hit the bank loan; investing in split level investment trusts where many funds already invest in each other can be dangerous as a fall in one or two could have a house of cards effect; and the US stock market could go into reverse. </p> <p>Investors with no interest in income but who fear stock market volatility might take advice on the Manor Park UK Accelerated Growth Fund. </p> <p>This is a five year lockaway with a minimum \u00a35,000 investment which guarantees it will repay the original capital at the end of the period no matter what happens to share prices. In addition, it will pay out 120% of any gain in the FTSE 100 index of top UK companies. There is no limit on the growth - guaranteed by top rated financial institutions. </p> <p>Besides having to sign up for five years, the downside is that the fund ignores dividends which makes up a substantial part of long term growth. </p> <p>Investors going all out for growth with some risk could check out the new Aberdeen Global Champions unit trust, the latest entrant in a fast growing area where fund managers ignore geography or business sector to concentrate on \"big ideas\". </p> <p>Here the key themes are \"globalisation, innovation and communication.\" Aberdeen foresees a world where \"champions\" will \"not be constrained by geography, size, current business models, or traditional practices. They will excel on a world stage. They all benefit from new technology.\" </p> <p>But whether that remit is so wide as to include almost any growth stock in any market is open to debate. Aberdeen admits that too focused an investment theme would be shunned by unit buyers as too volatile. </p> <p>What is left will be a largely US oriented growth fund - whether it does any better than other American trusts remains to be seen. It charges a typical 1.5% annually but with a slightly lower than normal 4.25% upfront fee. The minimum investment is \u00a3500.</p>",
  "<p>I think I'm addicted to reading. On a long flight I'm such a word junkie that I end up reading all that small print on the back of the ticket about not carrying bombs on planes if you can avoid it (it's the Warsaw Convention, check it out next time.) </p> <p>And if I'm in the bath too long, it's only a matter of time before I start reading the labels on the back of the shampoo and bubble bath. And apart from learning the Finnish for \"hair care\" (it seems to be a country where they've mistaken a stutter for a language), you'll soon discover that almost everything that's in a plastic container in a bathroom is made of the same ingredients.</p> <p>They might claim to be unique, they might be revolutionary, they might be for entirely different markets and purposes, but you can bet your backside that, apart from the packaging, they're all more or less the same stuff. Take a look at your shampoo, shaving foam, bath lotion, bubble bath, even your minty-blue cool-gel toothpaste and among the main ingredients will be aqua (water), laureth sodium sulfate (stuff that foams up) and a whole list of other near-identical contents.</p> <p>This same sense of more or less the same products dressed up in different boxes may have occurred to the hundreds of thousands of students who, in the next couple of weeks, will be choosing their first bank account and might be struggling to find the differences.</p> <p>For the banks, this is a once-a-year chance to recruit customers who could stay with them for life. And by promising a few introductory offers now, the banks hope to acquire account holders who, in a few years, will be high-earning graduates.</p> <p>This is big business, as the current total for students in higher education has reached more than 1.75 million. So what are students being offered to lure them into a lifetime relationship?</p> <p>If you cut away the slightly embarrassing attempts to be hip in the packaging, the high street banks are almost all promising the same three things: a basic current account, an interest-free overdraft and a freebie (along the lines of a CD voucher). And considering the long-term benefit to the banks, I'm always surprised how modest these efforts are. Given that it's difficult to get young people excited about a bank account, you'd think that the free gifts could have been slightly more adventurous.</p> <p>For instance, Barclays offers \u00a340 worth of vouchers, NatWest promises a CD player or \u00a335 cash and HSBC will slip you \u00a350 or a young person's railcard, the level of birthday present teenagers might expect from a generous granny rather than a global financial organisation.</p> <p>It might not be particularly ethical, but if the banks got serious about bribing and offered free tickets to New York they could sign up a whole generation of students for the price of a few charter flights. So if the freebies aren't going to turn many heads, the interest-free overdraft limits could be the biggest attraction.</p> <p>These range between \u00a3500 and \u00a32,000, often with the higher limits only available to students after a couple of years. For first-years, Abbey National is offering \u00a31,000 in interest-free overdrafts, Bank of Scotland \u00a31,200, Barclays \u00a31,250, Lloyds TSB, \u00a31,500 and NatWest will negotiate individually. And in terms of what students need most - money - there are not going to be many better ways of borrowing.</p> <p>Using an interest-free overdraft is certainly preferable to another product on offer, the student credit card. In my own time at university, the campus bank manager handed me a \u00a350 cheque guarantee card as gingerly as if it were a loaded revolver with the safety catch off, so the idea of giving me a credit card would have killed him on the spot.</p> <p>But there are now customised cards, such as the Student Barclaycard, which takes no prisoners with interest at 19.4 APR. By the time students graduate it's estimated that almost a third will have credit card debts.</p> <p>There are other benefits on offer to students. Discounted insurance is available from banks including HSBC and the Royal Bank of Scotland, covering contents and travel - and since students often end up in the type of insecure accommodation favoured by burglars, it's well worth considering.</p> <p>And the advice available from banks shouldn't be overlooked. Student life is now synonymous with debt, and debt can be a very stressful and isolating experience, so specialist advice from a bank with a branch in or near university could be a very valuable service. And remember, as you're heading towards thousands of pounds of debt, don't spend those \u00a340 CD vouchers all at once.</p> <p>Email: <a href=\"mailto:coughlan_sean@hotmail.com\">coughlan_sean@hotmail.com</a></p>",
  "<p>If figures from the National Centre for Volunteering are to be believed, half the population of the UK - 22 million people of working age - volunteer. They contribute 88 million hours a week to education, homelessness, the environment and many other causes. </p> <p>'One of the strongest and most exciting current trends,' according to the NCV, 'is the number of companies backing their employees to volunteer.' This change, so that companies which used to give money now actively encourage staff to become involved, is partly explained, says the NCV, by the fact that the Government is encouraging business to become more involved in social problems and that companies are recognising the links between profitability and the wellbeing of their community. </p> <p>But the main reason is that 'there are clear benefits for the company and staff - especially in skills development, team-building, enhanced public image and self-confidence', says the NCV. </p> <p>Giving Time: Volunteering in the 21st Century, from the thinktank Demos and Community Service Volunteers (CSV), predicts that this trend will become part of corporate citizenship under the influenceof two pressures: attracting consumers and retaining staff. </p> <p>The report's author, Gavin Mensah-Coker, says: 'People will look not only at prices, quality of services and merchandise but at the company's social policies and practices. Consumers will have more information and will assert their power through spending habits.' The report goes on to say that employee volunteering will be carefully managed and controlled by companies in order to maximise the return on their investment. 'Analytical models will establish the links between community involvement schemes and the profit margin of the company involved.' </p> <p>On the benefits of volunteering for employee retention, Mensah-Coker says: 'With the \"pick and mix\" approach to career development replacing the \"job-for-life\" attitude, employers will have to work much harder to build employee loyalty. Part of that will be giving employees the opportunity to volunteer in company time without penalty, supporting the community in the ways that they choose.' </p> <p>This is already happening through organisations such as CSV. Among the 100,000 people who volunteer through CSV each year are around 4,000 employee volunteers working for 300 different companies. These volunteers generate 36,000 hours of community support. According to CSV's Liz Hover: 'CSV encourages and supports employers who wish to involve their staff as volunteers in the community. This can be either through the management of a project or by providing advice, support and training to companies wishing to run the project themselves.' </p> <p>One of CSV's highest-profile collaborations with business is its partnership with TXU Europe, formerly Eastern Group, the national energy provider. The 'Energy for Action' scheme offers TXU employees regular volunteer placements within their local community. </p> <p>Erol Burns, a finance manager with Eastern Energy, is a volunteer: 'The company lets employees give half a day a month to help a local organisation with CSV and the volunteer must match that with personal time. I joined the scheme just over a year ago and have been working with the Ipswich and East Suffolk branch of Headway, which looks after people with serious head injuries.' </p> <p>By organising and assisting in outdoor activities for patients at Ipswich hospital, Burns saves them the cost of a driver for day trips. 'The outings go extremely well. CSV provides a good support system and the training required. My advice to anyone thinking of volunteering is really just to have the right attitude: keep an open mind and don't be frightened to take on anything. At Headway there are full-time staff, which helps.' </p> <p>He says: 'It is very satisfying to put something into the community, a win-win situation for everyone. It is good for my personal development, seeing how some people have to struggle in their daily lives, as well as the struggle the charity has to make ends meet; and it's good for the company, giving them the opportunity to show their commitment to a wider audience. </p> <p>'I've made a lot of new friends. I go in every second Friday afternoon. I really look forward to it and I know they look forward to my visits - and that's a really lovely feeling.' </p> <p>But volunteering is not always plain sailing. 'There can be pitfalls,' says Burns. 'Employees can find it hard to keep the commitment going. Both the volunteer and the charity have to be flexible. Balancing the pressures between work and the charity isn't always easy, and it can sometimes be hard finding half a day. </p> <p>Yet despite the seeming rise in the number of schemes to encourage volun teering, either through workplace schemes or trying to reach individuals, many voluntary organisations still find it hard to attract volunteers. </p> <p>Mark Walker is development officer at the northern region office of the Alzheimer's Disease Society and a passionate advocate of volunteering. 'We are not sexy at all. We find it hard to attract volunteers because people tend to think that we only deal with dribbling old people smelling of wee. Apart from the fact that that simply isn't the case, you can volunteer without having to have any contact with people with dementia. We pride ourselves on the support we give and the opportunities we provide for personal development. And we offer a range of options, from being a listening ear for carers, providing office support, even decorating an office badly in need of a coat of paint.' </p> <p>For some volunteers, charities can offer the chance of changing careers and finding more fulfilling work. Says Walker: 'One of our volunteers who began on our helpline wanted a more compassionate job than she had at the Benefits Agency. She went on to work for us full time for two years and has now moved to another extremely good job in the voluntary sector.' </p> <p>\u0095 CSV: 020 7278 6601; NCV: 020 7520 8900 </p> <p><strong>How to become involved</strong></p> <p>The following involve giving time or skills to the community, in or out of company time, on a regular or occasional basis: </p> <p><strong> Team challenges</strong><br>These involve events where a group of employees tackle a community problem or task, while building teamworking skills. Increasingly this has become the popular choice of companies who want to strengthen teams but not to engage in overly physical team activities. </p> <p><strong> Development assignments </strong> <br>These have two very clear objectives: to complete a real project in a charity, and to develop the employee's individual skills, typically over 100 hours. </p> <p><strong>Secondments for transitions </strong> <br>At times of major career change or in preparation for retirement, for periods of three-to-24 months, the secondee joins the community organisation while remaining an employee of his or her firm. </p> <p><strong>Mentoring </strong> <br>A one-to-one basis for involvement, particularly popular in education, but also growing fast in the voluntary sector, often at senior management level. </p> <p><strong>Business on board </strong> <br>Volunteers serve as trustees on management committees of community organisations and not-for-profit bodies. </p> <p><strong>Other</strong> <br>Other ways to get involved include match-giving, where the employer matches employees' charitable contribution and participation in fundraising events.</p> <p>\u0095 Source: National Centre for Volunteering</p>",
  "<p>This week has certainly shown one thing: that the quality of Premiership defending has dropped. While Chelsea were throwing away a two-goal lead over Arsenal, Middlesbrough were letting Derby back from three down. And that after Spurs had recovered to beat Everton the night before. Let's be honest, it would not have happened in Serie A. </p> <p>Seven times this season top-flight clubs have let points slip after being two or three goals up; even Manchester United got in on the act at West Ham. And George Graham is spot on when he says there are not as many good defenders around. </p> <p>To my mind not enough want to do the ugly work the job's all about: throwing themselves in the way of shots and crosses, and not just nicking or jockeying but making full-blooded tackles. Too many seem to be looking for the ball when it breaks and thinking how they can start an attack. </p> <p>Whenever you talk to people in the game about centre-backs these days the first thing they ask is \"Can he bring the ball out?\" But that should not be the issue. </p> <p>Italy were the best team defensively in Euro 2000 and they were hardly pretty to watch. Alessandro Nesta and Fabio Cannavaro occasionally played a decent pass but more than anything they were blocking, tackling, scrambling things away and sprinting to close down. To a good defender a yard is a mile, and some here need reminding what it's about. </p> <p>Italy proved that despite the tightening up by referees there is still room for strong tackles and bravery. The change in the Premiership may be related to the number of foreign defenders, some of whom rely on interceptions and jockeying rather than the blood-and-guts stuff. </p> <p>But I also wonder whether it might be down to the environment the British lads are brought up in. There may be a slight comfort zone. Not everyone is like Stuart Pearce or Terry Butcher, who could have been paid \u00a320m a week in their mid-20s and would still have put their career at risk if there was a ball to be won. </p> <p>I must emphasise that I love flowing, attacking football and would hate the emphasis to be switched to defence. Nor do I think centre-halves should be cloggers. But I used to remind my defenders that they were paid to defend. I would tell them: \"Get hit in the face, get hit in the groin, wherever. But I don't want to see you get hit on the backside.\" </p> <p>That's why I regard Paul McGrath as the finest centre-half I worked with. People said Paul was a class act but his biggest strength for me at United and Aston Villa was that he was brave and he won the ball. I think he could have used the ball better but he made a centre-forward's job hard. </p> <p>There are not many around in his mould now. For my money Ugo Ehiogu and Martin Keown are the best defending centre-backs in the country, and Jaap Stam also reminds me of an old-fashioned English centre-half, adequate with the ball but a great destroyer. </p> <p> P eople such as they thrive on defending but I don't think it means a lot to many others. Even Sol Campbell never gives me the impression he really wants to put his body in front of shots. And in that respect the cupboard looks pretty bare for England in the future. Rio Ferdinand and Gareth Barry are not that type. </p> <p>It must be said that a defender's lot is harder now. The tempo is quicker, the accent is more on attack and the quality of forward is far better. Mental tiredness may be a problem. </p> <p>Of course defenders have not been helped by changes to the offside and back-pass laws either. Teams such as Arsenal used to squeeze up the park and anything over the top was turned back for the keeper to pick up. It is not so easy now. </p> <p>The 3-5-2 formation can also cause problems because several wing-backs are good coming forward and weak at the back. But the bottom line is that the quality of defending is deteriorating. </p> <p>I have felt for a while that England would struggle to hold teams out. And much as I love watching Nwankwo Kanu or Gianfranco Zola, it would be nice to see one or two homegrown players emerge determined to protect the goal with their life.</p>",
  "<p>Bill Clinton last night won a pledge from the world's biggest oil producer, Saudi Arabia, to halt the relentless rise in the price of crude which yesterday brought France to a halt and prompted fears of a global recession. </p> <p>As UK petrol firms responded to the 10-year-high in oil prices by putting up fuel prices by 2p a litre, crown prince Abdullah said Saudi Arabia would raise production by 700,000 barrels a day in an effort to ease pressure on the west. </p> <p>However, oil experts said the 3% increase in output would not be enough to bring crude oil prices to below $30 a barrel and motoring organisations warned that British drivers could soon expect to pay \u00a34 for a gallon of petrol. </p> <p>Speaking at the UN millennium summit in New York, President Clinton said he had put pressure on Saudi Arabia to take action ahead of Sunday's meeting of Opec - the 11-member oil producers' cartel. </p> <p>\"I told him I was very concerned that the price of oil is too high, not just for America but for the world,\" said Mr Clinton after his meeting with the crown prince. \"If it was to cause a recession in any part of the world that would hurt the oil producing countries.\" </p> <p>Large parts of France ran out of fuel yesterday as hauliers and farmers, more determined than ever to win big fuel tax cuts from the government, continued their four-day blockade of oil refineries and depots. </p> <p>Angry farmers, already active on most of the 120 blockades up and down the country, successfully blocked the entrance to the Channel tunnel with their tractors, triggering scuffles with British tourists. </p> <p>Around 50 British holidaymakers mounted a counter-blockade by blocking a lane being used by the authorities to allow French cars to trickle past the barricades, and threatened to cut off the main A16 motorway if they were not allowed to get through the blockade and go home. Under police escort, a convoy of British cars and coaches was eventually allowed through in the late afternoon. </p> <p>A British police sergeant, who was part of the convoy but asked not to be named, said: \"It seems we managed to outmanoeuvre them with a bit of British courage and some cunning. We played them at their own game and it worked. In the end it was quite a fun victory for all.\" </p> <p>Another convoy member, Frank Davidson, 49, said: \"This was as sweet a victory as Wellington over Napoleon at Waterloo. They didn't like it when we put up a fight.\" </p> <p>While talks resumed late in the afternoon between the French transport minister, Jean-Claude Gayssot, and the two main hauliers' federations, the government reiterated that it would go no further than the 15% tax cut, worth \u00a3100m, it offered on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the European commission threatened legal action if the free movement of goods within the EU was disrupted. </p> <p>As the protest spread, the hauliers, farmers, ambulance drivers and coach firms were joined by thousands of taxi drivers in massed \"go-slow\" processions that brought traffic to a halt in a dozen cities and caused motorway tailbacks. </p> <p>At least three regional airports reported they would be out of aviation fuel by this morning. Wholesalers at the main Rungis market outside Paris said supplies of fresh fruit and vegetable were beginning to be affected and 80% of the country's petrol stations were either dry, subject to rationing of \u00a315 per vehicle, or had been requisitioned for emergency service use only. </p> <p>In the financial markets yesterday, the price of a barrel of crude oil eased back from a peak of $34.50 to $33.91. However, dealers said that most of the Saudi production increase had been anticipated by the markets and that prices were not likely to fall markedly. </p> <p>They said Saudi Arabia was the key player in the crisis because it was the only Opec nation with the spare capacity to pump the extra oil needed to bring prices under control. But it can expect opposition from other Opec members who are enjoying extra revenues from the price surge from under $10 a barrel at the start of last year. </p> <p>Lawrence Eagles, oil analyst at the City firm GNI Securities, said a harsh winter could boost demand by an extra 500,000 barrels a day, pushing prices still higher.\"You can't rule out $40 a barrel if Opec aren't prepared to act,\" he said.</p>",
  "We have been here before. The high-level conferences, the firm commitments, the hand-wringing, the international agreements that promise the earth and deliver next to nothing - all have been part of the backdrop to the campaign for debt relief. Now there is a threat that the campaign for universal primary education could go the same way. <p>Today is international literacy day and there is plenty for the world community to do. Out of a global population of 6bn, 880m adults are illiterate, two thirds of them women, most of them in south Asia. The next generation of people that will be unable to read and write has already been born unless action is taken speedily to turn fine words into action. </p> <p>It is four months since the UN conference in Dakar that promised that every child would be inside a classroom by 2015 and the signs are not promising. In theory, the conference was a step forward, committing every country in the developing world to produce an action plan for education and pledging governments in the developed world to ensure that the plans would not go unimplemented for lack of cash - around $8bn (\u00a35.6bn) a year. </p> <p>The World Bank is now trying to put together a global initiative, but as is the way with global initiatives, this is taking time. And time for a child out of school in sub-Saharan Africa is a commodity that quickly loses its value. </p> <p>One of the reasons it is taking time is because of the attitude of some western governments, including Britain. The aid agency Oxfam called for a dedicated global action fund to ensure that the Dakar declaration did not go the way of the Jontien declaration of 1990, which called for universal education by 2000 but failed to marshal the necessary resources to turn the vision into reality. </p> <p>Britain's Clare Short is a strong opponent of earmarking special funds for education, arguing that the problem for developing countries is not a lack of finance but a lack of the proper policies. She believes calls for a fund are simply \"gesture politics\". </p> <p>Tony Blair, who has pledged that the government's \"education, education, education\" manifesto should apply to the whole world, failed to move the subject up the agenda of the Group of 7 at its meeting in Okinawa in July. Instead the G7 focussed on closing the digital divide between North and South: the gap in access to new technology between rich and poor countries. </p> <p>This is a worthwhile objective. One third of the world's population live in countries which have fewer telephone lines in total than Italy. Around 90% of telecommunications traffic takes place between rich countries, while 50% of the world's population have never made a phone call. As the knowledge economy takes root in the coming years, this lack of access will take a heavy toll and widen the divide still further. </p> <p>Bringing telephone lines and computers to poor countries sounds like an excellent idea - particularly to those hi-tech companies lobbying for wider access for their products - but it is putting the cart before the horse. A computer is not much use to a child who cannot read. </p> <p>Without determined international action these children, their families and their countries will be marginalised in poverty, probably irrevocably, and Fortress Europe will increasingly find it impossible to keep the most desperate individuals out. </p> <p>And all these figures underestimate the full extent of the literacy problem, perhaps by as much as half. They are based on school attendance figures, and ignore the problem of the numbers of children who leave school functionally illiterate. In Africa, where increasing numbers of children will be out of school unless there is emergency action by western institutions, a new generation of adult illiterates is set to create a dangerously marginalised section of society and fire the wars of deprivation like Sierra Leone's. </p> <p>Even in the industrialised world illiteracy is a problem, with almost a quarter of young adults in the US having difficulty reading all but the simplest of texts. In the developed as in the undeveloped world low literacy invariably means poverty and the spiralling problems of drugs, violence and insecurity which go with it.</p>",

  "<p>Swirling paisley prints, mirror work, bejewelled flip flops: there is no doubt that Indian-influenced fashion has been enjoying an extraordinary popularity for the past few seasons in the west. Leaving aside the pashmina palaver of two years ago, which was more of a fad than an interest in Indian fashion, it can be seen across the high streets and on celebrities. Gold detailing and fringed shawls have been repeated to the point of cliche. Madonna sported a bindi in her video for Frozen and even Boyzone have been spotted with decorative henna work adorning their bodies. Yet something is strikingly missing here. There is a complete dearth of prominent Indian fashion designers in the west. </p> <p>Part of the problem lies, ironically, with our established appreciation of Indian fashion: it has already arrived, albeit in derivative forms. Designers such as Stella McCartney, John Galliano, Matthew Williamson, Jade Jagger and Gaultier have long been experimenting with Indian-inspired fashion - to the point that Indian designers themselves might not have sufficient novelty to swerve the cameras of the international media away from the familiar faces of Galliano et al. </p> <p>So it is a shame that last month's first India Fashion Week provoked such a lukewarm response in its own country and has received relatively little attention overseas. </p> <p>Lamke India Fashion Week, held in New Delhi over six days, showed the collections of 33 Indian designers. It marked the first attempt by the recently formed Fashion Design Council of India (FDCI) to bring Indian designers to global prominence. Although fashion shows have been held in India for the past 15 years, they were genteel, quaintly old-fashioned affairs: a designer would show on his own and it was a glam evening, replete with cocktails. The fashion week was a long-overdue attempt to showcase the talents of as many Indian designers as possible and attract the attention of international buyers and media. </p> <p>The FDCI's attempts to sell the Indian fashion industry to the west were apparent throughout: designers were instructed to use western approaches in their designs, such as concentrating on ready to wear rather than couture; many showed a mix of eastern and western clothes; and some used western models, such as Jodie Kidd. </p> <p>Teething problems, though, were apparent. The Hindu, India's national newspaper, dubbed the affair \"a farce\", complaining that some shows did not begin on time. \"Many of the shows were running late and some of the designers had very short notice,\" concedes Gitanjali Kashyap, fashion designer and member of the FDCI. Jodie Kidd disagrees: \"I had a really great time in India. Now I'm just looking forward to going back again.\" </p> <p>The designers believe that the poor fashion industry infrastructure in India is the main obstacle to their attempts to break into western markets. \"India doesn't really have a retail system, so designers don't have any real back-up,\" says designer Rina Dhaka. </p> <p>Nina Patel, a designer for the eastern clothing company Red Blue Purple, based in London and Bombay, is pragmatic about the situation: \"There are just so many manufacturing problems in India. Buyers need to be able to fax through requests and know that samples will turn up on time. So no, at the moment India can't compete with London, Paris, New York and Milan, but it can with places like Hong Kong.\" </p> <p>Fellow designer Manoviraj Khosla points out the central irony of the Indian fashion industry: \"Lots of American and British stores source from India and have factories here, such as Nicole Farhi, French Connection and The Gap. Indian designers need to make their own labels, not just work in production for western companies.\" </p> <p>Many eastern designers are more than willing to accommodate their designs to western tastes and needs. Two months ago shopmahal.com, a British based website, was launched, targeting the non-Asian press. It allows visitors to learn about and buy all elements of Indian fashion, from food to clothes to health treatments. The website's PR officer, Vaishali Shah, explains: \"Six months ago we saw how all things Indian were really gaining momentum in Britain, and we wanted to take advantage of this. It's funny, two years ago I would not have worn a mirror choker or a bindi in this country because I would have thought they were 'too Indian'. Now it's trendy to wear them, especially with western clothing.\" </p> <p>Britain's links with India mean that this country might be the most fertile and accommodating ground for raising the profile of Indian designers. The current vogue for individuality and authenticity suggests a growing market for real Indian designs. Rina Dhaka's clothes, for example, have been worn by Naomi Campbell and Tara Palmer-Tomkinson, and the TV presenter Jayne Middlemiss is one of Nina Patel's most loyal clients. Part of the attraction of Lamke India Fashion Week for Jodie Kidd was to see the origins of the styles she has worn for western fashion designers. \"So many designers I've worked for have been influenced by designs from the east. So I have always really wanted to go there.\" </p> <p>Whether India can break into the stronghold of the four main fashion cities is another matter. Wealthier, more established fashion weeks - Brazil, Toronto, Hong Kong - have failed to do so. But for the moment, most of the Indian designers would just be happy with some western acknowledgement. \"I'm not angry at the west, it's just frustrating that they don't know anything about Indian fashion,\" says Gitanjali Kashyap. </p> <p>The former president of the fashion house Chloe, Mounir Moufarriage, the man who recruited Stella McCartney, announced this week that he has formed a partnership with Indian designer Ritu Beri, who also showed in the fashion week. He hopes to launch her first ready-to-wear collection in the US in early October. \"The quality is outstanding, far beyond what you would expect,\" he has said. \"I think we could see a lot more from India in the next three to five years.\"</p>",
  "France's fuel tax standoff escalated further yesterday as serious fissures began to appear in the ruling coalition and the European commission threatened legal action to maintain the free movement of goods. <p>With some 80 % of the country's petrol stations either empty, under tight rationing or reserved for the emergency services, taxi drivers became the latest group to join the campaign for fuel tax cuts, causing traffic chaos in more than a dozen cities with massed \"go-slow\" protests. </p> <p>Farmers declared there was no prospect of them withdrawing from the barricades they are helping road hauliers to man outside 125 oil refineries and fuel depots around France. </p> <p>Dodging riot police, several hundred farmers succeeded in blocking the entrance to the Channel tunnel at Calais late yesterday afternoon, leading to angry confrontations with motorists. The blockade was later temporarily lifted to allow furious British holidaymakers on to the shuttle. </p> <p>Other farmers drove tractors and trailers on to train tracks outside Strasbourg and Bordeaux, bringing high-speed TGVs in the east and west to a standstill for most of the day. </p> <p>Nantes, Nice and Rennes airports reported they had all but run out of aviation fuel, school meals went undelivered in the Vosges, emergency-only petrol stations went dry in Brittany, and police were called in to guard requisitioned pumps in Lyons. </p> <p>For the first time in the four-day blockade, the French capital began to feel the pinch. While surrounding fuel depots were largely kept open by armed riot police, Paris petrol stations began to run out of fuel, particularly diesel, in increasing numbers. </p> <p>Furious at the fuel tax cuts already offered to the road hauliers, the Green party, a minority member of the Socialist-led coalition, warned the prime minister, Lionel Jospin, that it would react \"forcefully\" if any more concessions were made to road users. </p> <p>\"I back the cabinet that I am a member of, but I want to remind everyone that I joined it on the understanding that we would work for clean air and for moving away from road to rail transport,\" said the environment minister, Dominique Voynet. </p> <p>She had demanded an urgent meeting with Mr Jospin and said the Greens \"were not in this government in order to do the exact opposite of what we were elected to do\". </p> <p>Mr Jospin said on Wednesday night there would be no further negotiations with the hauliers and the government's offer was final. </p> <p>In Brussels, the European commission sent a formal request to Paris \"concerning a possible obstacle to the free movement of goods\", spokesman Jonathan Todd said. France would be violating EU law if it did not ensure its frontiers and main routes were kept open to goods traffic, he said.</p>",
  "Bill Clinton's message to crown prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia was brief and to the point when they met yesterday. Unless the world's biggest oil producer shook some sense into the militant members of the Opec cartel, there was a risk of plunging the world economy into recession. <p>This week's Millennium Summit in New York has been the ideal time for some diplomatic arm-twisting, and the outgoing US president has taken full opportunity of the presence of 189 world leaders to spell out to the Saudis the consequences of turning up the heat on the big industrialised economies. </p> <p>With rising energy costs casting a shadow over Al Gore's election hopes, halting the relentless rise in the oil price to its highest level in 10 years has become a key policy objective in Washington. Nor did Mr Clinton need to look very far for a world leader to support him. Jacques Chirac was also at the United Nations summit to give a first-hand account of how France is grinding to a halt as a result of the protests at rising petrol prices. </p> <p>After years in the doldrums, Opec has now grabbed centre-stage once more. It is 27 years since the 11-nation cartel first came to public notice when its response to Israeli victories in the Yom Kippur war was to increase oil prices fivefold, triggering a period of stagflation - rising prices and lengthening dole queues - in the west. </p> <p>Over the past 18 months it has again been flexing its muscles, agreeing to curb production as world demand for oil rises. As motorists have found to their cost, the result has been a sharp increase in petrol prices at the pump. </p> <p>Prince Abdullah probably did not take much persuading at his meeting with Mr Clinton. The Saudis are well aware that a downturn in the west could cause a collapse in the oil price. Even so, they are likely to get some flak from other Opec members at the cartel's meeting in Vienna on Sunday, who say that the oil producers are being unfairly criticised for a problem caused by higher fuel taxes and refinery bottlenecks in the west. </p> <p>A chart on its website headed \"The rip-off race\" cheekily compares the prices of a barrel of oil, a barrel of Coca Cola and a barrel of Perrier water. Needless to say, it shows that oil is a bargain, though perhaps less thirst-quenching. </p> <p>Today, Opec has more muscle than ever before - at least in theory. Its share of worldwide production has increased from 36% to 41% over the last 10 years, and its share of proven reserves has increased from 67% to 78%. This trend, in the view of some analysts, is likely to continue. </p> <p>But Opec's ability to use this muscle is limited because its members - Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Venezuela - have divergent interests and its decisions have to be based on consensus. </p> <p>Oil-producing countries range from those which can barely produce enough for their own needs to those which are almost totally dependent on oil for their foreign exchange earnings. </p> <p><b> Dependent</b><br> </p> <p>The most dependent countries benefit from high prices but also need price stability. Drastic changes, up or down, hamper longer-term development and can mean re-drafting the national budget at short notice. Besides the Opec countries, Russia, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Yemen, Oman and Mexico fall into this category. </p> <p>Julian Lee, analyst at the London-based Centre for Global Energy Studies, said yesterday that Sunday's discussions will not be about whether a production increase is needed, but by how much. </p> <p>\"It is all but certain that the situation will trigger an increase of 500,000 barrels a day, which will be fairly generally accepted,\" he said. \"But Saudi Arabia will push for a bigger increase - because it sees this as being in its own long-term interests and those of Opec generally.\" </p> <p>The Saudis are well-placed to do this because they hold about two-thirds of Opec's spare capacity which is estimated at 3m barrels a day. The Saudis would to some extent be shielded from a fall in oil prices by revenue from their extra production. </p> <p>But other Opec countries - Algeria, Iran, Libya, Nigeria and Venezuela - would lose money as a result of lower prices because they have little spare capacity. </p> <p>Venezuela, which currently holds the presidency of Opec, is at the forefront of the reluctant faction. At 3.1m barrels a day it is Latin America's largest producer - but almost totally dependent on oil. Each $1 drop in oil prices costs it about $1bn (\u00a3665m) a year. </p> <p>Its charismatic president, Hugo Chavez, has called an Opec summit in Caracas for later this month, and argues that the real issue is not high prices, but fair prices. </p> <p>\"We understand that they [consumers] start to feel uneasy when crude oil prices reach $30 a barrel, but they can imagine how it must have been for us when it fell to $8,\" he said recently. </p> <p>Coming at a critical moment in the Middle East peace process and in the midst of an American presidential election campaign, the argument over oil prices has acquired a political dimension. </p> <p>The Americans have been shouting more loudly than usual, and the perception that this was motivated, at least in part, by the electoral needs of the Democrats caused some resentment. </p> <p>Since then, the issue has been further complicated by American efforts to drum up support for its proposals on the Israeli-Palestinian issue. On the thorny question of Jerusalem, the Arab governments generally view the US as oversympathetic towards Israel. This is not a particularly good moment for Arab governments to be seen kow-towing to the Americans. </p> <p>Any decision to increase production will also have a built-in assumption that existing supplies will continue unabated. But with low stockpiles around the world, consumers have no real cushion against disruption of supplies from less dependable sources such as Iraq, Nigeria, Colombia and Angola.</p>",
  "Gordon Brown's closest trade union ally has accused his fellow TUC leaders of playing a \"very dangerous game\" by backing Britain's early entry into the euro, and thereby risking losing a promised referendum that could be won by the government by holding it when the time was right. <p>In a move reflecting the chancellor's determination to control policy on the single currency, Bill Morris, leader of the transport union, said the euro enthusiasts, who include TUC general secretary John Monks, were \"running down the pound\" and \"preaching doom and gloom\". </p> <p>In an interview with the New Statesman magazine ahead of the TUC conference in Glasgow, Mr Morris insisted it should be the government that ought to \"lead the debate on the euro\", and he ridiculed claims that millions of British jobs could be lost by staying out of the single currency. </p> <p>The chancellor has appointed Mr Morris to the court of the Bank of England, and, as if to emphasise the closeness of his view to those of the chancellor's, Mr Morris also published a Mori opinion poll showing a 10% net increase in the proportion of those prepared to back entry by Britain if the five convergence tests stipulated by Mr Brown were met. </p> <p>Mr Morris's curtain raiser for the TUC euro debate next week - the chancellor will address the congress on Tuesday - was made as it emerged that Tony Blair has agreed to a formal structure of regular Downing Street meetings with the TUC for the first time since Labour returned to office. </p> <p>In a sign of warming relations after what Mr Monks described as a \"productive but patchy\" first three years, there will be an official quarterly meeting between the two sides, backed with exchanges of position papers and a joint secretariat. </p> <p>The arrangements, which supersede present ad hoc contacts, will also bring in other ministers when necessary, and follow moves for a more systematic relationship between the TUC and the trade and industry department under Stephen Byers. </p> <p>But Mr Blair is still resistant to pressure from the unions to establish any broader tripartite \"social partnership\", bringing together government, unions and employers, as is common throughout the rest of the EU. </p> <p>Although there are what Mr Monks calls \"oases of tripartism\" in Britain (such as the low pay commission and the health and safety executive) the government is reluctant to raise the spectre of 1970s-style corporatism as practiced by previous governments, though the TUC argues that use of such bodies can avoid the damage caused by \"parallel lobbying\" by unions and employers. </p> <p>Mr Monks yesterday pointed to a \"surge\" of recognition agreements with employers as evidence that \"unions now find themselves in the most favourable political and economic context for more than 30 years\", although membership growth has been hit by job losses in manufacturing. </p> <p>He also said that the TUC would press the Labour party to adopt three policies in particular for the next parliament. </p> <p>It wants a legal obligation on employers to provide training for workers, the provision of company information and consultation rights for British workers, and complete protection of the terms and conditions of public sector employees whose work is transferred to the private sector.</p>",
  "<p>The \u00a32.5bn flotation of Burger King could be delayed due to difficulties in recruiting a new boss for the global fast-food chain, Diageo said yesterday. </p> <p>The news emerged as the world's biggest drinks company announced an 11% rise in underlying profits for the year to \u00a31.98bn, as surging sales of Johnnie Walker and Smirnoff offset a slowdown at food business Pillsbury.</p> <p>Diageo had planned to float a 20% stake in Burger King on the New York stock exchange early next year but group chief executive Paul Walsh said: \"It is more important to put processes in place to maximise value than slavishly to try and hit a specific timetable.\"</p> <p>Diageo is trying to find a replacement for Dennis Malamatinas, who resigned as Burger King's chief executive in June. The company is also keen to get trading back on track - Burger King's operating profits grew just 4%.</p> <p>Diageo's biggest spirits brands fared better, achieving a 12% increase in sales with Baileys, Malibe and Cuervo among the top performers.</p> <p>However, the group's performance was held back by a slowdown at Guinness - which suffered its first fall in sales in Ireland - and at Pillsbury, which is about to be merged with General Mills.

  "A Labour government chucks money at a lame duck. Fawlty Towers is named as the greatest British television programme of all time. The world holds its breath as petrol prices soar ahead of a meeting of Opec ministers in Vienna. There has been more than a whiff of the 70s in the air this week. It would only take Jacques Chirac to murmur \"Is there a crisis?\" on his return to France from the Millennium summit in New York and we would have the full set. <p>The blockades of refineries and fuel depots in France show that oil has lost none of its ability to cause economic and political waves since Opec's heyday a quarter of a century ago. Saudi Arabia's announcement yesterday that it would increase oil production by 3% came after quite blatant arm-twisting by Washington, but is almost certainly too little too late. Oil prices dipped slightly after the news, but in the short term, the increase will do little to correct the imbalance between demand and supply. Analysts believe that the price of a barrel of crude could hit $40 over the next few months, particularly if the rich countries of the north experience a hard winter. The \u00a34 gallon looms. </p> <p>According to devotees of the new weightless economy, none of this is much to worry about because the technological revolution of the past decade has made the global economy much less vulnerable to oil shocks than they were in the past. But governments in the west are right to be worried. Rising oil prices have meant big trouble three times in the past 30 years - in 1973, 1979 and 1990 - and they could very well spell trouble this time too. Since the start of 1999, global oil prices have increased almost fourfold, and are now starting to have an impact on economic activity. In the US, the higher cost of fuel is reining in the boom; in Europe it has pushed inflation above 2% and prompted the European Central Bank to raise interest rates. Japan, only just emerging from a 10-year recession, is especially vulnerable to higher energy costs. It would indeed be ironic if it was the symbol of the old economy that finally put paid to the overblown claims of the disciples of the new paradigm. </p> <p>Governments are also right to expect a backlash from both producers and consumers as business costs rise and living standards are squeezed. One reason the Clinton administration has been calling in favours with Saudi Arabia is the fear that dearer energy will cost Al Gore votes in November's election. In France, the Jospin administration has already felt the effects of the direct action by road hauliers which - in complete contrast to Britain's feeble \"dump the pump\" campaign - has paralysed large parts of the country and forced Paris to offer them concessions. </p> <p>In the end, however, this is not a rerun of the 70s and eventually prices will come down. As Sheikh Yamani - another blast from the past - warned Opec earlier this week, the recent surge in prices is probably the oil cartel's last hurrah. Why? Because higher prices will lead not only to the discovery and exploitation of new fields, but also the search for alternative energy sources. \"The stone age came to an end not for a lack of stones and the oil age will end, but not for a lack of oil,\" he said. </p> <p>Western governments could and should be doing more to hasten this process. To the extent that they have been levying ever-higher taxes on oil but refusing to recycle the proceeds into real investment in wave and solar power, they really have only themselves to blame if the voters turn nasty.</p>",

  "<p>Fifteen graduates, who started their working lives at the investment bank UBS Warburg this week are among the most pampered and privileged new entrants to the British workforce. </p> <p>Along with 200 other new graduates taken on by the investment bank this year, they have received signing-on bonuses of \u00a33,000 each. They will get starting salaries of \u00a335,000. In March these 21-year-olds will receive their first, modest performance-related bonuses. But once they qualify for a full bonus year - after 18 months - they could receive a bonus of \u00a325,000. In less than two years, the graduates will take home more than \u00a380,000. </p> <p>They are not unique. At Merrill Lynch, one of the top tier American banks, new graduates are given signing-on bonuses of \u00a36,500 and a yearly basic salary of \u00a337,500. This year Merrill's top analysts received bonuses of around \u00a330,000. If this level of compensation is sustained next year, a 22-year-old who has worked for the company for a year could earn a total of \u00a374,000, nearly four times the average annual wage. </p> <p>Attractive wages and bonuses reflect the unmet demand for top graduates. Fierce competition now comes from top dot.com companies, which can offer the excitement of a new venture as well as the lure of share options. </p> <p>Heidi Plant, head of campus recruitment at UBS Warburg, said: \"There are plenty of good graduates on the market but competition is getting fiercer every year. Graduates have more choices and it is a candidate-led market rather than an employer-led one.\" </p> <p>One senior investment banker said that good graduates were scarce because they seemed more interested in dot.com companies. </p> <p>Traditional companies have had to enlarge the financial package to attract talent. Andersen Consulting recently announced a \u00a310,000 \"golden hello\" for new recruits and increased its starting salary from \u00a325,500 to \u00a328,000. </p> <p>Even smaller consultancies, such as Spectrum, a specialist in communications, are having to adapt. Susan Hahn, the company's human resources manager, said: \"Salaries have increased in the last couple of years because we need to be competitive with other companies. But we think that the quality of experience in the digital industry and the environment we offer are just as important.\" </p> <p>Spectrum gives its new employees a starting package of around \u00a332,000. This includes a signing-on bonus, offered for the first time this year. Employees receive performance-related bonuses in July and January. After a year in the company, the bonuses can be worth up to 20% of the graduate's salary. </p> <p>A couple of months ago the Guardian reported that 150 members of staff at ARM Holdings, the fast-growing British microchip designer, had become millionaires. </p> <p>\"Graduates who have been with the firm for just three years can be worth \u00a3400,000 or \u00a3500,000,\" Bill Parsons, ARM's human resources director, said at the time, adding that every employee had stock options. </p> <p>Companies such as UBS Warburg which have offered jobs to students during their last year of study might have to offer higher signing-on bonuses to stop them being enticed away before they join.

You have the option of making money in dot.com companies and it is more exciting.\" </p> <p>Lastminute.com, which employs 260 people in Britain, has no problem attracting good graduates, despite the collapse of its share price. </p> <p>The company's head of recruitment, Nicola Alcorn, says the firm has more \"approaches [from undergraduates] than we can handle\". The starting salary at lastminute.com is considerably lower than that offered by firms in the City, ranging from \u00a315,000 to \u00a320,000. Working hours can also be longer depending on business pressures, often including weekend work. </p> <p>Ms Alcorn says that the company is looking for top graduates and offers training. Morenike Williams, a 22-year-old Oxford graduate employed in lastminute.com's marketing department, chose this as her first job because of the environment. </p> <p>\"I did an internship with the company when there were only five people. It was really exciting. The learning curve is incredibly steep, and it is a dynamic vibrant place to work in.\" </p> <p>A spokesman for one of the big six accountancy firms in the City acknowledges that companies are having to pay graduates much more than they are worth when they leave university. According to him the aim is to \"lock in\" top graduates with potential, so that they can develop a career within the company. </p> <p>Andrew Williams, chief executive of Oxbridgejobs.com, a company set up to find jobs for Oxford and Cambridge graduates, explains why there is such high demand for his \"products\". </p> <p>\"We believe intellectual capital is replacing physical capital as an organisation's most valuable capital, and the best place to source intellectual capital is from the elite universities.\" </p> <p>If he is right then investment banks, leading consultancies and dot.com companies, which are still solvent next year will have to bid even higher for the next crop of top graduates. And they will have to find even more imaginative ways to hold on to them.</p>",
  "<p>Britt Allcroft, the woman widely credited with turning Thomas the Tank Engine into a global phenomena, has quit as deputy chairman of the children's television group that bears her name. </p> <p>Ms Allcroft's resignation follows poor reviews and disappointing cinema takings for the recently released Thomas and the Magic Railroad feature film which she wrote, produced and directed. The Southampton-based company's name is to be changed to Gullane Entertainment.</p> <p>However, the company insisted that Ms Allcroft would remain its \"creative cornerstone\" after signing a two-year contract to develop the Thomas brand from her adopted base in Los Angeles.</p> <p>Ms Allcroft may seek to sell some of her 8% stake to satisfy demand from US investors. Managing director William Harris will step up to chief executive and commercial direc tor Charles Falzon becomes president. Results for the year to June 30 met analysts' expectations as pre-tax profits climbed 39% to \u00a36.78m and turnover climbed 20% to \u00a318.08m. The dividend climbed 11% to 3p per share.</p> <p>Art Attack, a property acquired in March, and Sooty, the veteran glove puppet, made strong contributions but revenues were once again dominated by Thomas.</p> <p>The full effect that the feature film has on revenues will not be seen until the end of this financial year, but Thomas continues to perform strongly in all markets, and a new television series has been produced, the company said.</p> <p>Earlier this year Britt Allcroft plc rejected the chance to merge with rival HIT Entertainment, the company behind Bob the Builder. HIT was offering around \u00a310 per share, largely in new shares, but Britt decided to remain independent. Its shares closed down 2p at 605p.</p>",
  "<b> Stop the presses! Clinton having affair with a White House intern! </b> Oh, please. Monica Lewinsky is, like, so last decade. Give poor Bill a break. <p> <b> No, no, new century, new Clinton romantic exploits. </b> Ah, you must be referring to the heart-warming news that young Chelsea has found love. </p> <p> <b> Indeed. So tell me about this dashing young swain. </b> He has the fine and upstanding name of Jeremy Kane, is 21 years old and met Chelsea at university. He is currently an intern in the White House's speech-writing department and he and Chelsea have been an item for a year, bless 'em. </p> <p> <b> Still, that dark hair, those flashing eyes, that fixed smile, clutching the arm of a Clinton - there is something worryingly familiar here. </b> Yes, it does seem that the quickest way to a Clinton's heart is through a White House internship. </p> <p> <b> Presumably Hillary welcomed this besotted intern into the family with more enthusiasm than the last one her family had dealings with? </b> Apparently so. Young Jeremy spent last New Year's Eve and Easter with the Clinton family and was their guest at this year's Democratic Convention in Los Angeles. </p> <p> <b> How cosy. But isn't Chelsea coming to Britain soon? </b> Sadly for Jeremy, she has her sights set on studying at Oxford, as her father did before her. </p> <p> <b> And is this Chelsea's first love affair? </b> Not quite. In fact, they met when she was going out with Jeremy's friend, Matthew Pierce. Matthew, however, quit the scene as he found the constant presence of the secret service put a bit of a crimp in his social life. </p> <p> <b> Oxford-bound, tempestuous lovelife, romancing an intern... Truly, Chelsea does seem to be her father's daughter. </b> Yes, with the obvious exception that so far she has apparently done nothing to merit being pulled up in front of the senate and we have yet to hear ugly details of her bedroom habits. </p> <p> <b> Do say: </b> \"Aww, isn't young love beautiful?\" </p> <p> <b> Don't say: </b> \"Fancy a cigar, Chelsea?\"</p>",
  "One might argue that angels and mobile phones have much in common, delivering messages from another world that are frequently disturbing, incomprehensible or abruptly terminated. <p>One of England's most prominent angels, the 15ft golden weather vane that soars over Guildford cathedral high on its hill above the Surrey town, will soon serve both God and mammon, rising towards heaven on a One-to-One radio mast. </p> <p>When the angel is replaced on Monday, having been regilded with real gold leaf at a cost of \u00a320,000 paid for by the phone company, the pillar on which the vane rotates will appear unchanged, but will be a new steel structure concealing a base station and masts. </p> <p>Phone companies have long seen churches as a heaven-sent solution to their problems, and have often been welcomed with open arms by parishes at their wits' end to meet maintenance bills. </p> <p>The companies have fought bruising battles with residents over siting base stations and masts, exacerbated by the unresolved scientific debate over possible long term health implications of the radio waves. There are believed to be more than 20,000 masts in Britain, and an estimated 100,000 more will be needed over the decade. </p> <p>Against this background, thousands of churches, typically sited on the highest point of the surrounding land scape, isolated and with tall towers, appear a godsend. </p> <p>Although the practice has made conservation groups and some worshippers uneasy, it is blessed by John Prescott's environment department, and the Anglican and Catholic church authorities have each said that any decision rests with individual churches. </p> <p>Hundreds carry some mobile phone equipment, often disguised as flagpoles or lightning conductors. In return the churches get a rent, \u00a33,000 to \u00a330,000 a year, depending on the equipment, and often get help with restoration work when it is installed. </p> <p>The 12th century St Mary Redcliffe in Bristol has Vodaphone masts and cables concealed in the 292ft spire that Elizabeth I called \"the fairest in England\". St Mary's vicar, Rev Tony Whatmough, said cheerfully: \"The church has always been involved in the business of communication.\" </p> <p>However, the Churches Conservation Trust said it believed any approaches should be very carefully considered, both for aesthetic and potential long term safety reasons. </p> <p>The Grade II* listed Guildford cathedral was designed by Sir Edward Maulf in 1936 but not completed until the 1960s, when the angel, designed by a local metalworker, William Pickford, was added. </p> <p>Cathedral administrator Bill Evershed called the deal \"a win win\" situation for the cathedral and for One-to-One, which needed to update equipment sited on the roof since 1993. There had been no objections, he said.</p>"
