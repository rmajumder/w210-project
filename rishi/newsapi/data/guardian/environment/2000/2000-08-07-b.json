  "<p>Life, it appears, is not so bad for manufacturers after all. Despite the gnashing of teeth from the Confederation of British Industry and other lobbying groups about the fearsome price being paid for the overvalued pound, the official figures tell a somewhat different story. Factory production was up by 0.4% in the latest quarter - hardly spectacular, but broadly in line with the economy's trend growth rate. </p> <p>So what is going on out there? Are companies really clinging on by their fingertips or are they coming to terms with the high level of sterling and managing to stay competitive by cutting costs? </p> <p>The most obvious explanation is that the high exchange rate is a slow burn phenomenon and that it will have a gradual, rather than dramatic, impact. The respite British manufacturing is at present enjoying as a result of the continued strength of the American economy and the recent pick-up in Europe will be brief. </p> <p>An alternative and somewhat more optimistic scenario is that the strength of the pound is merely accelerating a trend in manufacturing that was already happening, albeit at a slower pace. Yesterday's industrial production figures show a clear split between the hi-tech parts of the economy and the rest - with output of mobile phones, computers and pharmaceuticals all booming. </p> <p>On the other hand, firms producing textiles or food and drink are really hurting. This would appear to be part of an international division of labour associated with globalisation rather than simply the result of the exchange. However, people who have something to complain about are always more vociferous than those who are doing well - hence the apparent disparity between the survey evidence and the official figures. </p> <p><strong> No confidence? </strong><br> </p> <p> Nycomed Amersham's chief executive, Sir William Castell, reckons that genetics will have as great an impact on this century as information technology did on the last. He believes that in 20 years' time it will be normal for individuals to have their DNA tested, and to have medicines personalised for their own specific needs. </p> <p>Nycomed is in the vanguard of this revolution as one of a handful of big companies supplying machines which can examine DNA effectively. So it is worrying that Sir William wants to locate the jewel in the crown, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, in the US. </p> <p>There will be little immediate impact in the UK. None of the 800 British employees will lose their jobs - at least, not for now, although there must be a question mark over the chances of APB's willingness to make substantial future investments in Buckinghamshire. But it is the thinking behind the decision to raise its American profile via a Nasdaq listing and a US address that is cause for concern. </p> <p>The decision about APB's future appears posited on where Sir William and his management team believe the biotech industry's centre of gravity will be - the US. If they are right, the decision makes sound commercial sense. Unfortunately it could also mean that although the UK has plenty of companies working hard at exploiting the results of gene technology, the country could miss out on the most lucrative part of the whole process - identifying useful genes in the first place. </p> <p><strong> BA - a hard slog </strong><br> </p> <p> Managing British Airways is an unenviable task: it is facing a struggle on two fronts. Both appear to be a hard slog. The first task is to improve operating results after last year's hefty losses. The second is to negotiate an alliance with KLM that will satisfy both sets of shareholders in terms of valuation and industrial logic as well as keeping regulators on both sides of the Atlantic on board. </p> <p>This, too, at a time of US-UK tension over air traffic liberalisation. </p> <p>Yesterday's results from BA, and the accompanying commentary provided little by way of hard evidence regarding the likely outcome in either area. BA has its strategy for taking on the competition from low cost airlines - smaller planes, more emphasis on more profitable passengers, cutting loss-making routes. </p> <p>But it is hard to assess to what extent the modest improvement in first quarter revenue figures was a direct result of the BA strategy and how much a general improvement in the industry. Nor will escalting fuel bills help the equation. </p> <p>As to the possible link-up with KLM, BA's verdict is that the deal is a complex one; others might choose stronger terms. The public posturing suggests that any price acceptable to the KLM end will look very steep from BA's point of view. The negotiations will be tough. </p> <p>Shareholders are unlikely to prove any trickier to persuade than regulators - particularly in the US. American regulators will be keen to use any leverage - and there will be plenty - that comes to hand to force a breakthrough in the stalled talks on air traffic liberalisation - otherwise known as greater access to slots at Heathrow. European regulators will want to have their say, too. </p> <p>At least BA management has few illusions about the task in hand.</p>",
  "<p>The European commission yesterday gave its first approval for a business to business internet-based marketplace but warned it was not giving carte blanche to the creation of similar ventures. </p> <p>It has approved the setting up of MyAircraft.com, a joint venture between the American aerospace groups United Technologies and Honeywell International. But commission officials said proposals for other online business to business marketplaces would be examined on a case by case basis. </p> <p>Industry will welcome yesterday's decision, for it indicates that the commission is not opposed to such ventures in principle. Such marketplaces, where suppliers come together to provide goods and services for business customers, are expected to dominate e-commerce. </p> <p>They are forecast to account for four-fifths of all e-commerce by 2005 - completely overshadowing general online retail activity. </p> <p>Business to business exchanges aim to provide one-stop-shops for business customers, cut out the middleman and spread the cost and risks of venturing into the e-commerce arena. </p> <p>Earlier EC officials had indicated that they were concerned that business to busi ness marketplaces could lead to the creation of anti-competitive cartels. </p> <p>Their decision on MyAircraft.com was expected to set a global standard for regulators. But Amelia Torres, a commission spokeswoman, said: \"The commission found no competition problems with this market, but we should not assume that will be the case with all the others.\" </p> <p>She said that Covisint, a business to business exchange between car makers General Motors, Ford and DaimlerChrysler, would probably not qualify for review by the commission, although it is being examined by the United States federal trade commission and the German cartel office. </p> <p>\"If these projects don't take the form of full-function joint ventures jointly controlled by the parent companies, there may be no obligation for us to look at them,\" Ms Torres said. </p> <p>The commission said MyAircraft.com was seen by third parties as a tool to make operations within the aerospace sector quicker, more efficient and less costly. </p> <p>It also took into account the relatively high number of similar ventures already operating or planned for the sector. </p> <p>\"MyAircraft.com will in all likelihood face strong competition from other similar websites,\" the commission said in a formal statement. </p> <p>Boeing, BAe Systems, Lock heed Martin, and Raytheon announced a similar venture last month. </p> <p>United Technologies is one of the world's leading aircraft engine makers. Its operations include Sikorsky helicopters. Honeywell International is an aerospace equipment maker and hi-tech materials group. </p> <p>\u0095 Royal Ahold announced that Dixons Group and Germany's Edeka are to join its online business to business venture, WorldWide Retail Exchange. Ahold noted that this brings the number of retailers belonging to the online procurement site to a total of 26 - with aggregrate annual sales of around 500bn euros.</p>",
  "<p>Andersen Consulting yesterday finally broke away from the Arthur Andersen accountancy firm after a crucial ruling by an arbitrator ended a 10-year feud between the two factions. </p> <p>Both sides were claiming victory after two and half years of arbitration by the International Chamber of Commerce. However, Jim Wadia, chief executive of Arthur Andersen, announced his retirement after the decision. </p> <p>The arbitrator, Guillermo Gamba, ruled that Andersen Consulting would have to change its name but it did not need to hand over a $14.5bn (\u00a310bn) \"divorce settlement\" - which might have crippled the consultancy business - claimed by Arthur Andersen's partners. </p> <p>The arbitrator concluded that the consultancy should be allowed to split off even though Arthur Andersen had kept to its contractual obligations. </p> <p>Both groups until yesterday fell under the umbrella of Andersen Worldwide. </p> <p>The Andersen Consulting partners will have to pay out $850m in fees to Arthur Andersen which were withheld during the three years of arbitration. </p> <p>\"This is total win for Andersen Consulting. We won. It's over,\" said Joe Forehand, global managing partner of the consultancy firm. </p> <p>However, Mr Wadia said: \"We are pleased that the arbitration has upheld our position.\" </p> <p>The bitter rows between the two organisation began in the early 1990s when Arthur Andersen, traditionally a tax and audit firm, started to conduct more consultancy work, which frustrated Andersen Consulting. </p> <p>The separation between consultancy and accountancy firms is expected to become an increasing trend because of calls by US regulators for more demarcation between the two. </p> <p>Andersen Consulting tried to negotiate its departure from Arthur Andersen three years ago but attempts to reach a settlement failed and drove the two into costly and lengthy arbitration. </p> <p>The consulting partners tried to buy their way out of the group but their offers were rejected. </p> <p>Andersen Consulting, which has spent millions of pounds in advertising, described the ruling that it could no longer use the name as \"a small price to pay\". It remains to be seen whether Arthur Andersen decides to the use the name for its consultancy business.</p>",
  "<p>Football's entire transfer system could be scrapped if the European Union upholds a test case next month that would make the controversial Bosman ruling pale into insignificance by comparison and plunge the game into unprecedented chaos.</p> <p>Payments of transfer fees for contracted footballers would become a thing of the past with, for instance, Manchester United's Roy Keane, the Premiership's highest paid player, able to move any time, anywhere without the club receiving a penny in return. </p> <p>At the other end of the scale, smaller clubs who have nurtured and developed rising stars and desperately in need of funds would receive nothing when their most prized assets move on. </p> <p>Until now, contracted players have been unaffected by the five-year-old Bosman ruling which changed the face of European football but only affects those who are out of contract and free agents. But the case now being studied in Brussels would, if upheld, extend Bosman to every professional currently employed in any EC country.</p> <p>The alarming prospect of an end to the transfer system as we know it was the biggest single revelation made by Fifa at its two-day congress in Zurich at the weekend. So anxious is the world governing body to prevent what it believes would lead to total disruption that it has joined forces with Uefa in a rare combined assault on Brussels. </p> <p>Fifa general secretary Michel zen Ruffinen says his organisation has received \"signals\" that the EU might be preparing to rule in favour of Italian club Perugia who have appealed against being forced to pay for a player it recruited from Belgium but who has now left the club. </p> <p>Perugia's ground-breaking case apparently hinges on the fact that under normal employment law, it should not have had to pay anything even though the player concerned was still under contract. </p> <p>In what is being widely viewed as a crucial test case for the future of the game, a preliminary hearing into Perugia's appeal is due to be held next month. If upheld, it could do away overnight with a system that has been in place for decades resulting in alarming ramifications.</p> <p>\"If we allow players under contract to leave without any compensation, it would be a disaster. It would kill football as we know it,\" Zen Ruffinen said. \"It would be impossible to police.\" The combined Fifa-Uefa group of experts is expected to hold its first meeting within the next three weeks to formulate an urgent recommendation to Brussels. </p> <p>\"This is a very dangerous situation and one we need to address very quickly,\" zen Ruffinen said. \"We may have to find some other kind of solution that binds a player to a club.\" </p> <p>Apart from potential transfer chaos, a global agreement that the World Cup should be rotated in future was the other most significant item to emerge from Fifa's 203-nation congress. </p> <p>Yet it is becoming increasingly clear that Africa may not be the only Continent bidding for the tournament when the principle of rotation begins in 2010. </p> <p>It was only after being assured that the African Continent would be in pole position for 2010 that South Africa agreed reluctantly to withdraw its threat to take the controversial 2006 vote, which it narrowly lost to Germany, to a civil court. </p> <p>But there is a growing body of opinion within Fifa that rotating the World Cup around the six Continents will not work. </p> <p>One proposal already being studied is to let any Continent bid for the event provided it has not held either of the last two. Under such a plan South America, for instance, would be permitted to take on Africa next time. </p> <p>\"Let's face it, we wouldn't even be talking about rotation if South Africa had won 2006,\" said Fifa executive committee member Chuck Blazer. \"Giving the tournament to only one continent each time stifles competition,\" he added.</p>",
  "<p>Here's some bad news if you like to keep up with the new economy: your reading list is about to get even longer.

Prepare now for the next global burst of internet brands - a raft of new local editions of established magazines. If you're lucky, you'll get through August's editions by December.</p> <p>Future Publishing has just imported Business 2.0 from Brisbane, California, in a slimmed-down localised UK edition, soon to be followed by German, French and Italian versions. Haymarket's Revolution is about to launch a Hong Kong edition, only months after entering the US market. And, in an ambitious global expansion that is causing some twitching among local competitors, San Francisco's Industry Standard - a trade title that happened last year to sell more display-ad pages than People magazine - is about to launch a pan-European edition from London, as well as a series of local-language versions from Scandinavia to South Korea.</p> <p>\"The new economy is both an American and a local story,\" explains Michael Parsons, London-based editorial director of the Industry Standard Europe. \"This is all about the flow of investment into the tech sector. A lot of money is now coming into the European theatre, and people here are desperately hungry for information about where the deals are, where the money is going. That interest won't go away as the American money won't go away.\"</p> <p>Parsons has been with the Standard since its launch in April 1998 as a mere 64-pager; today the issue size has to be capped at 365 ad-crammed pages \"as the printer can't cope\". He is busy recruiting big names in net journalism for an October launch: Mike Butcher from New Media Age, Chris Nuttall from the BBC and Georgia Cameron-Clarke from the Telegraph will be among 25 journalists working on the European edition under editor James Ledbetter. Up to half of the magazine will comprise material from the US edition, allowing access to the material produced by 130 people in the US. \"The success of First Tuesday shows there's clearly a tremendous interest at a grassroots level about what people can do in their own markets,\" says Parsons. \"We will be a bridge between the experience of the US entrepreneurial and investment community and the rest of Europe. UK web companies are thinking of themselves as European - everything else is provincial.\"</p> <p>Several US net magazines have long been cult items among UK net entrepreneurs, offering the lessons - lately, the mistakes - of west coast start-ups, and hundreds of pages of intimidating advertising from financial institutions boasting of $2bn mergers and follow-on offerings. Comag, the UK's largest magazine importer, now handles 20 internet magazines among its 500 titles. It estimates the internet magazine sector's annual market value at about \u00a311m - compared with \u00a35.6m in March 1999. \"Generally when there is a UK edition we stop importing the US edition as they compete with each other,\" says Sarah Marshall of Comag. \"The arrival of a local edition is a sign that the market is picking up for that sector.\"</p> <p>And picking up it is. Research from Future Publishing points to increasing demand for tech-market coverage in the UK - led by advertisers as well as subscribers. \"The American market is clearly important in this sector because of the development of new technology, but the European market is becoming important in its own right,\" says Jessica Burley, publishing director of Future Publishing's business and internet group, whose titles include Business 2.0, .net and PCPlus. Despite the downturn of tech stocks, venture capital continues to move into Europe in the quest for that successful business model. And that means booming advertising for what Burley calls \"indigenous-facing\" magazines as start-ups - and the banks and software firms seeking their business - try to make noise in their local marketplace. </p> <p>Business 2.0 currently claims a US circulation of 270,000. Future Publishing is guaranteeing advertisers 50,000 for the UK edition's first ABC, and is planning Italian, French and German launches later this year. \"You'll see us roll out the brand into large countries around the world,\" says Burley. Britain, she says, is currently \"an emerging market\" with its own needs. UK consumers may not favour the \"fat books\" of the US titles but we do apparently demand specific coverage of web businesses where Europe appears to be leading the US, notably in mobile technologies.</p> <p>There are clearly risks in localising titles that earned their reputations in the US, where the new economy is still generally held to be months, if not a year, ahead of Britain. The UK version of Wired, backed by the Guardian, folded after what some said was its premature arrival in a market where not enough of note was happening. </p> <p>\"One of the reasons people buy American magazines is to see what's happening in America - but the number of these people is quite small,\" says Richard Lord, editor of Revolution. \"To make a publication succeed in the UK, you need to strike a balance between this and mass-market demands.\" Revolution has recently taken this publishing trend from the other direction: selling its knowledge of the European market to US consumers. Its solution has been to go \"micro-niche\" - focusing purely on internet marketing. An early lesson Revolution learned in New York was that design templates do not travel: \"Americans can't stand sans serif body faces, so they had to go, and we had to increase the leading to improve readability.\" </p> <p>Lord believes Business 2.0 has \"made an admirable attempt to localise itself\" with its UK edition, and is not too bothered about the competition. \"There is a market for us all as long as we realise what we're good at and focus. Red Herring is serving an audience that cares about the financing of companies.\" Besides, Lord notes, there is no sign of a slowdown in the ad market: \"We grew in six months to take weekly what we had taken monthly.\" </p> <p>Keeping up as a reader, however, offers a broader challenge. \"It's simply impossible to read through all this stuff,\" says Mike Nutley, editor of New Media Age - a mere 76 pages this week. \"People value NMA because it's a quick read. Who wants telephone-directory-sized magazines?\"</p> <p>\u0095 David Rowan is editor of Guardian Unlimited</p>",
  "<p>* Channel 4's Big Brother (made by Bazal Productions which is part-owned by the Guardian Media Group) has already become a victim of its own success. The website (<a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/bigbrother),\">www.channel4.com/bigbrother),</a> launched last month, has been dogged by technical problems. </p> <p>First there were rumours of a hacker at large - Intel suspected a massive \"denial of service\" operation at large - but with 2m page impressions and 1m video streams a day, the likely scenario is that Channel 4's system just can't cope with demand (as of this week they are having to double their bandwidth). One other theory for the chatroom is that Sada, who was evicted last week, has molecularised herself and is causing havoc inside the machine. Either that or something is watching Big Brother. </p> <p>*Trinity Mirror New Media took advantage of the flat-rate net access dispute last week to launch its ic24's After Eight service, offering free surfing for its users between 8pm and midnight. Marketing director Jill Playle heroically called on the industry to stop confusing customers with offers that \"are not what they seem\", calling it free access while charging a set-up or monthly fee. All well and good, but four hours of free surfing hardly equals a free internet. </p> <p>*Last week's movers and shakers in the new media world include Ashley Highfield, Telewest's interactive chief, who has been hired to head up the BBC's new media department. Highfield will report directly to director-general Greg Dyke and become a member of his executive committee and global strategy group. Hollinger Telegraph New Media has also appointed Matthew Duffy as business development director to take charge of the new channels in September. </p> <p>*Emap Elan's efforts to thwart the BBC's Eve magazine - which launched last week alongside <a href=\"http://www.allabouteve.co.uk,\">www.allabouteve.co.uk,</a> the community-based sister site - have extended on to the web. On top of the \u00a31m TV advertising campaign to boost Red's sales this month, they are planning to launch a beefed-up website for the title some time in September. </p> <p>*Random House is to start publishing e-books specially designed for the internet. The new imprint AtRandom, launching in January, will cover literary fiction, biography, popular psychology, technology and business. Elizabeth Wurtzel and Donald Katz are amongst the commissioned list. </p> <p>*Inside.com, the glitzy US website for media luvvies which launched in a blaze of hype in the spring, is going to start charging for its features and analysis.

  "<p>Here's the theory. Britain can never hope to challenge the United States as top dog in the world economy, but it has the potential to play Athens to America's Rome. The blossoming of our cultural industries will civilise the hard-nosed form of enterprise coming across the Atlantic. </p> <p>Tate Modern is the symbol of a renaissance that will essentially write off the 20th century as a hundred wasted years. A new economic phoenix will emerge from the ashes of all those obsolete car factories and shut-down steel plants, taking Brit art, Brit pop, Brit software, Brit TV and Brit fashion to every corner of the globe. </p> <p>The reasoning goes like this. Britain is not very good at manufacturing. Lots of people make money out of making ads, designing software, running record companies and so on. Therefore, the future is with the filmmaker who can turn out the next Full Monty and the entrepreneur who can discover the next Oasis, rather than people who are making tangible products. </p> <p>This is a false syllogism. Britain's recent performance in manufacturing has indeed been poor (not least because of dreadful macro-economic errors) but the idea that the creative industries are so dynamic and unstoppable that they can plug the hole in the balance of payments is fanciful in the extreme. </p> <p><strong> Lowest ebb</strong><br> </p> <p>Two-thirds of British films are never seen because they are so uncommercial; British television is awash with repeats, cheap fly-on-the-wall docu-soaps and American imports; British pop music is at its lowest ebb since the days of Cliff and the Shadows in the early 60s. When the best that last night's TV can manage is the umpteenth re-run of Fawlty Towers and David Bowie is still the headline act at Glastonbury, it is hard to take some of the claims made for the cultural industries seriously. </p> <p>The figures do not lie. We run a massive balance of payments deficit in film, a smaller deficit in TV and our share of the world music market is falling. </p> <p>There could be the simplest of explanations. The end of ideology, the idea that class no longer matters, the scrabbling for the centre ground, the homogeneity implicit in the triumph of Americana have led us into a cultural cul-de-sac, where mediocrity rules and there are no causes left worth fighting for. </p> <p>Conflict is good for creativity, blandness deadens it. Seen from this perspective, the appeal of programmes such as Big Brother - in which contestants are cooped up in a house and battle against each in the hope that they will be the last to be turfed out by a TV audience - is the modern version of the Colosseum and illustrative of the same sort of moral decay that led to Rome's demise. </p> <p>But, for the sake of argument, let's assume that this is not the case, or even if it is that the forces of globalisation will result in the rejuvenation of western culture rather than a creeping homogeneity. Are there any factors that will limit the rise of the cultural industries? </p> <p>Two immediately spring to mind. One is the British cult of amateurism, normally dressed up as spontaneity or creativity. Our ideal hero is the chap who is persuaded to step in at the last minute for a cricket match on the village green, borrows a pair of flannels and a bat held together with sticky tape, then goes in and scores a brilliant century. But real life is not like that. </p> <p>It is no accident that the United States has been the dominant force in world cinema for the past century, because whereas Hollywood has always been consumer rather than producer driven, Europe's filmmakers have never had much truck with market reseach. </p> <p>As Finola Kerrigan and Nigel Culkin of the Univesity of Hertfordshire concluded in a study of cinema: \"Historically, the structural problems which are seen to dog the European industry emanate from the organisation of the industry itself combined with a reluctance on the part of the Europeans to adopt industrial and marketing tactics readily embraced by Hollywood. </p> <p>\"The European industries are very heavily production led and continue to ignore the importance of distribution, which results in their failure to secure a greater share of the global film market.\" </p> <p>So, if we want our cultural industries to thrive, lesson one is to treat them as an industry, with proper regard given to those elements - investment, research and development - that make firms successful in competitive markets. </p> <p>Make do and mend - a philosophy tested to destruction in parts of manufacturing - will not do if we are to alter a situation in which British films capture 1% of the American market and US films take 70% of the British market. </p> <p>The average budget for American productions in Britain is \u00a318m, against \u00a33m for British films. Alan Parker, who is chairing the film council, set up by the Department of Culture Media and Sport, wants Britain to concentrate on making fewer vanity films and more blockbusters. </p> <p>Some might not like this approach, arguing that Hollywood is about the lowest common denominator, dumbing down and formula movie-making. Given that America has given us Scorsese, Coppola and Altman, while we have given them the Carry On series and Hammer Horror, this is not an especially strong case. Parker's approach is the right one, and applies to TV as well as film, where the demand for programmes triggered by the satellite and cable revolution has outstripped the ability of programme makers to supply quality products. Greg Dyke's plans for two new BBC TV channels are fine in principle, but will only succeed if the money is there to make quality programmes. </p> <p>Lesson number two is that there should be less emphasis on high culture and more on mass culture. This is brought home in an excellent pamphlet by James Heartfield in which he argues that leisure has been captured by the rich. The amount of leisure time per person has not increased much since the start of the 60s, but more and more of it is being captured by the better off. </p> <p>\"We need to distinguish between mass cultural consumption and the more leisurely and reflective cultivation of pleasure at the other end of the scale. The first is characterised by greater technological productivity, accessing the same two-hour slot between the evening meal and going to bed. Media directed towards that time-slot is frenetic, demanding a short attention span, offering the utmost in sensational impact. </p> <p>\"The second is characterised by craft production values and an open-ended time-scale. These cultural products are marked by ambiguity, irony and obscenity as well as being heavily coded to limit entry.\" </p> <p>There is no doubt the elite does very well for itself out of the cultural industries and calls most of the shots. Vast dollops of public cash subsidise opera and ballet, for example. \"By minimising their unpaid labour, Britain's wealthy professionals have succeeded in expanding their appreciation of minority culture, pointedly reasserting their monopoly over society's leisure time,\" Heartfield says. \"Britain's leisure society is strongly weighted towards its leisure class.\" </p> <p>Does this matter? Well, not if we see culture as the icing on the cake, the bit of the economy that celebrates the human spirit and adds texture to life. But it does if we think that we can make a living out of cultural industries, because the market for mass culture in Britain is far bigger than that for minority culture. </p> <p>Unfortunately, culture is one of the bulwarks of British snobbery; high culture is seen as quality culture, pop culture as low-grade culture. A glance at some of the \"high culture\" on display at Tate Modern is a quick-working antidote for this way of thinking. </p> <p>In the end, the choice is between being a niche player or going for a mass market. The glamorous end of the fashion industry is designing haute couture for Paris and Milan; the real money is made in the high street. Britain's economic history is full of missed opportunities. It would be a shame to see the cultural industries go the same way. </p> <p> Great Expectations; James Heartfield; \u00a37.50 from Design Agenda, &lt;A HREF=\"http://www.design-agenda.org.uk\"</p> <p>Larry.elliott@theguardian.com\" TARGET=\"_NEW\"&gt;www.design-agenda.org.uk </p> <p>Larry.elliott@theguardian.com</p>",
  "Clare Short, the international development secretary, is to challenge international institutions including the UN, the World Bank and the EU to reassess the way they manage their aid programmes in the wake of growing criticism of inconsistency, poor coordination and life-threatening delay. <p>Ms Short's combative approach, which includes a defence of globalisation against the \"muddled thinking\" of some green activists, comes as MPs prepare to deliver a scathing attack on the bureaucratic incompetence of the EU's \u00a37.5bn-a-year aid budget.</p> <p>Accusing Brussels of \"Kafkaesque\" delays - including the need for up to 40 official signatures before emergency relief can be dispatched - the cross-party select committee on international development will tomorrow reveal that, nearly two years after Hurricane Mitch killed almost 7,000 people in Central America, the EU's promised \u00a3175m has yet to arrive. El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Guatemala will get the first \u00a357m tranche in October.</p> <p>The report will underline how it takes an average of four years and two months to deliver EU aid to survivors of global disaster.</p> <p>Attacks on the EU aid budget are not new. A frustrated Ms Short has made several, including calling it \"the worst aid agency in the world\". The former Conservative party chairman and European commissioner Chris Patten said this year that the EU should try to do less on aid, but do it better - or do nothing at all.</p> <p>The Commons committee, under the chairmanship of the Tory MP Bowen Wells, will also argue that too much EU aid - about half - goes to countries in southern and eastern Europe or north Africa, areas strategically important to the EU, instead of to highly indebted countries in sub-Saharan Africa and in Asia.</p> <p>Last night Mr Wells told BBC Radio 4: \"The problem is very bad. In the case of Hurricane Mitch the European commission made a statement to say they would spend millions to send to the victims. Not one cent of it has actually been distributed and therefore the whole purpose has been lost.\"</p> <p>The report comes as Ms Short prepares a white paper defending globalisation as a shift in world affairs as profound as the change from feudalism to industrialisation in the 17th and 18th centuries.</p> <p>An instinctive iconoclast, Ms Short challenges the assumptions of green activists who condemn development for others while themselves wearing Nike trainers and carrying mobile phones to organise protests over the internet.</p> <p>The white paper, due in the autumn, will call for a shake-up of the UN, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the World Trade Organisation and the EU aid programme.</p> <p>It will call for their respective roles to be clarified, so that greater cooperation between them can lead to greater consistency in policy. Concentration on \"big picture\" strategies instead of specific projects may also help.</p> <p>In particular the paper will call for international financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank to have a clearer role in coordinating action by individual donor countries.</p> <p>It will also discuss fears that the UN reform process is in retreat and sets too much store by consensus, resulting in an ineffectual body. A more clearly defined division of responsibilities between the World Bank and regional development banks will be proposed.</p> <p>Ms Short also wants a higher profile for so-called graduation policies, under which countries receive more aid if they follow sensible development paths. Rich countries need to do more to help poorer countries develop the capacity to negotiate fairer trade terms inside the new bodies, notably the World Trade Organisation, she will argue.</p> <p>But Ms Short will stress that the WTO is not a rich man's club. With better procedures, consensus and transparency it can act as a force for good.</p> <p>The paper, now in an early draft, is expected to argue that increased trade flows and investment, mediated by the big world institutions, will contribute to the elimination of global poverty.</p> <p>In contrast to long-held leftwing instincts, Ms Short will argue that protectionism cannot provide a safe wall behind which a poor country can develop economically. The best way for world's poor to get access to modern technology is through investment brought to their countries, largely by multinational capital.</p> <p>In a further rejection of old Labour orthodoxy, the white paper will reject what Ms Short describes as the \"keep your dirty capital out of Africa\" sentiment. Some non-governmental organisations suffer from a romantic idea of the noble poverty of the rural poor of Africa and south Asia, she told MPs recently.</p>",
  "Britain is soon likely to tax jet fuel for the first time: the government has promised to take action after the Institute for Public Policy Research's report, Plane Trading, called for financial incentives for airlines to cut pollution. The tax, of course, will mean higher fares: that might at last open our eyes to the environmental impact of air travel. <p>I live in London and like to think of myself as a bit of a green. I recycle, use public transport, prefer organic produce and bemoan the spread of out-of-town supermarkets. I know the high price of petrol hits poor people in rural communities hardest, but still find it gratifying that the motorist suffers. All this would be trivial, if it were not for an inconsistency in my attitudes, which is representative. For, like most of those who can afford it, I like to take holidays abroad and I generally go by plane. Stuff the environmental consequences. There follows some bad news for those readers - most of you - a bit like me. </p> <p>Air travel is, on most counts, the most environmentally damaging form of travel, well out-classing the car, let alone rail. Noise from planes blights the lives of tens of thousands, if not millions and is a major cause of depression, anxiety and ill health. Recent studies have shown that children at schools under the flight paths of busy airports may have a reading age nine months behind average - partly because of sleep deprivation and partly because their concentration and lessons are continually interrupted by noise. </p> <p>Heathrow's BAA visitor centre, where local residents are occasionally invited to vent their desperation, is sealed with eight plates of glass: most schools in the area are lucky to have double glazing. The government has twice tried to impose tougher restrictions on noise limits around London airports, but has been frustrated by legal challenges from the air industry. Many regional airports are not restricted by any noise controls. Nor is noise the only problem. Air pollution around airports rivals that in inner cities, and provision of roads, runways and buildings destroys wildlife. </p> <p>But local pollution hardly compares with the global repercussions of our addiction to flight. Air traffic has expanded at two and a half times the rate of average economic growth since 1960. Yet flying is the most polluting way of travelling per passenger mile, and air travel the fastest growing source of greenhouse gases. A passenger flying to Florida generates about as much carbon dioxide as a British motorist in a year. And nitrogen oxides emitted at high altitudes by planes also contribute to global warming. The air industry says we live with their pollution now and we can continue to do so. But the situation will get much worse. With flights to Europe for \u00a375 and to the US for \u00a3200, growth in air travel will continue - the telecommunications revolution, far from diminishing mobility, has increased it. </p> <p>At this year's Farnborough air show, industry bosses were cock-a-hoop, as orders for new aircraft, worth nearly $20bn, far exceeded expectations. Boeing projects a global growth of 5% a year for the next 20 years, in line with the government's prediction that air journeys from Britain will increase from 160m to 400m by 2020. Manchester is currently building a new runway; Birmingham is set to double in size over the next decade. The south of England is going to require the equivalent of another Heathrow, Gatwick and Stanstead put together. Many new airports are being developed by private companies, often on ex-RAF sites. </p> <p>Government policies and international treaties abet this. It is hard to credit, but aviation fuel is completely untaxed, giving planes a massive advantage over other travel. </p> <p>The EC does favour an international fuel tax, but the US is, predictably, opposed. Airlines get many other advantages as well. Duty free is another massive subsidy, as is the willingness of the department of transport to pay for road and rail links to airports.The old policy of \"predict and provide\", long discredited when it comes to roads, continues to govern runway provision. Instead of taxing air travel to reflect its damage to the environment, the government continues to predict growth on the basis of past trends and then provides for it. </p> <p>John Prescott has promised a white paper laying out the grounds for a \"sustainable aviation policy\" - but not before the next election. In the meantime, the development of airports and subsidising of air travel goes on. It is hard to think of any area of environmental policy quite so wanting. And yet if the government were to do the right thing, how many of us would thank them for it? Cars bad. Planes good. Happy holidays, hypocrites. </p> <p>\u0095 Ben Rogers's A J Ayer, A Life has just been published as a Vintage paperback</p>",
  "<p>Newly appointed historian Jean Seaton said yesterday that the next volume of the BBC's official history will portray the corporation as \"under siege\" during the Thatcher years. </p> <p>The volume, the sixth, is to cover the turbulent years from 1975-86, which ended with the sacking of director-general Alisdair Milne. </p> <p>Ms Seaton said: \"One view is that the BBC was the bete noire of the Conservative government. Mrs Thatcher didn't like impartiality and on the whole the BBC was impartial. </p> <p>\"Two series of programmes also particularly caused friction. In its reporting of the Falklands war, the BBC referred to 'British' soldiers, not 'our soldiers', which annoyed the government. </p> <p>\"Mrs Thatcher also said that its coverage of Northern Ireland was giving 'oxygen' to terrorism. </p> <p>\"Another view is that the BBC was affected by the global deregulation of broadcasting. Successful public news networks like those in America were beginning to fall and the economic climate was for privatisation.\" </p> <p>Ms Seaton, of the University of Westminster, will have free access to all the BBC's written archives in Caversham, Berkshire, its oral archives and senior personnel to complete the five-year project. </p> <p>She said: \"If I find something grubby, I'm going to make sure it gets out.\" </p> <p>The previous five volumes were written by Asa Briggs, the BBC historian from 1957-95. x</p>",
  "<p>HB or not HB? That is the question for the office worker. Some, of course, eschew the pencil altogether, leaving it to the rest of us to decipher the codes - HB, 3B, 2H, 3H, BB ... is there even a BB ? - as the trip to the stationery cupboard suddenly requires some serious thinking. With so many categories and sub- categories to choose from - and that's not considering eye pencils or coloured pencils - the eventual selection should be carefully considered, for a person's pencil habit will reveal far more than a CV ever could. Unless, of course, that CV is written in pencil, a sure sign that the author should never be allowed into an office environment. </p> <p>The modern pencil user falls into one of three basic categories: the propellors, the chewers and those who use the pencil instead of an inky alternative. </p> <p>Fans of the propelling pencil cannot be without it, and have a tendency to clip their pencils into their breast pockets with an air of brisk efficiency. When needed, they are unveiled in a flash, firmly gripped, poised and then irritatingly clicked three times. </p> <p>The chewers, on the other hand, will leave a damp legacy on every pencil that rolls innocently into their path. Unconsciously they put the unsharpened end between their front teeth and gnaw away until, eventually, graphite, toxic paint and splinters wreak their revenge. </p> <p>But the worst culprits must be those who use a pencil for everything, oozing neatness, tidiness and geekishness. They sit in meetings, pencil in hand, watching with an air of smug superiority as a colleague hastily scribbles over a mistake, before pedantically erasing his or her own. </p> <p>Thanks to their years of dedication to the graphite stick, they can tell you that the average HB office pencil can write about 45,000 words, draw a line 35 miles long, be used in zero gravity, upside down and even under water. It may not have occurred to them that, underwater, the paper would be ruined.</p>",
  "<p>Some members of the founding Bronfman family are understood to be putting final touches to a multi-billion dollar bid for the drinks arm of Seagram, the media business to be merged with Vivendi of France. </p> <p>Charles Bronfman, co-chairman of Seagram, is preparing a bid for the drinks division, which includes brands such as Chivas Regal scotch and Captain Morgan rum, in an effort to keep the 76-year-old business in the family. </p> <p>Several members of the Bronfman family, which still owns 24% of the entire group, are understood to have been unhappy about selling their stake after its $34bn (\u00a323bn) takeover by Vivendi. </p> <p>As part of the deal, announced in June, the French media and entertainment group said that it would sell the drinks business to focus on Seagram's media assets, which includes the Universal film studios and one of the world's largest record labels. </p> <p>Weekend reports suggested that Charles Bronfman had appointed Bear Stearns, the US investment bank, to help prepare a bid worth about $7bn. </p> <p>However, an offer document being drawn up by Morgan Stanley Dean Witter is expected to be sent to Claridge Investments, the family's investing vehicle, once it is completed in two weeks' time. Other companies expected to receive the confidential details include European consumer groups Diageo, Allied Domecq and Pernod Ricard prior to putting in bids of their own. </p> <p>Bankers have also made it clear that, if the family is to win the drinks business, it must be prepared to pay more than these global businesses. Charles Bronfman is understood to have approached several backers to help raise the necessary funds for a bid. The family's entire stake in the business was valued at about $8.5bn by the Vivendi offer at the end of June. </p> <p>Several members of the family share this stake, however, with Charles and Edgar Bronfman, the father of the current chief executive and chairman of the board, understood to be the largest shareholders. </p> <p>The family stake was felt to be the biggest barrier to the company being taken over before Edgar Bronfman Jr, chief executive and nephew of Charles, arranged the Vivendi deal. He described the decision to sell a business founded by his grandfather Samuel in 1924 as \"not without emotion\". </p> <p>Although his decision to sell won the support of most of the family shareholders, others were understood to have privately expressed reservations about selling the entire business. The company started life as a distiller and has only in recent years expanded into music and entertainment. A return to the drinks business would therefore be a return to the company's roots. </p> <p>Wall Street brokers are hoping that interest from the world's top drinks companies will help force up the price.</p>",

  "Trade secretary Stephen Byers has not exactly set the Thames on fire with his summer series of speeches about government's relationship with industry. That is partly because he is still a political juvenile, forever consulting the script (Tony's book of Third Way apophthegms) before opening his mouth. It is also that Mr Byers cannot, as a loyal minister, ask hard questions about the boundary between his department and others. On one side there are agriculture and environment (which control regional development agencies), on the other defence, a major purchaser from British industry, and David Blunkett's responsibilities for skills and employment. <p>There is a further, profound reason why he does not cut a commanding figure. Mr Byers wants to lay down principles. They veer in a free-market direction. State intervention is a bad thing. But this is from an MP with a seat in the north-east. So he also notes the \"exceptional circumstances\" when emergency aid or sandwiches round a table in Victoria Street might be justified to stop a firm going bust. He is trying to be too schematic. In our post-socialist age, trade secretaries should revel in the sheer pragmatism of their position. Employees afflicted by impending closure of their factory or office must have recourse to political action. They must expect - demand - the government attempts to save their jobs. The alternative is some horrible fatalism, which in turn becomes a recipe for alienation or destabilising anger at the injustice of the economic system. Governments must, in Baden-Powell's words, be prepared. Stephen Byers, so typical of New Labour in this, wants to believe in the essential benignity of big business. Corporate boards are full of kind and gentle people, caring for customers, co-workers and the common good. As if. Governments will find it hard to counter the power of multinationals. Big companies will threaten to pull out of one jurisdiction and relocate to a more favourable one - to stop such leapfrogging is one of the very purposes of the European Union. Unless ministers are willing to carry a big stick and occasionally issue threats, they are effectively conceding the field to corporate capitalism, warts and all. </p> <p>Mr Byers's confusion about his role is understandable. We lack, these days, clean explanations of what the state can do to make private business more effective at creating jobs and income. Preaching about productivity to gatherings of great and good business people may not achieve a great deal. The DTI is shortly to issue its latest plan for the regulation of competition. Ministers will be invited to keep out, leaving decisions to neutral experts at the office of fair trading and competition commission, as if appraising mergers were merely technical. It is not. The shape of a market, like the rewards of directors, is a legitimate object of political concern. What is wrong with attempting, in any given market sector, to create a \"national champion\" with all that entails for corporate size? Or railing at boardroom greed? </p> <p>In his speechmaking so far Mr Byers has steered clear of training and personnel, keys to adding value in all organisations. Perhaps it is because he knows many companies take a dim view of improving staff skills. Finance capital does not have much time for human capital. So it is usually the state that educates and that, as Labour recognises, is a lifelong project. If Whitehall were rationally organised, the DTI, education and employment would occupy the same administrative space. But would Mr Byers command it?</p>",
  "It was the night before the German grand prix, and David Coulthard was doing the ironing. This is not something you would expect to read in connection with the great heroes of motor racing history. Who could imagine the Marques Alfonso de Portago y Cabeza - Ferrari driver of the 50s, Olympic fencer, bobsleigh champion and legendary lover - doing the domestic chores? <p>But the times are different, and so is David Coulthard, the courteous, unassuming and thoroughly sensible 29-year-old Scottish grand prix driver who hit the front pages three months ago when he pulled his fianc\u00e9e from the wreckage of a private jet in which the pilot and co-pilot had perished. Coulthard is different from the heroes of the mythical past, different even from his contemporaries. And different, some say, from the David Coulthard that he used to be. </p> <p>A year ago Coulthard would have stuffed his dirty washing in a hotel laundry bag and called down to get it picked up. If a friend asked him which hotel he was in, he would probably have needed to consult his key tag. This year, all that has changed. Instead of leapfrogging from hotel to hotel, now Coulthard parks a large blue and white motorhome - the colours of his racing helmet, patterned on the flag of St Andrew - in a corner of the pad dock. In the virtual world of Bernie Ecclestone's formula one, this looks very much like one man's way of restoring a bit of normality to his life. </p> <p>\"That's absolutely correct,\" he says, sitting in the office of his father's haulage company in Twynholm, a village half an hour's drive from Dumfries. And, with telling clarity, he recalls the decisive moment. \"One day, about two years ago, I was at a test session in France, at the Magny Cours circuit, and I felt absolutely lifeless. I remember finishing early and checking in at the hotel and asking at the reception, 'What is there to do in this area?' And the guy didn't have an answer for me because there was nothing to do. Magny Cours is in the middle of nowhere. I went to my room. I had a book to read but I had no motivation to do that, and there was no one that I particularly wanted to talk to on the phone. I thought, what am I doing? It just felt like I was giving away part of my life to ... nothing. That's when I decided to get the motorhome.\" </p> <p>Racing drivers don't often talk like this. More usually, they want you to know what a great time they had with a bunch of supermodels at that party in Milan last week, or how fast their new speedboat will go. Coulthard is indeed engaged to be married to a model, the very thin and very blonde Heidi Wichlinksi, and his current salary is around \u00a35m a year but he seems to have held on to the sort of self-questioning modesty that befits his solid upbringing in a village where the name of Seaman Thos W Coulthard RN is on the memorial to the victims of the 1914-18 war. </p> <p> \"I suppose this is slightly bizarre,\" he says, \"but last weekend at Hockenheim I was in the motorhome alone because Heidi was working, and I did some laundry. I did some ironing - I haven't ironed in a long time. I guess it doesn't sound very glamorous, but I thoroughly enjoyed ironing a pair of trousers and watching the telly and getting myself ready for the next day. I like organising my own little environment. I can invite into it those I want to be there and keep out those I don't.\" </p> <p> Along with the desire to reclaim a bit of his life this year came a deter mination to rid himself of the reputation for lacking a mean streak on the track, largely the result of his honourable behaviour in Australia in 1998, when he stuck by the terms of a pre-race agreement and moved aside to let his team-mate, Mika Hakkinen, win the race. \"I went through a period when I was perceived as being a soft touch, somebody who moves over, who is not hungry enough to win,\" he says. </p> <p>Some suggest the ordeal of the air crash added a final touch of steely resolution to his character. He is reluctant to discuss the event and its consequences, unwilling to do anything that might cause further distress to the families of the two men who died, but in any case such a melodramatic claim crumbles under scrutiny. Since the accident he has indeed won two races, but he had won at Silverstone immediately before it. </p> <p>Tall, slender and unusually square-jawed, Coulthard can look - sitting in his car during a practice session, wearing his flameproof balaclava - like a Burne-Jones knight on the eve of battle. He has been racing since his father put him in a go-kart at the age of eight, he made his formula one debut in 1994, as Damon Hill's team-mate, and he currently stands second in the championship, which intensifies the requirement for him to fit endless sponsorship commitments around his schedule. And now, in Twynholm, his father has opened a small David Coulthard museum. But the image side of the grand prix world is not his thing. \"I go through periods when I think that, other than on the track, this isn't really very much fun,\" he says. \"It's having to try to deal with the constant questioning when things aren't going very well, people poking you to try and get a response and perhaps taking you close to the edge emotionally.\" </p> <p>He lives in Monaco, like several of his rivals. \"It's a very closed, controlled environment,\" he says, with evident approval. \"When you're there you don't get any reminders that you're a grand prix driver. But every other Thursday, when I walk through into the paddock at a grand prix, and there are 1,000 cameras there, the reality comes back - this is the part of this world that I don't like, but I have to endure it because it gets me to the bit I do enjoy.\" </p> <p>As a man to whom being grown-up means being in control of his emotions, he dislikes leaping around on the victory rostrum but does it because that's what the photographers want. \"I think, why the hell do I have to be a showman? But then I realise that the reason you get the opportunity to do this is because of the public's dream that it must be fantastic to do this job, and they want to see that it's fantastic. They want to live it through you. I haven't quite sussed that part out yet, and I don't know if I ever will.\" </p> <p>One part he may be getting sussed out is the significance of personal conflict, a vital factor in formula one's vast box-office appeal. As a boy, Coulthard watched on television as Mansell, Prost, Senna and Piquet fought often ill-tempered battles. Now he and Michael Schumacher are indulging in an acrimonious run ning squabble of their own. Two years ago, after a couple of mid-race collisions, Schumacher accused Coulthard of trying to kill him. This season the German and the Scot have tangled again. \"It makes life a wee bit interesting,\" he says, without giving the impression that he enjoys it. </p> <p>So what does he really think of Schumacher? \"Two different things. As a man I think he's a decent guy, a family man, quite straightforward. Given the hero worship and his vast wealth, it would be very easy for him not to be quite as normal as he is, privately. Publicly, as a racing driver, I'm not entirely comfortable with his inability to realise that he does make mistakes and it's not always someone else who's entirely to blame. </p> <p>\"I had a conversation with him last year, and I said: 'In your home, are you always right and your wife is always wrong?' He went: 'No, no, that's different.' </p> <p>\"I said: 'It's not different. It's values. It's understanding what right and wrong are. I believe I have those values and you clearly don't. Now we can leave this room today and never speak to each other again, and I'll have a happy life and you'll have a happy life, but it would be a shame because we live in the same world, as competitors, and part of the enjoyment I get from competing is to look my fellow competitors in the eye. The human side is very important.' </p> <p>\"He had to agree on that and we shook hands and walked away. Until the next time we fell out.\" </p> <p>Their latest spat erupted when Coulthard complained about Schumacher's habit of weaving across the track. For a couple of races they didn't talk to each other but before the grand prix in Germany 10 days ago, Schumacher made an unexpected move. \"It was a bit like what happens after two kids have fallen out in the playground. Eventually the one who thinks that maybe he was a little bit wrong makes the gesture of coming back and saying, 'Do you want a sweetie?' As we were coming out of one of the corners in the forest, Michael tapped me on the shoulder and said: 'Do you think there should be a kerb on the outside of this corner?' There was absolutely no need for a kerb at that part of the circuit. But I took it as his gesture at trying to start the conversation again. And I accepted it.\" </p> <p>He will retire to start a \"normal life\", he says, when he loses the buzz he experiences before a race, when he gets \"as nervous as I did when I was 11\". But losing his nerve is unlikely to play a part. \"I think some guys will probably never get fear in their whole lives, and other guys will get it. I think in Damon's case, he came up against fear. At Hockenheim last year I remember him saying to me, 'I can't do this any more.' I was pretty shocked. I was thinking, God, we've still got a few races to go - if you're saying that, why not stop now? Why take the risk? There are considerable risks in doing these speeds, and if you don't see that as a challenge and a thrill, then it's got to be too frightening.

  "The German government was in disarray yesterday over what its leader had heralded as a drive against the extreme right. <p>In a magazine interview the interior minister, Otto Schily, gave a firm thumbs-down to proposals for a ban on the most radical legal far-right group. Earlier the idea had been given a sympathetic reception by Mr Schily's cabinet colleague, the environment minister J\u00fcrgen Trittin. </p> <p>Almost two weeks after Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der launched a campaign against the ultra-right, it is still far from clear what the authorities actually intend to do. </p> <p>The weekend brought evidence of renewed police zeal in dealing with neo-Nazi skinheads; and Mr Schily told the news magazine Der Spiegel that he was considering deploying border police in areas of racial tension. </p> <p>But if the government hoped to inspire a general public stand against the extremists, the signs were not promising. </p> <p>Last week Mr Schr\u00f6der's spokesman called on Germans to become personally involved in combating neo-Nazi thuggery. On Friday night in the eastern city of Eisenach more than 300 people did gather in support of two Africans who had been spat at, kicked and chased by a gang. </p> <p>But a march against racial violence in D\u00fcsseldorf, a city of almost 600,000 people, at tracted no more than 1,300 the following day. It was called after a home-made shrapnel bomb went off outside a station injuring 10 immigrants, six of them Jewish. One was a pregnant woman who lost her unborn baby. No one has claimed responsibility. </p> <p>A rally in the same city in favour of tougher measures against certain breeds of dog two weeks earlier brought out 10 times as many people. </p> <p>On Saturday the police arrested 100 neo-Nazis in the eastern state of Thuringia as they tried to get to a banned rally called by the National Democratic Party (NPD). </p> <p>So far the main effect of the controversy has been to provide the ultra-right with a rare bout of sustained media coverage. The NPD has seized the moment to propose a march through the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin in January to mark the liberation of Auschwitz. </p> <p>It is the NPD that Bavaria's interior minister, G\u00fcnther Beckstein, said last week should be outlawed. The idea was taken up by Mr Trittin, a leading Green minister in the governing coalition of Social Democrats and Greens. </p> <p>But it was rejected at the weekend not only by Mr Schily but also by the interior ministers of Thuringia and Saxony-Anhalt, two of the regions most prone to neo-Nazi violence. </p> <p>They predicted a ban would run foul of the constitutional court and, even if approved, would merely drive the movement underground.</p>"
