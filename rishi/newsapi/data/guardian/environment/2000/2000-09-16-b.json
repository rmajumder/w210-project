  "<p>The past few years have been frustrating for investors in emerging markets. First the Asian meltdown wiped out almost all the gains made in the Tiger economies during the previous few years, then the Russian crisis stuck the boot in. And last year, Brazil's devaluation threw a further spanner in the works. </p> <p>To cap it all, the smart money was all being made in North America, on soaring hi-tech stocks. In the three years to 1 August the average emerging markets investment trust lost more than 20 per cent of its value; over seven years the return was a paltry 0.5 per cent. Among unit trusts the picture was not much better: an average loss of 16 per cent over three years and a 24 per cent gain over seven. But over the past 12 months, performance has improved greatly. With US and UK markets flat, and technology, media and telecoms shares heavily corrected, investors might be forgiven for thinking it could be timely to dip their toes back in the shark-infested waters of the world's developing economies. </p> <p>To an outsider, investing in emerging markets must seem like buying a house in a grotty area in the hope it will come up in the world. It is not quite like that. Fund managers who do not focus solely on one country place their bets across a number of emerging economies, shifting the weight of their investment as progress speeds up in one corner of the world and slows down in another. </p> <p>Ben Yearsley, investment manager at independent financial adviser Hargreaves Lansdown, says emerging markets are for those with a long view. 'You should be planning to invest for at least five, probably 10 years or more,' he says. 'An ideal situation would be a grandparent who wants to make a monthly investment for a child towards an 18th birthday present.' </p> <p>Probably not a good idea if you are about to retire, then, and most advisers would agree that you shouldn't tie up more than 5 per cent of your portfolio in these investments. </p> <p>The fundamental reason for investing in emerging markets is that growth is expected to outstrip the developed markets. 'Everything points to the development of these regions,' says Yearsley. 'But it still takes a leap of faith. After all, 15 years ago who would have thought Taiwan would become the world's dominant microchip producer?' </p> <p>Private investors should stick to vehicles with a global outlook, says Yearsley. In the year to 3 July, the best-performing stock market index was the Istanbul Composite, up 106 per cent; Manila on the other hand, was down a sobering 43 per cent. </p> <p>Emerging markets in favour include the world's eighth largest economy, Brazil. Its 10 per cent devaluation in January last year sent shivers through the markets. But fund managers are bullish again. Jane Hakham at Beta Global Emerging Markets says: 'We have 15 per cent of our fund invested there, which is overweight. They are undergoing continuing reform. Interest rates are down strongly, and they have met all their International Monetary Fund targets. The currency is also quite stable. Foreign direct investment remained strong during the devaluation - a healthy sign.' Favoured sectors are telecoms, banks and retail. </p> <p>With China's GDP up 8.2 per cent in the first half of the year, the country 'is looking better than at any time since the early Nineties', according to ABN Amro's chief global emerging markets strategist, Christopher Wood. By the end of the year, China is expected to be the world's largest market for mobile phones, with 70 million users. With a population of 1.25 billion, the potential is huge. Aberdeen Asset Management is reported to be planning to launch a China-only Isa later this year. </p> <p>Investors are understandably cagey about Russia, given the way the market soared and crashed under the previous government. However, presi dent Vladimir Putin has been making encouraging noises. 'He's made a good start, particularly at reining in the oligarchies,' says F&amp;C's McIlroy. 'There are companies there earning massive profits.' </p> <p>Indian shares have had a good run, spurred by the booming software industry. Fleming Indian Investment Trust is the top performer in the emerging markets sector over one and three years, with a 77 per cent rise in the past 12 months alone. Be cautious though: some fund managers are still bearish about India. </p> <p> This article is from the September issue of Money Observer, \u00a33.50 from newsagents.

  "Gordon Brown is preparing a series of tax incentives to turn the tide against green field building and revive run down inner cities. <p>Developers could be offered special allowances to clean up derelict land and renovate an estimated 1.3m empty buildings such as warehouses, it was revealed yesterday. </p> <p>The regeneration package, being finalised by John Prescott's Department of the Environment and the Treasury, is the government's answer to recommendations by a task force led by the architect Lord Rogers of Riverside, which last year urged ministers to provide tax incentives for developers and councils in special urban priority areas to encourage the rebirth of cities. </p> <p>The chancellor this week met Lord Rogers to outline his plans after the architect called for the government to move \"faster and further\" towards an urban renaissance. </p> <p>Yesterday Ed Balls, chief economic adviser to the Treasury and Mr Brown's chief aide, told leaders of England's seven main cities at their annual conference that November's pre-budget statement would herald a big urban initiative. </p> <p>Mr Balls said in Sheffield that the government would go further than the Rogers recommendations in promoting better land use and regeneration. </p> <p>With an urban white paper due to be published alongside the statement, and Mr Prescott's officials working on new measures to reform town hall finances, ministers could offer special zones, free of business rates, to bring developers into depressed urban areas. Cuts in corporation tax, capital allowances and bolder measures to recycle old industrial, or brown field, land are also being considered. </p> <p>The Treasury's announcement yesterday coincided with a report from academics in Cardiff which revealed that England's main cities are badly under-performing on the economic and jobs front. </p> <p>Analysing the economic competitiveness of cities with a single index measuring the wealth of individuals, average earnings, unemployment rates and \"knowledge based\" business the report by consultants Newidiem says none of the cities - Birmingham, Liverpool, Leeds, Manchester, Newcastle, Sheffield - or their surrounding boroughs are performing above the UK average. Only one, Bristol, is doing relatively well. </p> <p>Robert Huggins, director of research at Newidiem said: \"Our findings provide further proof of the existence of a north-south divide in economic competitiveness in the UK. It is clear that the majority of the urban areas of northern England do not possess the competitive advantage of their southern counterpart.\" </p> <p>London and the south is at the top of Dr Huggins's \"city competitiveness index\" alongside Aberdeen and Edinburgh. Many northern cities languish at the bottom of the list of 42 cities. </p> <p>The education and employment secretary, David Blunkett, speaking after the conference, maintained that the north-south divide remained \"stark\". </p> <p>Parting company with the standard government line that differences within regions are wider than any north-south divide, Mr Blunkett said: \"You have got major areas of deprivation in every part of the country ... some London authorities are very badly off ... but the scale of the problem in the major cities is very different.\" </p> <p>While in his home city of Sheffield one area was very affluent \"two thirds are not and that is the problem ... the scale, the number of people affected is such that you have to have special measures\".</p>",
  "<p>Brazil is the sleeping giant of global tourism. It is the world's fifth largest country, has the world's largest rainforest (the Amazon), the world's largest swampland (the Pantanal), thousands of miles of tropical beaches, and an enviably rich musical, culinary and architectural heritage. </p> <p>Just the sort of place, you might think, to go on holiday. </p> <p>But Brazil has never fulfilled its potential. It is a baffling statistic that tourists travel in far greater numbers to Argentina, which is several hours further away by plane and offers arguably less variety of activity. </p> <p>The last available figures show that in 1998 4.8 million visited Argentina, compared to 3.1m for Brazil. Britons, too, prefer Argentina to its larger, northern neighbour. </p> <p>Brazil's consistent state of underachievement can, in part, be explained by its poor infrastructure, itself partly the result of its own vastness. There is also the perceived threat of violence in cities such as Rio de Janeiro. And it doesn't help that in Brazil people speak Portuguese instead of the more visitor-friendly Spanish. </p> <p>However, this year the giant has begun to stir. A mixture of unconnected factors, such as the country's 500th anniversary of its sighting by Portuguese sailors and the rise of the supermodel Giselle Bundchen, have generated a new wave of international interest. </p> <p>This month sees the launch of a tourist resort near the north-eastern city of Salvador that aims to be the first major package destination for European and north American travellers. Tour operator Unijet is offering packages to Brazil for the first time next year. </p> <p>Without a doubt, the Costa do Sau\u00edpe resort is causing travel companies to look at Brazil through different eyes. Airtours will next year begin direct flights to Salvador from Gatwick in order to service the resort. At present, all scheduled flights come into the country via the business centre S\u00e3o Paulo, adding several hours to most tourists' journeys, so the Airtours flight will be opening up a part of Brazil previously only known to committed travellers. </p> <p>Salvador and the Costa do Sau\u00edpe are both in Bahia, a state the size of France that has a diversity of attractions - from colonial cities to fishing villages, from deserted beaches to spectacular canyons. It is waiting to be explored. </p> <p> An hour's drive north of Salvador's international airport, Costa do Sau\u00edpe is an ambitious attempt to build a Cancun-style resort. </p> <p>The builders claim it is the largest tourism development in South America. So far it has cost more than \u00a3120m and includes two five-star and three four-star hotels. Capacity is 4,000 rooms, although this will be expanded to 10,000. </p> <p>Costa do Sau\u00edpe is situated in a beautiful and hitherto-undeveloped stretch of coastline. The emphasis from the beginning has been on pre serving the ecosystem as much as possible. During construction, the builders relocated 32,000 plants and 586 animals, including a rare sloth. </p> <p>One part of the resort is designed in the colonial style of the old town in Salvador. Special hybrid grass was developed for a golf course that the managers hope will eventually attract a leg of the PGA tour. </p> <p>The resort offers sports such as tennis, beach activities, nightlife and shopping facilities. There will also be concerts of Bahian music and other demonstrations of Brazilian culture. </p> <p>The Costa do Sau\u00edpe information line is on 00 55 71 354 9696. English is spoken. </p> <p> Salvador was the first capital of Brazil. It was also the main arrival port for slaves being imported from the Portuguese colonies in Africa. As a result, it has the highest proportion of black people in Brazil and, not unnaturally, is the centre of Afro-Brazilian culture. </p> <p>The old town is a square mile of cobbled streets, colonial buildings and baroque churches. At night, restaurants spill out on to the pavement, bands play live music and groups of drummers march through the streets. Every night is good, although Tuesday nights and weekends are busiest. </p> <p>During one week at the end of February, Salvador is home to the most exciting carnival in Brazil. Millions of people follow floats around three circuits all through the day and night. The atmos phere is so hedonistic that it is virtually impossible not to have a passing amorous fling. </p> <p>Salvador is also the best place to sample Afro-Brazilian cuisine. The fish and seafood stews should be gulped down with a ice-cold rum-and-coconut cocktail. </p> <p>A popular and cheap hotel is the Hotel Pelourinho (00 55 71 243 2324), which is in the centre of the old town. An option near the centre but by a beach is the Marazul (00 55 71 264 8200). </p> <p>Traditional restaurants for Bahian food include Barga\u00e7o (00 55 71 231 5141) and Yemanj\u00e1 (00 55 71 231 5770) </p> <p> A 20-minute flight in a tiny plane from Salvador airport takes you over the Bay of All Saints to the island of Tinhar\u00e9. The only real settlement is Morro de S\u00e3o Paulo, a small village that is the favoured destination for Bahia's monied classes. The beaches at Morro de S\u00e3o Paulo can get quite crowded but a short boatride away you can find miles of deserted sand. </p> <p>The only means of transport on the island is by tractor, which will meet you off the plane and trundle you along the beach to your hotel. </p> <p>If you prefer to avoid the crowds altogether, half an hour away on a motorboat is Boipeba, which has a handful of places to stay and is blissfully tranquil. Like most of the other beaches in Bahia, the sea at Boipeba is particularly warm and clear. </p> <p>At Morro de S\u00e3o Paulo, the best equipped place to stay is the Villegaignon Resort (00 55 75 783 1010). On Boipeba, try the Pousada do Outeiro (00 55 74 9972 1535). </p> <p>Flights can be booked with AeroStar at Salvador airport (00 55 71 204 1335). The return fare is about \u00a360. </p> <p> Ilh\u00e9us is the town that chocolate built. The centre of Brazil's cocoa-growing region, it used to be one of the most prosperous cities in South America. Its residents built themselves a belle-\u00e9poque town hall and a neo-classical cathedral. </p> <p>It still produces cocoa but has been overtaken by Africa in terms of the level of production and the city is inhabited by poor workers rather than chocolate barons. Yet it maintains a decadent charm and is worth a visit. </p> <p>There are nice beaches in the city and nearby, but chocolate remains the reason to come here: for the Cocoa Museum or the chance to see a cocoa plantation in the surrounding countryside. </p> <p> Porto Seguro means \"safe port\", and it was here that the Portuguese dropped anchor in April 1500. As a result, it became the focus this year for Brazil's 500th birthday celebrations, together with demonstrations by indians who, for obvious reasons, claimed it was anything but a reason for rejoicing. </p> <p>The first place where the Portuguese stepped ashore was at Coroa Vermelha, around 10 miles north of Porto Seguro. The area is now owned by the Patax\u00f3 indians but can be entered without permission. A metal cross stands a few metres from the shore to mark the place where the first mass is reputed to have been held on the South American continent. </p> <p>Between Porto Seguro and Coroa Vermelha, the coast road is lined with cheap hotels. Driving south from Porto Seguro, the road turns into a dirt track and leads to Arraial d'Ajuda and Trancoso, which hip and hippyish travellers have turned into Brazil's equivalent of Thailand. </p> <p>Slightly further south, the impressive Monte Pascaol completes the sights of the heavily-marketed \"Discovery Coast\" - history records that the mountain was the first piece of land spotted by the sailors when they stum bled upon Brazil. </p> <p>There is no shortage of places to say in Trancoso and Arraial d'Ajuda, both of which are more laid-back than Porto Seguro. Try the Pousada Verde Agua (00 55 73 875 1453) on the beach at Arraial. </p> <p> Bahia, like Brazil in general, has its population and industry concentrated along a thin coastal strip. Inland, you get a completely different picture: much less developed and full of open spaces. If you only go to one place away from the coast, go to the Chapada Diamantina national park, a stunning area of canyons, caves and waterfalls. It is one of Brazil's main adventure tourism destinations and offers mountain-biking, horse-riding, caving, abseiling and trekking. </p> <p>The scenery is untouched and the small colonial towns are not as yet overrun by karabiner-wielding athletes, so one can enjoy the natural beauty and tranquility at ease. </p> <p>The Chapada has a reputation as a magical place that has enchanted many foreign visitors. Jimmy Page, the former Led Zeppelin guitarist, has a house in Len\u00e7\u00f3is and his image adds to the laid-back, tree-hugging vibe. </p> <p>Flights to Len\u00e7\u00f3is go from Salvador and cost from \u00a360 return (Nordeste 00 55 21 507 4488). A good option for a hotel is the Canto das \u00c1guas (00 55 75 334 1154). There are several agencies offering guides and equipment.</p> <p><strong>The practicals </strong></p> <p>Airtours (0870 9008639) flies direct to Salvador from Gatwick in nine hours.

  "<p>Life is not just a force for good, it is a force for its own good. Life has a way of managing things in favour of more life. And in the course of doing so, life manages a whole planet. It makes an atmosphere to breathe, and water to drink, and food to eat and then it recycles its own detritus. It hijacks sunlight and passes it around to the next user in digestible, shrink-wrapped form. Having done that, it disposes of itself, directly as nutrient for some other creature, or indirectly as a strata of phosphate or a layer of chalk or fossil limestone, or as energy to burn 1bn years later. </p> <p>Earlier this month, Austrian scientists detected bacteria, living comfortably in high clouds, reproducing themselves and - some think - serving the world by playing rainmaker, acting as \"seeds\" around which water vapour could become raindrops. </p> <p>But this heavenly host of living things surprised no one. Life has been turning up in improbable places for years. People who drilled a mile deep into the basalt of the ocean floor found tiny microbes living on a diet of warmth and rock. Submarine explorers have found huge colonies of strange creatures basking in a kind of chemical cornucopia at the bottom of the ocean's depths, far from any sunlight. Microbes have been found in acid flows, in lakes of soda, down the vents of volcanoes and on the underside of the polar ice, organising the planet for the rest of creation. </p> <p>Might things have got a little hot when carbon dioxide levels built up dangerously at the dawn of the Eocene, 55m years ago? Fear not. The rapid response team was on hand. An Anglo-American team of scientists reported on Thursday that plankton bloomed, the oceans became a garden and greedily mopped up the excess carbon, cooling the greenhouse world to acceptable levels. Not for the first time, nor the last, the biosphere had risen to the challenge, and adjusted itself. </p> <p>It is more than 30 years since James Lovelock, a freelance chemist with a background in medical research and a gift for devising sensitive detectors, worked for Nasa on the Mars exploration programme. While doing so, he began to form the idea of the biosphere as a self-regulating entity, of life and the planet as a kind of sensitive organism, not sensitive to any particular form of life, just to the principle of life. He called it the Gaia hypothesis. The novelist William Golding, a friend and neighbour, suggested the name. Gaia was the Earth goddess, the Greeks' Mother Nature. </p> <p>Touchingly, Lovelock reports in his latest book that he originally thought Golding had suggested calling it the Gyre hypothesis, after the gyres or vortexes that drive ocean and atmospheric circulation. The idea of Gaia caught the imagination of people everywhere. Gaia is a kind of metaphor for a very subtle lesson in the physiology of a planet. But Gaia became a reality, too, for the Greens, particularly those inclined to mysticism. Lovelock doesn't mind. He finds things to marvel at in Gaia, too. \"Some very distinguished scientist, I have forgotten his name, told me when I was quite young that the one thing you have got to keep right through your life or right up to your dotage is a sense of childlike wonder and once it goes, stop doing science,\" he says. </p> <p>He is fond of individual Greens, but he doesn't have much patience for some Green thinking, and in particular the Green attitude to nuclear power. Never mind the British government's little local difficulty with fuel prices, fossil fuels are literally beginning to cost the earth and meanwhile the Green campaigners are rejecting at least one easy answer to the great problem of how to power an economy without shutting down the biosphere with polluting greenhouse gases. </p> <p>This answer, Lovelock says, is ecologically clean and tidy and has a very bad press. It is nuclear power. \"I can envisage somewhere about 2050, when the greenhouse really begins to bite, when people will start looking back and saying: whose fault was all this? And they will settle on the Greens and say: 'if those damn people hadn't stopped us building nuclear power stations we wouldn't be in this mess'. And I think it is true. The real dangers to humanity and the ecosystems of the earth from nuclear power are almost negligible. You get things like Chernobyl but what happens? Thirty-odd brave firemen died who needn't have died but its general effect on the world population is almost negligible. </p> <p>\"What has it done to wild life? All around Chernobyl, where people are not allowed to go because the ground is too radioactive, well, the wildlife doesn't care about radiation. It has come flooding in. It is one of the richest ecosystems in the region. And then they say: what shall we do with nuclear waste?\" Lovelock has an answer for that, too. Stick it in some precious wilderness, he says. If you wanted to preserve the biodiversity of rainforest, drop pockets of nuclear waste into it to keep the developers out. The lifespans of the wild things might be shortened a bit, but the animals wouldn't know, or care. Natural selection would take care of the mutations. Life would go on. </p> <p>\"I have told the BNFL, or whoever it was, that I would happily take the full output of one of their big power stations. I think the high-level waste is a stainless steel cube of about a metre in size and I would be very happy to have a concrete pit that they would dig - I wouldn't dig it - that they would put it in.\" He says he would use the waste for two purposes. \"One would be home heating. You would get free home heat from it. And the other would be to sterilise the stuff from the supermarket, the chicken and whatnot, full of salmonella. Just drop it down through a hole. I'm not saying this tongue-in-cheek. I am quite serious,\" he says. \"They would be welcome to take pictures of my grandchildren sitting on top of it.\" </p> <p>Lovelock regards himself as an eccentric, and a radical, and he enjoys being a member of the awkward squad. The Gaia hypothesis was a huge delight to some, but it was a huge provocation to others. It also plunged Lovelock into a war of metaphors. Most of the battle was with the biologists, who had a different set of metaphors to defend. Some scientists, for example, call the Earth the Goldilocks planet, because Venus, hot enough to melt lead, was too warm and Mars, the frozen desert, was too cold, but Earth was just right for life. So in their view, the planet manages life, not the other way around. </p> <p>Another group thinks of the fullness and richness of biodiversity as the outcome of \"selfish genes\", hectically competing to replicate themselves. So for them, life is a battle for tenure rather than an invitation to the dance. And then along came Lovelock, a non-biologist who proposes something disconcerting: that the earth is fit for life because life made it that way. The battle was brisk, because life is the great mystery. There are three great stories that science has to tell: one of these is where the universe came from, one is where life came from and the third is where humans came from. The first and the last are being sorted out right now. Cosmologists think, for instance, that they have the story of creation figured out, except for the first 1,000th of a second. Anthropologists have settled on a consensus that modern humans emerged in Africa about 250,000 years ago, the latest and only survivors in a line of hominids. </p> <p>But the origin of life is a puzzle. Think of it as a kind of reverse murder mystery. The bringing-to-life happened in a locked room in a strange world 3.4 bn years ago. There is no surviving scene of the not-crime. There are no footprints, no strewn clues. The evidence was destroyed by the very creatures that rose from original experiments in fashioning the living chemistry from non-living chemicals. Whatever conditions made life possible were promptly erased by the action of life itself. The last surviving universal common ancestor went round eliminating all chances of new rivals emerging. </p> <p>Life came into a planet with an atmosphere of carbon dioxide, and began to alter it, producing as waste a dangerous, reactive gas called oxygen which could ultimately have brought the whole experiment to a halt. So life's - and Gaia's - next step was to favour a balancing set of creatures that consumed oxygen and breathed out carbon dioxide. But once that was done, the original atmosphere was gone, and water and nitrogen cycles were wiping away any evidence that might have been left in the rocks. </p> <p>Lovelock began thinking of such things three decades ago when he worked on Nasa's search for evidence of life on another planet. He proposed in effect that you could tell that the earth was alive from a million miles away. Its atmospheric chemistry would shout of life. He proposed that the 70s Mars probe instruments could confirm the presence of life on the red planet by detecting an atmosphere of dynamic disequilibrium. </p> <p>If there had been life on Mars, it would have been a very different planet. The atmosphere of Mars is 98% carbon dioxide and very stable. Venus is 98% carbon dioxide and a very nasty example of a runaway greenhouse effect. The earth no doubt started at 98% carbon dioxide too but today's atmosphere is a mixture of inflammable oxygen and reactive nitrogen with just a touch of carbon dioxide, and something is definitely keeping this explosive mixture primed. </p> <p>He says Nasa ignored his proposal at the time but the future search for life on planets outside the solar system will be based entirely on Lovelock principles. At some future point, fleets of spacecraft working in exquisite unison will focus on little specks of light reflected from parent stars, looking for the spectral signatures of telltale gases such as oxygen and water vapour and methane. </p> <p>You couldn't imagine oxygen and methane surviving together for very long in the same atmosphere. So if you spotted these in the gleam from a planet 30 light years away you'd start to wonder. \"If there is a lot of methane, oxygen won't rise by accident. So you have to postulate a process on the surface that is producing gigatonnes if not teratonnes of both of those gases all the time and not only that but regulating them, because if you didn't regulate them you would be in danger of making an inflammable atmosphere or something like that. So that then becomes conclusive evidence of life,\" he says. </p> <p>The American enthusiasm for possible life on Mars amuses him. \"I think it is all part of the American frontier mentality. This Mars is the ultimate place, we can go there when we have screwed up the earth. We have the technology, we can fix it. The national legend of America is very tied up with Star Trek and if you go to scientific meetings you hear Star Trek metaphors paraded around all the time and to them it no longer is a kind of story, it is reality and there is a great danger in their thinking.\" </p> <p>Lovelock is now 81. He and his wife Sandy - his first wife, Helen, the mother of his children, died after a long illness - have completed the 600-miles coastal walk from Poole, Dorset to Minehead , Somerset. He has pursued a long career as a kind of freelance scientist and he says big corporations are not for him, although he is happy to sell them his inventions. He doesn't care for science run by bureaucracies. He lives in an idyllic corner of Devon, on a 35-acre farm, on which he has planted 25,000 trees. </p> <p>He takes the long view of eco-hazards, he says. He isn't bothered by the menace of industrial chemicals like PCBs or agricultural fertilisers in the way that Greenpeace or Friends of the Earth are. A chemist from the start, he points out that according to a Royal Society of Chemistry survey, chemists live longer than most scientists. The big threat to the planet, he says, is people: there are too many, doing too well economically and burning too much oil. </p> <p>\"It's the people that count and the only message I would have to give is to stop fretting, stop looking for scapegoats, people are to blame for the condition of the earth. It is me, you, all of us that are to blame and if we are going to do anything about it we have to tackle it individually, not expect anybody to take the load off us and do it. If you are a housewife in Balham you are not, probably, doing anywhere near as much to damage the planet as suburbanites and exurbanites living around here, using their cars wholly unnecessarily in huge numbers of journeys and burning far more fuel. The more money you have, the more damage you can do.\" </p> <p>His new book is a hymn to science, and to Gaia and to the other makers of his great idea, and to the forces that made him choose to swim upstream, to stay independent, to be free to follow his nose. He grew up with Quaker principles, and became a conscientious objector in the second world war. He spent 20 years at the National Institute for Medical Research at Mill Hill, a lab with 100 scientists and six Nobel prizewinners, and then he started pleasing himself, usually by devising instruments that pleased big business, or Nasa, or the Ministry of Defence. </p> <p>He built a detector so sensitive it could trace seemingly infinitesimally small concentrations of chlorofluorocarbons in the atmosphere. Famously, he remarked that such low levels could do no harm. He should have written no toxic harm, he says. They were, of course, the chemicals that began to demolish the ozone layer. He thinks the big dangers to the planet are the greenhouse effect and the spread of humanity. Humans, just by their fecundity, and their economic demands, have begun to affect habitat and biodiversity so furiously that it might be that one day Gaia might not be able to step in and adjust the conditions to secure her own reign. The planetary regulator might not regulate so efficiently. </p> <p>In that sense, biodiversity was a kind of insurance, a spreading of bets to allow life to survive the kind of catastrophes - from outer space, or from volcanoes - that have seriously interrupted evolution at least five times in the last 600m years. Meanwhile, humans could get their comeuppance in some quite mundane but unexpected way. </p> <p>\"Every few hundred years or less, there is a natural geological disaster, like a big volcano. Tambora was the last, in 1815, and the one before that was Laki in 1783. Both of those were followed by two years without any harvest. Now in those days, people survived. There were famines, but people survived. What would happen now?\" he asks. He was speaking before the British pickets began their fuel blockade, and before panic-stricken consumers began clearing supermarket shelves. He was speaking long before word began to leak of UK government statement to be made on Monday about research into the possibility of some future collision with a large asteroid, an event which would darken the sky, shake continents, shut down agriculture and certainly clear the supermarket shelves the world over. </p> <p>He was simply taking, as he has done all his life, the long view. \"Two years without a harvest? It would probably bust civilisation. People would survive all right. It really would cut us back, and that is the sort of thing nobody really prepares for. It's not some ecological poison or GM foods or nuclear that is going to get us, it is going to be some perfectly ordinary natural event.\"</p>",
  "<b>Dear Roger,</b> <br> There is no better time to explore the environmental potential of the new economy than during a mini-crisis in the old industrial economy. The emergence of the new, knowledge-driven economy, symbolised by the rise of the internet, will make it possible in the next century to combine economic growth, consumer choice and improved wellbeing, with significantly reduced environmental harms. <p>The driving force of the new economy is not the internet but innovation: our ability to turn new ideas into businesses, jobs and products. Innovation is the key to economic dynamism and it will also provide the solution to many of our most troubling environmental problems.</p> <p>Take transport for example. The car of 2010 will be controlled by software and drive-by-wire systems in the vehicle and embedded in intelligent roads. As a result the 2010 car will be lighter and so vastly more fuel-efficient. It will run on gas or electricity. Smart cards will make road pricing an accepted feature of city life. The divide between public and private transport will be breaking down as car leasing and car sharing schemes become commonplace. </p> <p>We will create efficient, flexible, environmentally sustainable transport systems only by combining technological and commercial innovation, with social and political innovation in the way we pay for transport: innovation that sweeps across the whole transport system. That innovation-driven solution to environmental problems is what the new economy makes possible.</p> <p>Yours sincerely,<br> Charles Leadbeater, <br> Author of Mind Over Matter: Greening the new economy</p> <p><b>Dear Charles,</b><br> Odd that an argument that so exalts innovation should, at heart, be so conservative. Your car of 2010 has a great future behind it: it's much as I remember the car of 1980 being described in 1970. It's slow coming because manufacturers don't want to make their capital obsolete. Innovation is only implemented when commercially opportune. It won't consistently further social or environmental aims until we systematically manage markets to make profitable the technologies we want.</p> <p>Granted there have been big environmental improvements in car technology. But they have been swamped by people driving heavier, more powerful vehicles further and more often - because, among other things, motoring costs have gone down compared to incomes or public transport, amenities have dispersed and many top minds are dedicated to promoting car fetishism in one of those service industries you admire - advertising.</p> <p>The truly forward-looking approach is to twig that we don't really want cars, or even journeys, but access to amenities and services, and then aim to get this with less motorised movement. Sure, new technologies like internet shopping and teleconferencing could help. But so can old ones like bicycles, buses, lines painted on roads and integrated town centres. And un-technologies like walking. Innovation really isn't the point. We had better and fairer access and used less transport fuel in 1970: the vehicles were technologically crummy but we used them more efficiently.</p> <p>All the best, <br> Roger Levett, <br> Director of CAG Consultants, a sustainable development cooperative</p> <p><b>Dear Roger,</b><br> Your rush to embrace the past is alarming. I sometimes wonder whether environmentalists ever want to hear good news. </p> <p>Environmentalists should embrace innovation. Every day the new economy is creating opportunities for environmental improvement. Napster and MP3, within a decade will shift the entire world music industry from physical compact discs, manufactured with raw materials to environmentally friendly digital formats. The world's film industry spends $5bn a year copying films for distribution using a technology invented in the 19th century. Within a decade that spending will be reduced by 90% with the advent of digital cinemas. </p> <p>Cambridge Display Technologies is developing computer screens based on organic, water-soluble polymers that are both more efficient and more environmentally friendly than traditional screens. The Dyson vacuum cleaner is a classic case of win-win innovation: not only is there no bag but the entire machine has been designed to be recycled.</p> <p>These cases of environmental gain have been created by new economy entrepreneurs like Shaun Fanning, the founder of Napster. That is something no government or pressure group could have achieved. This poses a challenge for environmentalists whose stock- in-trade has been to complain about the excesses of the old industrial economy. Do you want to be part of this process of creating a new, more environmentally sustainable, modern economy or do you stand on the sidelines?</p> <p>Yours sincerely, <br> Charles </p> <p><b>Dear Charles,</b><br> As you acknowledge in your pamphlet, MP3 might cause more environmental damage - in energy and computers left on - than is saved. At best Dyson is recovering some of the environmental ground lost in the last wave of technological innovation, which replaced maintainable components with composite subassemblies which can't be repaired or recycled. </p> <p>Moreover very little \"recyclable\" plastic is actually recycled, because the value of the things you can make with it doesn't pay for the collection and processing, whereas most ferrous scrap has always been recycled. So, the most you can say environmentally for these flagships of the new economy is that they may turn out to do a bit less damage than the things they replace - but it may be a bit more.</p> <p>I assure you most environmentalists are avid for good news. But we're aiming a bit higher than this. And we're bored watching naked emperors prancing by.</p> <p>Actually there is good news around. Some is hi-tech: you'd love a trip round a state of the art de-inking newsprint recycling mill with integral combined heat and power, computerised heat-flow management and closed-loop biological water treatment. But some is as low-tech as unemployed people draughtsealing pensioners' windows, or building cycle routes. </p> <p>None of this happens without regulation and/or substantial public subsidy. You probably wouldn't class any of them as \"new economy\", but they do much more for meeting human needs without eroding the environment than designer vacuum cleaners or downloading recorded music without paying.</p> <p>Regards, <br> Roger </p> <p><b>Dear Roger,</b><br> As I argue in Mind Over Matter, environmentally friendly personal services should be as much part of the new service economy as the internet. My concern is that environmentalists seem so willing to turn their backs on the opportunity the new economy opens up to create a different kind of economy. As an adviser to a venture capital fund, I work a lot with young entrepreneurs in internet start-ups and new technology companies. Many of them share the values and outlook of the environment movement.</p> <p>As teams of new economy entrepreneurs present their plans to venture capitalists, they paint different possible versions of what the future might hold: how we might communicate, work, learn, save, shop, entertain ourselves. The venture capitalists decide which account of the future they want to back with their money.</p> <p>Environmentalists should be engaged in the same kind of activity: painting different visions of the future. But that would require environmentalists to engage entrepreneurially in creating a new kind of economy and I am not sure that is something you are ready to do. </p> <p>Yours<br> Charles </p> <p><b>Dear Charles,</b><br> I wonder where your impressions of \"environmentalists\" come from. \"Painting different visions of the future\" is precisely what thousands have been doing in Local Agenda 21 processes since 1993. Most are more creative and more significant than just getting music through modems instead of disks.</p> <p>People don't come any more visionary or entrepreneurial than David Green, who started the community insulation network; Alan Sinclair who has built the Wise Group into a major provider of environmental services, employment and training; or John Grimshaw, who imagined the National Cycle Network, then made it happen. I could list dozens more of the most resourceful, creative, inspiring people you could hope to meet.</p> <p>These aren't household names, and you won't have seen them in the venture capital world, for one simple reason. What they create produces public goods not private wealth. I don't know any new economy entrepreneurs so I won't make wild generalisations about them. </p> <p>If they are visionaries, great. If any of their ventures turn out to be environmental breakthroughs, better still. But this will only happen by sheer accident. There is no correlation between innovation and greenness: many of the greenest technologies are old. Profitability and environment, alas, often conflict because environmental resources and damage are still so cheap. 1960s-throwback novelty worship is a distraction from the real sustainable development challenge: how to live better, but within our environmental means.</p> <p>Regards, <br> Roger</p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.green-alliance.org.uk\" target=\"_new\">Green Alliance</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.digitalfutures.org.uk\" target=\"_new\">Digital Futures</a></p>",
  "<p>Modesty Blaise is dead. True to form, she was fleeing gunfire in a remote South American valley when she caught the fatal bullet; moments before, she'd revealed to steadfast sidekick Willie Garvin that she had a terminal brain disease, adding prophetically: \"I'd rather go with a bang than a whimper.\" </p> <p>Modesty was granted her last wish four years ago, in a collection of short stories which her creator, Peter O'Donnell, intended as the finale to her literary existence. She is still extant, though, in the long-running newspaper strip. And she's alive and kicking (literally - as a martial arts expert) on the internet, thanks to her fans and much to O'Donnell's surprise. </p> <p>Modesty's age has always been problematical: in the last book, Cobra Trap (now reissued <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,501183120,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a>), someone surmises that she's 52, \"though her body would have passed for 30\". On her website, though, a meanie has calculated that with so many adventures notched up, she must be over 70. </p> <p>Chronology is not O'Donnell's strong point, but his own creative span is undisputed. He started work as a teenager in Fleet Street on \"picture stories\" - illustrated adventure serials for young readers. Modesty is a daughter of this genre. She was conceived 38 years ago and O'Donnell, now 80, is still backing her into tight corners in the daily syndicated version. Though the scams and scoundrels she's been involved with over the decades have been updated, what hasn't altered is the moral line - drawn somewhat arbitrarily, it may seem - and the way in which O'Donnell strives to keep her on the right side of it. </p> <p>The outfit she ran - the Network - can't be classified as just another criminal gang. Based in Tangier, it was tacitly approved by the authorities, which it sometimes helped. Its operatives, though they handled many a murky assignment, never tangled with the trade in drugs or sex. And even when a load of butch broads muscled in on her act - in the Bond books and movies and TV's Charlie's Angels - Modesty refused to become a female Rambo. </p> <p>O'Donnell is proud of the way she has stuck to her standards. \"She does other things besides kick people in the head,\" he says. \"She's very compassionate and vulnerable.\" In the early days, she would have a little weep on Willie's chest when they had been in a dicey situation, but soon pull herself together. </p> <p>Modesty bid farewell to the Network several books ago and, as a very rich retiree, could afford to be picky about her subsequent challenges. She in turn has seen O'Donnell right, setting him up with a handsome home in an unspoilt Brighton square. Along with the 12 Modesty books, two other authors get pride of place on his study shelves: Madeleine Brent is blazoned on a set of bright dustjackets, while Bernard O'Donnell graces the faded spines of the other set. </p> <p>Both hold the key to O'Donnell's success. Bernard was his crime reporter father, who also wrote volumes on cops and crims and gave his young son a sniff of gangland and Fleet Street. Madeleine is O'Donnell himself in drag as a romantic novelist, proving that the way to writerly wealth is to have two personae. </p> <p>As a kid, he'd find stubbly scar-faced characters at the breakfast table, invited in by his dad, who knew gangland from Bethnal Green to Brighton racecourse. He was also on nodding terms with everyone in \"The Print\". \"My old man trundled me round the newspaper offices when I was 17, giving them all first refusal of this brilliant lad,\" recalls O'Donnell, \"and they all refused!\" But Amalgamated Press took him on, writing storylines for its stable of publications for young people. </p> <p>\"It was a hard school,\" he says: writing to order, to length and to time; literate but not literary. It was hackwork at its best, and it paid off in a post-war Fleet Street avid for fiction as well as fact. \"I used to write 20,000 words a week: an adventure, a detective, a western; short stories and scripts for strips.\" He worked in a big garret above El Vino's, but there was a flipside to the conviviality of hacks. Once, stuck for an idea, a surly editor he approached for inspiration glanced up from the racing pages and scowled: \"You're a fucking author, aren't you? Well, go away and auth.\" </p> <p>He did just that, creating Modesty in 1963 as a woman who could counter the butch heroes of pulp fiction. Nothing was wasted. From a wartime posting in the Caucasus he remembered a refugee girl, all alone at 12 or 13, who was given food by his unit, smiled her thanks and went on her way. He often pondered the mystery of her rootlessness, and years later used it as the basis for the footloose independence of Ms Blaise: the original wild child. When a film was mooted in 1964, part of the deal was for a tie-in novel. No problem: the novel did better than the subsequent movie, and he continued with the hardbacks, alternating Modesty with Madeleine, for the next 20 years. </p> <p>O'Donnell's is a road to fiction and fame that no young novelist today would recognise. It had disappeared, anyway, long before Fleet Street replaced the compositor with the computer. But, hard though it was, O'Donnell makes it sound a lot more romantic than the sunbeam path of today's golden literati, with their angst and their advances. \"I write from the gut about characters I care about,\" he says, as though nothing could be simpler.</p>",
  "<p>Britain ground to a near-halt for the second time in a week last night when millions tuned in to witness working class hero Craig Phillips triumph in the television event of the summer. </p> <p>The Liverpudlian builder walked away with a \u00a370,000 cheque for winning the cult game show Big Brother, beating the gay former nun Anna Nolan by just 2% in Britain's biggest-ever telephone poll. </p> <p>Craig, 28, whooped with joy when the result was relayed to him by the show's presenter, Davina McCall. A record-breaking 7.5m votes were cast in the telephone poll. \"I'm going to miss Big Brother shouting at me, telling me off every day,\" he said. </p> <p>After being nominated for eviction four times - more than any other participant - Craig's fortunes turned after he confronted \"nasty\" Nick Bateman in scenes that rivalled the best of scripted TV drama. Nick was thrown out when he was discovered to have flouted the game show's rules. </p> <p>Emerging from the Big Brother house last night, Craig pledged to give the prize money and any other cash he earns to a friend who has Down's syndrome. She requires treatment costing \u00a3250,000 in the US. </p> <p>Millennium Dome host Darren Ramsey, 23, had earlier become the first of the final three housemates to be evicted. </p> <p>The Channel 4 show began eight weeks ago when 10 volunteers entered the purpose-built house in east London, shut out from the outside world. </p> <p>The contestants were under 24-hour surveillance, their waking and sleeping hours broadcast around the clock on the internet. Every week, viewers voted for one to be evicted. The show became one of the most talked about on TV this year. </p> <p>Contestants have had the cameras constantly trained on them. Fans have been able to watch on the internet while highlights of each day's activities have been shown in regular bulletins on Channel 4. </p> <p>Leaving the BBC and ITV floundering, Channel 4 scored the TV hit of the summer with Big Brother. </p> <p>As the champagne flowed at the end of the series last night, executives were preparing to capitalise on the success with Big Brother 2. The Guardian has learned that a new version of the show will be aired next year. </p> <p>The station is in discussions with the show's producers, Endemol Entertainment, and the deal will be finalised in a few weeks. Holland is about to launch a second run, which will be closely monitored by Channel 4. </p> <p>Rival interest has been expressed by ITV and Channel 5, but Channel 4 has an option on a second series in its contract with Endemol. \"We would be stupid not to take it up,\" said Liz Warner, the station's commissioning editor for features. </p> <p>It is hard to overestimate the show's allure for Channel 4. Big Brother was perfect: innovative, youthful and yet delivering the sort of ratings that are almost unheard of at its Horseferry Road headquarters in London. </p> <p>The Friday show after the eviction of Nick Bateman scored almost 7m viewers. Along with Caribbean Summer, the intelligent packaging of test cricket with multicultural programming, Big Brother has completed the channel's transformation from an eccentric outsider to a powerful pioneer at the heart of British broadcasting. </p> <p>Some commentators dismissed the show as trashy, voyeuristic or exploitative - or all three. But that was to take it far too seriously. Its success came from its ability to give the nation something to talk about, at least until it ran out of fuel. To marry \"talked-about television\" with ratings success is the broadcasting holy grail, and it was delivered to Channel 4 on a plate. </p> <p>And at \u00a33m-\u00a34m for two months of daily television it hardly broke the bank. </p> <p>At the start press interest was lukewarm. But soon, as editors realised the extent to which their readers were fascinated by the series, coverage snowballed. </p> <p>Conrad Green, the series producer, said: \"It has been a real experience. We all expected it to be a real hit, but it's the nature of how it has grabbed people that has been the surprise. It really affects people - they care about the participants in the same way they care about soap characters.\" </p> <p>Now the challenge will be to replicate the success. Ms Warner believes it is all down to the \"casting\" - who is placed in the house. The format may be changed slightly - the house could be in a different location, there could be a celebrity version or a gay format. </p> <p>The show has made temporary celebrities of its participants - to the disgust of other members of the broadcasting B-list. At a recent TV awards ceremony former Big Brother housemates Sada and Nichola upstaged soap stars and got themselves plastered all over the front pages (by just being plastered). </p> <p>The Hollyoaks actor Gary Lucy was quoted as saying: \"They aren't even real celebrities, it's pathetic.\" Sorry, Gary who?</p>",
  "<p>Scientists will urge the government to set up a guard against destruction from outer space, in an official report to be published on Monday. A task force will report that collisions with \"near earth objects\" such as asteroids and comets are no longer the stuff of science fiction: they represent a real threat. A collision with one the size of a small village could wipe out a third of the human race. </p> <p>A 100-metre object crashes into the planet every 10,000 years - triggering a 100 megaton explosion in the air, larger than the largest H-bomb ever tested. A 1km object scores a direct hit on the planet every 100,000 years - with the force of 10m Hiroshimas. </p> <p>The near earth objects task force, led by Professor Harry Atkinson, a scientist who has worked both for the European space agency and Nasa, was set up in January to consider the growing evidence of danger and to take advice from astronomers. </p> <p>His report will urge the government to release \u00a320m for a new telescope in the southern hemisphere to comb the skies, and to \"buy\" time on a network of new or existing telescopes in Australia, Hawaii and the Canary islands to track the solar system's \"loose cannons\". The task force - made up of Prof Atkinson, Sir Crispin Tickell, the former British ambassador to the UN, and Professor David Williams of University College, London - will also recommend close partnerships with European and US astronomers to ensure systematic global coverage. </p> <p>The report will suggest support for space-based instruments to sweep the skies for potential cosmic traffic accidents and British involvement in European and US satellites which could rendezvous with asteroids far away and study them more closely. And it is expected to urge a kind of British \"spaceguard\" research centre, perhaps at the Armagh observatory in Northern Ireland, to keep disaster experts, astronomers, media and government in touch with each other. </p> <p>One problem is that the US - which funds a \"minor planet centre\" at Harvard - controls the detailed astronomical information from observers all over the world. The report could urge that Britain share some of the cost. \"It's an unhealthy state of affairs even if the US is an ally, when one country controls the information,\" said one researcher. </p> <p>Objects from space hit the earth all the time - at speeds of more than 10 miles a second. Most burn up harmlessly, as shooting stars. Hundreds have landed as small rocks. There is no record of any human being killed by a comet or asteroid - but a large one could destroy civilisation. The aim, the task force report will say, is to detect a potential collision years or, better still, decades in advance, giving governments of the world time to take measures. </p> <p>\"What they are talking about is setting in motion ways in which we could really deflect one of these things. That is the contentious one, because that involves nuclear weapons,\" said one astronomer last night. \"It doesn't say that, but we know it does. If you are going to deflect one, you have got to use a nuclear weapon. There is no other way to do it.\" </p> <p>This would mean launching a robot spacecraft to meet an asteroid, and then triggering a precisely calculated explosion which would knock it off course so that it would miss its date with the earth. </p> <p>Other bodies in the solar system are pock-marked by asteroid craters. The earth's asteroid scars have been removed by erosion - but there have been a number of collisions identified by planetary scientists. The most famous coincided with the death of the dinosaurs 65m years ago, but a 100-metre object exploded over Siberia in 1908 and wiped out 2,000 sq miles of forest. Two large asteroids have passed alarmingly close to earth in the last few years. US and French astronomers recently calculated that 900 asteroids, all 1km across or larger, are whizzing around the solar system on orbits that cross that of the earth. But Europeans want to start tracking smaller objects. </p> <p>\"A 200-metre object plonking into the Atlantic would effectively take out all the cities around the seaboards. Those smaller events occur rather more fre quently - they are talking about a once every several thousand years event,\" said Duncan Steel of the University of Salford, one of the leading authorities on asteroids and comets. \"The report highlights the way in which Britain can make a real contribution to the international programme - in essence to become No 2 in the world, behind the US. This would put the UK in a Europe-leading role.\" </p> <p>Jonathan Tate, a British army officer who several years ago began pressing for governments to take the threat from space seriously, is the director of SpaceGuard UK. He argued that a crash from a 1km asteroid - a one-in-100,000-years event - could kill 25-30% of the human race within a year. Assuming a UK population of 60m when it happened, that would work out at an average of 150 deaths a year over that 100,000-year period. One authority values a human life at \u00a3850,000. </p> <p>\"That actually works out at \u00a3123m a year to do nothing,\" he said. \"One of the major effects of this report will be to dispel, for once and for all, the giggle factor associated with the impact hazard. No sane person can any longer regard this as either funny or science fiction.\" </p> <p>Lembit Opik, the Liberal Democrat MP for Montgomeryshire, has been pushing the government to take the issue seriously for two years. \"If the report confirms a clear and present danger of an impact of global significance, and that we can do something about it with today's technology, I shall be happy,\" he said yesterday. </p> <p><strong>Space invaders</strong></p> <p> A <strong> comet</strong> is part of the builder's rubble left over from the making of the planets. Comets live at the far edge of the solar system and every so often are dislodged into long orbits round the <strong> sun</strong> , occasionally crashing into one of the planets in the way. </p> <p><strong> Asteroids</strong> - believed to be the fragments of a planet that never formed - live in a belt between <strong> Mars</strong> and <strong> Jupiter</strong> and every now and then one is tipped into a different flight path. </p> <p>Experts at Cornell University calculate the earth is at the centre of a network of asteroid \"superhighways\" and that a collision is inevitable at some point in the future. They know of 900 asteroids of 1km or more that could smash into the earth. But they calculate that there could be as many again yet to be detected. </p> <p>Asteroids are believed to be hard, stony, heavy objects rich in metals. There are commercial plans to \"quarry\" them in space and there are several space missions to explore asteroids and comets. </p> <p>Comets are mostly ice and dust and tend to break up under the gravitational tug of a big planet or the sun. Fascinated astronomers watched a dozen fragments of <strong> Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9</strong> crash one at a time into <strong> Jupiter</strong> in 1994. </p> <p>A large asteroid that hit the earth at 10 miles a second would turn into a fireball, sending sonic booms and shockwaves through the atmosphere. If it hit solid earth, it would form a crater 10 times its own size and the shockwave would level brick walls thousands of miles away. A big one would set the skies alight, and then shower the stratosphere with dust, blotting out the sun, shutting down all plant growth and condemning those who survived the shock and fire to death by cold and starvation.</p>",
  "Tens of millions of pounds might need to be spent to defend large areas of internationally renowned wetlands from floods caused by global warming, a report has warned. <p>The environment agency says councils might have to triple their flood defence budgets to prevent the low-lying Somerset levels and other parts of Somerset becoming swamped.</p> <p>In a paper to be discussed by the local flood defence committee next week, the agency estimates that councils could face a \u00a370m bill over the next 10 years.</p> <p>Somerset county council and North Somerset council will have to decide whether they can ask local council tax payers to foot the bill.</p> <p>About one fifth of the area is at or below sea level and is surrounded by five ranges of hills which drain into the levels. Seventy miles of coastline run along the Severn estuary, which has the world's second highest tidal range.</p> <p>The area has been hit by severe floods in 1994, 1997, 1998, 1999 and this year, and the report acknowledges that opinion is divided on how much of the problem can be blamed on climate change.</p> <p>It notes that 34 towns and villages depend on flood defences and that almost 37,000 homes are at risk. Fifteen towns and villages are protected by river and sea defences which fall below recommended standards.</p> <p>Stone Age dwellers built trackways across the levels and the Romans began attempts to protect the area from inroads by the sea. River defences were introduced by church bodies in the early middle ages and land drainage systems were introducedin the 18th and 19th centuries.</p> <p>\"Because man has interfered with nature over thousands of years an artificial landscape has been created which now has an internationally recognised conservation value,\" said Martin Weiler of the environment agency.</p> <p>\"International law says we have to conserve what is there. There is a tension between our need to protect the landscape and what nature is now throwing at us.\"</p> <p>Richard Bradford, Somerset county council's project officer for the county's moors and levels, said the paper was an attempt to raise awareness of the financial problems councils face.</p> <p>\"We have a problem which a single authority is not able to tackle alone,\" he said. \"The question is whether the responsibility should fall on local council taxpayers or whether the country's taxpayers should help because of the international importance of our sites.</p> <p>\"The flooding in recent years has brought the problem very much to mind.\"</p>",
  "Sierra Leone is to begin exporting its first diamonds next week under a complex new certification scheme aimed at curbing the trade in smuggled gems that has financed the rebel Revolutionary United Front's vicious war on civilians and propped up Charles Taylor's regime in neighbouring Liberia. <p>The Sierra Leone government and British officials who instigated the scheme say it will have a major impact on the trade in \"blood diamonds\" and the weapons and drug rackets that accompany it. But sceptics argue that the process is vulnerable to corruption and the questionable commitment of importers such as Belgium and Israel. </p> <p>The scheme follows a United Nations ban in July on trading in Sierra Leone diamonds that have not been approved for export, and a meeting the same month in Antwerp at which international diamond companies adopted strict measures to track the origin of gems in a bid to stave off more drastic measures, such as a publicity campaign of the kind that all but killed the fur trade. </p> <p><b> Tamper-proof</b><br> </p> <p> Every parcel of diamonds leaving Sierra Leone legally will have to be accompanied by a numbered, tamper-proof certificate printed in the UK and paid for by the British government. Each certificate lists a parcel of diamonds by carat and value, and includes tear off portions to track the movement of the stones and to ensure that they have not been undervalued in Sierra Leone, either through incompetence or corruption. </p> <p>The government's gold and diamond office in Freetown will issue the certificates. Its manager, Lawrence Ndola-Myers, works from a small room in the central bank, after the RUF burned him out of his original offices during the rebel invasion of Freetown in January 1999. </p> <p>\"We have learned our lessons from Angola and Congo, which did not have fake-proof certificates. We have gone to America, Belgium and Israel and discussed this to make sure everyone is committed. It will work. It's already started working. It will be very difficult for the RUF,\" he said. </p> <p>Four international dealers will handle all exports. There were to have been five, but De Beers declined to participate. </p> <p>\"We asked De Beers to be one of the dealers because they are the biggest in the world,\" said Mr Ndola-Myers. \"They said they didn't want to get into any funny business. They say that want to wait until there is a smooth running of the whole system. They will not be partaking.\" </p> <p><b> Concerns</b><br> </p> <p> The success of the system relies heavily on officials in the major diamond dealing centres scrutinising all imported diamonds to ensure that illegal Sierra Leone gems do not slip in. </p> <p>Diamond experts say it is easy enough to tell the origin of a diamond if it is packed with gems from the same area, but if a lone Sierra Leonean stone is mixed with others from Congo or Russia it becomes much harder to spot the illegal gem. </p> <p>De Beers is providing a selection of Sierra Leonean stones for comparison by officials overseeing imports in Antwerp and Tel Aviv. But Alex Yearsley of Global Witness, an organisation that produced a widely respected report on the impact of blood diamonds, questions whether the scrutiny will be stringent. </p> <p>\"In Tel Aviv they are patently not interested. The biggest achievement to date is to get dealers to sign a declaration that they are not dealing in conflict diamonds. In Antwerp they are far more proactive, but only under pressure,\" he said. </p> <p>Some dealers say that if Antwerp enforces the ban rigorously it will lose business to Tel Aviv, providing a further incentive to relax controls. </p> <p>There are also concerns about the probity of the process within Sierra Leone. </p> <p>\"If you are determined enough it will be easy to bypass this system,\" Mr Yearsley said. \"Officials can be bought. People say, 'How can you say the Sierra Leone government is corrupt?' But it is. This system could quite conceivably give the RUF a legal way of getting its diamonds out of the country.\" </p> <p>Whatever its flaws, there is general agreement that the system will make it harder for the rebels and others to dispose of illegal diamonds, and that it will diminish their value. </p> <p>But campaigners say the key to long term success is an international agreement requiring the certification of all diamond exports, no matter which country they come from. Britain is hosting a conference in London next month aimed at getting just such a deal. </p> <p>Hisham Mackie exported more diamonds legally from Sierra Leone in the first six months of this year than any other dealer - three times as many as his nearest rival. His office in the heart of Freetown is guarded by a military policeman. Mr Mackie is ensconced behind electronic doors and closed circuit television with a parcel of diamonds worth $60,000 (\u00a343,000) before him. </p> <p>\"It will work if they enforce it the other end. It it's not enforced it's just a hassle for the legitimate people. The bottom line is, you would not have a 100% system but you will get 80%. That is good enough under the circumstances here,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>The search for petrol may be at the front of our minds this weekend. But for those who want distraction, there is another big problem to worry about. We in Britain should take the threat more seriously of collision with large rocks from space. </p> <p>Last December 30, lost among the millennium celebrations, Lord Sainsbury announced the formation of a top-level task force consisting of Sir Crispin Tickell, Dr Harry Atkinson and Professor David Williams, to investigate the asteroid hazard. Their report is due to be published on Monday. They are to confirm that the hazard we face is not trivial, and to recommend a suite of actions that the UK might implement, as a participant in a global programme aimed at ensuring that we are not taken unawares. </p> <p>Although the US is by far the dominant player in this field, the UK is well placed to lead European efforts to tackle this surprising danger. We must secure the future of the human race against attack from above. </p> <p>We have got all our eggs stored in one basket. It's called the Earth. We must keep it safe. The dinosaurs couldn't see their nemesis coming. We can, and having realised the danger it would be negligent of us to adopt an ostrich-like stance. </p> <p>Forget, for the moment, Bruce Willis and the other heroes of those cosmic disaster movies Armageddon and Deep Impact. The way the universe really works is this. In our yearly orbit around the Sun, many space rocks pass us by. Some are large, some small. Some come near, but most keep their distance. The Earth collects about 40,000 tons of celestial debris each year, mainly tiny grains producing the familiar shooting stars seen on a dark night. But every so often a whopper slams into us. </p> <p>Of concern are those bigger than about a kilometre: maybe a mile at the outside. A crater 10 miles wide and several miles deep would be excavated by one of these. By dint of the extreme speed, the energy released on impact would be equivalent to about 100,000 megatons of TNT. Around 10m times the Hiroshima bomb. </p> <p>This is the threshold at which a global upset of the environment would be caused (putting it mildly), and we may expect at least a quarter of the human race to perish. How often might that happen? Answer: about once every 100,000 years. </p> <p>Now, is that anything to be concerned about? As a scientist, I have to compare it against other risks. If the kill-rate is one in four people, the chance of dying that way is one in 400,000 per annum. If you have a remaining life expectancy of 40 years, this means there is a one in 10,000 probability that an asteroid catastrophe will end your days. Statistics for airline disasters indicate that the average westerner's chance of dying in a plane crash is around one in 30,000. So asteroids are more dangerous than jetliners. We spend billions on the latter, and essentially nothing on the former. </p> <p>Compare the risk against other major catastrophes, such as nuclear power stations or chemical plants exploding. The government has safety guidelines for such things. Take that one chance in 100,000 per annum level of occurrence as reference: the guidelines say that if some accident has that likelihood and it would kill more than 100 people, then money should be spent if it is feasible to reduce the risk. If the death expectancy is more than 10,000, then the risk is defined as being \"intolerable\", and it must be tackled. </p> <p>A massive asteroid impact anywhere around the globe has that annual probability, and no matter where it hits one may expect more than 10m Britons to die. The safety guidelines indicate, then, that this is super-intolerable. The government must act. </p> <p>The average voter still thinks people such as I are joking when we argue that there is a significant hazard posed by asteroids running into the Earth. Bruce Willis has fooled you. As a matter of fact, it is about as funny as cancer, or mass murder. Not to realise that some things are dangerous without having it painfully proven to you is dumb. Hydrogen bombs have never killed anyone. But we can imagine the consequences of a war in which they are used in anger. </p> <p> What can we do, having recognised the danger? All that is advocated at this stage is a surveillance programme aimed at answering one question: is there a major impact due within the next century? Most likely the answer is \"no\". </p> <p>It is like taking out car insurance: you hope you won't need to make a claim. But if the answer is \"yes\" then, with adequate warning, we can take ameliorative action. The only viable method we know to divert an identified impactor involves nuclear weapons, but it is not like in the movies. We are talking here about having 10 or 20 years to get out there and give it a small but sufficient nudge such that it misses our planetary home, and does not deliver its far more powerful punch. </p> <p>The parallel with cancer is a pertinent one. Cancer screening costs relatively little and most often the result is negative. But if a tumour is found, then all the feasible cures are unpleasant, and they may only be used if the cancer is picked up early enough. And you won't find it if you don't look. </p> <p>Ah, but you have never heard of anyone dying due to an asteroid strike? No, there have been no really large impacts during recorded history. Of course not. You wouldn't be here to read about it if there had been. But there was a 15 megaton event over Siberia in 1908 that would have flattened the whole of London if the circumstances had been only slightly different. And Chinese records tell us of a meteorite explosion killing tens of thousands in the 15th century. </p> <p>Statistics can be misleading. Take air crashes. I'm a member of the Qantas frequent flyer club, an airline that has never had an accident. Does that mean that next time I board a Qantas jet to Sydney I have zero risk of dying? Circumstances can change quickly. Until recently Concorde was regarded as a paragon of air safety. Two decades ago virtually everyone, weather forecasters included, thought that hurricanes never hit England. </p> <p>The only nation spending any sensible amount on asteroid defence is the United States. And I do mean \"defence\" - the two most productive search telescopes are owned by the US Air Force. In effect we too, need to declare war on the heavens. </p> <p> Duncan Steel is reader in space technology at the University of Salford. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:D.I.Steel@salford.ac.uk  \">D.I.Steel@salford.ac.uk </a></p>",
  "From where Tony Blair is sitting this weekend, the political calculus looks pretty simple. A general election is probably only eight months away and Middle England has turned distinctly nasty. <p>Kyoto and Rio are faraway places of which floating voters care little. Worcester and Basildon are the places on the map that really matter. This line of thinking is understandable. Politics is a rough old game and the temptation for the prime minister to toss a few bones to farmers, truckers and (more to the point) Mondeo drivers is strong. But it would still be wrong. </p> <p>We said throughout the events of the past week that the prime minister was right to face down the protesters because it was a fight the government could not afford to lose. The same applies to the long-term struggle to safeguard the environment, where the list of disasters caused by climate change grows longer daily. </p> <p>It is not so long since the TV cameras that were this week focused on oil refineries in Britain were trained on a tree in Mozambique where a mother had given birth as flood waters rose. At a more parochial level, Portsmouth council yesterday sent its staff home after floods cut off power to its offices. The Environment Agency said torrential rain across large parts of southern Britain gave it the chance to test out new flood warning systems. So this, too, is a fight the government cannot afford to lose. </p> <p>To bridge the gap between the short-term political imperative and the longer-term need to halt and then reverse the climate change caused by global warming, the government needs to make a much more explicit link between taxation and \"green\" public spending. For instance, a systematic programme of home insulation, paid for by higher duties on fuel, would remedy a state of affairs where billions of pounds worth of energy seeps out into the atmosphere every day. </p> <p>The real problem, however, is that governments have woefully neglected public transport for decades, sometimes for ideological reasons, sometimes just to save money. So trains and buses have become a much more expensive way of travelling or moving goods; movement by road has become relatively cheaper. Without a viable alternative, the impact of higher taxes is to raise business costs and reduce consumer incomes. Companies do not switch freight to the railways or workers leave the car in the garage; they simply boil over with rage at a government that is costing them money. </p> <p>That cannot change overnight, but it will never change at all unless the government starts to argue for a more progressive alternative. One option would be to tell private motorists and road hauliers that road pricing will be introduced on UK roads in 10 or 15 years time, by which time the government will have made the necessary investment in new lines, new signalling, new rolling stock and new staff to ensure that there is enough capacity, at a competitive price, to cope with extra rail passengers and the extra freight. The road lobby would no longer be able to say that all its taxes were disappearing into a black hole at the Treasury; this would be a something for something deal. </p> <p>Has the government the political courage to go down this route? Well, the idea of linking higher spending to specific outcomes is part of the new Labour rubric and there is no reason why it could not adopt the same strategy when it comes to the environment. In their bones, most voters - even those clocking up 50,000 miles a year on the M1 - know that we have to find a better way. And those that do not are already going to vote for William Hague anyway.</p>",
  "<p>Here are the raw comments of a senior oil man speaking privately at the end of an extraordinary week both for his business and the rest of the country: </p> <p>\"This government appears to have no policies of any kind. It is just government through the media; presentation rather than substance. Their tone in private meetings is completely different than in public, where they are just playing to the gallery. Companies find that offensive. </p> <p>\"They [the government] do not seem to understand that we are bound by civil laws and rules. If we had forced our drivers out into what was a dangerous situation and something had gone wrong, we would have been roasted alive. </p> <p>\"We are now living in a culture which is risk-averse in a personal sense, where big companies such as ours have health, safety and environmental departments where rules are laid down and closely followed. We cannot treat our staff as soldiers in an army.\" </p> <p>The executive rolls on, criticising the police, pointing to the lack of crisis management planning, scoffing at the media. </p> <p>He tries to explode myths, such as the idea that the oil majors will make a killing from nervous motorists keeping their tanks full over the coming months. He tries to knock down all the conspiracy theories, such as Big Oil working to destabilise government. \"We have had a rather good relationship with Labour - certainly a lot better than previous Labour governments.\" </p> <p>Well, maybe it was until this week. But this particular Big Oil headquarters was positively fizzing with resentment yesterday evening. </p> <p>There is no particular reason to feel any deep sympathy. Oil has been one of the smarter sectors to be in over the past year or so. The pace of growth in the big western economies, which has helped increase the price of crude, means that cash is flooding in through the companies' doors faster than they can think of things to do with it. </p> <p>What is more, the wave of global consolidation in the industry has led to something of a bonus-fest for all involved. Men like Sir John Browne do tough jobs, but they get compensated accordingly. </p> <p>There is a chance now that this absolute lack of sympathy, this public relations disaster, together with the sudden chasm which has so clearly opened up between Mr Blair and big business, will land the oil industry with a windfall tax. </p> <p>An upstream levy would be easy to set up and it would fit quite snugly with a cut in petrol duty next spring in the event that further price spikes during the winter make some sort of action by Gordon Brown politically unavoidable. </p> <p>But the government should think long and hard before taking such a step. It should think back to why, in opposition, Labour undertook its prawn cocktail offensive in the City in the first place. </p> <p>Ministers should also reflect on the fact that the whole game of big business has changed markedly even in the years they have been in power. Total and Exxon are not British companies, Shell is half-Dutch, and BP is not British Petroleum any more. </p> <p>For good or bad, they are global firms. In the main, they strive to have good relationships with governments of every conceivable political colour all over the world. They seek stability and a minimum of interference. And, like it or not, they can move their businesses somewhere else. </p>",
  "<p>Turmoil over fuel prices this week has focused on the fact that tax makes up nearly three-quarters of their total. The last Conservative government introduced a gimmick which automatically increases the tax on fuel at a faster rate than rises in the basic cost of fuel itself, one aim being the environmental one of \"disincentivising\" fuel consumption. </p> <p>The present government increased the amount by which this multiplier works, with the result that in Britain - where people already pay more for most things than elsewhere in Europe and North America (\"rip-off Britain\" is an apt designation) - fuel prices have inflated sharply. The effect has been to yield an unexpected bonus in tax revenues for the government. </p> <p>Although protests over this issue are accordingly justified, it is seriously questionable whether the form of protest used - holding the country to ransom by preventing fuel deliveries - is itself justified. </p> <p>Many who drive do so from necessity; their livelihoods are at stake, as are their family concerns and personal commitments. Stranding them to coerce the government seems unjust; it means that they have been dragooned without their consent into a method of protest, whether or not they agree with its aims, which is at least inconvenient and at worst harmful to their interests. Protest is a valuable and valid form of political action; harming bystanders thereby is neither. </p> <p>At the centre of the problem is the demon Tax. The obvious chief aim of taxation is to pay for the national expenses - \"The point to remember is that what the government gives it must first take away,\" as J S Coleman put it - but it has important secondary uses as a device of social engineering: redistributing income in the interests of social equity, providing incentives and disincentives to steer economic behaviour, and cooling or warming the economy itself. </p> <p>In America there is a deep-rooted hostility especially to direct taxation, on the grounds that what people earn is rightfully theirs, and to have part of it expropriated is daylight robbery. If the justification is that taxes help the needy, Americans say: let them look after themselves. If the justification is that roads and hospitals are required, they say: let private companies build roads and charge tolls, and let hospitals be paid for out of medical insurance. </p> <p>In short, a familiar right-wing line is the reflex position across the Atlantic, contrasting with the acceptance in Europe that a community should pool resources for the common good, in which education, health and infrastructure are fundamental. Europeans recognise that a society has responsibilities to its weaker members, and that everyone should have an opportunity to start life on equal terms. In pursuit of these more humane ends, taxation is not merely a necessary evil, but a positive good. In an endeavour to persuade his fellow-countrymen to a more European view, Franklin D Roosevelt told them that \"taxes, after all, are the dues that we pay for the privileges of membership in an organised society\". </p> <p>But there are more and less acceptable ways of taxing. There is no argument against the principle of progressive taxation other than the selfishness exercised in secret at the ballot box, and which is so potent that it has been the chief determiner of British elections for decades. </p> <p>In the 17th century Jean Baptiste Colbert remarked that \"the art of taxation consists in so plucking the goose as to obtain the largest possible amount of feathers with the least amount of hissing,\" which is usually a government's aim - if it hopes to be re-elected. For the present government and its taxes on fuel, this has to be a timely reminder. </p>",
  "<p>The 60s were not all they are cracked up to be. It was just that things looked different. And the look was invented, as it usually is, by the fashion trade, the print media, by models and those who style and photograph them, but dictated by money and whose pockets the money is in. </p> <p>Mid-20th-century man was either poor or he had a tailor. Model-man was Nigel on the knitting pattern, captured by the potting shed with his teeth clenched, his sartorial splendour dependent on his old mum's willingness to buy wool and have a stab at Fair Isle. His female equivalent, known as the mannequin, was a lady of indeterminate age and equine physicality, a highly cosmeticised parody of the sort of middle-class, middle-aged married woman thought to have the wherewithal to purchase cocktail frocks by the score. </p> <p>As the second half of the century shifted, as it were, its gear, we miraculously became young. The Pill, the proliferation of specialised further education and the erosion of class barriers produced a new generation of wage earners, which meant the young were now a market force. As though by imaginative design, the natural gawkiness of extreme youth replaced Nigel and his lady as an idealistic frame for the display of consumer goods. A new breed of iconographer emerged, superseding the elitist gentleman-portraitists of high-societal aspiration; working-class boys who could see in the darkroom, talked all any'ow, drove flash motors and used their cameras like penis extensions. </p> <p>What they produced was heady, sexy stuff, technically flawless and as limitlessly promising as the midnight chimes of Hogmanay. Glossy magazines became biblical in terms of the compulsion of their imagery and influence. The young believed in what they saw, as though they were looking into a mirror and recognised themselves as both real and invincible. It was no longer inevitable that they would replicate their parents in form or in content. They made the rules. They also made what the media were pleased to call the generation gap. They were on their own. And at the epicentre of their quasi- revolution were three photographers, David Bailey, Brian Duffy and Terence Donovan, a sort of holy trinity of modernity, unchallenged arbiters of all that is true and beautiful.</p> <p>The problem for those who innovate at sub-culture level, who literally make things look different, is that they tend to get impaled on their own cutting edge, enshrined for future decades in the awesome reputation of the cult they subscribed to. If you imply revolution, show that something that seemed to be indelible is washed out and something else has been born, you set a date for yourself and others. The higher you hoist your petard, the more unequivocal its salute, the quicker the imitators move in to date you. That is the nature of sub-culture. Bailey knew this, hung on and survived. Duffy knew it, fancied he heard the muffled march of the philistines coming to trample him and buggered off to pastures new before they came anywhere near. Donovan knew it and railed against it till the day he died. \"These are the 90s?\" he'd roar at anyone remarking upon the celebrity of his youth. \"That was then, this is now.\"</p> <p>It is questionable that he would have much relished the resurgences of his work in exhibitions and coffee-table collections since his death four years ago, all of which somehow serve to increase rather than mute the enigma of his personality. His widow Diana, his colleagues and their friends have collaborated to produce these memorials as though they themselves were looking for a better understanding of the man himself.</p> <p>The morning after his death was announced, with the chilling undertow of its self-infliction, five men counting themselves as members of his most intimate circle telephoned each other in utter consternation. Anyone else, they said one to another, one times five and five times one, anyone else but Donovan. They'd have understood if it'd been a man with observable volatility. Just not Donovan. Not in a thousand years. He was too controlled, too balanced, too centred in his own skin, too philosophical, the very obverse of a suicide. They say so to this day. The more astute of them conclude that, perhaps, he was simply unknowable, that the sweet, equable, funny, generous, diligent, well-mannered Terry they knew merely chose consciously to guard his private self from all-comers. There was nothing they could have done</p> <p>Diana Donovan prefers not to dwell on the circumstances of her husband's death. To this effect she raises a slender white hand, palm outwards, and affirms, in a curiously well-bred version of the Jerry Springer show vernacular, that she will not go there. Suffice it to say that one day she wandered into his studio and found him casually perusing colour transparencies and muttering \"every one a Bruegel\" as he dropped them in the bin, and another day she went there and saw that he was dead. Her devastation is her own affair. </p> <p>She has negotiated her own emotional survival by concentrating on the positive, happy aspects of her marriage and by immersing herself in the task of bringing the enormous diversity of Donovan's contribution to the visual arts to a forgetful public.</p> <p>Her account of their first meeting is succinct and quaintly illuminating. You have to imagine the pair of them. She wasn't a model, but she was pretty and tiny and blonde and very earnestly middle class, thrilled to have landed a job as picture editor for one of the many hopefully seminal glossies that came and went in the mid-60s. He was, well, he was Terence Donovan, the Terence Donovan; built like a brick outhouse, spoiled for choice sex-wise, unreconstructed East End accent, open-top Bentley with white-wall tyres parked outside, Savile Row suit all buttoned up, minions bearing equipment, the full monty. They wouldn't normally have afforded him, but he was a friend of the proprietor and a jolly nice bloke, and besides, they were saving on model fees by using the girls in the office. They combed their hair, did their lipstick and dressed up in raincoats and sou'westers and did what they were told. </p> <p>When the session was over he offered her a lift home. She thought that was rather splendid until they got to Knightsbridge and he said that's it, we're home. As she lived in Earl's Court at the time, she pointed out that it wasn't her home. No, he said, but it is mine. So she thanked him, got out of the car and took a bus the rest of the way. No, he didn't ask her in. No, definitely not. And no, she wasn't remotely offended. All gifted people are eccentric, she reasoned with the impeccable logic of one who would doubtless attribute ego-centricity to the same gesture by a non-gifted person. You had to accept it from such a great photographer. </p> <p>Years later she accepted the rules of their engagement in a similarly deferential manner. No holidays, he said to her. No shopping. Perfectly reasonable, she thought. She is particularly delighted with the episode of the graphologist. While debating with himself whether or not to propose marriage, he sneaked a recipe she'd jotted down in her kitchen and sent it off to a pal of his who interpreted handwriting for the edification of Scotland Yard crime-busters. </p> <p>The resultant report, ill-spelled and typed on a manual typewriter from which the bogeys had not been removed from the \"a\"s and \"e\"s, she continues to treasure as an intuitive and accurate character analysis of herself. It describes a young lady of exceptional taste and refinement, particularly good at colour matching; self-reliant, detached, practical, discreet, loyal and instinctual, an ideal partner for an artistic, enterprising, active man. It is anyone's guess what Donovan made of it; the western equivalent of a gentle geisha, perhaps, but at all events he popped the question, doubts dispelled.</p> <p>He was never nebulous about his expectations of her as a wife. \"Di-di\", he would say to her, it being his special name, \"Di-di, we are all alone in this world. You've got to learn to be alone.\" She didn't understand at first. Having been brought up to imagine that marriage meant an indissoluble togetherness, a belonging with and belonging to, she found it a little daunting to be thrown on her own resources while her husband spent his days in the exclusive company of the world's most beautiful and alluring women. It did not pass her by that her newly acquired husband might easily acquire a new wife. </p> <p>\"You've got to think about things, Di-di,\" he'd say. \"You've got to think things out.\" So she thought about it and concluded there wasn't much point in whining. \"Poor old Terry,\" she'd say, \"stuck in a studio all day with Celia Hammond/Jean Shrimpton/ Cindy Crawford/whoever. Ah well, somebody's got to do it.\"</p> <p>When their first child was imminent, he drove her to Queen Charlotte's Hospital, walked her into reception and drove himself home. There was never any question of him being there. No point in being sad about it, either. It was her business, childbirth. The doctor woke him from a deep sleep to tell him his son had been born. That was just the way he was. Horses for courses, sort of thing. She felt he wanted a family, wanted in some way to replicate the closeness of his childhood family group, with mum and dad downstairs, and Aunt Doll and Uncle Bill and Cousin Roy upstairs. Not that he saw that much of them. He was evacuated by himself to Devon during the war, his father was a long-distance lorry driver and his mum worked full time as a Woolworths floor walker and Cousin Roy was too old to be a companion.</p> <p>So he was very much a loner. He did his very best to train her, as she puts it, in the same mode. And she's grateful now, she really is. It wasn't always easy. Sometimes, she'd fly off the handle about something, get rattled and express anger. \"Hang on,\" he'd, say, \"let's get the right perspective on this. Let's get the whole picture. Let's not pretend it isn't what it is or it is what it isn't.\" And, of course, she'd sometimes feel like giving him a slap, but he was always right, always correctly focused.</p> <p>She never really understood his religious proclivities. Not then, anyway, perhaps a little more since his death. They didn't scrutinise each others' psyches, you see. He was a Zen Buddhist, she was Roman Catholic. These things are private, and besides, he always said there wasn't much difference between the two, apart from the guilt. So far as Diana was aware, he'd been to see The Seven Samurai at about the same time he did his National Service and came out of the cinema with an abiding passion for Japan and all things Japanese. It happened to a lot of people in the 50s. You either fell for La Dolce Vita or, if you were of a more deeply romantic, soulful stamp, Seven Samurai did it for you.</p> <p>Like all morality tales, it is about suffering humanity and what it takes to struggle through this vale of tears with some degree of dignity. The fact that orientals appear to have a different physical centre of gravity from ours, particularly noticeable when they're running about bashing each other with sticks, makes it all seem new and exotic, but the messages are all there, all the good old enduring, universal clich\u00e9s, writ large and bleak in subtitles beneath the seething paddy-fields of another time and another country.</p> <p>There is strength in unity. Selfishness makes you weak. Don't stew in your own juice. A problem shared is a problem halved. If you need help, ask for it. Defence is more difficult than attack. Choose your own battlefield. The enemy is as afraid of you as you are of him; use this against him. Courage is only an attitude you strike. Bravado is better than nothing. Pride goes before a fall. You can't win 'em all. Don't be a willing victim. Kill or be killed. Go down fighting. The next world is a very nice place; there are no bandits there.</p> <p>In effect it is the philosophy of the judo mat. And Donovan was a black belt. The tenets of Zen are so amorphous, as much about what they're not as what they are, you are in danger of ballsing up any attempt to verbalise them. The original Buddha, bless him, never wrote anything down, he just sat there minding his own business until he was good and ready to go public with whatever part of his tangled web he was weaving. This probably accounts for the plethora of bastardised versions that prevailed in the 60s, vapid souls who imagined their personal path to enlightenment lay in expanding their self-consciousness, babbling about their innermost f-f-f-feelings and being bloody rude to everyone with their home truths.</p> <p>What was so difficult to assimilate was the yin and yang of it, the balance: the pesky fact that we are all huge bundles of contradictions, polarised monsters whose backs are always exactly and invariably as broad as our fronts.</p> <p>Top and bottom, though, it means we're supposed to try to be good. According to Diana, this was Donovan's avowed intent. He just wanted to be a good man, to help and not hinder his fellows. He would also argue ad nauseam with himself and with anyone who'd listen about the meaning of good. \"He could,\" Diana said with something akin to maternal pride, \"tie you in knots.\"</p> <p>Donovan was never ostentatious about his Buddhism. So far as Diana ever knew in their 28 years together, he didn't meditate so you'd notice, nor did he light incense sticks and make a song and dance at an altar, chanting and what have you. Every evening, though, he went to the Budakwai to practise his judo and just be in a safe place, nobody asking him to account for himself, a man among other men trying to up the grade of their judo belts, trying, literally, to better themselves. White belt, yellow belt, green belt, brown belt, black belt; all very Mickey-Mouse on the face of it, but it took hard work and dedication. </p> <p>The hierarchic structure of his chosen discipline made sense to him so there is no paradox in the fact he was politically Conservative. He adored Margaret Thatcher. His portrait of her owes something to Annigoni's highly romanticised painting of the young Queen Elizabeth; noble, heroic, yawningly portentous. He enjoyed her company and, unsurprisingly, she enjoyed his. He had all her party political broadcasts with no hint of cynicism. They got on together like a house on fire; the grocer's daughter and the lorry driver's son, escapees of obscurity, subscribers to the principle of \"If I can do it so can you and if you can't you have only yourself to blame.\"</p> <p>Donovan's value system was founded, like Thatcher's, on the Protestant work ethic, which is all the more potent for being tacit. Work hard, and you get rewarded; idle, and you don't. Pure pragmatism. Donovan had no patience with lazy students in his teaching days. Right, he'd say, anybody not feel like buckling down, sod off out of it. As the 70s and 80s dripped by and his profession was over-run with would-be Donovans, his scorn was boundless. Look at them, he'd say, running off 90 rolls of film in the hope that one of them will have a picture on it. Not one of them has seen the inside of a darkroom and most of the buggers don't know how to load a fucking camera. And he was right.</p> <p>There is nothing morally wrong with having the Midas touch in Zen ideology. In a way you're duty bound to make as much loot as you can so that you can redistribute it where it's needed. Terry would empty his pockets for anyone down on their luck, Diana says. He never passed a beggar on the street . . . Donovan made a great deal of money. His business ventures always came good and a quarter of a century spent making commercials for film and television made him a rich man by anybody's standards. His money wedge, he called it - as in \"You all right for wedge?\" - also defended him against disparagement.</p> <p>Once, while mooching around the National Portrait Gallery, he was greeted by an upper-class aesthete of his acquaintance. \"Why Terence,\" said the man, \"fancy seeing you here! I didn't know you were interested in this sort of thing.\" </p> <p>\"I'm not,\" Donovan replied, whipping out a hefty wedge. \"These are all the portraits I'm interested in.\" </p> <p>A lot of loyal friends felt that Donovan compromised his artistic integrity with so much commercial work. He always insisted he was a craftsman, not an artist. Perhaps he longed to be contradicted. His advertisements were technically brilliant, of course, they had the requisite style and punch, but they could always only be a triumph of form over content. And even a craftsman wants to say something louder than Wear Tuff Boots or Drink Guinness. His foray into feature film making was singularly unsuccessful. He made a movie about a Japanese spy in London. I haven't seen it. Very few people have. Those who had the privilege variously opine \"He was having a joke\", \"It was fantastically interesting\" and \"Crap\". Donovan had no option but to shrug it off. \"I believed in it,\" was all he ever said. He did not invite sympathy, nor did he get much. </p> <p>It is considered axiomatic that a man who gives the impression of being completely in control of himself is somehow immune to the anguish of disappointment. Particularly if he has a sense of humour. There was an unseemly hoo-ha, for instance, over his Robert Palmer promo. For this effort he gathered together a tribe of his favourite models, the thin but bosomy types who precursed the supermodel, dolled them up in next to nothing and had them zombying about like a bunch of identical, porny automatons. By way, I imagine, of ironic comment upon the socio-sexual mores of the pop scene. How would I know? At all events, those more deeply entrenched thereabouts than I took a certain umbrage. Surely this was insulting to women? Not only were they showing their bits, they were clearly inept musically since they weren't really playing their guitars. It was rather as though Donovan had taken it upon himself wilfully to pimp the wretched promo. Then the supreme irony came as various seedy entrepreneurial hopefuls began their moves to book the backing group, which was nothing if not unconsciously Zen of them.</p> <p>When Donovan decided to return to still photography, he found that art editors, like policemen, had become absurdly young. \"They've never heard of me,\" he confided to his peers. \"Or the Beatles. What a load of wankers.\" But he had been right all along. These really were the 90s. During their course he privately - intensely privately - took himself back to the drawing board and embarked on the process of becoming what he always said he wasn't, an artist. As though laughing at himself before anyone could get a snigger, he was overtly shy and wry about it, but obsessive, earnest, perfectionist. They're all in storage now, packed away in a warehouse somewhere with their faces to the wall, evidence of years spent trying to nail his concept of Japanese art to his own flag-pole.</p> <p>Perhaps he had chosen, at the unpromising hour of mid-life crisis, to take himself back to the original passion of the lonely, teen-aged boy who wanted to be a Samurai warrior, to focus finally on the place inside himself he liked the best and cut out the middleman of technology. Diana Donovan remembers the day he sold a painting. It hadn't been for sale, none of them was, but an acquaintance saw it, liked it, wanted it and a deal was struck. It's a funny thing, Diana said, but she had never seen him so thrilled to have earned money in his life.</p> <p>In 1996, the year of his death, he was working for the glossies again, bad-mouthing picture-desk wankers and generally doing what came naturally. In his spare time he keyed in his word processor to capital letters and began to write. He planned a series of vignettes, apparently, to expose his thought processes to a wider public and have a bit of a laugh. In one of them, which he has archly entitled The Curious Power Of Yellow, he rails against the complacency with which the British have allowed their beautiful cities to be fouled up by madmen who rush about scribbling ugly yellow lines on our lovely streets. What has happened to our British fighting spirit? Are we fit only to be footie-drunks? Why aren't we ashamed not to be more like the French, who boldly put a stop to vehicle clamping by the simple expedient of roughing up the clampers in the first week of their incarnation and throwing their stupid gadgets into the Seine? </p> <p>Another heart-cry centres upon the freedom and ease with which middle-class Englishmen abuse women. The abuse he pinpoints is the mindless, aggressive \"joshing\" manner with which certain \"pink-faced twits\" who are not \"secure in their souls\" make derogatory personal remarks to pretty girls who don't know how to defend themselves. Then, with Samurai precision, he outlines the remedy for this offence of offences. What you do, he wrote (in capital letters), is this . . . Place the left hand firmly on the back of the abuser's neck. With the finger and thumb of the right hand firmly grip the windpipe. And pinch.</p> <p>The abuse, he concludes with the penchant for overstatement possessed of all keen amateurs, \"WILL STOP WITH A SLIGHT GURGLE AND NEVER OCCUR AGAIN\".</p>",
  "<p>Once, it was imported Pyrenean and salt marsh lamb that made chefs swoon. Now, it is Scottish North Highland Fine Lamb (NHFL, 01863 766505) that gets rave reviews from the likes of Michel Roux, Rowley Leigh and our very own Jeremy Lee. </p> <p>The overheated kitchens of the capital's top eateries are a world away from the heartbreakingly beautifulheather moorland of the Strath Of Kildonan, a remote corner of remote Sutherland. There, you have to scan the landscape for the white dots that are these celebrated sheep. Blink, and you'll miss them. The term \"free-range\" just cannot do justice to these creatures - they have the outdoor lifestyle of wild animals and, to all intents and purposes, would qualify as game were it not for the fact that they can be herded by dogs. They walk dozens of miles each day, drinking spring water and seeking out their favourite feed, ling, bell heather, lungwort and cottongrass being just a handful of species in the rich plant mix that is their birthright. </p> <p>Birthright? Yes, these sheep have an impeccable pedigree. They are traditional breeds: the positively Alpine neat little Blackface or the short North Country Cheviot. They come from closed flocks that have been registered on the same estates for more than 100 years, with no cross-breeding for bigger, faster-growing animals. In shepherding terms, they are \"hefted\", or acclimatised, to their location and won't stray. That means that even if you herded them into a van and dumped them in Inverness, they'd more than likely find their way back home. </p> <p>That home is majestically scenic, but also tough and inhospitable, and only these breeds have the survival skills to hack it up here. With its short summer and harsh winter, the environment makes for slow growth, which is why the first \"new season\" NHFL is six months old when killed, while the bulk of the output is in much older lamb, known as hogget, or even mutton, at 18 months or so. </p> <p>It is how you would hope all lamb is reared. Dream on: most of it is from sheep cross-bred for quick growth, reared mainly indoors, fed concentrated animal feed, fattened in muddy fields and despatched to our plates in a rapid three months. That, unfortunately, is the way the lamb market is going. By 1999, the market price of sheep was at an all-time low, putting farmers under pressure to cut costs and get their lamb to table as quickly as possible - or give up entirely. These days, farmers increasingly view sheep as little more than expensive lawnmowers. </p> <p>All of which leaves consumers with no way of knowing whether their lamb is from a do-it-right farmer or a do-it-fast farmer, since it is generally sold as one undifferentiated category, country of origin being the only distinguishing feature - a ridiculously rudimentary state of affairs, since traditionally reared, mature lamb tastes as different from most fast-growth stuff as wild salmon does from farmed. Or is that just whimsy? </p> <p>Out in the glens, it was easy to be persuaded of the notional advantages of this Sutherland lamb. Back in my kitchen, a tasting confirmed the romantic prejudice. I pitted some NHFL cutlets (out of the farmer's freezer and defrosted negligently in the car boot) against some freshly-bought cutlets from an upmarket multiple. Tasted blind, the unanimous preference was for the Sutherland lamb. The multiple's lamb was tougher, watery and comparatively devoid of flavour, while the NHFL cutlets were exceptionally tender, with a deeper, sweeter more aromatic character. No contest. </p> <p>The impetus behind NHFL, a venture launched by farmers Michael Wigan and Charlie Brooke, is to introduce a location-based brand into the market that consumers can latch on to, and so create sales for sheep reared in a traditional manner but to strict production standards. \"The quality and taste of our meat is the only thing we've got going for us,\" says Wigan. \"We want to get recognition for the quality of meat, not just see it disappearing in a supply of mass-produced 'Scotch' lamb.\" </p> <p>Working so closely with chefs for whom the quality of raw materials is almost a religion, Wigan and Brooke have also had to ensure that there is no weak link in the production chain. In winter, when natural feed has to be supplemented, the sheep are given home-grown hay and silage, never bought-in concentrates. When they are ready for fattening, they are moved on to coastal farms and fed turnips until they have just enough, but not too much, fat. A short journey takes them to the slaughterhouse in Inverness, without being traumatised. Hanging for at least seven days or more ensures that the meat stays tender. So, what princely sum does this formidable lamb attract? A very reasonable average \u00a34 a pound - and it's delivered to your door, to boot. Here's hoping that more beleaguered sheep farmers follow this precedent - in droves. </p> <p> All recipes serve six. </p> <p><strong> Lamb sweetbreads with peas, almonds and mint</strong></p> <p> <strong> 280g lamb sweetbreads </strong></p> <p><strong>Vegetable oil, for frying </strong></p> <p><strong>1 clove garlic </strong></p> <p><strong>20g whole blanched almonds </strong></p> <p><strong>40g shelled peas </strong></p> <p><strong>30g unsalted butter </strong></p> <p><strong>8 fresh mint leaves, chopped</strong> </p> <p>Put the sweetbreads in a colander and place under running cold water for an hour, to rinse off all impurities. Place a pan of water on a high heat and, when boiling, drain the sweetbreads and drop them in the pot. Stir and cook for a minute only. Drain in a colander, lay the sweetbreads on a tray and cover with another that is weighted down. Leave for half an hour, until they have cooled. Peel the sweetbreads, removing only the little pieces of fat and membrane adhering to the outside. Cook the peas in boiling water seasoned with salt and a little sugar. Finely chop the garlic and chop the almonds very small. </p> <p>Heat a heavy-based frying pan. Put a spoonful of flour on a plate, add salt and milled pepper, toss the sweetbreads in the flour and shake off any excess. Pour in enough oil to cover the bottom of the pan and lay in the breads in one layer. Once they have turned a pleasing gold, turn and add the garlic/almond mix. Cook for a three to three to four minutes, until golden brown. Add the butter and peas, raise the heat, add the mint and adjust the seasoning. Serve at once. </p> <p><strong> Roast leg of lamb in the abruzzi manner</strong></p> <p> The milk of the sheep of Abruzzi region is used to make Pecorino. It is unlikely that you'll get authentic Italian lamb in the UK, but this manner of cooking can be emulated with our own produce, as long as it's top quality.</p> <p><strong> 1 2-2.3kg, leg of lamb, boned and butterflied </strong></p> <p><strong>5-6 cloves garlic </strong></p> <p><strong>Sea salt </strong></p> <p><strong>A fully-charged pepper mill </strong></p> <p><strong>3 tbsp good olive oil </strong></p> <p><strong>900g good waxy potatoes </strong></p> <p><strong>2 small sprigs rosemary</strong> </p> <p>Ask your butcher to prepare the meat for you. Preheat the oven to 225C/ 425F/gas mark 7. Peel the garlic, cut it into thick slivers and insert into the flesh of the lamb. Liberally season the meat with salt and pepper. Peel the potatoes, cut them into 2.5cm dice and rinse under cold water. </p> <p>Heat a big roasting tray in the oven. Remove the tray from the oven, pour in the oil, lay the lamb in the bottom and surround it with the potatoes. Put the tray back in the oven and, after five minutes, reduce the heat to 160C/325F/gas mark 3, and scatter salt and pepper over the potatoes. Push the rosemary into the meat, and scatter a few leaves among the spuds, then turn the meat and potatoes over. Cook for another 20 minutes, then transfer the lamb to a serving dish. Return the potatoes to the oven until crisp, then tip them and all the cooking juices into the serving dish and take the lot to the table. (In Italy, they sprinkle grated Pecorino over the spuds - by all means do the same, as long as you can get hold of the good stuff.) </p> <p><strong> Rack of lamb with mustard and parsley crust</strong></p> <p> Old-fashioned and brilliant.</p> <p><strong> 3 racks lamb, with 18 chops in total </strong></p> <p><strong>1 big handful flat-leaf parsley </strong></p> <p><strong>2 big handfuls white breadcrumbs </strong></p> <p><strong>Sea salt and fresh black pepper </strong></p> <p><strong>2-3 large tbsp Dijon mustard </strong></p> <p> Ask your butcher to chine and trim the racks. Heat the oven to 225C/425F/gas mark 7. Finely chop the parsley and mix with the breadcrumbs and seasonings. Spread the mustard over the fat on the lamb, then dip the racks into the crumb/ parsley mix - the crust should be evenly distributed. </p> <p>Heat a roasting tray and pour in a little oil. Entwine the bones of two racks, like two pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, and lay them, crust-side down, in the oil. Lay the other rack beside them. (Alternatively, lay the three racks, bones upwards, side by side.) Cook for 10-12 minutes for medium rare. Leave to sit for 10 minutes before carving. </p> <p><strong> Lamb korma</strong></p> <p> Come summertime, I get cravings for Indian food and start leafing through An Invitation To Indian Cooking, by Madhur Jaffrey, an all-time favourite.</p> <p><strong> 3 tbsp ground coriander </strong></p> <p><strong>1 tbsp ground cumin </strong></p> <p><strong>1 tbsp desiccated unsweetened coconut </strong></p> <p><strong>4 medium onions, peeled and chopped </strong></p> <p><strong>5 cloves garlic, peeled and chopped </strong></p> <p><strong>1 thumb-sized piece fresh ginger, peeled and chopped </strong></p> <p><strong>1 large tomato </strong></p> <p><strong>1 tsp ground turmeric </strong></p> <p><strong>6 tbsp vegetable oil </strong></p> <p><strong>5 whole cardamom pods </strong></p> <p><strong>6 whole cloves </strong></p> <p><strong>7 whole black peppercorns </strong></p> <p><strong>2 bayleaves </strong></p> <p><strong>1 cinnamon stick, 5cm long </strong></p> <p><strong>2 small hot red peppers (optional) </strong></p> <p><strong>1.6kg cubed lamb - shoulder, leg or, best of all, neck </strong></p> <p><strong>1 tbsp plain yoghurt </strong></p> <p><strong>2 tsp salt </strong></p> <p><strong>1 tsp garam masala</strong> </p> <p>Roast the coriander, cumin and coconut in a pan for a few minutes, until just darkened, then put to one side. Put the onions, garlic and ginger in a liquidiser, along with the tomato and turmeric, and blend to a paste. </p> <p>In a large, heavy-bottomed pot, heat four tablespoons of oil over medium flame. When it is hot, add the cardamom, cloves, peppercorns, bayleaves, cinnamon and red peppers, and stir. Add just enough meat to sit in one layer without crowding, and cook, turning, until it is a rich brown all over. Repeat with the rest of the meat. </p> <p>Tip the browned lamb and cooked spices into another pot. Return the cooking pan to the hob, add the rest of the oil and add the paste. Stir as the liquid evaporates and the paste starts to stick to the bottom. Lower the heat and stir for five minutes longer, adding a little water as necessary. </p> <p>Now add the roasted spices, and cook, stirring, for another five minutes, then stir in the yoghurt, taking care that it does not scorch. Return the meat to the pan, add salt and enough water to cover the lamb, and stir to scrape up any spice mix adhering to the bottom of the pot. Bring to the boil, then turn the heat down to a quiet simmer. Cover, and leave to cook for an hour or so. Stir in the garam masala and cook for a further five minutes. </p> <p>A few sliced green chillies, some chopped fresh coriander leaves, fried onion rings and a little ground cardamom seed are a traditional finish to the korma.

  "We are individuals as well as social beings, and open to accusations of selfishness and hypocrisy. In principle, I am opposed to capital punishment. But then I think of the people I would like to kill, and I wonder what I would do if I were minister for executions. And I realise quite what a bad idea capital punishment is. <p>Or let us take the hot issue of transport. Clearly, we need more people to use public transport. But, if I'm selfish, I can't say I'd look forward to that, because I already use it and am frequently stuck behind people who seem to be using it for the first time. Railway ticket staff operate as a counselling service, dealing with endless inquiries from inexperienced passengers: \"So the train will just stop, and I don't have to hold my hand out or wave or anything. Right. And which platform is it?... Oh, I see, it depends where I'm going. Well where are some good places to go?\" </p> <p>Then of course, there is the whole issue of road usage. Very few people want the car banned, and none of them can drive. That's merely an observation; I'm not saying you have to be guilty of something before you say it should be illegal. That would mean that you believe in one law for yourself and another for everyone else. I don't know what's worse, denunciations of dope-smoking from people who don't happen to like it, or people who secretly smoke it? And is it hypocritical or selfless for a politician to promote heterosexual marriage when his own interests clearly lie elsewhere? </p> <p>When it comes to motoring and tax, accusations of hypocrisy fly like the pickets we used to see in the happier days when the law allowed protests by people other than the self-employed. Union leaders who denounced this week's protests were, quite unjustifiably, accused of using militant tactics themselves. In fact, they sold their members out years ago. The Liverpool dockers got no more support from the T and G than they did from the hauliers. The TUC should not be denouncing others for bringing the country to a standstill, but remembering that it can be done. </p> <p> Rightwing commentators of the \"am I the only person who is heartily sick...?\" variety rage against \"union muscle\" as though union relaxation exercises hadn't replaced it. Tabloid Falangists herald a revolt by white self-employed Britain, and churn out made-up anecdotes to prove that a \"new establishment\" of gays, asylum seekers and anti-racist environmentalists now run the world and are all hypocrites. \"A taxi driver I know was driving a well-dressed millionaire teacher to a champagne reception hosted by Archbishop Desmond Tutu. There she was, banging on about cruelty to pets and he looked around, and surprise, surprise, not only was her handbag leather, but in it were the severed heads of six kittens.\" </p> <p>The right accuse those of us who advocate higher income tax of really wanting \"higher taxes for everyone else\", which doesn't even begin to make sense. I suppose it means that, although we demand properly funded hospitals and schools and redistribution of income, we ourselves would just carry on paying the old tax rate and the government would be unable to do anything about it. </p> <p>What is true is that when people call for higher taxes, they usually mean progressive direct taxes on individuals and company profits. Indirect taxation is by its nature iniquitous, and yet the EU demands VAT be charged on bridge tolls that people shouldn't have to pay anyway. And it is all very well calling for high fuel taxes if you can easily afford them. </p> <p>Certainly, our roads are congested and our health and environment are being badly damaged. But we need clean air, not dirty air that is a nice earner for the chancellor. Where are the low fares, electric buses and green diesel? Taxes aren't forcing commercial traffic (the principle cause of the problems) off the roads, and if the revenue raised is truly being used to fix the environment, then how exactly? Is the globe being cooled in some way, perhaps by slices of cucumber being placed all over it? In fact, nothing much of anything seems to be being done with the revenue. Otherwise the government could get away with raising it from fuel. </p> <p>If people thought schools and hospitals were enjoying a golden age and genuine efforts were being made to develop clean energy, it would have been easier for ministers to turn the public against hauliers and farmers. The country isn't suddenly in love with diesel fumes and pesticides in the way it once was with Diana. Fuel prices affect everybody but they are not the only factor in people's view of the world, even if they are unfair. In fact, some of those protesting this week wouldn't have been doing so if they genuinely believed that good comes from the fuel taxes they pay. They weren't all selfish rightwing bastards. Not all taxi drivers are Tories. </p> <p><br><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Think of a world without access to Anna Karenina or The Tin Drum, Madame Bovary or The Unbearable Lightness of Being. Yet Britain trails much of the Continent in translating foreign fiction; so how many more modern classics might be failing to reach us?</p> <p>According to the Bookseller, fewer than 3% of books published in Britain last year were translations - as were only 5% of the 4,500 new fiction titles. This contrasts with France, where 25% of new books are translations, and both Germany and Italy, where the figure is as high as 40%.</p> <p>These statistics no doubt reflect English's status as a global language, and the dominance of US culture. But do they also point to parochialism and insularity? The French cultural attache in London, Geraldine D'Amico, argues that French publishers seek out foreign-fiction \"not because they think it's superior but because they're open-minded. We're continental; we're used to a continuous exchange, and an awareness of sharing the same roots.\"</p> <p>Christopher MacLehose, chairman of Harvill, one of Britain's leading publishers of translated fiction, sees a tendency \"in the giant corporations to feel translation is more expensive, time-consuming and less rewarding in terms of the bottom line\". It is seen as \"paying twice\", for both author and translator. Since \"big houses can do very well in English, why bother?\" Monoglotism plays a part, given that outside readers must be paid to recommend foreign-language books.</p> <p>Yet is an expectation of low rewards self-fulfilling? Rachel Holmes, managing editor of the online booksellers Amazon.co.uk, finds no lack of curiosity on the part of readers, who devour such novels as Federico Andahazi's The Anatomist or Arturo Perez Reverte's The Fencing Master. \"It's author name recognition that matters,\" she argues. \"If publishers put money into presenting and packaging the books, they're not difficult to shift; I don't think people notice they're translations.\" Moreover, \"paperback classics, like Hugo or Dostoyevsky, sell buckets.\"</p> <p>Unexpected bestsellers give a fillip, says MacLehose: \"Each spectacular success, like [Umberto Eco's] The Name of the Rose and [Peter Hoeg's] Miss Smilla's Feeling for Snow, is followed by a spate of Italian romances or Scandinavian mysteries; publishers are sheep-like.\" Patrick S\u00fcskind's Perfume became a \"Frankfurt bookfair phenomenon\": it was \"the book you had to chase\", recalls Margaret Halton, now rights director of 4th Estate. </p> <p>There are now more translation grants for publishers, from government bodies abroad (which also furnish translated snippets), the Arts Council of England and the EU. But translators remain badly paid (the official minimum rate is \u00a370 per 1,000 words, though some publishers pay as little as \u00a325). Anthea Bell, now WG Sebald's translator, is one of few who make a living from it, but even she says: \"You can hardly live from belle lettres; you need a sideline, a specialism.\" Hers is musicology.</p> <p>Ros Schwartz of the Translators' Association has attacked a \"conspiracy in the publishing world to pretend a book hasn't been translated\", lest readers be deterred. But Peter Bush, director of the British Centre for Literary Translation at the University of East Anglia, believes this chronic lack of recognition may be changing. \"It's not thought a glamorous profession, but translators are becoming less modest; they play a key, creative role in mediation between cultures. Every translation is an interpretation; it's the closest reading of a text you can have, and it needs to be as challenging a piece of writing as the original.\"</p> <p>For Bush, a literary translation is a work of art in its own right: \"You need a consistent interpretation of the original language; it's not just about meaning.\" That leaves open the curious possibility that a translation could be an improvement. (James Thurber once remarked to a French fan that he \"did tend to loose something in the original\".) Yet Bell prefers to be \"as invisible as possible; when a reviewer makes no mention of the translation, it's a compliment; it means it's not bad or clumsy.\" She is not of the \"school who think the sheer foreignness should come through\".</p> <p>Amanda Hopkinson, the Arts Council of England's international literature officer, says: \"There's great praise for Constance Garnett, who brought the Russian greats into the anglophone world, but the drawback is they all read the same. As a good writer - and if you can't write, you can't translate - you'll have a voice, but it's like being an actor: you're a conduit for someone else's words and style.\"</p> <p>Should translations read \"smoothly\", or seek to reflect the original's stylistic quirks and innovations? Miss Smilla's Feeling for Snow exists in two very different British and US translations - both sold more than 1m copies - because, according to MacLehose, its UK publisher: \"Peter Hoeg wanted the rough and unbalanced way the sentences read in Danish; he didn't want them smoothed out. The American translation was very polished; what Peter did was unpolish it.\" The two versions are compared in a British Council website: www.literarytranslation.com.</p> <p>There may be signs of an increasing interest in translations, with agents such as Andrew Wylie handling more foreign-language authors (Viking lured WG Sebald from Harvill under his auspices). But there is much to be done. \"Millions of Britons cross European borders,\" says MacLehose. \"But it's not enough to go and drink their wine and eat their pizzas; why the minuscule number of their books in our bookshops?\"</p>",
  "<p>Ken Bates is right when he describes the sort of friendly England played against France in Paris a fortnight ago as meaningless - but only up to a point. The Chelsea chairman believes there are too many internationals anyway, yet if a country is serious about seeking success at representative level it needs more than isolated exhibition matches to give its team a better chance of competing in the major tournaments. </p> <p>After England have played their opening World Cup qualifying games against Germany and Finland in 3 weeks' they will meet Italy in a friendly in Turin in mid-November. Then there is nothing until the end of February when there will be another friendly, against Spain, at Villa Park before the qualifiers resume in March with the return match against the Finns. </p> <p>Given the piecemeal nature of an international fixture list it is a wonder at times that England ever qualify for anything. Kevin Keegan, like his predecessors, is being exhorted to give the country's emerging young talents a chance, but when a coach has just one non-competitive game to sort out his thoughts for two crucial qualifiers, on which his future as England coach may well depend, he might be forgiven for restricting the wand of youth to Aston Villa's Gareth Barry. </p> <p>Budding England footballers are in greater need than ever of a representative programme which will help bridge the gap between under-21 level and the period in their mid-20s when they are most likely to blossom as full internationals. B fixtures would be the ideal outlet but England have played little more than a dozen of these in the past 10 years. </p> <p>There is another option, one being exploited by the likes of Brazil, Italy, Spain and Nigeria, all of whom will expect to make a decent showing in the 2002 World Cup. Their young players are competing now in the 2000 Olympics and so seriously are the Italians taking it that they have put back the start of their league season until October 1. </p> <p>Under Marco Tardelli, the outstanding Juventus midfielder who scored one of the goals when Italy beat West Germany in the 1982 World Cup final, such youngsters of promise as the 21-year-old Andrea Pirlo should thrive on the Olympic experience. It is hard to believe that the international careers of, say, Joe Cole or Steven Gerrard would not have been enhanced by spending the next four weeks in Australia rather than slogging it out for Premiership points. </p> <p>The reality is that the majority of English clubs affected regard the Olympics as a nuisance and resent having to release their foreign players. England's interest in the games more or less ended with a gold medal in 1912 and the Great Britain team stopped entering when the amateur-professional distinction was abandoned in the early 70s. </p> <p>Strictly speaking the Olympic tournament should still be confined to amateurs. That idea, however, became a sham after the second world war when the Soviet Union and eastern Europe fielded teams who may not have been paid for playing football but did little else while holding jobs in the army or other state occupations. </p> <p>The outstanding Hungarian team of the early 50s, led by Major Ferenc Puskas, won the 1952 Olympic tournament and the competition was monopolised by the eastern bloc until Fifa introduced a rule in 1980 barring any European or South American player from taking part if he had previously played in a World Cup qualifier. </p> <p>For the 1992 games in Barcelona the competition became an under-23 professional tournament and four years ago, in the Atlanta Olympics, countries were allowed to include three over-age players. Thus far and no further, it would seem, since Fifa regards any further concessions as posing a direct threat to the World Cup. </p> <p>Those who believe that the Olympics should be about purely individual achievements will share the view of the Princess Royal that team sports, whether they involve professional footballers or top American basketballers, have no place in the games. Given the pulling power of football, however, this is an ideal unlikely to be fulfilled. </p> <p>As long ago as the 1956 Olympics in Melbourne the final between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia drew a crowd of 120,000 and the huge attendances for the most mundane fixtures in Los Angeles in 1984 did much to persuade Fifa to give the United States the 1994 World Cup. </p> <p>Olympic football, in other words, is not far off being a global event second only in importance to the World Cup and the fact that there is no sign of England or the other UK countries considering ways to re-enter is not encouraging for the development of international players.</p>"
