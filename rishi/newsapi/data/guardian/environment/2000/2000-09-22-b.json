  "<p>Even Iron Chancellors can bend with the wind. Gordon Brown may give the appearance of a man wedded to his economic plan, but he's not averse to a little trimming. </p> <p>The signals are that this week's party conference delegates will cheer the news that pensioners are cherished more than this year's 75p rise led them to believe. The faithful might even witness the chancellor express some humility, if through gritted teeth, following his decision to ignore fuel tax protestors. </p> <p>A petrol tax cut to match the Tory pledge of 3p off fuel duty is out of the question. More likely is a strong hint that November's green budget will include a freeze on duty, matching a pledge by the Liberal Democrats. Other tax and benefit changes are expected to be in short supply. Instead, Gordon Brown and Tony Blair will trumpet the 3.2% real increase in government spending, particularly on public services, and the booming economy. </p> <p>Whatever the chancellor announces, the Labour and Tory party conferences over the next two weeks will be true pre-election platforms which give voters a clearer idea of what will happen to the pound in their pocket. </p> <p>The Tories spent two days this week preparing their tax plans for the coming election. Little is known of the conclusions they reached, apart from the pledge to cut 3p off fuel, but their conference will be used to spell out some tax cuts and benefit changes designed to win over a public disillusioned with Labour. </p> <p>Shadow chancellor Michael Portillo has already said he won't spend more than the country earns. This limits Tory spending in its first year in office, presuming it wins the election, to an extra 2.25%. The figure is nearly a full percentage point less than Labour's spending plans, which one firm of accountants says implies a Tory spending cut of some \u00a312bn. Put another way, it suggests that Mr Portillo has \u00a312bn for possible tax cuts, but it's a figure he denies, and he scoffs at accusations that he will cut public services. Nevertheless, scaling back Labour spending to this extent would allow him to abolish capital gains tax, inheritance tax, beer and cider duties, air passenger duty and insurance premium tax in one go. </p> <p>Much of the Lib-Dems election agenda was spelled out in Bournemouth this week. It has become almost a cliche that if you like a dash of socialism with your martini, the LibDems are for you. So what are the parties promising for the pound in your pocket? Jobs &amp; Money sets out the party pledges below, but expect lots of shuffling ahead of a possible election next year. </p> <p><strong> Pensions</strong> Hopes that the Liberal Democrats would restore the link between the state pension and earnings were dashed. The party agreed to pump between \u00a35 and \u00a315 into the state pension should it win, but stepped back from a commitment to push it up every year in line with earnings. Pensioners moving through the 75 and 85 barriers will get extra payments and means-testing of savings will be abolished. </p> <p>The party also proposes a compulsory second pension \"that would guarantee a decent level of income for future pensioners\" and by that the party means people under 30 now. </p> <p>The Tories want to make life easier for pensioners, collapsing Labour's various benefit hikes into one single boost to the state pension. Longer term it wants to wean everyone off the state pension altogether, starting with the under 30s. Workers would be offered monthly cash top-ups to a personal pension in return for signing away their right to a state pension on retirement. Unfortunately, the amount of money on offer will not be disclosed until next month. </p> <p>Don't call it a privatisation, say the Tories, because it will not be compulsory. In the meantime, state pension rises will be higher than Labour, they say. </p> <p>On Thursday Gordon Brown countered with a Labour proposal that attempts to make more attractive the mix of flat rate state pension - \u00a367.50 for a single person - and means-tested benefits that most pensioners live with now. </p> <p>He repeated the offer made in the Budget of a pension credit. The government's aim is to persuade people on low to middle incomes to put their cash into a voluntary, second stakeholder pension. The pension credit, on a sliding scale, will allow them to keep their savings rather than them being offset against benefits. It will be complicated. The only simple aspect will be a minimum in come guarantee of \u00a382 from April next year that Mr Brown hinted he might raise to \u00a390 when he addresses the Labour conference. In contrast, one of Labour's main stealth taxes, the abolition of tax relief on dividend income, costs shareholders about \u00a36bn per year of which \u00a34.2bn is shouldered by pension funds. That's \u00a3200 more each worker must put in their pension fund each year to make up the difference. </p> <p><strong> Income - tax and benefits</strong> Labour trumpets the \u00a33.60 minimum wage, rises in child benefit and working families' tax credit which it says gurantees an income of \u00a3214 to a family with two children. On the other hand, most economists agree that higher rate taxpayers, especially those without children, have lost out. The \u00a324.7bn annual increase in the tax burden between 1996/97 and 2001/02 is equivalent to a rise of around 8p on the basic rate of tax. About 3p is accounted for by Labour tax hikes, 2p can be attributed to changes already imposed by the Tories and 3p from higher wages pushing people over the tax thresholds. </p> <p>The LibDems want to ditch Mr Brown's 10p tax rate and replace it with higher personal allowances, boosting them by around \u00a31,500. It reckons 1.4m people on low incomes will stop paying tax altogether. The scheme will be paid for with a new 50% tax band on incomes over \u00a3100,000. They also want to \"reconnect citizens with taxation\" with a citizen's tax contract that details how much tax has been raised and what it has been spent on. </p> <p>Conservative policy, by contrast, centres on tax cuts, though Mr Portillo famously retracted the \"year-on-year\" tax cutting pledge and replaced it with \"when it is affordable\". Income tax will be a target, along with Mr Brown's stealth taxes like petrol duty. The Tories want to ditch the New Deal in favour of a Britain Works and develop a more forceful scheme for the unemployed called Can Work Must Work that will seriously dent the income of refuseniks. </p> <p><strong> Savings and investments</strong> The Tories have made low savings levels a key issue, blaming Labour's decision to kill Peps and Tessas and introduce Isas for turning people off saving. The savings ratio, which measures savings as a proportion of income, is down by half. But critics argue this always happens in a boom period; people don't save when they feel secure, and is nothing to do with the products on offer. Labour reacted to demands for change at the last Budget when it extended the maximum \u00a37,000 limit for maxi versions of the Isa for another year. Calls for a simpli fication of the complex rules governing the Isa have gone unheeded. The maxi is a wrapper for a collection of investments including shares and unit trusts. The mini version is like a Tessa and holds cash. Mini Isas can only hold \u00a33,000 compared to the Tessa's \u00a35,000. There is a hint that some of Portillo's tax cuts will encourage saving and proposals to increase tax-free limits are likely. </p> <p>With an independent Bank of England setting interest rates, the monthly cost of a mortgage is unlikely to change much unless a pre-election spending spree by Labour is deemed inflationary and rates go up accordingly. A tax giveaway from the Tories could spark the same reaction. One of the few non-inflationary \"gifts\" a government can make is to increase the limits on tax-free saving, which is why the Tories find it attractive. People with lots of money to save are considered potential supporters. </p> <p><strong> Financial exclusion</strong> Strictly Labour turf. The party is almost certain to emphasise its plans for a universal bank and basic bank accounts for people on low incomes. The universal bank, which may operate through post offices, has met strong resistance in the banking community. Basic bank accounts without overdraft facilities have fared better. A couple of banks have launched products so far. </p> <p>But the struggle to resist the tide of niche marketing financial products is taxing the best brains in the Treasury. Banks want to put behind them days when they operated as an extension of the welfare state, offering accounts to all comers. Niche products address niche markets. Customers must now be the kind of people who will make the bank money and forcing them to provide decent services to people on low incomes is going to be an uphill task. </p> <p>The Libdems are sympathetic to the cause; the Tories have enjoyed highlighting the slow progress so far. </p> <p><strong>New Labour strategy</strong></p> <p>\u0095 With anything up to \u00a35bn more than he thought in the kitty, Gordon Brown can cut the basic rate of tax from 22p in his pre-election budget without disturbing his spending plans. </p> <p>\u0095 Massive spending on education, health, transport, the New Deal and possibly environmental causes. </p> <p>\u0095 Increase the scope of the working families tax credit. </p> <p>\u0095 Possible boost to children's tax credit (which replaced married couples allowance). </p> <p>\u0095 Increase tax free income for families under working families tax credit. </p> <p>\u0095 Blair wants to join the euro, but party deeply split. </p> <p><strong>Conservative strategy</strong></p> <p>\u0095 Wants to cut income tax and range of other taxes and duties that fall under heading of Gordon's stealth taxes - when affordable. </p> <p>\u0095 Cut 3p from petrol duty. </p> <p>\u0095 Cut tax on saving, not specific how and by how much. </p> <p>\u0095 Bring back married couples allowance boosting income of marrieds without children. </p> <p>\u0095 Increase state pension - not known by how much. Pledge to go one better than Labour. </p> <p>\u0095 Set against joining euro in next parliament, so pound is safe in your pocket.</p> <p><strong>Liberal Democrat strategy</strong></p> <p>\u0095 10p tax rate on first \u00a31,520 of taxable income to be reduced to zero. </p> <p>\u0095 New top rate tax of 50p on taxable income over \u00a3100,000. </p> <p>\u0095 Rises in state pension between \u00a35 and \u00a315 coupled with a compulsory second pension funded by the government if unable to pay. </p> <p>\u0095 Shift duties from \"wealth creating\" goods and services to undesirable ones that pollute. </p> <p>\u0095 Minimum wage for everyone over 16 rather than 21. </p> <p>\u0095 Want to join the euro, saying goodbye to the pound in your pocket.</p>",
  "<p>If you thought Swiss bank accounts were exclusively the preserve of multi-millionaires, African dictators and crooked tycoons looking for somewhere to stash their ill- gotten gains, then think again. </p> <p>Credit Suisse, Switzerland's second biggest bank, this week attempted to dramatically beef up its presence in Britain with the launch of a new online investment and banking service. It is targeting the 7m people it dubs the UK's \"new affluents\". </p> <p>Credit Suisse's Global Investor Portfolio account, which goes live next month, will allow people to trade shares on 15 stock markets including London, New York and Frankfurt, hold cash in up to four currencies and buy unit trusts from leading-name companies. Personal fi nancial advice will be available to customers from next year. </p> <p>It's the sort of service that in the past would only have been available to extremely wealthy investors via traditional private banks or investment managers, but Credit Suisse says it will not be restricting the account to the seriously rich - it is targeting people with around \u00a330,000-plus of \"invested assets,\" and has set the minimum needed to open an account at \u00a3600. </p> <p>The numbers of so-called \"higher net worth\" individuals are expanding rapidly - Credit Suisse reckons that across Europe there are 40m of them - so it's no wonder that growing numbers of institutions are trying to find new ways to hook the newly wealthy. Earlier this year banking giant HSBC and stockbroker Merrill Lynch joined forces to launch a similar online banking and investment services company aimed at those with \"investable assets\" of \u00a360,000 to \u00a3300,000. The company is due to go live in the UK before the end of the year. </p> <p>So what can higher net worth individuals currently get for their money? And what about the millions of not-so-high net worth people with just a few thousand pounds to invest. What should they do? </p> <p> <strong> \u00a31,000:</strong> If this is all the savings/investment cash you've got, you're really looking at a bank or building society account. However, you don't have to put up with a derisory rate of interest, particularly if you're prepared to take to the internet. Nationwide building society's e-Savings account -operated online as part of its FlexAccount current account - pays 7% gross from \u00a31. </p> <p> <strong> \u00a33,000: </strong> You should be looking at putting some of this money into a cash Isa (you can invest up \u00a33,000 in one of these during the current tax year). </p> <p> <strong> \u00a35,000: </strong> \"At this point you can start looking at equity-linked Isas,\" says Maxine Harvey at Wolverhampton-based independent financial adviser Torquil Clark. These are often invested in unit trusts or investment trusts - funds into which investors pool their money so it can be invested on their behalf by a fund manager. However, first make sure you've got some rainy-day savings in a bank or building society account. </p> <p>Meanwhile, an account with private bank Cater Allen (part of the Abbey National group) can be opened with a minimum of \u00a35,000. Funds can be held in sterling, US dollars or euros. </p> <p> <strong> \u00a310,000:</strong> Those with this sort of amount will probably want to dabble further in stocks and shares Isas (you can invest up to \u00a37,000 this tax year), but may also want to look at a unit trust or an Oeic (open-ended investment company) on top, says Ms Harvey. For wealthier investors, basic portfolio management services start at around \u00a310,000 - Rothschild Asset Management will select funds for you and send half-yearly reports for a 1.5% annual fee. </p> <p> <strong> \u00a320,000: </strong> In addition to Isas and unit trusts/Oeics, you might want to stash some money away in something like a with-profits bond. These are offered by insurance companies, and your money is invested in a broad range of shares, gilts and property. They tend to be aimed at people with at least \u00a35,000 to invest and are very much a medium- to long-term investment that should be held for at least five years. A well-heeled investor with \u00a320,000 to play with may want to move up to directly held shares with an advisory investment service from a broker such as Killik &amp; Co. </p> <p> <strong> \u00a350,000:</strong> Once you've made full use of your Isa allowances, perhaps bought into a unit trust or two and maybe acquired an insurance company bond, you might want to start to think about some more diversification - perhaps into the US. </p> <p> <strong> \u00a3100,000: </strong> At this point you may well want to look at specialising further and investing more of your loot in a particular sector or going for something like the Classic Portfolio Service operated by Edinburgh Fund Managers - this is an actively managed \"fund of funds\" unit trust investing in funds from 20 of the biggest names, says Ms Harvey (it's aimed at people who have \u00a325,000-plus to invest). </p> <p> <strong> \u00a3100,000-\u00a3250,000:</strong> Private client territory. You might want to opt for a portfolio of directly held shares and overseas investments offered by brokers such as Prudential Bache or investment manager Quilter &amp; Co. Meanwhile, Cater Allen Offshore offers a discretionary portfolio management service for clients with \u00a3250,000-plus. </p> <p> <strong> \u00a3500,000:</strong> Minimum needed to become a client of Coutts, the Queen's bank, with bespoke \"wealth management services\": one-to-one meetings with an adviser, monthly reports and entry to hedge funds. </p> <p> <strong> \u00a31m:</strong> With a million to play with, accountants KPMG will offer you a tax and strategic investment service, setting up trusts and minimising tax liabilities, with a personal adviser based in Switzerland, the UK or US. </p> <p> <strong> \u00a310m: </strong> Rothschild Asset Management will set up a private unit trust. At this level you'll want your personal investment and tax adviser, who for \u00a3100,000 a year will manage your affairs day-to-day. </p> <p>\u0095 For more information about Credit Suisse's Global Investor Portfolio account log on to <a href=\"http://www.credit-suisse.net\">www.credit-suisse.net</a></p>",

I am determined to implement it as quickly as possible so that all companies can compete fairly to deliver these revolutionary new high-speed services.\"</p> <p>Edmonds has gone back to the drawing board after admitting earlier this week that Oftel should have been firmer in its handling of the process and submitted proposals sooner.</p> <p>The announcement comes as operators' complaints over BT's behaviour reach a crescendo, with RSL Communications and Global Crossing withdrawing from the bidding process and Colt Telecom demanding a quicker roll out. </p> <p>US telecoms group WorldCom yesterday also stepped away, citing \"commercial and business reasons\", while denying any frustration with BT.</p> <p>RSL said the broadband internet market was wide open for BT, because initial access for rival operators is restricted to local exchanges. BT said it would take longer to open up urban exchanges, where competitors will be fighting for space. </p> <p>\"The regulators should be more hands-on,\" said one analyst. \"Evidence in the US shows that strong regulation is needed for this kind of thing. There needs to be more intervention from Oftel to chivvy BT along, although I understand it is a very complicated process.\"</p> <p>The \"loop\" being unbundled is the last mile of copper wires connecting homes to the network, which is then made available for broadband internet operators. Oftel said there will be full competition by 2001, but observers have poured scorn on the pace of the roll-out.</p> <p>Serafino Abape, of telecoms consultancy Ovum, said: \"European countries are completely inexperienced in dealing with unbundling, and there is no pan-European legislation offering a firm guide.\"</p> <p>BT's shares tumbled 5.7% to 746p, following a profits warning on Wednesday from Sprint Corporation of the US.</p>",
  "<p>Virgin Radio, the radio station recently acquired by Scottish Media Group when it bought Ginger Media Group, has unveiled details of its new digital strategy - a whole new internet radio network.</p> <p>The move, part of the station's plan to extend its reach to new audiences, is centred on the increasing popularity of streamed radio broadcasts to niche audiences, a strategy similar in part to that announced by competitor Capital Radio in July this year. </p> <p>Virgin Radio's strategy is being introduced in three phases. The first step is to launch a separately branded internet radio station, called Virgin Digital, in October. </p> <p>While the music content will be the same as that put out by Virgin Radio, the branding, promotions and advertising will be created entirely for a web audience, allowing the radio broadcasters to push listeners to specific online offers and develop more direct response opportunities for advertisers. </p> <p>The website is already on target to generate more than \u00a31m this year from advertising and sponsorship promotions. </p> <p>Step two is to break up the current output into four niche stations determined either by thematic strands and demographic groupings. Virgin Radio is keeping its cards close to its chest about what exactly these stations will be and what they'll be called, but says they should launch before the end of this year. </p> <p>\"The endgame is targeted music and advertising; a big step away from our current output, which is very wide,\" said John Ousby, director of Ginger Online, the digital development arm of Ginger Media Group. </p> <p>The third step involves the development of more spin-off products such as co-branded internet radio channels, building on the strategy behind the Global Sound Kitchen venture launched in conjunction with Levi's at the start of this year. </p> <p>Ousby said Virgin Radio was in advanced discussions with a number of big brands and retailers and that it would have another venture in development before the end of the year. </p> <p>Explaining the methodology behind the new strategy, Ousby said it had been on the cards for some time but it was a case of getting the whole company behind it, \"so it's not just the internet venture but the whole business of the radio station. This is an SMG project that involves all departments - from production and programming right through to sales and promotions. It's the way forward for Virgin Radio,\" he added. </p> <p>A marketing push is planned alongside the new initiatives to encourage more people in the workplace to listen to the internet radio channels - an audience Virgin Radio sees as a key untapped segment. </p> <p>Earlier this summer, Capital Radio unveiled details of three niche internet radio stations and a personalised DJ service called Kikido, which are set to launch in the coming months. Virgin Radio, however, claims to have the upper hand given its existing internet radio output is, according to auditor Arbitron Webcast Ratings, the most listened to internet radio station in the world.</p>",
  "<p>Lord Melchett's surprise victory in Norfolk crown court has run a coach and horses through Michael Meacher's patiently crafted solution for dealing with the British public's virulent opposition to genetically modified crops. Contrary to expectation, the jury cleared Lord Melchett and 27 other Greenpeace campaigners of criminal damage on Tuesday despite their own admission that they had destroyed a GM maize crop. What now lies in ruins is the government's approach of allowing farm-scale crop trials, but banning commercial growing of GM crops until the trials are complete. The verdict is a green light to protesters and signals to farmers that such is the public distrust of GM, their fields have little or no legal protection. </p> <p>What will be worrying Mr Meacher is that the ban was effectively a voluntary agreement by the seed companies. Given that the GM seeds had already got EU approval, they have every right to sell them in this country and they would have the backing of European law to do so. They sensibly know such a route would be a public relations fiasco. For the politicians, it would be a disaster, a dangerous conflation of two of the British public's pet hates: GM and Brussels. The task ahead for Mr Meacher is how to keep the seed companies on board. </p> <p>The bigger political challenge - which looks near impossible - is how to convince the British public that, at the very least, it should allow scientists the opportunity to find out what impact GM crops have on the environment. Norfolk crown court's jury showed how profound the public's unease is. There is little point arguing that this depth of feeling obviously owes much to the catastrophe of BSE, or that other agricultural innovations in the past 50 years - such as the use of pesticides - have caused far worse environmental damage. The opposition is stubborn and incidents such as the GM rape crops inadvertently planted earlier this year and then destroyed only reinforce the belief that this technology is impossible to control. </p> <p>Once again, sharply on the heels of the fuel crisis, the limits of government power have been starkly exposed by a small, committed group who can call on unexpected reserves of support among the general public. In a final irony, it was the very group that last week defied the law outside oil refinery gates, the farmers, who this week are busy asserting the rule of law.</p>",
  "The night in Belgrade belongs to the dogs - 60,000 of them now run wild because people can no longer afford to feed them. The city authorities are so broke that they frequently run out of drugs to put them down. So the dogs are clubbed to death instead. In the early morning the smell of freshly rotting rubbish hangs in the streets. <p>Yugoslavia's presidential elections take place on Sunday and the polls predict that Vojislav Kostunica, a previously unknown lawyer, will beat Slobodan Milosevic - despite the election rigging that Milosevic is famous for, and despite the fact that in Serbia nobody ever wins elections except Milosevic. But if Kostunica wins, it's likely that Milosevic will simply use the media he controls to declare victory anyway. He could do that as early as 10 o'clock on Sunday night, just two hours after the polls close and even before the polling boxes make it to the central sorting office. Welcome to Serbia 2000, where Serbs again will be left with no option but to go out on the streets. But the question is how many still have the energy left to go out and protest again. </p> <p>In the winter of 1996, 50,000 people came out to protest against the rigged local elections, and the police special forces crushed them. They were crushed again in March this year when they came out against him on the anniversary of the war in Kosovo. And on Sunday, Milosevic fights not just for his political future, but to avoid spending the rest of his life in the Dutch seaside prison where the international court in the Hague sends its guilty men. \"If we win, it will be great,\" said one of his long-time party workers. \"If we lose, they will lynch us.\" </p> <p>There are 120,000 police at Milosevic's disposal, and all holiday leave has been cancelled. They will do the job they have done in previous protests. </p> <p>On Planet Serbia, closed off from the world, hundreds of thousands of people have turned the frustration and anger of Milosevic's last 12 years of rule into hatred for both him and his wife. He has been the force behind the three bloody wars - in Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo - as he tried to use nationalism to secure his own political future. Milosevic, the puppetmaster of the Balkans, has led his people into the wilderness, turning Serbs into international outcasts. A million of them were driven from their homes in those wars, and before their eyes, Yugoslavia, once the wealthiest, healthiest and most beautiful country in eastern Europe, has shrunk from 250,000 square kilometres of sea and mountains to a violent ghetto a quarter that size. </p> <p>Milosevic will be 60 next birthday. His only vices - apart from an obsession with remaining in power - are whisky and Cuban cigars. Both he and his wife have tragic personal histories. His father, a teacher, shot himself when Milosevic was 21. His mother, also a teacher, killed herself 10 years later. But a former Yugoslav ambassador once said that \"in his presence you can feel his strength of personality. You just feel yourself shrinking down in the armchair when he begins to talk. He is a powerful man\". Richard Holbrooke, who chaired the Dayton peace talks in 1995, said he had a great sense of humour; even the waitresses in the Dayton airbase canteen were charmed by him. </p> <p>He met his wife, Mira Markovic, at school in Pozarevac. Her mother was tortured and executed by the Gestapo in 1944 as one of Tito's partisans. They have two children: Marija, a 34-year-old former journalist; and Marko, a 26-year-old former racing driver who runs his own Milosevic mafia in their home town. </p> <p>In the foyer of a Belgrade police station a nurse is trying to sort out her papers and wants to know if there are any jobs in England so she can get out of \"this madhouse\" before the elections. Behind the desk a fat, almost friendly policeman is frowning into his big yellowing ledger. He sits behind chocolate-coloured tinted glass; a full ashtray and grubby overflowing trays of carbon-copied identity papers. It's like being in eastern Europe in 1989. </p> <p>Kostunica, who presents the first real political challenge to Milosevic, is a former communist but a man with clean hands and no past. The only dirt the regime has managed to get on him is to accuse him of keeping 17 cats - which, according to an editorial in Milosevic's paper Politika, shows that, like the average cat, he is untrustworthy and selfish. The editorial also said that he is supported by \"Gays, lesbians and feminists\". </p> <p>On each of the 10 floors of my apartment block \"Gotov Je\" - he's finished - is plastered above the door of the lift. The opposition movement now claims to have 100,000 activists campaigning against Milosevic, but he is far from finished. Until election day he is fighting for his political life, primarily through the TV station he took over 13 years ago when he first came to power. </p> <p>We are watching the news in a top-floor flat. Outside, across the city's skyline, most of the damage done in Nato's 74 days of bombing has disappeared. The news begins with an eight-minute item about the reopening of the chemical plant outside Belgrade. We see a crowd of slightly distracted looking workers shouting \"Slobo, Slobo\". The next 12 minutes are election speeches from around the country with \"Slobo, Slobo\" being chanted constantly in the background. The captain of the national volleyball team calls on people to vote for Milosevic. One hour into the news and they move on to the 100,000 houses that Milosevic will build in the next 10 years. </p> <p>Sylvia, the mother of the house, stands up. \"I can't watch it. I hate him. I could kill him with my bare hands.\" She is 40 years old and has a masters degree in engineering. \"He stole the best years of my life. We have no money, my car is 13 years old. I survive by smuggling sanitary towels and chocolate from Romania. If he wins again there is no future for us.\" </p> <p>Sylvia escapes to the kitchen. The news goes on about another new electricity plant being opened; then finally there's a mention of the opposition. They are all \"fifth columnists\" and \"traitors\". The hour and 48 minutes of Milosevic propaganda mentions his name more than 40 times and ends with the news that he is leading the \"global battle against the agents of fascism\". </p> <p>Milosevic controls all the media, allowing only a few independents to preach to the converted in Belgrade. The rest of the country receive only his message, and it has worked. The latest polls say that Milosevic could legitimately poll more than 1.5m votes and Kostunica is expected to win by as few as 700,000. But Milosevic is free to fix the ballot in Serb regions of Kosovo and the sister state of Montenegro. </p> <p>His biggest supporters are among the old former communists who hark back to Tito, like 64-year-old Dorde Erdeljan and his 61-year-old wife Stava. They say they watch the news every night - never miss it. \"If it wasn't for Milosevic being so strong we would have had Nato troops on the streets of Belgrade,\" says Dorde. \"Kostunica's coalition are traitors who would betray our country.\" Instead of blaming Milosevic for the hardships of the past 10 years, they point to sanctions and a western conspiracy. \"Look at what happened in Britain over the petrol prices - your country would have collapsed in six months if you had to put up with what Serbia has been forced to suffer.\" </p> <p>The only dissenter on the street is Dobrivoic Radanovic, a 50-year-old former boxer and mechanic. \"Of course I'm voting for the opposition. The only people who won't are the old, the army and police.\" </p> <p>\"What will happen then?\" </p> <p>\"Nothing. People will protest and that will be it. The police will crush them and that will be it. We are a special people, the Serbs. The Turks ruled us and we got used to being oppressed.\" </p> <p>Jovan Dulovic works for the small independent magazine Vreme. He specialises in police affairs. \"The special intervention force can be in Belgrade in a few hours. They are the cream of the force, usually athletes and young guys who do weights. In any normal country of our size the police force should be about 30,000; here we've got 120,000. If the people keep going on the streets, the police will beat them. I don't expect them to do anything immediately - he will wait to see how the protests go. Then if they continue it will be very brutal.\" </p> <p>Milosevic is on the campaign trail, appearing at organised mass rallies. On Monday night, the TV broadcasts a ceremony showing 10,089 people gathering to join his party. Each was presented with a red rose and given 100 German marks for turning up. \"We are living through some sort of tragic comic opera which might look funny but it is very, very dangerous,\" says Lubodrag Stojadivovic, a former spokesman for the Yugoslav army who was sacked for writing an open letter protesting about political interference, especially by Milosevic's wife in the army. </p> <p>I think it is possible that the police will be used in a massive and brutal way. If that doesn't work his last card will be the army, but that is a very dangerous card to play - no matter what the generals say, the soldiers will not go against the people.\" </p> <p>The town where Milosevic and his wife began their lives looks like a pleasant place in the early autumn. All along the main street there are white banners in red letters that read \"Choose people not Nato\" and \"For Yugoslavia\". There's not a single poster or banner for the opposition in sight. The chestnut trees in the square were turning red when Markovic went there last week to address a public rally calling on her town and her nation to support her husband. </p> <p>\"Only about 2,000 people turned up,\" says Mile Yeljkovic, a journalist with Beta, the independent newsagency. \"Even those people were bused in. I heard afterwards that she was in tears, she couldn't believe there were so few people.\" </p> <p>On Sunday, and in the days that follow, Serbia will find out what they already know - that Milosevic will play God to the end. He has no choice. Perhaps that's why this city of Belgrade on this warm September day is full mostly of exhaustion and despair. \"Pandora's box has been opened and the only thing left inside for us now is hope,\" said a beautiful student, plastering opposition posters on a baker's wall. She is 19, and not so tired. </p> <p><b>Life and times of Milosevic</b></p> <p><b> Born:</b><br> August 29 1941, in Pozarevac, Serbia. Following the suicide of his father in 1962, Milosevic was raised by his mother, who also killed herself in 1973. </p> <p><b> Early years:</b> <br>Graduated in law from Belgrade University in 1964 and pursued a business career. He was chief of the state-owned gas company Technogas 1968-78, and member of the board of directors of Beobank (United Bank of Belgrade) 1978-82. </p> <p><b> Political career:</b> <br>Joined the communist party of Yugoslavia when he was 18. Entered politics in 1984. In 1987 he became leader of the Serbian communists. Elected president of the Serbian Republic in 1989. The following year he turned the League of Communists of Serbia into the Socialist party of Serbia and was returned to power in the election of December 1990. </p> <p><b> Croatia:</b><br> Serb forces bombard cities including Dubrovnik and Vukovar as the conflict escalates in 1991. Croatian independence recognised by the EC the following year. </p> <p><b> Bosnia-Herzegovina: </b><br> International recognition of the area as an independent state in April 1992 leads to civil war. Thousands of Muslims massacred by Serbs at Srebrenica in the summer of 1995. Milosevic agrees to peace in the Dayton accord in November of that year. </p> <p><b> Kosovo:</b> <br>The 1998 offensive by Serb forces against the Kosovo Liberation Army leads to the 78-day bombing of Serbia by Nato forces, March to June 1999, which ends when Milosevic agrees to withdraw his troops.</p>",
  "Given the state of road transport across Europe, it is a delicious irony that today is the first continent-wide \"car-free day\", when we are encouraged to leave vehicles at home. Thirteen of the European Union's 15 members signed up and a 14th, the Netherlands, is holding its own car-free day on Sunday. The odd man out is - no surprises - the United Kingdom. <p>After recent events, the government may think abstention wise, though local authorities are taking part. But its curmudgeonly approach to the politics of the environment has not helped build support for fuel duties as part of any wider transport strategy. When the dust settles, transport in the UK will still be on an unsustainable course. </p> <p>Even with July's \u00a3180bn plan for transport in place, road traffic is to grow 17% over the next decade. Transport is the fastest-growing source of carbon dioxide emissions, a principal cause of global warming. Inner cities will not meet national air quality standards by the target date of 2005, even if the spending plan is implemented. </p> <p>The UK also lags in terms of car use, in spite of a relatively low level of car ownership. As the table shows, all EU countries depend on cars. But the UK has the highest level of car use (88%) and the lowest level of public transport use (12%), expressed as a share of motorised passenger transport (ie excluding cycling and walking). Italy by contrast has the highest per capita car ownership but the lowest car use (76%). </p> <p>Gordon Brown will have to offer a palliative to motorists. Cutting vehicle excise duty for the smallest, most fuel-efficient cars would be more consistent with the environmental commitments and more socially progressive than cutting fuel duty. </p> <p>Yet above-inflation increases in fuel duty between 1996 and 1999 did save the emissions of between 1m and 2.5m tonnes of carbon per year - a significant contribution to the UK's promise to cut greenhouse gas emissions overall by 12.5% and CO&lt;-&gt;2 <!----> emissions by 20%. The royal commission on environmental pollution argues that greenhouse gas emissions will have to be cut by 60% by the middle of this century to avoid the worst effects of climate change. </p> <p>As a lump sum annual payment unrelated to use, vehicle excise hits low-income rural motorists hardest. Although there is now a lower rate of duty for small-engine cars (and there will be four rates based on CO&lt;-&gt;2 <!----> emissions for new cars from March next year), the current differential is too small to influence purchasing decisions and produce any significant carbon savings. The small-engine and most fuel-efficient cars could pay less than \u00a3100 - perhaps as little as a \u00a310 administrative fee for vehicle registration - and gas-guzzlers could pay more than the current rate of \u00a3155. </p> <p>For the longer term, our European neighbours have much to teach us, though all are struggling with traffic congestion and pollution. The commission for integrated transport, an advisory body established by the Blair government, has been asking how others manage to have a lower level of car dependence often with a higher level of car ownership. </p> <p>In summary: they have given a higher priority to walking, cycling and public transport, including fare subsidies. They have also used their planning systems more effectively to reduce people's need to travel distances. The UK meanwhile has given way to urban sprawl and out-of-town developments, cut back on investment and subsidies for public transport, and neglected the needs of pedestrians and cyclists. </p> <p>Praise, then, for the latest transport plan, which seeks to reverse the long-term under- investment in public transport, particularly rail. Even so, it falls short. Its proposals on buses are modest; bus market share will fall. Except in London, where there is a good combination of network planning and competitive tendering of bus services, local authorities will be hamstrung by their inability to plan services and subsidise fares. While local transport has otherwise done relatively well out of the plan, there is insufficient emphasis on walking and cycling, the most egalitarian and environmentally sustainable ways to travel. In Germany, which has higher per capita car ownership but lower car use than in the UK, 10% of journeys are made by bicycle compared to 2% in Britain. </p> <p>Another area where other European countries are ahead is car clubs as an alternative to private car ownership. You join a club owning a range of vehicles that are parked in the neighbourhood and can be hired by the hour as and when needed. It removes the incentive to use the car because of the huge up-front investment in owning one. </p> <p>Thousands of car club members in Switzerland and Germany have reduced their car use on average by about half and instead walk, cycle and use public transport more. The first commercial car clubs in the UK, in Edinburgh and Oxford, have yet to reach the critical mass of membership necessary to make them take off. A helping hand from the state could make the difference. </p> <p>Above all, the government needs to build a popular agenda around environmentally sustainable and socially inclusive transport policies. In the past week it has paid the price of failure to do so. A small minority with an axe to grind has been able to hijack the agenda because of the passive support of the majority who one way or another do not think the government is doing enough. </p> <p>Tony Grayling is a member of the Institute for Public Policy Research's sustainability team <a href=\"mailto:t.grayling@ippr.org.uk\">t.grayling@ippr.org.uk</a></p>",
  "Edited extracts from Charles Kennedy's speech in Bournemouth yesterday: <p>Potentially, politics is at a crossroads. We saw that last week. The opinion polls have recorded that this week. That's been the backdrop for this, I think, one of our most successful conferences ever. Politics is about leading. But politics is also about listening. The events of the past 10 days, have demonstrated, graphically, that the current government, neither leads nor listens enough. </p> <p>People want a better level of political dialogue. Just look at the crime debate. Ann Widdecombe and Jack Straw. They're competing in a dismal Dutch auction. Going for lowest common denominator politics. Over-claim. Over-blame. Over-reach. Undermine the entire point of the political process along the way. </p> <p>Let me be quite clear. I'm not one of those who believe that all Britain's problems began on the first of May 1997. But Labour's poverty of ambition is quite remarkable. With a parliamentary majority - of 179, they behave like John Major did - with a majority of three. </p> <p><b> Ethical</b><br> </p> <p> It's all about what will play well in the opinion polls. Britain was promised an ethical foreign policy. Britain demands legislation on the arms trade. But instead we get arms sales to Indonesia. </p> <p>And all too often, they seem scared of their own shadows. Remember that leaked prime ministerial memo? What was it he said? \"A sense that the government ... are somehow out of touch with gut British instincts\". </p> <p>So I ask you, Labour voter last time, maybe for the first time was it? Did you believe, that things could only get better? And have they? Millions of people believed it. Millions of people are disappointed. </p> <p>The Conservatives won't improve these things for you. But the Liberal Democrats can. We can improve a lot on Labour. They are continually terrified to be called the party of boom and bust. That old Labour habit of splashing out in their first years in power, and then having to cut back at the end. Gordon Brown certainly hasn't done that. He's cut back and now he's splashing out. Bust followed by pre-election boom. We said that wasn't good enough. I'd like to think he saw the light. But the truth is, he felt the heat. </p> <p>Now what of the Conservative party? Today, I want to address the millions of previous Conservative voters, who feel that William Hague's party offers them - nothing. I share many of the values, the beliefs, the concerns, of the people who used to be called One Nation Conservatives. Tolerance, decency, fair play. </p> <p>If you believe in those things, and you look at your party. And it's not got room any more, at the top table, for the likes of Ken Clarke, Michael Heseltine, Chris Patten. Then your party's got no room for you. </p> <p>To you, I say this. You have friends in the Liberal Democrats. Come and talk to us. You will be very, very welcome. What's gone wrong with the Conservative party - oh, so wrong - is not even so much the individuals, it's the issues and the instincts which today guide William Hague's Conservative party. </p> <p>William jumps in with both feet, in the wrong place, at the wrong time, and for the wrong reasons. Desperate for a headline, desperate for a quote. Desperate to get attention. He's the world's first unpopular populist. </p> <p>So how come the Tories have come up in the polls? I know the answer. It's not William's popularity. It's the people round about him that the country's warming to. It must be John Redwood, Michael Portillo and Ann Widdecombe the country loves. </p> <p>Just look at what William's been up to this year. January -patient's guarantee. Ditched. February - tax guarantee. Ditched. March - the moral case for low taxation. Ditched with the tax guarantee. April - bogus asylum seekers. May - Romsey. June. He was quiet in June. Perhaps he had a 14-pint hangover. Or perhaps it was that Romsey hangover. </p> <p><b> Record</b><br> </p> <p> Remember their record? Recessions. Crime doubled. Larger class sizes. Fewer nurses. Pensions slashed. Interest rates - through the roof. Arms to Iraq. BSE. Cash for questions. Sleaze. It must never, ever, be allowed to happen again. </p> <p>William Hague is not the serious leader of a serious political party. That's the serious point. We are serious. Our pur pose is here in this document. It's the F word. Freedom. That's why we're in politics. We want politicians to promote freedom for all. So people can make the most of their lives. I am determined we will get our message across. </p> <p>But as part of that, it is vital, absolutely vital, that we persuade people, that for every area where government can do more, there's an area where government should be doing less, or doing different. </p> <p>We would scrap a range of regulations, that burden small businesses. We will cut bureaucracy in schools. </p> <p>Tax and spend? Every party taxes and spends. But our priorities, are the people's priorities. That's what freedom means. It's not left of Labour. It's not right of Labour. It's ahead of Labour. </p> <p>It's also honest. Where there is a cost, we say how we will pay for it. Saying that if necessary, we will pay for better schools, by asking everybody to pay just 1p more on the basic rate of income tax. And to fund decent pensions, we will ask those fortunate enough to earn over \u00a3100,000 per year, to pay a little more. </p> <p>On health: Nurses and doctors - more of them. Prescription charges - abolish them. Eye and dental check-ups - free once again. Schools and colleges, cut class sizes for all 5 to 11 year olds. Abolish tuition fees for higher education. </p> <p>And what about the pensioners? Forgotten and insulted by Gordon Brown. So we will give pensioners more, above inflation. \u00a35 extra every week for every pensioner, If you're over 75, it's going to be \u00a310 extra. If you're over 80, it's going to be \u00a315 extra. Now that will make a real difference. </p> <p>We say that a clean environ ment relates to health. To poverty. To transport. To education. To civil liberties. We understand that, instinctively so. And again, we're honest. We're clear, fuel taxes should be used, to improve the environment. In the months and years to come, we have got to get that message across. Positive gain, not pain. </p> <p><b> Single currency</b><br> </p> <p> And let me say something about the single currency. As pro-Europeans we are not in favour, of rushing into the euro head first. </p> <p>We don't believe Europe is perfect. And we will work to see that reform takes place. But we do believe that Britain can and must lead in Europe. Lead reform in Europe. </p> <p>That's why, earlier this year, I asked a panel of experts, to report on what the government should be doing. And if the government chooses to ignore the experts, British businesses will lose, British workers will lose, British consumers will lose. So those of us in favour of the euro, must go out there and argue the case. We cannot sit on our hands. </p> <p>This has been an outstanding year for the Liberal Democrats. The local elections - our biggest ever share of the national vote. Sandra's triumph in Romsey. At the next election, I believe we will win more votes, and more seats. 1997 was a staging post. It wasn't a high water mark. </p> <p>So we must go into the next election, and tell people about our message of freedom.

  "<p>Shipbuilding is to consolidate its return to Birkenhead after almost a decade as Cammell Laird is poised to win a multi-million contract to build six roll-on roll-off ferries for the armed forces. </p> <p>The deal could throw a lifeline to Belfast's stricken Harland &amp; Wolff. </p> <p>Last night Harland confirmed that it will lay off 600 employees, half its core workforce, because of lack of work and cashflow problems caused by an outstanding \u00a3133m legal claim against a Texan oil company. </p> <p>But the Belfast yard, a key Northern Ireland employer and the industrial icon that built the Titanic, could win work under the \u00a31bn, 20-year Ministry of Defence contract for the ferries. The order, according to sources, will be awarded next month to a consortium of a Danish shipping group, Maersk, and Cammell. </p> <p>The MoD and Ulrik Brandt, managing director of Maersk's UK business, said no decision had been made but several sources indicated that the order, under the private finance initiative, would be announced on October 25 in favour of Maersk-Cammell. </p> <p>There has been ferocious lobbying by four consortiums and local politicians since the bidding process was reopened in June on speculation that the work would go to Germany. </p> <p>Cammell, which was revitalised through ship repair work, recently expanded its Birkenhead yard which is now building two car ro-ros for a Norwegian group. </p> <p>Mr Brandt said Cammell would build the six MoD ferries on the Mersey and in the North-east - most likely at its Tyneside yard at Hebburn. </p> <p>Harland, which said it was linked to two of the four consortiums, could share some of the work if Maersk wins. It is completing work on two oil rigs but has no big orders to occupy the 1,200-plus workforce. </p> <p>Last week an arbitration tribunal awarded Harland \u00a321.8m in settlement of a dispute with Global Marine of Texas. The Belfast company is still claiming \u00a3133m for excess costs caused by alleged changes to specification. </p> <p>The firm, which failed to win Cunard's contract for a new Queen Mary in March, said redundancies were necessary to meet financial problems which prevented it winning orders. </p> <p>The news provoked union anger, with the GMB demanding government intervention to support British yards.</p>",

  "Has Michael Portillo completely lost the plot (Portillo offers Mondeo Man 11p a day, September 21)? Years ago, the Tory government rightly started putting up fuel prices in response to worries about global warming, caused mainly by rising carbon dioxide emissions. <p>It is true that new cars are emitting less noxious exhaust gases than older cars, but they certainly are not emitting any less carbon dioxide. And since everyone is driving around a lot more these days, and car ownership is also on the up, CO2 levels are rising inexorably. </p> <p>By offering to cut petrol tax by 3p a litre because cars are getting cleaner, Portillo irresponsibly perpetuates the myth that the only problem with too many cars is bad air quality. <br><b>Richard Evans </b><br> London </p> <p> </p> <p>\u0095 Every motorist can get a 3p cut in the price of a litre of petrol, without having to risk electing a Tory government.

This is also better for air quality and safer for other road users. <br><b> Conrad Cork </b><br> Leicester </p> <p> </p> <p>\u0095 Three pence per litre off petrol tax, we are told, would deprive the Treasury of \u00a31bn a year, with a meagre return to the motorist of only \u00a33 a month and a threat of increased income tax to compensate. </p> <p>If, however, petrol tax remains high and motorists decide to reduce their spending on petrol by \u00a33 a month, where does Mr Brown get his \u00a31bn from? <br><b> Joan Skinner </b><br> Anstey, Leics </p> <p>\u0095 It was with some amazement that I read Frank Dobson's assertion (Crude exploitation, September 21) that oil companies are responsible for the current difficulties regarding fuel cost and supply.

The rationale for the high level of tax is environmental - which is justifiable. But only a small proportion of this money ends up in investment in transport infrastructure or new sustainable clean fuel technologies. </p> <p>The dilapidated state of our transport infrastructure is very evident, particularly to those visiting to the UK.

In contrast to our elected representatives, anti-GM activists understand that scientific crop trials can only ever tell us \"no evidence of risk\", not \"no risk\".

  "One of the most evocative photos of the space age shows a white-suited astronaut standing on the grey and dead surface of the moon. The visor of his helmet reflects barren surroundings and maintains his anonymity. Just visible in the reflection is the photographer, Neil Armstrong. While many people could name Armstrong as an astronaut, far fewer remember Buzz Aldrin, the subject of Armstrong's epochal image - and the second man to walk on the moon. The selectivity of fame, as it immortalises the \"first\" but becomes hazy on the \"second\", proves as fickle with the first ever spacemen. <p>The Soviet Union's first cosmonaut, Yuri Gagarin, rocketed into the collective consciousness of the world when his Vostok 1 opened the era of manned space flight in April 1961 with an orbit of the earth. But the name of his successor, Gherman Titov, who has died aged 65, is only familiar to the history books and aficionados of space flight. </p> <p>Titov piloted Vostok 2, but had also been the back-up cosmonaut to Gagarin. This meant that he had to train with, and mirror, Gagarin's preparations right up until their walk to the launch site of Vostok 1, at the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, 1,300 miles from Moscow. But Gagarin remained fit, and Titov had to wait until August 6 1961 for his turn. </p> <p>The timing of Vostok 2 was decided by Nikita Khrushchev. So great had been the global reception accorded to Gagarin that the then Soviet leader realised that, in the space programme, he had a formidable propaganda weapon. Titov's mission was therefore timed to occur just a few days before construction of the Berlin Wall was started. </p> <p>Titov's space flight lasted just over one day, in which he completed 16 orbits of the earth. He took photographs of the seas and land, blurred by the speed of his spacecraft, and, unlike Gagarin, experimented in steering the Vostok. A naturally quiet man, he was none the less elated with the experience and shouted over the radio, \"I am Eagle\" - Vostok 1's call sign - as he hurtled around the planet. </p> <p>Less enjoyable was the first manifestation of space sickness, the nausea felt by many astronauts and cosmonauts as their inner ears struggle to deal with weightless conditions. Titov was simply trying to get to sleep, and it was when he closed his eyes that the waves of sickness came over. He persisted, and by keeping as still as he could, eventually managed a healthy eight hours, 30 minutes more than that originally allocated. </p> <p>This quiet determination was characteristic of the man, and still evident in his polite reluctance to talk openly when I met him briefly in Stockholm in 1998. </p> <p>Titov was born in the village of Verkhneye Zhilino, in the Altay republic of western Siberia. His father, a language teacher, instilled in his son a love of poetry that stayed with him for the rest of his life. Many were the times he would reel off verses from memory for his fellow cosmonauts. His sophistication did not hold him back from adventure, and, in 1953, he enrolled as a aviation cadet. By 1957, he had graduated from the Volgograd Air Force Pilots Training School and, in 1960, he was selected as one of the \"six\", the Soviet Union's first group of cosmonauts. </p> <p>That Titov made it this far was all the more remarkable because of an old injury that he had nursed through hundreds of gruelling hours spent training. As a child, he has fallen from his bicycle and broken his wrist. So severe was the fracture, and in order to hide it from the officials, that he put in an extra hour of training before his scheduled gymnasium sessions to warm up his painful bones and ligaments. This steely reserve was there for all to see when, during training for Vostok, he set a record of 15 hours in the isolation tank. </p> <p>Titov never flew a second space mission, although he was selected as lead cosmonaut for the ambitious Spiral spaceplane project in the late 1960s. He furthered his qualifications and, in 1968, graduated from the Zhukovsky Air Force Engineering Academy. Spiral was a small, two-manned interceptor boosted into the upper atmosphere by a larger hypersonic aircraft. Drop tests were carried out with unmanned BOR vehicles, but the programme was cancelled in 1968. Titov also worked on the early Salyut space stations, which were essentially manned military reconnaissance platforms. </p> <p>His great disappointment was in not being able to see the prediction he made in 1965 come true: \"I myself dream of flying around the moon. Today's cosmonauts have a good chance of getting a close look at the moon.\" Alas, as the former Soviet Union crumbled, so too did Titov's dream. </p> <p>In later years, he continued to promote space flight. Then, in 1995, his career moved with the times and he entered politics. He had served as a deputy of the Supreme Soviet between 1962 and 1970, but was now elected to the lower house of the Russian parliament. Titov was married with two children. </p> <p> \u0095Gherman Stepanovich Titov, cosmonaut, born September 11 1935; died September 20 2000</p>",
  "The first time the government examined the state of its rivers, in 1866, the results in northern England were so disgusting that the civil servants made an imaginative point. <p>\"The water of the river Calder in Yorkshire makes a tolerably good black ink,\" they told MPs, \"and we have demonstrated this by using Calder water to write a small part of our report.\" </p> <p>Yesterday the Calder and its sister river the Aire, which wind through the industrial heart of West Yorkshire, won their cleanest bill of health since the time of the industrial revolution. </p> <p>The Calder, which used to be dyed orange by corduroy makers in Hebden Bridge and purple by Halifax carpet mills, now supports a thriving fishery; the Aire has seen 40 miles rescued for the two lowest grades of water quality since 1990. </p> <p>\"It has been a victory for sustained environmental pressure,\" said Kevin Grady of the pressure group Eye on the Aire. </p> <p>\"When it became clear that Leeds businesses were determined to pour millions of pounds into riverside development, they weren't going to stand for a river of froth and smells.\" </p> <p>Sir John Harman, chair of the Environment Agency, emphasised the point from his own experience as a boy. He said: \"I used to cross the Aire and Calder at Castleford and I didn't come up as high as the bridge's parapet - but the foam in the river from the wool scouring works did.\" </p> <p>Today's Aire has joined the Calder as an unexpected fishery - to the extent that expensive hotels in Leeds provide rods in rooms overlooking the waterway. </p> <p>The turning point, says Dr Grady, was the government's move in the mid-1990s to allow water rates to rise on condition that the money went exclusively to water quality improvement. </p> <p>Some \u00a360m was set aside for the Aire and Calder catchment, whose past horrors included the Bradford canal where in 1866 \"... it was found practicable to set the water on fire with a match on the end of a stick, the flame rising 6ft and running along the canal for many yards, like a will-o-the-wisp.\"</p>",
  "<p>Rivers and canals in England and Wales are probably cleaner than they have been since the industrial revolution, with 92% classed as good enough to support fish life, according to the Environment Agency. </p> <p>This 1999 figure is a big improvement on 1990, the year after water privatisation, when 85% of the 25,000 miles of rivers and canals were classified in the top two categories of \"good\" or \"fair\". </p> <p>If Scotland and Northern Ireland are included the figure is 95% in 1999, compared with 92% in 1990. </p> <p>Since privatisation, water companies have been forced by EU legislation to invest heavily in sewage treatment plants and other clean-up measures which have resulted in higher water bills but better water quality. Hundreds of miles of rivers now have fish life where there was none nine years ago. </p> <p>Rivers in the \"poor\" and \"bad\" classifications have probably been devoid of almost all life for decades, many of them in the old industrial heartlands of Britain, where chemicals used to be indiscriminately poured into the nearest stream. </p> <p>In 1990, 2.3% of all rivers were still in the \"bad\" category - meaning about 575 miles of rivers had no life - but last year this figure had gone down to 0.6%, around 150 miles. </p> <p>The biggest improvements have been in industrial areas of the midlands and northern England, where around half the rivers and canals have improved by one grade or more. The net improvement, taking into account the fact that some rivers have deteriorated over the same period, is equivalent to upgrading 40% of the total river and canal length in the midlands and north. </p> <p>The quality of rivers is one of the government's 15 indicators of \"quality of life\" in Britain, which it pledged to improve. Water companies are due to spend another \u00a37bn over the next five years making further improvements. </p> <p>The environment minister, Michael Meacher, said: \"Clean rivers are not only a vital source of water for drinking and industry, they also support a wide variety of wildlife and are enjoyed by millions for recreation. </p> <p>\"The billions being invested in cleaning up our rivers are really bearing fruit. These are the best ever water quality results, and they reflect the government's commitment to delivering a cleaner, better quality environment for everyone to enjoy.\" </p> <p>The south west of England and Wales have the highest proportion of high quality rivers, with respectively 97% and 98% of river and canal length classified as good or fair. </p> <p>The Environment Agency chairman, Sir John Harman, said: \"The survey shows real improvements in the quality of many urban and semi-urban rivers, creating real amenity for people in areas where river environments have in the past been poor, or in some cases, lifeless, polluted eyesores. </p> <p>\"However, we cannot be complacent. Around 8% of rivers in England and Wales are still graded poor or bad. Planned investment over the next five years should tackle many of these problems.\" </p> <p>\u0095 The agency has a website, <a href=\"http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk\">www.environment-agency.gov.uk</a>, where users can enter a postcode to discover the quality of rivers in their given locality.</p>",
  "An advert was run recently in the print Guardian for Solar Century, the UK solar power company devised and presided over by former Greenpeace representative and Oxford fellow Jeremy Leggett. The advert incites us to consider what may happen when supplies of carbon fuel begin to run out, what sort of blockades and panics we will suffer, what sort of squabbles at the pump. Now, the advert suggests, before it is too late, for oil supplies, and for the future of the planet, we should turn to solar alternatives. <p>Solar Century is an unabashedly commercial enterprise. Its website offers a range of solar products, from roof installations of various sizes to portable powermats. The aim of the company is to hurry the conversion to solar power in Britain, for fiscal profit. However, Solar Century also runs a charitable trust, aiming to extend solar power to those less likely to be able to afford the conversion rates, the Solar Century Global Community Trust. </p> <p>What companies such as Solar Century are aiming to demonstrate is the economic viability of solar photovoltaic (PV) power. As usual, Britain is lagging behind countries such as Japan and Germany, where government schemes have propelled rates of conversion. We remain at the level of unconverted barbarism: the Solar Century site aims to correct a few of our more primitive preconceptions. Will it work in the dark? Will it work in the clouds? The answer to both questions is, of course, yes. </p> <p>At the present time, most solar roofs are connected to the national grid. So, in the day when a surplus of electricity is generated, the excess is effectively sold to the local electricity company. At night, the local electricity network supplies the power back. Clouds interfere only slightly with the workings of solar panels. Electricity is created by daylight - cloud cover may diminish the output, but there will still be power. </p> <p>Solar Century orchestrate discussions with the local electricity companies, who are compelled by law to let customers install solar power anyway and to buy surplus electricity created by the panels. Planning permission is rarely required, unless the solar roof has been designed to project wildly beyond the frame of the house. </p> <p>Faced with these sorts of enterprises, it seems absurd that we do not, as a nation, convert instantly. Global warming, caused by carbon emissions throughout the world, but particularly in developed, industrialized countries, is no longer even a debatable probability. Its effects have already been witnessed - freak weather conditions, floods in China, El Nino storms buffeting the Atlantic coast. </p> <p>This summer the northern polar ice cap melted. Scientists respected for their rigour and precision are predicting monstrous, apocalyptic future effects, including a sea level rise of one metre, which will destroy the homes and livelihoods of, for example, 30m people living in Bangladesh, Egypt and Vietnam. </p> <p>The first recommendations from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 1990 were for a 60% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions, as the basic level required to return the planet's climate to a healthy level. Governments globally have failed to commit to anything even approaching this. </p> <p>Various dubious enterprises have been created to allow further evasion of carbon cuts for richer countries, including the carbon credits scheme, which creates a trade in carbon emission entitlements - a company which emits below its allowed level will be able to sell its surplus allowance to another. </p> <p>This once more means that money will save individuals, companies and nations from significantly altering their lifestyles. It was George Bush senior, as US president in the early days of international climate panels and conferences in the 1980s, who suavely assured the world that the American lifestyle was not negotiable. </p> <p>Now America has seen some of the worst, most destructive storms in its history: Florida devastated, Texas drought-riddled, heatwaves sweeping the midwest and the south, killing the young and the elderly. And now this year and last, an encephalitis epidemic in New York City. </p> <p>In the UK, we are more fortunate. So far, we have evaded some of the more sinister and appalling demonstrations of climate change. But we are inactive, clinging to our petrol and our cars, clinging to the core comforts of life, \"core comforts\" we have known for less than a century. There is one area in which we might act. We might, given that it is so extraordinarily easy, convert our homes to solar power. </p> <p>The use of renewable energies no longer requires individuals to adopt eccentric living patterns, to retire to the Lake District and hammer up a windmill on the top of the fell. Solar power is there for the installing, by competent, mainstream, commercially minded Oxford fellows and their team (which includes figures no less mainstream and commercial than former employees of BP). </p> <p>We scarcely have to do anything. We are not required to leave our homes, we are not required to picket or protest, to storm and rave. We are merely required to adjust our thinking slightly. To adapt.</p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.solarcentury.com\" target=\"_new\">Solar Century</a></p>",
  "The first petrol-buying panic was bad enough. The second one on Tuesday, this time sparked by rumours of blockades rather than blockades themselves, was lunacy taken to extreme. <p>Along with all the other rips in the fabric of our custom and practice that the fuel crisis produced, Britain's image is in shreds. A culture that prides itself on common sense, moderation and the ability to keep cool in a crisis finds itself racing to the pumps like Gadarene swine at the slightest hint of trouble. People who normally run on half-tanks join the hoarders and fill their cars to the brim. </p> <p>Faced with similar crises the French and Germans proved to be more reasonable than cool Britannia. When refinery blockades hit southern France and parts of the north-east two weeks ago, local petrol stations ran out but those in Paris operated as normal and there was no panic buying. Yet, by any measure other than its effect on releasing a mass psychosis, the French protests were worse than Britain's. </p> <p>The hauliers mounted real blockades, with lorries drawn up across the entrances of refineries and fuel depots, making it physically impossible for tankers to move. Contrast this with Britain's deckchair-men sitting politely on the verges. While the British government declared a phoney \"red alert\" in the national health service to try to turn the public against the protesters, the crisis in France's health system was genuinely grave. Ambulance-drivers had joined the barricades. </p> <p>One reason for France's ability to maintain its sang-froid may be that the authorities are better armed. Acting on advice from central government, the prefect of every d\u00e9partement can requisition petrol stations and order them to serve only public services such as hospitals, school buses, the police and fire brigade. The prefect can also instruct petrol stations to impose rations on private buyers. In Britain, where restraint has to be self-imposed, only a few garage managers had the common sense to do this. Most succumbed to the general selfishness and happily sold to the first comers rather than accepting the extra time and effort involved in rationing. </p> <p>In Germany the picture has also not been flattering for the British. There the fuel-tax protests targeted some refineries but mainly chose to cause chaos in town centres with crawling convoys of lorries and taxis making access impossible. As in France, the effect was localised. While Bremen, Hamburg and Magdeburg came to a standstill, other cities, including Berlin, kept calm. People did not react by panic buying. </p> <p>Beside the new phenomenon of the easily excitable British, the fuel crisis turned other things on their head. Rightwing horror of direct action evaporated while centre-left sneering about Mondeo man was shown up as crude elitism. Old industrial paradigms became hollow, and the voices at the Trades Union Congress that called the crisis a \"bosses' blockade\" sounded absurd. Many protesters were owner-drivers who only possess one lorry. Some are union members. People who denounced the hauliers as rightwing thugs of the kind who smashed through picket lines during the miners' strike should realise that some of today's lorry drivers are ex-miners. </p> <p> British hauliers are luckier than their continental counterparts. They are protected, at least to some extent, by geography. In France and Germany the fuel tax protests are only partly directed against the government. Owner-drivers and small firms are equally angry with the big haulage companies, some of which own up to 4,000 lorries and use underpaid Bulgarian and Polish drivers to trundle up and down the autobahns. In response to this unfair competition, the owner-drivers are forced to cut corners on maintenance or abandon their spare tires so as to carry more freight. No wonder that even the French Communist party, not normally known for flexibility, does not buy the line about a \"bosses' blockade\". It is demanding more concessions on fuel tax than its socialist partners in the French government have yet given. </p> <p>In part this is political opportunism, though it does show awareness that the old categories no longer fit. Opposition parties across Europe are seizing on the tax revolt to revive their fortunes. Germany's Christian Democrats, still struggling to escape from the Helmut Kohl funding scandal, are hoping to emulate William Hague by hammering the government on the tax issue. </p> <p>Tony Blair governs in an easier parliamentary climate than either Gerhard Schr\u00f6der or Lionel Jospin. They both have Green party ministers in their coalitions who insist that any relief on fuel tax does not go against environmental principles. Dominique Voynet, the French environment minister, almost resigned when the government made its first concessions. Germany's Greens are demanding that tax concessions on fuel are compensated by better conservation measures. Car commuters in Germany have long benefited from special tax relief. The Greens want the same relief for those who go to work by train, bus or bicycle. </p> <p>It was the neo-liberalism of Reagan and Thatcher that first made political hay out of the fact that producers are also consumers. Promoting deregulation in order to get government out of owning or controlling public utilities, they seduced voters by offering the untrammelled competition that results in price wars and cheaper goods and services. In an apparent paradox, by favouring sales taxes over income tax they also switched the fiscal burden on to people as consumers rather than producers. We call this conjuring trick the stealth tax, though its political purpose was clear enough. It distributed the tax burden more equally between middle- and upper-income voters and the usually non-voting poor. </p> <p>Thanks to the fuel crisis, the worm has turned. People have become aware of just how high consumption taxes are. Direct action was more successful than any debates at Westminister in getting this point across. The new multiculturalism, caused by third world immigration and unprecedented social and geographical mobility, have made people in European societies see their identities as multilayered. People are no longer just one thing or another. The old English effort to \"place\" someone by knowing what school they went to no longer works. </p> <p>Equally, politicians need to see that people's interests are more multifaceted than ever before. Their wishes are a contradictory mixture of trade-offs between changing goals as producers, consumers, tax-payers and benefit-receivers.
