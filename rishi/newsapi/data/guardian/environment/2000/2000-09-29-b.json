  "<p>Soooooo, spot anything lovely at London Fashion week? Crocheted thong? Mussel shell skirt? Latex bodysuit? British fashion has certainly been living up to its reputation. Though equally renowned for excellent tailoring and truly innovative design, you can always rely on our lot to transform mere clothes into fantastical costumes, turning fashion shows into theatrical events. </p> <p>You can also rely on the fact that the best of those young Brits will get swept off to head up a fashion house abroad. But back home, Britain has yet to produce a designer who can translate this avant-garde creativity into a global brand. There is no British equivalent of Calvin Klein, Karl Lagerfeld or Giorgio Armani. </p> <p>Twenty-seven years ago, five bright young designers, with similar reputations for wild behaviour, were launched on to the international fashion circuit by the recently formed British Fashion Council, whose main objective was to promote a previously nonexistent London designer scene. Bruce Oldfield, a striking 23-year-old, was one of them. He now plays down his bad boy reputation for clubbing with the pop star set. </p> <p>\"It was a fantastically exciting time,\" he enthuses. \"We were called the New Wave. There are people who would say I was outrageous back then but I think I'm quite conservative. I remember walking into a club in Jermyn Street with Grace Jones in the 70s and whispering: 'Er, you know, um, when we go in, I think a little less cracking of the whip would be, um, a good thing' and she was like: 'Oh, get a life'.\" </p> <p>Today Bruce Oldfield is a happy man. Still sparky and handsome, he runs a small but exclusive couture house from an elegant showroom in Beauchamp Place, supplying sumptuous eveningwear to the upper echelons of British and American society. Ladies who lunch love him. </p> <p>\"I run a very small business,\" he says simply. \"I wouldn't want it to be any bigger. I'm not sure I'd be any good at joining the big bad world.\" </p> <p>Oldfield doesn't blame British fashion for our lack of global commercial success. \"The British public is not interested in clothes,\" he points out. \"The nearest we get to an international conglomerate is M&amp;S.\" </p> <p>Having made the transition from cool to esteemed, Oldfield is well-placed to pinpoint the problems. \"After the war,\" he says, \"Britain was de-skilled by the need for cheap clothing. The workers were replaced with machines. There are now very few factories in the UK that can produce any kind of desirable garments in any kind of quantity. It's frightening.\" </p> <p>The British government has recognised this problem and last week announced a \u00a31.5m handout. Oldfield doesn't believe this will solve the problem. \"What went hand in hand with the need for cheaper clothing was the inherent notion that clothing was a little bit silly, a little bit frivolous. They are quite puritanical, the British. It's considered poor taste to show your wealth. Even now I have customers who wouldn't want their staff to know how much they have spent on a dress. The British don't like show-offs and they don't like clothes that are showy-offy.\" </p> <p>The only section of the British public truly interested in fashion, Oldfield maintains, doesn't have the income to support designers. \"They are all under 25 and spend what they have in Top Shop. Serious earners have many different calls on their income. Private education, for example.\" </p> <p>He is quick to point out how ironic it is that a country that spends relatively little on designer goods is renowned for producing the most creative students in the world. \"Most of them, certainly the ones who get noticed, are wacky. They are encouraged to treat fashion like caricature. They're told: 'You're so outrageous and cutting edge. Go on, go on, do it. Make something else that won't sell.' If they are given the platform to do that, of course they will, then they'll sink without trace. Someone will put money behind them, they'll have a few seasons, but they have to get real in a very short space of time. Most don't.\" </p> <p>Oldfield believes we are churning out too many designers. From the original five, London Fashion Week now has 49 shows and over 150 exhibitors. \"I'm a governor of the London Institute, which covers St Martins and the London College of Fashion, but I'm not always sure our fashion schools give out the right messages.\" </p> <p>Oldfield's own fashion education began after following a career in art. \"I only studied at St Martins for eight months. I found it a little over-intellectual. I didn't want to hear: 'The bike has two wheels, so design a collection around the bike.' I have imagination and creativity. But the practical side was great: we were trained to cut clothes, make clothes, design clothes; we were taught how to enhance the form. That's what good design is all about - it's not about engaging somebody's mind in some kind of philosophical debate.\" </p> <p>So how does he feel when a designer says he is inspired by homeless people? \"I laugh. No, actually I don't laugh. I think, what system is producing that kind of a response?\" </p> <p>But it's often these same designers that get taken up by a foreign company with lots of money and plenty of products to sell. Oldfield seems almost wistful on the subject. \"I got sent the Dior catalogue the other day. It's very, very beautiful, a glamorous book, but there's not a garment in it. They are only selling bags. What Galliano produces is fabulous, it's wonderful, it makes good press. But Galliano doesn't have to worry about whether or not his clothes are selling. Our young designers can't hope to compete.\" </p> <p>The news isn't all bad, though. The UK clothing and textile industry is the seventh largest in the country and at first glance, the designer sector also looks relatively healthy. Since 1990 it has grown threefold and is currently worth \u00a3600m - but compare that with Calvin Klein's turnover of \u00a32.76b. </p> <p>\"Rifat Ozbek was the first designer based here to understand the system and milk it,\" Oldfield says. \"He chose Britain as a creative launchpad, then when he moved to Paris, there was a big brouhaha about him abandoning London. I thought, why not? Paris gets more buyers and press.\" </p> <p>Presumably this idea would not go down well with the British Fashion Council. But Oldfield is known for being outspoken - not in a dramatic, fashiony way, he simply knows his business. Twenty-five years on, one of the original bad boys may no longer make it into the gossip columns, but he makes very nice dresses at very nice prices. Did he have to tone down his creativity in order to appeal to his more conservative clientele? </p> <p>\"I know my customers - I know where they go on holiday, where they live, what car they drive. A great preponderance of them are aged between 35 and 55, but these women don't want to be told they are getting on and that they should be wearing something a bit more sensible.\" </p> <p>Is he envious of his international contemporaries whose names adorn the waistbands of underpants across the world? \"Would I be any happier if I had shops all around the world, perfumes and bedlinen? I could - it's a good name, people know it - but I don't want that kind of pressure and I don't need to earn more money. I'd be bored on a big, big yacht. I don't want a Rolls-Royce, thank you very much. Is Calvin Klein any happier with what he's got than I am with what I've got? Probably not.\" </p> <p>It's Tuesday September 26 2000. 7.30pm. Queues are forming outside a warehouse in Victoria in readiness for the launch of Alexander McQueen's spring/summer collection. At the Lord Mayor's residence in Mansion House, Bruce Oldfield is celebrating his 50th birthday with a fashion show and charity auction, sponsored by Krug champagne in aid of Barnado's. Oldfield's runway is without sensationalist fashion ploys; his guests lack cool factor. But the models and assembled ladies display some of the most sumptous and elegant couture gowns in the world. Oldfield has won his international acclaim. Even if not a lot of people know it.</p>",
  "Pierre Trudeau, the flamboyant politician who led Canada for more than 15 years in which he shocked, thrilled and inspired his nation, died yesterday, aged 80, from Parkinson's disease and prostate cancer. <p>Canada was yesterday preparing for a state funeral and a lengthy period of mourning for Trudeau, who was recently voted the most important Canadian of the 20th century. </p> <p>Trudeau was the country's prime minister from 1968 to 1979 and, after a nine-month interlude, from 1980 to 1984. His relaxed style, his habit of speaking his mind and his marriage to a woman 29 years his junior all contributed to \"Trudeaumania\" at home, and global celebrity. </p> <p>His death was announced by Roy Heenan, a partner in his Montreal law firm. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation interrupted regular viewing to broadcast a special programme about Trudeau's life.</p> <p>Trudeau was a French Canadian who changed his country from a monocultural English-dominated state to a bilingual and more tolerant place. In so doing, he defused a growing Quebec separatist movement.</p> <p>He became unpopular in western Canada for his insistence on holding down prices that the region could charge the rest of the country for oil and national gas. At one point, when confronted by a crowd of hecklers who barracked him on the subject, he famously raised his middle finger at them in an insouciant salute.</p> <p>Outside Canada he will probably be best remembered for his easy going celebrity, his acerbic sense of humour and his wedding at 51 to the 22-year-old Margaret Sinclair. The marriage soon turned sour, as she cuckolded Trudeau, once disappearing after a Rolling Stones concert to become a temporary groupie. </p> <p>Even in his twilight years, he was irrepressible. At 71 he was named on a birth certificate as father of a girl born to Deborah Coyne, 36, a Liberal party constitutional expert.</p> <p>Trudeau's friends said he never fully recovered from the death of his third son, Michel, who was swept into a lake by an avalanche in 1998 while on a ski trip in British Columbia. Trudeau brought instant sex appeal to a staid political culture, driving around Ottawa in a convertible car, and dating a string of beautiful women. </p> <p>He also led the drive to distance Canada from British apron strings, enshrining a Charter of Rights in a new constitution in 1982. In a supreme act of irreverence, he once turned a balletic pirouette behind the Queen's back.</p>",
  "<p><strong>starling5</strong> <br> Are you prepared to accept an ethical dimension to your Gaia theory whereby all lives have equal value? Or are we, as humans, entitled to favour ourselves as we must in everyday life?</p> <p><strong>James Lovelock:</strong><br> So far as Gaia is concerned, humans are not special. We're just another species. There is a strong ethic attached to Gaia, and that is that the species that lives well with its environment favours it for its progeny and the species that fouls the environment spoils it for its progeny and goes extinct.</p> <p><strong>nsalt </strong><br> Your thoughts on nuclear power are refreshing. For so long it has been singled out as the evil amongst energy sources while conventional power stations the world over continue to belch their polluting gases. But there is a risk factor with nuclear power even if it's smaller than that of coal etc. Renewable fuels, particularly biomass, used locally on a small scale seem better still. Should we be putting more effort into this research?</p> <p><strong>James Lovelock:</strong><br> Large-scale nuclear power is the only practical way that we have to solve the greenhouse gas problem. Of course we should do everything else as well including renewable fuels, windmills, but we should recognise that these are no substitute.</p> <p><strong>greenday234</strong><br> You probably get asked this a lot, but how did you come to know William Golding, who gave Gaia her/its name? What was he like and what did he think of the theory?</p> <p> <strong>James Lovelock:</strong><br> I knew Bill Golding as a neighbour when I lived in Wiltshire. He was a good friend and we would often talk as we walked to the village post office about half a mile away. When it was something exciting, like Gaia, we would walk well beyond the post office. He liked the theory, perhaps because he had been trained in physics as a student as well as in the arts. He said that if you would put forward a big theory about the earth, you'd better give it a good name and he would call it Gaia. We walked on for 20 minutes talking at cross-purposes because I thought he meant 'gyre' (I have no classics). Then Bill said no, I meant Gaia - the Greek goddess.</p> <p><strong> jjjeremy</strong><br> You say that nuclear power plants may be useful in supply electricity without worsening global warming. But doesn't it take generating extra greenhouse gases to be able to build and then dispose of one nuclear power plant. A nuclear power station also has to be very big to work with a centralised power grid and we would need to build a lot of them across Europe. Wouldn't we just end up with big, inefficient plants and lots more greenhouse gases? <br> Wouldn't it be better to decentralise the grid, build efficiency into useage and the grid, use renewables and take away the subsidies from nuclear power generation and give this to alternatives?</p> <p><strong>James Lovelock:</strong><br> It's true that building a nuclear power plant will require a lot of concrete and release a lot of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. However, a plant runs for 50 years or more, and in that time release vastly less greenhouse gas than fossil fuel-burning power stations. <br> I believe that in Sweden small-scale nuclear power stations have now been designed for public use.</p> <p><strong>kudra</strong> <br> What are your thoughts on the recent fuel 'crisis' and the way that it was/is being handled?</p> <p><strong>James Lovelock:</strong><br> The public response to the recent fuel crisis appalled me. They seemed to have no idea whatsoever of the dangers that lie ahead and thought only of their immediate personal needs. I should not have been surprised because in China, with its truly powerful government, they have admitted that they cannot hold back the personal aspirations of the people where burning fossil fuels is concerned. <br> In a survey during the Suez fuel crisis, people interviewed claimed to be prepared to pay so much for fuel that their families would be in danger of privation. They valued personal mobility above all else. This is a human characteristic. <br> I think the Chancellor is right - you've got to be tough on this one.</p> <p><strong> nisaac </strong><br> I think that Gaia is a great metaphor for processes in the biosphere. However, I've been disappointed to find that other ecologists instinctively recoil at the idea of the Planet Personified. Whilst they are right to argue in favour of rigorous hypothesis testing, we all need some kind of bigger picture. What do you make of this? Where is the halfway house?</p> <p><strong>James Lovelock:</strong><br> I think the biologists fight dirty. You have to use metaphor to explain science to people. The biologists have the wonderful metaphor of the selfish gene. No one challenges them, saying 'how absurd - how could a gene take thought and be selfish?' <br> So why do they dislike my metaphor of a living earth? <br> It's very expensive to experiment with the earth - as we shall soon find out, for that's exactly what we've been doing with C02s.</p> <p><strong>rgsharp</strong><br> How would you sum up the concept of 'Gaia'?</p> <p><strong>James Lovelock:</strong><br> Gaia is a theory about the earth. It sees it as a self-regulating system. It keeps its climate and its chemistry always comfortable for whatever is the contemporary biosphere. Its major difference from older evolutionary theories such as Darwinism is that it sees organisms not just adapting to the environment, but changing it as well.</p> <p><strong> rabbit21 </strong><br> How far do you consider the name 'Gaia' to be responsible for the popular attraction to your theory? Equally, how far do you consider the name to be responsible for popular misunderstanding of the theory?</p> <p><strong>James Lovelock:</strong><br> Folk need a good metaphor and 'Gaia' has helped establish herself by her nice short name. <br> Naturally, many academic scientists do not like this way of presenting science.</p> <p><strong> buttercup23 </strong> <br> If you were prime minister for a day, what would be the one law you would pass to try to restore our relationship with Gaia?</p> <p><strong>James Lovelock:</strong><br> A few years ago, I published an article in Science,the American equivalent of Nature. In it, I considered what might happen in the 21st century. Perhaps we would go on slowly getting a little more crowded and a little more polluted, but still civilisation would be much as before. Alternatively, we could suffer any one of several catastrophes, such as a volcanic eruption no more severe than Tamboura in 1815 or Laki in Iceland in 1783. These two volcanoes put so much dust into the air that the sun's rays were enfeebled, the earth grew cool and there were two years without harvest. <br> There were then far fewer people in the world, so there were famines, but not enough to destroy civilisation. Just imagine what would happen now. It is said that we have no more than 15-50 days' grain stocks in store at any one time. Two years makes this seem a very short time. <br> So what can we do about it? <br> One thing we can do is to make sure that our successors in the next Dark Age know what we did wrong and have encapsulated in a simple book all the hard-won key facts of science, philosophy, art, etc that would enable them to start the new civilisation. <br> I would like to see the book as a primer for primary-school use to make children familiar with what our civilisation really was. It would be as well-written as the Tyndale bible and kept in every home - thus available, should disaster strike, for our successors.</p> <p><strong>blackbird21</strong><br> The greenhouse effect and the potential damage to the ozone layer has only entered the public consciousness in the last 10 years. With the onset of unleaded petrol and 'environmentally friendly' products, is it really a case of too little too late?</p> <p><strong>James Lovelock:</strong><br> Too little too late? It may be too late to save civilisation, but people will survive and there will be another one. There were 30 before the present, so why should this one be so special?</p> <p><strong> blackbird21 </strong><br> And what are your views on GM Crops, how do they fit into the gaia theory?</p> <p><strong>James Lovelock:</strong><br> My feeling about GM crops is that we are straining at a gnat while swallowing the camel of greenhouse-gas accumulation.</p> <p>That's all I have time for - thanks very much and goodbye.</p>",
  "<p>When it comes to literary cuisine I've always been a believer in what Italians call 'il slow-food'. So how did I get into this position? It began, appropriately enough, in Greece. In 1991 the Greek government invited me there to help celebrate 2,500 years of Hellenic Democracy (with a few gaps). Owing to the importance of poetry in Greek, the centrepiece of the celebrations was a sumptuously hosted World Conference of Poets.</p> <p>Of this conference I chiefly remember a glorious feast of multilingual conversations. At one table on the first night a would-be Byronic poet from Scandinavia was dropping lines like \"For me the beauty of the world is concentrated in all women.\" I caught a wink from a tall Greek who seemed to be in the entourage of the Minister for Culture. \"Are you a poet too?\", I asked him. \"No, I labour in the Minister.\" \"Oh, you work in the Ministry for Culture?\" \"As I said. I labour in the Minister. I am his surgeon.\"</p> <p>In the course of the conference I made several Greek friends, and I learned from them that they were hoping to see the office of Olympic poet revived when Greece next got the Olympic Games. In fact this will not happen until 2004, as Sydney got them first.</p> <p>It then occurred to me that there was no need to wait till 2004. I had just written a book of verse on the Snowy Mountains region of Australia, more or less on commission from National Parks. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office had recently imported me to Britain to open its Breath of Fresh Air environmental conference on Britain's (still surprisingly numerous) overseas territories. That too had involved having the right poems to hand on the right themes. </p> <p>So, having proved that, on a sufficiently interesting topic, I could write more or less to order, I felt bold enough to put forward my name. I talked to my friend Les Murray, another obvious candidate, who encouraged me to proceed. He remarked that he was disqualifying himself on a technicality: \"I can't stand sport.\"</p> <p>What I still needed to find was a conspicuously literate politician to take up the idea. The obvious candidate was the Premier of New South Wales, Bob Carr. He heads the State government responsible for staging the Olympics, and is also one of the most well-read politicians in the English-speaking world. Then, like a sign from the gods that this project was meant to be, I opened the Sydney Morning Herald one morning to find an article by Bob Carr titled \"My best books of the year\" - in which he praised one of my own books to the skies. </p> <p>I phoned up his minders and asked to speak to the Premier. \"Not possible,\" they said bluntly. \"Well, can I speak to Bob Carr the literary critic?\" They relented so far as to take my number. \"But don't expect anything.\" Ten minutes later the Premier phoned me back. He listened to the idea and encouraged me to proceed. </p> <p>Eventually, with his blessing the Australia Council gave me their largest fellowship - $40,000 to spend a year writing a book of verse on all aspects of the Sydney 2000 Games. The Australian media were immediately fascinated. Somehow the idea of an Olympic poet or of a poet laureate (another idea which is now being mooted for Australia) turns literature into news.</p> <p>But this brought dangers. The next day I was under the shower when the phone rang. It was the Australian Broadcasting Commission's main radio program on politics. Could I give them a poem about the topical issue of people being mailed Olympic tickets for the wrong events? And could they record it in 15 minutes? I said I'd think about it while finishing the shower...</p> <p> 'Hush! Can you hear? <br> - All over the suburbs, the roar<br> of envelopes tearing? And Yes!, at Number 10<br> It's Gold! Gold! Gold! for the Protheros! <br> They've lit a fire. They're dancing on the lawn. <br> - Not so good at Number 15. <br> The Grampolis are bit bronzed off. <br> They thrill to the shrill of the soccer ref's whistle. <br> Hard luck! It's the Lady's Nude Luge for them!<br> </p> <p>Still, writing poems under that sort of pressure was a recipe for mediocrity, and I let it be known that there would be no more \"instant\" poems.</p> <p>How do you do a year's writing on an event that is over in less than a month? One answer is to start early. The Sydney Games were preceded by the world's longest torch relay. Since these were billed as the Green Games, it made sense to follow the Olympic flame on its 100-day route round the continent. That way I could write about all the environments, human and non-human, the flame went through.</p> <p>I envisaged a leisurely experience of Australia following flame-bearing joggers who moved at 8kms an hour. The reality was different. For one thing, the flame was run only about 50 kms a day (100 runners, doing a half kilometre each). That was what the media showed. What you didn't see was the Olympic flame sitting in first-class with a gas mantle on its head and flying like the clappers. </p> <p>I had to drive 5,000 kilometres for my first two sightings of the flame, one in central Australia at Uluru (Ayers Rock) near Alice Springs, and the next on the Queensland coast near Brisbane. In Uluru I wrote a comic symbolic poem about the Olympic caravan meeting the timeless Dreamtime world:</p> <p> <strong>Zeus 2000 meets the Elder</strong> (for Connie) </p> <p> Magically, languidly, taxiing South from Olympus, <br> descending at last by local willy-willy<br> the big blond fellow was down with a cat-like bound, <br> strode through the campfires, and stuck out his hand: <br> 'You're the Uluru elders? I'm Zeus; <br> God of Gods, CEO of Skyfather Estates, <br> and Patron of three sacred games<br> through my subsidiary Hera-Juno. <br> Hello? You're a silent lot. <br> Not seen a god without pants before? Well, look away. <br> Mind you, it feels cool. Got your seasons scrambled? <br> Makes a god feel shrunk - not that nymphs complain! <br> Say, you do great burnt offerings here! Smells yummy, <br> like you burn the whole country, herds and all. <br> Suits me. I'm a steak-loving god. 'Well, no beating about the burning bush - I deal<br> in godships. Local deities are history. <br> The word now is amalgamate. Like my card says: <br> Second only to Brahma, but we try harder. <br> So - you got any locals might like to roll under my wing? <br> Thousands have. And it works. Even I, back yonks, <br> was just a local ford demon... </p> <p>Sport, of course, is an issue on which Australians are deeply divided. Australia has more than its share of sports fanatics, yet more people left Sydney for the Olympic period than arrived. Perhaps not all would have endorsed Barry Humphries' definition of sport as \"a loathsome and dangerous occupation\"; yet my observation is that a good 30% of Australians want nothing to do with the Olympic Games. Indeed even Premier Bob Carr, the man ultimately in charge of the Games, has made no attempt to pretend that he is a sports fan. As the Classical Companion sourly remarks, it is something of a mystery how Pindar managed to make great poetry \"from the monotonous and unpromising material of athletic victories\".</p> <p>Most sports are zero-sum games: what the winners gain is stripped from the losers, so that the results for which they strive spread exaltation and depression equally among the fans, with no overall gain. Sport, like poetry, makes nothing happen - even if it turns over enough money to make executives wish to tamper. Yet the very fact that we are not quite serious about sport gives a poet one important freedom: to experiment with a range of verse forms.</p> <p>Since the late 19th century, when Whitman and Hardy noticed (on opposite sides of the Atlantic) that English was no longer an iambic language, it has been difficult to write in regular rhythm; and therefore it has also been difficult to write in rhyme. </p> <p>This of course applies only to serious topics. For comedy one can still poodle-clip the language back into the old metres (the most extreme form being the limerick). Much of the public has never forgiven poets for abandoning rhyme and rhythm; and poets who do want to use rhyme often choose therefore to write, even on serious topics, in a semi-comic mode. Sport, because we know it is really only play, lends itself to such treatment.</p> <p>By contrast, the victory of the Aboriginal runner Cathy Freeman in the 400 metres was serious national business, and demanded free verse. Her chief rival Marie-Jos&amp;#eacute Perec of France had cracked under the pressures of expectation. She fled the Olympic Games after suffering what seemed like a breakdown. For Freeman, who carried the hopes of Aboriginal Australia, the pressures were even more intense. </p> <p>Half an hour after her victory, which came late in the evening, I phoned the Australian Broadcasting Commission to say I thought I had an 'Ode to Cathy Freeman' coming on. With some trepidation, I was booked to read it on national radio just after the 8am news next morning. After all, I told myself, skilled journalists are expected to produce their finest at an hour or two's notice, so why should a poet need the Horatian nine years to get a poem right?</p> <p>Back home I repented of that rashness. There were two or three different poems fighting their way through my head, and it was not till 2am that I had something to read next morning. It began:</p> <p>'Running into that ocean roar of welcome<br> with the face of a hurt child striving,</p> <p>among tense rival queens<br> whose castles are built of milliseconds, <br> you came from behind.</p> <p>Go Phantom! <br> Our own corroboree-striped Phantom, <br> ghost who runs in pain<br> - to a lap of honor with a double flag. <br> Then the pain of great tears about to start . . .'</p> <p>I had chanced on the same approach as Pindar. Unlike the sports commentators, who tell you the mechanics of how an athlete wins, I had concentrated on what winning and losing mean.</p> <p>The Olympics has been a rushed and sleepless time for me. I have had more media attention in a fortnight than a poet would normally expect in a lifetime - and there were times when I felt I was under more pressure than Perec or Freeman. It has been hard to finish poems under such media scrutiny, and while retaining a properly professional relationship to the various Olympic bodies - neither antagonised nor duchessed by them. Yet I believe I have drafted enough good ideas to keep me busy for six months revising them, and to make in the end a small book of worthwhile poems. By then the Olympics will no longer be topical, and the poems must stand on their merits.</p> <p>I hope that in 2004 the Greeks will appoint an Olympic poet of their own, and that future host countries will follow suit. It will at worst produce mere occasional verse - and the odd bard who cracks under the media pressure. At best, the still small voice of the individual poet may counter the bland triumphalism of the Olympic media - and may find a human meaning in this most bizarre of human activities: the solemn playing of pointless yet (for some of us) deeply satisfying games.</p>",
  "<p>The Jag pulled into the coiffured grounds of France's very own Silicon Valley business development, Eden-Olympia. </p> <p>\"Welcome, Dr Sinclair,\" said Penrose Wilder, the resident psychiatrist, to Jane, my wife. </p> <p>We'd met a few months earlier in hospital after my air crash and were married soon after. She was young, restless; I was middle-aged, semi-crocked and when she had suggested taking up the post in Cannes I had readily agreed, even though we would be living in the shadow of her former colleague - perhaps lover - Dr Greenwood, who had gone berserk while working at Eden and killed seven residents, taken three more hostage, before turning the gun on them and himself. </p> <p>The days passed in anomie. The super-rich kept to themselves, Jane worked 12-hour days, and I walked the trails that led nowhere. It was Halder, the black security guard, that put me on the right track. Greenwood hadn't killed the hostages; they had been his accomplices. </p> <p>Jane and I drifted apart. She injected herself with diamorphine and passed her evenings in the arms of Simone Delarge. I started an affair with Greenwood's former lover, Frances Baring. </p> <p>\"Take me into the bathroom and bugger me,\" she cooed. \"Or how about a golden shower or underage girls? Everyone else is at it here.\" It was true. I had examined Greenwood's crime scene photos and they had told a story of drugs, violence and paedophilia. He wasn't mad. His victims had been chosen. </p> <p>\"You're right,\" Wilder acknowledged. \"But it's the psychopathy that keeps everyone sane. Before we organised the drugs and vice rings and the ratissage on the local immigrants, our top executives were getting ill. But now they are encouraged to indulge their dark side, they are fulfilled. We hardly get any medical problems and corporate profits have soared. Greenwood wanted to expose us on TV, so we had to kill him.\" It had a perverse logic and I couldn't help warming to Wilder, so I decided to keep quiet.

The 50/50 joint venture launches within six months and will be available on all platforms, screening over 1,000 films from several studios. </p> <p> The Studio will broadcast for 18 hours a day, seven days a week, with NTL subscribers the first to access the service. The channel will be available at basic tier entry-level at no extra cost.</p> <p> The channel will be managed by Universal Studios Networks UK, which runs the Sci Fi channel on Sky Digital. The films already booked for the channel include Babe, Carlito's Way and True Lies.</p> <p> Janet Goldsmith, managing director of Universal Studios Networks UK, said: \"NTL has a strong track record in developing innovative packages and a forward-thinking approach to this market. We are delighted to be working in partnership with them.\"</p> <p> NTL is consolidating its position as the UK's leading cable company by buying up content, having signed a five-year carriage deal with BSkyB this month. The arrangement is expected to produce pay-per-view football channels, as both companies have stakes in Premiership clubs.</p> <p> Steve Wagner, managing director of marketing at NTL, said: \"The channel dovetails well with our recent BSkyB deal and leverages the popularity of movies to encourage many more consumers to watch highly desirable content.\" </p>",
  "<p>Vivendi is next in line to take a stake in NewsCorp, following yesterday's news that US cable company Liberty Media will take a stake in Sky Global.</p> <p> The complex deal sees Rupert Murdoch's media conglomerate take Liberty's 21% holding in interactive programme guide-maker Gemstar-TV Guide, raising its stake to 43%. In return, Liberty will increase its holding in NewsCorp from 7% to 18% and acquire 4.7% of Sky Global.</p> <p>Mr Murdoch, chairman of NewsCorp, said: \"We have enjoyed a long, productive and mutually beneficial relationship with Liberty Media and Dr John Malone, one of the giants of the media industry. </p> <p> \"That John has chosen to become our single largest non-voting equity owner is as strong an endorsement as we could get of our strategic direction and operational performance.\"</p> <p> Mr Murdoch's relationship with Jean-Marie Messier, the Vivendi chairman, will now come under scrutiny, as Mr Messier is known to be keen to take a stake in Sky Global. Vivendi owns 25% of NewsCorp's UK satellite broadcaster, BSkyB, but wants to convert its interest into a holding in Sky Global. </p> <p> Sky Global's planned flotation is one of the most eagerly anticipated IPOs in years, with Mr Murdoch putting a value of up to $40bn (\u00a328bn) on the company. Mr Messier has ambitious plans for Vivendi, as demonstrated by the company's planned \u00a323bn merger with Seagram, owner of film giant Universal Studios. The merger is awaiting clearance from European Commission regulators, but both parties are confident it will go through.</p> <p> If Mr Murdoch does not further dilute his holding in NewsCorp to benefit Messier, then Vivendi may decide to take the company head on.</p>",

  "<p>The chances of early British membership of the euro have diminished markedly as a result of yesterday's no vote in the Danish referendum. And rightly so. For all the talk about the single currency being part of an inevitable historical process it is quite obvious that many people across Europe see the euro as a bad idea. When given the opportunity to vote on it, they don't like it.</p> <p>There are three good reasons why the Blair government should give the single currency a wide berth. First, there is the economic argument. The euro's value has plummeted by more than 25% since its launch in January 1999 dashing hopes that it would be a rock-solid currency. </p> <p>Moreover, the one-size-fits-all interest rate for the 11 member countries has meant that the cost of borrowing is too low in some countries - witness Ireland's inflation rate of more than 6% - and too high in others, particularly Germany. Had Britain joined the euro at its inception, the result would have been high inflation in the short term and a very serious recession in the long term.</p> <p>Second, there is the democratic argument. One of the main factors in the Danish referendum was the sense among voters that they wanted more control over their lives, rather than ceding decision-making to remote, unaccountable and centralised bodies. </p> <p>In Britain, the government's recent difficulties have been as much about the backlash against what people see as top-down decision-making by an out-of-touch elite as it has been about the nuances of policy. On road fuel tax, on the Dome, and on pensions, the government did not listen. It must make sure it does over the euro, because as the Danes have illustrated, it is no longer possible for the great and the good - either at national, European or global level - to dictate policy over the heads of the people.</p> <p>Finally, there is the political argument. In Denmark, the entire political, media and business establishment was for the euro, yet the yes camp still lost convincingly. In Britain, where the balance of forces for and against the single currency is much more even and opinion polls show a deep scepticism about monetary union, the government has to acknowledge that it could lose a referendum by a thumping majority. </p> <p>If that happened, Mr Blair's administration would be broken: it would lose its moral authority and find it much harder to push through its domestic agenda of improving public services, tackling poverty and raising living standards. </p> <p>In the end, the government will probably conclude that the potential costs of a lost referendum far outweigh the nebulous benefits of winning one against the odds. And it will be right.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Big Brother special ingredients Part I</strong> <br> Monkey noted at Victoria Real's post-Big Brother party that when it comes to debauchery, digital types are outdoing their meeja counterparts. The dancefloor antics of Brighton's answer to Bez, Jason George, were exceeded only by the increasingly numerous and enthusiastic trips to the luxury mobile toilets by court jester in residence Paul Munford.   <strong>Big Brother special ingredients Part II</strong> <br> Now that everyone is attempting closure on Big Brother, it's time to set the record straight. One rumour that was confirmed by web stalwarts at the Big Brother house party on Thursday was the one doing the rounds at the start of the show's run about Randy Andy's secret rising ingredient for bread. Seems Andy's little trip to the lavvie during a bread kneading session resulted in more than just yeast been added to the dough. The impudent Jack the lad didn't even bother to wash his hands and innocently sat back, relishing in watching his housemates devour the fruits of his monkey spanking. This innocent Monkey is, quite rightly, speechless.  <strong>Not quite all over for Wembley commentator</strong> <br> The man who coined the immortal phrase \"They think it\u00b9s all over...\" really did think Wembley was going to be all over without him. Kenneth Wolstenholme, commentator at the historic 1966 England World Cup victory at Wembley over Germany, hadn't been invited to the England-Germany match next Saturday, the final game before the stadium is demolished. Now Sport First has hired the game's most memorable voice to write about the last match. What a joy, says Kenneth. Well, it is now!   <strong>What's in a suffix?</strong><br> Associated New Media finally came clean with its plans and new name for lead balloon CharlotteStreet.com this week, scotching rumours that it was going to launch you.co.uk. Instead we're to get femail.co.uk and rumour has it this new strategy of using the mail suffix will be applied to a number of Associated New Media websites. Staunch Royalist The Mail is said to be keen to develop a site devoted to that bastion of British culture, the Royal family (no, not the TV programme) but unfortunately for The Mail, a certain carrier of letters has already had the foresight to register royalmail.co.uk. Keen checkers of domain name registrations however, will be aware that Associated has already registered travelmail.co.uk, shopmail.co.uk, moneymail.co.uk and financialmail.co.uk. In fact the only one that is still available is showbizmail.co.uk - better snap it up quick. BR&gt;  <strong>Yawning risers</strong><br> As the battle of the breakfast bulletins shapes up, it's nice to know GMTV isn't straying too far from its roots. Monkey understands that a well-known ballerina, whose agents approached the network offering an exclusive interview, was turned down on the grounds that \"ballet dancers are too upmarket for us. They turn off our viewers\".  <strong>It came from the stalker</strong><br> Sophie Raworth, the pretty half of the BBC's new breakfast team, has caused quite a stir among blue-chip types. Eyebrows were raised at BBC news after she was found to have a website set up by a celebrity stalker. And it gets worse. Sophie's name mysteriously yields a link to a US adult site called Celeb Secrets: \"the web storehouse for nude celebrities\".   <strong>Hats off to Shatfield</strong><br> Anyone remember Stefano Hatfield, the former editor-in-chief of Campaign who defected to the monthly US trade mag Ad Age International? Tall bloke, lots of hair? Well he's been working his little Gucci socks off over in New York to relaunch and rebrand the title as Ad Age Global - and what an enormous difference it has made. Recent exclusives include \"Procter &amp; Gamble to launch electric mop across Europe.\" Several rivals are already rumoured to be giving up the ghost in the face of such stiff competition. Introducing the new-look magazine, Hatfield asks readers to \"let us know what you think\" about the revamp by e-mail. His e-mail address is rather less glamorous than his new title, or the magazine. Unfortunately it's shatfield@crain.com. Apparently the magisterial Shatfield has issued edicts to his minions that he \"doesn't want any jokes\". So no comments about the shat hitting the fan or no shatting on your own doorstep.</p> <p> <strong>Media medals</strong> <br> And they're off... Media Monkey has been inspired by plucky Team GB's growing Lottery money-fuelled medal haul Down Under to launch its own Olympic medal table, based on which UK media outfit has the most executives in Sydney on sports-related jollies. The inaugural table has United News &amp; Media placed third (Malcolm Wall - a marginal decision though, as by next week he'll be a Granada employee), with the BBC (Greg Dyke and Peter Salmon) and Channel 5 (Dawn Airey and David Elstein) level-pegging in second place, with two medals each. But storming ahead in first place is... Granada Media, with three medals (Charles Allen, Steve Morrison and Jules Burns). So Granada's purchase of that stake in Channel 7 (the Australian Olympic broadcaster) has paid off after all. If you know any more, let us know and we'll update the medal table accordingly.  <strong>If you're not on the list...</strong> <br> Mystery surrounds the pulling of BBC1's Nicholas Lyndhurst drama Thin Ice, which was plugged as one of the highlights of channel's autumn line-up and was due to go out next Saturday night, out of the schedule at short notice. Surely the Beeb's scheduling gurus could not have been quaking in their boots at the thought of the boy Lyndhurst going up against ropey old ITV blooper-fest It Shouldn't Happen to a Quiz Show Host, could it? Whatever the reason for the programming volte face, it is likely to provoke much gnashing of teeth in TV listings and weekend supplement offices across medialand that have lined up Lyndhurst features that are now too late to change.  <strong>Late show</strong> <br> Panorama gets the stories first, part 63. Mariella Frostrup's big investigation into Big Brother and reality TV shows is going out in November, six weeks after the Channel 4 series finished. Still, it'll be good for those who have spent the summer and autumn out of the country.   <strong>A new spin on the fuel crisis</strong> <br> Noel Edmonds's Video Meeting Company needs a trip to the classroom, if its latest press release is anything to go by. An announcement on the petrol crisis started with a sentence that was clearly written by a hyperactive three year-old with a bag of fridge magnets. \"As British business battles to devise ways and means of avoiding disaster next time there is a threat the petrol pumps will run dry, players in the video communications industry have never had it so good.\" Monkey is sure there's good news trapped in that sentence somewhere, but we work it out cannot.  <strong>The Sada truth</strong> <br> Sada, aka the hippy chick from Big Brother who now drives around in a spanking new ferrari, was spotted ducking into Freud Communications on Tuesday. It seems she's doing yet another promotion and hasn't even started the PR for her imminent book. Surely this is not the same tofu-loving, joga-obsessed trustafarian we met 12 weeks ago? The words \"sell\" and \"out\" keep springing to mind.   <strong>Shock as hairy man fronts BBC's Breakfast show</strong> <br> Observers of the BBC's growing obsession with image may remember there were fisticuffs when the last champion of the hirsute, Michael Burke, tried to grow a beard. With a hairy man at the corporation's helm, you would think the BBC's policy of banning facial hair for news presenters may have eased up. Not so. The stakes have been upped, however, by the arrival of Jeremy \"Rambo\" Bowen, fresh from the frontline with a moustache. Sources at BBC News confirm that Bowen, who has been brought in to apply the Johnny n'Denise factor to the BBC's new morning programme Breakfast, has been exempted from this policy. Burke is not amused.   <strong>Family means family</strong><br> The spin-savvy world we live in means corporate PRs have to go to extraordinary lengths to get past the ho-hum cynicism of journalists. When Dow Jones, publisher of the Wall Street Journal, last week announced that chief financial officer Jerry Bailey was stepping down to spend more time with his family, an internal memo e-mailed to staff from chairman and chief executive Peter Kann read: \"As most of you know, I started my career as a business reporter, and I reported my share of press releases that announce a resignation based on 'personal family reasons'. Some of them, I found, were a bit euphemistic. This one is not.\" You live by the sword...</p> <p> <strong>Sounds sick</strong><br> True story or sick, sick, sick urban myth? According to a top BBC source, Radio 2 has suffered a complaint after, incredibly, following a news item about the conjoined twins with a record... Stuck on You. Monkey is disgusted.</p> <p> <strong>Petrol story crisis</strong><br> Monkey prints verbatim, and without further comment, an email sent at 11am this morning from Tonight with Trevor McDonald editor Jeff Anderson to his production team: \"Did any of you watch Panorama last night? Apparently there was a fuel crisis a couple of weeks ago with garages running dry, food shortages in the shops and hospital operations being cancelled. It all started with a few farmers blocking the Stanlow refinery in Ellesmere Port because they were upset about high taxes on petrol and diesel. Why didn't any of you tell me about this at the time?

  "Inside the cavernous conference centre on Brighton's storm-lashed seafront yesterday Nelson Mandela did exactly what he was supposed to do. Stage-managed the event may have been, but he did it in his own inimitable way. <p>To no one's surprise but everyone's delight he sent the Labour delegates home from their week's exertions bathed in the reflected glory of his own moral grandeur as the world's most admired politician - and possibly its most admired citizen. </p> <p>He beamed, he shook small, proud hands, glad-handed the grown-ups and embraced Tony Blair. His speech contained self-indulgent flourishes about his wife, Graca, being more famous than him and how he, at 82, may even be a \"stupid old man\". </p> <p>But its core message was as hard as a South African diamond: global solidarity for the \"poor and marginalised\" must be sustained in the age of global capitalism. </p> <p>A secular saint he may be, but you do not dominate a liberation movement from jail without being a formidable politician too. At the outset he was careful to say how people of most political persuasions in most countries had condemned the sheer human indignity of apartheid. </p> <p>But at the end he paid back his debt to Labour with a tribute to its enduring values that money could not buy. \"William Hague will have a job to top that,\" quipped a delegate. \"He'll have to invite Pinochet.\"</p>",
  "<p>Prague is over; the IMF/World Bank meeting has shut down early, thanks to pressure from activists who travelled from all over the world to protest against the bank's policies in developing countries. To most people it looked like yet another set-piece confrontation between a ragtag bunch of scruffy protesters and hard-headed cops in riot gear; after Seattle and Washington came S26, the Battle of Prague. </p> <p>Yes, there was violence. \"Black block\" anarchists threw rocks and Molotov cocktails at the police; police charged and beat protesters, fired teargas and water cannon. But even the wildest of commentators estimate the number of violent activists as 1-2% of the 15,000 protesters. Almost all of the many hundreds of NGOs, trade unions and affinity groups attending were peaceful. Yesterday reports were coming out of Prague about police brutality and human-rights abuses against arrested protesters. Members of Ya Basta, a popular group of Italian activists who were extraordinarily well-disciplined and restrained in their direct action, have been labelled \"terrorists\" by the Czech authorities. </p> <p>But much of the protest was a positive affair: there was a samba band, a pink cardboard tank, upbeat trade unionists from Mexico to Manchester; there were well-attended counter-summits, with intellectuals and philosophers theorising on the nuts and bolts of the movement. Many of the demonstrators could give, on demand, a sophisticated critique of the global economy. </p> <p>Focusing on the violence makes it easy to demonise the demonstrators as something dangerous and \"other\". They are dismissed in a variety of contradictory ways: they're rioters, they're rich middle-class kids with nothing better to do, they're crusty undesirables, they're disorganised, they lack vision, they're Luddites. But by condemning them in such crude terms, we condemn ourselves to misunderstand the most significant political movement to emerge in a generation. </p> <p> The Telegraph casts the activists as \"highly educated, bourgeois offspring rejecting the ways and wealth of their parents' generation\". Well, you do have to have the fare to get there. But when it comes to anti-globalisation, the developing world has led the way. The west is playing catch-up. Anti-IMF/World Bank protests have been held all over the global south for more than a decade, from Indonesia to Brazil, from the Philippines to Bolivia. </p> <p>Critics of the movement can't bear the anarchy of it; they see its disparateness as cluelessness rather than a deliberate attempt to overcome traditional hierarchies. But if a movement can force such powerful institutions as the IMF and World Bank to come to a halt early, and if protesters can get inside the conference centre in spite of 11,000 riot police, 5,000 army back-up and a few tanks, their organising skills might be considered rather impressive. </p> <p>In the run-up to Tuesday's demonstration I attended the convergence centre, where \"spokes council\" meetings took place, and found the sense of community and organisation there astonishing and moving. Every \"affinity group\" - NGO or group of friends - sent a spokesperson to meetings to make decisions and work out strategy. It sounds impossible to contain, and it was laborious, but it worked and consensus was found. It felt like proper democracy in a way that the ballot box does not. </p> <p>I was aware, too, of something different about the experience of S26, but it wasn't until the journey home that I realised what it was. No one had tried to sell me anything. The night-time parties weren't sponsored by a beer company. Nothing was branded. </p> <p>The movement's umbrella is a huge one, which can accommodate a vast array of opinions. Is that so terrible a thing? The Zapatistas - heroes to many protesters - say that anti-globalisation demonstrators are made up of \"one no, many yeses\". The no is to rampant capitalism, the yes is to different kinds of societies. It's web-like, it looks like the internet, and it couldn't exist without it. </p> <p>The movement needs to ask itself where it goes from here. It must find a role that is not only, as Naomi Klein, chronicler of anti-corporatism, puts it, turning up at international meetings like Deadheads following the Grateful Dead. But this is a new movement, and it's in no hurry. Whether it burns out or turns into the next big thing will take time to see. </p> <p>Clare Short says that the protesters are \"today's Luddites ... their call to halt historical change and tear down our international institutions offers no solution\" - as if neoliberal globalisation were an inevitability. It isn't. It's a particular form of economics, of human behaviour and development - as Nelson Mandela pointedly told Labour's conference in Brighton yesterday - and resisting it might just be more modern and radical than critics of the anti-globalisation movement dare to think. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:katharine.viner@theguardian.com\">katharine.viner@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "Labour ended its pre-election party conference last night on a high octane mixture of emotion, contrition and hard-nosed political projection on the strategy it will deploy to William Hague's Conservative opposition in the coming campaign. <p>In a call to arms the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, whipped party activists into a frenzy over the Tory record in 18 years of power - and the prospect that \"14 pint Billy Fizz\" might snatch it back again next year. \"Be confident, be proud, walk tall,\" said Mr Prescott as he itemised Labour's achievements and urged them to \"get our message directly to the people\". </p> <p>Concern that voters are still switched off from ministerial claims has been evident all week, though only yesterday did Mr Prescott couple it with a none too veiled warning to senior colleagues that their semi-public feuding in books and newspapers is also damaging Labour's cause. </p> <p>Taking the traditional swipe at the media, Mr Prescott said: \"They have got their agenda and we haved got ours. And it's a different one. So it's the job of everyone in this party - from top to bottom - to get out our agenda and not to feed theirs with the tittle-tattle of years ago.\" </p> <p>The emotional climax in Brighton was provided by Nelson Mandela's speech to the conference, a well crafted mixture of exhortation for global solidarity and thanks to Labour for its loyal support in the long struggle against apartheid. He repaid it with a generous endorsement of its abiding moral values which will have gladdened Mr Blair's election strategists. </p> <p>With an overnight opinion poll suggesting that Mr Hague's opinion poll lead may prove brief - Labour is back on top by two points over the Tories according to Mori - Downing Street showed no inclination to relax its guard after a very bruising month. </p> <p>The usual barn storming climax to the conference was distinguished by Mr Blair's energetic efforts to explain the week's events to voters who may have missed or misunderstood them. In a tour of the radio and TV studios he repeated the main themes of Tuesday's keynote speech while also spelling out what aides had said in the wake of Wednesday's defeat on the issue of pensions strategy. </p> <p>The government will not back down in its refusal to re-link the basic state pension to average earnings because it wants to target most help to the poorest pensioners, he explained. </p> <p>\"We will do what we can when the Budget comes around... what we are trying to do is make sure we can do the things people want us to do in the country, but not at the risk of weakening the economy that's the strongest it's been for decades,\" said Mr Blair. </p> <p>As for the looming threat of more fuel blockades if Gordon Brown does not cut petrol taxes within six weeks, Mr Blair said: \"We have to take steps to make sure this type of blockade can't happen again. </p> <p>\"These protests have been happening all over the world. It is a problem, of course the price of petrol's a problem, but I don't think that people would thank me if we lurched into an emergency budget.\" He promised to campaign to tell voters why it \"is a more complicated situation than sometimes it was presented\". </p> <p>In keeping with his new attempt to sound contrite over recent disasters like the dome he told BBC1: \"You learn a lot from your first term in office. You learn that there are some of these issues that don't affect the fundamentals but are still important to people.\" </p> <p>Mr Blair's claim to be listening to public discontents was directly challenged - as it has been all week - by up to 1,500 protesters from the Countryside Alliance who demonstrated again on the seafront outside the conference hall.</p>",
  "Nelson Mandela received a rapturous reception at the Labour party conference yesterday when he issued a call to the world's affluent people to assume the role of \"keepers\" of the poor. <p>After receiving a seven-minute standing ovation before he had even spoken, the former South African president used his appearance to warn that \"concern for the common good\" was in danger of being lost in the age of the internet. In language which differed sharply from New Labour's attachment to globalisation, Mr Mandela warned of the dangers posed by the \"global village. </p> <p>\"The danger is that globalisation can come to mean only the free flow of goods and finance, the open access to markets, the breaking down of barriers to trade and commerce,\" Mr Mandela said. \"The concern for the common good is in danger of being lost in the current understanding of a global world.\" </p> <p>Alluding to the Bible, Mr Mandela said that the shrinking of the globe had \"made it even more incumbent upon us to become once more the keepers of our brothers and sisters wherever in the world.\" </p> <p>The former president, who went out of his way to reassure big business after the collapse of apartheid, qualified his remarks by saying that globalisation could not be avoided. To laughter, he said: \"Those who are saying they are not going to prepare for this phenomenon, are like saying, 'I don't recognise winter, therefore I'm not going to buy clothing for winter'.\" </p> <p>Labour delegates cried as Mr Mandela, 82, made his first appearance at a British party conference. </p> <p>His appearance followed a moving video of the anti-apartheid struggle which reminded delegates of how every Labour leader had opposed racism in South Africa. </p> <p>Mr Mandela opened his speech by praising the Labour party for opposing apartheid, pointedly making no mention of the Tories, some of whose members were active supporters of the apartheid regime. \"Apartheid was experienced as such a basic onslaught against human dignity that it demeaned all of us,\" he said. </p> <p>To cheers, Mr Mandela said that international support was a key factor which allowed democracy to win through in South Africa. </p> <p>\"Britain was in so many respects the second headquarters of our movement in exile,\" Mr Mandela said. \"Your solidarity helped to make those years of exile bearable and contributed to them not turning out to be wasted years.\" </p> <p>The conference listened in silence as the former South African president gave a moving account of the fight against poverty in South Africa, speaking in bleak terms of how Aids is devastating his country. \"I told prime minister Tony today that apart from poverty we face a crisis of a dimension which I cannot support in words,\" he said. </p> <p>In his final passage, Mr Mandela said that Labour included \"good men and women\" whose devotion to others allowed him to sleep a contented man. </p> <p>\"As I look at you today I can see men and women who are worthy candidates for immortality,\" he said. </p> <p>\"They will be like Aristotle or Plato. We will inter them into the earth but they will live for eternity.\"</p>",
  "<p>News reports from the meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank in Prague this week have been dominated by the violence of a few thousand protesters. Images of cobbles being thrown, policemen being set on fire and ranks of riot police made dramatic copy and television. </p> <p>Now it is all over, and the smell of tear gas is fading in Wenceslas Square, there is real bitterness on all sides. Protesters complain that the \"mainstream\" media allied themselves with the repressive Czech authorities to deliberately misrepresent their presence in Prague. World Bank and IMF officials are tired of their meetings being turned into sieges. Particularly in the bank, reformers, including James Wolfensohn, feel that their efforts to persuade governments to be more generous with aid and debt relief, go unacknowledged. </p> <p>Both sides have to confront tough questions. The protest movement cannot duck the issue of the minority of violent anarchists who now exploit it to vent their own appetite for violence. The anti-globalisation movement is in danger of being discredited because of the antics of a small group. Inpeg, the Czech environmentalist umbrella group which organised the protests, refused to condemn Molotov cocktails being thrown at police: one man burnt was nothing compared to the damage done by the IMF and the World Bank, said one Inpeg spokesman. This is absurd reasoning. The violence is also counterproductive because it discredits the protest movement's claim to be peaceful and constructive. Both these claims are now in question. </p> <p>This is a serious loss; the protest movement has played a role in shifting the thinking of the international institutions - it has raised the profile of debt relief and poverty reduction - while embarking on a mass education campaign. The seminars in the streets in Prague on details of the global financial architecture such as structural adjustment programmes and capital liberalisation, are a healthy contribution to global democracy. </p> <p>Less healthy is the increasingly vocal element calling for abolition of the IMF and the World Bank. This position is the same as that of the right wing of the US Republican party. Abolition will do no favours to developing countries, the only credible path is reform. </p> <p>The fund and the bank are also confronted with pressing questions about their ability to deliver their promises. So far, their progress on debt relief has been agonisingly slow and inadequate. According to Oxfam's latest research on the so-called beneficiaries of the debt relief package, the highly indebted poor countries initiative, Senegal stands to see its debt payments double while Zambia's will increase by a third. Eight countries who have received debt relief are still paying more on their debts than on their health and education budgets. Nearly half of all government revenue in Zambia goes in debt payments, while the country struggles with one of the biggest number of HIV/Aids victims. </p> <p>The purpose of debt relief was not to move the zeros around on the balance sheet but to enable countries to reduce poverty. In the vast majority of indebted countries, that is still a distant dream. </p> <p>This makes the frustration of the protest movement understandable. But the struggle is best served not by charging riot police, but by the hard graft of campaigning and persuading the G7 governments to go back to the drawing board on debt relief (for the third time) and to come up with a scheme which will, finally, be felt in schoolrooms and health clinics in Africa.</p>",
  "<p>Floods, droughts and storms have dramatically increased over the past decades as global temperatures and carbon dioxide levels have risen. </p> <p>A study by the Institute for Environmental Studies at Amsterdam University, released in London yesterday, says that the effects of climate change are already being felt in death and destruction as storms become more violent and frequent. </p> <p>The number of such extreme events has been increasing steadily. There were 14 in the 1950s, and 16 in the 1960s, rising to 29 a decade later. By the 1980s there were 44 weather related disasters and in the past decade 70. </p> <p>The big insurance companies found that only six of the 40 worst insured losses between 1970 and 1999 were not weather related. Swiss Re, one of the world's biggest reinsurance companies, calculates that even taking inflation, population growth and increased global wealth into account, economic losses due to natural disasters doubled in the 20 years after 1970. </p> <p>Jennifer Morgan, director of WWF Climate Change Campaign, which commissioned the report, said: \"The risk of destabilising the earth's climate system is growing every day. Time is not on our side.\" </p> <p>Among examples in the report are two winter storms in Europe in 1999 which caused insured damage totalling \u00a33bn and flooding along the Yangtze river in 1998 that caused 4,000 deaths and losses of \u00a320bn.</p>",
  "<p>It seems that Manchester United can hardly put a foot wrong these days - either on the pitch or in the boardroom. </p> <p>Football's Premier League champion, already the world's richest club, seems to have the Midas touch with every move it makes. Such is the intense interest in its exploits that any event, rumour or suggestion will have an immediate impact on the share price.</p> <p>Yesterday was no exception. On the strength of reports that the club was poised to sign a \u00a3300m sportswear deal with Nike, its stock price initially rocketed 10%, eventually settling down to end the day unchanged at 258p.</p> <p>The 15-year deal, rumoured to be announced along with full-year results on Monday, would earn the club \u00a320m per season.</p> <p>For those wanting to buy into the north-west's success story, now could be a wise time to reach for the cheque book. Although the price is certainly not at bargain levels, the feeling is that this stock is ready to climb. It is way off its 438p year high, although comfortably ahead of the low of 193p.</p> <p>With success on the pitch practically taken for granted - despite this week's stumble against PSV Eindhoven in the Champions' league - the financial support from the Old Trafford faithful will be maintained.</p> <p>The global following Manchester United attracts means the team has access to retail sales far in excess of rivals - a key factor in long-term growth.</p> <p>The downsides for United are, generally speaking, out of their control. One of the biggest threats, although not in the short term, is a shake-up of the transfer system being considered by Uefa, European football's governing body.</p> <p>This would hand far more power to the players which, it is feared, would lead to demands for the already sky-high wages to be pushed even higher.</p>",
  "<p>The weather is changing. Yes, we've all heard of global warming, but what's that got to do with telly? The weather is really changing because the BBC, that pioneer of the chubbiest cloud symbols in the western hemisphere, is revamping its weather bulletins. From next week, in will come groovy 3D graphics designed to \"give the weather its own identity\". And what's more, weather updates will look the same whether you see them on BBC1, BBC2, BBC Online, News 24 or BBC World (and if you know what that is you probably enjoy really nice weather as you'll be living abroad). </p> <p>For the Beeb, global warming means new challenges that need to be reflected in the 21st century. Long gone are magnetic raindrops liable to slip off the map at the slightest over-excited gesture from a \"weather-caster\". </p> <p>Instead, we'll be treated to a \"fly-by view\" account of the prevailing winds using Jurassic Park-inspired technology. Yes, really! Expect scenes of teeny figures running for cover from raptor-like twisters in the east Midlands. Don't expect Richard Attenborough. </p> <p>Even more compelling, the weather reports will feature more detail than ever about humidity and other potential horrors, including - and this is public service for you - tree pollen. </p> <p>The new look goes live next week, but meanwhile the Beeb is still recruiting more than 50 new presenters. They're being asked to audition for the top spots and are being put through their paces in true BBC style. While they don't have to be meteorological experts, every would-be presenter is asked to give a general prediction on the basis of a spoof weather map. And here's the clincher - of several people who went for auditions from the BBC's own ranks, only one of them thought to ask what time of year the map was supposed to relate to. Would you have passed the test? </p> <p>Lucy Rouse is editor of Broadcast Magazine.</p>",
  "The Royal Shakespeare Company is inviting metropolitan theatre critics to abandon the comforts of London and Stratford-upon-Avon to attend a first night in a sports hall 200 miles north of Euston. <p>Adrian Noble, the RSC's artistic director, has written to critics urging them to attend the national press night of a production in a leisure centre in Macclesfield, Cheshire. </p> <p>The Tempest opens on January 18 and launches the RSC's 21st mobile tour, which takes in 20 British towns, including Telford, St Austell in Cornwall, and Northallerton in North Yorkshire, plus Budapest, Lisbon, Porto and Virginia. </p> <p>The company takes to the road in five trucks laden with 500 seats, a lighting rig, sets and costumes, and sets up in halls in places which see little live theatre. Many in the audience will be seeing their first Shakespeare play. </p> <p>The Tempest will be seen at the Pit in London and The Other Place in Stratford before it hits the road, but Mr Noble is urging critics not to head for their familiar seats. \"I very much want you to experience the production in the environment for which it is particularly designed,\" he writes. \"The encounter you will have of the performances is a completely different experience to seeing it in one of our London or Stratford theatres.\" </p> <p>So far only two national newspaper journalists have accepted Mr Noble's invitation. \"The rest are probably still in shock and wondering where Macclesfield is,\" said a company spokeswoman. </p> <p>Yesterday Mr Noble said the tour had for 21 years taken plays by Shakespeare and others to places with little or no theatrical tradition. \"Over the years, we have found that there has been a richness of response, a sense of the circus coming to town. </p> <p>\"In the tour's early days, productions were not seen in London or Stratford, and London critics did not come unless the tour stopped close to the capital, such as in Milton Keynes. </p> <p>\"We are a national company, and it would be a good thing if national newspaper critics could watch the company carry out an important part of its national responsibilities.\"</p>",
  "<p>A distressing picture of human activities pushing an ever increasing number of mammals, birds, trees and plants to the brink of extinction is published today in the internationally recognised \"red list\" of endangered species. </p> <p>Gorillas, the Iberian lynx, some species of dolphins, eagles, eight types of freshwater turtles and 16 types of albatross are all disappearing. </p> <p>The 2000 list, the most comprehensive look at the chances of survival of everything from the great whales to humble mosses, concludes that mankind is causing extinctions at 50 times the natural rate. </p> <p>The four-yearly report shows that 11 mammals have slipped into the critically endangered category since 1996, and one monkey, Miss Waldron's red colobus, has not been seen despite extensive searches in the Ivory Coast and Ghana. </p> <p>The report says: \"The global extinction crisis is as bad as or worse than believed, with dramatic declines of many species, including reptiles and primates.\" </p> <p>Around a quarter of all reptiles, one in five amphibians and one in three freshwater fish are described as threatened. But the report says that many plants and animals are probably becoming extinct before they have time to be discovered and properly described. </p> <p>Species in danger are placed in categories. Most enter the red list by being classed as threatened, which means they face a high risk of extinction in the near future. There are 11,046 plants and animals in this category. One in four mam mal species and one in eight of all birds is now red listed. </p> <p>Critically endangered means extinction is close. Falling into this category is the Cross River gorilla. There are only 150 to 200 left in dense forest on the Nigerian/Cameroon border. </p> <p>Another is the Philippine eagle, down from an original population of 6,000 to between 350 and 600. The old growth forest on which it depends for survival is being cut down. The World Conservation Union, which compiles the list, believes that if the eagle can be saved so too can 27 other species of bird in the same forest also heading for extinction. </p> <p>Indonesia, India, Brazil and China are among the countries with the most threatened mammals and birds, while plant species are declining fastest in central and west Africa and south-east Asia. </p> <p>But Europe is not immune. The Iberian lynx is down to 600 survivors, mainly in Spain, because of loss of habitat. </p> <p>In the UK, the red squirrel has suffered a crash in population, and the small eyed ray has been killed in large numbers by trawl nets. The common sturgeon, which if caught round British coasts is supposed to be delivered to the Queen, is so critically endangered from overfishing for its caviar in the Baltic that she will be lucky to see one again. </p> <p>Also threatened in the UK are 11 varieties of Sorbus, a small tree with red berries, because their habitat has been destroyed by limestone quarrying. One, Sorbus bristoliensis, lives only in the Avon Gorge in Somerset and there are only about 100 plants in all. </p> <p>Craig Hilton-Taylor, the Cambridge based scientist who compiled the list, described his job as the most depressing in the world. </p> <p> He said: \"It is depressing at times. Sometimes there does seem to be no hope, but unless we find out what is happening it is difficult to know what to do about it and what our priorities should be.\" </p> <p>But there are glimmers of hope.

  "I am sure Faisal Bodi enjoyed the flourish of his comments on me and others (Don't label me, please, September 28) when he wrote that we claimed, without justification, to represent \"black\" people and that we wanted to melt society down in cooking pots. But let me just remind him of a few basic and very easily checked facts. <p>First, I do not represent anyone. I am a journalist and writer. I talk to people and have ideas of my own. Second, in all my writing, including in my columns this month, I have consistently argued against simplistic assumptions about politics and \"black\" representation, although I feel strongly that all our institutions remain too white. Finally, the only thing that unites Darcus Howe, Lee Jasper and myself is that we refuse to be confined to pre-destined identities (unlike Bodi who sees himself entirely in terms of an idealised Muslim identity), and that we have taken our ideas out of the ghetto and into the wider arena of national life.

  "<p>What year is it anyway? 2000 or 1973? It was a little hard to tell from last weekend's box office receipts. The two most successful movies - The Exorcist and Almost Famous - were originally released and retrospectively set in the year that Opec fuel price rises put a sudden end to the longest economic boom in history (hey, wait a minute...), a year characterised by global political unrest and a sense that our elected leaders were either totally clueless or totally corrupt. </p> <p>Turned out they were both. So, give or take the intervening invention of the VCR, the DVD, the microchip and all its satanic progeny, the bottomless depths of public cynicism that currently afflict the political process and the absence of the Vietnam war, and it's easy to understand how those of us with longer memories - those of us who only watched the Nixon funeral to make absolutely sure he was dead - might start getting confused. </p> <p>The Exorcist - which made $165m on its original release - was wheeled out in a slightly doctored form and hoovered up a very tasty $12m, with a per-screen average that spelled packed house. The posters and the ad campaign both refer breathlessly to \"the version you've never seen\" because director William Friedkin - or perhaps Warner Bros - has finally agreed to incorporate scenes, removed from the release version, that Catholic writer William Peter Blatty insisted lent the story a more spiritual, humanising tone, but which the Jewish Friedkin felt slowed things down in dramatic terms. </p> <p>So this is not so much the director's cut as the writer's version, although Friedkin supervised the new assembly. With his own career currently in a holding pattern that suggests the perils of being married to the head of the studio (in his case, glammy Paramount chief Sherry Lansing), Friedkin has decided to back down over matters he didn't seem interested in at the time of 1998's 25th anniversary restoration. One wonders if the addition of the Blatty scenes - the best of which is a shot of Linda Blair doing a bent-spine backwards crabwalk down a flight of stairs - isn't just a matter of the studio gilding the re-released lily for all it's worth. </p> <p>I have problems with the whole notion of the \"director's cut\". Apart from its sense of a totally coherent, fully realised future environment, I never much liked Blade Runner, no matter what Ridley Scott did to improve it. The original was both clarified and muddied by Harrison Ford's lugubrious film noir voiceover. Yet the narration did clarify things and when it was removed for the reissue, parts of the movie became incoherent unless you'd already seen the original - now, as part of the resale process, downgraded to \"flawed masterpiece \", the better to convince us we were getting more bang for our now twice-spent dollar. </p> <p>Similarly with Sam Peckinpah's Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid, which was butchered by the head of MGM in an undisguised act of animosity toward the famously truculent director. The re-release also removed moments that were among the best in the original version, leading critic Paul Seydor to suggest that whatever it was, it wasn't \"Peckinpah's version\", not least because the director himself was now six feet under. </p> <p>Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid was also released in 1973, which tends to inhibit nostalgia for the studios of the period. That's not something likely to deter Cameron Crowe, whose semi-autobiographical Almost Famous recreates the summer of that year, when the 15-year-old Crowe did his first assignments for Rolling Stone magazine, which had no idea of his tender age. As with all of Crowe's movies, it's not until after you've left the movie house that you begin to realise all the emotional manipulations you've been subjected to, and how Crowe's slickness - and, I think, emotional dishonesty - have managed to trick you. </p> <p>Almost Famous is less culpable in this regard than Jerry Maguire, but thinking of 1973 and witnessing the Exorcist's renewed success, one starts wishing they'd just suspend the entire studio production schedule and re-release all the great lost movies of that period, like Monte Hellman's Cockfighter, Arthur Penn's Night Moves, Ivan Passer's Cutter's Way and Karel Reisz's Who'll Stop The Rain. And if the writers' actors' and directors' strikes all kick in over the next year and production does dry up and lead to blank screens then, God knows, we might see it happen yet.</p> <p><strong> Jan Michael Vincent: Hollywood's most indefatigable drunk</strong></p> <p>That list of celebrity party-boys who become celebrity jailbirds just keeps growing. We've had poor, blitzed Robert Downey Jr, who celebrated his recent release by taking a job on Ally McBeal. Then there was Christian Slater, who bit a cop who was trying to arrest the errant actor for drunkenly hitting his wife. Charlie Sheen is infamous for his hop-headed, bed-hopping shenanigans (his probation is administered by the same exasperated Malibu judge who jailed Downey) and ageing pretty boy Rick Springfield was recently charged with knocking his missus about. None of them however, can hold a candle to Hollywood's most indefatigable drunk, Jan Michael Vincent, whose 25-year-old battle with the hop and the grape has, perhaps inevitably, now landed the gin-blossomed former Airwolf star in chokey. </p> <p>One can see Vincent's entire decline mapped out in John Milius's Nietzschean 1978 surfer movie Big Wednesday, in which Vincent - already a major booze ghoul - played a legendary surfer who's an alcoholic before he leaves his teens. </p> <p>His incarceration stems from repeated violations of his probation on previous charges of public drunkenness and domestic violence. Having been found rolling around incoherently on a sidewalk in Santa Monica in January, Vincent was faced with six months inside; he was then arrested for pulling his long-suffering wife's hair and pushing her about, making his 60-day sentence inevitable. </p> <p>Vincent broke his neck in a drunken 1996 car wreck and then sued the paramedics who'd saved his life but damaged his vocal cords (his voice is now just a rasp). </p> <p>He'd also faced charges of kicking one girlfriend in the stomach when she was pregnant. He'll go directly from his live-in detox mansion to the Big House, where his now hideously addled looks will no doubt prove a useful deterrent to predators in the showers. </p> <p> <strong> Bankrupt Anna hits back</strong><br> </p> <p> \"This is not about a gold-digger sucking money. This is about a relationship that was very profound.\" Pardon me for smirking at these words from the attorney who is helping bankrupt Playboy centrefold Anna Nicole Smith to contest the will of her late oil billionaire husband Howard Marshall. Smith was a 26-year-old stripper when she was courted by the octogenarian. She claims she lived in wedded bliss for 14 months before his death, aged 90, in August 1995, and that he promised her half of his fortune, estimated at between $60m and $1.6bn. She got nothing. Smith is broke after losing $850,000 in a sexual harassment case brought by a former female assistant. </p> <p><strong> King's grief for van driver</strong><br> </p> <p>Stephen King expressed sadness this week about the death of the man who accidentally ran him over last year and nearly killed the writer - in a scenario that eerily resembled the opening of his novel Misery. King had been gently critical of the decision not to jail Smith or revoke his licence after the accident, but later contented himself with buying Smith's wrecked van and promptly destroying it with a sledge-hammer once he was fit. An autopsy was unable to determine the cause of death. </p> <p><strong> Sweet smell gone sour</strong><br> </p> <p>And a tiny titbit for fans of the classic 1958 Burt Lancaster-Tony Curtis movie Sweet Smell of Success, in which Lancaster plays a powerful Broadway columnist who has a semi-incestuous relationship with his sister, played by the otherwise unknown actress Susan Harrison. Harrison turns out to be the mother of Darva Conger, who helped the Fox network plumb new depths of tastelessness when she won a husband on the special Who Wants To Marry A Millionaire? She divorced him almost immediately after he was accused of beating up an ex-girlfriend. Conger then stripped for Hef, and is now said to be dating TV scandal-monger and possible NYC mayoral candidate Geraldo Rivera. Maybe John Cusack will put her in his Sweet Smell remake.</p>",
  "<p> From somewhere on a spectrum between Kes and How Green Was My Valley, the British stage director Stephen Daldry brings us Billy Elliot, his screen debut. This is a bold, attractive and emotionally generous film about a young boy growing up in the north-east during the miners' strike of 1984-85, who discovers in himself a talent for dance. And - to the horror of his striking miner father, played by the perennially excellent Gary Lewis - this is not even the virile and masculine dance of Gene Kelly. It is ballet: mincing, prancing, flouncing tutu-wearing ballet, and young Billy (Jamie Bell) has to work on his pli\u00e9s along with all the girlies in a church hall where Dad sends him every week with his 50p sub in his hot little hand on the understanding that he is learning how to box. </p> <p>This is a film with a lot of charm, a lot of humour and a lot of heart. Daldry's direction and the screenplay by Lee Hall (who wrote the radio drama hit Spoonface Steinberg) distinguish themselves further in the discreet, intelligent way they deal with the question of Billy's nascent sexuality, avoiding vulgarity and prurience. The young male ballet dancer is not a stereotype, and yet the film certainly does not feel it necessary to reassure the audience that Billy is straight; for my money, that's part of this picture's liberal humanity. </p> <p>Billy finds himself in his embarrassing predicament when he is perpetually having the living daylights knocked out of him in the ring, unhappily wearing the seedy old boxing gloves that were once the property of his grandfather. Something in him responds to the sight of the ballet class in the opposite corner. He joins in, coming under the wing of the teacher, Mrs Wilkinson, played by Julie Walters, who in some ways is playing a version of the Michael Caine role in Educating Rita. She sees that dance, with its soaring language of the human spirit, might be Billy's ticket out of here. </p> <p>In Billy Elliot, dance is at once an expression of yearning, and a symptom of frustration; Mrs Wilkinson is described as \"unfulfilled - that's why she does dancing!\" Julie Walters could so easily have given an over-egged and gamey performance as the gutsy mentor, and it is a measure of her intelligence as a performer and Daldry's assurance as a director, that her approach is kept within bounds. There is a very good sequence where she and Billy do a dance routine that she has devised for him to I Love to Boogie by T Rex: and this scene nicely complements a later moment where Billy does his own dance of rage in the street when his Dad forbids him to dance again. </p> <p>It is a spontaneous choreography of frustration, which hovers between the world of realistic drama and the stylised world of the musical. But the action of Billy Elliot deepens as his father, at first infuriated, comes to accept his son's talent, and that some money must be found to enable him to audition for the Royal Ballet School. With a terrible clarity, it dawns on him that this means breaking the strike, and joining the cowering blacklegs who are bussed in through the picket lines every morning. </p> <p>So from questioning his ballet-loving son's masculinity, Billy's dad arrives at his own male crisis. The use of the strike is very studied: the period of Billy's first timid dance steps to his fateful audition covers the strike period almost exactly. By casting this momentous and traumatic event in British history as a backdrop to a young boy's growing pains, Daldry is, arguably, open to the charge of sentimentalising intractable political issues - and from a feminist perspective, there is not much to cheer about in the story of a boy who turns out to be much better than all the girls, and entirely monopolises his teacher's attention. </p> <p>Occasionally, the background furniture is pedantic, and a little baffling. Along with T Rex, we have a Ker-Plunk under Billy's bed and the inevitable Spacehopper - all shorthand for the 70s, rather than the 80s. But the incidental details are sketched in with flair and wit: there's a nice moment when Mrs Wilkinson's daughter Debbie is sauntering with Billy down the street and idly bangs a stick along the row of policemen's perspex riot shields, like railings. It couldn't happen in real life - but it's such a funny and surreal moment, of a piece with Daldry's amiable and buoyant direction. Billy Elliot has a freshness that makes it a pleasure to watch; it's a very emphatic success.</p>"
