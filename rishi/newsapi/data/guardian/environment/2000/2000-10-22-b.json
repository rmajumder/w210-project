  "<p><strong>Shadows of a Princess: Diana, Princess of Wales 1987-1996</strong><br>PD Jephson<br>HarperCollins \u00a317.99, pp400<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000407769,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p> You already know the story of the princess and the pea. This book is the story of the princess and the penile substitute. Or rather - for fear I might have made you want to read it - one paragraph tells that short, sadly pointless story. The rest is about the princess and a pea-brained employee who fawned on her, forgave her trespasses, cried for her and now seeks to profit from defaming her. </p> <p>Back, however, to the dildo. Diana, Jephson breathlessly confides, returned from Paris in 1992 sporting a souvenir - 'a large, pink, battery-powered vibrator'. By now she knew she'd never get her hands on an orb or sceptre: this plastic knob would have to do. It had 'the aim', Jephson notes with courtly tact, 'of raising royal morale at critical moments'. But he denies that it was actually aimed at the critical royal part, and insists it was 'never used for its designed purpose'. Eventually Dodi assumed the role of royal morale-booster, which made the cheeky pink chap redundant. </p> <p>Meanwhile, it's curious that Diana should have felt she needed this bulbous, buzzing personal attendant. After all, she already had Jephson, who was her private secretary during the decade covered by his book, and he saw himself as a dildo in a pin-stripe suit. When he took the job, a courtier seasoned in sycophancy warned him: 'To these people you're just a toy. They'll wind you up and watch you whizz all over the place, then they'll throw you away and get another one.' </p> <p>Jephson prided himself for a while on being Diana's 'current favourite toy', and even aspired to function as a marital aid - rather than a bureaucratic aide - for the estranged Waleses. A few days after Diana acquired the dildo, Jephson smarmed into Charles's office to remind him: 'I joined this household to serve both Your Royal Highnesses.' But Charles had mentally metamorphosed himself into a snuggly sanitary pad, and Jephson's ministrations could hardly be counted on, since his batteries were starting to go flat.</p> <p>He resigned in 1996, petulant about Diana's secret Panorama interview. That, at least, is how he tells it. In fact, Diana executed him electronically by sending him a malevolent anonymous message on his pager. Jephson could no longer claim to be her best-beloved toy, her faithful and indefatigable stand-by; she had reduced him to the size of the transistorised gadget which stirred to life in his trouser pocket. Life, alas, would never be quite so vibrant again. </p> <p>Jephson piously professes to regard Diana as 'a global force for good', though his account of her kills the poor woman all over again. The charities she adopted, he makes clear, were excuses for foreign junkets; she used public money to subsidise her career as an 'independent celebrity'. Her temper was vile, her humour crude, and her laugh asinine. Jephson, impeccably proper, winces when her braying reaches 'the delicate ears of outsiders such as Queen's Flight crews'. </p> <p>Despite her global frolics, Diana hadn't the foggiest about the destinations to which her private planes - jet-propelled vibrators, if you come to think of it - were headed. At the White House just before the Gulf War, George Bush p\u00e8re asked her about the invasion of Kuwait. The opinion she vouchsafed was a meditative 'Um'. Jephson rejoices in her embarrassment, but reserves his haughtiest outrage for a more clandestine vice, her addiction to chocolate. 'I frequently watched her eat a whole bar of fruit-and-nut between engagements,' he reveals, and pauses to listen to us gasp. </p> <p>He is slavishly discreet, by contrast, about the elder Windsors, who are alive and liable to sue. Reneging on his contract to supply title-tattle, he opaquely paraphrases their dialogue. Charles, infuriated by Diana's refusal to spend a weekend at Sandringham, expressed his annoyance - Jephson informs us - 'in blunt and peremptory tones'. We are left to imagine the four-letter words the heir actually used. The evasion is characteristic of this cowardly book, too hyprocritically high-minded to get down to its job of scandal-mongering. </p> <p>Though he disdains his mistress, Jephson has a lofty opinion of himself. Describing how he supported Diana against her detractors at St James's Palace, he positively glows as the memory of his chivalry: 'If all this sounds rather overprincipled, then it probably was.' He admires the Queen's stoical immunity to emotion, and boasts of sharing it: between them, they uphold 'so many of the great British strengths which had withstood all the tests that Empire and war could bring'. He is also deeply, nauseatingly religious. When Diana jabs him with that message on his pager, he 'told nobody of my agonised thoughts except God. He had heard most of it before'. Now, thanks to Jephson's book, God generously shares this privileged information with everyone who reads a tabloid. </p> <p>Unplugged by the princess, Jephson apparently 'decided to take up writing'. He had served his apprenticeship ghosting thank-you notes for Diana, so he is proficient at ornately arranging clich\u00e9s. She and Charles, exchanging insults, remind him of pots and kettles. She wants to have her cake and eat it, while sipping from a poisoned chalice. Jephson adds a pinch of salt when she gossips about her adulterous in-laws. For a while, she rides the crest of a wave, though a straw finally breaks the camel's back.</p> <p>Sometimes, Jephson makes his catchphrases copulate. Thus the last meeting between the separate staffs of the Waleses is 'the merest fig leaf, the fag end of a process'. Just try to picture that: a fag posing as a fig. The vibrator rears its pert head on page 267. Otherwise, there is no reason at all to read this empty, imperceptive and crassly opportunistic book.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Civilisations </strong><br>Felipe Fernandez-Armesto<br>Macmillan \u00a325, pp636</p> <p>Once, 'civilisation' was an easy word. It was about how you held your tea-cup, treated your captive, scanned your Alexandrine or flushed away your excrement. Now the term has fallen apart, its fragments stained with subjectivism. As Felipe Fernandez-Armesto says: 'All definitions seem vitiated... I am civilised, you belong to a culture, he is a barbarian.' </p> <p>He is the most urbane of historians. This is one of those fashionable encyclopaedia-scale tomes (and he has written a few before), but whenever the going gets tough the author jumps forward to charm his reader: witty, sometimes sharply original, often in a gust of rage. Felipe has no patience with prayerful stuff about Western Christian civilisation. 'We Western Europeans are the dregs of Eurasian history and our lands are the sump into which that history has drained.' So is the civilisation word worth keeping at all? And if it is, how should we use it? </p> <p>Felipe (for short, but not for lack of respect) admits that it is a 'Western' word. The imperial connotations - 'I am civilised, they are barbarians' - simply cannot be rinsed out of it. So why use it when, as he says himself, 'a society' or 'a culture' would do the job better? He derides so-called 'polythetic' definitions of civilisation which set up a checklist of attributes such as cities, writing, metallurgy, division of labour and so on. But then, arbitrarily enough, he selects his own definition. Civilisation is what can happen when humans significantly change their environment: 'a relationship between one species and the rest of nature'. </p> <p>So the book is divided up into environments (the wastelands of 'desert, tundra, ice', the grasslands, the rain-forests, the mountain plateaux and valleys, the alluvial river-lands and so forth), and into accounts of how human beings managed or failed to transform their landscapes and seascapes. This is why the book does not run chronologically, until the final eruption of European culture and settlement across the globe forces an inevitable climax. </p> <p>The borderline for Felipe runs between societies which adapt themselves to their surroundings and those which adapt their surroundings. For instance, the medieval Scandinavian settlers who arrived in Greenland established farms on the wintry barrens and built churches of local stone, but the Thule people who entered the region at around the same time came with light umiak boats and hunted over the ice with dog-teams. Ancestors of the Inuit, they survived climatic changes in this extreme environment, while the ambitious and landscape-refashioning European colony did not. </p> <p>Simply to adapt and stay alive in tundra, swamp or desert may be a much more remarkable achievement than building a city among temperate woodlands. Felipe cites the horrible environment of Frederik Hendrik Island, off New Guinea, a sludge of mud and mosquitoes in which humans improbably invented a sustainable way of living on artificial mounds elaborately layered and manured for a variety of crops. And yet swamps no less repellent generated some of the first urban cultures in Central America. </p> <p>Civilisations is anything but a hymn to progress. Felipe insists that there is nothing necessarily virtuous or inevitable about changes in material culture. 'If the environment works for you, why fix it?' He quotes the agronomist Jack Harlan, who pointed out the apparent senselessness of moving from a hunter-gatherer economy to settled agriculture. Hunter-gatherers were healthier, less vulnerable to the weather and worked much less hard. In the same way, the Industrial Revolution saw millions of people exchange a bad rural life for a far worse life in the new cities. It doesn't help to use the word 'advance' to describe these changes, as if the shift to greater complexity were planned. </p> <p>Maybe intensive agriculture did not begin as an innovation for feeding more people, but started as a religious rite to do with death and the earth. Maybe the people who landed up in alluvial flood-plains arrived as unwilling refugees from lost hunting-grounds; they may have built drainage channels and dams simply to protect themselves, and only later discovered that these could be used to irrigate huge and regular crops. </p> <p>Felipe never allows himself to grow bored with his material. None the less, a historian so lively is bound to find some tracts of world history less exciting than others. His sections on the classical world miss some targets. Surely it would have suited his 'relationship with nature' thesis to discuss how Black Sea dried fish made the Graeco-Roman empires possible. And what about the theory that those empires only happened because the early city-states exploited the fragile Mediterranean soils to death and were forced to expand into Gaul, North Africa or the Levant?</p> <p>The author's archaeology can be a bit dated too. Diffusionism (the idea that all cultural developments radiated from a single centre by migration or conquest) has not been 'orthodoxy' for a long time. And why does he use the archaic Wade-Giles spelling for Chinese names? </p> <p>He is at his best in three places: the medieval African states of the Sahel, the opening-up of the Atlantic and the history of the Indian Ocean. 'The precocity of the Indian Ocean as a zone of long-range navigation and cultural exchange is one of the glaring facts of history', made possible by the 'reversible escalator' of the monsoons. Roman, Chinese and Arab trading fleets cruised between the opulent coastal cities of the region, which remained a 'civilised' zone until Vasco da Gama smashed his way into it in 1498. (I cannot understand why Felipe is so charitable to this brutish terrorist.) Soon the coastal states of Europe learnt to 'crack the code' of the Atlantic winds, and a new 'Western' culture arose on both sides of the ocean. </p> <p>But in the twentieth century that 'Atlantic civilisation' discharged an avalanche of cruelty and destruction. Asking himself 'why progress failed', Felipe suggests that the failure is almost as much an illusion as progress itself. The truth was that human beneficence had been badly over-estimated. And at the end of this long display of learning and passionate intelligence, he sums up: 'If you misrepresent civilisation as progressive, you are bound to disappoint people... scratch it and savagery bleeds out.'</p>",
  "<p>Europe's biggest glacier is about to disintegrate. The mighty Breidamerkurj\u00f6kull in southern Iceland is breaking apart and will slide into the north Atlantic in the next few years.</p> <p>Researchers' discovery of the imminent destruction of this gigantic river of ice demonstrates starkly that global warming is now making a serious impact on the northern hemisphere, threatening to melt ice caps and raise sea levels round the world.</p> <p>The grim revelation will be seized upon by green activists who believe that industrial gas emissions are responsible for heating the planet's atmosphere. If the continent's biggest glacier is falling apart, they ask, what further catastrophes await us?</p> <p>The break-up of Breidamerkurj\u00f6kull also threatens to destroy a key Icelandic beauty spot. Each year hordes of visitors take boat trips around the dozens of icebergs that regularly 'calve' from the glacier and festoon the lake at its base. Moviemakers have used the breathtaking location for a host of films, including the James Bond adventure A View to a Kill, and the forthcoming Tomb Raider, starring Angelina Jolie.</p> <p>But now silt and sediment - which have already started to pour from the melting glacier - are likely to fill up the lake, destroying this remarkable beauty spot.</p> <p>'The glacier has been shrinking for most of the twentieth century,' said Dr David Evans, of Glasgow University. 'However it is clear it is now approaching the point where a great mass of it will break up, and pour down to the sea. When it does, J\u00f6kulsarlon will probably fill up with sediment.'</p> <p>Breidamerkurj\u00f6kull is the main glacier emanating from the massive Vatnaj\u00f6kull ice sheet that covers much of southern Iceland, and has been studied intensively for the past century, beginning in 1903 when map makers recorded that its icy snout rested only a few hundred yards from the sea.</p> <p>By 1945 United States military cartographers had found it had receded a further few hundred yards from the coast.</p> <p>Then, in 1965, Glasgow University surveyors arrived to make new maps of Breidamerkurj\u00f6kull and found the glacier had slipped back from the sea by a couple of miles.</p> <p>This survey was followed up in 1998 when another team from Glasgow began a new survey using global positioning satellite equipment and other high-precision devices.</p> <p>For the past two years researchers Yvonne Finlayson and Mike Shand, from the university's geography department, have been collating this data. They have completed a detailed topographic map of the region.</p> <p>The results are startling. They show the great river of ice has dwindled dramatically over the past 30 years. This recession has revealed a giant portion of the huge fjord - once covered completely by the glacier - has now been exposed as Breidamerkurj\u00f6kull's snout has retreated more than five miles from the sea.</p> <p>But detailed analysis of the glacier has revealed an even more disturbing picture. The Glasgow team - working with Loughborough University researchers led by David Twigg - says a huge depression has formed over the glacier's frozen heart. This hole rests over the portion of the inland fjord still covered by ice. </p> <p>'Effectively, the glacier is breaking up around that hole and is slipping into the fjord,' said Evans. 'It is beginning to disintegrate and in the next few years will collapse into the water.'</p> <p>The disappearance of a massive ice floe that once coated a large area of the Icelandic coast is a stark demonstration of the increasing impact global warming is having on the planet. The question is: to what extent is humanity responsible for this heating, and what further impact will it have on Earth?</p> <p>Many environmentalists point out that industrial emissions have allowed carbon dioxide to build up in the atmosphere to dangerous levels. Sunlight is being trapped by this carbon dioxide and causing the planet to warm. One estimate suggests the Arctic has warmed by 6\u00b0C in the past 30 years, while its ice covering has dropped from 10ft to 6ft.</p> <p>Atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide have doubled in the past century, just as global temperatures have risen. The effects can be seen everywhere, green activists say, including Breidamerkurj\u00f6kull.</p> <p>But such alarmist visions have to be tempered with knowledge about the past behaviour of Iceland's glaciers. In the seventeenth century the coastal land around Breidamerkurj\u00f6kull was ice-free and farmed quite intensively by local people. Cattle and sheep grazed, and barley and wheat were grown.</p> <p>Then, in the early decades of the eighteenth century, the climate grew colder and giant tongues of ice emerged from the Vatnaj\u00f6kull sheet, including the Breidamerkurj\u00f6kull glacier. These moved inexorably down to the coast, covering pastures and crushing farmhouses that lay in their path.</p> <p>'This period is known as the Little Ice Age and it lasted almost 200 years, reaching its peak, in Iceland, in 1890, when Breidamerkurj\u00f6kull got closest to the sea,' said Evans.</p> <p>'That mini-ice age is over now, and the climate has been getting warmer for the past 100 years. Hence the shrinking and disintegration of the glacier.'</p> <p>In the past 30 years, old farmlands have reappeared around Breidamerkurj\u00f6kull - most of it pockmarked with holes gouged by receding glaciers. </p> <p>Local people have already moved on to this land and begun cropping grass and grazing sheep. 'The land is simply being returned to its old use,' said Evans.</p> <p>Whether this restoration of agricultural land and the loss of the glacier is being triggered solely by natural climatic variation, or is being speeded up by the effects of man pumping industrial gases into the atmosphere, has yet to be determined. </p> <p>Either way, the fate of Breidamerkurj\u00f6kull is our starkest warning that global warming now has a direct impact on our continent. The heat is on, whether we like it or not.</p> <p> <strong>Tell-tale signs</strong></p> <p>Other indicators of global warming are: </p> <p> <strong> \u0095 Winter </strong> is in retreat. Europe's growing season is 11 days longer than it was 35 years ago. </p> <p> <strong> \u0095 </strong> <strong> Sea levels</strong> have crept higher throughout the last century at the rate of a millimetre a year. </p> <p> <strong> \u0095 Hot summers</strong>.

  "<p>When his more liberal-minded friends tax Tony Blair for grovelling to right-wing newspapers, the Prime Minister answers the charge of appeasement with a pained frown that begs for understanding and offers this plea in mitigation. 'I haven't given them what they really want,' Blair has been heard to say of the Sun, Daily Mail, the Times and Telegraph. 'I haven't ruled out the euro.' </p> <p>Not yet he hasn't. But for how much longer will he resist the siren voices urging the Prime Minister to give the Europhobes what they really want? To declare against membership of the single currency is the one act that would be most certain to secure extension of his Faustian bargain with crucial segments of the right-wing press. And since he invests, however misguidedly, so much importance in that constituency, the Prime Minister would also regard it as the one act most guaranteed to secure a solid majority for his second term. </p> <p>The price - and this is why he has so far resisted the temptation - would be the final and comprehensive ruination of his strategy towards Europe. No longer would the Prime Minister be able to look Jacques Chirac and Gerhard Schr\u00f6der in the eye as he tells them of his long-term intent to make Britain a good European. Not unless he enjoys being laughed at in French and German. I'm told that Wim Kok, the Prime Minister of Holland and one of his closer friends on the Continent, is bored stiff listening to Mr Blair's private excuses that he would be in the single currency already were it not for Britain's phobic media. To rule out membership of the euro would consign Mr Blair to the dismal fate that he pledged would never happen when he said that 'under my leadership' Britain would 'never be isolated or left behind in Europe'. </p> <p>But then, he is already becoming isolated and left behind, having conceded to the French and German desire to create a fast-track European \u00e9lite based on the members of the euro-zone. In the capitals of the Continent, they begin to talk of him as yet another British Prime Minister who promised so much only to prove to be an inconstant, semi-detached, second-division partner. That disillusion will be reinforced by the Prime Minister's remarks uttered 'in the margins' - as it is appropriately reported - of the Euro-Asia summit in Seoul. 'If you came along to me with an opinion poll and said, \"Do you want to join the euro today?\", I would say no.' </p> <p>Had Tony Blair previously behaved less like a respondent to an opinion poll and performed more like a leader, he might not be so horribly impaled on his European dilemma. He is now further away than ever from the day that Britain ends its self-imposed exile from the heart of Europe, more remote from fulfilment of his self-perceived destiny of being a leader in Europe. The prospects of joining the euro early in the next parliament - still, in theory, the Prime Minister's policy - shrivel by the week. </p> <p>The five economic tests are balls, in the sense that they were schemed up by Ed Balls, the Chancellor's sceptical guide on the single currency, and also in the sense that they are bollocks. The real tests are the political hurdles and these look ever more unscalable. </p> <p>1: Is there sustainable convergence between the Prime Minister and the Chancellor? No: Gordon Brown's opposition to the euro is hardening, fired by his pride in his own economic framework and animated by his ambition to replace Tony Blair. There are quite a lot of sleeping Eurosceptics in the Cabinet, among them John Prescott, who makes it clear that he would insist on a Cabinet debate and - even more unheard of in this government - a vote around the table. </p> <p>2: Can the press be cured of its anti-European rabies? Ha! What Neil Kinnock calls the 'toxic' press will fight with a ferociousness that will make its treatment of Mr Kinnock when he was Labour leader seem gentle and generous. The forces of phobia in the press may gain another recruit if the Express group falls into the wrong hands. </p> <p>3: Is public opinion warming towards the euro? The reverse is the case. There is more antagonism towards the single currency, and more hostility towards Europe as a whole, than there was when New Labour came to office. </p> <p>4: Can a referendum be won? It is hard to quarrel with Bob Worcester, that veteran reader of the entrails of public opinion, that it now looks 'absolutely impossible' for the Government to convince Britain to embrace the single currency. </p> <p>5: In what circumstances would Tony Blair gamble his credibility as Prime Minister by taking on the right-wing press to call a referendum that all the pollsters tell him he would lose? None imaginable; Ian Paisley converting to Catholicism is more conceivable. </p> <p>As it becomes progressively less likely that Tony Blair will be able to take Britain into the single currency in the next parliament, so you begin to hear influential voices suggesting that he should make a virtue of necessity and rule it out. His Press Secretary, Alastair Campbell, is a gut euro-sceptic. The focus-group guru, Philip Gould, fears few things more than New Labour being out-flanked by the Tories on 'patriotic' issues. Robin Cook would resist the shift with all his might, but the Foreign Secretary's might is rather light, and his tenure at King Charles Street is not likely to be extended beyond the election. </p> <p>The Government's slide in a more sceptic direction has caused clouds of gloom to descend upon Peter Mandelson, who is, to his credit, the Cabinet's most consistent and most articulate pro-European, even when constantly menaced by assault from the Euro-hating press and battery by the Chancellor's bovver boys. </p> <p>Mandelson would fight ruling out the euro - but to the death? If the choice was between keeping open a diminishing euro option and being sure of re-election, Peter Mandelson would choose the latter. He it was who chose as Labour's last campaign mascot a bulldog, symbol not only of the phobic Right but of the skinhead Right. </p> <p>Rejecting the single currency for the next parliament is the one position possessed by William Hague which chimes with the views of the majority. It is planned by the Conservatives as a sharp weapon of their election campaigning. Should New Labour declare that it will not attempt to enter the euro in the next parliament, the Tory leader will have bags of fun crowing over a monumental U-turn and mocking the reverse as a severe humiliation for the Prime Minister. Though he would be right about that, Hague would weep many private tears. If the Labour and Tory approaches to the single currency become indistinguishable, Mr Hague will be left cradling a dead fox. His one popular posture will have been shot. His 'Save The \u00a3' van will be garaged for the indefinite future. He would then come under intense pressure from within his own party to harden the Tory position into a never to the single currency. Thus will British political debate ratchet even further in a Europhobic direction. </p> <p>The best guess is that Tony Blair will resist making an absolutely unequivocal statement ruling out the single currency. He will not want to acknowledge openly the defeat of his entire approach to Europe. He will want to reassure himself, as well as foreign investors, that Britain will still join at some time. On past form, there will be a series of nudges, winks and nods to the wise that time of entry is retreating into the mists of the shrouded future. Number 10 will let it be known that the Prime Minister regards it as increasingly less probable that Britain will join in the next parliament. Journalists will be encouraged to interpret this as meaning the euro is effectively ruled out. </p> <p>As was the case when he first came to power, so it is now: the single currency has never mattered as much to Tony Blair as his second term.</p>",
  "A few months ago I was on a news chat show with a reactionary pundit - Peter Hitchens, perhaps, or maybe Melanie Phillips, they all blur into one as I get older - and he or she was struck by the contrast between the decent British and the turbulent continentals. 'We remove our governments in free elections,' came the patriotic bellow. 'French presidents are brought down by mobs in the street.' <p>The line has since become a favourite charge against the European Union in our patriotic, foreign-owned press. It is probably useless to point out that no recent French government has been overthrown by revolutionary crowds. (Even General de Gaulle survived the student uprising of 1968. He resigned a year later after a bathetic defeat in a referendum on constitutional reform.) The supposedly docile British are far more incendiary. Striking miners lost Edward Heath the 1974 election as surely as the Winter of Discontent destroyed Jim Callaghan's chances in 1979. Poll-tax rioters and the refusal of millions to pay the hated charge persuaded the Tory Party to dump Margaret Thatcher. If you believe that Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom, and those on the Right who praise our passivity are quite adamant on this point, then you must admit that Britain has hosted a war which has taken 3,000 lives in the last 30 years and may not be over yet. No other Western European country has as many casualties of political violence. </p> <p>It is therefore conceivable that the fuel protesters will rip the guts out of the Government when their deadline runs out on 13 November. New Labour will have made concessions by then. But will a few pence off petrol tax or a cut in vehicle excise duty satisfy men drunk on the praise of William Hague and the Daily Mail ? Will they empty the roads again? Will a second blockade destroy Blair's reputation for competence? Will the gold Gordon Brown planned to stuff in the mouths of the electorate be wasted on deep cuts in fuel duty which will buy few votes if the oil cartel uses them as cover and raises its prices and profits? A wounded New Labour could stumble on like John Major's administration after the ERM disaster. Its nemesis would come on the day after the election when the voters awake to find William Hague in Downing Street, desperately hoping everyone has forgotten his promises to cut taxes and raise spending simultaneously. </p> <p>It could happen, but I suspect not. One of the pleasures of watching a culture which spends the national wealth of a medium-sized African country on probing public opinion is the joy of gloating at the failure of market researchers to second guess emotional surges. When Diana Spencer's car crashed, few predicted that millions would make fools of themselves by wailing for an aristocrat they had never met. The grieving process was embarrassingly brief. Moist newspaper supplements and TV specials were released to mark the first anniversary of the death 'that changed Britain for ever'. The readership and viewing figures were abysmal. Diana's mourners had dwindled into a small and rather sad cult. </p> <p>There are straws in the wind which suggest that the giddy roll from mass sympathy to indifference may hit the refinery protesters. Radio 5 Live is far better than any opinion poll at revealing the wisdom or alarming madness of your fellow citizens. During the blockade a large majority of callers were right behind direct action. The Fi Glover Show returned to the subject at the beginning of the month. David Handley, leader of Farmers for Action, the most militant group in the cheap-petrol lobby, was in the studio. He and everyone else was stunned by the near-unanimous abuse. 'You don't represent me.' 'You pocket my taxes.' 'I want to get to work/hospital/the children's day centre.' 'Who do you think you are?' 'Don't you dare do it again.' And the killer question: 'Why aren't you looking after your sheep?' </p> <p>The paradox of pro-car demonstrators stopping the motorists they claim to represent from using their cars cannot be hidden indefinitely. Last week the Government began its fightback and released hair-raising tales of intimidation of tanker drivers. More telling than the propaganda was a short statement from Chris Fox of the Association of Chief Police Officers. The indulgence officers granted hauliers and farmers, which amazed everyone who remembered the miners' strike, would be replaced by 'vigorous' policing, he said. This is a serious threat. As Lord Falconer and other New Labour lawyers have been whispering, Michael Howard and Jack Straw have ensured that the punishments for protest are now very vigorous indeed. </p> <p>It is not technically illegal to demonstrate in Britain. But if the police are out to get you, it can feel that way. Go on to oil refinery land and you can be arrested for aggravated trespass. Stand on the road outside, and charges for obstructing the highway can follow. Retire to the verge and prosecutors can use laws designed to stop misfits hounding celebs and arrest you for stalking. If you join a march of more than 20 people, you are legally obliged to do what the police tell you or face the consequences. If the oil companies get an injunction against you for restraining their trade, officers will act as their agents. The desire to turn protesters into criminals saturates the Home Office's Prevention of Terrorism Bill. Whitehall is modestly proposing that anyone who damages property, or merely discusses a plan to damage property, should be treated as a terrorist on a par with the Omagh bombers. </p> <p>These are the formal laws against robust dissent. An imaginative constabulary can deploy many others. Two weeks ago a man demonstrating against the digging of a quarry near the Neolithic Nine Ladies stone circle in Derbyshire sat on a dry-stone wall. It collapsed. Helpful officers ran over to check he was all right and then arrested him for criminal damage. </p> <p>The most powerful doctrine of our time is that nation states are powerless in the global market place. It ignores the efforts of one powerful nation state - America - to override all resistance to free trade and deregulated markets and misses the dependence of corporations on compliant politicians. National leaders can still make life uncomfortable for executives in their borders. The rumour going around Whitehall is that Blair has warned the oil companies that he will hit them with a long and burdensome inquiry into their anti-competitive practices if they don't try a little harder to get the petrol tankers moving next time. </p> <p>I can't see the future and don't know if the bickering petrol protesters will give us a next time. If they do, they may learn what trade unionists and greens have known for years. The ancient rights of the British to protest are as much a part of a flattering national myth as the notion that mobs only bring down Ministries in a sinister place called Abroad. </p> <p>Like the Child Support Agency before it, the National Criminal Records Agency is plodding towards its opening ceremony without anyone but a few nervous civil servants being troubled by visions of a bureaucratic hell. </p> <p>Its founding idea appeared as sensible as requiring feckless fathers to pay for the upkeep of their children. The Government would allow the police to disclose the criminal records of job applicants looking to work with children to employers. Paedophiles would be uncovered and everyone else would feel a great deal safer. </p> <p>Repressiveness has its own momentum, however. A justifiable invasion of privacy for the few looks like becoming a trap for the many. Ministers liked the idea of prying so much they decided everyone's criminal records should be opened. All applicants will have to reveal if their pasts were shady or pure. The new criminal records agency will be vetting 10 million people a year - say highest estimates - when it begins work in the summer. </p> <p>Snooping will deter the hiring of ex-offenders and leave them with no option but to return to their thieving ways - hardly an intelligent crime-fighting strategy - even if the agency manages to release accurate records efficiently. </p> <p>There are good grounds for wondering if it will manage that basic task. Earlier this year I wrote about a Metropolitan Police report on the reliability of criminal records, which Scotland Yard was anxious suppress. Officers examined a random selection, it said, and found an 'overall error rate of 86 per cent'. Eighty-five per cent of the these were 'major errors, i.e. those that could potentially lead to... the possibility of financial compensation awards to those affected'. </p> <p>Even if the figures are a freak and other police forces record keeping is far better than the Met's, hundreds of thousands of people will be denied work because of fictitious crimes on their files. They would then have every reason to sue the Home Office. As would employers if they were not warned about the previous of convicted frauds before entrusting them with money. </p> <p>Because this is New Labour, only a private company is deemed fit to run the agency. The winner of the contract was Capita plc. What is worrying the Home Office civil servants who watched private contractors freeze the computers of the Passport Office and asylum department is that Capita's own record is worthy of examination. The complaints about Capita's delays in processing housing benefit claims in South London, upheld by the Local Government Ombudsman, stand out starkly. </p> <p>I'm sorry to crystal-ball gaze again, but it is at least possible that employers won't be getting criminal records by return of post. Applicants may well be left in limbo and on the dole waiting for a file that may be libellously inaccurate.</p>",
  "Tony Blair will launch a thinly veiled attack on the green movement this week, accusing activists of sniping at the Government from the sidelines and refusing to take part in a serious debate about improving the environment. <p>In his first speech on the subject for three years, the Prime Minister will attempt to fend off critics who say his silence on the environment shows he does not give it priority. His words will be seen as a direct attack on Jonathon Porritt, who last week attacked the Government for being too obsessed with spin and focus groups. </p> <p>Porritt, who is on the Government's Sustainable Development Commission, said Downing Street was ignoring green issues. In reply to Porritt's comments the Prime Minister's official spokesman said: 'People have to decide for themselves how they make a contribution.' </p> <p>Blair now plans to take the attack to green groups. He will say that, far from being a brake on development, as some argue, the environment should be seen as a business and consumer opportunity. </p> <p>'We can be richer by being greener,' Blair will tell an audience of business and environmental leaders on Tuesday. 'By being greener we can enrich the quality of our lives.' </p> <p>Downing Street officials said that, although pressure groups such as Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth had raised public awareness, it was now time for them to grow up and join the debate. </p> <p>'Protecting the environment is a non-negotiable priority,' Blair will say. He will argue that a false distinction has been built up by the green movement between businesses, consumers and environmentalists. He will also say that global warming is one of the most serious threats the world is facing and that recent floods in Britain and the Alps show that freak weather events are becoming more frequent. </p> <p>He will announce a \u00a3250m boost to environmental projects, including \u00a350m-a-year for three years for a new 'carbon trust' which will look at ways of providing cleaner fuel technology. Another \u00a3100m will be earmarked for looking at new recycling projects, the improvement of green spaces in cities and renewable energy such as wave, solar and wind power. </p> <p>'To suggest that we are not engaged in the process is ridiculous,' said Charles Secrett, the director of Friends of the Earth. 'There are already plenty of ways we influence the debate. </p> <p>'Blair has got a difficult job to do convincing people that he is serious about the environment. Remember, it is his first speech [on the subject] for three-and-a-half years.'</p>",
  "Hurrah, not before time, Tony Blair wants to be taken seriously as a green. On Tuesday, as we report today, the Prime Minister will make what might be the most significant environmental speech of his premiership. He will emphasise the apparently entirely beneficent nature of many green propositions. Businesses that put sustainability first are efficient businesses. Governments that put environmental diplomacy first, as in climate-control talks, forge new and important alliances. And being green does not mean consumers have to stop consuming; they simply spend in a more discerning way. <p>It is certainly a sunny view of the green cause. However, Mr Blair also seems to believe it is good politics. Noisy neighbours and polluted streets are just the local end of a continuum that extends to global warming, he will argue, and once the connection is recognised voters will reward governments prepared to take up green issues. He is backing his hunch with new money; \u00a3150 million for a new trust to promote technologies that reduce carbon emissions along with \u00a350m each for research into renewable energy and waste recycling. </p> <p>We welcome this long overdue conversion. But we hope Mr Blair has not settled on it because he has been wrongly persuaded that environmentalism is only about 'win-win' solutions that involve no hard choices, tough regulation or protests from special interest groups. The green cause is a natural fit for New Labour. But it requires initiatives on transport and the inner city that are expensive and possibly unpopular; it requires facing down business when it argues that environmental taxes will compromise competitiveness. Internationally, it means taking on the Americans, the world's environmental recalcitrants. </p> <p>Being green also means being tough and long-termist. We can only hope Mr Blair means what he says.</p>",
  "Place Vend\u00f4me in the centre of Paris is a vile and soulless octagon, where the French fetish for symmetry and the banal expression of hard wealth come together in an unholy alliance. <p>There's no place here for softening trees or anything that might grow disorderly. The fa\u00e7ade of the Ministry of Justice at number 13 includes a marble metre, installed there in 1795 so the French people could get used to that surpassingly rational unit of measurement. </p> <p>Jewellers and bankers the likes of which you and I will never patronise thrive here, as does the Ritz Hotel. It's from there Di and Dodi set off on their fatal drive three years ago. </p> <p>Most nights, though, a very different social group can be found in this exclusive quarter. Homeless men curl up on the grate of a huge air vent - the down and nearly out surviving on the free hot air of the super rich. There'll be a lot more of them gathering there in the months to come, as the temperatures fall and the homelessness agencies in Paris become overrun. </p> <p>Last week Le Monde reported an alarming rise in the number of homeless people in central Paris. At the start of this month, according to government figures, 3,800 people took advantage of emergency beds - 1,500 more than at this time last year. </p> <p>Much of the rise is due to asylum seekers who are overwhelming the agencies entrusted with finding them accommodation. Between January and the end of September, 29,000 refugees asked for help with accommodation, compared with 31,000 during the whole of 1999. As a result, the Centre for the Welcome of Asylum Seekers has turned to agencies supplying emergency beds to homeless people in Paris for support. But these groups themselves are struggling to keep up. </p> <p>'We've never faced a situation as bad as this,' said Alain Raillard, secretary general of the Emmana's agency, one of six groups that tries to help people sleeping rough in Paris. 'If the winter is hard, we will not be able to respond to homeless people's needs,' said Patrick Herv\u00e9, director general of another organisation, La Mie de Pain. </p> <p>From 1 December, only 300 more emergency beds will be available compared with last year. If the weather gets really cold, there are plans to make hospital beds available to people sleeping rough. </p> <p>What's most striking for me, just arrived from London, is the juxtaposition of monumental Parisian elegance and order alongside this human misery. Paris is a city where the grass is manicured and the pavements hosed down almost lovingly. It's a city that works, and so the fact that it can't cope with its homelessness problem seems more shocking. </p> <p>In London, I'd become desensitised to the clamour of street people. In Paris, for the moment, it's harder to do that. </p> <p>The abject monologues of beggars in M\u00e9tro carriages still make me shudder - these people have to narrate their miseries to win their daily bread? And my romantic illusions of an evening stroll along the Seine have been shattered by finding a makeshift shelter under the Passerelle des Arts bridge. </p> <p>What's also surprising is that so many different nationalities are sleeping rough here. In London you don't see many black people underneath the arches, still less whole families. But here refugees from francophone Africa, Czechs, Poles, Afghans and peoples from the various nations that made up the former Yugoslavia, form little communities around their fires long after the bateaux-mouches have turned off their floating searchlights for the evening. </p> <p>Meanwhile, among the most privileged Parisians there's a new trend - fur is fashionable again. Last week, the French Communist Party headquarters played host to a party for Italian clothes designers Prada, a soir\u00e9e at which fur coats outnumbered historical materialists by at least two to one. </p> <p>Just off Place Vend\u00f4me, Brentana the furrier is doing a brisk trade. There's a particularly fetching chinchilla coat in the window for only \u00a35,800. Perhaps if the heating vents don't prove warming enough this winter, some of the people sleeping rough in the Place Vend\u00f4me might ask if they could borrow it for the night.</p>",
  "<p>Plans by the European Commission to test more than 20,000 chemicals found in household products could cost the UK's chemical industry 'hundreds of millions of pounds'. </p> <p>The director general of the European Environment Directorate, James Currie, will issue a White Paper early next year stating that chemicals in products which hit the shops before 1992 will have to be re-tested. The measure will kickstart Sweden's presidency of the European Union from next January. </p> <p>The EU has not decided how many chemicals should be re-tested. It could be as many as 70,000. </p> <p>The UK chemical industry, which is worth \u00a332 billion, fears that it will not be able to meet stringent timetables the EU is likely to impose. </p> <p>There are serious concerns that all data resulting from the tests will be stored for public consumption which may lead to competitors accessing secret formulas. </p> <p>Products first in line to be tested include household bleach and paint strippers. </p> <p>'There is a real question as to who's going to pay for this,' said Dai Haywood, director of leading private chemical manufacturer Thomas Swan. 'At the moment all the burden seems to be falling on the industry because it's easier to extract costs from us. But this is going to cost hundreds of millions of pounds.' </p> <p>Industry analysts fear this measure could wipe millions off the sector's share price valuations. 'These tests have been factored in to a degree but until we know exactly how wide-ranging they are, it is unclear what impact this measure will have,' said one. </p> <p>Meanwhile, industry chiefs and animal rights groups fear that the tests will lead to the destruction of millions of animals in laboratory experiments. 'A conservative estimate says we're looking at the slaughter of three million animals,' said Wendy Higgins, campaigns director of the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection. 'We're hoping that the EU will accept alternatives to animal testing.' </p> <p>In America, a similar testing scheme initiated by Al Gore provoked the wrath of US animal rights' protestors and forced a partial climb-down. </p> <p>Frantic lobbying of the European Commission by the chemical industry, which is Britain's number one manufacturing exporter, and the Department of the Environment, is under way with the objective of limiting the number of chemicals to be tested.</p>",
  "<p>Welcome to the aftermath of the old economy. In the race between Europe's new 'just-in-time, 24-hours-a-day, seven-days-a-week' super-states, we are in danger of losing our ability to manage the expectations of an increasingly wired society. Technology can help fulfil our ambitions, but it doesn't do much for people who can't afford ambition. </p> <p>A warning comes from the heart of the internet revolution, the US. A Gartner Group report has found that a whole generation of up to 50 million Americans could become 'functionally illiterate' in the future due to a lack of knowledge of, or access to, the internet. </p> <p>Gartner found that just 35 per cent of adults in the lower-socio-economic-status bracket had internet access, compared with 53 per cent in the lower-middle, 79 per cent in the upper-middle, and 83 per cent in the top bracket. </p> <p>The report identified three digital divides: access to the internet; a skills gap between those who know how to benefit from the internet and those who don't; and speed of access to the internet. </p> <p>As the posturing over cheap, unmetered internet access continues, and the availability of broadband (ADSL &amp; cable) increases, a danger exists that this third divide - between those with high-speed access and those without - may leave non-metropolitan areas disadvantaged. </p> <p>In many respects this threat mirrors the socio-economic gaps in PC ownership today and raises the unacceptable prospect of second-class access to the information super-highway. In Brit-ain, where a quarter of homes are believed to have access to the internet, one can sit comfortably inside the well-connected embrace of the M25 and imagine the benefits of the new dot-communism reaching equally in all directions. But look less than a hundred miles into the South East, as far as Margate perhaps, and the gap between new- and old-economy imagination and aspiration starts to resemble a chasm. </p> <p>Where does one draw the line between one industrial era and another? Is the criterion for an advanced information society really as simple as counting the number of electronic messages that pass between individuals and companies? According to the latest government-sponsored survey, 27 per cent of UK businesses are now using the internet. Scotland leads, with 29 per cent of companies trading online. But compare these figures with private-sector research. Although Ministers claim that the UK is on a par with Germany, the US and Sweden, PricewaterhouseCoopers recently announced that Germany was leading Europe in online transactions. </p> <p>Uncomfortable facts of early twenty-first century life are that we live in a time of profound and complex change in a global economy constantly pursuing the highest profits and lowest transaction costs and that the remains of our manufacturing base is increasingly moving overseas. Unskilled Indonesians may pack processors for a few dollars a day, but a skilled European information worker can command more than \u00a350,000 a year. Between these two extremes, and in every industrial society, there are populations who are too poor and unskilled to share in the new affluence; whose opportunities are increasingly restricted by economic and political forces outside their control. </p> <p>Throughout Europe, governments are anticipating a long-term devastation of the retail and public sector workforce caused by 'disintermediation': the elimination of the middleman by the arrival of the 'just-in-time' forces of information and communications technology (ICT). But the forces of progress carry the seeds of their own acute skills crisis. No single nation has a large enough pool of information-literate workers available to sustain the rapid growth in the global networked economy. </p> <p>The Institute of Directors has 50,000 members from across the old and new economy spectrum. For many, commercial ambition is increasingly constrained by the people factor. While optimism remains high, ICT employment costs are spiralling, and in the absence of a silicon-savvy workforce any vision of economic utopia appears increasingly distant. Understandably, Professor Jim Norton, the IoD's director of e-business development, believes human capital is our ultimate resource. 'Bridging the digital divide and enfranchising all of our population in the e-economy must be the Government's top priority,' he says. </p> <p>In the race to wire UK society into the internet, the Government has a vision, a budget and an initiative. The UK Online project, directed by Department for Education and Employment Minister Michael Wills, has set itself the ambitious target of full digital emancipation within five years. A new research centre is to be created to investigate the impact of new technology and will lead the efforts to end the so-called digital divide before it becomes a problem of acute social exclusion. </p> <p>Facing the prospect of a lost generation, how do governments plan to re-engineer the workforce to meet the demands of a global networked economy? </p> <p>Wills sees the UK Online project meeting the challenge, with two core priorities. 'First, the internet revolution isn't happening for everyone. Every person has the right to access and participate in these technologies. Second, we need to make sure that we have the right skills base. Alongside this comes another range of priorities; the right use of ICT in schools and communities. In the medium to long term, we have to close the skills gap in society. In the short term, and like every OECD country, we have a shortage of people with the right skills, and we have to tackle this head on and in a variety of ways.' </p> <p>In Wills' opinion: the principal challenges that governments need to address urgently are hardware, software and connectivity. 'The danger of a \"third-divide\" appearing is enormously important, which is why we are encouraging the widest kind of competition from telecommunications carriers. While we have a quite well developed cable industry, government needs to immediately target the danger of rural deprivation, and we wish to find innovative ways of reaching disadvantage and deprivation. The truth is that in 20 years we will have got there - but we have to get there quicker than that.' </p> <p>While nobody would doubt that the Prime Minister's own commitmentto rapid action, investment and education are a vital first step in devising a strategy to address a growing skills deficit, there is a harsher macro-economic big picture to consider. Do we in Europe have, like the Americans, a lost generation of our own, a thirtysomething workforce intel lectually and emotionally unprepared for the changes and challenges ahead? </p> <p>The new 'knowledge economy' will be a harsh environment for the common man. While a universal grasp of and access to ICT will emancipate more people in the device space of the web, one must question whether UK Online can deliver a central part of its vision in time. Can it swiftly produce the army of skilled and educated experts required to run tomorrow's new economy today?</p>",
  "<p>For a man who has seen his company's value slide by nearly $40 billion in six months, Tim Koogle is looking remarkably calm. In fact, he looks more than calm. The Yahoo! president and chief executive officer seems positively joyous. </p> <p>Sitting in the study of the Dean's house at the London Business School, just before he addresses some future masters of the universe, Koogle shows no outward sign that he is a man who believes Silicon Valley will soon be renamed Death Valley due to the recent bloodbath in the dotcom sector. </p> <p>Perhaps it is because Koogle believes he is blessed with what he calls the gift of 'serendipity'. 'I've been making money since I was very young. As I look back over four decades of making money the huge value for me in doing that from such an early age is that it has put me in the shoes of my customers and I've got enough perspective to have a pretty accurate view of real consumers. I find a lot of joy in serving up great product and the one thing that drives people's consumption patterns is serendipity.' And serendipity is? The faculty of making fortunate discoveries by accident. Hmm. </p> <p>Before the age of 10, Koogle was a precocious travelling salesman, knocking on his neighbours' doors offering gardening services. As a teenager he worked for one R McDonald, making sure that burger equipment in one of the grinning clown's franchises worked properly. By his forties he had become president of Intermec Corp, a Seattle-based data collection firm. Before that there was a nine-year spell with Motorola in a number of executive positions. </p> <p>Koogle's talk of serendipity might make some of the older heads at the London Business School a little bemused. It conjures up pictures of shareholders looking nervously at each other and asking: 'So this serendipity thing, where d'ya get it and what's it doing to the bottom line?' The answer is a) you either have it or you don't, and b) a great deal. Yahoo! has grown from a company valued at $4 million in 1995 to one which, before the bubble burst, was worth nearly $70bn. </p> <p>The massive surge in the company's value has been largely predicated on the fact that Yahoo! seems to have found a way of linking the separate worlds of media, e-commerce and services like email to create a virtuous circle for the new economy. </p> <p>'We've always been very clear and focused. We have always been open, comprehensive aggregators of world- class content and services. We know that consumption patterns get driven by serendipity. People bump into things that they wouldn't have predicted they wanted.' </p> <p>This might seem a nebulous concept to follow, but Koogle is convinced the approach will work. He argues that the old media distribution methods - such as cable or radio - are no longer where real value lies. </p> <p>'On the internet, no one company controls physical distribution. Anyone with access to internet can access any site - independent of their or its location. So on a slightly philosophical level, the distribution asset begins to be the relationship that is formed between a service and its end users.' And that's where Yahoo! comes in. </p> <p>Koogle, funny and warm with more than a hint of West Coast philosophy professor about him, says this was always the company's intention. 'Even back as early as 1995 we had a vision that we wanted to create a global branded network. It's not just navigation - we're more than a portal. We have many, many services and hosted content throughout the network. We're integrating deeper and deeper within content, commerce, delivery and services across our network. In a very straightforward way, we are a distribution platform for many great providers.' </p> <p>But the danger is that distribution is not where the real value lies - instead, it belongs to the content providers, those firms who in the future will produce the media we will all want to consume. </p> <p>Certainly AOL, in the middle of trying to merge with media giant Time Warner, believes this to be the case. And, in addition to the AOL deal, search engine Excite was taken over by cable operator At Home, while Lycos has married Latin lover Terra Networks, of which Spanish telecoms and media company Telef\u00f3nica is the majority owner. </p> <p>So would Koogle consider a similar sort of deal? 'Not at this time. We of course have considered it. We've had lots of discussions with lots of companies worldwide, some of which are quite large franchises in traditional media. We're very respectful of Time Warner and AOL. We think they're great businesses and great competitors. There's no doubt if they get their merger completed they'll have some kind of financial clout and flexibility but we're believers in the open model. Great content always seeks out great distribution in the history of media. There's great business to be had without owning each other.' However, it is clear Koogle is looking at forging numerous content alliances. 'There are interesting specialised content partnerships that we will be continuing to build and evolve. I think in those kinds of cases there are great content suppliers that see huge value in our distribution, but I don't think we need to own each other. Our goal of being very large and maintaining our size in terms of audience breadth is better-served by being independent.' </p> <p>A merger with a big old media company would go against everything Yahoo! stands for. Set up by two twentysomething Stanford graduates, Jerry Young and David Filo, in 1994, Yahoo! still retains something of a campus mentality. Koogle, who was headhunted the following year, is known to all as TK. Ties are, of course, effectively banned. Hawaiian shirts, of which Koogle owns a particularly ferocious collection, are de rigeur . </p> <p>'We have this really free approach to Yahoo! We all share that same philosophy. You can deliver real joy to customers worldwide if you give them the ability to discover things they otherwise would not have predicted. That's about serendipity itself.' </p> <p>There he goes using that 's' word again. But Wall Street seems less sure about its long- term viability these days. The company is now worth a notch above $30bn. Admittedly this still values Yahoo! at a vertiginous 150 times earnings, but Koogle says the company is now undervalued because analysts are looking too short- term. 'The way we run the business is for the long term. We've built it on great fundamentals. There have been very few companies that have grown to this scale and profitability so quickly.' </p> <p>Hang on. Did he say profitability? The 'p' word is not usually found in the same sentence as the words 'internet company', but Yahoo! is something of an exception. Analysts are pencilling in profits of nearly $280m for the year. Earlier this month the company beat all forecasts to ratchet up third-quarter sales of nearly $300m. </p> <p>Unfortunately, it also had to confess to the fact that it had lost more than 200 online advertisers over the period - a huge worry for analysts, who fear that the company's business model, which depends partly on advertising revenues, could be in jeopardy. Koogle points out that Yahoo! is becoming less and less reliant on dotcom firms for advertising revenue. </p> <p>He says he saw the shakeout coming although he did not think it would be so dramatic. 'I knew we were going to have a correction. It was difficult to predict when. There were valuations that had gotten a little bit out of the range of normalcy. And everyone knew that. I've been a little bit surprised by the speed.' </p> <p>But Koogle argues that the correction now means Yahoo! is in a strong position. 'The concept is to find strategic ways that we can extend our business through acqui sition. The opportunities for us are broader right now because the capital markets are less friendly to early-stage companies.' </p> <p>Serendipity strikes again. </p> <p><strong>Profile</strong></p> <p><strong> Subject: </strong> Tim Koogle </p> <p><strong> Age: </strong> 49 </p> <p><strong> Job: </strong> President and chief executive </p> <p><strong> Other directorships: </strong> Non-executive of Web Van and E-Loan </p> <p><strong> Hobbies: </strong> Guitars, cars</p>",
  "<p>Amid the pouting models, bright lights and sports cars at the Motor Show last week lurked three potent symbols of the deep crisis still gripping the heart of Rover - despite its British rescue earlier this year. </p> <p>The first was a glaring absence - that of Rover itself. </p> <p>The company, recently renamed MG Rover, had decided not to appear at the show despite its location on the manufacturer's doorstep in Birmingham. </p> <p>It had no new models to show and said it did not want to spend the \u00a31 million it typically costs to hire a stand. </p> <p>But a senior executive of a rival carmaker said MG Rover had made a mistake. 'The show will have about 800,000 visitors and probably about a tenth of those will come to our stand wanting to sit in the cars, grab brochures or arrange a test drive. Our exhibit probably cost about \u00a3500,000, and we reckon we will make 500 extra sales as a result and maybe twice that - a minimum of \u00a35m - in additional revenue.' </p> <p>The second symbol was less obvious, but no less ominous - the new Honda Civic. It has been completely redesigned as a hi-tech hatchback with svelte styling and will soon roll out of the Japanese manufacturer's plant in Swindon for sale in Britain in January. </p> <p>This is bad news for Rover because its medium-sized 45 car is based on the current - soon to be the 'old' - Civic, with basic chassis design dating back to when MG Rover and Honda were partners, before BMW bought the British company in 1994. </p> <p>Once the current Civic ceases production at the end of this month it effectively becomes yesterday's car. But MG Rover will carry on turning out the dated 45 as new until it finds the money or the partner to launch a replacement in two or three years' time. </p> <p>The 45 has had a facelift since it was called the Rover 400, but under the groovy new exterior and comfy seats, savvy motorists know its basic engineering goes back a decade. The 25 and MGF convertible are also ageing, along with their engines, and only the 75 executive saloon developed under BMW's ownership is all new. </p> <p>MG Rover chairman John Towers has confidently promised to launch exciting new MG models next year and find a partner to help create a new medium-sized car. He aims to keep Rover in the mainstream, producing 200,000 vehicles a year and competing in the cutthroat middle market with the likes of Ford, Vauxhall, Peugeot, Toyota, Fiat and Renault. </p> <p>But many industry observers are deeply worried that the plan is simply not viable against the giants. The buying public are turning away from MG Rover in their droves as the models fail to appeal. The price war now engulfing the forecourts is likely to damage MG Rover's revenues without sufficiently boosting its market share, which slumped to 3.5 per cent in Britain last month, compared with 12 per cent three years ago, and is only 1.4 per cent in western Europe - less than Skoda. </p> <p>Towers headed the Phoenix British business consortium that took Rover off BMW's hands last spring for \u00a310 after the German carmaker decided to kill off its so-called 'English Patient'. Phoenix stepped in when collapse seemed likely - after UK venture capital outfit Alchemy walked away from a deal to acquire Rover and shrink it to a specialist building 50,000 MG sports cars a year. </p> <p>With a debt-free dowry from BMW of several hundred thousand unsold cars, the Longbridge factory (with its now slimmed-down workforce of 5,500) and \u00a3500m in cash, Phoenix had saved Rover and was the toast of British industry and a relieved UK Government. </p> <p>Towers has since formed a company called Techtronic 2000 to hold the company's shares. He plans to hand 35 per cent of the equity over to the workforce and, as The Observer revealed, is talking to Malaysian carmaker Proton - which owns Lotus - about possible collaboration on a future car, having had partnership approaches to all the volume carmakers rebuffed. </p> <p>Many observers fear MG Rover will be unable to conclude a partnership deal, invest the required billions in new models or increase sales and revenues sufficiently before the cash runs out and time is up. </p> <p>One told The Observer: 'I cannot see how the business is sustainable; there is no clarity of strategic direction. I worry that the Towers plan is just delaying the inevitable and they are looking at a lingering death.' </p> <p>The importance of a strong partner was graphically illustrated by the third symbol of MG Rover's predicament at Birmingham last week - the new Ford Mondeo. The car cost Ford up to \u00a32 billion to develop but the company boasts that when it goes on sale in November, at prices from \u00a314,595, it will cost up to \u00a31,400 less than the current Mondeo and in addition will have about \u00a3800-worth of extra features as standard. </p> <p>There will be 51 different variations of the Mondeo produced from one basic 'platform' but all will have ABS braking, six airbags, electric windows, air conditioning and a CD player as standard. </p> <p>Nick Scheele, chairman of Ford of Europe, said: 'Car buyers want more space, better fuel economy, better safety, more features and lower prices. How do you do that? You take cost out, you talk to suppliers and you put in mega investment, with production and engineering research carried out on a global scale.' </p> <p>Ford makes 8 million cars a year, but even it is losing money in Europe and admits that it has been 'too slow' to replace its Fiesta. How can MG Rover possibly stand up to this kind of economic reality? </p> <p>Ford bought Land-Rover from BMW in the spring and now owns three of Britain's proudest car marques, alongside Aston Martin and Jaguar. Last year it bought Swedish stalwart Volvo, which has plans to increase annual production from 400,000 to 600,000 cars. Ford is busy working out how to share costs between this clutch of businesses. </p> <p>Jaguar is on track to more than double its size and become a 200,000-a-year carmaker when it starts producing the so-called X400 'Baby Jag' at Ford's Halewood factory next year. </p> <p>Managing director Jonathan Browning said last week: 'Could we survive alone? Jaguar's history gives you the answer. It was a private British company in the Eighties and was not able to cope with the pressure of global competition and economic conditions. Then Ford bought it. Nothing has changed fundamentally since then that says we are now any more capable of independence.' </p> <p>In global terms BMW is still a relatively small producer at 800,000 cars, but is fighting vigorously to remain independent and is so far succeeding on the basis of charging premium prices for desirable products. </p> <p>Meanwhile Nick Reilly, chief executive of Vauxhall, said: 'In volume manufacturing you have to have a car platform of 350,000 and really more like 500,000 to 800,000. That is what the competition is going to have, with modern technology at an affordable price. That is the formula.' </p> <p>Developing new cars is so expensive that Vauxhall's parent, General Motors, has bought a stake of 20 per cent in Italian carmaker Fiat: they will share the basic engineering design on future models, building 5 million cars from just two basic platforms. </p> <p>Daimler-Benz has merged with Chrysler and taken Mitsubishi as a Japanese partner; Renault has a controlling stake in Nissan. All are striving for global reach and economies of scale. </p> <p>Without a strong partnership of this kind, most industry and City observers give MG Rover no more than a year to live. If it collapses it will once again send convulsions through British industry - and through Government. But the rest of the world's carmakers and the majority of motorists will barely even notice. </p> <p><strong>Top 10 world car makers</strong></p> <p>1999 world production (millions) </p> <p><strong> 1.

  "<p>The way we look and dress has a vital role to play in self-image and self-worth. It can therefore make demands on our finances out of all proportion to practical considerations. But while we may follow fashion we are not necessarily slaves to it. </p> <p>Between 1989 and 1999 the amount we spent on clothes, footwear and accessories grew by 38 per cent to just under \u00a336 billion. Over the same period, the proportion of money spent on essential items fell. But the high street has undergone a revolution which makes dressing up with the Joneses more affordable. Outlets such as TK Maxx, part of the world's largest 'off-price' clothing retailer, the TJX Companies, and UK operation Matalan have boomed on the back of offering affordable chic. 'The chain stores copy the catwalk al-most instantly these days,' said the V&amp;A's Bolton. 'People are getting much smart-er about mixing these items with one or two designer labels to achieve the right look.' </p> <p>Even celebrities such as Zo\u00eb Ball and Posh Spice can be found flicking through the rails on the high street looking for fashions that can be worn today and then thrown away tomorrow. But this brings with it another set of problems. If fashionable clothes can be purchased for less money, there's nothing to stop us revamping our wardrobes more frequently. The benefits of lower prices are wiped out by more capricious spending. </p> <p>And real financial problems can arise if we work, or spend our leisure time, in an environment where the dress code exceeds our purchasing power. 'The women in the office are all single and wear Prada,' said Sue (not her real name), who works as an office administrator in an advertising agency. 'I'm a single mother and just can't afford to keep up.' And while the high street is becoming more adept at imitating couture style, we are all becoming more brand aware. </p> <p>'Peer group identity is being eroded by brands,' said Bolton. This shift is being recognised by the high street, and retailers such as Debenhams are bringing in high-profile designers to produce special ranges aimed at aspirational Middle England. We don't mend clothes because we get rid of them before we wear them out. </p> <p>Neither is this a purely female thing. Men, particularly younger men, are just as fashion conscious. (Expenditure on male toiletries has risen 79 per cent in the past 10 years.) </p> <p>Brands are also a way of establishing status. In a society where the outward trappings of class are being eroded, brands are one way of identifying with, and being identified by, a social or economic peer group. If Mrs Jones wears Prada, then so do I.</p>",
  "<p>We live in a material world where affluence is demonstrated by conspicuous consumption. If you've got it - the saying goes - flaunt it. But while a spending spree, a high fashion wardrobe, or even the latest must-have in garden design can be fun, the downside is the disconcerting feeling that we are all on some form of money merry-go-round. </p> <p>This spending spree is influenced by economic ups and downs at a personal, national and even global level, but the consumer society itself is here to stay. The more we earn, the more we spend and the more we aspire to spend as we flick through glossy magazines and view the lives of the rich and ostentatious through the television screen. There has always been a human desire to keep up with the Joneses, but now we know about and want to keep up with the Beckhams, the Tarrants and the Blairs. </p> <p>Our ancient ancestors may have painted a particular pattern in woad on their faces to reinforce tribal links. We still want to belong but we do it with cars, kitchens and credit cards. And keeping up with the Joneses has never been so much fun. According to economic psychologist Professor Paul Webley of Exeter University we shop for pleasure - as opposed to need - because we can afford to do so. Although the divide between rich and poor is growing, middle-income families are increasingly well off. According to the British Lifestyles 2000 survey from Mintel, in the past 10 years gross income has increased by 22 per cent in real terms. And while most of us are not addicted consumers, as such, research indicates that there is a work-spend cycle in operation. </p> <p>'People work more, because their employers demand that they do, and so they earn more, spend more, and luxuries become necessities. People work more to earn more and so on,' said Webley. According to Peter Ayton, chief statistician at Mintel, an example of a luxury that has become a necessity for many people is the dishwasher. And as the prices of such domestic appliances have not risen in real terms, they have become more affordable. </p> <p>But this affordability also carries a sting in the tail. The appliance may be more affordable, but service costs have continued to rise, largely due to the fact that labour costs, which are a big part of service pricing, have increased. Once we buy something like a dishwasher we have to look after it; we may have to insure it (as part of our house contents, or with a product warranty), further driving up our spending. Failing that, the cost of major repairs, when they come, may seem relatively high compared with simply dumping the old dishwasher and buying a new one. </p> <p>At the same time we are being subjected to increasingly sophisticated marketing techniques as manufacturers and retailers compete for our custom. Not only do we choose a dishwasher on the basis of cost and efficiency, but also upon whether it will match our new kitchen decor. And if we change the decor, which we do with increasing frequency, the dishwasher may have to go, along with the fridge, the freezer and washing machine. Our home and garden have become colour co-ordinated accessories for our lifestyles. </p> <p>'It's almost as if we need the appropriate interior backdrop to go with the clothes we are wearing,' observed Andrew Bolton, a V&amp;A and London College of Fashion research fellow. This need to spend money on our homes, as well as ourselves, is further reinforced by garden and home makeover programmes on television and a plethora of books and magazine titles. They not only give us fashion trends and decors to aspire to but, in theory, empower us to achieve them. </p> <p>DIY has become the ultimate instant fix; a new look for the front room in the space of a weekend. All it takes is some money and a trip to B&amp;Q. When Mintel questioned 1,958 adults about their spending plans, 38 per cent said decorating and making minor home improvements were a priority. Some 37 per cent listed buying something for the home. </p> <p>So what we are being presented with is not only an increasing desire to spend, but also an ever-greater array of items to spend our money on. It seems that everything in our lives is being influenced by fashion, or the pace of technological change. It would never be possible to have everything we want because what we want changes as fashions change. The key to it all is a sense of proportion.</p> <p><strong>I want it, I want it, I want it. Fiftysomethings are among the biggest spenders </strong></p> <p>It's hardly surprising that after the rigours of war and rationing, people decided to have fun. The 1950s and 1960s saw an increasing emphasis on home decoration and fashion, as well as the birth of the teenager. They had the financial trappings of an adult but few of the responsibilities. Instead, their money went on looking good, entertainment and music. </p> <p>When this generation finally settled down they did so without relinquishing everything that went with being young, free and single. Interestingly, today's 50-year-olds, who were in their late teens as the 1960s drew to a close, are among the biggest spenders.</p> <p>'They are at the peak of their earning power and have grown up since the war in the consumer society,' explains Peter Ayton of Mintel.</p> <p>But they also shop for bargains, look for discounts and stand up for their rights. 'If you look at the consumer programmes on the television they are delivering to this audience,' he added. 'They may be older, but they are also wiser.'</p> <p>So the good news is that we have learnt valuable lessons about saving and spending on the back of property crashes and recessions. But when the good times roll we are bedazzled by an increasing range of things to purchase, housed in ever more attractive shopping environments (where we can eat and relax, as well as buy).</p> <p>One way of getting off the spend-spend-spend merry-go-round is to visit the shops less often. But the latest weapon in the consumer revolution is the internet, bringing an array of potential purchases into our home or on to our television screens, and now we can even buy thousands of things via our mobile phones.</p>",

  "<p>Conspicuous consumption has a conspicuous impact on the environment. The more we buy, the more we throw away and the UK has a long way to go when it comes to recycling. In Switzerland, national household waste recycling runs at about 52 per cent, and in the US it's 31 per cent. Compare that with 9 per cent in England and Wales and less than 6 per cent in Scotland. Packaging is typically 25-30 per cent by weight of dustbin waste. </p> <p>Packaging plays an intrinsic role in the marketing and branding of the things we buy. Sarah Oppenheimer, waste campaigner with Friends of the Earth, said consumers are keen to avoid packaging, but this is often difficult. 'We would like to see more of the material used standardised and made recyclable,' she said. </p> <p>However, Incpen, the Industry Council for Packaging and the Environment, states that making all packaging recyclable would be environmentally unsound. Factory refillable bottles would have to be thicker and heavier, thus taking more fuel to transport. </p> <p>The council admits that some goods, such as luxury chocolates and perfume, are overpackaged, but says that packaging is an 'integral part of the treat'. The perception that goods are overpackaged also reflects a 'lack of understanding of the role of the pack'. </p> <p>Another item that has a profound effect on the environment is the car. According to Tony Bosworth, transport campaigner with Friends of the Earth, air pollution contributes to 24,000 premature deaths in the UK each year. </p> <p>Cars have an impact on climate and the countryside, but while there is a growing awareness of this, cars are still perceived as both a necessity and a status symbol. The good news is that car manufacturers, spurred on by European demands for greater fuel economy and cleaner emissions, have designed smaller models to fulfil status as well as practical requirements. 'Sales of cars in the mini and super mini category increased by 21 per cent and 17 per cent respectively in the first six months of this year,' said Bosworth. 'The sales of luxury saloons were down 9 per cent in the same period.' It isn't all good news. Sales of fuel-heavy multipurpose vehicles and four-wheel drives were up 23 per cent. </p> <p>But Bosworth is optimistic that, as manufacturers continue to put more effort into producing stylish smaller cars, the consumer will increasingly buy a vehicle that is better for the planet, even if their decision is still being influenced by design and luxury interiors. 'I'm happy if they're doing the right thing, even if it is for the wrong reason.'</p> <p><strong>Hijacked by hi-tech </strong></p> <p>Technology left the lab long ago and found its way into the shops. The microprocessor has made hi-tech items smaller, cheaper and more accessible. </p> <p>Companies have increasingly looked for consumer spinoffs from these advances. So technology-enhanced products have become more stylish as the consumer market has become more important. Just as catwalk fashions make it into the high street ever more quickly, so do technological advances, effectively shortening the shelf life of hi-tech products.</p> <p>It is not so much that obsolescence is built in but that obsolescence is a by-product of technological advance. In less than a decade word processors have been overtaken by personal computers, videos by DVDs, cassette tapes by CDs.</p> <p>Telephone answering machines seemed like a luxury in the mid-1980s but now it comes as a shock to telephone a home where your call goes unanswered. It is not uncommon for each member of a family to have a mobile phone and perhaps a pager as well.</p>",
  "<p>Starbucks, the world's largest chain of coffee shops, is looking to perform caff\u00e9 latte society's equivalent of selling coals to Newcastle. The US company, which has 3,600 shops worldwide and boasts 15 million customers a week, is poised to roll out its brand in Italy, home of the espresso. </p> <p>Howard Schultz, the company's founder and chairman, said he had been encouraged by Starbucks' success in the UK, where it has 160 shops and where it plans to open another 140 outlets by 2003. </p> <p>'The level of success we've enjoyed in the UK has given us a level of confidence to proceed to the next market. I believe strongly that we will be successful in the more difficult, sophisticated markets like Italy, but we have to go into those markets with a lot of humility and recognise the success that we've enjoyed to date is not an entitlement,' Schultz told The Observer. </p> <p>'We realised from day one that one of the most challenging and difficult markets was going to be the Continent because of the strong coffee culture and heritage and very good coffee,' Schultz added. </p> <p>Starbucks will open stores in Switzerland in the first quarter of next year and the company is drawing up plans to move into Italy, France and Germany. Although it broke into the UK market in 1998 through the acquisition of the Seattle Coffee Company, which it then re-badged, the plan is to expand on the Continent through organic growth. Starbucks is looking to have a total of 500 stores there within three years. </p> <p>The move represents the latest step in Starbucks' rapid expansion plans. Founded in 1971, the company grew exponentially after Schultz joined the firm in the early 1980s. Starbucks, which had 100 staff in 1987, now employs 50,000 people. </p> <p>The company will sell the same sort of coffee on the Continent as in the US and UK, but it will look to modify its food offerings and store designs. 'We have to be relevant to the local market but I think the core competency - the way we buy and deliver roast coffee - will be pretty consistent,' Schultz said. </p> <p>The company has benefited from a huge upsurge in consumer demand for coffee - the second-largest traded commodity in the world after oil. Schultz said he was confident of expanding market share in the future. 'When you consider that most adults drink at least two cups of coffee every day and, despite our success, we have only around 7 per cent of US consumption, these are early days for us.' </p> <p>But he warned that the battle for market share - at least in the UK - was going to produce some losers soon. 'What we're seeing in the UK is something similar to what we saw in the early Nineties in the US. Back then the market was under-served with quality coffee and quality places to go, and there was a sprint to try to get market share. What happened in the US will probably happen here. Not everyone will make it.' </p> <p>Starbucks' global expansion plans - South America is another priority - will heighten fears of a 'Coca-colonisation' of the globe, but Schultz plays down the concerns. 'We recognise that there are groups and customers out there who are going to want to put Starbucks in this camp of companies who perhaps are part of the globalisation of the world. Our responsibility is to make sure that we're very sensitive to these concerns which are legitimate.' </p> <p>Schultz, who grew up in the Projects - the most deprived area of New York - says Starbucks is committed to helping the wider community through a number of charitable initiatives. He set up the Starbucks Foundation to help improve literacy rates. </p> <p>'Our mission has been to achieve this fragile balance of fiscal responsibility and benevolence. Great businesses and great brands have the ability to accomplish both. We have to continue to demonstrate that there is a heart and a soul to this company.' The Italians, of course, know all about passion.</p>",
  "<p>Acne, scourge of teenagers everywhere, came out of the shadows and into the business spotlight last week. </p> <p>It was Boots the Chemists' biggest acquisition since it disastrously overpaid for Halfords, Payless and Fads 10 years ago. The UK's most powerful pharmacy chain splashed out \u00a3233 million for the Clearasil and Biactol spot remedy brands from US Pringles-to-Pampers giant, Procter &amp; Gamble. </p> <p>For Boots, the deal gives it vital US penetration. Clearasil, invented in the late Forties by American Ivan Combe - the man behind Odor-Eaters and the Grecian men's hair formula - is a market leader in the States. The product will act as a bridgehead for Boots' other big-name, over-the-counter health products, which include Nurofen and Strepsils. It will also bolster its other teenage skincare products. </p> <p>Over the last four years, Boots has bought teenage skincare products in both France and Germany to tap into a worldwide acne consumer market worth \u00a31.5 billion and growing by 5 per cent each year. The prescribed acne-related drug market is worth another \u00a31bn. </p> <p>But more importantly Boots sees this acquisition as a way of enticing more customers on a long-term basis. The theory is that if Boots can be the teenagers' friend in their darkest hour, they will stay with the trusted health care group throughout their lives. </p> <p>Analysts, who have mostly been bearish on Boots as its shares have slid from a high of \u00a310.70 in mid-1998 to \u00a35.40 this weekend, praised the deal, despite the Nottingham-based firm paying a high price for the brand - 2.5 times its annual \u00a394m worldwide sales. </p> <p>'It's a clearly defined strategy,' said one. 'Boots knows its future lies in healthcare and related services. Its pharmacy division is under attack as margins are reduced thanks to the aggressive pricing strategies of Wal-Mart and Tesco. Healthcare is a growing market and it is how it can become a world player and create shareholder value. This deal gives it more than a foothold into global markets. It makes sense.' </p> <p>Barry Clare, Boots Healthcare International's managing director, explained why he thinks acne is a market worth tapping. 'Central heating, less time spent on outdoor activity, less time spent on healthy pursuits and worsening diets are driving up the problem.' </p> <p>Clare, who confirmed that similar consumer healthcare product acquisitions were on the cards, is intent on a massive Clearasil marketing push. The brands, he believes, stagnated under the ownership of Procter &amp; Gamble, which instead concentrated on its Olay beauty products. </p> <p>But in the week in which Body Shop boss Anita Roddick slammed anti-ageing creams as 'pap', there are many who fear that companies such as Boots and SmithKline Beecham, which makes the rival Oxy product, are making unrealistic claims for their brands. </p> <p>'There are no overnight cures for acne,' said Acne Support Group chief executive, Alison Dudley. 'The old Clearasil ads showed the amount of dirt that comes off cotton wool thanks to Clearasil. The inference is that acne is caused by dirt. This is totally inaccurate. You cannot wash away spots. The blame doesn't lie with the products. It lies with the hazy, misleading messages. </p> <p>'Kids are more likely to have less self-worth as increasingly people are aware of beauty and skin care. Airbrushed images in the media tell us we could and should have perfect skin and this is what these products are preying on.' </p> <p>Boots is adamant that it will take a responsible attitude to its advertising. </p> <p>It needs to. 'Pus Daddy' is the latest jibe meted out to those with acne by school kids increasingly obsessed with personal appearance. </p> <p>According to the British Association of Dermatologists, 85 per cent of the population suffer from acne at some point in their youth and 15 per cent have severe problems. </p> <p>The London-based Acne Support Group says that 15 per cent of those questioned in a recent survey felt suicidal as a result of the condition. </p> <p>But those with acne are often too embarrassed to talk to a doctor. And if they do, they are usually fobbed off with a pat 'it'll pass' response. By the age of 25, it usually does. But the disease, for which there are no cures - just treatments - is regarded as trivial. 'The market has been talking down to the customer,' admitted Clare. </p> <p>However, in the reclusive world of spot sufferers there are more pressing fears. Last month the US Food and Drug Administration met to discuss whether to restrict the use of the anti-acne drug Roaccutane, produced by Swiss-firm Roche Products. The drug has been 'associated' with depression and even suicide. </p> <p>America's FDA decided against restricting it, but demanded that Roche compile a register of all those prescribed the drug, which is taken by mouth and can cause birth defects in the offspring of women pregnant while taking the drug. </p> <p>The FDA continues to monitor the situation and a spokeswoman said: 'There's enough evidence to indicate an association [with psychiatric disorders] but not enough to suggest a causal link.' </p> <p>There is no doubt that Roaccutane has changed many acne sufferers' lives for the better. But the drug - a vitamin A derivative known as a retenoid - is facing legal actions worldwide from patients who claim to have suffered severe depression or attempted suicide while on it. Claims are being prepared in Britain and Ireland. The European Union is also 'aware there are problems'. </p> <p>Britain's leading dermatol ogist, Dr Tony Chu, is concerned that the drug, which since 1982 has been administered to about 11 million people worldwide and last year took sales of more than \u00a3300m, is 'over-prescribed'. </p> <p>'My feeling is it's overused. It's like zap therapy but the relapse rate is about 50 percent.' </p> <p>Roche maintains that a suicide rate of 1.7 patients on Roaccutane per 100,000 is 10 times lower than the average suicide rate according to research by the Samaritans. </p> <p>'Psychiatric events reported in association with Roaccutane therapy reflect the multiple risk factors in the population of adolescent and young adults afflicted with the disfiguring disease of acne,' the company said. </p> <p>It added: 'Roche takes issues of safety very seriously and is diligent in monitoring the safety of all its medicines.' </p> <p>But for those who take Roaccutane, the 'associated' psychiatric risks of the drug, which are now spelt out in a special warning when it is prescribed, is all they need. </p> <p><strong>What is acne?</strong></p> <p>ACNE is an inflammatory skin disease. It affects the tiny pores which cover the face, arms, back and chest and the oil glands attached to them. </p> <p>It is caused by an excessive response by grease glands under the skin to sex hormones which partially blocks pores, restricts the flow of oil on to the skin and results in solidification of the oil which causes blackheads. </p> <p>If the blockage becomes complete, oil builds up around the hair. </p> <p>The hair root then becomes infected with the bacteria normally present on skin. This bacteria breaks down the oil to inflammatory chemicals which causes redness and pus - the zit. </p> <p>The disease is normally self-limiting which is why, by the time the sufferer reaches 25, it has normally abated.</p> <p><strong>The skin game</strong> </p> <p>Total UK acne spend: \u00a364m </p> <p><strong>Clean &amp; Clear (J&amp;J) 20% </strong> <br><strong>Oxy (SmithKline Beecham) 19% </strong> <br><strong>Clearasil (Boots) 15% </strong> <br><strong>Biactol (Boots) 7%</strong></p> <p>Source: Information Resources</p>",
  "<p>Alan Titchmarsh is a sex god. Deep breath. Try again. Alan Titchmarsh is a sex god. Titchmarsh. Alan. Sex. God. Is... Nope. It's no good - I still can't make that leap of faith.

Anyway, we have proof that Alan Titchmarsh is an SG because he says so himself and he is a far too nice a man to lie. </p> <p>Just the other day, on Ground Force, he announced, 'I'll have you know I'm the sexiest man on telly after George Clooney.' He didn't actually explain the basis for this statement because he was too busy toshing up a topiary peacock at the time, but I asked him afterwards, and he said it was from some television survey quoted in The Daily Telegraph. Elle magazine put him in a list of top 20 gorgeous hunks and Woman's Own included him in a feature on 'hidden heart-throbs'. Two years ago he was mobbed by women at a Gardeners' World live show in Birmingham - and not all old biddies either. So there you go. Alan Titchmarsh is a sex god. </p> <p>And he has now written not one, not two, but three novels in which quiet manly heroes stroll through life to a chorus of long-limbed lovelies going 'phwoar! Look at that sex god with the secateurs!' The eponymous hero of his first novel, Mr MacGregor, was 'a man whose looks and build would have been perfectly at home modelling rugged outdoor wear in a Racing Green catalogue.' See? Total sex god. The girls in his new novel, Animal Instincts, keep asking each other about the hero - 'Dishy?' 'Unbelievably.' 'Hunky?' 'You bet.' When one of them finally gets him in the hay, she looks at his 'broad chest, strong legs and muscular arms' and whispers, 'You're so beautiful.' </p> <p>I wouldn't actually call Alan Titchmarsh beautiful, but he is catalogue-handsome like his heroes, albeit several inches shorter. And he has proper man-of-the-soil blisters on his hands, which, he says, he acquired yesterday shifting six tonnes of topsoil in a howling gale for Ground Force. He reckons it's Ground Force that has made him a sex god - that and his novels, which show his sensitive side. But it was odd for it to happen so late in life (he is 51) because when he was younger no one fancied him. He thinks perhaps he's got sexier as he's got older, or at least more comfortable in himself. While we were having lunch in a restaurant in Kensington, two fans spotted him through the window and waved at him. One was a little boy - 'You see!' he said, 'even children watch Ground Force !' - the other was a smartly dressed middle-aged woman who kept tapping on the window and blowing kisses till I thought she was demented, but she turned out to be Anne Robinson. </p> <p>I reminded him that we'd met once before at the Literary Review Bad Sex awards, but this was not a very tactful subject to bring up. He won for a passage in Mr MacGregor: 'She planted moist, hot kisses all over his body. Beads of sweat began to appear on Guy's forehead as he became more entangled in the lissom limbs of this human boa constrictor. For fully 15 minutes their mutual passion heightened, with groans, sighs and liquid noises.'</p> <p>Titchmarsh didn't actually win, he reminds me - Sebastian Faulks did for Charlotte Gray - but Faulks chickened out of coming to the prize giving, so Titchmarsh got the prize. But just remembering it makes him tetchy. 'Oh, you grit your teeth and carry on - the one award that comes back to haunt you. It would be easier not to bother writing love scenes at all, just leave them out, stop when the bedroom door closes, but I think that's bottling out, and anyway I quite enjoy reading it. I don't labour it or name the parts but I like showing two people getting on.' </p> <p>And getting into their white fluffy towelling bathrobes, which is always the key moment in any Titchmarsh sex scene. You know it's going to be really steamy when the white bathrobes, white bathsheets and 'crisp' duvets come out - though crispness, come to think of it, is not a particularly desirable quality in a duvet. You'd imagine he'd worked all his life in a bedlinen department rather than a garden. Ah, but that's just it, he explains. 'Because I work in the muck all day, I like to be clean. Nothing grubby for me! Do you know,' he goes on, 'I hadn't realised I'd put a white bathrobe in this novel - isn't that terrible? - it just shows how your subconscious comes out. But doesn't everybody have a white towelling bathrobe?' Not necessarily - they come in all different colours. 'Oh no, it's got to be white. If you see someone wrapped up in a towel, and it's all white and clean and lovely, that's sensuous.' Not black? 'No, that's too kind of 60s isn't it? Black towel, black sheets - that's scary really.' I wondered if he associated white bathrobes with hotel sex, but he said indignantly no, he had a white bathrobe at home. And his wife, Alison? 'Er, she has a pale blue one.' </p> <p>It is time to stop teasing him and admit that I do actually enjoy his novels, in a Jilly Cooperish sort of way. They are always well-plotted, with likeable characters, and they have great descriptions of landscape and nature. In his latest novel, Animal Instincts, the hero buries his father in 'the stony cliff-top loam'. Could Martin Amis give you soil details like that, could Salman Rushdie? And the moral is very sweet - that we must all cultivate our own gardens or our own patch of countryside rather than telling other people what to do. But the book will probably upset some of his fans because it defends foxhunting - Titchmarsh's line is that although he'd never want to chase and kill an animal himself, hunting is a traditional part of country life and therefore should be preserved. </p> <p>Basically, though, all his novels are love stories, and it is rare to find a man writing such unabashedly romantic fiction. He says he didn't set out to do it: 'I just wanted to write stories, but the romantic side of me came to the fore. Without sounding posey, in a way you don't get to choose what you write - it comes out the way it's going to come out.' He knows he writes 'feel-good fiction' but that's fine by him - he never likes angst. 'My novels are meant to be a good romp. I know they're not intellectually challenging or seminal works!' </p> <p>He has already started on his fourth novel, which he says will be about a father-daughter relationship. He writes in the winter, when the television gardening season dies down, in a hut in his garden with 'Barleywood Yacht Club: Members Only' on the door. He is incredibly prolific. Apart from presenting two television series, Ground Force and Gardeners' World, he has written 36 gardening books, and has just signed up to write some more for the BBC, as well as writing three weekly and two monthly gardening columns. He also does occasional after-dinner speaking and personal appearances, though he says he deliberately sets his fee very high so he doesn't get too many of them, otherwise he'd be opening garden centres every weekend. And, of course, he gardens every day for real, not just for television. He says that he could give up television quite easily, but he could never not garden, he needs that daily contact with the soil. </p> <p>Sex god, gardener, novelist, television star. How did Alan Titchmarsh happen? I mean it's not a career he could have planned as a boy in Ilkley, Yorkshire, in the 50s because sex-god gardeners didn't exist. But he was passionate about gardening from a very early age - he built his first polythene greenhouse when he was 12. Was that normal in Ilkley? 'Oh no, it was odd. Boys were meant to kick a ball in the street or play with a cricket bat. But I had a mate in the street who was also keen on gardening, so that was good. And he said that when he grew up he was going to be a postman because you could do all your work in the morning and then garden all afternoon. But I said, \"I'm going to be a gardener because that's all I want to do\" - and I did . But Dad, being a plumber, hated gardening, and he told me why later - because as a child he was made to weed for his father and grandfather [who were both professional gardeners] and it put him off. I had no idea at that stage, but Dad had been the odd one out and I was just carrying on the family tradition.' </p> <p>He was useless at school and felt squashed all the time - he thinks because he was 'too much of an eager puppy'. He was always leaping up saying, 'I can do that' and the teachers were saying, 'Shut up, sit down.' Also, 'I was very small at school, 4ft nothing, and always called Titchymarsh. That was OK, I didn't used to go home and sob, but I didn't enjoy it. And I knew what I wanted to do, I knew where I wanted to go and I just knew I had to do it.' So he left school at 15, with just one O level in art, and went to work for Ilkley Parks Department. He recalls the humiliation of having to water hanging baskets while his former schoolmates walked by, but also the joy of working in the nursery where he was 'blissfully happy, focused'. </p> <p>Then he went to horticultural college and to Kew Gardens, where he did a three-year diploma course, and was then appointed training supervisor. It was a prestigious job, setting up training courses, and he had his own key to the gardens, and a briefcase with E II R embossed in gold. His office was King George III's dining room. But one day he found himself quietly banging his head on the wall because he was so bored. He says it was 'like a Road to Damascus experience' - he knew he was in the wrong job, and he knew he had to get out. </p> <p>Soon afterwards, his boss came in with the Gardener's Chronicle open at the situations-vacant page and said, 'Who do we know who's got a literary bent?' And Titchmarsh said, 'Me.' At that stage, the only evidence for his literary bent was the English O level he'd recently taken at nightclass, but anyway he applied for the job as gardening-books editor for Hamlyns, and got it. And when someone failed to deliver a book on greenhouse gardening, he wrote it himself, and then moved to become deputy editor of Amateur Gardening magazine. Meanwhile, in 1975, he married Alison, a dance and games teacher he met through the Barnes and Richmond amateur operatic society, and had two daughters, Polly and Camilla, now 19 and 17. They lived in a tiny two-up, two-down cottage in Sunningdale and were so hard up they sometimes had to hide on Fridays when the milkman came round for his money. </p> <p>So he was very pleased indeed when, in 1979, television beckoned. There was a sudden plague of greenfly on the south coast and he was sent to Margate to report for Nationwide . 'I suddenly tasted blood. It was God! Wow! Oh my God, I like this. I want to do more.' In fact, he had to wait a year for his next television summons, but soon he was spreading like ground elder, doing gardening spots for Breakfast Time , presenting Songs of Praise and a series called Open Air, and then doing his own chat show on Pebble Mill at One. For 10 years, he was the Wogan of lunchtime television - he interviewed everyone from Placido Domingo to Barry Manilow, from Bette Davis to Julia Roberts (he gave her one of his gardening books) - but I can't find anyone who recalls ever seeing any of his interviews. </p> <p> Was he any good as an interviewer? 'Yes I think I was quite good. I wasn't aggressive but I hope I wasn't bland. My aim during the course of a lunchtime interview was just to make the viewer's fork pause on its way to their lips.' It sounds rather a modest aim. Was he blander than Parky, blander than Wogan? The test would be if he could give a rough ride to, say, Thora Hird? 'Ah, but then the bottom line is, why would you want to? You can ask an aggressive question that makes you look good, but if you don't get an answer then it's a waste of time. And you can tickle trout can't you?' 'Not personally.' 'I mean, you can go down to the stream with a club and blast around in the water, which is the Paxman technique and extremely good for politicians, but I think there are other techniques. You can ease things out of people without being bland.' </p> <p>Hmm. It is often said that Steve Coogan's Alan Partridge was partly based on Titchmarsh, but Titchmarsh insists it couldn't be because 'I never wore pullovers like that.' But he recalls interviewing Steve Coogan several times on Pebble Mill at One before he was well known, so 'Perhaps I am like that really. I suppose he just regards me as a rather middle-of-the-road chat-show host - you're a great Aunt Sally for that kind of thing.' Victor Lewis-Smith once wrote that 'The five most debilitating words in the English language are 'Ladies and gentlemen - Alan Titchmarsh' and Titchmarsh has not forgotten it. 'The first time you get real criticism like that it wounds you for a week and you go around thinking \"This is the end of my career.\" So I wrote off to him, and he wrote me this grovelling apology and I really thought, \"Ugh, what a comeback.\" If you're going to say something like that, for goodness sake have the guts to stand up for it. So after that I just didn't bother.' </p> <p>He doesn't think he failed as an interviewer - after all, the programme ran for 10 years - but on the other hand it didn't lead to anything. Once,Wogan's producer took him out to lunch, but there was no follow-up call. Even now, he admits, 'I watch Michael Parkinson enviously and think I'd like to do that.' But after 10 years of chat-show hosting, it was back to gardening - luckily he'd kept his hand in by writing a gardening column for the Daily Mail - and he took over Gardeners' World when Geoff Hamilton died in 1996. 'So I was back out in the garden, really quite happily, having a breath of air. And then after a year of that, Ground Force came along and it was sort of stratospheric.' </p> <p> Ground Force really is stratospheric in television terms - it regularly attracts 12 million viewers and comes second only to EastEnders in the ratings. It started quietly on BBC2, but then shifted to BBC1 when the nation collectively fell in love with Charlie Dimmock. Titchmarsh once said apropos Dimmock that he sometimes felt like Prince Charles must have felt when the crowds kept asking 'Where's Princess Di?' Very galling, when he was the expert and supposedly the star. Was his nose put out of joint? 'No, you couldn't let it be, and she's such a sweetheart. But, of course, there is that initial reaction of \"Excuse me!\" But then you have to ask yourself, \"Do I want that kind of attention? Do I want to be photographed everywhere I go.\" And the answer is no, actually, because that's not my bag. And you know in the days when I started watching gardening programmes there was only Percy Thrower, and it's good to have a variety of folk pushing what to me is my life's passion.' </p> <p>All my serious gardening friends get very snooty about Ground Force - they loathe the idea that anyone can create a garden in two days, they hate all those 'features' and ready-grown plants. My colleague Monty Don argues that the trouble with any makeover programme is that it 'subverts and by-passes the rhythm of gardening, which is a huge part of the pleasure'. On the other hand, Monty admits that his children love Ground Force - although they hate gardening.</p> <p>Then there is the pebble question. No Ground Force garden is complete without its pebble path or 'feature' and conservationists worry that people go and nick them off the beaches. It would indeed be ironic if Britain is finally flooded, not by global warming, but because all our sea defences have been removed to make pebble features in patios. But I agree with Titchmarsh that if Ground Force inspires even just one per cent of its viewers to take up gardening, it will have added to the sum of human happiness. And there is convincing evidence that it has done that - the national spend on gardening has gone up by a third over the past two years. </p> <p>He believes that the English are still the best domestic gardeners in the world (though the Dutch are better at houseplants, and the French and Italians at formal gardens), but we need to work at keeping the tradition alive. That's why, much as he loves Ground Force , he believes Gardeners' World is more valuable, because it's teaching the old skills - how to dig, how to propagate, how to plant, how to prune - which are in danger of being lost. He will give up Ground Force before he gives up Gardeners' World . In fact, he hints he might give it up quite soon, maybe next year, because 'I really want to clear off while we're still at the top. I love doing it, I love enthusing people, I love showing my passion, but it takes a heck of a lot of energy, and I want to stay fresh doing it, I don't want to go off.' </p> <p>His books, his programmes, his novels have now made him a wealthy man, but he and Alison still live quite modestly. Their only big extravagance was building a 60-seater theatre on their house where they give occasional shows for charity and a Christmas entertainment for the village. They also have a 38ft trawler yacht down at Chichester, which they use to escape at weekends. He recently bought himself a Mazda MX5 'for my midlife crisis' but says his Puritan work ethic would stop him buying a Jaguar. His worst extravagance, he says, is buying old books on topography and he once paid \u00a31,000 for one, but that's as bad as it's ever got. And still his most treasured possession is the budding knife he was given on his first day at work in the Ilkley Parks Department. He still uses it on Gardeners' World . 'They don't make them any more - you can get other budding knives but they're not the same. It's perfectly balanced, it fits the hand well, it still keeps an edge, it's a proper professional budding knife. I remember being given it on my first day and it was pure heaven.' </p> <p>What seems odd to me is that he hasn't bought a bigger house and garden. He calls his home 'Barleywood' on television, but it is actually number 39 Beech Road or some such address, in one of those pseudo-country Hampshire dormitory villages so beloved by Pony Club girls. And although his garden is terribly long and, of course, beautifully tended, it is basically a narrow strip running very steeply uphill behind the house and partly overlooked by neighbours on either side. It has 'features' every few yards - everything from a gypsy caravan to a Japanese water garden - but it lacks the dreamy enclosed tranquillity of a proper English country garden. He says that gardens should reflect their owners' personality, and perhaps his reflects him - it is busy, cheery, extrovert, improved to within an inch of its life, with none of those dark, mouldy Freudian patches where sinister fungi thrive. </p> <p>Shyly, blushingly, like a virgin, I confessed that I have just this past year started gardening, and could he give me any tips? Yes, he said masterfully: well-rotted manure, Felco secateurs, and trust your instincts. He believes that most of us have more gardening nous than we know, 'Because it must be basic to us - it's what we did before we wore clothes, before we did anything else. But a lot of us have lost it over the years and we need to find it again. People are too frightened about planting, frightened they'll do something wrong, but there's a lovely line in Laurie Lee where he says his mother handled plants \"with a sort of slapdash love\" - and I think that's the thing, that sort of casualness, like a woman with 10 babies and she's giving one a bit of bread here and one a cuddle there - you need a feel for them.' And then I asked him what would grow under my oak tree and he wrote down three names - Rubus tricolor, Hypericum calycinum, Hedera hibernica - and I went home happy. What other sex god can give you that?</p>",
  "<p><strong>The 10 O'Clock News </strong>BBC1<br> <strong>One Foot In The Grave </strong>BBC1 <br> <strong>The Royle Family </strong>BBC1 <br> <strong>North Square </strong>C4 <br> <strong>Black Books </strong>C4 <br> <strong>Clarkson </strong>BBC2 <br></p> <p>The week before last, several newspapers ran large photographs taken during rehearsals for the new BBC <strong>10 O'Clock News</strong>. Even to those of us for whom television output is of slightly more than passing interest, news about the News but with no news in it is, quite simply, no news at all. And it's not even the sort of 'no news' that can be interpreted as 'good news', either - it's just nada, zero, zilch news, whatever time it's on and however big the picture in the Guardian. </p> <p>Sorry, but I just can't get excited about numbers without a few noughts at the end. Indeed, the breaking story about the new-look News so completely failed to excite me into a state of indignation that I don't even remember whether it starred Michael Buerk or Peter Sissons in front of the logo with - gasp! - a big 10 on it, instead of - au revoir, farewell, adieu! - a nine. But I misread the mood of the nation and for that matter mine too: </p> <p>'Look at this! This doesn't work at all !' I found myself shouting, incandescent with Petit Chablis, transforming into the Victoria Meldrew of Maida Vale in the time it took to flick through all the terrestrial channels last Thursday night. 'You can't have Question Time right after the News and then turn over to BBC2 and find Newsnight 's on as well...' For close attention to the schedules had indeed revealed a mega-news tsunami: 10 pm, BBC1: The News, followed by regional news, followed by Question Time ; 10.30, BBC2: Newsnight; 11pm, ITV, News, followed at 11.20 by regional news; 11.30, Channel 4, the inaccurately-titled and not-funny-any-more would-be satirically news-orientated, The 11'OClock Show. And, on Channel 5, something called G-String Divas. </p> <p>So I take it all back. And, apparently, some other people not employed by the news media also care passionately about the timing of the BBC news. Farmers, in particular, are furious because, alongside the parents of small children, stressed executives, pensioners, shift workers and an infinite assortment of other habitual news-watchers, it's often lights out by 10. And though, on Monday night, Victor Meldrew and The Royle Family were the first benificiaries of the new BBC1 evening schedules, I don't think they would approve either. In fact, they'd probably agree with Jim Royle's preferred critical adjective - that it was 'shite'. </p> <p>The return of <strong>One Foot In The Grave</strong> to our screens was marked by the arrival of a giant television in Victor's bedroom, because, as Mrs Meldrew explained: 'Fifteen-inch and 50-inch sound very similar over the phone.' A 15-inch Lorraine Kelly discussing 'clenched colons' over breakfast would have been bad enough, but 50 inches-worth blew the subject out of all proportion. As Jim Royle observed 30 minutes later, there's an awful lot of 'shite' on terrestrial TV - and nowhere this week was there more shite than in the 60 minutes leading up to the debut of the 10 O'Clock News. In One Foot In The Grave, aside from Lorraine's irritable bowel syndrome and a fragrant scene set inside the lavatory of a Chinese restaurant, Meldrew also presented Angus Deayton's Patrick with some 'art' made from birdshite - Chris Ofili meets Jackson Pollock, via 'the rectum of a very nervous albatross'. While, later, in <strong>The Royle Family</strong>, baby David Keanu was breastfed, reluctantly, by Denise, much to Jim Royle's horror. </p> <p>'Da-ad! It's only natural!' </p> <p>'So's doing a crap, but you wouldn't do that in the lounge, would you?' Soon enough, however, baby David was having his nappy changed, by his father, Dave, on the coffee table, in front of Ready Steady Cook. 'When are you going to start changing a nappy, Denise?' asked Jim of his daughter. </p> <p>'No way. It smells of shite.' </p> <p>Later, during a predictably pointless discussion about baby David's dad's birthweight, Jim observed that he 'couldn't give two shiny shites about what weight Dave was as a baby!', thus speaking for all of us. Later still, contemplating the possibility of his son, Anthony, being homosexual, Jim was driven to observe that 'Elton John was married to a woman but he still drops anchor in poo bay!' </p> <p>The received critical wisdom is that The Royle Family, winner of shiteloads of plaudits and awards, is a creation of contemporary comic genius but, aside from last year's gently bathetic Christmas special, I have always found it depressing. At least when Meldrew rages, his rage is a recognisable by-product of a morally and ethically complex personality, albeit one whose interior tectonic plates have shifted permanently out of kilter with those of his peers, but the humour within The Royle Family comes from celebrating lives without any shred of moral conviction about anything at all. Thus, as an exercise in comic futility, however well-acted (and it is faultlessly performed), it can never amount to an emotional experience greater than the sum of its biological parts. Perhaps there's just a very thin line separating comedy 'shite!' from the old-fashioned sort of shite, but whenever I watch the Royles, I invariably feel like signing up for VSO or becoming a Samaritan or something, though usually I settle for a long, hot, heavily-scented bath. </p> <p>So it was a very anally-attentive sort of week. Shite, everywhere, with excrementally-driven plot developments in unexpected quarters. Perhaps comedy writers need to book in for a collective colonic. Channel 4's <strong>North Square</strong> is the latest TV Chambers of Horrors: the new 'not This Life', replete with youthful thrusting lawyers, thrusting youthfully. It has jaw-judderingly staccato dialogue (one little monologue by a female solicitor called Stevie was completely impenetrable), wobbly cameras, a trying-too-hard soundtrack (the Clash, Air) and several of those square-jawed pretty-boy characters who all look so similiar that it takes until at least the second commercial break before you can quite remember which is which, and why you ought to care. </p> <p>Though not a comedy, North Square had a shite scene, too, in which Ruth Millar, as the Chambers' new, sweetly naive legal pupil, Morag from Mull, sat on a lavatory, (white) knickers at half mast, before making her first court appearance to defend a murderer. The scene was one part McBeal to two parts Meldrew, though McBeal's lawyers tend to prefer using their lavatories for gossip or sex in order to create a comedy stink. Anyway, there was no paper in Morag's loo, so she used her scarf. It was a horrible scarf. </p> <p>Meanwhile, after last week's subtle declaration of affection (via his character, Bernard Black, reading a copy of The Observer), the fact that my secret, merely technically unrequited lover-cum-soulmate, Dylan Moran (proprietor of Channel 4's <strong>Black Books</strong>), failed to send me a coded message this week was, I think it's safe to assume, a coded message in itself because, Dylan, even your silence speaks volumes . While last Friday's plot, in which Bernard went to a dinner party and disgraced himself by defecating in the host's wicker chair (he probably even left the cushion up afterwards) reassured me that, though the screen has been smeared with distracting amounts of televisual shite all week, some of it smells so much sweeter than the rest. </p> <p>Take, for example, Jeremy Clarkson (you might have missed the return of his chat show, <strong>Clarkson</strong>, on Thursday, while caught in the news-scheduling maelstrom), whose ignorance about (and sneering lack of interest in) global warming were dismissed, decisively and hilariously, as so much gaseous greenhouse fodder by guest Jonathon Porritt. 'You was whupped!' said his next guest, Martin Clunes, gleefully - and though, like Clunes, Clarkson has just turned 40, only one of them still boasts a toddler's aptitude for talking shite.</p>",
  "This we know: we're stressed-out, debt-ridden, exhausted. We have less time for our families than we feel we should have. We take fewer pleasures from our entertainments and consumptions than we expected to take. We feel less connected to our communities than we ever did. In our workplaces, we subject ourselves to routines and duties which at best seem pointless, at worst unethical or immoral. Yet we also feel like hollow citizens, too weary to respond to any political entreaty with anything other than a shrug. In short, we are workers. <p>Yet why do we meekly accept this condition, when our brave new technological future - the amazing potential still to be unleashed in computers, genetics and molecular engineering - could change it utterly? Why, with all this power at our disposal, do we still feel like mere objects ourselves? </p> <p>But this is how the work ethic continues to grip us. It doesn't matter how many machines could do our more tedious mental and physical labours. Forget the promise of the future, or even the possibilities of the present. Too many of us still regard turning up for work, however dispiriting or futile, as the very mark of inclusion and legitimacy, the measure of our moral fibre. 'I put in the hours, therefore I am.' </p> <p>Anything beyond the steely certainties of the work ethic seem either frightening or flaky: the oblivion of no job, the insecurity of self-employment, the turpitude of domesticity. So the treadmill is wearily mounted, once again - in absence of any alternative vision. Yet why believe in work, when work doesn't believe in you? </p> <p>The constant watchwords of the new capitalism are flexibility, creativity, self-improvement. Workers are urged to 'get up to speed' with a runaway world: we must become mobile and tensile, enterprising and capable. Yet these injunctions come from companies which hire you for a year, six months, maybe even less; which might be taken over at any time; which try to wriggle out of long-term entanglements such as pensions, wage and holiday agreements; and which shed labour whenever there's a dip in the markets. Trying to excel for companies that are themselves transient, provisional and unforgiving will one day seem like the grandest folly. </p> <p>When that realisation comes - that is, when the work ethic crumbles - then an intellectual vacuum will open up at the heart of contemporary capitalism, and we'll need a Big Idea. Over the last decade, we've already seen a procession of not-big-enough ideas - 'downshifting', 'work-life balance', all those slackers and idlers. None of them with much success or distinction. </p> <p>They all try to speak to our deep common anxiety: that if we keep up our loyalty to the work ethic, in a world where competition, mutability and innovation rule supreme, we will destroy ourselves. </p> <p>The LSE's Richard Sennett calls this the 'corrosion of our characters' - where the acids of the new capitalism eat away at the old industrial virtues of self-discipline, sacrifice and duty. </p> <p>What we need is a new, similarly powerful social ethic for these hyper-demanding times. Some other world view that can give meaning to our busy lives. Something that could make all these demands for 'creativity' and 'achievement' worth the effort. </p> <p> <b> I play, therefore I am</b> </p> <p> Welcome to the play ethic. First of all, don't take 'play' to mean anything idle, wasteful or frivolous. The trivialisation of play was the work ethic's most lasting, and most regrettable achievement. This is 'play' as the great philosophers understood it: the experience of being an active, creative and fully autonomous person. </p> <p>The play ethic is about having the confidence to be spontaneous, creative and empathetic across every area of you life - in relationships, in the community, in your cultural life, as well as paid employment. It's about placing yourself, your passions and enthusiasms at the centre of your world. </p> <p>By clearing space for activities that are pleasurable, voluntary and imaginative - that is, for play - you'll have better memory, sharper reasoning and more optimism about the future. As Brian Sutton-Smith, the dean of Play Studies at the University of Pennsylvania, says, 'The opposite of play isn't work. It's depression. To play is to act out and be wilful, exultant and committed, as if one is assured of one's prospects.' </p> <p>So to call yourself a 'player', rather than a 'worker', is to immediately widen your conception of who you are and what you might be capable of doing. It is to dedicate yourself to realising your full human potential; to be active, not passive. </p> <p>The play ethic is what happens when the values of play become the foundation of a whole way of life. It turns us into more militant producers and more discriminating consumers. It causes us to re-prioritise the affairs of our hearts, to upgrade the quality of our emotional and social relationships. It makes us more activist in our politics, but less traditional in their expression. And most of all, the play ethic forces us to think deeply about how we should pursue our pleasures - and how we reconcile that with our social duties. </p> <p>So, just like the work ethic, the play ethic is a set of feelings and principles. But the difference between the two is huge. Work is always (to coin a phrase) the involuntary sector - the realm of necessity, where men and women have to do what they have to do. But as Sartre says, play is what you do when you feel at your most free, your most voluntary. </p> <p>When every positive decision you make about your life carries both a risk, and a promise, of something new and challenging taking place. This is why the play ethic isn't 'the leisure ethic': the last thing it involves is slumped relaxation. </p> <p>Ever since the 'Protestant ethic' achieved its dominance in the 18th and 19th centuries - making sure that workers turned up at the factory gates every morning - work has tried to keep play's unpredictable energies at bay. </p> <p>Play has been corralled into the pen of 'leisure' and 'entertainment' - the workers' playtime, where we undergo 'recreation' for the next day's grind. Or it has been infantilised as an immature state of being, a permissible excess in the young, which all serious adults must put behind them. Or play has erupted through the cracks of our well-managed lives, as a series of counter- culture movements in the West - from the beats to the hippies, from punks to the ravers, from 'no future' to 'no logo'. </p> <p>Yet it's only over the last half-decade or so that the conditions have been ripe for the values of play to assume their rightful place in modern life. This is the grand loosening-up of Western societies, under the pressures of feminism, market forces, and latterly our powerful new technologies. These pressures have untied all those constraints of class, gender and identity which secured our loyalty to the work ethic. Men and women now live in 'risk societies', where so many more choices and decisions have to be made about life. What do I need to survive? Is this safe to eat? Should I stay with this person? What am I going to do now? </p> <p>Never before in history have so many individuals felt so individualised. We are 'developing a feeling for freedom', in the words of the German sociologist Ulrich Beck. But the values of work throw a damp, heavy blanket over that development. The work ethic was always about battering down our responses, regimenting out behaviour - all those Christian inhibitions that were drilled into the 18th and 19th century worker, so that he could divide himself (and his labours) for the better workings of industry. Being a player, by contrast, is about the freedom to be inventive, nurturing and modern. </p> <p> <b> Brave new office</b> </p> <p> Why must we kill ourselves... for work? The play ethic is an attempt to kick-start a new conversation about how we bring creativity and dynamism into the heart of everyday life. We can start the conversation in one obvious place - with the overlords of the new capitalism, both in politics and business. Stop trying to corrode our characters, in Richard Sennett's words - and start helping us evolve and strengthen our characters. </p> <p>If we need to 'get up to speed', then give us the right kind of vehicle, with the best possible fuel, to accelerate. Don't use your powerful technologies to regiment and discipline us, to squeeze more work out of fewer numbers and discard the remainder: use them to liberate as many people as possible into lives of self-determined activity and increasing fulfilment. Treat us as players rather than workers, and the promise of this new century might well be realised. Believe in us, and we might believe in you. </p> <p>The play ethic holds out the chance that people can indeed increase their capacity to cope with this intrinsically demanding future. But if we're going to advance ourselves, we can't do it by ourselves. To be blunt, a world fit for players won't happen without a huge and visionary reinvestment in the public sector, and an even greater rethink of standard business practice - both taking the maximisation of human potential as their aim. Yet the movements in this direction so far have been pathetically inadequate. </p> <p>We need the kind of tax-and-spend policies which would frighten the horses of the Treasury (despite the fact that each of these ideas are well-represented in the mainstream media and politics of mainland Europe and Scandinavia). </p> <p>But that's not all. We'd need a welfare system that invested in and sustained our non-working lives, rather than distrusted and demonised them. And a powerfully comprehensive education system, funded way beyond current levels, aimed at establishing an 'intellectual democracy'. And an employment policy which set industry-wide targets for a progressive reduction of the working week to 35 hours, with no loss of pay. </p> <p>On this, the politics of the play ethic is unashamedly democratic. It's the majority of the population, not just the much-vaunted 'knowledge elites', who should get to be players. Reducing work hours is one way (among others) of sharing out the 'clever' jobs. </p> <p>And no one should doubt that employment will be getting cleverer and cleverer. As US technology critic Jeremy Rifkin says, the industries of the 21st century won't require a mass labour force. 'But they will require the best minds working together with very sophisticated software and wetware - computer and genetic technology. The Industrial Age ended slave labour. The biotech and infotech century is going to end mass wage labour. So what are we going to do with everybody?' </p> <p>'We don't have a social and political vision', continues Rifkin, 'that is powerful enough to match these new technologies. We can't imagine what human beings could do if they're not needed in the marketplace or for government service.' </p> <p>The play ethic is exactly that vision - an attempt to imagine what human beings could do under these coming conditions. Not slumped in front of the television, not lost in a narcotic stupor, not listless or apathetic or passive - but an imaginative, engaged and active citizenry. Active because motivated, and motivated because there is an intimate, enriching connection between who they really are, and what they actually do. In the words of Brian Sutton-Smith, 'Play as the action in which we truly live.' </p> <p> <b> All power to the soulitariat!</b> </p> <p> So who's playing right now? Has anyone escaped the bonds of the work ethic and broken through to the other side? </p> <p>At the beginning of this new century, the social group that seems to be playing for keeps is the digital generation. For them, play is naturally what you do with your world: there's no angst or self-loathing about it. The technology that hovers like an axe over the neck of the traditional worker is more like a toy for them - a means of empowerment, not exploitation. They've left for the Playstation, these screenagers and cybernauts, and they're never coming home. This is the generation that was allowed to download their lives for free - browsers for nothing, web-mail for nothing, bootlegged software for nothing. So they've already got a weird, almost dotcommunist sense of property rights, which subverts the work ethic at its core. </p> <p>When the Net-Gens graduate from college, and go to the job market, the first thing they do is play around with the idea of a career itself. As a recent Industrial Society report says, these 'free workers' also want to find an emotional content in the work they're doing. They wish to cut deals with employers that maximise their control of their time, their environment, their personal commitments. They don't believe that fun and pleasure should be confined to after-hours: they want it when they draw a wage as well. </p> <p>They are neither the yuppies of the 80s, nor the downshifters of the 90s. They are eager to take all the opportunities that the new network society can offer, but wise enough to realise that wage-labour is only one strand in their life stories. </p> <p>We've been struggling to describe them over these last few years - Gen-X to Gen-Y, alt.dots to screenagers. Let's risk another term, which tries to express their playful balancing of employment, environment and experience. The bearers of the play ethic, right at the heart of the new economy, are a different kind of worker: not proletarians, but 'soulitarians'. These are the backpackers of Alex Garland's The Beach , using cheap flights and travel literature to make the world their playground. These are the ravers who grew up, but who can't (and won't) forget those blissed-out moments of transcendence, when drugs and beats blurred the boundaries of their selves. </p> <p>Great experiences matter to soulitarians as much as cool commodities. In the late 50s, the radical historian EP Thompson anticipated this in his famous essay on Time and Industrial Capitalism . Musing on what a post-work society might be like, Thompson suggested that its rhythms might rely 'neither upon the seasons, nor upon the market, but upon human occasions'. Which has happened: the soulitarian is above all a connoisseur of 'human occasions', from festival to tourist trail, from anti-corporate carnival to urban hang out. </p> <p>True players wield a huge bargaining chip in their dealings with the new capitalism. They understand the core political fact of the knowledge economy: you need my brains, and my heart, and my willingness, more than I need your money and security. </p> <p>The soulitarians happily flit between start-up and corporation, self-employment and job-sharing, being paid in cash and being paid in kind. If and when they work, they work because they want to. </p> <p>The fact is that you don't have to be a dotcommer to be a player. It remains the case that almost everybody can be a soulitarian. The work ethic was essentially mind control: industry had to find a way to exploit the worker's body - so it had to tether his or her mind with a whole weight of guilt, shame and status. But now the worker's body is useless, replaced by ever smarter machines, industry is left with the workers' mind to exploit - and that's proving extremely difficult. For every time you ask a mind to reskill and upgrade, you make that mind more aware of its singular talents, subtler in its workings - and, therefore, more demanding about the life it wants to lead. The 'smart' workers are getting too smart for their own good. </p> <p> <b> Play times</b> </p> <p> So the play ethic can be embraced by more than the digital generation, those dotcom munards playing the future with their mouses and joysticks. Behind the soulitarians are the lifestyle militants. They are older; more conventionally employed in the information industries; mostly parents with children, but singletons and post-marrieds, too. </p> <p>For them, being a player is about civilising the workplace, and then about putting work in its proper place. With employers, their demands are for virtual working rather than presenteeism, for collegiality over hierarchy, for information-sharing over empire-building. They want more free time because, with all their accumulations of children and partners, skills and experiences, they 'want a life'. And with the half-way point approaching soon, they're becoming militant in their pursuit of happiness. </p> <p>When our non-work lives become more significant than our work lives, we become less tolerant of our office pathologies - the power-games, the sharp practice, the empty values. The play ethic raises the stakes here: to be a player is to be confident enough in one's abilities to seek the best possible environment for paid employment - either by kicking up a fuss in the organisation, or hap pily moving outside it into self-employment (becoming a consultant, a freelancer, or starting your own company). Meaningful work and serious play become the same thing. </p> <p>Lifestyle militants come in many stripes, and with diverse motivations. For example, many women battling for workplace recognition of their parental responsibilities have been delighted by the increasing amounts of working fathers also joining the fray. </p> <p>But it's still a gentle tide, rather than a thundering advance. And perhaps one reason for this tentativeness is that masculinity in the UK is a mess. It's wandering somewhere between New Man, Old Man and New Lad. British men are cripplingly divided about their responsibilities to their partners, their children and their communities. In fact, it's rare to find men even willing to discuss these issues among themselves. </p> <p>Play might well be one new way of enlisting men in the battle for more free time. The wager might be: what happens when all work and no play makes Jack a bad father? As Anthony Clare points out in his recent book on masculinity, there are specific skills that men can bring to the nurturing of their children - vigorous games, fiddly projects on table tops, trainspotterish enthusiasms. </p> <p>One way to turn a recalcitrant father into a radical father might be to appeal to the permanent big kid inside him: it's ethically right to want to play with your children, to enjoy that activity in and for itself. If that doesn't place men side by side with women in the battle for more parental rights, nothing will. </p> <p>Of course, the fields of play extend wider than the family. Recent months have brought news of a backlash against parents rights: non-parents are beginning to complain about having to 'cover' for their parental colleagues, posing very uncomfortable questions for their employers. If John and Mary can get time for their children - whether they're sick, running in the school races, or grappling with Lego - why can't I get an equal amount of time off work? </p> <p>Proponents of the play ethic would answer: well, why not indeed? If we understand play as the exercise of human freedom and self-fulfilment, from birth to death, then of course the playtime of the childless and the single should be equally rated. Rather than set themselves against radical parents, the 'child-free' advocates should join with them. Together, they could make a powerful common front for more humane employment conditions in the mainstream of the new capitalism. </p> <p>The idea of 'downshifting' always had the faint implication of stepping back from an active life. The play ethic isn't for 'voluntary simplicity', but for voluntary complexity. That famous 'juggling act' - between work and non-work, individual and community, pleasure and duty - should be something which we enjoy rather than rue. But only because we've been to the best juggling schools that money can buy. Which makes us skilled enough to pick up the clubs when they fall, and get back in the ring, along with all the other acrobats, tumblers and trapeze artists. </p> <p> <b> Playing hardball</b> </p> <p> At this point, one can distinctly hear the hooting derision of the employers' organisations, several leading politicians, and maybe one or two trade union leaders. The play ethic! Good old British shirk ethic more like. Isn't this an argument for the return of the Skivers' Charter? </p> <p>Yet the play ethic isn't anti-capitalism, but capitalist reform - and it's no less urgent for that. Like the work ethic was in its own time, the play ethic is a sincere attempt to legitimise a specific economic order. </p> <p>The policy goals of the play ethic aren't rocket science: all have their benchmarks in normal European politics. Harmonising with France and Italy on a strict 35-hour week, which comes into full operation in both countries on 1 January 2001, is an obvious opportunity. </p> <p>The French experience has been mostly a political success: reducing unemployment, redistributing the smarter work among a wider social class, and even increasing productivity levels (by trading shorter hours for more flexible work patterns at no loss of pay). Yet, more importantly, it has released millions of French citizens back into their own lives - with time to socialise, spectate, self-improve. As Lionel Jospin says: market economy, not market society. </p> <p>The next target is a continent-wide citizen's income, guaranteed to all, bundling all existing benefits and tax credits into one payment. Here, the play ethic respectfully asks that the rhetoric of the Third Way line up with reality. How can those lower down the income scale be expected to become 'enterprising' and 'dynamic', embracing all the risks of the age, when one step away from paid employment sends them either into economic debt, or marks them with the stigma of welfare dependency? </p> <p>Reskilling, taking several jobs in a lifetime, adapting to different styles of working - this is all about work as a discontinuous, constantly uneven and surprising realm. How can this discontinuity be made an opportunity rather than a threat? We can only all be players if we are enabled to be so. </p> <p>Beyond the French-Italian axis, countries such as Holland and Denmark have had success with their systems of 'voluntary unemployment': every worker having the right to one year's leave in their working life, distributed as they see fit, with a state payment at somewhere around 60 to 70 per cent of their original wage. Apart from maintaining high-employment levels - and no noticeable reduction in national productivity - a citizen's wage enables people to feel that their non-work lives are socially esteemed. </p> <p>The last obvious policy is in education. There is already a gathering counter- consensus in the UK around educational reform, led by voices such as Tom Bentley of Demos, CreativeNet and the Scottish Council Foundation: they want to stop 'factory schools turning out factory minds'. The creative child can imagine new problems (rather than have them handed down to them); mingles ideas easily from one realm to another; makes mistakes, as long as they lead to more interesting solutions; and focuses on goals with all their powers of attention. That's a textbook list of the psychological attributes of play. </p> <p>Yet creative education should be about more than producing fodder for the 'creative industries', or a better class of info-worker. The democratisation of creativity could save lives - or, at a minimum, turn those lives away from self-destruction. If the play ethic means anything tangible, it is about occupying the gap that drug culture occupies in our poorest communities. And that gap is created by the distance between 'work' as it stands - Job-Seekers' Allowances, McEmployment of all kinds, the spiritual tedium of 'workfare' Britain - and the individuals who cannot (or will not) conform to its dictates. </p> <p>Drugs, you could say, are the dream-seekers' allowance: the most expedient way to boost your sense of human potential, when all the official routes heading towards that end seem rubble-strewn, or impossibly long, or depressingly unrewarding. What Ibiza has really 'uncovered', for all its reckless, oafish hedonism, is an inarticulate but deeply-felt rejection of the false dignities of contemporary labour. 'I'm largin' it' should be taken literally: it means 'My precious self is bigger than this mousy, pointless social role.' </p> <p>An education for creativity which wanted to be truly 'inclusive' would have to listen to this elemental and popular desire for playfulness. It's linked to an earlier, more carnival- esque Britain, evidently not entirely swept away by industrial capitalism. A time of 'happy Mondays' and 'the soul's play-day', when 18th-century Gloucester bishops complained about 'loutish mobs that are drunk with the cup of liberty'. </p> <p>Teachers would have to find ways to tap into these disruptive energies, and turn them into a repertoire of usable life skills. That means, among other new approaches, that the much-abused 'media and cultural studies' would at last get its proper curricular due. Bringing context and history to pop songs, computer games and tabloid TV could provide kids with an exit route from the cul-de-sac of these escapisms, into richer areas of cultural tradition and understanding. </p> <p>Economists who've read their Marx often talk about education as part of the 'reproduction of labour' - the place where the character of the good worker is made. The play ethic wants an education which aims at the reproduction of creativity, the nurturing of the good player's soul. Children should leave schools feeling motivated, in command of their faculties and capable of expressing themselves in ways which both please themselves and others. Why would such a child choose the temporary utopia of drugs over the actual joys of skilful self-creation? Why would they not choose to play? </p> <p> <b> Playing for keeps</b> </p> <p> Yet if arguments from the mainstream won't convince our new capitalist establishments of the need for serious reform, then perhaps a revolt from the margins will. The waves of anti-corporate and anti-globalisation demonstrations over the past 18 months, from Seattle to Prague, should be warning enough to the new capitalist establishment: they need to change their ways, and fast. If any movement takes the values of play to their most militant political conclusion, it's the 'no-logo' radicals so ably described by Canadian author Naomi Klein. </p> <p>They rub global brands such as Starbucks, Nike and Gap in their own exploitative dirt. And by doing so, they withdraw their consent from the new capitalism, in exactly the ways they need it most: from the head and the heart. We're not going to play your games anymore. We're going to play our own. </p> <p>And play they do - from their use of the net to co-ordinate global protest, to their subversion of billboards and public advertising; from the rave atmosphere of their street protests, to the humour and wit of their sloganeering. It's the combination of spontaneity and absorption, of applied creativity and voluntary action - in short, their identity as players - that defines their politics. How must those corporate marketeers who are trying to calculate the 'lifetime value' of future generations feel about these young semiotic terrorists, these gleeful 'non-sumers', who merrily puncture brands like balloons? </p> <p>The anti-globalisers are still groping for an overall theory, or a defined political programme. Yet, as they do, they should look beyond their own tribes - environmentalists, trade-unions, third-world-firsters, disgruntled students, the digitally disaffected - and realise how much change they could catalyse. </p> <p>At the moment the smashed shops and Monday-morning viruses to unsuspecting in-boxes (remember the 'I Love You' email?) are just shock tactics with diminishing returns. But, once the dust settles, what might the anti-capitalists bring to the politics of a play ethic? They might ask for fair trade, not free trade. For the use of information networks to co-ordinate global democracy, not just to facilitate the movements of global capital. For news media to reflect a much wider range of societal viewpoints. For marketing to talk about the efficiency, design and reusability of products - rather than emphasising the way they'll be the answer to our dreams. For political authority always to be justified, its legitimacy tested against the will of autonomous citizens rather than assumed. </p> <p>What's the alternative? That an aggressive, business-driven order provokes further resistance - which could be a destructive mixture of cyber-terrorism and social intolerance, the computer virus and the funda mentalist commune. A ghastly prospect. But not improbable. </p> <p>In the face of anti-capitalism, we have to devise a credible post-capitalism, a new balance between markets and society which can absorb all (or at least most) of the discontents that we all feel - from manager to tree- hugger, from worried mother to stressed worker. As a new 'spirit of capitalism' (to borrow from Max Weber), directing the new economy and its powers in the direction of human liberation, the play ethic has at least an even chance of striking that balance. </p> <p>Beyond all the high concepts, the vision of a more playful world speaks to something elemental within us. Perhaps it is because our earliest selves are painstakingly built from acts of play. The hand and eye following the mobile in the cot; the meal that becomes a table-top collage; the cardboard box that turns into its own, rickety universe. </p> <p>And perhaps it is no surprise that we adults feel tempted to suppress the intense, utopian joy of these memories. A time when the world was malleable, magical, under the thumb of our imaginations; a time when those around us were willing participants in the games and adventures of life, who shared our inexhaustible energies for the new and the challenging. </p> <p>The radicalism of the play ethic is that it asks us to seriously consider what the American constitution calls 'the pursuit of happiness'. And the roots of our happiness, surely, lie deep in our playful selves. As well as all the previous prescriptions, proposals and policies, we could do worse than to occasionally becalm ourselves and try to recover those early moments - when the art of life was easily learned and joyfully practised. </p> <p>So let's play. I believe it's our turn</p>",
  "<p><strong> Madame Melville </strong> Vaudeville, London WC2 </p> <p><strong> Napoleon </strong> Shaftesbury, London WC2 </p> <p><strong> Water/Wine in the Wilderness</strong> Tricycle, London NW6 <br></p> <p> <strong> Madame Melville</strong>, written and directed by Richard Nelson, is a discomfiting play, a chamber piece for three. It seems at first like laborious titillation: a Frenchwoman - a teacher of literature - seems intent on seducing a15-year-old American pupil, Carl. For Madame Melville (Ir\u00e8ne Jacob), sexual power takes priority over everything else. Bonnard's paintings are precious to her only because they remind her of a former lover; to prepare for reading Proust, she declares, is like anticipating a honeymoon. </p> <p>Jacob plays her as an unlikeable but convincing type: intelligent, superficial, a damaged femme fatale. Behind the flirtation is a loneliness which will lead to something uglier - abuse. </p> <p>As Carl, Macaulay Culkin (the child star of Home Alone ) is brilliantly cast. He looks like a lost boy: his smile curving upwards and then losing its way; his fringe as much of a hindrance as his manner; awkward, young. Culkin's voice sounds dry and weak, like someone emerging from a bout of crying. Madame Melville does not want to hurt him, she says, but there is no sign of her having even ordinary care for him - she doesn't even make him breakfast. </p> <p>We are in uplifting rooms (designed by Thomas Lynch) with walls as blue as copper sulphate crystals and tall shelves filled with books. There are white balconies seemingly unsupported, as if emblematic of the sudden affair between the teacher and her 15-year-old pupil. There will be nothing to catch him when he falls. </p> <p>Nelson is most at home with an epic scale in his plays, but here, as in Goodnight Children Everywhere, he sustains intimate dramatic tension beautifully. The unease - the arid, disagreeable atmosphere - never lets up, though it is lightened by anarchic comic moments. </p> <p>It is arresting to see a play in which a woman through age (she is in her thirties) and status becomes as exploitative as any man, as culpable and as cold, even in her most tender gestures. Madame Melville and her friend Ruth (played with spirit by Madeleine Potter), who lives in the flat above, are like a pair of corrupt schoolgirls trying to reclaim a naivet\u00e9 they lost years ago. Ruth seems unhinged, a fiddler on the roof with an unhygienic lover and a family she has abandoned somewhere in the States. </p> <p>Carl may be consenting, but he is being played upon, none the less. Where does such a story come from? It reminded me of David Mamet's Oleanna - without the protest (and therefore more insidious). It is a kind of haunting, a comedy where there is no reason to laugh. It describes an affair: short, memorable, best forgotten. </p> <p>French seduction is the theme of the week in the London theatre. <strong> Napoleon</strong> is on the rampage at the Shaftesbury. He has become a softie, with a caramel for a heart. Hang on a minute though, he's changed. He is hard, authority personified. Or is he, in fact, mad - a deranged figure in an army coat? This Napoleon does not give up or add up. Paul Baker pours into the performance everything he has got but has more than the Alps to scale in Andrew Sabiston and Timothy Williams's new musical. </p> <p>When he first meets Josephine, she resists him briefly (the gist is: 'Not this afternoon, Bonaparte.') Anastasia Barzee sings her way out of trouble miraculously, making even the most hackneyed lyrics tolerable. She looks beautiful, exactly like David's portrait of Madame Recamier (she even has the couch to pine and recline on). Michael Yeargan's set and Marie-Jeanne Lecca's costumes are magnificent: energetically luxurious. Yards of scarlet velvet, mists, chteaux, armies on the march in elegant silhouette, images of history passing by. </p> <p>A virtue is made of vulgarity. A vast, hinged mirror swings upwards dramatically to reflect Josephine and Bonaparte in each other's arms. A suitably obsessive cartography dominates the design: Bonaparte takes possession of Josephine on a bed that doubles as a map, in a spirit of global domination. </p> <p>Francesca Zambello is a marvellous director of opera but although her talents - and that of her cast - are much in evidence, their gifts are squandered here. David Burt's Talleyrand, for example, is marvellously good, but he has nothing decent to sing. This epic story needs thrilling, capacious, heart-stirring music. It needs to match Boney's heroism. </p> <p>If only Verdi could rise from his grave and make his way down to the Shaftesbury with a new score under his arm. Then the present score and lyrics could be banished to St Helena. </p> <p>Seduction continues to be the theme at the Tricycle. A double bill explores blackness and the way in which it is subverted, often by black people themselves. Winsome Pinnock's <strong> Water </strong> is an interview between an artist (Cecilia Noble), whose sensational work is said to reflect her life, and a journalist (Gary McDonald). The artist seduces the journalist. </p> <p>It becomes clear that the artist is intent on seducing everyone else, too, with a calculated lie. She is experimenting with authenticity and expectation. Winsome Pinnock's control of struc ture, of shifts of tone and mood is impressive. At the heart of this play is rage - about valuing black people for the wrong reasons. </p> <p><strong> Wine in the Wilderness</strong> by Alice Childress, a playwright in her eighties who, as a young woman, was an actress in Harlem, is an interesting longer work, directed with flair by Nicolas Kent. </p> <p>An artist (Ricco Ross) is at work on a triptych about three faces of Africa: the child, the good woman and the fallen woman. His model for the third picture is Tommy (the mesmerising Jenny Jules). She moves like a hyperactive tennis player and has some extraordinary aces up her sleeve. She will change the way the painter sees. Both plays show most movingly that the flipside to rage is rejoicing - for the right reasons. </p> <p>\u0095 Susannah Clapp is away</p>",
  "<p>Marian Keyes opens the door to her large yellow Dublin house. Inside, it is all razzle-dazzle colour: rooms painted lilac, neon green, azure blue, stinging saffron, unapologetic pink. The sofas are in lime and violet. The rococo mirror is turquoise. She herself is dressed to match the vertical modernist radiators, in a vivid purple top; glowing. She is small, even in her black ankle boots. She has round, surprised eyes in a tiny pale face. Her abundant dark hair swishes across her painted-rosebud mouth. Her voice is light, quite high. 'Feck,' she says repeatedly in her Irish lilt. 'Jaysus.' </p> <p>The effect - of the house, of the woman - is not brazen or comic or over-the-top, but oddly consoling. The house, she explains, faces north and, when they bought it, was dark and gloomy; the gaudy colours brighten it up. And her books do the same: her quirky romantic comedies spring from emotions that are actually quite shocking in their violence and wretchedness. Marian Keyes might be a 'feel-good' writer, but she's feel-good with a difference. </p> <p>'Darkness goes alongside proper comedy,' she says. 'The best comedy is rooted in despair.' But, she adds, she believes in personal redemption. 'Oh Jaysus, I do. I have to, because it is miraculous what has happened to someone like me, who was so tormented for so long.' </p> <p>She makes me coffee in a cafetiere. She doesn't drink it herself, and she says that she spent the previous evening rehearsing the making of it for my visit. She watches me anxiously as I take a sip. She is nervous about her new book. She doesn't mind reviewers, but she doesn't want her readers to be disappointed - and she has a lot of readers. Marian Keyes is 37. She has written five novels in as many years. Her first, Watermelon, was published by Poolbeg, a small Irish press, and then snapped up in the UK, instantly galloping on to the bestseller list. Then came Lucy Sullivan is Getting Married, Rachel's Holiday, Last Chance Saloon and, in two weeks' time, Sushi for Beginners, for which she received a four-book advance of over \u00a3600,000. Her books have sold nearly three million copies worldwide, they have been turned into television dramas and optioned for films. She is wealthy (the 67th richest woman in the UK) and famous: 'the hottest female writer in Britain,' says the publicity blurb. </p> <p>Her novels are often called 'women's fiction' and bracketed with writers like Jane Green or Helen Fielding. But where another heroine might worry about that extra glass of Chardonnay, Marian Keyes's will binge on nauseating amounts of food, three doughnuts and a loaf of bread, a packet of biscuits at a sitting. Where another heroine will wait to get her man, Marian Keyes's may wait and never get; may, indeed, discover that wanting a man is a frailty and an actual cause of her unhappiness. Her women get appallingly drunk, fake orgasms, throw themselves at men they despise and are repulsed by, sleep with each other's friends, hit their children, act in ways that unsettle our feel-good expectations. Rachel's Holiday is set in a rehab clinic and Rachel is a drug-addicted, self-denying, lying, infuriating mess. Often, her women are not in search of love so much as in search of, and in flight from, themselves. </p> <p>In Sushi for Beginners, Marian Keyes turns away from the stubbornly ordinary settings of her previous fictions to the world of a glossy magazine, but she demystifies the glamour. The three women at the centre of the book are discontented in familiar ways. They are all in search of happiness but looking in the wrong places, when, of course, the place they have to look is inside themselves. </p> <p>'I am interested in damage,' says Marian Keyes. 'I am an alcoholic and I can't drink again; I write what I find, not what I think other people will like, though if they like it I am delighted. I am interested in brokenness and addiction. I think we live in addiction-ridden times. I don't just mean drink and drugs. I also mean dysfunctional relationships, spending money, eating, exercise, anything. Maybe there's a spiritual vacuum that is the motor for these addictions. I write about ordinary, damaged people. Of course, that must have something to do with what has happened to me. I often think that there are some people who are born without one layer of skin; who have a propensity for pain, who don't deal with life in a resilient way. </p> <p>'I have a friend, Suzanne, who used to be my flatmate, and she's just a straightforward, grand person. Life bounces off her. I would have loved to have been like that; that joyous embracing of life. But I'm not. I'm me. And although I still have my bleak and terrible days, I feel more acceptance of myself. I don't regret anything, even the most painful things. </p> <p>'Nothing happened,' she says.' 'There's nothing I can find to explain why I was always so very unhappy. I had a good upbringing. I love my family. My parents weren't drinkers. I was the oldest of five, and I think I took the burden, and worried when I didn't need to. I was a grand worrier. I hated being late. I used to wear my nightie over my school uniform so I wouldn't be late for school. Insane. Nobody ever told me off, so where did that agonising self-consciousness and fear come from? Between the ages of eight and 11 my family moved a lot - from Cork to Galway and then to Dublin - and I felt an outsider. I never really settled. And my adolescence - well, Jaysus. Oh Jaysus.' </p> <p>Her hands float to her mouth with the agony of memory. 'I was small. I looked young. I was smart. That was a bad combination. People underestimated me, so I was angry. Angry and anxious - that's an even worse combination. I hated the way I looked. My siblings were all fine - my brother, who's three years younger than me, was affable and easy-going. My sister, who was four years younger, was chatty, charismatic; I was fiercely jealous of her. I knew I was different. Sometimes I wonder if I was clinically depressed then - I remember at 11 I had a constant feeling of screaming despair, I felt there was an ominous sky nailed two inches from my head. I didn't talk to anyone about the way I felt. I must have been ashamed. I thought that everything would be all right when I was an adult. It wasn't.' </p> <p>By the time she left school, she was drinking: 'It's not the amount that matters, it's the fact that it was important to me. I already didn't understand how you could drink and not want to get drunk. It was oblivion I was after. And I was different when I drank; I felt more like the person I thought I was supposed to be. I knew I was witty, quite perceptive, I could tell a good story, I was clever. But I always got in the way of myself.' </p> <p>She drank through her law degree. She came to London, decided not to be a lawyer, drank though her job as an accounts clerk. Drank more and more, 'pouring fuel on the flames of my misery'. Lurched through dysfunctional relationships, behaved badly, tested all her loyal friends. 'I still had an infrastructure to my life. There were people who were very concerned about me; my boss and colleagues were incredibly kind and patient. And Suzanne. I didn't understand - none of us understood - that I couldn't stop without help. It wasn't a question of willpower. I didn't know that one was too many and a thousand never enough; I didn't know I was an alcoholic, which seems absurd in retrospect, but denial grows in tandem with the disease, and as the drinking increases so does the need to protect it. I knew I was unhappy and I thought that without drinking I would have nothing at all. I was beaten by alcohol.' </p> <p>The final four months of her drinking were the 'saddest and most awful of my life. I was constantly suicidal and I finally tried to kill myself' - an attempt with alcohol and pills which led to her salvation. 'Perhaps it was my cry for help; I was so crazed with pain - the pain of being alive.' She came out of hospital and booked into a rehabilitation centre in Dublin, spent six weeks there - 'and that was enough to set me on the path, though I still go to self-help groups. I had never lived through anything painful without the help of drink. Every time I was anxious, I would drink. After the rehab, every time something happened and I dealt with it, I grew up a bit more. And it was difficult, but it felt fantastic as well, like learning to drive a car: Feck, I'm doing it. I'm doing it! Look! Taking responsibility for myself and my life. It was grand, wonderful.' </p> <p>In 1994 she returned to London, where she remained for three years, before going home to Dublin. She had already started to write when at her most depressed and addled - 'but now I took it seriously'. She also became involved with the man whom she was to marry. 'Tony had been a friend for a long time, we had a good foundation of kindness and being mindful of each other. And I no longer needed a relationship, which was why I could have a good one at last. Before, I'd always been looking for fixes. Now I was no longer angry or scared or desperate. I was being grown-up. I was writing. I felt clean, a fledgling adult.' The success of Watermelon took her by surprise. 'It was such a buzz, though - to have come from a place where I'd been so bereft and to have produced something I was delighted with and which had come from my quirky, tormented head. I thought: well now, it's OK to be me.' </p> <p>She continues to be surprised by her success. She thinks it is luck, and knows that one day her luck might go. When she was offered her second large advance, one of her friends burst into tears, saying: 'It's going to change everything.' But Marian Keyes insists that it hasn't. 'I'm not materialistic. I have what I want, I love my house, I love my car. I have money for family and people I am close to. I am aware that money can be a corrupting and destructive thing, and I am mortified that the people who sell and buy my books might feel I'm somehow not the same as them, and I am the same. I'm very close to my family, who treat me the same as they always have. I have a tight circle of friends. They are happy for me; they're secure in their own lives so why would they begrudge me? </p> <p>'People tell me I'm not going to win the Booker, and that's true, but there are different ways of having one's work validated. I respect what I do; I don't take myself seriously but I take my writing seriously. I'm not part of the Irish literary \"milieu\" [she puts on a fancy voice]. Jaysus, I'd be craven with fear. I stay close to my roots because that's where I'm happy to be. If my writing stopped, because I couldn't do it any more or because people no longer wanted to read it, I'd be upset. But there are other things in life. Travel - we could sell the house and buy a camper van. Or Tony and I both want to work with human rights somehow - we're bleeding-heart liberals really.' </p> <p>Three years ago, she and Tony bought this house, with its big rooms and a view (if you stand on tiptoes) of the sea. Tony - a Cambridge graduate and a computer analyst - gave up his work in order to work for her, 'clearing the decks' (she calls him 'ego-less' and says their working relationship is a 'partnership'). A year and a half ago - everything in place, the house decorated to make your eyes water, the room waiting - they started trying to have a baby. Nothing happened, and now they are seeing a specialist. 'It's like a syndrome,' she says. 'Women in their thirties who've put their families on hold, finding that it doesn't happen so easily. People tell me not to worry - but you know what, I'm not worrying. If it doesn't happen, I'll be very sad. And Tony, he'd be a wonderful father, he's so gentle, kind. But the two of us get on well and we will deal with it. I haven't written about it yet.' </p> <p>I ask what her next book is about and she says, 'It's about a woman who has had two miscarriages, and she's...' Her round eyes get rounder. 'Well. I never thought of that. Isn't that the strangest thing? So I am writing about it after all.' </p> <p>She insists that she will remain unaltered by success. 'I'm not better or worse for it, just luckier. And I've had to learn the dangers of not tying your self-esteem on to something that is so mutable. Failure is painful but survivable. I know that now. Shit happens to everyone. Sure, there'll be more shit coming my way. I just hope that now I can deal with it. I'm grateful for what I have, but it doesn't make me immune. Feck it, nobody is immune from life.' </p> <p>\u0095 To order Sushi for Beginners (Michael Joseph, \u00a316.99) for \u00a313.99, call Observer CultureShop on 0800 3168 171</p>"
