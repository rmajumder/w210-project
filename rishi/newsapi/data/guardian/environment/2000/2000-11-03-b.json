  "<p>Boo.com, the online global fashion and sports retailer, is the archetypal story of how not to do an internet start-up. </p> <p>Its dramatic collapse last May coincided with the Jupiter-Saturn zeitgeist conjunction in square to high-tech Uranus. It marked an epochal moment in the birth pangs of the new economy (Uranus) and some very old economic lessons were learned (Jupiter-Saturn), such as the need for financial controls. </p> <p>Fashionmail.com, a US portal, has acquired the name and relaunched Boo as a means of establishing a European foothold. It is no longer selling merchandise and aims to provide an entry point to global fashion retailers, manufacturers, catalogues and magazines. But will the new Boo fare any better?</p> <p>The original site horoscope (November 3 1999) shows a status-hungry Scorpio, keen on sophistication and glamour. Mercury, the planet of trade and networking, is in fiery, jet-setting Sagittarius, in alignment with dreamy, druggy Neptune, planet of fashion and hype. </p> <p>This is Boo, full of wild dreams, burning up advertising cash on champagne bashes for the fashion industry, boasting a multilingual Carnaby Street call centre. The air of fantasy is all-pervading, coupled with an unrealistic assessment of internet technology. Its much-delayed, 3D technology was so sophisticated that it crashed on most home PCs. </p> <p>Boo's Virgo Moon refused to accept criticism, insisting it catered only to people with fast connections. After blowing \u00a380m in six months, it had to end in tears.</p> <p>The new Boo, launched with a slogan of \"Style never dies\", turns out to be another Scorpio (October 30, 2000). Scorpio, the sign of rebirth, is linked to the phoenix, the mythical bird rising from the ashes, and although in this incarnation there is less hype, there are some worrying astrological repetitions.</p> <p>The technology shouldn't let it down again, but it doesn't look as if Boo will work second-time around. The fantasy line-up of Mercury and Neptune has become a tricky square, with Mercury moving retrograde - bad for communication and bad for trade. </p> <p>Fashionmail.com has over-estimated the pulling-power of the Boo name, especially now that the glossy fashion magazines are getting web-wise about multi-platform branding. If it is to succeed, Boo will need to find a magic ingredient to make its site more intriguing and content-rich.</p> <p>Email the Media Medium at <a href=\"mailto:maggie@companyguide.co.uk\">maggie@companyguide.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>It all began some time in the last century, in an age when lovers wrote letters to each other sealed up in envelopes. Sometimes they used coloured inks to show their love, or they perfumed their writing-paper with scent. </p> <p>41 Plough Lane,<br>Hampstead,<br>London NW3<br> <br> Monday, June 2nd 1980<br> <br></p> <p>Darling Ned -</p> <p>I'm sorry about the smell. I hope you've opened this somewhere private, all on your own. You'll get teased to distraction otherwise. It's called Rive Gauche, so I'm feeling like Simone de Beauvoir and I hope you're feeling like Jean-Paul Sartre. Actually I hope you aren't because I think he was pretty horrid to her. I'm writing this upstairs after a row with Pete and Hillary. Ha, ha, ha! Pete and Hillary, Pete and Hillary, Pete and Hillary. You hate it when I call them that, don't you? I love you so much. If you saw my diary you'd die. I wrote a whole two pages this morning. I drew up a list of everything that's wonderful and glorious about you and one day when we're together for ever I might let you look at it and you'll die again.</p> <p>I wrote that you're old-fashioned.</p> <p>One: the first time we met you stood up when I entered the room, which was sweet, but it was the Hard Rock Cafe and I was coming out of the kitchen to take your order.</p> <p>Two: every time I refer to my mum and dad as Peter and Hillary, you go pink and tighten your lips.</p> <p>Three: when you first talked to Pete and ... all right, I'll let you off - when you first talked to Mum and Dad, you let them go on and on about private education and private health and how terrible it was and how evil the government is and you never said a word. About your dad being a Tory MP, I mean. You talked beautifully about the weather and incomprehensibly about cricket. But you never let on.</p> <p>That's what the row today was about, in fact. Your dad was on Weekend World at lunchtime, you prolly saw him. (I love you, by the way. God, I love you so much.)</p> <p>'Where do they find them?' barked Pete, stabbing a finger at the television. 'Where do they find them?'</p> <p>'Find who?' I said coldly, gearing up for a fight.</p> <p>'Whom,' said Hillary.</p> <p>'These tweed-jacketed throwbacks,' said Pete. 'Look at the old fart. What right has he got to talk about the miners? He wouldn't recognise a lump of coal if it fell into his bowl of Brown Windsor soup.'</p> <p>'You remember the boy I brought home last week?' I said, with what I'm pretty sure any observer would call icy calm.</p> <p>'Job security he says!' Peter yelled at the screen. 'When have you ever had to worry about job security, Mr Eton, Oxford and the Guards?' Then he turned to me. 'Hm? What boy? When?'</p> <p>He always does that when you ask him a question - says something else first, completely off the subject, and then answers your question with one (or more) of his own. Drives me mad. (So do you, darling Neddy. But mad with deepest love.) If you were to say to my father, 'Pete, what year was the battle of Hastings?' he'd say, 'They're cutting back on unemployment benefit. In real terms it's gone down by 5% in just two years. 5%. Bastards. Hastings? Why do you want to know? Why Hastings? Hastings was nothing but a clash between warlords and robber barons. The only battle worth knowing about is the battle between ...' and he'd be off. He knows it drives me mad. I think it prolly drives Hillary mad too. Anyway, I persevered.</p> <p>'The boy I brought home,' I said. 'His name was Ned. You remember him perfectly well. It was his half term. He came into the Hard Rock two weeks ago.'</p> <p>'The Sloane Ranger in the cricket jumper, what about him?'</p> <p>'He is not a Sloane Ranger!'</p> <p>'Looked like one to me. Didn't he look like a Sloane Ranger to you, Hills?'</p> <p>'He was certainly very polite,' Hillary said.</p> <p>'Exactly.' Pete returned to the bloody TV where there was a shot of your dad trying to address a group of Yorkshire miners, which I have to admit was quite funny. 'Look at that! First time the old fascist has ever been north of Watford in his life, I guarantee you. Except when he's passing through on his way to Scotland to murder grouse. Unbelievable. Unbelievable.'</p> <p>'Never mind Watford, when did you last go north of Hampstead?' I said. Well, shouted. Which was fair I think, because he was driving me mad and he can be such a hypocrite sometimes.</p> <p>Hillary went all don't-you-talk-to-your-father-like-that-ish and then got back to her article. She's doing a new column now, for Spare Rib, and gets ratty very easily.</p> <p>'You seem to have forgotten that I took my doctorate at Sheffield University,' Pete said, as if that qualified him for the Northerner of the Decade Award.</p> <p>'Never mind that,' I went on. 'The point is Ned just happens to be that man's son.' And I pointed at the screen with a very exultant finger. Unfortunately the man on camera just at that moment was the presenter.</p> <p>Pete turned to me with a look of awe. 'That boy is Brian Walden's son?' he said hoarsely. 'You're going out with Brian Walden's son?'</p> <p>It seems that Brian Walden, the presenter, used to be a Labour MP. For one moment Pete had this picture of me stepping out with socialist royalty. I could see his brain rapidly trying to calculate the chances of his worming his way into Brian Walden's confidence (father-in-law to father-in-law) wangling a seat in the next election and progressing triumphantly from the dull grind of the Inner London Education Authority to the thrill and glamour of the House of Commons and national fame. Peter Fendeman, maverick firebrand and hero of the workers, I watched the whole fantasy pass through his greedy eyes. Disgusting.</p> <p>'Not him!' I said. 'Him!' Your father had appeared back on screen again, now striding towards the door of Number Ten with papers tucked under his arm.</p> <p>I love you, Ned. I love you more than the tides love the moon. More than Mickey loves Minnie and Pooh loves honey. I love your big dark eyes and your sweet round bum. I love your mess of hair and your very red lips. They are very red in fact, I bet you didn't know that. Very few people have lips that really are red in the way that poets write about red. Yours are the reddest red, a redder red than ever I read of, and I want them all over me right now - but oh, no matter how red your lips, how round your bum, how big your eyes, it's you that I love. When I saw you standing there at Table Sixteen, smiling at me, it was as if you were entirely without a body at all. I had come out of the kitchen in a foul mood and there shining in front of me I saw this soul. This Ned. This you. A naked soul smiling at me like the sun and I knew I would die if I didn't spend the rest of my life with it.</p> <p>But still, how I wished this afternoon that your father were a union leader, a teacher in a comprehensive school, the editor of the Morning Star, Brian Walden himself - anything but Charles Maddstone, war hero, retired Brigadier of the Guards, ex colonial administrator. Most of all, how I wish he was anything but a cabinet minister in a Conservative government.</p> <p>That's not right though, is it? You wouldn't be you then, would you?</p> <p>When Pete and Hillary both got it, they stared from me to the screen and back again. Hillary even looked at the chair you sat in the day you came round. Glared at the thing as if she wanted it disinfected and burned.</p> <p>'Oh, Portia!' she said in what they used to call 'tragic accents'.</p> <p>Pete, of course, after going as red as Lenin, swallowed his rage and his baffled pride and began to Talk to me. Solemnly. He Understood my adolescent revolt against everything I had been brought up to cherish and believe. No, more than that, he Respected it. 'Do you know, in a kind of way, I'm proud of you, Porsh? Proud of that fighting spirit. You're pushing against authority and isn't that what I've always taught you to do?'</p> <p>'What?' I screeched. (I have to be honest. There's no other word. It was definitely a screech.)</p> <p>He spread his hands and raised his shoulders with an infernal smugness that will haunt me till the day I die. 'Okay. You've dated the upper-class twit of the year and that's got your dad's attention. You've got Pete listening. Let's talk, yeah?'</p> <p>I mean ...</p> <p>I arose calmly, left the room and went upstairs for a think.</p> <p>Well that's what I should have done but I didn't.</p> <p>In fact I absolutely yelled at him. 'Fuck you, Pete! I hate you! You're pathetic! And you know what else? You're a snob. You're a hideous, contemptible snob!' Then I stamped out of the room, slammed the door and ran upstairs for a cry. The President of the Immortals, in Aeschylean phrase, had finished his sport with Portia.</p> <p>Poo. And more poo.</p> <p>Anyway, at least they know now. Have you told your parents? I suppose they'll hit the roof as well. Their beloved son ensnared by the daughter of Jewish left-wing intellectuals. If you can call a part-time history lecturer at North East London Polytechnic an intellectual, which in my book you can't.</p> <p>It wouldn't be love without opposition, would it? I mean, if Juliet's dad had fallen on Romeo's neck and said, 'I'm not losing a daughter, I'm gaining a son,' and Romeo's mum had beamed 'Welcome to the Montague family, Juliet my precious,' it would be a pretty short play.</p> <p>Anyway, a couple of hours after this 'distressing scene', Pete knocked on my door with a cup of tea. Precision, Portia, precision - he knocked on my door with his knuckles, but you know what I mean. I thought he was going to give me grief, but in fact - well no in fact he did give me grief. That is exactly and literally what he gave me. He had just had a phone call from America. Apparently Pete's brother, my Uncle Leo, had a heart attack in New York last night and was dead by the time an ambulance arrived. Too grim. Uncle Leo's wife Rose died of ovarian cancer in January and now he's gone too. He was forty-eight. Forty-eight and dead from a heart attack. So my poor cousin Gordon is coming over to England to stay with us. He was the one who had to call the ambulance and everything. Imagine seeing your own father die in front of you. He's the only child too. He must be in a terrible state, poor thing. I hope he'll like it with us. I think he was brought up quite orthodox so what he'll make of family life here, I can't imagine. Our idea of kosher is a bacon bagel. I've never met him. I've always pictured him as having a black beard, which is insane of course, since he's about our age. Seventeen going on eighteen, that kind of thing.</p> <p>The result of the day is that peace has broken out in the Fendeman home and next week I shall have a brother to talk to. I'll be able to talk about you.</p> <p>Which, O Neddy mine, is more than you ever do. 'Won a match. Played pretty well I think. Revising hard. Thinking about you a great deal.' I quote the interesting bits.</p> <p>I know you're busy with exams, but then so am I. Don't worry. Any letter that comes from you gives me a fever. I look at the writing and imagine your hand moving over the paper which is enough to make me wriggle like a love-sick eel. I picture your hair flopping down as you write, which is enough to make me writhe and froth like a ... like a ... er, I'll come back to you on that one. I think of your legs under the table and a million trillion cells sparkle and fizz inside me. The way you cross a 't' makes me breathless. I hold the back of my envelope to my lips and think of you licking it and my head swims. I'm a dotty dippy dozy dreadful delirious romantic and I love you to heaven.</p> <p>But I wish wish wish you weren't going back to your school next term. Leave and be free like the rest of us. You don't have to go to Oxford, do you? I wouldn't go to any university that made me stay on through the winter term after I'd already done all my A levels and all my friends had left, just to sit some special entrance paper. How pompous can you get? Why can't they behave like a normal university? Come with me to Bristol. We'll have a much better time.</p> <p>I shan't bully you about it though. You must do whatever you want to do.</p> <p>I love you, I love you, I love you.</p> <p>I've just had a thought. Suppose your History of Art teacher hadn't taken your class on a trip to the Royal Academy that Saturday? Suppose he had taken you to the Tate or the National Gallery instead? You wouldn't have been in Piccadilly and you wouldn't have gone to the Hard Rock Cafe for lunch and I wouldn't be the luckiest, happiest, most dementedly in-love girl in the world.</p> <p>The world is very ... um ... (consults the Thomas Hardy textbook that she's supposed to be studying) ... the world is very contingent.</p> <p>So there.</p> <p>I'm kissing the air around me.</p> <p>Love and love and love and love and love</p> <p>Your Portia X</p> <p>Only one X, because a quintillion wouldn't be anything like enough.</p> <p> 7th June 1980</p> <p> My darling Portia</p> <p>Thank you for a wonderful letter. After your (completely justified) criticism of my terrible style of letter-writing, this is going to be completely tricky.</p> <p>It just seems to gush out of you like a geezer (spelling?) and I'm not too hot at that kind of thing. Also your handwriting is completely perfect (like everything else about you of course) and mine is completely illegible. I thought of responding to your little extra (which was fantastic, by the way) by spraying this envelope with eau de cologne or aftershave, but I haven't got any. I don't suppose the linseed oil I use for my cricket bat would entice you? Thought not.</p> <p>I'm so sorry you had a row with your family. Would it help at all if you were to tell Peter (there, I said it!) that I am completely poor? We never go abroad for holidays, it's all my father can do to send me here and I know that it doesn't sound very left wing or anything but he spends all the rest on travelling between London and his constituency and trying to stop our house from falling down. If I had any brothers or sisters, I'd probably (by the way, where on earth did you get 'prolly' from?) have to wear their hand-me-downs, as it is, I wear his. I'm the only boy in the school who goes around in cavalry twills and old hacking jackets on days when we don't have to wear uniform. I even wear his old boater, which is almost orange with age, and the edge of the brim is chipped. When my mum was alive she genuinely used to darn socks for me, like some old Victorian. So my father may be a fascist (which I honestly don't think he is) but he's a completely poor one. Also, I told him that I met a girl in London and he was very pleased. He didn't hit the roof at all when I said you had a Saturday job from school working as a waitress at a hamburger restaurant. In fact he said it sounded like you had some initiative. And as for the Jewish thing - he was very interested and wondered if your family were refugees from Hitler. He had something to do with the War Crimes in Nuremburg (berg?) and ... oh, anyway I'm not trying to say my father is better than yours - I thought your parents were really nice actually - it's just that you don't have to worry about him disapproving or anything. He can't wait to meet you, and I can't wait for you to meet him. Most people assume he's my grandfather, because he's older than most parents, if you know what I mean. He is a very good man I think, but I know I'm completely biased. Anyway, he's all I have. My mother died when I was born. Didn't I tell you before? My fault really. I was her first one and she was nearly fifty.</p> <p>What terrible news about your uncle in America. I'm so sorry. I hope Gordon turns out to be a nice bloke. It'll be great for you to have a brother at last. All my cousins are completely scary.</p> <p>I just cannot wait for term to end. Thank God the last exam is over. I've been revising so hard that my head is bleeding, but I still don't think I've done as well as I need to.</p> <p>Boring school gossip, Number One: I've been made Head Boy.</p> <p>Ta-ra!</p> <p>We call it 'Captain of School' actually. Just for next term but I'll be too busy revising for Oxford entrance for it to mean much. (More on that subject in a bit.) Anyway, by the time you get to my age all the glamour goes out of authority. It just becomes hard work and endless meetings with the headmaster and school monitors - we call prefects Monitors here, don't ask me why.</p> <p>Number Two: the Sailing Club is going to the west coast of Scotland this August. The master in charge has invited me along. For two weeks: the very same two weeks you and your family are going to Italy, so it's the same two weeks we would have been away from each other anyway. For the rest of the time I'll be staying in my father's flat in Victoria and you'll be there with me as much as possible I hope! Are you going to get a job at the Hard Rock again?</p> <p>Anyway. Oxford. I can't bear either that I've got to come back here in September while you'll be as free as a bird. For two pins I'd forget the whole thing and apply to Bristol and be with you. It's not that I'm really so stuck on Oxford, it's just that I know it would break my father's heart if I didn't go. His great-great-grandfather was at St Mark's and every Maddstone since. There's even a quad named after us. You might think that would make it easier for me to get in, but actually it doesn't work like that any more. I'll actually have to do better in my entrance exam than virtually anyone, just to prove that I've got in on merit not on family name and connections. It would mean so much to him. I hope that doesn't sound chronically pathetic. I'm his only son and I just know how much he'd love coming to visit me and walking round the colleges and pointing out his old haunts and so on.</p> <p>I wish you could come and visit me here. Suppose next term I smuggle you in as a new boy? All you've got to do is squeak and look pretty, and you're very good at that. No, not pretty - you're beautiful of course. The most beautiful thing I've ever seen or ever will see. (You are very good at squeaking though.)</p> <p>I love your letters. I still can't believe all this is true. Has it really happened to us? Other boys here have girlfriends too but I'm certain it's not the same for them. They show their letters around and make a great show of drooling publicly over them. That must be a sign that it's really no more than a joke to them. And it isn't a joke for us, is it?</p> <p>You mention that strange thing about Fate and how it was that our school group was at the Royal Academy and how, if we hadn't been, we probably wouldn't have gone into the Hard Rock Caf*. That is such a completely weird thought. But then, when you came up to our table there were, I think, seven of us and why was it you looked twice at me? Apart from the fact that I'm such a moron that I was standing up. I really hate to disillusion you on that, by the way, but it wasn't politeness that made me stand up. I saw you and I stood up. It was like a sort of instinct. This must sound completely crazy - it was as if I had known you for ever. What's more, if I think about it, I could swear that I knew you were going to come out of that swing door. I had been feeling funny all day. Feeling different if you know what I mean, and by the time we got into the restaurant after sweating around the gallery for two hours and walking half a mile down Piccadilly I just knew something was going to happen to me. And when you started coming towards us (you patted the front of your apron and checked your ear for a pencil in the funniest way - I can remember every detail of it) I just leapt to my feet. I nearly shouted out, 'At last!' and then you looked up into my eyes and we smiled at each other and that was it.</p> <p>But you must have noticed the other boys there. Most of them surely taller and better looking than me? Ashley Barson-Garland was there, who's twenty times funnier and twenty times brainier.</p> <p>That reminds me ... I did something completely awful this morning, in Biology. It's a bit complicated to describe and I feel awful about it. It's not something for you to worry about, but it was odd. I read Barson-Garland's diary. Part of it. I've never done anything like that before and I just don't know what came over me. I'll tell you all about it when we meet.</p> <p> When we meet.</p> <p>When we meet.</p> <p>When we meet.</p> <p>I just CANNOT stop thinking about you. All kinds of wicked things start happening to me.</p> <p>Before I was born my father was a District Commissioner in the Sudan. I remember him telling me once that young men arriving from Britain used to go about in ironed khaki shorts and sometimes, if they happened across one of the beautiful Nubian women who went around bare-topped, or often entirely bare, they would have to turn and face the wall or just sit down on the ground there and then, where they were, to cover the fact, as my father puts it, 'that they had become a little excited downstairs.' Well, just imagining you reading this letter, just knowing that these words will soon be in your eyes, that gets me a little excited downstairs. A lot excited downstairs.</p> <p>So when I say that I'm thinking of you and thinking hard, you'll know what I mean. Well, I've gone and made myself blush now. I adore you so much that I hardly know what to do with myself except laugh.</p> <p>I love you to the power of everything, plus one. </p> <p>Ned X <br> <br></p> <p>Ned never knew why he had done such a sly and terrible thing. Perhaps it was Fate, perhaps it was the Devil, in whom he believed sincerely. </p> <p>He had slipped the book from Ashley Barson-Garland's bag, dropped it onto his knees and opened the first page before he was even aware of what he was doing. His right hand lay on the desk and pretended every now and then to slide backwards and forwards through Advanced Cell Biology. </p> <p>Lowering his eyes to his lap, he began to read.</p> <p>It was a diary. He did not know what else he had imagined it might be. It looked at least four years old. He believed that it was its age that had first attracted him to it when he had seen it peeping from the bag. He had seen Ashley carry this book with him everywhere and that had intrigued him.</p> <p>None the less it was very strange that he should have done such a thing. Ned did not like to think of himself as the kind of person who was interested in other people's diaries.</p> <p>It was difficult to read. Not the handwriting, which was very small, but clear and strong: Barson-Garland's style was - how should one put it? - opaque. Yes, that was an intellectual's word. The style was opaque. </p> <p>With each line that Ned absorbed, the drowsy buzz of the classroom fell further and further away into the background, until he was entirely alone with the words and a vein that throbbed quick and guilty in his neck. </p> <p><br> <br> 3rd May 1978<br></p> <p>Didsbury<br></p> <p> Firstly, it has to be the accent. If you get that right, you're close to them. You're halfway there. Not just the accent, mind, the whole delivery. Note the way the voice comes out of the mouth, note too the mouth's limited aperture, the line of the lips, the angle of the head, the dipping of the head, the tilting of the head, the movement of the hands (hands, not arms, they are not Italians after all) and the direction of gaze.</p> <p>Remember how there used to come a hot buzz of blood to your face on the bus every time you heard your name spoken by them? You believed for one heart-jump of a moment as they repeated and repeated your name that they were talking about you. You truly believed that inexplicably they must know you. They had recognised you as one of their own, displaced by some tragic turn of fate. The very first time on the bus, do you remember, they kept mentioning your name? Maybe you were going to be friends. How excited you were! They saw it in you. That thing you have. They spotted it. That indefinable quality of difference.</p> <p>Then you twigged. It wasn't you they were talking about. They had no idea you existed. Theirs was another Ashley altogether. An amusing Ashley ...</p> <p>That's SAY funny, Ashley.</p> <p>Ashley, that's a RAIL hoot.</p> <p>Despite the initial bump of disappointment that had jolted you like an electric shock when you realised it wasn't you they were talking about, it still gave you a little glow of pride and connection. Made you walk with a bit of a swing for a day or so, didn't it? Maybe your name, the name you hated so much, the name that shamed you, that you had believed to be so middle class, maybe, if one of them shared it with you, maybe it was an all right name after all. Could it be that 'Ashley' was, in fact, upper middle class, or even - you never know - aristocratic?</p> <p>Which one of them was Ashley, though? It was absurd, but you caught the name bandied so often that for a shining day or two you wondered whether they could all be Ashleys. Then you considered the possibility that Ashley might be a general name they used for 'friend', their counterpart of the ugly 'mate' that you heard every day in your concrete playground, just streets away from their stone quadrangle? But then you twigged again.</p> <p>There was no Ashley. Ashley did not exist. There was only an actually.</p> <p>That's so funny, actually. Actually, that's a real hoot.</p> <p>Can you actually, can you actually, Ashley, have ever really believed that they might have been talking about you? Did you seriously think that their lazy glances might actually, Ashley, have so much as taken you in? Sometimes your face may have been in the way of the arc of their gaze, but could you have truly believed that your identity, or even your face, ever actually, Ashley, registered?</p> <p>Yet they registered on you. Oh, how they registered. You looked at their skin and their hair and wondered how it could be so different from our skin and hair. From ordinary people's skin and hair. Was it a genetic gift? You noted the signature patch of flush on their cheeks, a hot scarlet, brighter by far than the dusty crimson bruise that stained the cheeks of the boys at your school. You noted too, on some, such pallor and translucence of complexion that you wondered if it might be their diet. Or the diets of their mothers while they still swam in the womb.</p> <p>What burned into your mind most deeply of all of course, was the Flag. The Flag of the Blest. Their Flag. The flop. The flopping fringe. The fringe that flopped. The Flop Fringe Flag. And how it made you ache. What a great hole grew inside you when you gazed upon the Flag. Like a Frenchman, far from home, catching a whiff of Gauloise. Like an Englishman lost in Asia to whose ears there suddenly floats the opening music of The Archers.</p> <p>Because always, deep down, you did feel that their flag was really your flag too. If it weren't for the terrible mistake. And the hole that grew in you, the great ache you felt was not envy, or covetousness. Actually, Ashley, it was loss, it was exile. You had been banished from your own, all on account of the Terrible Mistake.</p> <p>And you only ever shared a bus with them, what, five times? Six at most. You watched them climbing aboard and swinging themselves to the back seat, sometimes a hand would push down on your headrest and the proximity of that hand to your head would send you dizzy and you would try to eat the air around you, so deep was your hunger for what they were. For what they had. Breaking rules, probably. Skipping into London out of school uniform. The beautiful, the ridiculous uniform of tail coats and striped trousers discarded in favour of sweaters and cords. The Flag flying, free to flop without constriction from boaters and top hats.</p> <p>On the last day, the day before the Move North, you retrieved a boater from under the seat, didn't you? He didn't realise at first that he had come onto the bus wearing it. They teased him and laughing he had skimmed it down towards the driver in mock self-disgust. You nearly opened your mouth to tell him it was lodged under the seat in front of you as he passed on his way out, but you kept silent. Ashamed of your North London vowels. You retrieved the boater and you kept it. A shallow straw hat with a ribbon of blue. And afterwards you wore it, didn't you? In your bedroom. You're wearing it now. You are wearing it now, aren't you, you cheap, you creepy, you sad ... And it doesn't work, does it? Your hair is too coarse to flop like a wild Tay salmon or a swatch of Savile Row suiting, your hair bristles, like a bog brush, like a suburban doormat. In fact, you aren't wearing J. H. G. Etheridge's boater (note the three initials ... class), J. H. G. Etheridge's boater just happens to be On Your Head. Just as this diary is On The Table and this table is On The Floor. The floor isn't wearing the table, the table isn't wearing the diary. There's a gulf, a great gaping gulf of difference. And it is this gulf, this gulf that ... that's why so often you jerk off into this straw hat, isn't it? Isn't it, you miserable lump of nothing?</p>",
  "<p>In his role as Labour strategist, Peter Mandelson this week made \"neighbourhood empowerment\" in order to reverse urban disintegration one of the party's big ideas for a second term. Its elements are being put in place. Next month Whitehall takes upon itself the role of community champion when it launches a central unit to spearhead Labour's \u00a3800m national neighbourhood renewal fund. </p> <p>The is the latest of a string of taskforces, action zones, new deals and much more - designed to tackle poverty in particular places. Their statistical base is - or is supposed to be - a new multi-layered index of deprivation, collating 33 different measures from low income to poor health, unemployment and lack of access to education and training going right down to ward level in 88 council areas (<a href=\"http://www.regeneration.detr.gov.uk\">www.regeneration.detr.gov.uk</a>).</p> <p>The idea may be neighbourhood renewal but there is little doubt the centre will pull the strings: \"under-performing\" councils risk being bypassed if they do not start moving their poorest estates up the prosperity league. But there is also confusion at the centre and a contagion of \"initiativitis\" as Whitehall empires try to keep their programmes at the expense of policy coordination. </p> <p>That was recognised earlier this year when the Performance and Innovation Unit in the Cabinet Office - the very department leading neighbourhood renewal through its Social Exclusion Unit - called for more joined-up government. It railed against \"initiatives causing confusion, not enough coordination and too much time spent negotiating the system, rather than delivering\". People on the ground in councils and the voluntary sector complained of \"nobody knowing how all the initiatives fit together and several government departments are trying to target the same area at the same time\". </p> <p>One answer was to launch a coordination unit, under Cabinet Office minister Lord Falconer, and strengthen the role of Whitehall's offices in the regions - which had been created by the Tories in 1994 - to ensure that policies did not overlap and that programmes were delivered seamlessly. </p> <p>Such a remedy might make sense in a unitary state where most power is indeed concentrated at the centre, give or take local councils charged with delivering services and programmes according to Whitehall targets. But this government, we are told by other ministers, is dedicated to devolving power from Whitehall to the provinces of England, in the shape of new regional development agencies (RDAs) - and maybe, eventually, to elected regional assemblies. Already embryonic regional \"chambers\", comprising councillors and businessmen, with full-time secretariats, are shadowing the RDAs; indeed, some agencies and chambers have signed concordats to pave the way for more devolution. Many thought the RDAs would absorb the government offices in Leeds, Manchester and other regional centres but in the event the outposts seem to be policing the supposedly autonomous agencies. </p> <p>But now the RDAs are to get responsibility for the big neighbourhood renewal programme. That is because they are favoured by John Prescott's Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR). The bulk of their money (\u00a31.7bn over the years to 2002-3) comes from the DETR's regeneration budget and it has lately been pushing the case for full-blown English devolution against a sceptical Downing Street and Cabinet Office and (who knows?) Peter Mandelson himself. </p> <p>The deputy prime minister, when he is not occupied in trying to sort out the railways, says he regards devolution of power within England as the big constitutional idea for a Labour second term. He even managed to get a commitment from the party's national policy forum to support elected bodies which could, initially, be similar to the Greater London Assembly. It coordinates planning, transport, police and fire and runs its own economic development agency. </p> <p>Delegates agreed that the creation of elected assemblies, subject to regional referenda, would be an \"essential next step\" in the party's programme to renew the constitution. But Mr Prescott's supporters know they have still to win over Tony Blair if they are to get a firm commitment for regional government in the election manifesto. </p> <p>Mr Prescott is on the offensive. He has published research undertaken by his department which comes close to supporting the idea of regional government in a European context. It says that lack of a clear regional identity in the regions need not necessarily prohibit the creation of elected assemblies. Significantly, following a model in other European Union countries, it argues that an \"evolutionary and incremental\" approach might be possible. Some regions might press ahead where there is popular demand while others proceeded at a slower pace. \"Implementation need not be uniform\", it adds. \"Regional government in a number of countries is characterised by asymmetry.\" </p> <p>The problem for the Whitehall machine is that elsewhere in Europe it is regions and vibrant city councils - not the central government - which dictate the pace and the scope of neighbourhood renewal and urban regeneration. To do that regions and city councils need power. Unless wiser ways prevail in England, it seems that the centre and the regions are destined to fight it out for dominance - with programmes on the ground becoming the main casualty.</p> <p>\u0095 Peter Hetherington is the Guardian's regional affairs correspondent<br> <a href=\"mailto:peter.hetherington@theguardian.com\">peter.hetherington@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Craig Native, Colleen Dubane and William Ntamo are all young fashion designers. More than that, they are all young black fashion designers and, unusually for the fashion industry, in their circles this is the norm. Native, Dubane and Ntamo are leading lights in a new wave of fashion talent about to break out of their home market of South Africa and go global. </p> <p>There is little doubt that South Africa is poised to claim its place on the fashion map. Its fifth fashion week, held last month, was the first to attract international press and buyers, as well as major sponsors, including Evian and Ciro Coffee; it was also the first to have an accompanying exhibition, which has government backing to tour Europe. </p> <p>\"There's a push to make up for past wrongs and for companies to sponsor black designers now,\" says Lucilla Booyzen, founder and organiser of South African fashion week. \"The designs themselves are also becoming more international, moving away from limiting ethnic influences. Of course, it will depend on how open the world is to black designers, but I think South Africa is set to deliver amazing things.\" </p> <p>Cultural shifts in the country have been recent and extreme. \"Until last year, there wasn't really any high-profile black culture,\" says Charl Blignaut, editor of South African youth culture e-zine Rage. \"Then came Kwaito, music from the street which mutated from house. That launched a whole galaxy of black stars here and spilled over into other disciplines, too. So for the first time we have young black designers, magazines like Elle South Africa that focus on their work and black fashion editors.\" </p> <p>The expected flood of talented new black designers from South Africa may help counter somewhat stereotyped perceptions of black designers' fashion talents, locked as they have been in a ghetto of the baggy arses and big logos of \"street\", \"urban\" and \"hip-hop\" clothing. It's true that, to date, those few black designers with multi-million-dollar success stories have pioneered this huge market, notably Russell Simmons' Phat Farm label, 30-year-old Carl Williams' Karl Kani line, which last year celebrated its 10th anniversary, and FUBU (For Us By Us), the $350m business run by 28-year-old Daymond John. </p> <p>\"For black designers, there is this problem of stereotyping,\" says William Ntamo, who last month won Elle South Africa's New Designer award. \"The market assumes if you're black, you must be doing streetwear, nothing conceptual or sophisticated. But it is changing.\" Craig Native, for instance, has created the rock god wardrobe for Lenny Kravitz's forthcoming world tour, while designers such as Ntamo and Stoned Cherrie lean toward chic, top-end womenswear. </p> <p>\"The more black designers are seen out there,\" Ntamo says, \"the more perceptions will change.\" But the unpalatable truth remains that, on a global level, South African designers still face an uneven playing field. The number of black designers working in the international market remains disproportionately small. In the UK, Joe Casely-Hayford and Ozwald Boateng are arguably the only black designers of prominence, with ex-Prada man Lawrence Steele's Milan label holding the same tentative position in the US. </p> <p>To some extent, young South Africans are battle-hardened. \"You might expect things to have changed, but it's still easier for a white designer to get essential financial backing than it is for a black designer,\" Dubane says. \"I think in the end the boom in fashion here will change perceptions of black designers internationally, but in the meantime we still have the situation of going into a fabric store and a white designer being given a big piece and a black designer a scrap because the shop assumes only the white designer will be back to buy.\" </p> <p>The situation is no better here. Black British-based designer Wal\u00e9 Adeyemi, whose celebrity client base includes Victoria Beckham, remembers coming up against similar problems. \"When I started trying to get money or materials, there was definitely a reluctance when they saw I was black. I ended up making up a company name and phoning to say I was sending a student to collect stuff. I'd still go myself but then there wasn't any problem. Unless you're strong-willed, it's tempting just to forget the whole thing.\" </p> <p>According to the Organisation of Black Designers (OBD), the American professional association founded in 1990 and now with 5,700 members, this bias is one that afflicts the design industries in general. According to the American Institute of Graphic Arts, for instance, only 3% of graphic designers in the US are black. </p> <p>\"I don't think black designers being overlooked by clients and the press is intentional, but there are a number of social issues at work,\" says David Rice, founder of OBD and a visiting professor of design at New York's Parsons School of Art and Design, alma mater to the likes of Tom Ford, Marc Jacobs and Donna Karan. \"Certainly knowledge of design careers is limited among the parents of potential first and second generation black designers, and this can be exacerbated in a black community that tends to focus on ways to make money, be it via music or athletics. So there's no focus on design per se, only in as far as money helps you buy it.\" </p> <p>The problem is compounded by a lack of black designers to act as role models or mentors to those with an interest. \"People don't need to know that I'm black to like my clothes, but often they're surprised when they find out,\" says Adeyemi, who trained under Joe Casely-Hayford. \"Black culture has a huge influence on fashion but think of a big-time designer and you can't really name one who is black.\" </p> <p>Rice adds: \"While black designers may be in Donna Karan's back room, or like Steven Cutting, ex-senior designer for Perry Ellis, they're not in the foreground. And low visibility is a discouragement.\" He asks how many people are aware that fashion has a long, if low-profile, history of black designers - among them Elizabeth Keckley, a former slave who became personal designer to first lady Mary Lincoln, or Ann Lowe, designer to the Roosevelts and Rockefellers during the 40s, as well as designer of the dress in which Jacqueline Bouvier married Senator John Kennedy in 1953. Or even Stephen Burls in the late 70s, the only designer to win three Cleos, the prestigious US fashion award. Few would know of the Black Fashion Museum, secreted in a corner of Washington DC since 1988. </p> <p>\"It's because we keep a low profile that black designers aren't seen to be at the forefront of fashion,\" says Cyprian Decoteau, fashion editor of Pride, the black British lifestyle magazine. \"If you look at all the big fashion houses, there is a strong African and Afro-Caribbean presence. But whether we get the acknowledgment we deserve, I'm not sure. You don't want to seem to have that chip on your shoulder and say the industry is racist, but it doesn't seem very fair.\" </p> <p>Perhaps the South African new wave will be a force for change. While South African designers will not be quick to give up the African identity many have channelled through their work, their new-found international flavour makes for a mix as commercially minded as it is inventive. The big question is whether the colour of their skin, rather than the cut of their cloth, will prove a hindrance.</p>",

  "<b>1. Character </b> <br>  From beginning to end, the presidential election race has hinged on the character of the two candidates. Voters have big doubts about both <a href=\"http://www.AlGore2000.com/\" target=\"_new\"> Al Gore </a> and <a href=\"http://www.georgewbush.com/\" target=\"_new\"> George Bush </a>: the winner is likely to be the candidate Americans decide they dislike least. <p>George Bush has been marked as a grinning, <a href=\"http://politics.slate.msn.com/Features/bushisms/bushisms.asp\" target=\"_new\"> gaffe-prone airhead </a> with little knowledge of domestic issues and none of foreign affairs. Rumours about his behaviour at university, his conviction for drink driving in 1976 and videos of him drunk at a wedding party have not helped his cause. However, the Yale and Harvard-educated Bush is no dimwit, even if he doesn't pretend to match Al Gore for intellect and has never written a book. In fact his amiable vagueness is an attraction for many voters: it certainly didn't do Ronald Reagan any harm.</p> <p>Al Gore is leaden where Mr Bush is light, informed where Mr Bush is ignorant. His worthy plugging of the merits of big government means he scores well with the electorate on policy issues. But voters see him as excruciatingly dull: a sort of know-all teacher's pet. That is not the kind of president most Americans want and is the prime reason his campaign is in trouble. </p> <p>As a result, Mr Gore is trying to show the softer side to his character, kissing his wife passionately at this summer's Democratic convention and even giving an interview barefoot on a beach. Will this do the trick by polling day? If it does, the White House will almost certainly be his. </p> <p><b>2. Bill Clinton</b></p> <p>The sitting president, Bill Clinton, will <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,390837,00.html\" target=\"_new\"> influence the result </a> in two big ways. The Lewinsky affair and Mr Clinton's high-pressure fundraising techniques have tainted Mr Gore's reputation for moral integrity. That has been a big boost for George Bush.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Mr Clinton's success in combining economic growth with a budget surplus has helped the Democratic cause. Republicans have found it hard to convince voters that America has been mismanaged while Al Gore has been number two at the White House.</p> <p><b>3. Vice-presidents </b></p> <p>The battle of character extends to the deputies. Both were chosen to make up for the weaknesses of the main candidates.</p> <p>Al Gore is running with the Connecticut senator <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,351514,00.html\" target=\"_new\"> Joseph Lieberman </a>. As a strong moral critic of Bill Clinton's personal behaviour, he has added credibility to the Gore campaign. Not least because, as a devout Orthodox Jew, Mr Lieberman appeals to many voters doubtful about the integrity of his running mate. If Mr Gore wins, commentators will see Mr Lieberman's selection as a key factor in his success.</p> <p>Dick Cheney, George Bush's deputy, has had a lesser impact on the campaign. A prosperous oil executive from Wyoming, he has a long record of service in high office, including a spell as defence secretary to Mr Bush's father, the former president. As such, Mr Cheney has added gravitas to a lightweight campaign, but not enough to outweigh more pressing factors.</p> <p><b>4. Debates </b></p> <p>In a close year, the series of televised debates between the presidential candidates can swing the election. </p> <p>This year, Al Gore was widely tipped to crush George Bush in each of the three 90-minute official debates and romp to power. It did not work out that way. Mr Gore's aggressive style in the first debate saw him beat Mr Bush on points - but polls afterwards showed that voters liked Mr Bush's gentle approach. </p> <p>Mr Gore changed his style in the second debate, only to find commentators slamming him for letting Mr Bush's assertions pass unchallenged. In the third debate Mr Gore came out narrowly on top, but by then it was too late. George Bush had survived.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the single vice-presidential debate resembled a friendly fireside chat. Overall, then, this year's debates have settled nothing. The field is still wide open.</p> <p><b>5. Texas </b></p> <p>Al Gore is pushing the<a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,390883,00.html\" target=\"_new\">Texas factor</a> hard, claiming that his rival's poor record on education and pollution as the governor of the state makes him unfit to run the country. But Mr Bush's campaign has been just as eager to rebut all the claims and the tit-for-tat warfare is likely to alienate voters, not energise them. Republicans even point to Mr Bush's links with Texas as a positive point: unlike Mr Gore, they say, he is not part of the Washington elite.</p> <p>One issue can't be hidden, though: Texas' rapid-fire use of the <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,332204,00.html\" target=\"_new\"> death penalty.</a> Though both candidates say they support its use, many voters find the 150 executions Mr Bush has authorised as governor hard to stomach. Many others, of course, welcome the Texan's hardline stance on crime. The impact on election day is hard to predict. </p> <p><b>6. Ralph Nader</b></p> <p><a href=\" http://www.votenader.com/\" target=\"_new\"> Ralph Nader </a>, the green candidate, has found himself under the media spotlight in the past fortnight as commentators have realised that he <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,337255,00.html\" target=\"_new\"> could deny Al Gore the presidency</a>. </p> <p>Almost all his supporters are natural Democrats, whose support Al Gore will badly miss. National polls put Mr Nader on 2-5%, which is bigger than the margin of difference in many states and could hand victory to George Bush.</p> <p>As a results Democrats are piling on the pressure, asserting that a vote for Nader is, in effect, a vote for Bush. Will this strategy gain Al Gore a vital extra point or two in the polls? So far, there is little sign of it.</p> <p>Pat Buchanan, the fourth candidate, scores only around 1% in the polls - but as an ex-Republican running as a rightwing Reform candidate he will cost Mr Bush some votes. Mr Buchanan is most interesting for his running mate: against expectations he chose a black woman, Ezola Foster.</p> <p><b>7. Abortion </b></p> <p>The United States has always been unsettled about abortion. Many voters and politicians abhor it, while others defend a woman's right to choose. Al Gore comes down in the latter camp; Bush, almost certainly, in the former. Some voters fear that Bush will appoint hardline judges to the supreme court, who will overturn the court's crucial decision in favour of abortion. That fear works in Gore's favour. </p> <p><b>8. Big government</b></p> <p>Many American voters dislike federal government: they see it as a tax-hungry monster dominated by a metropolitian elite. Plenty of other voters, however, depend on the services that federal government protects and provides. </p> <p>The election race reflects this divide. George Bush, the natural home for big-government sceptics, has taken care to paint himself as a middle-of-the road moderate. And Al Gore, who really is a moderate with a long history of backing reform of the way government works, has adopted a more traditionalist, left-of-centre pro-government agenda.</p> <p>He may look back on this as <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,389546,00.html\" target=\"_new\">his big error</a>. By moving to shore up the core Democrat vote, he may have lost the support of the middle-class voters who twice elected Bill Clinton.</p> <p> <b>9. Health Care </b></p> <p>Al Gore promises action to control the cost of prescription drugs and to ensure all Americans have access to health care, a stance popular with older voters. It may be the reason for his campaign proving unexpectedly competitive in Florida, the retirees' state.</p> <p>George W Bush says much the same, but then describes Medicare, the state safety net for the old, as \"outdated\". This kind of talk worries some voters, though it reassures others who would prefer government money to return to them in the form of tax cuts.</p> <p><b>10. Taxation </b></p> <p>The healthy state of the US economy means that government income exceeds expenditure. The dilemma for the candidates is: what balance should they strike between tax cuts and expenditure? </p> <p>George Bush plans to devote half of the surplus \"to saving Social Security\u0085 one-quarter for pro-growth tax cuts; and the remainder to reform education, strengthen Medicare and support other priorities\". </p> <p>Al Gore proposes a complex scheme of targeted tax relief, covering things such as health care, the environment, business growth and college education. This has appealed to voters worried that a Republican president would slash welfare programmes, but alienated others who see Gore as an outdated fan of interventionist big government.</p> <p><b>11.Education </b></p> <p>George Bush has not made education a priority, in contrast with Al Gore, the traditional Democrat. </p> <p>Gore's plan involves greater federal supervision of the nation's schools and a sizeable increase in spending - another complex scheme which appeals to some voters and deters others. </p> <p><b>12. Foreign Policy </b></p> <p>Foreign policy issues have not made headlines in the campaign so far, but events in Yugoslavia and the Middle East have pushed them up front in these last weeks before polling day. </p> <p>Polls show that Republicans are trusted more than Democrats when it comes to standing up for American interests around the world. That's the good news for George Bush. </p> <p>The bad is that no one doubts that it is Al Gore who has a far better understanding of world affairs. The question is whether Americans want a foreign policy expert in the White House. The two candidates' strengths and weaknesses on the issue will probably cancel each other out.</p> <p><b>13. Petrol </b></p> <p>The rising price of oil has hit American motorists in their wallets and they are not happy. The issue carries dangers for both candidates.</p> <p>Al Gore has a reputation as an environmentalist who wants to reduce car use and regards energy taxation as a good thing. Voters who believe that he will increase petrol prices still further will be wary of electing him.</p> <p> George Bush and his running mate have both made money from oil companies, which many Americans see as one of the causes of rising gas prices. They may turn against Bush for profiting from their troubles.</p>",
  "Downing Street is discreetly backing moves to encourage tactical voting at the next election in a bid to drive the Conservatives further to the margins of the politics. <p>A Labour backbencher today publishes a list of seats at which only small numbers of third placed Labour or Liberal Democrat supporters need to switch votes to oust the Tories. </p> <p>The call is to be made today by Denis MacShane, the Labour MP for Rotherham and an ally of the foreign secretary, Robin Cook. He has received discreet encouragement from Downing Street and does not expect Tony Blair or the Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy to call openly for tactical voting. </p> <p>Mr MacShane recognises he faces a backlash from many colleagues who would prefer to fight for every vote. The deputy prime minister, John Prescott, has been especially critical of the Lib Dems, revealing he would have quit the cabinet if Tony Blair had tried to bring Lib Dems in after the last election. </p> <p>The Lib Dems have been unrelenting in their attack on the the war chest of the chancellor, Gordon Brown. </p> <p>Mr Macshane will nevertheless say in a speech in York: \"Liberal Democratic and Labour voters have an historic opportunity in the next election. It is to keep the seats won in 1997 and focus our anti-Tory fire on the most reactionary Conservative party seen in over a century.\" </p> <p>He will say Labour faces a choice between \"a retreat into tribalism - with its attendant ritual of insults and incantations or the continuation of an inclusive politics based on radical, progressive, tolerant ideas and policies which a broad majority of the population were willing to support\". </p> <p>He will insist the biggest prize is to ensure Labour MPs like Phil Woolas, Lorna Fitzsimons and Stephen Twigg as well as Lib Dem MPs such Vincent Cable or Jenny Tonge are not replaced by the new breed of Hague candidates intolerant on gays, blacks and refugees and anxious to get the levers of power to dismantle social Britain. </p> <p>Mr MacShane believes Labour voters need to look to the Romsey byelection result where Labour tactical voting helped the Lib Dems win a previously safe Tory seat. He will also point out there are 12 Tory seats where, if fewer than one in 10 of electors who voted for the third place candidate had voted differently, there would have been seven more Labour MPs and five more Lib Dem MPs in Parliament. </p> <p>\"All it takes is for a couple of hundred voters to vote tactically and we can push back the Tories to the margins of British politics. Labour in parliament has to be big enough to shrug off the cheap little Lib Dem squibs and gnat bites and show the British people that non-tribal politics in the national interest is what we are now about\". </p> <p>\"Economic and social questions are not where the Lib-Dems are strong but they speak for civic freedoms, for increased tolerance, for respect for the environment in language which makes sense to millions.\" </p> <p>House of Commons figures show that if 10% of third party votes switched to the second placed candidate - either Labour or Lib Dem - then 12 Tory seats would fall. If 20% third party voters switched, 21 seats would fall.</p>",

  "<p>The advertising industry is up in arms after the government made veiled threats to impose new limits on car adverts.</p> <p>A furious row erupted between the Advertising Association and the Department of Environment, Transport &amp; the Regions after the DETR said new research showed a possible correlation between speed scenes in car ads and the number of fatalities on the roads.</p> <p>The research, due to be made public at the end of the month, will show a link between the images that people see in advertising and their attitudes and desires about driving.</p> <p>Sara Price, head of public affairs at the AA, said: \"Antony Allsworth [head of road safety publicity at the DETR] is responsible for commissioning the government's road safety campaign. He is the driving force behind it and he's got to find a scapegoat.</p> <p>\"The DETR is worried that its own advertising has not had the right impact. Commercial advertising is always the easy target - they have to be seen to be doing something,\" she added.</p> <p>\"But there is a total lack of evidence. If advertising made the kind of claims they are making you'd expect to be hauled up in front of the ASA. It's easy to pick one or two ads and say the whole industry is wrong but show me how legislation would be any better.\"</p> <p>The government spends \u00a312m a year on road safety ads concerning everything from speed, drink driving, use of mobile phones and the wearing of seat belts.</p> <p>Many of them have used shockingly graphic images including the current \"belt-up\" campaign in which a child is hurled from the back seat to the front, killing his mother.</p> <p>A senior spokesperson at the DETR admitted that a single viewing of an advertisement would not influence behaviour and added that he had no evidence that people watch ads and then immediately act upon what they've seen.</p> <p>But he added that \"ads showing speeding cars can reinforce existing opinions and an ingrained tendency to want to go fast.</p> <p>\"If an ad shows a car going fast around corners viewers may think 'yes, I'd like a car like that so I can test it to the ultimate'.\"</p> <p>The spokesman would not say whether the DETR would seek to ban such car advertising altogether.</p> <p>\"What the DETR are saying to the ad industry is 'you will do what we say under the threat of legislation',\" said Ms Price.</p> <p>\"It's like putting a picket fence around a flock of birds and expecting them to stay there,\" said Rupert Howell, president of the IPA. </p> <p>\"If you don't want people to speed, don't make cars that are capable of doing more than 50mph or start paying more attention to what's going in film. It's pathetic. The government needs to stop with all this gesture politics.\"</p> <p>Figures from the DETR show that fatalities on the road are falling.

  "<p>Twelve months ago the new Mrs Rupert Murdoch was busying herself with choosing the curtains for their Manhattan apartment, improving her 69-year-old husband's diet and remodelling his wardrobe. </p> <p>Now the former junior executive at his Star TV operation in Hong Kong is taking a hands-on approach to helping News Corporation develop in Asia, its most important growth market. </p> <p>Wendi Deng, who is no longer an employee, is said to have helped to arrange an investment of up to \u00a331m in Chinese internet operations and seal partnerships with cable companies. </p> <p>\"Wendi gives News Corp a Chinese face in China,\" said Joseph Ravitch, joint head of the global-media practice at the Goldman Sachs Group. </p> <p>\"She represents not just the company but the owner, and that's critical in a country where families are very important.\" </p> <p>She is said to work for weeks at a time thrashing out deals in China while her husband works in New York and Europe. She is said to identify likely investments for Mr Murdoch, who controls about 30% of News Corp, valued at \u00a36bn. </p> <p>Mrs Murdoch, 31, who married her second husband 16 months ago on his yacht Morning Glory in New York harbour, has been working alongside his younger son James, 27, the chief executive of Star TV and the prime mover in Mr Murdoch's internet interests. </p> <p>Bruce Churchill, head of Star TV, a 27-channel service operating in 53 countries, said that although Mrs Murdoch had no official role, she was married to the chairman and chief executive of the company, \"so it seems natural that she has some voice in the business\". </p> <p>The revelation that Mrs Murdoch is doing more than choose the curtains comes at a difficult time for the company as it seeks investment to create a separate division for its satellite operations. </p> <p>It also comes after a year in which Mr Murdoch, who is constantly accused of running one of the world's biggest media companies as a personal fiefdom, appeared to have quelled fears that his sons were being catapulted to the top. </p> <p>Yesterday most US fund managers accepted that family ties were a useful way of doing business. \"Using personal connections is neither unusual nor illegal, especially in China,\" one said. Others have reservations, however. </p> <p>\"The problem is, where do you draw the line between your personal life and corporate business?\" a Boston-based manager said. </p> <p>Gary Ginsberg, a spokesman for News Corp, said Mrs Murdoch's role was \"minimal and confined to facilitating a few meetings in China and interpreting nuances of the Chinese market, which she is uniquely qualified to do\". </p> <p>Mrs Murdoch, whose father was a director of a factory in Guangzhou, southern China, arrived in the US 12 years ago, studied at California State University, and then graduated from the Yale school of management. </p> <p>Her husband said last year that their relationship prevented her working for News Corp and that this arrangement was frustrating for her. \"We'll just have to resolve that somehow,\" he said. </p> <p>Since then she has met Chinese politicians, including President Jiang Zemin, though she said this had only happened at large gatherings: she had not instigated meetings with senior officials. </p> <p>Mrs Murdoch is said to receive 100-odd emails a day from Chinese people with business propositions and to have helped complete a multimillion-dollar investment in netease.com, a popular site aimed at China. </p> <p>\"She's very keyed into all the News Corp and Star TV properties and how to better link them,\" said Anthony Cheng, founder of renren.com, a Chinese-language company with which Mrs Murdoch helped negotiated a \u00a36.8m investment. </p> <p>None of this comes as a surprise to Daniel Blake of California State University, who wrote her recommendation to study at Yale: he once predicted that she would play a role in opening China to business.</p>",
  "<p>Hopes among Britain's fuel protestors that yesterday's record profits by energy giant Shell will prompt deep cuts in the cost of petrol will be dashed by the chancellor, Gordon Brown, next week. </p> <p>Mr Brown is expected to forecast a budget surplus for this year far lower than the City is expecting.</p> <p>News from Shell that the tripling of the cost of crude oil since the start of 1999 had resulted in an 80% surge in profits in the third quarter prompted calls from campaigners for a windfall tax on oil companies.</p> <p>But the government - which was alarmed by reports that the public finances could be \u00a316bn or more in the black in the current financial year - was last night desperately seeking to massage down expectations of the size of the budget surplus.</p> <p>It is understood that the chancellor will adopt a deliberately cautious stance in next Wednesday's pre-budget report and predict a budget surplus that is likely to be in the region of \u00a310bn.</p> <p>Although that would still be twice as high as the \u00a35bn surplus predicted in the Budget, the chancellor is determined to quash any speculation of any massive pre-election giveaway.</p> <p>The Treasury shares Shell's view that the recent oil price is unsustainably high, and also believes that the severity of global and domestic competition will lead to a squeeze on profits and corporation tax receipts.</p> <p>\"We have no intention of repeating the mistakes of the late 1980s, when a temporary improvement in the public finances was wrongly thought to be permanent,\" one source said last night.</p> <p>The Anglo-Dutch oil company yesterday sought to defuse mounting anger over its profits by warning that crude oil prices could fall steeply next year.</p> <p>The company insisted that it made no money from its 11,000 UK petrol forecourts.</p> <p>Shell said its profits in the third quarter of this year were up to $3.25bn (\u00a32.1bn), a rate of around \u00a325m a day. But the company said this was almost entirely due to much higher oil and gas prices.</p> <p>Fuel protesters said the profits were \"scandalous\" and \"obscene\", and one called for a windfall tax on oil companies, including BP Amoco, which is set to disclose its own record earnings next week.</p> <p>But Mark Moody-Stuart, Royal Dutch-Shell chairman, said: \"These are exceptional results driven by an exceptional oil price.</p> <p>\"I have no doubt there will be leaner periods in the future just as there were in the past.</p> <p>\"After all, it is less than two years ago since Brent crude [the oil market's benchmark] fetched $10 a barrel.\" Brent fetched $30.45 a barrel in the third quarter, compared with $20.60 a year earlier.</p> <p>But Mr Moody-Stuart helped spark a fall in Shell's share price by warning that increased oil output by Opec producers and larger stock-piles could force prices down next year once this winter's peak of demand had passed.</p> <p>The City had already taken issue with Shell's $35m a day profits, arguing that they should have been higher and marking the group's shares down nearly 4% to 542p, the day's third-biggest blue chip mover. Analysts had expected profits of up to \u00a32.5bn.</p> <p>Shell said its exploration and production business had contributed more than 70% of its profits, partly driven by a $4bn cost cutting programme which is ahead of schedule.</p> <p>The group said 20% of its profits came from refining and marketing oil products, including its forecourt business which made no money - and had not for several years.</p>",
  "<p>I first met Anita Page in 1994, at a party in Beverly Hills. She sounded like Mae West and, in a long blonde wig, looked like a cross between Baby Jane Hudson and Barbara Cartland. She appeared uninterested in everyday life. All she really cared about was her Hollywood heyday, the era of the first talkies. She couldn't believe her fame had gone. </p> <p>A couple of years later, my brother and I began making a film about early Hollywood and got to know her rather better. She lives the life of Norma Desmond, rising at noon, when one of her assistants gets her dressed for the day ahead. Her wardrobe largely consists of remodelled dresses she wore in the 20s, to which she will add accessories once bought by male suitors. The furs are all a little moth-eaten, her long fingernails look like scarlet talons. The remainder of the day she spends watching herself in old movies. In her own mind, there is only ever one real star. The most famous, the most sought after Anita Page. </p> <p>She phones about once a month now to ask what we are up to, and to tell me of her latest projects (although she is in her 90s, she still acts, but not in movies that many will see) and what she and her entourage - a ragbag of assistants, nurses and hangers-on - are doing. She lives between her two houses in Pasadena and Beverly Hills, and says she wants to come to England and take the Eurostar to Paris. </p> <p>Listening to her is like listening to a radio that slips between frequencies, but her recollection of her movie career is crystal clear. She gossips to me about her rivalry with Garbo, who pushed her into second place in a most popular actress poll in 1929, and her hatred of Joan Crawford, with whom she starred Our Dancing Daughters in 1928. And about the parties she attended at William Randolph Hearst's mansion, San Simeon, with William Powell, Jean Harlow, Buster Keaton, Norma Talmadge and Marlene Dietrich. </p> <p>In one of our conversations, in 1998, she mentioned another name to me. \"I knew so many nice men,\" she said. \"I knew Mussolini. He used to write to me.\" Although she had told me many extraordinary stories, she had never before mentioned the Italian dictator. I pressed her further, she was not prepared to say more and I wrote it off as being too difficult, or inconsequential, for her to recall. </p> <p>Two weeks ago, however, I received another phone call. As usual when she rings me, it was 2am in the UK and I was asleep. The television was on full volume in the Californian background. \"Have I gotten you up,\" she asked. \"Yes,\" I said. \"There is a German woman on my TV.\" It was Leni Riefenstahl, in the news for a press conference she had given at the Frankfurt Book Fair to publicise a new biography. \"She knew a friend of mine in Italy.\" </p> <p>She went on: \"Leni was an intimate friend of Adolf Hitler, or so they say.\" She talked about Riefenstahl as if they were once rivals, though in fact they were worlds apart. Where Riefenstahl was making propaganda films for the Nazi leadership, Page was a hedonist whose principal concern was finding the next glass of champagne. </p> <p>I asked her why she is interested in the 98-year-old German film-maker. \"Well, it is just that Leni had Hitler and I had Mussolini. Maybe Leni and I should get together, you know, girls comparing notes.\" She laughed. \"I got the sweetest letters from Mussolini, real nice.\" And she started to tell me about the day they began to arrive - and about how, in the end, they would contribute to her being dropped by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. </p> <p>Anita Page, born Anita Pomares, signed for MGM in 1928. During the tail end of the silent era, she starred in a number of hit films, including Telling the World, While the City Sleeps and Our Modern Maidens. Broadway Melody, which was the first all-sound movie, won the best picture Oscar in 1929. \"I took MGM into the sound era,\" she takes great pride in telling me, \"and made them a huge buck.\" </p> <p>She specialised in playing amoral, hard-drinking floozies. That, combined with her looks, brought her a string of male admirers. She dated Charles \"Buddy\" Rogers, Douglas Fairbanks Jr, Prince Louis Ferdinand and Clark Gable, who wrote of Page: \"She was a unique beauty. When I worked with Grace Kelly and looked into her eyes I remembered Anita Page.\" And she received bags and bags of correspondence. </p> <p>\"Between movies I signed fan mail,\" she said. \"Or I modelled, or went on publicity tours. I received so much fan mail.\" To cope with it, she hired help in the form of her mother, Helen Pomares. She employed her father, John, as a chauffeur and her brother Mario as her gym instructor. \"I loved my family and they loved me right back,\" she said. </p> <p>But Anita would still open some of her own mail. She recalls finding the first letter from Mussolini in mid-1929. \"I was so excited. I was so thrilled, to open this beautiful adoring letter,\" she said. A second followed, which was opened by her secretary. Recognising the handwriting, Anita opened a third. </p> <p>In one week, Page found eight letters from Mussolini. Where other fans just asked for an autograph, Page says Mussolini's missives were more obsessive, more those of a connoisseur. As well as detailing every move she made in the film, he enclosed pictures of himself and begged her for a signed portrait in return. \"Oh, honey, his letters were so gooey, so sweet and actually so touching. He obviously loved what he saw on the screen - me.\" </p> <p>What did Mussolini actually write? </p> <p>\"Well, you English and Europeans are so romantic. I think Ram\u00f3n Navarro said, 'Why kiss the hand when the lips are in view?' I'm trying to think now what Mussolini said about my hands. </p> <p>\"He liked the films first, then me. Or maybe my appearance in the films made him want to watch them in the first place. My hair seemed to be a big deal - it may have seemed messy, but that was the look. He even wanted a slice of it once. I remember my mother wanted to send him a picture of me playing tennis. She may well have done - mother sent all sorts of pictures to my fans. My mother and father had to come over and put my photos in envelopes, you know, people wanted to own a part of me, I was big!\" </p> <p>Anita's mother kept a keen eye on Page's male suitors. She vetted them heavily, separating the eligible from undesirables such as Ram\u00f3n Navarro and William Haines - both known homosexuals. Each offered Anita their hand in marriage, but Pomares refused them. </p> <p>MGM was tolerant of Anita's flings, up to a point. But the studio's vice president, Irving Thalberg, was in love with Page and often made his feelings very clear. \"He like me to call him Daddy,\" she says. \"Nothing happened. I said to Irving, 'Admire me from afar, darling, and that will be just fine for the both of us.'\" Thalberg was married to the actress Norma Shearer at the time. </p> <p>Page had other problems with her studio bosses. Her rivalry with the sexually voracious Joan Crawford caused increasing tension at MGM. \"I ended up loathing Joan,\" says Page. \"For one thing she tried to hit on me several times. Let me tell you, when my mother saw the sex aids in various shapes and colours that Joan kept in her medicine cabinet, she refused my ever seeing Joan again - apart from on a film set.\" </p> <p>When the studio learnt that piles of letters were arriving from Mussolini simply addressed to \"Film star Anita Page, MGM Hollywood\", they started to get nervous. In part, says Page, this was because of Thalberg. \"Irving was jealous of any attention,\" she says. \"Of that I am certain.\" She says he refused to give her the role of Red Andrews in Red-Headed Woman (1932) because she wouldn't have sex with him. \"He kept saying to me, 'The film is yours but what are you going to do for Daddy?' I saw his manhood was growing in his pants. I became uneasy, as I turned and walked out of his office I knew I would not get the picture.\" </p> <p>She recalls a furious Thalberg reading out one of Mussolini's letters to her. \"I asked him, 'Why are you so mad?' I am a famous movie star at your studio and have an enormous worldwide following. I didn't think it so odd that someone like theItalian should love me.\" </p> <p>Studio head Louis B Mayer thought it would be a mistake to leak even a hint of information about Mussolini's love letters. Frightened of a scandal, Mayer ordered Page not to respond. Even sending him a signed portrait was strictly forbidden. </p> <p>Then another letter arrived at MGM from Mussolini thanking Anita for a signed print of her by the celebrity photographer George Hurrell. As she often did, Anita's mother had forged Page's sig nature. The star and her mother were called into Mayer's office where he and Thalberg questioned them about the thankyou note. Mrs Pomares said that a fan is a fan and her daughter never said no to a request, especially from such a prominent foreigner. </p> <p>\"Oh brother, I think Mussolini thought I'd opened the door into my affections. He wrote of my gorgeous lips and my hands.\" He also sent her gifts - she remembers perfume and a food parcel - but MGM sent them back with typed notes saying thanks, but no thanks. </p> <p>I ask Anita if she still had any copies of the letters. She said she would look. </p> <p>Over the next four evenings I telephone to try to establish if anyone in the house has located Mussolini's letters. Randy Malone is Anita's number one assistant and also notable for his appearances on the American TV show Singled Out, where he dresses in drag and mimics Hollywood actors. Malone was a teenager when he first met Anita at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel. Over the years their relationship has gone from strength to strength. Although he is gay, Anita has proposed to him dozens of times. </p> <p>The rest of the Page household consists of a nurse called Carol and a small crowd of gay men, all jobbing actors and all infatuated with Page. </p> <p>The house has been turned upside-down. Randy has organised a search party. The former child actress Margaret O'Brien, now in her 60s and another of Anita's entourage, has joined in. Randy whispers to me that he has to keep Margaret and Anita apart, as they are jealous of each other for spending time with him. Margaret has also asked Randy to marry him. Randy's partner, Mickey, is apparently unaware of the actress's feelings. </p> <p>In 1934, Anita married Nacio Herb Brown, but the marriage was short-lived. Two years after they divorced, Anita met and married an American admiral, Hershal House. They had two daughters, Sarah and Linda. Linda, who is an artist who also runs an escort agency, is in daily contact with Anita and her assistants. </p> <p>It is Linda who calls me next. She is visiting the house to help locate the letters. \"Mother is so pleased to talk to you,\" she says. \"She loves England. I'm helping the cause here right now. I did see one of the photographs Mussolini sent her in the old house, but since she has been here with Randy I haven't seen it.\" </p> <p>Like her mother, Linda lives in a time warp. In the 60s Linda's looks were reminiscent of Jayne Mansfield's. Today, at almost 60, she wears her hot pants bright and extremely tight. Her platinum wig has seen so much hairspray over the years that the strands are clumped together in a sticky mess. Her make-up is heavy and her eyelashes extremely long. </p> <p>I ask Linda why Mussolini fell for Anita over so many other movie stars. \"Stop there, honey,\" Linda says. \"Mussolini wrote to mom because quite simply she is beautiful. I say this because she still has her looks. Yes, they are still there, she like fell into the fountain of youth. You remember when you came out here to see mom and took her picture with a flash gun in your camera. Well, she didn't blink once. Now how's that for a star. She never went in for much make-up either; Constance Bennett hated her for that. Constance detested natural beauty like mom's. I have been blessed with mom's good looks too. How fortunate am I?\" </p> <p>I try to get Linda back on track: \"Did Mussolini write about how attractive he found Anita?\" </p> <p>Linda goes quiet on the end of the phone. \"Let's think. His letters had little or no formalities to them; he addressed her as his darling sweetheart dearest and called her talented and tremendous. Honey, Mussolini had it bad. He detailed every move she made in the movies he saw her in. He commented on every twist and turn she made. I personally think he liked the fact that mom was so vital. I mean she did all her own stunts, fell down flights of stairs... she could sing, too. She still does. Anita did all kinds of stuff. Mom was a beauty, yes, but I think he saw her being gutsy, too. I think I'm right in saying that Broadway Melody was his favourite. Later on when Mussolini hooked up with Hitler, Grandma Pomares got upset and felt guilty about the time she pretended to be Anita. </p> <p>\"Mom never spoke about Mussolini to my daddy [Hershal House]. Actually she didn't mention Mussolini at all until recently. It's too bad that Randy and the boys couldn't locate anything he wrote to Anita for you to read... </p> <p>\"What else can I tell you? Mussolini wrote in longhand and had pretty good penmanship. His English was all over the place but that didn't matter; the essence came through. The letter I read was quite tame, although mom did say he wrote of her bosom on one occasion. Isn't it crazy that my mom got stuff like that from Mussolini? Oh, he also wrote in green ink. I have to say that mom had no idea of what kind of man Mussolini was or how he treated his people.\" </p> <p>Anita's posse keeps her isolated from the real world. My interest in her correspondence with Mussolini has fired their egos. Each inhabitant has his or her own motive for hanging out at the Page house. All of them want to be in the movies. </p> <p>I have received five phone calls in one evening. It appears Anita is getting irritated with the contents of drawers and cupboards being scattered about the floor. Randy has found a solution. \"We have all told Anita that she is going to a premiere so she is now upstairs in the back room all dressed up watching herself and Buster Keaton in Free and Easy (1930). We will dig up the back yard if we have to, but we can't find anything yet.\" </p> <p>Getting desperate for hard evidence, I contact a former MGM secretary named Buck, in case he can throw any light on the Mussolini ephemera. \"Gee, that was some time ago,\" he says. \"I remember how mad Mayer got with Anita and her mother. He could handle her feud with Joan Crawford but found Anita's other baggage an irritation. When Anita's mother was sending that stuff to Mussolini, that was really the last straw for those two.\" I ask him if he ever sees Anita. \"Are you kidding? She's out every night. The big guy [Randy] gets invites to all the parties in town, even the Oscars. When they're out all dressed up they look like the Addams Family at Christmas and in full Technicolor.\" </p> <p>Next I turn to actress Marion Shilling. Page's junior by several years, she knows Anita from her MGM days - and afterwards, when the pair freelanced at minor studios in Hollywood. </p> <p>\"I was invited to Anita's 21st birthday party at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel,\" she recalls. \"It was a big party - Clark Gable, Jean Harlow, William Haines, Lili Damita and William Powell were there. Her date was Robert Young, she wore this frilly dress - pink, I think. </p> <p>\"Robert seemed a bit nervous: he stood on the dance floor, rigid, while Anita danced around the floor like a wild cat. She told Mona Rico and I about getting six letters from a gentleman called Mussolini. I only remembered the story when the war broke out and you heard about him and Hitler. I didn't think she knew who Mussolini was, though of course she knew he was important and most of all he hadn't sent a letter to Joan Crawford, so Anita was one up on her. It is strange how memories come flooding back. </p> <p>\"To Anita, fame was everything. I see her out at parties now. The poor darling, she's still on stage and cannot let go of the fact that she was once a star. But she was always charming to me and extremely well-liked on set.\" </p> <p>Finally I call the actor David Rollins, an other contemporary of Anita's at MGM. He too remembers the fuss over Mussolini. \"She was pretty open about telling everyone that Mussolini was in love with her. Basically I don't think she realised who he was. Until 1933, few people really knew who he was in the States. But Anita knew he was important enough to make a big fuss over the fan mail.\" He remembers Thalberg being so annoyed that Anita wouldn't go with him that he would have done anything to get rid of her at this point. \"What better way of getting rid of her than this stuff?\" </p> <p>A combination of events led to an end to the letters. MGM had done well out of Anita Page's movies, but she was increasingly being asked to pose for risqu\u00e9 photographs showing her in revealing gowns, and she baulked at the studio's request that she appear in public with men they picked for her. When she complained to Mayer about her treatment and asked for a pay increase, he flatly refused. Mayer bragged that he could make Page shine in three pictures - and that he could break Garbo in the same number. Mayer knew Anita had turned Thalberg down. He punished her by loaning her out to other studios for the remainder of her contract at MGM. </p> <p>Anita says: \"I'm sure where I feared to tread Joan Crawford, Constance Bennett and maybe even Jean Harlow didn't give it a second thought. Joan called him Papa. Irving was obviously so mad with me he ruined my career.\" </p> <p>After Anita left MGM in 1932 she did a series of tests for Fox and it appeared she would be offered a contract. Later she learned that the head of Fox had lunch with Mayer the day she was called to sign a contract, and the contract never materialised. Anita thought after she left MGM that Mussolini had given up on her too, but later she discovered over a four-year period that her mother had sent Mussolini a further 20 autographed pictures that she had signed. A mailroom employee at MGM told her that he sent her more than 100 letters. </p> <p>\"I never met Mussolini,\" she says, \"though I sure would have liked to. Honey I'm not saying that I'd have married him.\" She says he asked her twice. \"My father never liked the whole business. When my brother said he was frightened in case Mussolini came over and kidnapped me, father reassured us that Mussolini wouldn't get as far as Beverly Hills before being noticed. </p> <p>\"Mussolini may have liked me and I know I was real pleased with all the attention but really I think he was a bit of a pig.

  "Only a few short weeks ago it was a bike ride to a sandy beach for a swim which provided the entertainment. Last weekend, the powerful south-westerlies which brought havoc to southern England were only slightly less in force over the exposed Breton peninsula, so this time it was a bike ride as preface to a bracing coastal walk. <p>We rode down the hill towards Le Diben and saw, solitary and still in a bywater, a large grey heron. At Port Blanc, a splendid summer beach now filled with the deep rumbling sound of waves turning over the boulders at the beach head, we turned west and walked the coastal path. This soon became territory sheltered by the headland, the sun came out, and on the beach below us was an avian visitor, a little egret - a small white heron traditionally associated with southern Europe, but one of half a dozen we've seen on this coast through the summer. </p> <p>This elegant heron, yellow feet in the trail position, took off from the foreshore and flew east. They are clearly changing their normal range, because one winter a few years back we had a National Trust cottage for the weekend at Nantsallos, close to Fowey, and on the creek there, even as frost whitened the morning landscape, a little egret appeared. On the north Breton coast we've had a number of sightings, so along with the stormy weather, the tornado through Bognor and rain pouring down, perhaps this is a small benefit of global warming. With so many bird species in retreat, the little egret is a pleasant exception. I hope no one tells me that it's disappearing from its traditional haunts in warmer southern climes. </p>",
  "When I began a relationship with Rob three years ago he had just started attending Alcoholics Anonymous after many years of heavy drinking, which had resulted in the break-up of his marriage. When he and his wife separated, their two teenage sons remained with him. His relationship with the boys was often difficult but he always provided for them materially (hot meals, tidy house). However, he is the first to admit that he probably provided them with little emotional support. In the past three years he has remained sober and, through hard work, he has been rewarded with promotion and a large increase in salary. You would think that this prosperity and atmosphere of calm sobriety would unite the family, but it has only alienated the elder son. He has moved in with his mother, calling only to make financial demands. It's as if he feels that the only way Rob can make it up to him is to buy him things. Rob is willing to spend time with him but this isn't what his son wants. It's obvious that the boy has been damaged by Rob's drinking, but surely throwing money at him won't help. How have other readers coped? <p><b> It's all about fear</b></p> <p> You should accept that your letter is likely not be an accurate account of what is happening between Rob and his son. I experienced very similar circumstances to those you describe when my mother and father divorced. </p> <p>Rob's son grew up in an environment where there were constants: mum, dad, brother and heavy drinking. Younger children do not understand the impacts of dependency on a marriage and family, so the drinking would have been a normal part of what would appear to him to be a stable family unit. </p> <p>When Rob's marriage failed and he stopped drinking, moved away from the home, started getting promotions, a better salary and, most importantly, a new relationship, the father that Rob's son had known all his life suddenly disappeared, replaced by a different person with different values and priorities. </p> <p>I tried to reacquaint myself with my \"new father\" over a period of 18 years, and many of my attempts to begin to familiarise myself with him took the form of asking for assistance in some way. I thought that because he had rejected drinking, my mother, our family home and his old lifestyle, changing himself into someone different, there was no reason why he would not reject me as well. The only way I could see to overcome this was to ask for help, because surely no father could refuse to assist one of his own children. </p> <p>These attempts failed, and as an adult I understand why. But in the process of my father trying to stop these requests for money, I felt alienated from my father as if he had rejected me along with the rest of his previous life. </p> <p>How you cope with the situation has no clear-cut formula. If Rob's son is old enough to sit down and talk with his father about what has happened and how they would like their relationship to progress, then all well and good. But one thing I would stress is that any promises Rob makes to his son must be backed up in the future. It is likely that for a while the relationship will demand a lot of give and not much take on Rob's part until his son has seen that Rob's change of lifestyle makes no difference to his commitment to his sons. </p> <p>On the other hand, in my case, I realised that I had nothing in common with my father and that the changes in his life had made him a different person. I decided in the end that I simply don't like him - and that I didn't want to try to maintain a relationship with someone I didn't like. <br><b>Pat Douse, Norwich </b></p> <p><b> Self-esteem is key</b></p> <p> I think Rob's eldest son's self-esteem must be very low. For most of his teenage years, it was not possible to brag about his father, display him with pride to his peers or perhaps even to get to know each other through the fog of alcohol. Add to this the divorce which, unless it was handled exceptionally well, he was bound to experience as a rejection. </p> <p>Our son was 15 when my wife and I split up. For the first year, living nearby with his mother, he tried every way possible to play us off against each other, saying to her, for example, that I had refused him money for clothes when I'd already given him the full cost. </p> <p>Because he quite obviously felt \"spare\", she and I co-operated with great determination to motivate him towards independence and achievement - on his terms, not ours - and as he became more self-reliant so his self-esteem grew. As one example of our tactics, if he came to me for money for something he wanted (as distinct from needed) I would offer to match whatever he could raise on his own. </p> <p>One essential in this plan was that she and I kept in close communication - with the whole-hearted blessing of my second wife, which was absolutely essential. Result: A bright, well-rounded 25-year-old, happy doing his own thing in horticulture. I wish a similar good result for Rob's elder son. Just stay firm and don't forget, he would, if only for a while, have broken away from you anyway by now. <br> <b> A Whitehouse, Kent</b> </p> <p><b> The son has lost a role</b> </p> <p> Doesn't it strike you as significant that these material demands on his father and the escape to his mother's house have come about just when things at home were apparently turning out right? Is it possible that, now Rob is recovering from his alcoholism and becoming successful, he has even less time to give his sons emotional support and encouragement? I can see a sudden unnecessary and neglected feeling coming over his son. </p> <p>My sister's teenage son cared wonderfully for his invalid mother, even though this restricted his life. I often detected resentment, though he never let his mother see it. It was when his role was largely taken over by another sister who came to care for his mother that I saw a big change. He no longer wanted to do anything for her and, at the age of 16 was constantly badgering her and the carer-aunt for CDs, new boots, TV games, videos and so on. </p> <p>Because she felt she owed her son a great deal, my sister always gave in. But there was no reason for her to feel in his debt. Grateful and appreciative, yes, but not bound to fulfil his every whim. It's the same for Rob. His son has lost his role as his father's support through his drink problem and he has also lost his position on the moral high ground, so now all he can feel is resentment that his father has moved even further away and is doing very nicely without him. Hence going for what he can - material things. </p> <p>Rob doesn't have to keep paying up: boys are always touching their parents for cash and presents. But perhaps he can do a lot more male-bonding activities with them. <br> <b> Wendy Andrews, Leics</b> </p> <p><b>Next week</b> </p> <p>Recently I discovered that my wife had been unfaithful for the fourth time in our 17-year marriage. The latest affair is the continuation of something that had, I believed, ended six years ago. </p> <p>On discovery we ran the usual gamut of denial, excuses and promises, but it all rang very hollow. I have now asked her to leave so that my daughters and I can get on with our lives. </p> <p>The problem is that she flatly refuses to go, insisting that her place is with the girls. It is my income and hard work that has paid our mortgage, the bills and virtually everything else. I have helped out at home more than any man I know. I am not about to let years of struggle and labour go now. If our roles were reversed I would lose everything, like all the other men who \"play away\", but she seems oblivious of the consequences of her behaviour. </p> <p>My rage at how I have been treated is almost beyond control.

  "The government should introduce a system of graded fuel pricing determined by the distance of the fuel supply from urban centres or, rather, by population density (Blair takes fight to fuel protesters, November 2). <p>Customers buying fuel in densely populated urban areas - where there is (or should be) a well-developed public transport system, where traffic congestion and pollution are problematic, and where resources are easily accessible - would then pay a high premium. Those in isolated rural areas - where public transport is limited and resources are further afield - would pay a reduced price. </p> <p>The government would be seen to be acting green while not penalising the countryside - and addressing some of the protesters' concerns. <br><b> Charlie McCallum</b><br> London </p> <p>So Tony Blair tells the protesters that fuel taxes must be maintained at their present levels because they are essential for funding the wholesome public services like health and education.

  "Paul Brown appears to have accepted the Royal Park Authority's line on Richmond Park without any critical examination (Horns of a dilemma, November 1). The road around the park is an important element of the local traffic network. Closure or restrictions on its use is likely to have a very serious impact on the local urban environment outside the park gates. <p>Traffic flow in the park at peak times is effectively self-limiting and has not noticeably increased over at least the last 10 years. The concept of the road being used as a \"race track\" is laughable traffic invariably moves at a sedate pace, to such an extent that the park's police no longer even bother to operate the occasional radar speed trap. </p> <p>Free access to the park at all times by pedestrians is an ancient right dating back to its annexation and enclosure by the crown for hunting, and vehicular access has been a right since the use of horse-drawn carriages. The RPA's agenda deserves very careful scrutiny. </p> <p>The RPA need to consider the impact of their actions on the community, and to maximise accessibility and utilisation of this urban resource. </p> <p><b>Andy Smith</b><br> Kingston-upon-Thames, <br>Surrey</p>",
  "<p>An inch of rain in just an hour wreaked havoc across England and Wales yesterday in what is fast becoming the most widespread flood in British history. </p> <p>The environment agency said rivers are rising rapidly as a band of torrential rain moves across the country from Pembrokeshire to Kent. The floods are now more extensive and in places more severe than those of the Great Flood of 1947. </p> <p>The devastation prompted a visit from Tony Blair to emergency services staff in Shrewsbury in Shropshire, Bewdley in Worcestershire and York, areas still inundated by rising waters. </p> <p>The prime minister admitted that more needed to be done to bolster flood defences. He said: \"Thousands of people up and down the country have been amazingly stoical in these circumstances. </p> <p>\"In the longer term, we have to try to work to deal with these problems on not just a national level but on an international level. We have to put in the right protection for people against the possibility of floods and work to deal with the issue of climate change.\" </p> <p>His visits, by helicopter, coincided with a further degradation in the road and rail infrastructure with Railtrack admitting that parts of the network will be closed for a week or more because of flood damage. The floor of the Sapperton tunnel on the Swindon to Gloucester line collapsed and may take five weeks to reopen. </p> <p>Emergency teams were nervously watching river levels throughout Yorkshire last night, after drenchings in the Pennines. In the west, Shropshire was hit by 98 floods which has cost the local authority \u00a3450,000 with the final bill expected to be significantly more. </p> <p>Part of Worcester Royal Infirmary was evacuated, as was a residential caravan park in Stourport. In Shrewsbury, the town centre was impassable and waters reached the city's ancient abbey. More than 200 homes were flooded. </p> <p>More than 200 families along the swollen Aire in Skipton, north Yorkshire, bedded down for a third night in hotels and bed-and-breakfasts while major road bridges between Skipton and Leeds opened and closed erratically as the water level fluctuated. The Aire Valley rail link between Shipley and Leeds is not expected to open for a week. </p> <p>The east coast main line between York and Darlington was also closed yesterday, when floods from the Ouse and Derwent covered the tracks. In the worst-hit areas of Yorkshire loss adjusters have started work on flood damage. Bills totalling several million pounds are expected, but local councils and insurance companies said that it was too early to assess the likely final total. </p> <p><strong>Insurance claims</strong><br> </p> <p>Homeowners hit by floods could see premiums rise by up to 60%, insurance experts warned yesterday, as brokers predicted the industry would claw back the costs of claims expected to top \u00a3200m. </p> <p>Insurance companies have even contemplated refusing insurance to those homes repeatedly hit by floods in an attempt to curb the rising costs of underwriting properties in flood plains. </p> <p>Already the damage has equalled that caused earlier this month by floods and while well below the estimated \u00a32bn cost of claims arising out of the 1990 storms, the Association of British Insurers has warned of a change in how insurers will view homes and businesses sited in areas vulnerable to repeated flooding. </p> <p>Insurance giants Norwich Union said it had received well in excess of 10,000 claims since Sunday. Most homes escaped major structural damage but problems had been compounded by the savageryof the recent storms causing damaged gutters from fallen trees and debris. </p> <p>Legal and General said the bulk of its claims had involved storm damage to roof tiles, guttering and conservatories. None of its claims related to homes hit more than once by floods. Insurance analysts said it could be weeks before an accurate assessment of damage could be made. The key factor would be the extent of the damage, with rivers still rising in areas. </p> <p>Flood claims were already coming in from a wide range of areas including the south-east, south-west, south Wales and the Severn valley, and north London. </p> <p>Vic Rance, a spokesman for the Association of British Insurers, said the average cost facing flood-hit homes would be around \u00a310,000 to \u00a315,000. But he warned that areas in high risk areas could start to see insurance cover refused unless flood measures are put in place. </p> <p>\"Unless flood prevention measures are taken in future, insurance companies will start putting sizeable excesses on policies in high risk areas or in the worst case scenario will refuse to insure for flood damage,\" he said. An insurance assessor, Jeffrey Salmon, of Salmon Assessors, said the total bill for insurance companies would hit \u00a31.2bn plus a further \u00a3800m for those people that are uninsured. \"Undoubtedly premiums will skyrocket nationwide - by 40-60% in next six months,\" he said. </p> <p>The flooding was having severe financial implications for business and industry and the road and rail networks. </p> <p>The Association of Train Operating Companies said train operators were losing about \u00a32m a day in income from fewer people travelling and compensation to passengers for late trains. The environment agency is warning that further severe weather has been forecast for Sunday.</p>",

  "Radioactive contamination of rivers around a top-secret Russian nuclear weapons complex in Siberia has reached \"staggering\" levels, the worst ever monitored, and is out of \"rational control\", a joint team of Russian and American radiation monitors said yesterday. <p>Following a monitoring expedition in July and August to the closed plutonium complex at Seversk, near Tomsk in western Siberia, the Russian and American nuclear watchdogs said they had registered alarming levels of radioactivity in tributaries of the River Ob, a key Siberian waterway. </p> <p>\"We've never encountered such radiation. It's the worst contamination we've found,\" said Sergei Pashchenko, a Novosibirsk professor and atmospheric pollution expert who headed the Russian side of the survey carried out by Siberian Scientists for Global Responsibility and Government Accountability Project. </p> <p>The director of the American watchdog, Tom Carpenter, said: \"We were shocked at the levels of contamination.\" </p> <p>The environmentalists said they found levels of caesium and strontium-90 vastly exceeding safety levels in the rivers Tom and Romashka close to the \"Siberian Chemical Complex\", a sprawling facility established by the former Soviet Union in the 1950s to make weapons-grade plutonium for warheads. </p> <p>But even more disturbingly, said Mr Pashchenko, plant life in the rivers contained high levels of phosphorus-32 which decays within a couple of weeks, meaning that the radioactive effluent was of very recent origin whereas the strontium and the caesium could date back to the 1960s. </p> <p>\"The phosphorus-32 is a very short-lived isotope and this means they are very fresh,\" said Mr Pashchenko. </p> <p>The closed nuclear town of Seversk is effectively a suburb of Tomsk, a city with a population of half-a-million in western Siberia. Seversk was born in 1949, at the very onset of the superpowers' nuclear arms race. </p> <p>It ranked among the top three sites for the manufacturing of weapons-grade plutonium and uranium enrichment for the Soviet Union's nuclear arsenal throughout the cold war. </p> <p>The plutonium was manufactured from five nuclear reactors commissioned between 1955 and 1967. \"They are very old reactors and very unsafe,\" said Igor Forofontov, radiation specialist with Greenpeace in Moscow. </p> <p>The three oldest reactors were closed between 1990 and 1992, and, under a 1992 agreement between Moscow and Washington aimed at halting plutonium production, all five reactors should have been closed down by this year. </p> <p>But two reactors are still operating, providing heating and electricity to Tomsk. \"The authorities have no intention of closing them,\" Mr Forofontov said. </p> <p>An explosion ripped through the plant in 1993 which resulted in large amounts of radioactivity being emitted. Mr Forofontov also said lethal amounts of radioactivity were leaking into the soil and the water in the region because of the practice of storing waste from the reactors in liquid form which is then pumped deep below ground. </p> <p>Last summer, the Russian monitors spent two months touring the most sensitive nuclear materials production installations - one of the most dangerous legacies of the Soviet era - at Chelyabinsk, Krasnoyarsk, Novosibirsk, and Tomsk. </p> <p>But the environmentalists' findings in Tomsk were the most alarming. \"The nuclear waste is being piped straight into the environment,\" said Norm Buske, one of the American researchers and an oceanographer and physicist. \"This has not been done anywhere in the world since the cold war.\" </p> <p>The monitors were unable to pinpoint the source of the pollution because they were not granted access to the secret plant. Mr Pashchenko and 10 of his colleagues were detained for six hours questioning by the FSB, the successor to the KGB, while carrying out research around Novosibirsk last summer. </p> <p>At Seversk they were told the town was closed but that they could carry out research in the rivers a few miles away. The environmentalists found contaminated fish with radioactivity more than 20 times the safety level, they said.</p>",

  "<p>Digby Jones has all the normal symbols of the modern boardroom in his office. There's the picture of Digby swooping down the piste, and there's the piece of management consultancy gobbledegook - \"if you think you are beaten, you are\" - which is supposed to inspire our executives to greatness. </p> <p>Then there's the framed copy of the Gettysburg Address. Is the director-general of the Confederation of British Industry an admirer of Abraham Lincoln? Has new Labour's charm offensive turned Centre Point into a secret coven of pinkoes who have been converted to \"government of the people, by the people, for the people\"? </p> <p>Sadly, the truth is a little more prosaic. Military history is Jones's hobby, and he picked up the print when he was visiting American civil war battle sites. </p> <p>Delegates to the CBI's annual conference next week should expect their leader to take somewhat longer to get his point across than Lincoln, who managed to say everything that needed to be said in fewer than 300 words. </p> <p>Jones's big idea is the ungainly sounding \"socially inclusive wealth creation\", which means making Britain an attractive place for mobile global capital to pitch its tents. \"We have got to make sure that the business environment is such that companies want to put down roots and stay here\", he says. \"That way we employ more people in better jobs and with better skills. We employ them in tomorrow's businesses or in today's businesses with tomorrow's technology. We pay more tax, which pays for better schools and hospitals. </p> <p>\"It is not enough to create wealth. We have to step up to the plate and make it socially inclusive.\" </p> <p>Although Jones's credo sounds similar to Tony Blair's third way, the CBI's definition of socially inclusive wealth creation differs somewhat from that of Labour. As far as Jones is concerned, the government does its bit for socially inclusive wealth creation when it makes capital allowances for small and medium sized businesses permanent, when it gives tax breaks for research and development, when it provides learning credits to enhance skills, and when it announces \u00a3180bn of investment in transport over the next 10 years. </p> <p>However, Labour harms the cause of SIWC when it raises taxes on fuel in an attempt to curb pollution or brings in employment regulation to protect workers. As for the idea that Railtrack's abysmal performance might warrant the government taking a stake in running the railways, Jones is blunt. \"Categorically not. The track record of 40 years of nationalisation was nothing to write home about. Governments should do as little as possible. They should facilitate things and get out of the way.\" </p> <p>Full details of the CBI's demands on the political parties will be outlined on Sunday, when it kicks off its conference in Jones's home town of Birmingham by launching its business manifesto. Put simply, this can be boiled down to more money, less red tape and a better transport infrastructure. </p> <p>\"We believe that the chancellor can free up \u00a33bn a year without having inflationary effects on the economy. All of it should come to business, which is paying an extra \u00a35bn a year in tax.\" </p> <p>Of the \u00a33bn, Jones says that half should be spent on meeting the demands of road hauliers - either through reducing vehicle excise duty or by reducing the cost of fuel. The rest should be spent on other business friendly measures, such as watering down the climate change levy. </p> <p>According to Jones, business needs help at a time when the strong pound is making life tough for exporters. \"It's all about competitiveness\", he says. Asked whether this is really the case when half of Britain appears to be under water as a result of global warming, he replies: \"If you can statistically show me that Britain's high fuel prices had meant British cars and trucks had not been used so much I might be prepared to walk down that road.\" </p> <p>He believes that raising fuel and road taxes is pointless until something is done about the public transport system. \"We need to provide a safe, clean, secure, efficient and reliable public transport alternative\", he says. </p> <p><strong> Final demand</strong><br> </p> <p> Following the Hatfield rail crash and the report into the BSE scandal, the CBI's final demand - for less regulation - is likely to run into fierce criticism from the unions, who believe that the way to boost competitiveness is higher productivity not measures to reduce red tape. </p> <p>Jones disagrees. While accepting the case for better health and safety legislation, he says that better doesn't necessarily mean more. He wants regulations which are \"a waste of time and money\" scrapped, and for officialdom to show rather less zeal in policing directives from Brussels - one area where he says the UK acts like exemplary Europeans. </p> <p>But Europe is not Jones's real concern. He kicked the issue of monetary union into the long grass shortly after arriving at the CBI last year, and there it will stay until the government clarifies its position. No, what worries the CBI is that Labour's idea of government \"by the people and for the people\" in the run up to the election will mean the unions calling the shots. </p> <p>\"In the UK we have labour market flexibility which is the envy of the world, but business has been swamped by 16 pieces of employment legislation in two years. This is legislation attuned to helping those already in work rather than those who are out of it. We are saying to the government: no more legislation.\"</p>",
  "<p>Arsenal will not be punished by Uefa when they field a weakened team in their final Champions League Group B game in Ukraine next Tuesday after a pact between Ars\u00e8ne Wenger and Lazio's Sven-Goran Eriksson, the new England coach. </p> <p>The two managers have agreed to rest key players, with Arsenal already qualified as certain group winners and the Italian champions also through in guaranteed second place before they visit Shakhtar Donetsk and Sparta Prague respectively. </p> <p>\"I have had a chat with Eriksson,\" said Wenger, \"and we agreed we would both rest some players.\" On the face of it the pact gives Donetsk and Sparta, level on points, an equal chance of claiming third place and with it the Uefa Cup berth available. </p> <p>\"Each team has submitted a squad list of 25 players and it is up to each coach to decide which players he wants to field from this list,\" Uefa said. </p> <p>George Graham says Tottenham are ready to spend their way out of trouble. \"I'm very determined to put things right here,\" said the beleaguered manager, who was on the continent on Wednesday to scout players only a day after Spurs were knocked out of the League Cup by First Division Birmingham. </p> <p>\"We are short of five or six quality players and if we can get them in we will. If the right one becomes available I am sure the money will be found. </p> <p>\"I am tempted to put the kids in but, given the circumstances at the moment, the red-hot atmosphere could kill them and their confidence.\" </p> <p>Fulham are keen to sign Anderlecht's 6ft 7in striker Jan Koller, 27, for a club-record \u00a36m and may try to push through a deal next week if the Belgian side go out of the Champions League. </p> <p>Derby County have signed Taribo West on loan. The 26-year-old Nigeria defender, who joined Milan from Internazionale last December, has agreed a three-month deal and should make his debut at Arsenal a week tomorrow, subject to a work permit. </p> <p>Derby have also obtained the release of Colin Todd from Swindon. He will become the manager Jim Smith's assistant, though effectively the main man, after compensation was agreed with Swindon, who had taken out an injunction to prevent him from leaving. \"He was a genius as a player and is an experienced football man,\" said Smith. </p> <p>Airdrie's manager Steve Archibald, who was locked out along with his players yesterday, said the club would fold unless an agreement could be reached with the provisional liquidator. \"We have an agreement to pay KPMG a certain amount a month and that allows us to operate this club,\" he said. \"They require \u00a340,000 and I'm saying it should be \u00a325,000, not because I want to say \u00a325,000 but we have got a budget here.\" </p> <p>Archibald took control as the preferred bidder in July after Airdrie went into liquidation during February with debts of about \u00a3750,000. Last night fans presented a cheque for \u00a315,000 to KPMG but Archibald, though welcoming it, feels it may be in vain. </p> <p>Spartak Moscow secured a fifth successive premier division title with yesterday's 1-0 home win over Rostselmash Rostov. </p> <p> o You've read the piece, now have your say.

  "<p>I know from my time at Atletico Madrid how a coach can face problems when he arrives in foreign surroundings. But I'm glad to say I don't think Sven-Goran Eriksson will have the slightest problem settling in England. </p> <p>It's a massive bonus for a start that he speaks the language. I arrived in Madrid 12 years ago with virtually no Spanish and getting my message across with a translator was not always ideal. </p> <p>I remember one incident when we played Osasuna and Michael Robinson was giving us problems at the back. I came in at half-time and asked the translator to tell the centre-half he had to start winning more aerial stuff. The guy went off into something that sounded like a song: \"Mister says will you head the ball more often.\" </p> <p>How's something like that going to have any impact? So I looked the centre-half in the face and shouted in stilted Spanish \"La cabeza muy fuerte\", which is basically \"Strong with the head.\" You could see the players jump then. Believe me, they knew what I wanted. </p> <p>Even so I had to hold individual meetings with players, using the translator, to make sure I got through to them. But Eriksson won't have to deal with that. And football is such a global game these days that one of the other problems I faced will barely concern him. </p> <p>When I went to Madrid and Terry Venables went to Barcelona we weren't particularly well known to the Spanish and they weren't too well known to us. The Atletico right-back Tomas had caught my eye at Euro 88 but in general I wasn't certain what the players were capable of. </p> <p>Eriksson on the other hand will know a lot of the English lads and will have come up against some of them. There is more coverage, information and videos of our football than of any other country in the world. I remember a Finland player saying last month: \"Our fans probably know more about the English players than they do about us.\" </p> <p>On top of that Eriksson is fairly familiar to people here. Not many knew about Ars\u00e8ne Wenger when he arrived at Arsenal but that's not the case with this guy. We've seen him in the Champions League over the past couple of seasons. </p> <p>If nothing else the players will know he has a cv as good as anyone's. Footballers are impressionable and Eriksson's reputation will be a massive help to him. He will be respected and I don't think there'll be any resentment in the dressing room. He's about as close to an English coach as you can get. </p> <p>If Giovanni Trapattoni or Marcello Lippi had got the job I could have seen problems, not only with language but maybe from a cultural point of view. As a northern European I don't think Eriksson will have any trouble settling and he'll understand how English players are thinking. </p> <p>In Madrid I came across clashes of football culture. When one of my players went down injured in a five-a-side, straight away I could see it was histrionics. The trainers and masseurs were ready to run to his attention but I just went over, picked him up by the scruff of the neck and said: \"Get playing.\" </p> <p>I can safely say the Swedes I worked with were in tune with the English way. Roland Nilsson and Niclas Alexandersson were not just two of the best professionals I've come across but two of the most popular. Roland was called the Legend by the players at Sheffield Wednesday and Coventry. </p> <p>What struck me about the Swedes was that they were very disciplined and team-oriented. I think Eriksson will be looking for a great team ethic and I don't imagine there will be any problem with people not knowing their role. </p> <p>Having said that, I must admit when I saw Lazio this season I wasn't overly impressed with their team pattern. They were a bunch of very good players but weren't as good a team as Arsenal. Too many players seemed to think all they had to do was shine for 10 minutes. But it may be I caught them on a couple of bad nights. And let's not forget that last season they were good enough to win the scudetto. </p> <p>One certainty is that the timing could hardly be better for a foreign coach. There has been huge disappointment since Euro 96 and I think the Football Association has a good man. The issue for Eriksson is not settling down but proving his quality. And looking at his record I don't expect any problems with that.</p>",
  "<p>Can you transfer stand-up comedy from a noisy club to the hallowed hush of a theatre? Not allowed to drink or smoke in the auditorium, most of the audience watched in envy as Ed Byrne slurped from a bottle of beer and puffed away, never missing the chance to remind us that it was allowed only on stage. OK, it's not essential to be drunk to enjoy a stand-up routine, but where's the clink of glasses, the background chatter, the hazy atmosphere, the heckler who won't shut up? </p> <p>At times, Byrne had to work hard to rouse the audience. We were too comfortable in our seats, too safe with the carpet beneath our shoes. Any questions were generally met with an embarrassed looking-away. Wisely, Byrne saved most of his two-hour set for after the interval, during which everyone could loosen up with a drink. Lanky in a dark, unironed suit, and with the complexion of someone who sees more night than day, Byrne looked like a trainee undertaker, his stiff demeanour relieved only by his long hair and loopy grin. But it's a nervousness that he has successfully worked into his act (along with the heavy smoking). </p> <p>Beginning with a 20-minute slot, Dublin-bred Byrne quipped through topical gags - the bad weather, the environment, the fuel crisis - before moving on to some sure-fire piss-takes: builders, taxi-drivers, dentists, the latter in a very funny skit. </p> <p>But it didn't seem enough, at first, and Ben Norris's rough-and-ready patois livened things up in a half-hour support. Even though his material went for familiar targets - students, daytime television, air hostesses, porn - he played the line between funny and nasty, the late-30s lad who knows better but still enjoys being a bit wicked. </p> <p>Byrne's second appearance, for 90 minutes, saw him get into his stride. Although it's his style to muddle, slur, and interrupt himself - and that's part of his charm - his timing was impeccable. There were hilarious stories of being dumped by his girlfriend, as well as a merciless and very funny trashing of boybands, girlbands, indeed any bands who aren't heavy metal (hence his long hair). </p> <p>A shrewd look at homophobia received laughs of recognition, and Byrne mocked his own puniness to good effect in sending up martial arts, sex appeal (or lack of it), and his passionate aversion to scales: \"I maybe Irish, but I'm not a jockey.\" Despite the lack of alcohol, the audience was soon won over by Byrne's big-laugh blend of Irish coyness and eye-bulging, honest-bloke wit. And it's more than fair play to him for that.</p>"
