  "<p>A few hours earlier, up-and-coming Sona Fariq were scheduled to support horrible metal shouters Pitchshifter when fate dealt them a cruel blow. Pitchshifter's singer lost his voice (I can't imagine why) and the show was cancelled. Many artists would have welcomed a night off in the pub. Not Sona Fariq. They phoned round, pulled in fellow support the Workhorse Movement and put on their own gig. </p> <p>Two Asian skinheads (drummer Wasif Hussein and bassist Abrar Hafiz), an Anglo-French guitarist (Dom Bouffard) and shaven-headed Moroccan singing sensation Michael Frankl, Sona Fariq deliver life in the modern UK with almost unrivalled spirit. Two songs in, Frankl wades into the crowd to deliver a song, jumping up and down within the m l\u00e9e. Wild-eyed, he appears to take the sight of somebody unimpressed as a personal insult. </p> <p>Bewilderingly lumped in with Nu Metal, which obviously irritates the singer (he talks of \"minds numbed by testosterone\"), Sona Fariq are metal-ish but multi-faceted. Their global palette mixes punk, glam, hip-hop and reggae and, while nowhere near fully developed, could emerge as a fusion of, say, the Stooges and Audioweb. </p> <p>Frankl's stirring, vulnerable vocals are close to those of the late, great Malcolm Owen of the Ruts (he should hear their LP The Crack for lessons in how to use his voice.) Still, the Nu Metal kids seem happy. \"Destroy!\" shouts someone in a dog collar. </p> <p>Frankl ends by asking half the audience on stage; then he sings the final number while getting a piggy back from somebody on the dance floor. He then instructs everyone off the stage (they obey) and stands, still singing, as people queue to shake his hand.</p>",
  "<p>While argument over who should run the National Lottery threatens to head back to the courts, risking a hiatus in distribution of \"good cause\" funds, MPs are being urged to review how such funds are distributed in the first place. </p> <p>In a submission today to the Commons culture select committee, the National Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO) says the distribution system should stand alone and distinct from government. The Labour administration's directions to the new opportunites fund represent \"meddling\" and \"a potentially dangerous erosion of the principle of additionality\". </p> <p>Under this principle, lottery cash is supposed only to fund projects additional to those underwritten by normal public spending. Critics claim this rule has been breached in the way ministers have directed the fund to spend \u00a32.3bn on specific causes within the broad themes of health, education and the environment. </p> <p>In its support, the NCVO is citing findings of an ICM opinion survey it commissioned. These suggest that only 12% of people think the government should have a say in deciding where lottery money is spent, as against 72% who feel there should be a role for an independent, publicly appointed body. </p> <p>Asked to choose just one body to determine lottery spending, only 10% of people opt for government, 62% for an independent body, 16% for local councils, 9% for the lottery operator and 3% have no view. </p> <p>Stuart Etherington, NCVO chief executive, says he wants \"cast iron assurances\" that the government remains committed to additionality and is prepared to review decision-making processes in respect of the new opportunities fund. </p> <p>The NCVO will also press for reassurance that there will be no hiatus in distribution of good cause money.</p>",
  "<p>Britain's largest companies are channelling more funds to voluntary and community organisations than ever before. Last year, some \u00a3310m was handed out by the 100 or so highest corporate donors, as against \u00a3275m the year before. However, the nature of their giving has changed strikingly, with a big shift from cash gifts to investment in cash and kind. </p> <p>Take BT. Its \u00a315m a year programme makes it one of the most consistent big givers. Yet charitable donations now account for less than 10% of its community budget, despite little change in the way the company distributes its money among education and employment projects, arts, environment and voluntary sector partnerships. Although the latter receives some \u00a34m a year, the majority of that cash is not a donation. </p> <p>Peter Thompson, BT's community operations manager, says: \"The company has changed the way it accounts for its community spend and only money that supports staff giving, or time, through matched give-as-you-earn and staff awards is now classified as charitable donations.\" In other words the company expects a return on its \"investment\" in charity. </p> <p>Scottish Power, the utility group which includes Manweb and Southern Water, contributed \u00a36.1m to the community last year, of which just \u00a3600,000 was awarded to charities. Even its PowerPartners initiative, designed to raise \u00a32m for six charities, including the Royal National Institute for the Blind, the Royal National Institute for Deaf People and Disability Scotland and Wales, is part community investment because it also engages the charities in helping improve the utility's services for special needs customers. </p> <p>According to Paul Pagliari, Scottish Power human resources director, nobody is suggesting that the company should award these funds purely for altruistic reasons. \"It is also a win-win situation for us as a business and reflects the strong links which we seek to establish with the communities in which we operate,\" he says. </p> <p>The figures for company giving come from the annual survey by Corporate Citizen magazine. The totals include donations to charity, gifts of old equipment or furniture and a value attributed to the work time which employees spend volunteering or fundraising. Money or goods donated to non-charitable local causes, such as schools or economic development bodies, are also included. </p> <p>Two of last year's top corporate donors, Lloyds TSB and Northern Rock, give for neither altruistic nor business reasons, however. Under terms dating back to when the Trustee Savings Bank became a plc, and updated when it merged with Lloyds, the four Lloyds TSB foundations are shareholders in the company and receive 1% of the group's pre-tax profits, averaged over three years, instead of a dividend on their shareholding. Last year, this amounted to a \"donation\" of \u00a326.5m. </p> <p>Similarly, when Northern Rock converted from a mutual to a bank in 1997, a foundation was established to receive 5% of the company's pre-tax profits - close on \u00a310m in 1999. It is arguable whether both privatisations could have gone ahead without such arrangements. </p> <p>The upward trend in corporate giving is in many ways a reflection of better calculation, rather than a sudden attack of generosity. Scottish Power is one of a number of companies using more sophisticated methods to measure community investment. Five years ago, the only way corporate citizen could gauge the sector's community support was to add together the charitable donations in companies' annual reports. Now, more than 50 top givers put a figure on their much larger community contributions. </p> <p> The headline increase also masks a decrease by some of the leaders in the field. British Airways has cut its community budget following a nose-dive in profits. Yet despite the reduction, its \u00a35.7m worldwide community budget outstripped the airline's pre-tax profits for 1999-2000. The reason for this anomaly is that the community budget was set the previous year when profits were far healthier. </p> <p>Luc Vandevelde, chairman of Marks &amp; Spencer, told a packed shareholders' meeting in July that the flagging company was reducing the \u00a314.1m it contributes to good causes. Last year its donations fell by a quarter. For 2000, the company has a \u00a37.3m budget - a 48% drop. \"We can't maintain current spend if profits are much less, but what is important is that we are committed to investing more than 1% of pre-tax profits in the community,\" says Leris Harefield, M&amp;S community involvement spokeswoman. </p> <p>It is not just falling profits that jeopardise fragile community budgets. NatWest's \u00a315.4m community spend is up in the air following its takeover by the Royal Bank of Scotland. And United Biscuits (UB), now owned by Final Realm, has halved its contributions to \u00a3750,000 and slashed charitable donations by more than 80% to just \u00a3125,000. </p> <p>For the record, UB denies that the buyout or the departure of its chief executive, Eric Nicoli, have any thing to do with its decision to ditch a commitment to contribute 1% of pre-tax profits to the community. But the fact that Nicoli, now at EMI, continues to chair the PerCent Club - a 200 strong group of companies promoting this 1% benchmark - would suggest otherwise. </p> <p>According to Alan Coutes, UB's director of community affairs, the company has pared down those areas where it sees no direct business benefit from its spend. Its new focus, like a number of companies, puts the onus on employees to donate to charity. In business speak, this approach \"empowers\" staff to raise money, or volunteer, for the cause they support and in turn feel motivated about the company they work for. </p> <p>Given such volatility of company giving, charities should not lose a proper perspective on its relative importance. In 1999, according to the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, the corporate sector provided just 4.5% of voluntary sector income. </p> <p>\u0095 Alison Benjamin is editor of Corporate Citizen magazine, published by the Directory of Social Change.

  "<p>The two largest HIV charities, London Lighthouse and Terrence Higgins Trust, are on honeymoon this week. They married on Sunday and will now be known as Terrence Higgins Trust Lighthouse. The merger is one of the biggest seen in the voluntary sector and creates an organisation with an annual turnover of at least \u00a38m. </p> <p>The chief executive of the new charity will be Nick Partridge, who used to head the trust. He heralds the merger as \"a turning point for HIV services in the UK and for the charity sector\". He knows he risks being accused of empire building, having already merged with a handful of smaller HIV charities, but insists it is not an enforced marriage - as does London Lighthouse, despite its well publicised financial troubles of recent years. </p> <p>The merger idea came up in a discussion between two senior managers from the charities, both of whom happened to be HIV positive. One of them, Paul Ward, formerly deputy chief executive of the trust, says: \"The issue of service provision is very close to our hearts and we wanted to find the best way to continue, faced with funding cuts and a changing environment.\" </p> <p>The number of people in Britain living with HIV is set to increase 50% over the next five years. Combination therapy means that such people are living longer and their needs are changing. At the same time, health authority funding is being cut and fundraising is proving difficult. One survey ranked Aids charities last in a popularity table of 24 charity groupings. </p> <p>As Ward says: \"HIV/Aids is not seen as a sexy cause and we need to use our scarce resources more efficiently.\" </p> <p>As well as improving efficiency, Partridge says, \"the merger of the UK's two largest and highest profile HIV organisations will give a powerful, national voice to people living with HIV\". </p> <p>However, concerns are being expressed about a loss of diversity within the sector. Rosalind Collin, director of Jewish Aids Trust, insists her charity must remain independent - even though it is fighting for funds. \"If we were to merge, our clients would stop using the services. Jewish people wouldn't want to receive education from a mainstream organisation that might not understand our culture.\" </p> <p>Ward counters: \"I don't buy the argument about depletion of choice. Surely it is better for organisations to come together and maintain services, than to close for lack of funding - that is a depletion of choice.\" </p> <p>The merger has also caused anxiety about jobs. Fears of widescale redundancy were allayed only last Thursday at a joint meeting between the organisations. Five positions have been made redundant but three new posts have been created. To cut costs, positions made vacant by people leaving of their own volition have also been deleted from the payroll. The merged organisation expects to save \u00a3500,000 in infrastructure costs. </p> <p>The merger process has taken six months to work through, with both charities conducting due diligence checks and setting out heads of agreement. They have also commissioned market research to ascertain the reactions of major donors, including celebrities, businesses and trusts. </p> <p>Ward says: \"We are going to be prudent financially, but we hope that by combining the two best known brands in the HIV sector we will continue to attract donations.\" </p> <p>Both charities previously received 50% of their income through voluntary donations. </p> <p>Gary Alessio, director of the pan-London HIV providers' consortium, says: \"With so much competition for funds it is good to see two major charities taking this initiative. However, there is a danger in providers going full steam ahead and merging. There needs to be a more strategic approach in London to shape the service provision of the future.\" </p> <p>The impact of such a large-scale merger may well spread beyond the London HIV sector. Indeed, the National Council for Voluntary Organisations has predicted a growth of mergers in the voluntary sector in the next five years. </p> <p>Andrew Passey, head of research, says that this high-profile example may put increased pressure on other charitable organisations to merge \"given the public's perception of there being too many charities and too much competition\".</p>",
  "<p> My birthday only comes once a year. And what a great party! </p> <p> But Jack Straw gives the criminals a party every day while victims wait outside in the cold. </p> <p> His greetings telegram to the criminal is: 'don't worry, there are nearly 3,000 fewer police to catch you, and even if you are unlucky enough to be caught, I'll let you out of jail in record time.' </p> <p> In The Wizard of Oz, the Man of Straw had no brain. I can show you one with no heart and no courage as well. </p> <p> He and his friend Tony promised to be 'tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime'. All they've been tough on is the dwindling number of people trying to fight crime. Last year, I warned that the thin blue line was getting thinner. Now it's becoming a row of dots, which nobody wants to join. </p> <p> High on promises, low on action. Long on spin, short on truth. Drunk on power, incapable of delivery. </p> <p> It's not that they're short on rhetoric when it comes to victims. Remember what Tony Blair said in his speech last week? </p> <p> Tony Blair said that one of the big projects for the second term of a Labour government - and I quote - would be 'standing up for victims'. </p> <p> Why is he waiting for a second term? It's not as if he's going to get one. </p> <p> What a sense of priorities. They've spent the first term getting prisoners out of jail early, cutting the police force, multiplying red tape, and dreaming of drunks at cashpoints. The victim has to wait for the second term. </p> <p> By contrast, my first pledge as shadow home secretary, the very first policy I announced, was new rights for victims enshrined in law. </p> <p> That shows where this party's priorities lie. What about the rest of Jack Straw's record at the Home Office? </p> <p> Police numbers down, crime up, violent crime soaring, the asylum system in chaos, spies laughing at the country they betrayed\u0085 </p> <p> When we were debating rising crime under this Government, I asked Jack Straw whether crime would fall again. He said: 'That depends on the criminals.' </p> <p> I thought it was traditional for the British people to rely on their government to cut crime, not on the criminals. It cannot be common sense to fight crime with fewer crimefighters. It cannot be common sense, when the police have spent time and effort arresting people, to see the criminal back on the street before the police officer. It cannot be common sense to let prisoners sit around in idleness. It cannot be common sense to allow persistent young menaces to grow up with the belief that they are untouchable at law. It cannot be common sense to arrest the householder instead of the burglar. </p> <p> We need common sense. </p> <p> This country needs a well-motivated, strong police force that can protect everyone, regardless of race, colour or creed. But when the police have done their job, the public must be protected by proper, effective sentencing. </p> <p> When those sentences include custody, protecting the public doesn't end at the prison gate. It means work and education inside prisons to give inmates the skills to lead a law-abiding life outside. </p> <p> You are already aware that we have promised to restore police numbers. But numbers alone are not the only answer. We must make sure that every single policeman makes the most effective use of every minute of his time. Yet officers regularly tell me that they can spend an entire shift processing a single criminal through custody, and that they have to fill in the same information on form after form. Indeed, from what they tell me I can only conclude that the police have got more form than the criminals they arrest. For too long, politicians have observed this and done nothing. It is time to relieve the police of this crippling burden. </p> <p> It is plain common sense that a policeman should come into the station, deliver his prisoner with a short statement and go straight back onto the beat to arrest more criminals. And that's what's going to happen on my watch. And if that means taking a large part of the custody function away from the police, that's what I'll do. </p> <p> So we're going to restore the numbers. And we're going to make sure they spend their time more effectively. And we're going to make sure that they spend their time in the rural areas as well as the urban. </p> <p> Many rural people feel isolated from the forces of law and order. They rarely see their local bobby. Where there is an emergency, they wait far too long for a response. </p> <p> For those who live in sparsely populated areas, this is a real, live problem. So I've been looking for real, live solutions. I believe that there are lots of ways that we can get visible policing in our countryside. Through retained police officers, part-time police officers, specials, greater use of retired officers, and through 'cops in shops'. </p> <p> Cops in shops is a very simple initiative, which I saw in Washington. The officer doesn't go back to the station to write up his reports, he writes them up in shops and other public places. This has a threefold advantage. First of all, he's visible. Secondly, he can interact with the community. And thirdly, he is a deterrent. </p> <p> One of the reasons why we have such problems in recruiting is that very often, young people lose interest between the time they leave school and the time they are old enough to join the police. So I want to re-introduce a police cadet force which will not only provide a recruiting and training ground for both the regular police and the specials, but will fundamentally change young people's attitude towards the police at a time in their lives when it is most important. </p> <p> Instead of being tough on criminals, Tony Blair and Jack Straw operate a revolving door prisons policy. </p> <p> On Jack Straw's own tagging scheme, criminals sentenced to six months get out of jail in six weeks - even John Prescott gets through more of his sentences. </p> <p> And so 23,000 convicts have been let out early. </p> <p> Including 200 convicted killers </p> <p> Thousands of other violent criminals. </p> <p> Nearly 150 convicted of assaulting police. </p> <p> More than 900 robbers </p> <p> Over 2,100 burglars </p> <p> 3,000 drug dealers </p> <p> And when, but for Jack Straw's measure, they should have been in jail, these criminals have committed even more crimes - over 700 more. </p> <p> Dozens of burglaries and thefts </p> <p> Threats to kill </p> <p> Drug dealing </p> <p> Even two rapes </p> <p> The next Conservative government will scrap this tagging scheme, this mammoth insult to victims. </p> <p> I'm against early release in all but one case. There is only one early release that I will be prepared to see in the public interest. That's Jack Straw's early release from the chains of office - and Tony Blair and the rest of the Labour party with him. </p> <p> And instead, we will introduce honesty in sentencing. With the complete abolition of automatic early release. </p> <p> Sentences will say what they mean and mean what they say. </p> <p> Discounts will have to be earned and will not be substantial - unlike now. </p> <p> Where a custodial sentence is passed, we will ensure that there is a programme of rehabilitation in place. Too many offenders who are sent to prison go on to re-offend. </p> <p> By ensuring that they have an alternative to a continuation of their life of crime, we can better protect the public. </p> <p> Idle prisons are breeding grounds for the disease of crime. We will move towards a full working day in all prisons, based on self-financing workshops that take on real work which real employers want in the real world. Prisoners' wages will go towards the cost of their upkeep, the support of their families, savings to give them a start when they leave prison, and reparations to the victims of crime. </p> <p> It is all about protecting the public. </p> <p> And we've got to start with the young criminals. We will take the young menaces off the streets, away from the environment that has failed them, and give them a real chance to change. Last year I set out proposals to do this, placing them in secure training and giving them a stable regime and a real chance to change. This year, I want to look beyond young criminals, at the single biggest cause of crime, particularly but not exclusively amongst the young. </p> <p> The single biggest cause of crime in this country today is drugs. </p> <p> Children are 20% of our population but they are 100% of our future. Drugs are the cancer that is eating away at our country and threatening those children and that future. </p> <p> It's not our children who are the only victims. Crime costs this country \u00a350bn a year - and at least a third of all crimes are drug related. Eighty per cent of burglaries are motivated by drugs. </p> <p> One third of acquisitive crime is drug-related, costing victims over \u00a32bn a year. </p> <p> More than 100,000 people are convicted or cautioned for drug offences every year. </p> <p> Even if they end up in court, many get a conditional discharge or a small fine. </p> <p> Not exactly tough. </p> <p> What do the other parties offer? </p> <p> The Liberal Democrats toy with legalisation. And they want to end the tough mandatory sentences for drug dealers. </p> <p> In other words, give in. What they want to do is against all common sense. </p> <p> Labour promised a war against drugs. </p> <p> What have they done with the drug dealers? Given them the get out of jail free card. </p> <p> 23,000 criminals let out on special early release scheme, and more than 3,000 have been drug dealers or traffickers. </p> <p> Drug dealers who on average got 22 months' jail. </p> <p> Under Labour they served nine months. </p> <p> So what will we do? </p> <p> We have already pledged tougher sentences for drug dealers who sell to our children and a crackdown on drugs in and around our schools. And, needless to say, we will scrap the get out of jail free card for 3,000 drug dealers. </p> <p> Today I am able to announce a new policy. Earlier this year, I visited New York, where under Mayor Giuliani crime has plummeted. Although we can't replicate exactly what I saw there, we can learn the lessons of tackling crime head on and not conceding a centimetre to the criminals. So today, I can announce a new policy. A policy that means no quarter for those whose trade is dealing in human misery, despair and even death. </p> <p> And so, from the possession of the most minimal amount of soft drugs right up the chain to the large importer, there will be no hiding place. There will be zero tolerance. </p> <p> Parents want it. Schools need it. Our future demands it. The next Conservative government will do it. </p> <p> What does it mean? It means zero tolerance of possession. No more getting away with just a caution, no more hoping that a blind eye will be turned. If someone possesses drugs, the minimum for a first offence will be a fixed penalty of \u00a3100. But not for a second offence. Then it's into court. </p> <p> And no more claiming that no matter what amount you've got on you, it's for personal use. Over and above the smallest amount, the charge will be substantial possession, and the penalties applicable will be of a range comparable to those for dealing. </p> <p> And as for the suppliers, we will put them out of business. </p> <p> We will dedicate police resources and police officers to identifying and cleaning up forever those houses and other places where regular supply takes place. And the replacement suppliers, and their replacements, and their replacements, until there are no more replacements. </p> <p> Yes, this will require extra money, yes this will require extra police officers, and yes they will be forthcoming. That will be money well spent. </p> <p> And there are other aspects of our drugs laws which we need to change. Why do you lose your licence for drink-driving, but not for drugs driving? In future, anybody caught driving with illegal substances in their bloodstream will be subject to a mandatory ban. Why should it be that you have illegal drugs in your pocket, you're guilty of possession, but when they're in your bloodstream, you're guilty of nothing? </p> <p> Why do we have laws against opium dens which don't apply to crack houses? </p> <p> Zero tolerance of the biggest scourge in our society today. That's what's going to happen on my watch. </p> <p> Other things will change also. Our asylum system will be completely overhauled and we will automatically house all new applicants in secure reception centres. It's extraordinary, but Labour call that racist. Yet the biggest loser in their system is the genuine refugee who comes to this country with not only a legal but a moral case for a safe haven, and finds himself clogged up in queue which has hit more than 100,000 cases - double what Labour inherited. If the message goes out to those who simply seek to play our system that in future they will be detained, dealt with speedily and removed, they will cease to come and we will be able to process the genuine applicant more quickly. However, for the real refugee, reception centres will provide a one-stop point of expertise in education for the children, language support, and social services support. </p> <p> At the moment such people, with all their vulnerability and needs are turned out to take their chance in areas where the local authorities have no experience in coping and where the provision of such services is a hit and miss affair. </p> <p> Let me make clear to Tony Blair what I believe - what is my 'irreducible core'. </p> <p> If you're asking me to stand by and see the genuine refugee stuck in a queue with tens of thousands of other applications; </p> <p> If you're asking me to tolerate a situation where that man waits months or years for a decision on his case while Ministers dither and officials shuffle paper; </p> <p> If you're asking me to put up with a shambolic system of support which is letting down both the refugees and the local councils and the local people who have to pick up the pieces, then vote for the other man, because I won't do it. </p> <p> Letting down genuine refugees. I don't think I could do that. Could you? </p> <p> Releasing 23,000 prisoners extra-early. I don't think I could do that. Could you? </p> <p> Cut police numbers when crime is rising. I don't think I could that. Could you? </p> <p> Surrender to the drugs menace. We couldn't do that. We shouldn't do that. </p> <p> We won't do that.</p>",

  "<p>There will be bureaucrats within the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund counting down the days to the end of the year when Jubilee 2000, the coalition calling for the forgiveness of third world debt, finally shuts up shop. </p> <p>The UK-based lobby group has harried the two international financial institutions for more than five years to give the world's indebted countries a break. Human chains around World Bank and IMF meetings and the support of high-profile figures like Bono and the Pope has taken debt from being an obscure backroom issue to front page news. On Monday the lead singer of the band U2 met Bill Clinton at the White House and with religious leaders and senators urged the US to forgive its share of third world debts. </p> <p>The campaign has achieved some breakthroughs: last year the Group of Seven leading industrialised countries agreed that the existing plan for managing third world debt was slow and inadequate. They promised deeper, speedier debt relief at their Cologne summit in June last year. </p> <p>But in less than 100 days, the main focus of the debt campaign will shut up shop. Jubilee 2000 has no plans to become Jubilee 2001, even though its leading lights admit their campaign objective of achieving the cancellation of unpayable third world debt is far from won. </p> <p>There were some crumbs of comfort yesterday for campaigners disappointed by the lack of progress on debt forgiveness at last week's meetings of the World Bank and IMF. </p> <p>Britain has found a further \u00a3100m of third world debt to write off, buried in the books of the Commonwealth Development Corporation, the state-owned development financing body which Labour plans to privatise. </p> <p>The CDC debt is small beer, however, in comparison to what remains to be done on debt more than a year after the G7's pledge. The bank and the IMF claimed they had made progress in Prague: they have agreed to bend the strict conditions poor countries have to meet to qualify for the west's loans reduction package, to help get 20 countries on to the programme by the end of the year. </p> <p>But even if the two bodies manage to fast-track 10 more countries over the next three months, the original pledge was to get 24, not 20 countries into the programme. And campaigners argue that the G7's debt deal is too limited: headline promises of 100% debt cancellation apply only to debts owed to individual western countries. The bulk of the debts are owed to the World Bank and the IMF and will be cut rather than written off, leaving many countries still paying more in servicing debt than they do on health and primary education. </p> <p><strong> Cracks appear</strong><br> Privately, insiders in the bank admit the holes in the present debt deal are beginning to appear. Crashing commodity prices and the rising cost of oil is hitting the indebted countries of sub-saharan Africa the hardest, undermining the two financial institutions' estimates of what is sustainable debt. </p> <p>The IMF's figures show that some countries will be paying more on debt servicing after the G7 debt deal than before. But the bureaucrats argue that it took so long to mobilise support for the current deal even if it is flawed that going back to the drawing board is out of the question. </p> <p>As the deadline set by the G7 looms larger, so does Jubilee 2000's self-imposed deadline. The time limit on the call helped to give Jubilee's campaign its edge, however, the down side is that the coalition cannot extend its mandate to a further round of campaigning without losing its credibility. The debt campaign's leaders - representatives from the faith groups and aid agencies which fund the umbrella body - are determined to stick with the original deadline despite opposition from within the coalition. \"You can't turn a sprint into a marathon,\" says Adrian Lovett, Jubilee 2000's deputy director. </p> <p>But developing country campaigners feel they are being abandoned by their northern partners with the job not even half done. The response from the coalition is that campaigning on debt will not end with Jubilee: the members will keep the campaign going. </p> <p>\"The World Bank, the IMF and the G7 would be making a big mistake if they are banking on the pressure disappearing after Jubilee 2000 shuts down,\" says Justin Forsyth, head of policy at Oxfam, one of the coalition members. Unluckily for the G7, the venue for their meeting next year is Genoa. The Italian debt campaign is well organised and has papal backing, and unlike this year's G7 meeting in Okinawa, it is within striking distance for Jubilee's committed supporters. </p> <p>The question now is who will rally them. The aid agencies want to move on from debt, which they argue was just a symptom of the problems facing poor countries in the global economic system rather than a cause of poverty. They will continue to work on debt issues, but without the name of Jubilee, keeping supporters in touch and organised will be more difficult. </p> <p>But it would be unwise for the World Bank and IMF staff to celebrate too soon. Jubilee 2000 may be about to fold up its tents but the heirs to grassroots opposition it rallied will be carrying on the fight.</p>",
  "James Dyson, inventor of the bagless vacuum cleaner, yesterday scored a landmark victory at the high court over his arch rival Hoover, which was ruled to have copied his best dust-busting machine. <p>Mr Dyson, a serial inventor who first came to prominence in 1974 with his Ballbarrow - an \"easy to steer\" wheelbarrow - is hoping to win millions of pounds in damages and prevent further Hoover sales of bagless equipment at a final hearing on October 13. </p> <p>Hoover had argued that Dyson's technology involved nothing that was not already known inside the industry. But deputy high court judge Michael Fysh QC ruled that Hoover had infringed the patent and dimissed a counterclaim for its revocation. </p> <p>Hoover said it would appeal in the case, dubbed \"floor wars\", and has warned that hundreds of jobs at its Scottish production plant could be at risk if it failed. </p> <p>Mr Dyson, 53, who was used to fighting the sceptics and reluctant financial backers in the early years, said the case was important for his 1,900 workers at Dyson Appliances in Malmesbury, Wiltshire. He saw it as a landmark victory for individual inventors and smaller businesses. </p> <p><b> 'False claims'</b><br> </p> <p>\"I spent 20 years developing this technology and I am very pleased to see Hoover, who made a lot of false claims about their product, can't just rip off our designs and copy us,\" he said. </p> <p>It is wrong for companies to be able to come in and copy other people's inventions, added Mr Dyson: \"This case shows that this can be stopped.\" </p> <p>The former interior designer, now feted by government, is not out of the woods yet. Alberto Bertali, managing director of Hoover UK, said its triple vortex cleaner had been a big success with customers and he would battle to the end to keep it on the shelves. </p> <p>\"We believe we were right to fight this case and presented what we thought was compelling evidence of technological and scientific differences [with Dyson's equipment].\" </p> <p>The case against Hoover involved infringement of Dyson's dual cyclone cleaner which uses centrifugal force to separate dirt from air. Hoover's triple vortex machine also dispensed with the traditional vacuum bag. </p> <p>Prior to Dyson all vacuum cleaners worked on the principle that dirt was sucked up and separated by passing a stream of dirty air through a bag or a filter. </p> <p>Mr Dyson made the first breakthrough in vacuum cleaner technology in 1979 and it was the first real change since Hoover pioneered a basic technique in 1908. He has spent the intervening years fighting off patent threats all over Europe but getting his revolutionary system off the ground was tough. </p> <p>He hawked his new design around many of the big manufacturers, including Electrolux, Phillips and Black &amp; Decker but none was interested in moving away from vacuum cleaners without bags. </p> <p>Eventually, he borrowed \u00a3600,000 and set up his own company. </p> <p>In the first year, Dyson's bagless cleaner clocked up sales of \u00a32.4m. This rose to \u00a310m the following year and by February 1995 the Dyson equipment had become the largest-selling cleaner in Britain. Now Dyson Appliances is selling nearly \u00a3300m worth of machines a year and claims to hold half of the British market by volume. </p> <p>By contrast, Hoover, once the global giant of the vacuum world, has seen its market share dwindle to an estimated 10% following a series of gaffes, culminating in a disastrous marketing campaign in 1992. </p> <p>Customers were offered free flights for every \u00a3100 spent on Hoover products. The open-ended offer attracted 600,000 people with the final cost - estimated at \u00a350m - to Hoover's US owner Maytag which immediately sold off Hoover to its current Italian owner, Candy. </p> <p>Mr Dyson likes to present himself as a plucky British underdog who has battled and won against the massive odds of multinational corporations. </p> <p>But he is one of the top 50 richest people in this country - with an estimated personal fortune of \u00a3500m - and has recently started doing some of his manufacturing in Malaysia in an attempt to reduce costs and counter the impact of a high pound. </p> <p><b> Self-made</b><br> </p> <p>Such a self-made industrialist should be a natural ally of the Conservative party but he is an ardent Europhile and has warned that failure to join the euro could encourage him to move more production overseas. </p> <p>But he is no huge fan of the current government either, despite the fact that he lists Number 10 (along with Buckingham Palace and Elton John's house) as places where you will find his equipment. </p> <p>He said recently: \"In Britain there is more interest in making sure there are lots of dot.com millionaires and no interest in nurturing and caring about manufacturing.\" </p> <p>Dyson's personal life revolves between his millhouse and headquarters in Wiltshire, a Queen Anne townhouse in Chelsea and a holiday farmhouse in Provence. </p> <p>Born to academic parents in north Norfolk, Mr Dyson was educated at Gresham's School in Holt before going on to become a student of interior design at the Royal College of Art. </p> <p>Design is a passion he shares with his wife, Deirdre, who he met when they studied together earlier in his student career at Byam Shaw art school.</p>",
  "<p>In a far-reaching move which promises to lead to cheaper and faster internet access, the European Union yesterday agreed that the last mile of telephone lines into people's homes should be opened up to competition in January. </p> <p>Telecoms ministers meeting in Luxembourg reached agreement on a European commission proposal to unbundle the local loop in a deal that is likely to be approved by the European parliament later this month. </p> <p>The agreement was signed as the controversy continued surrounding the break-up of BT's local network. </p> <p>Cable &amp; Wireless said it had joined the chorus of rivals making a formal complaint against BT in the row over access to the company's local exchanges. </p> <p>Mike McTighe, chief executive of C&amp;W's global division, said the company had made its feelings known to the industry regulator, Oftel. </p> <p>\"The local exchanges they're making available are the ones that are least attractive from a commercial perspective. </p> <p>\"They've produced this wonderful blacklist of exchanges that are 'full'. Well, surprise, surprise, the exchanges that are full are more likely to be exchanges that are most likely to be commercially viable. </p> <p>\"While they've been prevaricating they've been able to deploy their own DSL [digital] equipment and take the space in those exchanges. So how fair does that sound? Is that a level playing field?\" </p> <p>Under the proposal the EU's 15 member states have to scrap remaining monopolies on phone lines into people's homes and offices. This will enable hi-tech firms to compete to install digital technology capable of squeezing even television pictures down the line. </p> <p>\"We have completed liberalisation of the sector,\" said Erkki Liikanen, the commissioner for the industry. \"We had done that with international and long distance calls but not with local. This last step is of growing importance because of the internet.\" </p> <p>Patricia Hewitt, the DTI minister for e-commerce, said after yesterday's meeting: \"It is an enormously important issue for the development of e-commerce across the EU.\" </p> <p>The agreement is expected to be a big boost for industry and the internet, and crucial in helping Europe catch up with the online revolution in the US and Asia. </p> <p>Telecoms liberalisation was a key feature of the Lisbon economic summit last March, in which Britain and the commission played a leading role. </p> <p>British officials made much of promising cheaper, better and faster net access, and yesterday hotly denied suggestions that they had attempted to delay the agreement. </p> <p>Only Germany and Denmark among EU members have open local loops, while France, Ireland and Belgium are some way behind the proposed liberalisation schedule. </p> <p>In Britain, Oftel is aiming to allow BT competitors to offer services on its local loop from July 2001, six months after the EU's target. </p> <p>\"Unbundling\" means identifying individual lines from the thick groups of wire inside a telephone exchange. </p> <p>The EU regulation goes further than some national unbundling already undertaken by requiring full access to the local loop for entrants as well as shared access - where the incumbent would continue to provide voice services but a new entrant would provide internet access through the same copper wire.</p>",
  "<p>That HSBC is being courted heavily by US banking group Merrill Lynch is becoming part of City folklore. </p> <p>Scared by the might of the Citigroup conglomerate, which includes Salomon Smith Barney, many believe the \"thundering herd\" that is Merrill Lynch would feel much more comfortable if it could team up with HSBC. The speculation started as a result of the joint venture established by the two groups at a cost of \u00a3300m a year to provide banking and investment services over the internet to the \"mass affluent\". </p> <p>But, there appears little reason for HSBC's management team to bow to Merrill Lynch's rumoured advances. At three times the size of Merrill, it is HSBC which would have to take the lead. </p> <p>At their annual board meeting today in Kuala Lumpur John Bond and his HSBC team are unlikely to be considering ways to woo the staff of Merrill, who own as much as 40% of their bank. He will be able to remind his board that HSBC is one of the banks which can truly claim to be global. In the US, HSBC's hexagon is a familiar sight on the streets of New York after its acquisition of the Safra banking empire. The hexagon is now accepted on the streets in Britain after replacing the tired Griffin of the renamed Midland Bank. It will gain credibility in France after the acquisition of CCF. </p> <p>The City seems content with HSBC's progress. Its shares have galloped upwards in recent months and their power yesterday was much of the reason for the FTSE's gains. </p> <p>The biggest problem for investors is deciding whether it is too late to join in the ride at \u00a39.80. Perhaps so, says Richard Coleman, banking analyst at ABN Amro. But HSBC is also one of the few British banks on his recommended buy list. </p> <p>Hated during the Asian crisis three years ago, HSBC has convinced investors it has diversified from emerging markets. The shares look as if they should be held and bought gently on dips.</p>",
  "<p>British companies are spearheading a global mergers and acquisitions boom, investing more abroad last year than any other country, new figures showed yesterday. </p> <p>Britain accounted for $199.3bn (\u00a3138bn) of cross border investment, replacing the United States as the largest outward investor for the first time since 1988. </p> <p>The huge deals which helped to push Britain to the top of the list included Vodafone's $60bn purchase of AirTouch and BP's $48bn takeover of US oil company Amoco, according to figures, compiled by the United Nations conference on trade and development (Unctad). </p> <p>A wave of M&amp;A activity drove total cross-border investment flows to a record high of $800bn (\u00a3545bn) in 1999, an increase of 16% on 1998. </p> <p>Britain and the US were also the principal host countries for so-called foreign di rect investment, often from each other's companies </p> <p>America attracted a record $276bn last year. Britain brought in $82.2bn of investment, also a record, which confirms that failure to join European monetary union has not reduced the country's popularity with foreign investors. </p> <p>Britain's nearest rival in the EU was Sweden followed by France and the Netherlands. </p> <p>Unctad said cross border M&amp;A activity, including the purchase by foreign investors of state-owned enterprises, was driving the huge increase in foreign investment flows which it reckons could hit a trillion dollars this year. </p> <p>\"A global marketplace for firms is emerging,\" said Karl P Sauvant, chief author of the re port. \"Companies are being bought and sold across borders on an unprecedented scale.\" </p> <p>The value of completed cross border M&amp;As totalled $720bn and involved about 6,000 separate transactions. </p> <p>However, 109 mega-deals of more than $1bn accounted for 60% of the total. Most of these took place in the developed world. </p> <p>Unctad's Gabriele Kohler said that at the firm level, foreign investment decisions were based on a desire to expand market share in an increasingly integrated global economy. \"It's quick way of accessing productive capacity,\" she said. </p> <p>Cross-border mergers had also been boosted by technological change, deregulation and by the growing tendency for mergers to be financed through stock-swaps rather than cash. </p> <p>\"This option is frequently used in deals where the sheer size makes cash payment virtually impossible,\" said Unctad.</p>",
  "\"For we are the people of England that never have spoken yet!\" one speech ended, with a Chestertonian flourish. True enough. Looking round the hall, this rum crowd led by an even weirder lot on the platform never has and never will speak for England. \"We are the oldest political party in the world!\" the chairman proclaimed to a roar of applause. Nearer the truth but even that can't be quite right either. Surely the Chinese gerontocracy must be a bit older? Tory party membership fell again this year - maybe not defections, just dropping off the perch. Who's left? Staring-eyed young men who babble only Europhobia, rich farmers and rather cross old women. <p>Arriving in Bournemouth determined to be a) fair and b) scared, it was an impossible task. Everything should be going the Conservatives' way - the Danish No vote, the \"great September tax revolt\" and the first - if brief - opinion poll lead in eight years. The shallowness of Tony Blair's support, long flagged up by pollsters, has been brutally exposed: where are those not on his payroll who declare passionate admiration for him and Labour? Support is wide but cool. All his early ducking and weaving has left too few ardent devotees. Now pensions and petrol, the dome and disappointment have Labour on the run. Not a bad thing. How pleasingly it sharpened their ideological identity when a genuine blue peril rattled their gates last week. Less big tent, more tribalism gave a new edge and urgency, a welcome definition of Labour's \"irreducible core\". </p> <p>So it was worthwhile trying to be frightened by watching William Hague announced many times a day as \"Our next prime minister!\" But no, he's not going to be. Not in any imaginable circumstance, bar Blair caught with trousers down, hand in till amid economic meltdown. The only four the public have heard of - Hague, Portillo, Widdecombe and Maude - make a gruesome spectacle as holders of the four great offices of state. (It's lucky no one recognises the second rank - and there is no third rank at all.) </p> <p>The truth is that as each new Tory policy unfurls, it becomes ever plainer that even they don't believe a word of it themselves. These people, who only three years ago held high office, managed large budgets and struggled to make policy work in devilish detail on the ground, cannot conceivably imagine that they are about to implement this list of nonsense. Only the No to the euro has the force of conviction: everything else is dressing up, trying on a ragbag of populist clothes. It's all fantasy policy - not what works, but what sounds as if it will. </p> <p>So inner-city tower blocks are to be knocked down, urban deserts made desirable so people no longer flee to the green fields where Tory heartlands are given a new power to veto any building in their back yards to keep them out. More noisy neighbours will be served with far harsher evic tion orders: where will they go? There will be none because the deterrence will work so well. Everyone will get married and stay married with the restoration of the Married Couples Allowance of \u00a3285 a year. It doesn't matter that divorce and extra-marital childbirth soared while this tiny MCA was paid: it's just something plausible to say. Under 30s can opt out of national insurance and put all their money into private pension accounts. What of the \u00a34bn hole that leaves in paying out for today's pensioners each year? No answer. Three pence off the fuel tax - 45p a week on average - just something to say that sounds good for now. Lock up all asylum seekers! What, imprison all 78,000 awaiting adjudication? More than doubling the 65,000 criminals in prison already at \u00a325,000 per prisoner per year? </p> <p> Don't hold your breath for a proper costing of this strange scrapbook of vague ideas. They don't seem to care if no serious person believes in them. If a policy makes a one-day headline, that's all that matters - hit and run without price tag. If pressed, they say they will abolish all Labour's social projects for the poor - things most people have barely heard of starting with the New Deal. The danger is that Labour has so mumbled and undersold its huge social programme that some day it could indeed all be swept away with few but the poor any the wiser. The Blair project has not rooted this grand war on poverty securely enough in the national imagination the way Attlee or Roosevelt did to make it safe for the future, because the prime minister was ambivalent about how it would play in middle England. </p> <p>So far, search as they might in every corner there is no positive Conservative big idea, nothing that flies. Only the negative No-to-Europe stirs real emotion beyond this enclave, but even on this popular ground their vehemence brands them as weird fanatics not wise pragmatists. What other winners have they? The dome, the dome, the dome in every speech from floor and platform, linked to a potentially dangerous slogan: Labour's \"tax and waste\". The dome stands as a sorry emblem of all the billions Labour has spent with still so little to show for it, so many promises yet so little achieved - so far. This line may pack a painful negative punch, yet even so the Tories still lack a big positive idea, a clincher. </p> <p>They yearn for that totem - a practical popular policy that symbolises Conservative freedoms the way Mrs Thatcher's council house sales said it all in 1979. Despite so many populist policies, grasping at every butterfly, none of it resonates with meaning, none of it flies beyond Bournemouth. </p> <p>Some new Tory policies look like a divine gift for Labour. Privatising pensions, privatising the NHS and universities, selling off the welfare state, all these are bound to repel more voters than they will attract at the next election. A malicious mind might suspect Michael Portillo has laid these deliberate traps to prevent any hope of his leader's election. But if he is playing the long game, he might well be cannily right. It should be a salutary warning to Labour that this may be the last chance for the welfare state. If in the next five years after so much money and determination, Labour still does not deliver schools and hospitals that match modern expectations then here is the Portillo agenda for the following election. Failure this time might indeed make privatisation look like the only credible route left to try. </p> <p>Labour's first response to a flicker of life returning to the Tory parrot was auspicious. It made them braver and clearer. We wait to see if that better impulse carries them through to election day, eschewing the directionless populism that will in the end expose William Hague to ridicule by the very people he woos so assiduously. </p> <p> <a href=\"mailto:polly.toynbee@theguardian.com\">polly.toynbee@theguardian.com</a></p>",

The shares have fallen from a peak of more than \u00a36 to a low of about 30p this year.</p> <p>Renco, which has been carrying out due diligence for four months, is understood to be waiting for clearance from the European commission for the government's \u00a3100m in aid to the coal industry.</p> <p>RJB, which declared a \u00a310m pre-tax loss for the first six months in August, is due to gain \u00a370m under the package designed to avert a further round of pit closures and preserve the indigenous coal industry through a period of unstable global energy demand.</p> <p>RJB owns 13 deep-mined pits, including two - Ellington, near Morpeth, and Clipstone, Notts, rescued when ministers announced the aid.</p> <p>RJB employs 8,000 miners and produces 23m tonnes a year but has slipped into financial difficulties because of geological problems, cheap imports and low global prices.</p>"
