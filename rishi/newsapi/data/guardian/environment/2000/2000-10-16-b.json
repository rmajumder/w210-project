  "<p>Almost ten years to the day since then environment secretary Michael Portillo gleefully \"topped out\" the steel cap to Canary Wharf, the Docklands monument to capitalism has come of age. In a low-key announcement yesterday, the stock exchange confirmed that Canary Wharf is to join the FTSE 100 index. </p> <p>It has been a long, bumpy road, but the tallest building in Britain is finally winning acceptance. The main tower at 1 Canada Square is 99.9% full, two more towers are nearly finished and Canary Wharf has this week agreed to take control of a further slice of land on the bank of the River Thames. </p> <p>A recent surge in the company's share price has taken the value of Canary Wharf to \u00a33.8bn, which means the family of chief executive Paul Reichmann is sitting on a stake worth \u00a3255m. The group is even considering a bid for the site of the Millennium Dome. </p> <p>However, it has hardly been an easy ride. On the windy November day in 1990 when the tower was completed, Mr Portillo declared: \"The prophets of doom, with their nonsense about white elephants, have already been proved wrong.\" </p> <p>He was soon to swallow his words, as the site's Toronto-based developer Olympia &amp; York put Canary Wharf into administration. It became a symbol of the unsustainable excess of Thatcherism. </p> <p>Too many buildings had gone up in London, causing a collapse in rents when the economy slowed down. It was years before demand for office space caught up with supply. Canary Wharf acquired an image problem that it has never truly shaken off - of soulless nightlife, poor transport links and hostile surrounding neighbourhoods. </p> <p>Yet for all its critics, Canary Wharf has bounced back. Mr Reichmann, the former boss of Olympia &amp; York, led a consortium which bought the company back for \u00a3800m five years ago. </p> <p>Since then, the company has been helped by the continuing growth of the financial services sector and more recently, the birth of thousands of dot.com companies in search of space in central London. </p> <p>Consolidation among banks and stockbrokers has created larger organisations in search of bigger buildings than ever. Canary Wharf has been able to respond more quickly and cheaply than its rivals, partly due to the underground infrastructure of pipes, networks and plumbing laid by its ambitious founders. </p> <p>Meanwhile, developers finally appear to be running out of space in the Square Mile. Just 2m sq ft of offices are due to become available in the City in the next six months - a figure which has fallen 52% in the last year, and is at its lowest level since 1988. </p> <p>Property analyst John Atkins of HSBC says: \"There is a growing shortage of office space in central London, more particularly of high quality space, and more specifically in large units.\" </p> <p>Surging demand has allowed Canary Wharf to bring forward its plans and it will complete the next stage of its development - towers for HSBC and Citigroup - early next year. </p> <p>Mr Atkins says: \"The one advantange they've got above all the others is speed. They know exactly what's under the ground - they don't have to worry about any archeological remains, unlike the City, and they can throw things up quickly and not too expensively.\" </p> <p>Canary Wharf's estate is creeping out towards both edges of the Isle of Dogs. In its latest expansion, the company yesterday said it was paying \u00a334m to buy out Singapore-based Pidemco and Hotel Properties, its joint venture partners in a riverside site to the west of the main Canada Square. </p> <p>This will provide space for further shops and restaurants - the group is anxious to counter complaints that the area is a graveyard for entertainment. In fact, it already has 130 shops and is classed a \"sub-regional shopping centre\". Most of the main bar chains are in evidence. A Canary Wharf insider boasts: \"You can never get into All Bar One here these days - it's heaving.\" </p> <p>The extension of the Jubilee Line has been crucial in attracting new businesses. In the early days, Canary Wharf was only served by the Docklands Light Railway, which stopped in the early evenings and never ran at all over the weekends. </p> <p>The arrival of the tube has been one of the only indisputable improvements for local communities. For, despite its belated financial success, critics point out that Canary Wharf has struggled to fulfil one of the original aims of the Thatcher-inspired enterprise zone - to help lift Docklands out of poverty. </p> <p><strong>Tall storeys 12 towering years</strong></p> <p><strong> May 1988</strong> Construction begins at Canary Wharf </p> <p><strong> August 1991</strong> State Street first tenant to move in </p> <p><strong> May 1992</strong> Canary Wharf's developer, Olympia &amp; York, goes into administration </p> <p><strong> October 1993 </strong> Rescued by consortium led by Lloyds Bank </p> <p><strong> October 1994</strong> Working population reaches 10,000 </p> <p><strong> December 1995 </strong> Sold for \u00a3800m to group including current boss Paul Reichmann, Prince al Waleed and Franklin Resources </p> <p><strong> February 1996</strong> IRA bomb explodes at nearby South Quay, killing two people </p> <p><strong> November 1997 </strong> Tony Blair holds summit with President Chirac at Canary Wharf </p> <p><strong> April 1999</strong> Flotation values Canary Wharf at \u00a32.2bn </p> <p><strong> September 1999</strong> Jubilee line station opens </p> <p><strong> September 2000 </strong> Canary Wharf makes first full-year profit </p> <p><strong> October 2000 </strong> Joins FTSE 100</p>",
  "Half a century ago, Rumbek secondary school was the only secondary school in southern Sudan, and it was the pride of British colonialism. Its long, low brick classrooms were built around a large courtyard shaded by giant mango trees. <p>Catholic and Protestant chapels stood just beyond the central courtyard, with dormitories, a refectory, an orchard, a vegetable garden, offices and teachers' houses spread out over a large area; it was the orderliness of Surrey transported to one of the wildest parts of the empire to forge a new elite on the British model. </p> <p>\"This school was the manufacturer of the first generation of politicians in the south. All the officers of Anyanya 1 [the group of insurgents that led the first southern rebellion, which started in 1955 before the British left] passed through this school,\" said one graduate and a former commander of the organisation into which Anyanya evolved, the Sudan People's Liberation Army (the SPLA). </p> <p>As the rebellion grew in the south in the 1960s, schools were closed and Rumbek secondary, with all its pupils and staff, was taken to the north. When peace was signed between north and south in 1972, the pupils organised the immediate return of the school. </p> <p>\"We came down all together by train, leaving the teachers to follow,\" said one of the move's organisers, later to become an SPLA commander. </p> <p>Once war broke out in the south in 1983 following the declaration of sharia Islamic law by Khartoum, the school's brief life as the cradle of the southern elite ended abruptly; its grounds became a government military barracks. </p> <p>The soldiers built a mosque, and pulled down the outlying buildings and the teachers' houses. The empty chapels now have Arabic slogans written on the walls. A broken-down military truck occupies a corner of the courtyard, where the odd bullet shines in the dust, and the laboratories have become the kitchen, housing two great vats of sorghum porridge and broth for cooking soup. Dozens of vultures perch on the roof. </p> <p>Three years ago the SPLA took Rumbek town and, as the town began to revive, the people reopened the secondary school. \"We had to, it is the identity of the south, the nucleus of our struggle,\" said one teacher. </p> <p>The reopening was a community effort, but there were few resources. Last year when the harvest was good, the townspeople contributed food. But this year southern Sudan faces another serious food deficit and the people have none to give. The students' food must be bought using some of the \u00a330 fee each pupil pays a year. </p> <p>How their families find the battered and torn Sudanese pound notes in this society, where life is mainly subsistence farming and barter and most adult males are dead or in the SPLA, is a mystery. </p> <p>In the classrooms, the students sit on home-made bamboo chairs, packed 80 or 100 to a room. There are now 380 students, in their late teens to late 20s. The school has only nine permanent teachers and 11 part-time ones. Three of these were released from the military by the SPLA at the request of the headmaster. Most of them are graduates, but not trained teachers. None draws a salary, nor any equipment except for a very few books. </p> <p>The teachers' greatest frustration is not only the consistent lack of books, but the fact that the students are often completely unprepared. Although primary schools have been reopened in the liberated areas for several years, their standards are minimal. </p> <p>\"The children arrive here with no background. Their teachers are so poorly educated that it is often like starting from scratch with boys in their 20s,\" said one English literature teacher. </p> <p>He is teaching George Orwell's Animal Farm and Alan Paton's Cry the Beloved Country, the books he was taught and loved himself a generation ago. But to his class, even much of the vocabulary is new. </p> <p>\"We have completely lost the battle for education,\" said one priest. \"Suppose peace comes, how can we even begin to negotiate with the northerners when they have degrees and we are coming from the village?\" </p> <p>The older generation were so well educated in this school that it hurts them deeply to know the next generation have lost out so dramatically. </p> <p>\"Before the war we had the British Council giving us scholarships and teachers,\" said one teacher. \"What's happened to you people that you do not bother now, when we are so much in need?\" </p> <p>Oxfam and Unicef have dug pit latrines, provided a grinding mill and some exercise books. The school's main donor looks like being the US Agency for International Development, which has promised $300,000 (\u00a3210,000) for teacher training and curriculum development; it has emphasised the importance of including girls. </p> <p>Endorsing this, one foreign aid official declared: \"We want many, many Margaret Thatchers, and many, many Indira Gandhis to come out of this school.\" </p> <p>There are now just three girls in the school, one of whom is 29 and a mother of three. The second, a tall determined-looking young woman who speaks English as impeccably as the first generation of Rumbek students, wants to be a doctor. </p> <p>She is following a tradition in the south: the first female graduate, the first female commissioned officer, and the first female doctor all came from Rumbek. \"But this was before the war spoiled everything,\" said one teacher bitterly. </p> <p><b>How the war destroys normal life</b></p> <p><b> 1955</b> First rebellion by southern Anyanya insurgents (an event known as Anyanya 1) </p> <p><b> 1956</b> Sudan becomes independent from Britain </p> <p><b> 1972</b> Addis Ababa peace agreement between north and south </p> <p><b> 1981</b> Anyanya 2 rebellion starts in south </p> <p><b> 1983</b> Khartoum proclaims Islamic sharia law </p> <p><b> 1983</b> Sudan People's Liberation Army/Anyanya merge </p> <p><b> 1980s</b> SPLA takes large parts of south </p> <p><b> 1986</b> SPLA talks with northern opposition </p> <p><b> 1989</b> National Islamic Front military coup in Khartoum </p> <p><b> 1995</b> Asmara agreement brings northern opposition and SPLA together in National Democratic Alliance </p> <p><b> Sudan's long history of civil war means that:</b> </p> <p>\u0095 Successive generations of children - more than 3m - have grown up without access to adequate primary education.

  "\"Gloom\" is the word that best describes the Israeli papers' coverage of the Sharm el-Sheikh summit. On the Palestininian and Arab side, the word is \"anger\". <p>The <a href=\"http://www.khaleejtimes.com/\" target=\"_new\">Khaleej Times</a>, in the United Arab Emirates, reports a rare outbreak of Palestinian anger against their own leader, Yasser Arafat: \"Many Palestinians voiced anger yesterday at President Yasser Arafat's agreement to attend an emergency Middle East summit, accusing him of wasting the sacrifices of more than two weeks of clashes with Israel. </p> <p>\"The United States and the European Union have pushed Arafat to meet Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and try to end 17 days of bloodshed in which 100 people have been killed, all but seven of them Palestinians or Israeli Arabs. To many Palestinians, today's Sharm el-Sheikh summit is an attempt to defang an Arab summit scheduled for October 21-22, called to bolster the Palestinians' refusal to accept Israel's terms for peace, notably on the thorny issue of Jerusalem.\" </p> <p>Arafat's own <a href=\"http://www.pna.org/mininfo\" target=\"_new\">ministry of information</a> offers its usual <a href=\"http://www.pna.org/mininfo/press/eps_1610.htm\" target=\"_new\">roundup of local headlines</a> and adds a bonus, its own editorial take on the summit: \"The success of this summit from a Palestinian point of view is for the summit to end the military and economic siege imposed on the Palestinian occupied territories, stopping the threats and accusations levelled against the Palestinian people and leadership and the establishment of an international commission of inquiry to investigate the bloody massacres of Palestinians, and the provocative visit of [Likud leader Ariel] Sharon to the Al-Aqsa mosque.\" </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.jordantimes.com\" target=\"_new\">Jordan Times</a> wants more from the summit. It comments sadly that even a few weeks ago all the people of the region thought that violent confrontation had been consigned to history. Now, says the paper, it's not just the Israelis and Palestinians who are searching again for peace.</p> <p>\"Jordanians are right in saying their country stands to lose the most after the Palestinians and Israelis if violence does not stop and dialogue does not resume, to find a just and lasting settlement accepted by both peoples. The latest outbreak of violence has yet again shown all of us that our efforts to join the global economy and further boost economic reform to ease the impact of poverty and unemployment could suddenly be harmed by yet another war.\"</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.jpost.com\" target=\"_new\">Jerusalem Post</a> believes that Arafat and the Palestinians are no longer interested in negotiation or in peace. The paper urges Israel to recognise this, and, in effect, to reoccupy the Palestinian territories: \"The Palestinians have long argued that all Israel understands is force. The Israeli corollary to this assumption is that all the Palestinians understand is facts on the ground. The hard-learned lesson of the last seven years is that Israel could well have to return to the policies of the previous 26 years: that of slowly creating facts on the ground that increase the territorial price of the Palestinian refusal to negotiate peace.\" </p> <p>Even Israel's <a href=\"http://www.haaretzdaily.com\" target=\"_new\">Ha'aretz</a>, normally the voice of moderation and optimism, can see little good coming of the summit: \"With respect to Israel, it appears that Barak has not yet closed the door on a resumption of the negotiations. But from the Palestinian side, no peaceful voices have been heard. And Arafat, caught in a militant mood, is sending no indications of wanting an agreement. As things look on the eve of the summit, there appears to be no guarantee of its success, and the chances of continuing the diplomatic process appear slim.\" </p>",

  "Summit meetings, like that taking place today in the Egyptian resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh between the Israelis, the Palestinians and the US president, fall into several different categories, ranging from useful to pointless. Summits also tend to work in very different ways. <p><b>1. The crisis summit.</b> After two weeks of barely controlled violence that has left more than 100 dead, the Palestinian-Israeli summit falls into this category. Arranged at very short notice, principally by the UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, and US envoys, its minimalist objective is to stop the two sides killing each other and to get them talking again.</p> <p>The fact that President Bill Clinton broke off other engagements and flew overnight to Egypt from Washington underlines the emergency nature of this meeting. In the past, a US leader would not get personally involved in such a meeting unless something truly momentous was on the cards. Yet even Mr Clinton is not looking to achieve more than a ceasefire.</p> <p>A quick resumption of the peace-process negotiations was not in prospect - and certainly not the conclusion of a final settlement on which Mr Clinton pinned his hopes at last July's Camp David summit. On the other hand, a summit collapse was not ruled out.</p> <p>Today's summit, where a series of bilateral meetings between the participants is expected to precede lunch and an afternoon plenary session, also typifies the modern trend towards proximity talks - that is to say, summits within summits. Under this system, it is not unknown, if things do not go well, for the principal summiteers never to meet each other, but to talk instead to intermediaries and go-betweens.</p> <p><b>2. The chummy summit.</b> This type of meeting was pioneered by Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev in the days when there were still two global superpowers - the US and Soviet Union - and regular superpower summits.</p> <p>Reagan and Gorbachev got on so well that, to the great alarm of their advisers and military top brass, they nearly agreed, at a summit in Reykjavik in the mid-80s, to sweeping reductions in each other's nuclear arsenals.</p> <p>Other superpower summits were notable for the evolution of the \"walk-in-the-woods\" approach, when top negotiators would desert the conference room and their aides and try and work out problems one-to-one. This sometimes led to enormous confusion, when their private deals were disowned by their leaders.</p> <p><b>3. The rolling summit.</b> These are the sort of meetings that give summits a bad name, devaluing their importance and raising questions about the point of such gatherings.</p> <p>The European Union is one of the worst offenders in this regard. Until recently, the Council of Ministers held a six-monthly, heads-of-government summit at the end of each country's presidency. (The presidency revolves between the 15 EU member states.)</p> <p>But a new trend is to hold secondary or even tertiary summits within the six-month period. This happened earlier this year during the Portuguese presidency, which held the \"dot-com\" summit on IT halfway through its term. The French pulled the same trick last week, convening a summit in Biarritz to discuss the forthcoming December summit in Nice. According to most reports, Biarritz merely served to emphasise how little of the Nice agenda is agreed. So what was the actual point of the summit?</p> <p><b>4. The mini-summit.</b> People such as Tony Blair and the French president, Jacques Chirac, just love this format. Despite their many public policy differences, they regularly get together over a quiet dinner for a private chat about what matters most to each. Only the other day, Mr Chirac popped over to Downing Street one evening to talk about EU reform and defence cooperation.</p> <p>This trend has caught on in a big way with all international leaders whose instinctive response to a crisis or emergency is to hold a meeting of two or three leaders, then make it sound more important by calling it a summit.</p> <p>Lower-ranking government officials like foreign ministers and finance ministers, and officials from big international organisations, such as the World Bank and IMF, have not been slow to follow suit.</p> <p>Sometimes, however, as in Prague last month and Seattle last year, those not invited to attend such summits - which usually means everybody but the self-selected, favoured few - get uppity, demonstrate, and play party-poopers. The usual response is, however, to plan yet another summit which will be less easy to subvert.</p> <p><b>5. The summit of ambition.</b> Really historic summits are much rarer than one might think. The meeting earlier this year between the leaders of the two Koreas, after a virtual state of war lasting more than 50 years, could be said to be a truly significant event that will have a direct, positive impact on millions of lives. That was recognised last week when President Kim Dae-jung of South Korea was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.</p> <p><b>6. The silly summit.</b> Perhaps the opposite of the Korean summit meeting was the truly ridiculous UN millennium summit in New York last month. This was attended by the leaders of more than 150 countries and, basically substance-free. Despite the best efforts of Kofi Annan, it became a jamboree turned photo-op. There were lots of fond hopes expressed, but no discernible benefits accrued to anyone except perhaps the participants and their partners - who got to go shopping in the Big Apple.</p>",
  "<p>Vivendi, the French media and telecoms group, yesterday agreed to sell its 23% holding in BSkyB as a means of gaining approval for its \u00a366bn merger with Canada's Seagram. </p> <p>The European commission set three conditions as it gave approval to the creation of what will be called Vivendi Universal. It has already been cleared in the US. </p> <p>The business will span mobile phone networks, the Universal Hollywood studios, Universal Music, internet portals and pay television in Europe. The deal had been hailed in June as the first European media group which could meet rivals in the US eye to eye. </p> <p>The agreement to divest the BSkyB shares ends what has on occasion been an uncomfortable relationship between Rupert Murdoch, whose News Corporation controls the company, and Jean-Marie Messier of Vivendi. </p> <p>The divestment, which was announced yesterday morning, had little effect on the BSkyB share price, which closed up 7p at 907p. The sale could also mean that Vivendi will no longer become a significant shareholder in Sky Global Networks, the holding company for all of Mr Murdoch's satellite pay-television businesses which is due for a stock market flotation later this year. </p> <p>Mr Messier hinted that he could still play a part in the new SGN company, however, and said: \"All doors remain open\". BSkyB's link to the Fox film studios through News Corp was the EC's main cause for concern. Vivendi has two years to sell its stake. \"We will take our time and examine together with Rupert Murdoch the best way to exit from BSkyB for both us and News Corp,\" Mr Messier said. </p> <p>The divestment, he added, would be made with a view to maintaining \"the excellent quality\" of their relationship. </p> <p>Under the second EC stipulation, Vivendi must offer to rival pay-TV operators access to Universal's film output . It has guaranteed that its own pay-TV operation, Canal+, will not hold first rights to more than 50% of Universal's film production. </p> <p>The Canal+ commitment covers the French, Belgian, Italian, Dutch, Spanish and Nordic countries over a five-year period. The third issue was Vivendi's multi-access internet portal, Vizzavi, which caused competitive concerns over the emerging online music market. To answer that worry, Vivendi will offer rival portals access to Universal's online music content, also for five years. </p> <p>Last year Mr Messier attempted to broker a merger between Canal+ and BSkyB but the talks ended in acrimony over which side would emerge in control of the combined operation. Mr Messier then rattled Mr Murdoch by building a stake of 25% in BSkyB, which has since been diluted by new shares being issued. Relations between the two men though are said to have warmed. </p> <p>A BSkyB spokesman said: \"Vivendi has been a very supportive shareholder over the past year. We now intend to enter into discussions with Vivendi with a view to ensuring an orderly disposal of their stake.\" </p> <p>The deal cements Mr Messier's position as one of the most powerful media figures worldwide. Since he took the helm of what was then G\u00e9n\u00e9rale-des-Eaux in 1996, Mr Messier has reshaped the utility as a media and communications business. </p> <p>Seagram's Universal music publishing business is the largest in the world and includes artists Boyzone, Elton John and Shania Twain, while its film business has scored hits with The Mummy and Gladiator. </p> <p>Its television arm produces shows including Xena Warrior Princess and has a library of programmes such as Kojak, Murder She Wrote and Miami Vice providing a wealth of content for Vivendi's pay-TV networks.</p>",
  "The second big presidential debate was like nothing so much as the Charge of the Light Brigade at Balaclava in 1854. Instructed to seize the guns, the 600 rode suicidally in the wrong direction, and Al Gore did the same when he faced George Bush in Boston. The guns he seized were his own. He sacrificed his superior knowledge and experience on all aspects of policy. He fell over himself to assure the watching millions that he agreed with Bush on this and that. And when Bush laid himself open to charges of ignorance and hypocrisy, Gore spared him. <p>It was the most depressing spectacle and a disservice to the several million fence-sitters who will decide who will be the next president. </p> <p>How did it come about? Everybody and the polls agreed the day after the first debate that Gore won easily. Then three things conspired to change the result, manifest in a sharp rise in the polls for Bush. First, instant replay. When it came to anything other than a vacuous generalisation in that first debate, Bush was open mouthed like a fish gasping for air. The trouble was Gore showed his contempt by rolling his eyes and shaking his head. In the week following, television replayed this image without illustrating the provocation. \"Where were the man's manners?\" became a staple of conversation, instead of focusing the question on Bush: \"Where was the man's mind?\" </p> <p>Next, the Dick Cheney-Joe Lieberman encounter. The press and the Democrats had written off Cheney, but he scored big time. His directness and dry wit were much more convincing than the treacly lovefest Lieberman initiated with his friend \"Dick\". It was hailed as a gentleman's discourse but it had no virtue except that, for the Republicans, it blurred the differences. </p> <p> And then, the Republican war room swung into action and scored a major success with a lazy press. Once again, caught in story mode syndrome, they pounded a drumbeat all week on the narrative line that Gore is a liar. </p> <p>Gore's staff panicked. They made him watch a parody of his debating style from television's Saturday Night Live. They abjured him to avoid anecdotes where he might misstep. Gore would indeed have been well advised to make a small correction in his style towards deference, but he over-compensated. Unlike Bill Clinton, he is tone deaf to nuance. He did not merely control his facial reactions; he put his brain on ice. He grovelled. He was utterly out of character for two-thirds of the debate and it represented a sell-out to his convictions. There were cheers across the land when he woke from his sycophantic narcolepsy, but it was too late. </p> <p>And now to the campaign on lying that so rattled the Democrats. The first thing to note is that the people calling Gore a liar are liars themselves. The Gore \"lies\" are not so much lies as irrelevant and inconsequential misremembering of circumstance. No, on one particular visit to a Texas forest fire he was not accompanied by the director, but by a deputy. But yes he did visit Texas disaster areas many times and that was the point. </p> <p>The main attack by the Republican spin machine has proven false itself. Gore quoted a newspaper report about a girl who had to stand up because she had no desk at school. The school principal, embarrassed by the revelation, denied it and the credulous national media accepted that denial as evidence of a Gore fib without any further inquiries. In fact, as the Sarasota Herald Tribune has made clear, a dramatic budget cut has high school students going without desks for weeks. Good politics for the Republicans maybe, but lousy journalism. </p> <p>The most sickening thing about the Republican fib factory is that while the moralisers have been regurgitating the propaganda, they have ignored really substantive lies by Bush. Forget amazing small errors like saying, with glee, that Texas would execute three men for a hate crime, when it's two men, and he is supposed to stand aloof pending appeals. There are examples of his mendacity - or his faculty for memory-loss and myth-making - that will affect people's lives. He said in the debate that he is in favour of hate-crime laws, but he has rejected them in Texas. He asserted that the percentage of people insured for health was going up in Texas but down nationally when both have risen. He described the Kyoto agreement on global warming as imposing controls only on the US, but it is multilateral. He says he is for clean air, but has given in to the polluters in his own state. He said he favours checks on guns bought at shows, but rejects the three-day waiting period that would enable them to be effective. He says he will pay for popular new programmes by using a quarter of the budget surplus, but his own budget shows he has allocated less than half that much. </p> <p>Will the real Al Gore stand up before America sells itself short to the spinners? </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The European Commission's clearance of the AOL and Time Warner merger was a complex, drawn-out process which had commentators guessing and double-guessing the outcome until they tied themselves into knots. But no-one came near predicting the outcome of the \u00a366bn corporate marriage between the French media company, Vivendi, and Seagram of Canada, the owner of Universal studios. To get to the altar, Vivendi was forced to serve divorce papers on one of its key interests: British Sky Broadcasting.</p> <p>Vivendi has agreed to sell its 23% holding in the company over the next two years to assuage EC concerns that Vivendi Universal, as the new company will be known, will not link up with Fox studios, which is a sister company of BSkyB as Rupert Murdoch owns both. Attention will now turn to one of the more fractious relationships in the media world: that between Mr Murdoch and the Vivendi chairman, Jean-Marie Messier.</p> <p>Sky said: \"Vivendi has been a very supportive shareholder over the past year. BSkyB now intends to enter into discussions with Vivendi with a view to ensuring an orderly disposal of their stake. Any disposal has no effect on the fundamental business success of BSkyB.\"</p> <p>But the rapport between Mr Murdoch and M Messier has cooled over the past 12 months since an attempt to merge Canal Plus, Vivendi's pay-TV arm, and BSkyB foundered on disputes over who would control the company. The relationship seemed to be warming up recently after Mr Murdoch made conciliatory noises in press briefings, but the EC has thrown things up in the air again.</p> <p>The centre of the dispute has been Vivendi's role in Sky Global Networks, the company formed by the satellite TV operations in Mr Murdoch's News Corporation. M Messier had threatened to sell his stake in BSkyB unless Mr Murdoch allowed it to be converted into shares in SGN. M Messier has now been forced to give up a useful lever against his rival.</p> <p>The Frenchman is now a very powerful global media player, and Mr Murdoch's star may be waning, but SGN is a significant global satellite platform which will be the ideal carrier for Vivendi Universal's masses of content. A stake in SGN, which is expected to float at the end of the year, will confirm M Messier's ascendancy. The tenacious owner of News Corp has already shown his willingness to share out interests in SGN by selling 4.7% of it to US cable giant Liberty Media.</p> <p>The rest of the concessions forced out of Vivendi and Seagram have fewer ramifications. The second stipulation states that Vivendi must offer other pay-TV companies access to Universal's film output, which includes blockbusters such as The Mummy and Gladiator. A recent deal between the cable operator, NTL, and Universal Studio networks to set up a UK movie channel shows this is already being done.</p> <p>The third issue covers Vizzavi, Vivendi's pan-European, multi-access internet portal, a joint venture with Vodafone. Seagram*s Universal music publishing business is the largest in the world and Vivendi has promised it will offer rival portals access to Universal's online music content for five years.</p> <p>This final concession might leave the music companies, EMI and Warner Music, feeling hard done by, as the combination of internet access and back catalogues was enough to put their proposed merger on the back burner. However, Vizzavi has barely 1m subscribers at the moment and Warner Music found it hard to settle concerns over its links with AOL, which came from parent company Time Warner. Vizzavi's potential customer base is 80m, thanks to the presence of Vodafone and Vivendi's Cegetel telecoms subsidiary, but the EC clearly did not think it was of paramount inportance.</p> <p>It has been an exhausting process for M Messier, but the deal marks a stunning turnaround for his company. When he took over as chairman in 1996, Vivendi was predominantly a utilities firm. Four years later, it is one of the world's most powerful media conglomerates and only the AOL Time Warner merger has managed to overshadow it, though it may struggle to keep Vivendi Universal out of the limelight.</p>",
  "<p>Forum for the Future, the e-commerce think-tank launched in February by e-minister Patricia Hewitt, has hired Fishburn Hedges to handle the PR for a major research project.</p> <p>The Digital Futures project aims to explore the social impact of e-commerce and establish how it might benefit the UK. It is being put together by a consortium of 25 organisations, including three government departments, eight think-tanks and major corporations such as Unilever, BT and Amazon.co.uk.</p> <p>A final report, to be published in February 2001, will recommend ways in which government and business can benefit from the dot.com revolution.

  "<p>Shopping on the internet is as easy as A, B, C. So says the BBC which, although best-known as Britain's public service broadcaster, last Sunday week began a two-month bus roadshow to help the public shop online, and next week, in partnership with children's imprint Ladybird Books, publishes How it Works, Shopping on the Internet. </p> <p>How kind of Auntie to hold our hand while we shop online. Except that this initiative has little to do with altruism: the hope is that by encouraging a greater number of people into e-commerce, more money can be raised to help fund BBC radio and TV. </p> <p>It's a curious rationale, but the BBC is no stranger to such logic. In this case it's all about beeb.com, the corporation's three-and-a-half-year-old commercial internet service overseen by BBC Worldwide, reinventing and better positioning itself to turn a profit. </p> <p>From its launch, beeb.com has comprised a selection of the BBC's more commercial brands - mainly magazine spin-offs from BBC programmes - revised for online consumption. Limited e-commerce has been available to surfers clicking on banner ads through which they were whisked off to advertisers' own websites. </p> <p>A strategic review, however, concluded that this in itself was not maximising the potential for a commercial BBC online service. The upshot was the decision to reposition beeb.com, a process that started in December 1999 and culminated in a high-profile, \u00a37m national advertising campaign which kicked off last month. </p> <p>The beeb.com roadshow and Ladybird book (the latter idea taken from the current advertising, to stress how anyone can learn the best way to shop online) is part of this re-positioning initiative. </p> <p>\"The idea is to establish the [beeb.com] brand with the message that there is a degree of safety and a certain naturalness about doing e-business with the BBC,\" says Julian Turner, chief executive of Beeb Ventures, the majority-owned subsidiary of BBC Worldwide which runs the beeb.com site. \"As a shopping intermediary we offer the safety of a trusted environment and approved third-party partnerships.\" </p> <p>So from now on beeb.com is to be known as an internet shopping portal. Surfers visiting the site can select from a variety of subject areas, all of which are directly linked to pre-existing BBC brands ranging from magazines such as Top of the Pops and Gardeners' World to programmes such as BBC Holiday. Each themed area provides online editorial content related to specific types of product. Users can ask experts for advice on which product to buy, or call up other related information. </p> <p>The next step, however, is the nub of the new beeb.com service. Once users know what they want, they can call up details of different online suppliers - each of whom is a commercial partner in the beeb.com site - to compare price and delivery times. They then click on a preferred supplier to go direct to its site to complete the transaction online. To date, beeb.com has struck deals with 37 commercial partners which are featured on the site. Turner expects this figure to have risen to more than 60 by Christmas. </p> <p>It is through such commercial partnerships and banner advertising that beeb.com hopes to make money. Partners pay for the BBC association. In return, however, they must provide a good-quality, reliable and fairly priced service that reflects well on the BBC brand. No such relationship will be entered into with any commercial partner on an exclusive basis, Turner adds: \"It's not about the BBC becoming an e-tailer,\" he claims. \"It's about being a shopping intermediary which can offer a safe and trusted shopping environment and approved third-party relationships.\" </p> <p>It's certainly a step on from what beeb.com was doing previously - and one that is now being funded through a joint venture between BBC Worldwide and US-based internet firm TH Lee Global Internet Managers. This deal, announced in August, involved THLi investing a cool \u00a332.5m in beeb.com and freebeeb.net, the BBC's internet service provider. The transaction valued the two businesses at \u00a3240m. </p> <p>But the new beeb.com is not a development welcomed by Auntie's commercial competitors. Although not funded directly by the licence fee, the programme brands on which it is cashing in are, critics lament. Angela Mills of the British Internet Publishers' Alliance, whose members include not only traditional media owners with online interests but also pure internet-only businesses, expresses concern at the BBC's latest move. </p> <p>\"Because its positioning is 'shop here without trawling around lots of other websites', and because the brands it promotes heavily are all BBC brands developed by licence-fee funding, it's another example of the unfair competitive advantage the BBC has over its commercial competitors,\" she says. </p> <p>The BBC's public service sites, meanwhile, should provide no direct link with beeb.com, she adds: \"It's not as if they do so for any of beeb.com's commercial rivals.\" Although Turner stresses that all surfers are doing is moving from the corporation's public service to commercial online sites, and also insists beeb.com gives no undue prominence to BBC brands, Mills counters: \"This is little more than paying lip service to open access.\" </p> <p> Rob Hersov, chief executive of internet sports service Sportal, meanwhile, does not believe that the BBC should be on the net at all - either in a public service or a commercial capacity. \"It is impossible to name one public service they are giving [on the net] that a privately funded company is not providing already,\" he says. And of the corporation's commercial online activities, Hersov adds: \"They should not be doing any of these at all. [BBC Worldwide] should be sold off.\" </p> <p>Like it or loathe it, however, BBC Worldwide's brief is to raise funds through commercial activities that can be fed back into the BBC to supplement income earned from the licence fee. Given that this is its remit, Beeb Ventures - like the rest of the internet business - is surely justified in its desire to grow the internet population, not just for itself but for everyone, Turner says. </p> <p>\"What people forget is that if you link the BBC name with e-commerce, then you grow internet business for all,\" he claims. \"If we bring one new person onto the net, then we help everyone, as that person's propensity to go on to transact with other e-commerce sites is significant.\" </p> <p>Whether or not this continues to be an acceptable rationale for the public service broadcaster will become clear in coming months with the publication of a white paper on the BBC's future remit, and the expected introduction of a single broadcast industry regulator whose remit will include public service TV and all its related activities - including commercial initiatives online.</p>",
  "<p>The seventh annual Sheffield International Documentary Festival begins today, with a week of screenings of the best in contemporary documentary film-making as well as classics from the archives, masterclasses with names such as Frederick Wiseman, and industry sessions debating the state of the art. At first glance, it would appear that the feature-length documentary has never been stronger, but only a handful of the films being shown will ever make it to our television screens, and yet fewer will be given their chance in the cinema. </p> <p>Partly because British television has sported its \"Best TV in the World\" badge with such pride and for so long, the documentary tradition here is indelibly linked with the small screen - not in any way a problem when broadcasters are keen to celebrate diversity and offer their audience choice. But, in the ever-shifting sands of the television landscape, the future of the more challenging aspects of the schedules are increasingly uncertain. Feature-length documentaries have always given broadcasters trouble: necessarily long, often about \"difficult\" subjects, they tend to reach a limited audience. Yet, they regularly win awards at home and abroad. </p> <p>With the onset of digital, the position of this relatively expensive, low-rating and, some might say, unwieldy form is once again under discussion, most imminently at the BBC, where the BBC2 documentary strand Storyville is set to become part of the \"serious\" digital channel, BBC4. </p> <p>Nick Fraser, commissioning editor for Storyville, has had some big-hitters - Kurt And Courtney, Hoop Dreams, the Oscar-winning One Day in September - and is hoping that the strand he has been instrumental in shaping can survive the transition. </p> <p>Fraser has faced crisis point before, when the then controller of BBC2, Michael Jackson, cut Storyville's predecessor Fine Cut practically out of existence. But Mark Thompson took over and feature-length docs were once again in favour, and Storyville - with more money, and more slots - was born. </p> <p>Hardly surprising, then, that on arriving at Channel 4, Jackson was less than enthusiastic about its long-standing, well-respected strand True Stories. \"If I look back through my diary, in 1995 True Stories transmitted on Thursdays at 9.30pm, in 1997 on Tuesdays at 9pm, but by 1998 it was all over the place, going out at different times and different nights,\" says Peter Moore, former head of documentaries at Channel 4. </p> <p>The present controller of documentaries, Peter Dale, doesn't see scheduling decisions as indicative of less commitment: \"I don't believe that audiences are as concerned with strand identity,\" he explains. \"What counts to someone choosing their evening's viewing is not whether there is a True Stories film on, but that there is a documentary about something they are interested in.\" </p> <p>He also regards time slots as mattering in terms of individual films, rather than across a strand: \"In commercial terms our impression of audience habits are changing - by 10.30pm people are ready to sit down and watch something more challenging. I fight for the best position in the schedules on an individual basis.\" </p> <p>He does admit, however that his is not a view always welcomed by film-makers: \"I do find it frustrating that many film-makers who have been around a long time don't accept that the broadcasting environment is more competitive than it once was, and find it hard to accept that that has implications for where their work is placed.\" </p> <p>Such a close consideration of ratings is something Nick Fraser is hoping to avoid: \"What I'm worried about is the prospect of an A list and a B list. If BBC2 changes in the manner of C4 and decides to go for popularity, then there will be only certain subjects and certain big-name film-makers who will hold up in peak time. The danger is that the most challenging, most innovative films won't make it to the main channel.\" </p> <p>Not that Fraser believes in being worthy for the sake of it, in fact he's keen to encourage film-makers to consider the impact that their choice of subject-matter can have. \"They just don't sit down and make the connection that if they are going to make a long film, it should be a film that people will find especially intriguing and be willing to commit their time to. There is a kind of puritanism to do with documentaries, which keeps people away from popular culture and showbiz subjects.\" </p> <p>There are notable exceptions, of course: Nick Broomfield's Kurt and Courtney, Molly Dineen's Geri - even Kevin MacDonald's One Day in September was put together as a com mercial package. \"It was made to attract profile,\" Fraser admits. \"It's made to knock you over. It tries very consciously in every way to have that effect. And that is a new approach. Here are people setting out to invest over $100m in a documentary, and they are constantly thinking about the impact it will have in a cinema. So when documentary steps into that arena it becomes as calculated a project as any other movie. And maybe it has to be.\" </p> <p>\"There was a time when people imagined that documentary meant something that involved hard work, and would be good for you, but now people are aware that they can be moved and drawn into an unexpected world,\" Kim Longinotto, the director of Divorce Iranian Style, suggests. What time her films are transmitted does matter to her: \"You want them to go out at a good hour, you want them to be seen.\" Her latest film, Gaea Girls, is screening at Sheffield, before going on tour with a number of other docs around the BFI's regional film theatres and London's independent cinemas, something she finds very encouraging: \"If people will turn out at the cinema to see a documentary, I'm sure they can be encouraged to switch on at home.\" </p> <p>If the commercial pressures on terrestrial broadcasters are pushing feature documentaries to the margins of the schedules then the digital option may yet prove their saviour. Caroline Cooper, director of this year's Sheffield Festival, agrees: \"We are finding that the public's appetite for these documentaries is increasing. Last year's festival saw an increase of 35% in attendance, and the Docs On Tour programme was incredibly successful. If people can be enthused and excited about the documentary form, then perhaps a dedicated channel would concentrate and hold that interest.\" </p> <p>Nick Fraser agrees, albeit cautiously: \"It seems to help that the films are called Storyville, and it seems that that will continue on the new channel. I just have to keep from going completely crazy until the hierarchy at the BBC is sorted out and then I can begin commissioning films across two channels with a blank slate - in a way it's perfect, if it can be made to work. If the money's good enough, and it's distributed properly across both the terrestrial and digital channels, it could be a much better situation than I was in two or three years ago.\"</p>",
  "With apologies to the residents of Uckfield, Lamberhurst, Lewes and a host of other villages and towns across southern England who are surveying the mud-silted wreckage of their homes and businesses this morning, the floods couldn't have come at a better time. Indeed, a conspiracy theorist might concoct a notion that a bunch of eco-terrorists had sabotaged sluice gates to ensure the scenes we've had of flooded fields and high streets turned to churning rivers \u00e0 la Mozambique. The timing is excellent. We are only a month away from the Hague convention on climate change when the promises of Kyoto are supposed to be nailed down, and there is a real danger that the convention will go belly-up, in large part owing to US truculence. <p>Climate change induces a strange apathy. Everyone knows about it, few people do anything about it. If an environmentalist group launches a campaign to save a cuddly animal, it will get plenty of support, but only the really dedicated will write letters to their MP demanding a 20% cut in carbon emissions. An air of unreality has settled over the whole subject. Kyoto asked for cuts of 5% below 1990 levels, which the scientists assert is hopelessly inadequate. They say we need cuts of 60-80%. </p> <p>Yet even Kyoto may prove impossible. A decade after it was universally accepted that climate change was caused by carbon emissions, they are still rising. Not even scare stories seem to have had much effect. To cap it all, the fuel tax protest a month ago seemed the coup de grace, pre-empting the whole debate in the Hague. It could have been a textbook PR exercise on the part of the oil companies to demonstrate the power and stubbornness of the electorate: don't mess with our petrol. </p> <p>Just when it seemed that all was lost, rivers we had nearly forgotten about with richly redolent names such as the Beult, Uck, Ouse and Tiesse spring their wondrous revenge on our indifference. The rivers we had thought we had safely corralled proved our hubris. Seventeen severe flood warnings, 47 flood warnings, 97 flood watches: virtually the entire country was threatened by the worst floods in 40 years. The sense of outrage and anger from those affected suggested that we had forgotten that rivers flood. They always have done from time to time; what has changed is that they are now flooding frequently. We have to learn again the folk knowledge that was lost for a couple of generations about how rivers behave: where they flood, how they can suddenly rise and the destructive force of a river in spate. It was not for nothing that our ancestors worshipped water spirits; they knew their power, for creation and destruction. </p> <p>We lost this knowledge because we believed that such chances of nature could be ironed out by a combination of technology and government raising and applying the necessary revenue. Sue Tapsell, a fellow at Middlesex's Flood Hazard Research Centre, has done research on the impact of floods in County Durham and the Thames Valley; the common theme is the impulse to blame - it is someone's fault. What quickly follows is the angry comment of a man quoted last week who has been flooded three times this year: \"Something has got to be done.\" He is absolutely right. It has, but - here's the catch - it won't stop the floods. Even if we magically managed to cut our carbon emissions tomorrow, we will be reaping the results of the carbon we have already put into the atmosphere for generations to come. The consequences of all this for the faith and trust we have in government are legion - the environment does not pay dividends within an election cycle. </p> <p>The million-dollar question is how you close the gap between the angry \"something must be done\" and the dramatic shift in lifestyle and political priorities (investment in renewable energy before the NHS) that is necessary. Platform, a London-based group of activists and artists, advocates a process of reconnecting individuals and communities with their environment, which in cities is often buried under their feet. They have been running a campaign on London's rivers - Still Waters - many of which are no more than bricked over drains. On the river Wandle, a micro-hydroturbine powers some of the local primary school lights, and a bell is triggered on high tide. </p> <p> The task is herculean. Tapsell has done research with London schoolchildren on their attitudes to the countryside. Some had never been there; some didn't know what a river was; some said they'd prefer it if it was tidier and there were benches; some said the countryside scared them, they might be snatched by strangers or catch a disease. Country Life's survey of children's attitudes to the countryside last week revealed similar themes. </p> <p>One poignant comment indicated how regimented and confined is children's interaction with nature: \"You cannot sit on grass in case there are dog faeces.\" When Tapsell took a party of children to a river, they revelled in being allowed to get wet and muddy. Once it was in that intimate, intensely sensual experience of nature (on wasteland or in the countryside proper), that most children experienced their first taste of freedom. The exhilaration of building a den or climbing a tree is about escaping adult control. Our interaction with materials used to start with the mud and the puddles. Now it's in the hygienic playschool's water play. Somewhere along the line, we've lost the link between nature and freedom and drilled a fear of open spaces into children. They're relegated to the confines of the playground under a watchful eye, while the countryside is as real as video tape as it flashes past the car window. </p> <p>The twin principles which govern children's attitudes (and probably many of their parents) to the countryside are fear and sentimentalisation. Human life has never lasted so long, and never have so few lives been lost to accidents and serious illness in Britain, and yet we are more preoccupied than ever about preserving life and reducing risk. Partly in response to that sense of danger, we have constructed a children's entertainment industry predicated on airbrushing out the unpredictable brutality of nature: Bambi and Percy the Park-keeper. What help is the Jungle Book to the generation who will have to cope with more of the consequences of environmental degradation than ever before? </p> <p>The alternative, as environmental scientist James Lovelock has argued, is that we need a few really nasty shocks. If London, Hamburg or Washington DC were flooded, with a serious loss of life, we might finally start making connections between climate change and our unsustainable lifestyle. The problem about this argument is that by the time London floods, most of Bangladesh and the Nile delta will be long underwater. Rather, the best chance Britain has is a course of environmental ECT: lots of small, nasty shocks where it really hurts. So roll on the Uck, Beult and Tiesse, they've got a lot to teach us. The more floods, the merrier. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:madeleine.bunting@theguardian.com\">madeleine.bunting@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Ever since the devaluation of the Thai baht in July 1997 set off a domino effect around south-east Asia, it has been obvious that financial instability would not and could not be confined to the minnows of the global economy. And so it has proved. </p> <p>Those who believed that there was something new and different about America's speculative bubble were deluding themselves and the mood has clearly changed since the International Monetary Fund said last month that 2000 would be the best year for the world economy in more than a decade. As Nick Parsons of Commerzbank noted caustically last week, that was the biggest sell signal of the lot. </p> <p>The arrival of Wall Street at reality checkpoint has coincided with an escalation of the crisis in the Middle East. Corporate earnings are already being squeezed by a slowdown in consumer demand and companies now face the prospect of an increase in energy costs at a time when the tightness of the labour market means that they are less able to resist demands for higher wages. </p> <p> Analysts, who at the beginning of the year were merrily ignoring traditional measures of stock market value, have suddenly rediscovered their faith in a relationship between the earnings of a company and its share price. Their calculations belatedly confirm what the Cassandras have been saying since the mid-1990s - Wall Street is grossly over-valued and heading for a big correction. </p> <p>The bear market in equities was under way long before the attention of the world's media started to focus on what was happening in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. But the prospect of Lebanon, Syria and perhaps even Saudi Arabia being sucked into a wider geo-political struggle has added to the sense of panic. </p> <p>Even the dimmest dealer knows that it was a former crisis in the Middle East - the Yom Kippur war 27 years ago this month - that prompted the oil cartel, Opec, to raise the price of crude fivefold in late 1973 and early 1974, bringing first inflation and then recession to the west. </p> <p>As such, it is no surprise to find that there are some who believe that history is about to repeat itself. The Anglo-Saxon countries have enjoyed a long boom since the start of the 1990s and look just as vulnerable to an oil shock as they were in 1973. Should the price of crude stay at its current level - let alone rise to $40 or $50 a barrel - then the consequence would be a surge of inflation that would be followed by a severe monetary tightening and wave after wave of redundancies. </p> <p>After dabbling with 1970s music and 1970s fashion, we could complete the set with a dose of 1970s stagflation. What are the chances of this happening? Well, obviously, it would be utterly daft to rule it out. </p> <p>The odds on a hard landing in the US are shortening by the day, with companies under pressure to justify their inflated share prices, the banking sector awash with bad loans and consumers borrowing heavily to fund their spending habit. Financial deregulation and capital liberalisation - forced down the throats of other nations by the US treasury and Wall Street - may not look quite so clever when the hot money flows into America are reversed, bringing down the dollar and adding to inflationary pressure. </p> <p> We could, therefore, stand on the threshold of a new age of crisis. In years to come, we may look back on the last years of the 1990s as a brief oasis of prosperity in a desert of economic dislocation. However, let's try to look on the bright side. An alternative way of looking at recent events is to see them as a catharsis, with a crash on Wall Street not just the culmination of the financial turmoil that started in south-east Asia three years ago but the final thunderous chords of a symphony of darkness stretching back to the mid-1970s. Seen in this light, the trouble in the Middle East would not be the overture to a new crisis, but a coda to the last. </p> <p> One important reason for optimism is that we now live in a disinflationary age. In Britain, even after almost nine years of economic growth, we have car makers cutting prices, the Halifax offering higher rates of interest to its borrowers, supermarkets involved in a price war. This is not just the consequence of a strong pound, even though the reduction in the cost of imports caused by sterling's rise have been a factor. Competitive pressures, consumer resistance to higher prices and higher investment in new technology has changed the rules of the game and made the west less vulnerable to higher oil prices than it was in the 1970s. </p> <p>This point was made forcefully last week by Sushil Wadhwani, one of the nine members of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee. Taking advantage of the fact that the four \"outsiders\" on the MPC can now call on their own team of researchers, Mr Wadhwani has come up with some fascinating - if still tentative conclusions. </p> <p> Firstly, he says that the trade-off between growth and inflation has improved in the past decade, with forecasters underestimating growth and overestimating inflation. These errors have been considerable - around 0.5% a year in the case of both growth and inflation. Globalisation has been one factor in putting downward pressure on prices but privatisation and tougher regulation have led to a much tougher competitive environment. </p> <p> Mr Wadhwani says it is possible that \"the tendency to over-predict inflation is related to not paying enough attention to the possibility that the intensification of product market pressure has been altering some of the relationships built into existing macroeconometric models\". Including, presumably, the Bank's. </p> <p> But if firms are being skewered by an intensification of product market competition, why is it that profit margins are broadly unchanged since the start of the 1990s? Mr Wadhwani says that there are conditions in which the profit share would remain constant even with an increase in competition - a weakening of the power of labour or a technology-driven increase in productivity growth where the gains were disproportionately captured by capital. Like many other economists, Mr Wadhwani is convinced that the balance of power in the labour market has been profoundly affected by curbs on unions and tighter benefit rules. As a result, the old equations determining wages are now out of date, with the actual level of earnings growth coming in lower than expected. </p> <p> But it is the final part of the analysis which breaks new ground and is likely to cause most debate within the MPC. Mr Wadhwani argues that the increase in the capacity of the economy in the past decade may not have been picked up by official data. He says that using the stock of capital to measure the supply potential of the economy is difficult, and that too much emphasis may have been placed on fixed assets such as building and not enough on short-lived assets such as machinery, equipment and software, where growth rates have been much more rapid. </p> <p> Comparisons between UK and US prices for computers and software suggest, according to Mr Wadhwani, that inflation in new technology has been overstated and volume growth understated. He points out that in the US, software investment has averaged 140% of computer investment, in the UK it has been only 39%. Unless computers are being used as ornaments, this would appear to be highly unlikely. Working on the assumption that investment in software has been unrecorded and actually represents the same proportion of GDP in Britain as in the US, Mr Wadhwani and one of his researchers, Nicholas Oulton, found that growth would have been almost 0.4% a year higher between 1994 and 1998. Such a finding would, of course, have knock-on effects on productivity, unit labour costs and inflation and help to explain why the improvement in the growth-inflation trade-off has not been picked up. </p> <p> Mr Wadhwani's analysis is bound to raise a few eyebrows on the MPC. With oil prices rising and the claimant count measure of unemployment below 4%, there will certainly be those warning that there is a risk to inflation of leaving monetary policy too loose, particularly if the crutch of a high pound is knocked away. But he is right to point out the risks in the other direction. In the medium term an improvement in the growth-inflation trade-off could - with the right policy response - herald the start of a new golden age of full employment. But not if policy makers insist on fighting the battles of the past. Inflation in the UK excluding oil and petrol is 1.6% and prices of goods in the high street are falling. Japanese inflation is negative. There is little price pressure in Germany, and not a great deal - given the strength of the booming economy in the US.

In the documents the computer company makes it clear that suppliers will in future have to use a web system instead of mail or faxed orders and invoices. </p> <p>\"The ability to trade electronically has now become a prerequisite for being an IBM supplier and is of primary consideration in our supplier selection process,\" the memo to suppliers reads. </p> <p>IBM has created a software system for suppliers, which it claims will be simple for small businesses to use with a standard PC and internet connection. The computer company has offered training sessions for users and made clear that it would be a good idea for suppliers to turn up to the available sessions. </p> <p>\"Regrettably, missing this window would impact our ability to trade with you electronically and rescheduling has become extremely difficult due to the huge enablement effort under way,\" IBM warns suppliers. </p> <p>The new move to bring all IBM's suppliers into a simplified internet system was made because only 20% of suppliers were trading electronically with the company - although they accounted for about 80% of total business. </p> <p>The move is aimed at saving costs and increasing efficiencies for organisations. The company believes that the new system will be able to eliminate invoicing errors, which can lead to delays in payment. </p> <p>One supplier said: \"It is the way forward, you cannot be resistant to these things. Once you go through the training session it is obvious and it does speed things up. It is a much more efficient process, it cannot go wrong.\" </p> <p>In 1998 IBM had 5m paper invoices but with the new system this is being reduced to nearly zero. </p> <p>IBM said yesterday that internet dealing was now the \"preferred option\" but was not the only prerequisite for selection as a supplier. The company said the system was more efficient and transparent.</p>",
  "<p>The environment agency last night warned that the risk of pollution was a major problem facing hundreds of people returning to their flood-hit homes. </p> <p>Residents in Lewes, East Sussex, and people living in villages in the Maidstone area of Kent, spent yesterday mopping up as weather experts forecast more heavy rain in the early hours of tomorrow. </p> <p>With up to an inch of rainfall expected, the agency's environmental protection teams were checking sewage pumping stations, chemical stores, oil stores and farms, all of which were identified as possible sources of contamination. There were further warnings that electricity supplies might still be live despite the destruction. </p> <p>Several firefighters received minor shocks while pumping water away from properties. </p> <p>Jo Warburton, agency spokeswoman, said: \"All rivers affected are being tested for contamination and the agency is liaising with Southern Water and South East Water on supplies where drinking water may be at risk.\"</p>",
  "<p>Imagine having the opportunity to work within an organisation that has provided a dramatic home for many of the greatest actors of the past 150 years. And - as if walking in the footsteps of the likes of Laurence Olivier, Vivien Leigh and John Gielgud weren't enough - you get to eat your Pret sandwiches in a building that appears in the diaries of Queen Victoria, the journalism of Charles Dickens, the dramatic criticism of William Hazlitt and the music criticism of George Bernard Shaw. </p> <p>For an arts junkie, it looks like paradise. But is the day-to-day reality all free tickets to premieres, hobnobbing with the stars and as much free ice-cream as you can eat? Not quite, says Alice Holt, 28, who works behind the scenes as a development co-ordinator at the Old Vic, supporting the impresario chief executive Sally Greene. </p> <p>Holt's offices are situated within the Old Vic theatre itself, a stone's throw from the South Bank in London's Waterloo. Her enthusiasm is immediately apparent. \"No two working days are the same,\" she explains, from her converted dressing room of an office, complete with stage lights and a designer interior. Her offices do possess a touch of glamour, she confesses - the dressing rooms were designed by the likes of Stella McCartney and Vivienne Westwood. </p> <p>\"There is definitely a buzz of creativity emanating from here that makes for a frenetic but exciting working environment,\" she says. \"My schedule can be disrupted at any moment. My job consists of coordinating our fundraising activities, which involve many forms, and reporting back to Sally,\" Holt adds, citing a forthcoming literary lunch at the Ivy with Jackie Collins as an example. \"I also have to handle calls from corporate sponsors, and liaise with the company assisting us on guests and ticket sales.\" </p> <p>Holt's fascination with the arts stems from her degree studies in drama and English at Surrey University. \"I knew that I wanted to work in the arts in some capacity, but not on the stage itself,\" she explains. </p> <p>For her role, Holt insists that good communication skills, a cheerful disposition and the ability to think on your feet are essential. \"On the administration side, I type out mail-shots for distribution and reply to the regular letters that we receive. People often write to congratulate individual actors and the production team, which is great for morale. The myth of free tickets and goodies is not a reality, however, because we have to run the business at a profit; although I do keep abreast of our plays and see at least three in a season,\" she says, adding that it would be hard for someone to do her job if they didn't possess a passion for the arts. </p> <p>\"Even after a year, it's still a thrill to work among renowned actors. I've bumped into Helen Mirren and Simon Callow, and I've liaised with Stephen Daldry (director of the new film Billy Elliot) as he is on our board of trustees,\" says Holt. \"There is an element of glamour, but physically seeing actors is where it stops.\" </p> <p>What about the potential for nerves and stage fright to rub off onto the support staff? \"There's no doubt that after weeks of rehearsals, the imminence of the opening night spills over into panic,\" she admits, alluding to last-minute errors in ticket allocation, and banners not being up in time as some of her regular headaches. \"As a team, we feel an inevitable sense of triumph once the opening night has passed, and the after-show parties make it all worthwhile,\" she says with a smile. </p> <p>There have been big changes at the Old Vic in recent years. \"I do feel privileged to work alongside a woman with as much willpower and energy as Sally,\" says Holt, pointing to Greene's work with the Old Vic Trust, which saved the building from being turned into a lap-dancing club, among other suggestions, by buying it for \u00a33.5m. Holt's schedule has certainly upped in pace since the Oscar-winning star of American Beauty, Kevin Spacey, pledged to perform at the Old Vic in order to attract great writers, actors and directors back to the theatre. Greene has assembled a board of directors, including Dame Judi Dench, which will see Spacey acting as a consultant. \"I personally saw Spacey when he flew to London in July and needless to say I was extremely excited,\" says Holt. \"We have a lot of work ahead of us, but we like working hard and playing hard.\"</p>",
  "<b> Age:</b> 71. <p> <b> Appearance: </b> deconstructed - open shirt, mussed-up white hair. </p> <p> <b> Style:</b> deconstructed. \"A collage of abstracting fragments and pieces of the puzzled urban environment,\" says the Architecture Encyclopedia. </p> <p> <b> He does buildings, then? </b> Arguably the most significant one of the last century, more famous than the art it houses and a huge hit with the public. </p> <p> <b> Tate Modern? </b> The famously rationalist structure designed by Herzog and de Meuron? Have you been listening? </p> <p> <b> So, it's ... </b> the Guggenheim in Bilbao, a lolloping structure so beautiful that it caused one critic to weep \"repeatedly\". He was also behind the Gehry House in Santa Monica, a clapboard residence encased in a metal slipcover. </p> <p> <b> That's just typical of these architects. I mean, who would live there? </b> Gehry does. </p> <p> <b> Anything else? </b> This year, he designed the Experience Music Project in Seattle, said to have been inspired either by broken electric guitars \u00e0 la Jimi Hendrix, or by a pile of trash outside his offices. It has no right angles. </p> <p> <b> He's never going to get anywhere with work that weird. </b> \"I never thought I'd get this, because I thought my work was weird,\" said Gehry, as he collected a Gold Medal from the American Institute of Architects last year. He might be similarly surprised when he's presented with the RIBA Royal Gold Medal on Wednesday. </p> <p> <b> Hang on - is this some kind of world exclusive? </b> Hardly; he's known about the gong since May. But his sentiments might be stirred by the fact that the bash is being held at the Banqueting House in Whitehall, designed by Inigo Jones in the Palladian style. </p> <p> <b> And? </b> \"Palladio faced a fork in the road and he took the wrong turn.\" In other words, it's all straight lines and sobriety - very un-Gehry. </p> <p> <b> Is that some kind of architect's joke? </b> Very possibly. </p> <p> <b> Do say: </b> \"The medal? We fashioned it out of old tap washers.\" </p> <p> <b> Don't say: </b> \"What will the building look like when it's finished?\"</p>",
  "<p>Chevron is expected to announce the takeover of its rival, Texaco, as early as today after the boards of the two US oil groups met yesterday afternoon. </p> <p>The deal is likely to be structured as an all-share transaction valuing the combined group at about $90bn (\u00a362bn). By combining two of the largest US companies, the merger further consolidates a global industry already dominated by a handful of huge corporations. </p> <p>Analysts yesterday expressed surprise at the timing of the merger, given the proximity of next month's presidential elections and the turmoil in the oil market. Consumer groups in the US have raised objections to further consolidation in the industry because of fears that it would increase prices. </p> <p>The last wave of consolidation, which saw the marriage of Exxon with Mobil and BP with Amoco, started two years ago at a time when oil prices were a third of their present level. </p> <p>Chevron and Texaco are expected to announce cost savings of as much as $1bn as a result of their merger. </p> <p>Based on Friday's closing share price, Texaco was valued at $30.4bn, compared with $55bn for San Fransisco-based Chevron. </p> <p>A combined Chevron/Texaco is likely to have to divest itself of certain assets in order to win anti-trust approval in the US. Chevron would also have to unravel a joint venture with Shell.</p>",
  "Boasting six bedrooms and a spectacular view of a remote stretch of coast, Blue Beach Lodge sounds a snip at \u00a3130,000. <p>The only drawback is that it is a bit of a trek - an 8,000-mile trek to be precise - for a family keen to purchase a bolthole away from the grime and bustle of British city life. </p> <p>Blue Beach Lodge is on the west coast of East Falkland overlooking the first landing place of British troops during the 1982 war and near the military cemetery. </p> <p>But so keen are the islanders to attract the \"right type\" of owner that they have placed an advert in The Caterer And Hotelkeeper, a paper aimed at the British hotel trade. </p> <p>Originally two farmhouses, the lodge at San Carlos was used to billet soldiers from 2 Para during the conflict. Its owners, William and Lynda Anderson, turned it from a farm house into a guesthouse in 1987. At first the spot was only accessible by four-wheel drive or by boat but now has a proper road. </p> <p>Visitors began to arrive to view both the site of the landings and to pay their respects at the cemetery. The Falklands' booming population - it has risen by more than 10% to 2,500 thanks largely to oil exploration projects and fishing deals - has also helped boost visitor numbers. </p> <p>The Andersons have now decided to retire, leaving a vacancy for a guesthouse owner, preferably one who can cope with the isolation - the permanent population of San Carlos is six - and the harsh weather. As well as the six guest rooms, the lodge has a residents' lounge and bar and dining room. </p> <p>Richard Baker, acting general manager of the Falkland Islands Development Corporation, said: \"We don't normally advertise overseas. It is not generally feasible to expect buyers from 8,000 miles away in the UK.\" Mr Baker joked that the six-strong population made San Carlos \"quite a big settlement for us\". </p> <p>A glance at the Lonely Planet Guide, however, might put off prospective buyers. It says: \"In an age of global access, it is nice to know there are still a few travel destinations where you can go your whole visit without bumping into a tourist.\" </p>",
  "Paul Brown makes many good points about Britain's appalling waste problem, (What a waste\", October 11), but he fails to explore one avenue that would stop us having to send so much rubbish to landfill or incineration in the first place - namely reducing the rubbish we actually put in our bins. <p>The rubbish in the average household bin in Britain weighs about 16 kilos, roughly the same weight as a three-year-old child. Approximately 40% of that rubbish consists of glass, kitchen and garden waste - materials that could easily be composted. If local councils offered residents composters at a drastically reduced price, as Stoke-on-Trent city council did recently, think of the difference it would make to Britain's waste mountain. Residents without space for a composter could be encouraged to use wormeries that are small and relatively cheap to buy. </p> <p>The public also need to become far more actively involved in solving the problem, by changing their shopping habits and buying greener. They could also be more imaginative about re-using items, by donating old clothes, CDs, cartridges, printers and spectacles to charity. These may sound like simplistic suggestions but they might just be the answer to Britain's burgeoning waste problem. In a recent experiment we did in Bristol, one family managed to reduce its rubbish by 80%, through encouragement and better information. Let's look at a pre-bin solution backed by government and councils - it has to be better than \"burning the waste or dumping it in landfill sites\".<br><b>Alan Woods<br>Chief executive, Going for Green</b> </p> <p>For the many thousands of householders who have been flooded and the millions whose premiums will be raised to cover the claims (Low lying homes may become uninsurable, October 14), it would be helpful if you printed the name of the minister who signed the letter to local authorities telling them that the decision on whether or not to allow planning permission to develop on flood plains was being left to the \"commercial judgment\" of the developer. </p> <p>The letter was one of the few stimulated by Michael Heseltine in his damp bonfire of red tape.<br><b>Ian Campbell<br>Borth, Ceredigion</b></p> <p>The complacency of the environment agency is bewildering. Within a month of \"flood action week\", one of the worst floods in recent history hits the south-east of England. Despite warnings from a range of expert scientific witnesses that flooding will get more frequent and severe, the EA still supports planning applications by landowners to build on flood plains. </p> <p>The agency's own flood week message: \"Flooding. You can't prevent it. You can prepare for it,\" is no cure for the incremental effects of flood plain development. Milton Keynes council, in a new town with acres of space already allocated for further expansion, has granted developers permission to build in the Ouse Valley flood plain. </p> <p>It is the same up and down the Ouse flood plain. Why does the environment agency believe it is wise to prepare for flooding by building on flood plains?<br><b>Richard Skellington<br>Milton Keynes</b></p>"
