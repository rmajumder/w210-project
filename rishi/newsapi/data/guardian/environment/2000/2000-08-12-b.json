  "<p>Do the Beckhams really have adjacent personalised toilets, Dennis Bergkamp a burning resemblance to the 'Boy with Seven-league Boots' in Ivo Caprino's animated fairytale, and Alfe Inge Haaland a passion for smoked mutton? According to companies leading the way in the booming online football diary business - we want to know - so much so that one of them, last week, offered David Beckham a \u00a31m advance for exclusive online access to his mind. </p> <p>In the last fortnight, hosts of existing UK diaries - Sportsnetglobal, Sportingidols and Icons (about to merge with the industry's aging Norwegian fore-runner, Sportprofile) - offered readers a varied diet. While David Ginola, Marc Overmars and Emmanuel Petit all used their diaries to announce multi-million pound transfers, young Alan Smith was penning a piece on his Leeds heritage, Erik Meijer revealed 'I have two bottles of alcohol in my room' and Lars Bohinen provided this insight into his leisure time: 'We've just had a well-deserved weekend off, during which I watched Formula One. It would appear to be quite popular to slam into Schumacher's rear end.' </p> <p>All of which is fine - as far as it goes. 'The content is undeniably banal', says Steve Nuttall, head of Sportal.com, who have so far decided against getting involved. 'The problem with the diary industry is there's very big money behind very little content.' </p> <p>Those backing the projects disagree. On one level, newsworthiness is readily manufactured. Sander Westerveld, Robbie Fowler and Alfe Inge Haaland have all provoked sensational press stories with indiscreet comments ('Damn this talk of fines!' wrote Haaland after his diary entry on the use of the words 'scum' and 'shit' in football provoked Leeds to take disciplinary action). But, inevitably, standard output tends more towards that of Patrick Berger, who spent 200 words of last week's entry discussing the weather. </p> <p>James Freedman, Chief Executive of Icons, says the future lies in aggregating what players have to offer. </p> <p>'Yes, footballers can be dull, and if we end up with pages of car wash anecdotes we won't succeed. But most players aren't like that. They are hugely enthusiastic about being able to take control of their image and talk directly, without the distortion or spin of the media. One hour after the Holland v Italy match in June, Frank de Boer was on the phone to us pouring his heart out. And Hassan Kachloul was here yesterday, telling us how he plans to write about Moroccan football, poverty and the Muslim faith. I'm not saying he's Melvyn Bragg, but it'll be interesting stuff.' </p> <p>Freedman hopes to have 60 players signed up by September, increasing the chances of a lively daily spread. Attention now is focussing on associated e-commerce schemes - where the fee mooted for Beckham's innermost thoughts begins to make sense. </p> <p>'The potential is enormous,' says Freedman. 'In terms on content, the diaries are really only chapter one of what we plan to offer. Commercially, this can be massive.' </p> <p>Japanese sites, rather longer established, have set up subscription diaries. Each of Hidetoshi Nakata's millions of followers pays $4.67 a month for access to his online diary ('It's a way for Nakata to show his gratitude to his fans,' suggests business manager Fujita Mina). But European fans, operators acknowledge, want to receive something more tangible for their money. Icons have begun auctioning shirts - Dennis Bergkamp's Euro 2000 top went for \u00a34000 - while Sportingidols, established by agent Jon Smith, has a com plex business plan. 'Players' existing sponsorship deals will take on a global dimension,' says Smith, 'opening up into, for instance, the lucrative Malaysian and Singaporean markets. Alongside this, we'll be merchandising, list-broking, content exporting, and looking at ISP and Wap provision - there's quite a lot planned.' </p> <p>But will the diaries be a strong enough foundation to keep the surfers coming? </p> <p>'That's the plan,' says Smith. 'The key principle of our site is that the players are the biggest shareholders. So in the simplest terms, the more interesting their diaries, the more they will earn. At the start it is likely to be tens of thousands - but in the longer term they could make huge sums.' </p> <p>Icons, Sportingidols and Sportsnetglobal - the big players - will go head to head later this year. The latter have begun taking on other top sportsmen - Brian Lara, Peter Scudamore and Johnny Herbert - to expand the genre, while sportingidols is relying on sheer weight of numbers: they hope to have 40 per cent of Premiership and Nationwide players in the bag by the end of the year. </p> <p>But is the world ready to peer into hundreds of footballers lives - including, mouth- wateringly, Alan Shearer's? </p> <p>'We're used to scepticism,' says Freedman. 'But we've got exclusive access and quality staff. Wait and see.' </p> <p><strong> David Ginola</strong> As for demanding his and hers Mercedes and a six-bedroom mansion, I can confirm that there is absolutely no truth in any of those ridiculous statements. All I did was to try and get a decent wage, again wildy exaggerated in the press, for having to leave Tottenham and uprooting to the Midlands. People have to appreciate that I did not anticipate any of this, having signed a three-year contract with Tottenham only 12 months ago.</p> <p> <strong> Patrick Colleter</strong> The web is a brand new way of communication. I find this technology interesting because it brings people closer together. Thanks to this medium, I am going to be able to share my feelings with you! To people here, English football is the best in the world. I find that amusing and surprising. </p> <p><strong> Robbie Fowler</strong> Considering my last update was only on Friday, it may seem strange that I have chosen to do another one so soon. That's because I have a good reason to. I couldn't believe the way some of the press on Saturday reproduced what I had written last time concerning Everton's signing of Paul Gascoigne ... If you want to know the truth, then you should believe what you read on my web page and not what you read elsewhere.</p> <p> <strong> Winston Bogarde</strong> The next step in my career is still undecided, but I suspect something might happen in the near future. My friends have told me this morning that my picture is on the back pages of some of the English newspapers. They are saying that I may be about to join Manchester United. That would be very nice. Marc Overmars announced his transfer on his website last week and I can promise all my fans that I'll do the same if the situation comes up.</p> <p> <strong> Pegguy Arphexad</strong> I have decided to open this personal and official website to keep in touch with all the people who are interested in my new adventure. I want to say to everybody, with a big smile: 'Hey, I am not dead yet!'</p> <p> <strong> Lars Bohinen </strong> The first A-team friendly has taken place. We played against Crusaders in a testimonial in Belfast. We managed 0-0, which is a good result when you go off to Europe to play.</p> <p> <strong> Veggard Heggem</strong> By visiting my website you will be supporting a good cause! I will donate part of my earnings to the Children's Clinic in the Trondheim Hospital and to the Marie Curie Centre here in Liverpool.</p> <p><strong> Thomas Myhre</strong> As far as card games are concerned, Trond Andersen and I toyed with, and at times humiliated, Kjetil Rekdal and Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r. After a couple of 'off days' with an unbelievably unjust distribution of good cards, we're now back in the driving seat. During these two days of 'poor hands', I began to wonder whether I hadn't dishonoured the daughter of the man who invented playing cards. </p> <p><strong> Dennis Bergkamp</strong> There's still a lot of talk about Marc and Manu's departures from Highbury. I think Arsenal fans should now just move on really and start to look ahead. These things happen ... It's not like someone has died or anything. </p> <p><strong> Marc Overmars</strong> Finally, the waiting is over. Today I will fly to Barcelona for a medical and to sign a five-year contract with Barcelona. My agent concluded the deal a few hours ago, which involves a \u00a325 million transfer fee. I'm so excited. But I obviously have mixed feelings. I'm also sad because I will be leaving so many wonderful guys at Highbury. Some of my former Arsenal team-mates don't even know about the move as I write this. I will give you more details later on today, for now, I need a rest.</p>",
  "<p>The secret of teams holding their own in the Premiership boils down mainly to this: are they able and willing to take financial gambles?</p> <p> The fact is that only a small number of clubs - the big city giants like Manchester United, Liverpool, Chelsea and Arsenal - are able to spend enough to virtually guarantee their survival at this level. When I look at the situation confronting the rest of us, I am instantly reminded of some kind of soccer casino in which six or eight clubs are playing at the \u00a3200 tables - while the others play at the \u00a32 ones.</p> <p> The formation of the Premiership in 1992 - and the mind-boggling TV deals it has attracted - has created an enormous gap between the top-flight teams and those in the Nationwide League. Hence the fact that most of the teams who have been promoted to the Premiership have struggled to make an impact and, indeed, half of them have gone straight back down the following season. Another illustration of this great divide concerns the ease with which Charlton, who were in the bottom three in the Premiership the season before last, won last season's First Division title.</p> <p> Yet a massive 'class' gap has also developed within the Premiership. For clubs like Charlton, not to mention my own club Coventry, the sort of transfer-market expenditure made by Liverpool's manager Gerard Houllier - \u00a355 million in 18 months - is daunting to the point of being almost frightening. The point is particularly pertinent in our case, given the close-season departure of three players - Gary McAllister, Noel Whelan and Robbie Keane - who were regarded as key men in our side.</p> <p> The sale of Keane to Inter was as disappointing to me as it was to our supporters. Ideally, the fee Inter were prepared to pay for Robbie would have meant less to us than what he could contribute in helping maintain Coventry's progress. But we have to live in the real world here - a world in which we are obliged to satisfy not just our supporters but also our bank. And the breaking point for a club at the top end of the financial league is rather higher than it is for one like Coventry. There is no point in complaining about this. As with all managers of clubs whose income is comparatively limited, I knew the score when I took the job and I look upon it as a challenge - and that challenge has unquestionably become more difficult.</p> <p> At one time, it was relatively easy to hold your own at the top through what I called 'survival' football - teams pushing up to the half-way line to squeeze the play and turning games into contests of physical power and determination. Teams could go far just by being physically strong and well organised.</p> <p> This is no longer the case. Teams have been forced to operate with greater depth, the result being that skilful players have had greater scope to express their ability. If anything sums up this change, it is surely the relegation of Wimbledon last season.</p> <p> For years, Wimbledon had been the guiding light for comparatively small, unfashionable teams. They epitomised the advantages of 'survival' football more forcibly than anyone - although even they had showed signs of gradually changing their approach at the time Joe Kinnear left the club and was replaced by Egil Olsen. I am not sure that Olsen fully appreciated the need for those changes. The Bosman ruling, which has opened the doors to so many foreign signings, is another reason why the onus on skill is more pronounced.</p> <p> The biggest clubs have long contained most of the best British footballers, but now they also have some of the best from the rest of the world. The Chelsea team of today, for example, is in a totally different class to the one I played against 10 years ago. This is another reason why the name of the Premiership game for the rest of the cast is 'survival.'</p> <p> We cannot afford to have expensive players sitting on the bench or playing in the reserves; we have to have them on the field in order to justify our outlay. Therefore, the survival secret also involves luck in terms of avoiding a lot of injury problems.</p> <p> Above all, though, the first thing you look at when assessing the chances of a newly-promoted team is their financial potential, especially their crowds.</p> <p> So it goes without saying that of this season's Premiership newcomers, Manchester City appear to have the best chance of surviving in their plush new environment.</p>",
  "<p>Confirmation that Celtic and Rangers will probably join a (largely) northern European league within two years is nothing more than the formal unwrapping of the present they bought themselves two years ago, when they led the top 10 clubs' secession from the Scottish Football League to form the SPL. </p> <p>Ever since the onset of satellite broadcasting, saturating football with previously inconceivable amounts of money for transmission rights, the Old Firm's ultimate objective has been to create an environment in which they would enjoy negotiating power similar to that which has enriched heavily populated countries such as England, Italy, Spain, France and Germany. </p> <p>The first step was to break from the SFL in order to rid themselves of the drag factor caused by the smaller clubs' power of veto against proposals that would be seen by the latter as serving only the interests of the giants. </p> <p>To effect a hasty departure a bribe had to be paid in the form of an increase in the annual share of TV money paid to the non-Premier clubs and a legally-binding pledge to allow another two members into the SPL from the start of this season. Hence the present nonsensical structure, in which the league will be split into two groups of six - one to contest the championship and Uefa Cup places, the others to fight the relegation issue - after 33 matches. </p> <p>The near-certainty that this would cause an imbalance of home and away fixtures - a 20-18 outcome one way or the other will be commonplace - was glossed over by the SPL hierarchy and it is now easy to see why. The Old Firm's decision to join clubs from Holland, Portugal, Belgium and Scandinavia - that is, given Uefa's sanctioning of the proposal - will allow the SPL to revert to a 10-team set-up. </p> <p>One other Scottish club will join the Glasgow pair in the new league, but the SPL will be made up to 10 once again merely by promoting one from the First Division of the SFL. All of this represents a volte-face on the part of Celtic and Rangers, who have insisted in the past that they would not desert the Scottish league. </p> <p>The Ibrox chairman, David Murray, admitted as much after Friday's meeting in Amsterdam - the latest in a series designed to achieve their ultimate objective - when he said: 'I'm changing my opinion. There is merit in the idea of Rangers and Celtic joining a new league if it can be worked out with Uefa.' </p> <p>The Old Firm cannot be blamed for attempting to create a league that will serve a catchment area with a population amounting to 59 million, giving them parity with such as England and Italy. It has long been obvious that even the huge supporter base and global merchandising of Celtic and Rangers does not compare with the money available from television. </p> <p>They have watched enviously as middle-to-lower order English clubs, with nothing like the drawing capacity or the merchandising potential of the Old Firm, have benefited from millions - in some cases matching the season-ticket money taken by the Old Firm - even before the start of a new season. </p> <p>If Celtic and Rangers are to be serious challengers to the leading clubs on the continent, they have to try something that will bring the TV people a-courting. Whether or not it will work is another matter. But the possible danger of alienating fans who still enjoy the traditional jousts with domestic opponents seems no longer to be an issue. </p> <p>The big clubs have demonstrated for some time now that the wishes of their supporters are at the back of the queue.</p>",
  "<p>Another of England's qualifying matches for football's 2002 World Cup could end up on pay-per-view television. </p> <p>It was this column that broke the news last week that u&gt;direct, the independent pay-per-view broadcaster, had scooped the live rights for England's match in Finland on 11 October, and the same company, unabashed by some of the strident criticism the deal has received, are not ruling out a bid for the match in Greece on 6 June next year. </p> <p>'We remain interested in all competitive games at all levels and that includes the game in Greece,' says Roger Hall, u&gt;direct's marketing manager. </p> <p>The away match against Greece is England's only remaining qualifier that still has to be bought by television, and the Greek FA are likely to find the agents who peddle these matches even more solicitous than usual after the sky-high deal brokered on behalf of the Finnish FA. </p> <p>Much will depend, though, on whether Global Sportnet, who were part of the chain that delivered the Finland game to u&gt;direct for a hefty \u00a33 million, are given the task of placing the match. Two other agents, CSI and Ufa, are also seeking the business. </p> <p>Ufa have just acquired England's qualifier in Albania next March for Channel 5, and might do the same with the Greece match if they were appointed agents. </p> <p> <strong> England's World Cup qualifiers</strong> </p> <p>Who's showing what live </p> <p><strong> 7 Oct</strong> v Germany (H) Sky </p> <p><strong> 11 Oct</strong> v Finland (A) u&gt;direct </p> <p><strong> 24 Mar</strong> v Finland (H) Sky </p> <p><strong> 28 Mar</strong> v Albania (A) Channel 5 </p> <p><strong> 6 Jun</strong> v Greece (A) tbd </p> <p><strong> 1 Sep</strong> v Germany (A) BBC/Sky </p> <p><strong> 5 Sep</strong> v Albania (H) BBC/Sky </p> <p><strong> 6 Oct</strong> v Greece (H) BBC/Sky </p>",
  "<p>Working Thailand for a month, at times I imagined I could speak Thai. I was in Bangkok to photograph an emergency crew, who waited on the city's streets for road accidents to happen. None of them could speak English. So we communicated in sign language, spiced with a curious vocabulary. </p> <p>On my first morning someone said something like this, enhanced with guttural sounds that I could not understand but which were clearly directed at me: 'Libapoo, libapoo, number one, number one.' I nodded. That seemed to please the crew, and someone else had another crack at conversation: 'Mahkal oh-wan, fa, number one.' Then one guy screwed up his face and said, 'Anal-aka, overpaid, Spain, Spain.' For a second I thought I had been blessed with the gift of tongues. But as I followed his hand pointing south out of Bangkok towards a generic Spain, I grasped the idea: these people were fluent in English football. </p> <p>During the next month I learned nothing about my hosts' lives outside work except that 18 of the 32 were Liverpool fans, 10 supported Manchester United, and the rest a variety of other clubs including Leicester City and Charlton. </p> <p>The hospitals we saw were also full of Premier League fans. On one quiet evening in the Accident and Emergency ward, no fewer than five patients came in wearing Liverpool FC gear. The doctor sewing one of them up downed tools and danced about the ward because his pager had told him that Arsenal had beaten Chelsea 2-1. </p> <p>It turned out that these were not isolated incidents. Every Saturday night around six million Thais sit down to watch a match live from an invariably inclement England. The sport even affects Bangkok's notorious traffic jobs. 'It's a great benefit to the gridlocked streets in the centre,' says Lieutenant Colonel Wonglee of the Royal Thai Police. 'And big matchdays make our job considerably easier as the streets can be, by Bangkok's standards, deserted. People stay at home and watch. They don't drink and then drive.' </p> <p>The experience of watching a match in Thailand is curious because the British commentary can be heard beneath the Thai. Often words are lifted from the English version to embellish the Thai, such as 'foul', 'slice', 'ref', 'dive,' and, inevitably, 'Goal!' Whole phrases are borrowed too: 'on the right,' 'would you believe it,' and 'oh my God.' These can evolve into peculiar Thai-English expressions like 'believe it, believe it' and 'my God, my God, my God!' I spent one entire match bemused by the constant refrain of 'you fuck up', until I grasped that it was a reference to the Uefa Cup. </p> <p>Why the Premier League? One reason is the Thai penchant for gambling. 'I've had a bad run on Chelsea in the League,' one friend told me. 'We've got to turn things around or I'll be broke by the rainy season.' Nearly all forms of gambling are illegal in Thailand, but they are almost impossible to stop as people transfer their winnings from bank account to bank account the day after the match. Gambling on matches abroad eliminates the fear that Thais may try and nobble players; unlike cricket and India. German football is perceived as boring and Thais assume the Italians do nobble players. Consequently it is estimated that 120 billion baht (over \u00a32 billion) is gambled by Thais on the Premier League every season. </p> <p>But the passion for the Premier League runs much deeper than gambling, as the unveiling of David Beckham's statue at the central Buddha monument in the Wat Pariwas temple in Bangkok suggests. His floppy topped image was carved on the lower slopes of the monument, in a position reserved for minor deities. Pakdee Nuntiwajrind of Thai's Channel 3, which broadcast Euro 2000, explains: 'He has single-handedly changed the profile of the football fan. An entire female audience has been attracted to the game by his looks and his personality.' Beckham's grinning features are plastered over everything in Thailand from buses to beer mats. He and Michael Owen are as important as cultural icons as Thai pop and soap stars. But their hold over the Thai audience is partly as emblems of the teams they represent. </p> <p>On the third floor of the Discovery Building in Bangkok, the 'Star's Soccer' shop sells every conceivable fanzine and football video and a plethora of team kits and posters. Beckham and Owen (and with them United and Liverpool) dominate the sales. Both Liverpool and United's official supporter's magazines appear in Thai. Liverpool recently went one further by translating the title of the magazine itself into Thai. Anek Yongkhord of the shop Star's Soccer explains: 'I think this was a deliberate attempt on the part of Liverpool supporters in the face of the rise of Manchester United to remind people of their loyalty - that Liverpool is Thailand's team.' </p> <p>Many Thais seem to believe that the Premiership, with its wealthy international stars, confers a global status upon those who follow it. As one fan put it to me, by supporting Liverpool, Thailand itself became a 'player'. He explained: 'In the past, when Liverpool won the Cup or league, there was a sense of national happiness, because as a nation we had won.' </p> <p>In Thailand's headlong rush through the boom and bust of the last fifteen years, one constant has been the ambition to be world-class, to match the developed world in some field. Premiership clubs can do this for you. By supporting Liverpool, some Thais felt instantly involved in a sophisticated western culture. Poor families in a Third World country could become honorary Englishmen, worrying about a forthcoming match with West Ham in exactly the same way as a merchant banker in The Chalfonts. Thais will often discuss the relative merits of stadia they have never visited or of weather conditions they have never experienced. </p> <p>Conversely, almost all are scathing about their own national side: 'Weak... unimaginative...skilless...not world class...' But late on a Saturday night, watching the English match live, they become world-class soccer fans. </p> <p>However, it would be wrong to assume that Thais support the England national team itself. Yongkhord said of the last World Cup: 'The vast majority supported Brazil, some Argentina, some Holland. We're not stupid. Supporting England would be like supporting Thailand. England won't be number one.'</p>",
  "You have one colleague who embarrassingly burst into tears rather too often. Another withdraws from confrontation at every opportunity, something which you eventually find drives you nuts. And you're sick and tired of the goodlooking smooth-talker from accounts who tells tall tales and whose anti-gay diatribe the other day just confirmed everyone's suspicions that he might have something to hide. It's enough to make you think about giving in your notice. <p>But these tiresome acquaintances are not in your workplace. They are appearing almost nightly on Channel 4's Big Brother, the programme where 10 handsome young men and women have been locked up for two months in a house in London's East End, but one is voted out each week. </p> <p>When the show launched with four million viewers, critics assumed it would be sex appeal that guaranteed its audience. In fact, we have been compelled by seeing the chilling way in which a randomly-selected group of people sets about destroying one another under the genteel guise of mutual co-operation. Sounds familiar? It's probably a workplace near you. </p> <p>The most frightening thing about the melodrama being played out in front of the Channel 4 audience - and talked about by millions more than admit to watching the programme - is its alarming similarity to the worlds in which we all live. Home, school, college and most of all work are environments in which we can often identify relatives, friends or colleagues whose apotheosis we now see on our television screens. </p> <p>'This is the ambulance effect,' explains Professor Cary Cooper, Britain's leading specialist in work relationships. 'You see potential disaster and you want to look. The biggest similarity of all that Big Brother possesses is to a workplace. After all, they are working, even if they don't do much, and also they are competing. </p> <p>'Work is just like a game; some people get promotion, some people get rejected and some people who don't get promoted will leave. We're learning from Big Brother who is perceived to be worthwhile and who will be retained. </p> <p>'That's just like the office. People chat at the coffee machine and talk about other people and their relationships. This programme actually allows you not just to hear those sorts of rumours secondhand.' </p> <p>However, in the Big Brother house - like too many workplaces - there is a much more sinister objective lurking beneath much of the residents' conversational veneer. Each is jockeying for someone else to be ditched. </p> <p>Julie Bower might have identified with Sada or Caroline, both now evicted from the house. If Bower had time to watch television. The 35-year old City analyst has been suing Schroder Securities for unfair dismissal. </p> <p>The picture Bower created of her erstwhile employers is one where large numbers of other people - most of them men - appear to have been engaged in undermining her confidence and professional standing while also conspiring to reduce her remuneration package. Her annual bonus was slashed to 'just' \u00a3125,000 while her colleagues, who routinely e-mailed each other unkindly about her, received up to \u00a3425,000. </p> <p>'Big Brother shows us an environment where people are uncomfortable with their roles,' said Angela Ishmael of the Industrial Society. 'It's exactly what's happening in lots of workplaces. When managers aren't able to manage relationships in a team, team power takes over. It is a classic bullying scenario too, and is becoming more and more common.' </p> <p>'Nick in Big Brother is marked as dishonest for not being open about plotting to get other people thrown out,' said Ishmael. 'But he is quite genuine in terms of his feelings for his colleagues. </p> <p>'The simple truth is that he will look after himself more than everyone else. He's just more rehearsed that the rest of them at manipulating people. But Caroline, who clearly isn't liked, will tell everyone exactly how she feels. </p> <p>'Even though that's quite aggressive, most people can identify with it. The sort of thing Caroline will be accused of is not caring for other people's feelings. The sort of bullying Nick gets involved in is not as confrontational as Caroline's approach, but people do realise afterwards that they are being manipulated. That upsets them.' </p> <p>When replicated in the workplace, it upsets millions of the rest of us too. Earlier this year, the Trades Union Council published research suggesting that almost half of Britain's workforce had 'witnessed' some form of workplace bullying. One in 10 reported being bullied in the previous six months. Thousands of people in Britain are already messaging self-help websites to make complaints about 'mobbing'. </p> <p>The concept, which originated in the United States, does not apply to the classic weak victim of an over-arching superior but to the desperate individual who feels isolated in a working environment after being invidiously singled out by colleagues. </p> <p>Dishonest gossip, lack of co-operation, unkind looks and sneers, the intolerance of dissent - all are now regarded by many American workplace psychologists as classic symptoms of 'mobbing'. And they are also, of course, all leitmotivs of the Big Brother household. </p> <p>'Big Brother appears to be a microcosm of work, just as work is a microcosm of society,' said Ishmael. </p> <p>'However, quite rightly people at work are starting to see what constitutes bullying and that there are boundaries. They are willing to put their hands up and say to other people this is what you are doing. That's exactly what we are identifying with the participants in Big Brother .' </p> <p>'What the programme also picks up on vividly is an almost adolescent need in these situations for conformity,' said Phillip Hodson of the British Association for Counselling. </p> <p>'It's that terrible fear of whether we're approved of, always worrying does my bum look big in this? So much of it is centred around trust. Do people say one thing to our face and another to our backs? Someone you think you trust is capable of damning you terribly.' </p> <p>In atmospheres like this, it is hardly surprising that victims of workplace bullying take an average extra seven days more off each year than their colleagues who are not bullied, losing 18 million working days a year to Britain's economy. </p> <p>'At its heart it goes to isolation,' said Professor Cooper. 'This sort of environment is all about politics with a small 'p', isolating certain people. They may be a threat to your promotion, or they may be about to discover how incompetent you are. </p> <p>'And you want to ensure that their influence is minimal, so you spread rumours so that their position is undermined. </p> <p>'Sometimes in this environment you will get at someone else by coalescing with a colleague as an ally against the third party to put them down. That goes on in lots of organisations. It may be to undermine them, or perhaps just because you don't like them.' </p> <p>Conflict at work is not new, but some of its current mani festations are certainly a by-product of recent economic change. While 30 years ago jobs were reasonably secure, now organisations dispose of people routinely. We are all expected to work for an organisation, but they don't have to work for us. </p> <p>'In that environment,' says Cooper, 'there is inevitably more politicing, not just for promotion but for survival. Sadly, nowadays there are fewer and fewer people who don't do the back-stabbing. </p> <p>'In a highly competitive world, the group in which we work is getting smaller and smaller. No jobs are for life any more. We have intrinsic insecurity, we're a disposable human asset. We've all become lean and mean. </p> <p>'When we watch Big Brother we're learning lessons at an unconscious level for use in our workplace. Is it any wonder that we're all entranced?' </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:ben.summerskill@observer.co.uk\">ben.summerskill@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>If your attitude to money is that of spendthrift, your are more likely to get into difficulty than if you are a miser. Changing your ways won't be easy. Brendan Fehily, national counselling manager with the Consumer Credit Counselling Service, says that about 20 per cent of clients drop out of debt recovery programmes within six months. 'But people who are committed after six months stay for quite a long period.' </p> <p>Those who complete a programme usually discover that they have extra money at the end of each month. 'We advise them to open an account and put money to one side.' </p> <p>The main reason that clients have got into difficulty is that they do not budget and often do not know exactly what their income is, let alone their spending. Income is no guide to whether someone will get into difficulty. Fehily recently dealt with a middle-aged couple who had \u00a3110,000 of debt, in addition to a mortgage of more than \u00a3100,000. The husband had taken early retirement but they still had a joint income of \u00a33,500 a month after tax. They had had to cut back on eating out, leisure activities and there was no more 'doting on the grandchildren'. </p> <p>Mary (not her real name) is in her late twenties and works in marketing earning \u00a332,000 a year. Despite this, she has been forced to reorganise her finances, consolidating a variety of debts into a \u00a310,000 loan. 'I make one debt payment of \u00a3200 toward the loan. American Express are the only ones who would give me a credit rating. It's my only credit card, which is always cleared at the end of the month by direct debit and is only used for convenience,' she says.'I know exactly what is in my account now. Half my income goes towards rent and loan repayment. A quarter goes straight to my credit card and I know that is the amount of convenience spending I have for that month. The remaining quarter divided into four is the amount of cash I can have each week. It works out at about \u00a310 a day and it'll be like that for the next four years. </p> <p>'My attitude has changed. If I get a bonus at the end of this year it will all go into reducing my loan.' </p> <p>People facing a crisis with debt obviously need to radically change their habits. </p> <p>For many, though, Paul Webley, professor of economic psychology at the Exeter University, says small changes over a long period are more likely to make a difference than a crash money diet. 'For example, you could set up a standing order to make sure there is money going out to pay for bills and car repairs.' </p> <p>Often the solution will be 'low-tech' - only taking a certain amount in your wallet when you go shopping, say. </p> <p><strong>Hitting the jackpot - without the dream going sour</strong></p> <p>Who wants to be a millionaire? </p> <p>Stories about sudden riches that make it into the news tend to concentrate on obscene excess, or post-affluent destitution. But a large number of people cope well with sudden windfalls - be it the lottery, pools, Premium Bonds, or an unexpected inheritance. By 11 July this year the National Lottery had created 1,006 millionaires. Elaine Thompson scooped \u00a32.7 million on the lottery in 1995. She gave a third to her brother. She and her husband Derek now run a luxury holiday accommodation business based around a former farm outside Lyme Regis. Their initial reaction was one of shock. 'We were scared the neighbours would get jealous, or the children would have a hard time at school,' said Elaine. 'We're very much in favour of state schools, so long as they provide a well-balanced environment. We didn't want to have to pull the children out and send them to a private school.'</p> <p>The couple lived in Basingstoke and for the first two years they carried on working in their existing jobs - Elaine worked part-time doing the payroll for a local garage and Derek, an accountant, worked for Motorola. They started looking for a business after 18 months. 'We wanted something that we could do together and would feel comfortable with.' Elaine believes her solid relationship with her husband, stable family life and the advice they accepted from Camelot all contributed to their successful acclimatisation to sudden wealth. 'We considered ourselves extremely lucky before the money came along. And we've always discussed everything together.'</p> <p>Elaine also believes the money has given her confidence. She now handles interviews and chat shows with aplomb. The couple have two children, aged 10 and 15, and the couple's aim is to see them settled in careers before they think of doing anything more adventurous with their money. 'I'm more interested in SATs and GCSEs than world cruises,' says Elaine.</p> <p>Both children have trust funds and will have access to some money when they reach 18 and then again at 21.</p> <p>'I spoil them at Christmas and birthdays, but I always have,' she added. 'I was from a single parent family, my father left when I was five, so I don't want them to have nannies and be away from me. They're not going to be children for ever.' </p> <p><strong>Who to call</strong></p> <p>National Debtline: 0645 500511 <br> Money Advice Association: 020 7489 7707<br> Consumer Credit Counselling Service: 0800 138 1111<br> The Bankruptcy Association: 01524 64305<br> Citizens' advice bureaux: local phone book</p> <p><strong>And where to go for help if the miser is in control:</strong></p> <p>IFA Promotion: 0117 971 1177<br> Financial Services Authority: 020 7676 1000<br> Society of Financial Advisers: 020 8989 8464</p>",
  "<p>Take two nations, the Italians and the Brits. Which would you say is more inclined to save and finds it easier to control their spending - the flamboyant Mediterranean race or the more phlegmatic northerners? If you incline towards a prudent UK, you'd be wrong. </p> <p>At last month's 25th Annual Colloquium of the International Association for Research into Economic Psychology in Vienna, a paper from Paul Webley of the University of Exeter flagged up national differences in attitudes to financial planning. </p> <p>Italians were more inclined to save and found it easier to control their spending than the Brits surveyed. But across the sample, higher income led to more saving. And whether one felt flush or cash-strapped compared to one's reference group was also a way of predicting behaviour. </p> <p>The conference, held jointly with the Society for the Advancement in Behavioural Economics, also heard papers on such diverse subjects as children's savings behaviour and how women select perfume brands. </p> <p>Even our relationship with our clothes isn't as simple as it looks. Portuguese research on the the expression of self in clothing consumption found that clothes are an intimate part of our lives and a way of expressing ourselves - with the brands we choose playing an important part. </p> <p>Consumer expenditure has been rising by a greater margin than income since 1996, according to Mintel's annual British Lifestyles report. </p> <p>Research questioning 1,958 adults about spending plans found top spending priorities were having a good holiday (46 per cent), followed by buying a new car (38 per cent), decorating /making minor home improvements (38 per cent) and buying something for the home (37 per cent). </p> <p>In the past 10 years, gross income has increased by 22 per cent in real terms. The average personal taxable income is now more than \u00a330,000 per household - a 12 per cent increase from 1989. </p> <p>The amount of consumer credit outstanding is \u00a3600 billion, equivalent to more than \u00a310,000 for every adult in the country. </p> <p>Home acquisition and household services remain the largest element of the expenditure mix, at 30 per cent of spend in 1999. Travel and finance are the next largest expenditure areas, accounting for 17 per cent each. These two areas have shown the most growth over the past decade, with entertainment a close third. </p> <p>Some 53 per cent of adults - 59 per cent of men and 48 per cent of women - view owning a car as important to their lifestyle. Some 38 per cent would buy a new car as a priority given long-term financial confidence. </p> <p>Clothing expenditure has shown the greatest growth in the personal goods sector, increasing by 54 per cent in real terms between 1989 and 1999 to just under \u00a328bn. This is true of men as well as women. </p> <p>Expenditure on male toiletries has risen by 79 per cent in the past 10 years, as younger male consumers want to smell good as well as look good. </p> <p>Just under \u00a360bn is spent on pensions, equivalent to \u00a32,150 per employed person, or 9 per cent of average earnings. Four out of 10 adults regard both life insurance and personal pensions as important.</p> <p><strong>What kind of money manager are you? </strong></p> <p><strong>Sensible-but-sad </strong></p> <p>As a child you shopped around for savings accounts, rejecting fluffy toys in favour of top interest. You started a pension in your early twenties and school fees planning as soon as you stopped using contraception. You aim to retire at 50 and know exactly how you'll finance it.</p> <p>Congratulations, you're a model of prudence. But you've probably also had a predictable, unbroken employment record. Would you cope if circumstances changed? You may also be missing out on experience today for the sake of safety tomorrow.</p> <p><strong>Modern-day miser </strong></p> <p>You won't identify with the Dickension miser, but the tendencies are there in the way you search through best-buy tables and check your Visa statement to see what exchange rate you paid on that cheap wine in Calais. Your habits may protect you from want, but could also be a source of family conflict.</p> <p><strong>Defiantly ignorant </strong></p> <p>You take pride in taking as little interest as possible in money. Worrying about the future is a waste of time and keeping track of your bank balance is for neurotics. You run a balance on your credit cards and never pay them off even though you think banks are a rip-off and part of the global capitalist conspiracy. There is nothing damaging about this approach in itself, but you will come unstuck if your income dries up. Your inability to face up to financial issues may also be difficult for partners to cope with.</p> <p><strong>Chaotic but comfortable </strong></p> <p>You earn enough to afford most everyday needs, and holidays, but sometimes lurch into the red. You looked for a cheaper mortgage once, but never got any further. You know you should have a budget, but it would be too tedious to work out what you spend on takeaways. You've no idea whether you are putting enough into your pension.</p> <p>You're in good company: much of the British population operates this way. The risk is that you'd find it difficult to cope if circumstances changed, and you'll get a shock when, at 50, you find it is too late to save for retirement at 55. The good news is that if you spend a few hours looking at what you spend, why and where, you're close to a balanced attitude.</p> <p><strong>Compulsive </strong></p> <p>You habitually spend on things you don't need. You don't always wear the clothes you buy. 'Shopaholics' are often dismissed as fashion victims, but their habits can be a symptom of psychological distress. If your spending is getting you into debt, seek help. If you can cope financially, think seriously about why you behave this way.</p> <p><strong>Delusions of grandeur </strong></p> <p>You have wealthy friends, and hate not keeping up. You want your house pristine, and why not? You can borrow on the equity in your house. But you could be in the grip of a delusion that has felled at least one internet start-up and many a financial fraudster: you have access to money, but you can't afford to splash it around because it is not really yours.</p> <p><strong>Thrill-seeker </strong></p> <p>You are interested in money - but only in making it quickly without robbing a bank. The internet provides the means by which financial thrill-seekers can indulge themselves in the stock market. But you may not amass riches long term. For thrills, try white-water rafting.</p> <p><strong>Too cautious by half </strong></p> <p>The thrill-seeker's alter ego, you may be shocked to realise that pensions and endowments are stock market investments. You're a natural saver and have more in the bank or building society than you'd ever need in an emergency. You're just too nervous for anything adventurous. But if you're saving for large expenses - putting children through university or paying for retirement - you need a less cautious approach.</p> <p><strong>Keep it simple</strong></p> <p>People on low incomes are probably more likely to be good money managers than the well off, according to Paul Webley, professor of economic psychology at Exeter University. </p> <p>Many people don't manage their money very well, but they don't need to. For others, things are so finely balanced that letting the children go swimming will throw them out. 'If you spend whenever you want to but have a steadily rising income, it is not a problem. A rising level of affluence means people can afford to be lax.'</p> <p>For more affluent people, counting pennies may be unnecessary, but setting aside money for a pension is a priority. Webley says that even here you do not necessarily need a huge level of financial planning. Once the direct debit is set up, you won't notice it.</p> <p>Webley's definition of a healthy modern-day attitude to money is to have a long-term view. You should consider, for example, how you will finance children through university.</p> <p>Having a wide and diverse collection of investments and insurance products does not necessarily mean you are a good money manager. Most advisers are familiar with clients who have a rag-bag of investments, often of poor value,and have no idea why they bought them. Other clients may have invested over-confidently, buying and selling too often and spending too much on charges. And some people fall prey to the exhortations of insurance companies to protect against every conceivable risk - from theft of garden gnomes to unnecessary credit protection.</p> <p>Advisers say that investors who do well have generally chosen a few, simple products with reasonable charges and good long-term records, and made few changes to their portfolios.</p>",
  "<b> Open up! Who are they?</b> <p>Part of Close Brothers, a 120-year-old merchant bank which was reorganised in 1974 and now takes in some 18 financial ventures in a loose, confederal structure. Close claims to be the only quoted company in the All Share Index to record 25 years of consecutive growth. </p> <p><b> Merchant banking? That's big ticket, so what's that to do with my few thousand?</b> </p> <p>Close has a unit trust arm. Nearly five years ago, it backed a team led by Marc Gordon who ran a niche operation at fund managers John Govett aimed at risk-averse investors.They wanted to make a bigger bang in the market than Govett was prepared to finance. So they moved to the merchant bank which provided the backing for Close Fund Management. CFM remains a small company employing a close-knit team. </p> <p><b> Are investors better off with a small company?</b> </p> <p>There's no easy answer to that but, so far, Close has avoided the politics and backstabbing that have broken up a number of bigger fund management firms. </p> <p> </p> <p><b> What do they offer?</b> </p> <p>It is better to start with what they do not sell. There are no traditional trusts based on concepts such as growth or income, themes such as technology or the environment, or the usual geographic sectors. Investors looking for these need to research elsewhere. </p> <p><b> So what do they do?</b> </p> <p>Protected funds are their big line. These gain when the market goes up but falls are minimised or completely non-existent when share prices slide. </p> <p><b> Sounds like the holy grail. What's the catch?</b> </p> <p>There's no such thing as a free lunch. Investors have to sacrifice part of the gains to avoid the pains. And the greater the protection, the lower the potential increases. </p> <p><b> What are the fund's called?</b> </p> <p>CFM labels them \"escalators\". The theory is investors would get bigger gains running up a ladder - until it topples over. The escalator never goes backwards. It has protected funds based on the UK and American markets. </p> <p><b> How do they work?</b> </p> <p>That's the hard bit. They use a technique known as \"cash and call\". They put most of the money into deposit accounts or similar vehicles and the balance into options which kick in if the market rises. The 100% UK Escalator can never go down; its 95% funds cannot fall by more than 5%. The price level is reset every three months. </p> <p><b> What if there are four consecutive falling quarters?</b> </p> <p>The 95% fund will fall by around 20%. But even the worst bear markets have periods of gains. And in any case, a non-protected fund would probably fall substantially as well in similar conditions. </p> <p><b> Aren't there other protected funds?</b> </p> <p>Yes. But CFM reckons its technique is less costly and more transparent. There is no cap on gains, unlike other funds which keep profits above a certain level, so CFM is not making money by betting against its own clients. Nor is there a time limit on holdings -you can sell after a day or hold on for years. But perhaps the biggest competition comes with-profits bonds which Close decries as totally opaque. </p> <p><b> Are protected funds the CFM be-all and end-all?</b> </p> <p>No. <b> </b> There's also two UK index tracking investment trusts; Beacon, an investment trust specialising in alternative investment market companies; a venture capital trust; and an index tracking techMark fund.<b> </b> The AIM fund has been a top performer. </p> <p><b> Is there a fund manager style?</b> </p> <p>No and yes. The protected funds buy derivatives - futures and options that replicate an index. Rival funds buy real shares so they can qualify as Isas but Close believes isability is a marketing gimmick and that active management increases risk when purchasers want to dampen potential problems. But CFM reckons its style lies in marrying fund management with derivatives, while competitors specialise in one or the other. </p> <p><b> How much are the funds worth?</b> </p> <p>CFM controls \u00a3650m. </p> <p><b> Is there a website?</b> </p> <p>Yes. Just click on to <a href=\"http://www.closefm.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.closefm.com</a> - it's basically a brochure. </p> <p><b> What's the unique selling proposition?</b> </p> <p>Satisfying demand in a unique and innovative form.</p>",
  "The boundless imagination of mobile phone mast erectors reached new heights yesterday, with a planning application to hide one of the controversial antennae on top of a cathedral. <p>Camouflaged as a flagpole, with four receptor dishes hidden in the bell chamber below, the mast would relay chirruping signals between mobiles across the flatlands of East Anglia. </p> <p>Permission would also bring pennies from heaven for Norwich's Roman Catholic community from the phone company One 2 One, along with possible quips from the pulpit about direct lines to God. But the proposal has also triggered the fears which dog all mobile masts on the grounds of scientific uncertainty about their health effects. </p> <p>In spite of the parapet and gargoyles at the cathedral, the Labour MP for Norwich North, Ian Gibson, signalled an immediate protest campaign against the alleged menace on high. </p> <p>\"Whether it's stuck on top of a church, a school or the British Legion hall,\" said the MP, who is also a cancer specialist, \"people should be exempt from the hazards associated with these masts. The public do not want them in their environment and we would ask the church authorities to respect that.\" </p> <p>Local residents have also come up with a range of unholy adjectives from \"horrible\" to \"really cheeky\", but the diocese of East Anglia is keen to promote the positive side. </p> <p>\"Norwich has already got five or six phone masts, and a more modern one in this position would replace them,\" said Paul Maddison, the cathedral administrator. </p> <p>\"It is true that we would receive income from One 2 One, but there would actually be a reduction in the number of masts locally. We would also be able to fly a flag on the cathedral for the first time - the cross of St George, not One 2 One's.\" </p> <p>Gill Kerr of One 2 One said that the company was \"completely satisfied\" that its masts were safe, and that it tried to be locale-friendly by using existing buildings rather than putting up new structures.</p>",
  "Architects yesterday urged the government to give them a formal role in deciding planning applications for new buildings as part of a fundamental overhaul of Britain's \"arcane\" planning laws. <p>The president of the Royal Institute of British Architects, Marco Goldschmied, criticised the present planning laws as \"arcane\" for allowing people with \"no knowledge of good design\" to submit and approve applications for new buildings. </p> <p>He said architects should be given a statutory role in planning, which would allow them to help developers create a \"design-led holistic culture of community-based, integrated, environmentally-viable buildings\". </p> <p>The new proposals published yesterday are part of a campaign by the organisation, which represents most of Britain's 30,000 architects, to be launched this autumn, calling for a \"fundamental overhaul\" of the UK's planning system. </p> <p>The institute called for a change in planning guidance \"to encourage the use of architects in the design process\" and for qualified architects to sit on all local authority planning committees, to offer their expertise and guidance on proposals for new buildings. </p> <p>Among other key proposals by RIBA were for the government to make more use of public architectural competitions before deciding on design of new developments. </p> <p>The institute also urged ministers to set up a commission constantly to review the mechanisms for planning procedure and to remove the anomalies that \"inevitably\" arose. The proposals come in the wake of the recent criticism of ministers by Lord Rogers of Riverside, the Labour peer and leading architect, over the government's failure to implement his recommendations for urban regeneration contained in last year's Urban Task Force report. </p> <p>Jonathan Labrey, the head of government relations at RIBA, said: \"Architects should sit on all local planning committees from the earliest stages to help create the sort of housing that people actually want to live in.\" </p> <p>A spokesman for the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions said: \"Architects are not currently statutory or non-statutory consultees in the planning process and they would need to make a case as to why they should be included on either basis.\"</p>",
  "<p>Every evening this week two stories about the environment have been juxtaposed on our television screens. One has to do with a surplus of water. In Assam, four weeks of rain, ahead of the monsoon season, have devastated huge areas, making some 5m people homeless. The other comes out of the American west, from Montana, and the states around it. Here the problem is the reverse: prolonged drought, with little immediate hope of alleviation. </p> <p>Fires are raging which cannot be quelled, only diverted. Some 20,000 people, including large contingents from the armed forces, are doing their best to manage this catastrophe; but they are losing. Some 70 major fires are ravaging states from Texas to California. Whole communities are being evacuated by families who fear they may never return. Unless the weather changes there is little hope of relief. </p> <p>What is happening in Assam is an unmitigated disaster. What is happening in the west of the USA, though wrecking the lives of thousands and imposing costs which may run into billions, has at least one mitigating circumstance. It may be forcing on Americans, from the highest levels of government downwards, a new sense of urgency about environmental threats which for years they have contrived to ignore. Scenes from the stricken subcontinent have played on their TV screens , as on ours, over and over again, along with the warnings of experts that until the world came to recognise their significance and acknowledge the threat of global warming, such disasters could only continue and increase. </p> <p>But Montana and its neighbours are not the other side of the world: they are part of the USA. And the freak conditions which have sparked these fires have been replicated this year all over the country. On the eastern seaboard, hot seasons have turned eerily cold; it has rained as if the law of averages had been suspended. This disruption of their climate is producing an equal and necessary disruption of the fatally complacent attitudes which Americans have continued to display towards looming environmental catastrophe, while other developed nations, Britain included, began to wake up to them. </p> <p>That change was detectable, even before this disaster, in the growing awareness and willingness of great industrial corporations to acknowledge that these problems are real. It is evident in the way that oil companies, which until recently behaved as if environmental disturbance had nothing to with them, have begun to refashion their images as providers of energy in its broadest and sometimes its greenest sense. The expensive new advertising campaign by BP and its new associates, Amoco, Arco and Castrol, is a case in point. Green is their chosen colour; minimising emissions of conventional fuels and a whole new emphasis on solar power, are their message. BP, they now want us to accept, stands for \"Beyond Petroleum\". </p> <p>All this will take a very long time to turn round. Only last month, Washington admitted that it could not meet the legally binding targets for the reduction of greenhouse gas agreed at Kyoto in 1998. Its only hope of meeting those targets was to purchase what amounts to the right to pollute from other less prosperous nations. At that time, the official message seemed much what it had been over the past decade. If sacrifices are needed, others must make them; however grave the implications, we do not intend to let them alter our life styles. This week, America's viewers, watching the flames over Montana, may have started to think again.</p>",
  "<p>So at last the Bank of Japan gets its name on the G7 scorecard. After threatening to put one in the back of the net since April despite fierce opposition from the government, the bank's policy board has, by an undisclosed majority, finally voted to increase the cost of borrowing from zero to 0.25%, the first upward move in 10 years. </p> <p>At the end of a week of bad tempered exchanges with ministers the bank's governor Masaru Hayami no doubt feels empowered to be back in the global interest rate game after 18 months of doing nothing. With his counterparts in the US, continental Europe and Britain all having tightened monetary policy several times since the beginning of the year, he must have felt left out. By moving yesterday, Mr Hayami has also, within the narrow confines of the domestic political debate, won an important victory over vote-hungry ministers. </p> <p>Considering that the law granting the Bank of Japan's independence is little more than two years old, the latter is not an unimportant consideration. However, there is a very real risk that the bank will ultimately be proved to have scored an own goal. While in the short term achieving his long-held philosophical ambition of ending the zero interest rate policy, Mr Hayami, who thinks it encourages moral hazard and hurts pensioners reliant on interest income, may have unwittingly hampered what is still a very fragile economic recovery and, in doing so, sowed the seeds of his and Japan's downfall. It is undoubtedly true that the outlook for the Japanese economy is improving. Capital expenditure is rising and so too is company profitability. But that is largely due to the buoyancy of global demand. The domestic economy, by contrast, is still connected to a life support system of government spending. </p> <p>Consumer spending remains subdued and the collapse last month of the Sogo department store group highlights the fact that the financial system is still riddled with bad debts. </p> <p>Both the direct and psychological impact of a rate rise before a self-sustaining recovery has taken hold could prove damaging. With inflation still in negative territory, there was simply no need to tighten monetary policy now. Far better to wait until the signs of recovery were visible. The International Monetary Fund was less than enthusiastic, too. Mr Hayami's unspoken aim was probably to spur the government's flagging efforts at badly needed economic reform. But with a mandate of maintaining price stability, that is none of his business. He may be riding high in his own opinion now, but if Mr Hayami is to convince everyone else of the wisdom of his judgment he must hope that Japan's economic performance sparkles from now on. </p> <p><strong> Bank watch </strong><br> </p> <p> While the debate rages over whether the Bank of Japan was right to raise interest rates equity investors will be looking at those central banks, the US, Britain and Europe, which change their borrowing costs rather more often than their counterpart in Tokyo. There is an argument that one factor weighing on investor sentiment is the worry that interest rates may not have peaked and that stock markets on both sides of the Atlantic will remain below their best until the issue is resolved. </p> <p>Yesterday provided some evidence in favour of the interest rate overhang argument. The latest US data was not seen as increasing the pressure on the Fed to tighten the monetary screw another notch. So the Dow Jones squeezed a three figure gain yesterday, managing to top the 11,000 level. The figures do not definitively end the debate, which will continue to rage too in Britain and mainland Europe for some time to come. Investors may have a while to wait yet before getting the green light for another break upwards. </p> <p><strong> Price of success </strong><br> </p> <p> Celtic's message to its fans yesterday was written in bold green letters: if you want success, you will have to pay for it. </p> <p>The club's warning that ticket prices will rise was a harsh reminder of the cost of competing at the highest level. Transfer fees of more than \u00a310m are becoming almost routine and supporters, ultimately, foot the bill. </p> <p>This is particularly the case when things go wrong - as they have at Celtic, where the team struggled last season under Kenny Dalglish and John Barnes. Having invested heavily in new players, the club crashed out of the Uefa Cup and failed to reap returns in prize money and television payments. The ultimate losers, both financially and otherwise, are the fans. </p> <p>The club has traditionally kept its prices well below the national average and it has been well rewarded - with the highest season ticket sales in Britain. However, that friendly policy looks dated, particularly if the management gets its way and takes the club into a European super-league.</p>",
  "Campaigners for ramblers' rights today stepped up the pressure on the government not to abandon the countryside bill with a poll showing that eight out of 10 people support the legislation. <p>The Ramblers' Association published an NOP poll showing that 82% of those questioned believe the government should ensure the countryside bill, which is designed to protect threatened wildlife and the rights of ramblers, becomes law as soon as possible. </p> <p>The poll of 1,000 people follows reports last week that senior ministers are considering moves to abandon the legislation because of the massive backlog of bills which must be cleared through the Lords in this parliamentary session. </p> <p>Environmentalists fear the countryside bill, which has had more than 300 amendments from Tory peers to restrict access to their land, will be sacrificed to enable other important bills - on election spending, freedom of information, policing in Northern Ireland, criminal justice and transport - to be completed. </p> <p>But Kate Ashbrook, who has led the Ramblers' Association's right to roam campaign, said: \"The British public has consistently supported the government's election pledge to increase environmental protection and introduce a freedom to roam. It would be a tragedy if the government let this legislation fall by the wayside.\" </p> <p>A spokeswoman for the Wildlife and Countryside Link, an environmental umbrella group including Friends of the Earth and the National Trust, promised to \"fight to the last hedgerow\" to get the bill passed. </p> <p>And Labour MP Gordon Prentice said it was \"inconceivable that such a popular bill could be lost\" because of a lack of parliamentary time. </p> <p>The bill has the strong backing of both the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, and the environment minister, Michael Meacher. But the pressure on the legislative timetable means that it will be difficult to steer through more than five major bills still in the upper house before the start of the next parliamentary session. </p> <p>Ministers have ensured that detailed consideration of the legislation is timetabled for early October, in the middle of the party conference season, to increase the political pressure on the Lords not to go against the public mood. </p> <p>Tory peers, backed by the Countryside Alliance, have tabled numerous amendments to restrict the land available to ramblers, and prevent night-time rambling. Landowners want ramblers to be obliged to keep dogs on leads, and compensation for damage caused by ramblers.</p>",
  "<p>Greenpeace has challenged the government over the legality of the latest batch of farm trials of genetically modified crops saying that planning permission is required for the trials since they are technically scientific research and in law this is a change of use from farming. </p> <p>Greenpeace says the planting of this winter's batch of 15 GM oil seed rape trials would be unlawful unless planning permission is sought from the local authorities in each case. John Prescott, the deputy prime minister, and Nick Brown, the agriculture minister, have been told by letter that they have 14 days to reply or risk court action. </p> <p>Greenpeace has asked the government to confirm that it will cease all preparations for the farm scale trials of GM winter oil seed rape, at least until proper planning permission has been obtained. </p> <p>The Greenpeace case has arisen out of a judgment in 1965 when Judge Carey Evans held that if land was used for growing crops for research purposes it was not an agricultural use and planning permission was needed. The Department of the Environment takes comfort from the fact that West Dorset district council has considered the legal issue because of crop trials in their area at Over Compton. Councillors came to the conclusion that planning permission was not necessary. </p> <p>However, officially yesterday the government was not com menting on whether planning permission was necessary. It said each council must make its own decision. The secretary of state was not prepared to comment on a case that might come before the courts. </p> <p>In a written answer to a parliamentary question, Lord Whitty, an environment minister in the Lords, said on July 26 that the government was unable to give an authoritative interpretation of the legislation, adding that it was a matter for the courts. </p> <p>The case which may become central to the issue was brought by Dow Agrochemicals Ltd against a tenant farmer in Norfolk in 1965. Judge Carey Evans concluded that: \"Where nothing whatsoever is grown for use by man or beast, nor for use on the land to improve it or manure it, nor for sale, it is impossible to say the fact that crops along with weeds and grasses are grown for purely research purposes is enough to make the use of the land in question agricultural.\" </p> <p>Greenpeace campaigner Jim Thomas said: \"The decision to ignore the planning law demonstrates the government's breathtaking arrogance. They are already ignoring the rejection of GM technology by citizens and consumers - as well as the risk of genetic contamination.\" </p> <p>If Greenpeace continues with its action, it will coincide with the trial of its executive director, Peter Melchett, and 16 volunteers on charges of criminal damage for destroying GM trial crops due to begin in September.</p>",
  "<p>August of our first summer in France was spent in La Teste sur Mer, a tiny oyster village on the Bassin d'Arcachon in the Gironde. We stayed with my aunt, Tante Jeanne, and my uncle, Oncle Gustav, in the same white stuccoed house where my father had summered as a boy. Tante Jeanne was a frumpy, bespectacled, slightly smelly old woman; Oncle Gustav, a geezer in coveralls and beret who smoked hand-rolled cigarettes until they disappeared on to the tip of his tongue. Little had changed about La Teste in the years since my father had vacationed there. The neighbours were still all oyster fishermen. Their families still raised rabbits and grew tomatoes in their backyards. Houses had two kitchens, an inside one and an outdoor \"fish kitchen\". There was a hand pump for drinking water from a well, and an outhouse by the rear of the garden. </p> <p>My brother and I were reasonably happy here. The beaches were warm, there were lizards to hunt down and exterminate with readily available p\u00e9tards, firecrackers, which one could buy legally (!) over-the-counter. There was a forest within walking distance where an actual hermit lived, and my brother and I spent hours there, spying on him from the underbrush. By now I could read comic books in French and, of course, I was eating - really eating. Murky brown soupe de poisson, tomato salad, moules marini\u00e8res, poulet basquaise (we were only a few miles from the Basque country). We made day trips to Cap Ferret, a wild, deserted and breathtakingly magnificent Atlantic beach with big rolling waves, taking along baguettes and saucissons and wheels of cheese, wine and Evian (bottled water was at that time unheard of back home). A few miles west was Lac Cazeaux, a fresh-water lake where my brother and I could rent p\u00e9dalo watercraft. We ate gaufres, delicious hot waffles, covered in whipped cream and powdered sugar. The two hot songs of that summer on the Cazeaux jukebox were Whiter Shade Of Pale by Procol Harum and These Boots Were Made For Walkin' by Nancy Sinatra. The French played those two songs over and over again, the music punctuated by the sonic booms from French air force jets that would swoop over the lake on their way to a nearby bombing range. </p> <p>When our neighbour, Monsieur Saint-Jour, the oyster fisherman, invited my family out on his penas (oyster boat), I was enthusiastic. </p> <p>At six in the morning, we boarded Monsieur Saint-Jour's small wooden vessel with our picnic baskets and our sensible footwear. He was a crusty old bastard, dressed like my uncle in ancient denim coveralls, espadrilles and beret. He had a leathery, tanned and windblown face, hollow cheeks, and the tiny broken blood vessels on his nose and cheeks that everyone seemed to have from drinking so much of the local Bordeaux. We put-putted out to a buoy marking his underwater oyster parc, a fenced-off section of the bay bottom, and we sat . . . and sat . . . and sat, in the roaring August sun, waiting for the tide to go out. The idea was to float the boat over the stockaded fence walls, then sit there as the boat slowly sank with the water level, until it rested on the basin floor. At this point, Monsieur Saint-Jour would rake the oysters, collect a few good specimens for sale in port, and remove any parasites that might be endangering his crop. </p> <p>There was, I recall, still about two feet of water left to go before the hull of the boat settled on dry ground and we could walk about the parc. We'd already polished off the Brie and baguettes, but I was still hungry, and characteristically said so. </p> <p>Monsieur Saint-Jour, on hearing this - as if challenging his American passengers - inquired in his thick Girondais accent if any of us would care to try an oyster. </p> <p>My parents hesitated. I doubt they'd realised they might have actually to eat one of the raw, slimy things we were currently floating over. My little brother recoiled in horror. </p> <p>But I, in the proudest moment of my young life, stood up smartly, grinning with defiance, and volunteered to be the first. </p> <p>And in that unforgettably sweet moment, that one moment still more alive for me than so many of the other \"firsts\" that followed - first sex, first joint, first day in high school, first published book - I attained glory. Monsieur Saint-Jour beckoned me over to the gunwale, where he leaned over, reached down until his head nearly disappeared underwater, and emerged holding a single silt-encrusted oyster, huge and irregularly shaped, in his rough, clawlike fist. With a snubby, rust-covered oyster knife, he popped the thing open and handed it to me, everyone watching now, my little brother shrinking away from this glistening, vaguely sexual-looking object, still dripping and nearly alive. </p> <p>I took it in my hand, tilted the shell back into my mouth as instructed by the by now beaming Monsieur Saint-Jour, and with one bite and a slurp wolfed it down. It tasted of seawater . . . of brine and flesh . . . and, somehow . . . of the future. </p> <p>Everything was different now. Everything. </p> <p>I'd not only survived - I'd enjoyed . </p> <p>This, I knew, was the magic I had until now been only dimly and spitefully aware of. I was hooked. My parents' shudders, my little brother's expression of unrestrained revulsion and amazement only reinforced the sense that I had, somehow, become a man. I had had an adventure , tasted forbidden fruit, and everything that followed in my life - the food, the long and often stupid and self-destructive chase for the next thing , whether it was drugs or sex or some other new sensation - would all stem from this moment. </p> <p>I'd learned something. Viscerally, instinctively, spiritually - even in some small, precursive way, sexually - and there was no turning back. The genie was out of the bottle. My life as a cook, and as a chef, had begun. </p> <p>In 1981, my good friend from high school, Sam G, became the chef de cuisine of Work Progress. A once-trendy restaurant on Spring Street in SoHo, the place had fallen on hard times. It was now under new ownership and Sammy - one of us ! - was in charge of putting the kitchen together. It was what a lot of us had been waiting for, our own thing, and the call went out to all our old cronies. From Provincetown, Cape Cod, where I'd had my first job as a dishwasher, came Dimitri, enticed by excited promises of culinary history in the making. From West Village saloons, we recruited every young, pot-smoking, head-banging hooligan we'd ever worked with, filling their heads with dreams of glory. \"We're forming . . . like . . . a rock-and-roll band, man, an all-star group of culinary superstars . . . kinda like Blind Faith. We're going to tear a new asshole into the New York restaurant scene.\" </p> <p>We fancied ourselves the most know-ledgeable and experienced young Turks in town, and our hearts were filled with hope and the promise of enviable futures. We thought we were the only cooks in New York who could quote from the Larousse Gastronomique and R\u00e9pertoire de la Cuisine, who knew who Vatel, Car me and Escoffier were, what Bocuse, Verg\u00e9 and Gu\u00e9rard were doing across the water, and we were determined to replicate their successes and their fame. There was no one on the horizon we could see who could touch us. </p> <p>The new owners of Work Progress, our putative masters, were a textbook example of People Who Should Never Own A Restaurant. There were two brothers - one half-smart, the other genuinely dumb - who'd gotten a few bucks from Mommy and Daddy, along with their partner, a slightly more cognizant college friend who could actually read a P and L sheet and crunch a few numbers. Their principal business was investing in off-Broadway shows. As this, apparently, wasn't unprofitable enough, they'd chosen the restaurant business as a way to lose their money more quickly and assuredly. </p> <p>From the get-go, Sammy, Dimitri and I managed to intimidate the partners right out of their own restaurant. At every suggestion from this novice triumvirate, we'd snort with contempt, roll our eyes with world-weary derision and shoot down whatever outrage - be it tablecloths, flatware or menu items - they'd come up with. </p> <p>We fought all the time, Sam, Dimitri and I. Waving our cookbooks at each other, we'd squabble endlessly over the \"correct\" way to prepare certain dishes. We teased, poked, prodded, sulked, conspired and competed. We wanted to be the best, we wanted to be different but, at the same time, correct. We came up with the looniest, most ambitious menu our endorphin-overloaded brains could agree on, a sort of Greatest Hits Of Our Checkered Careers So Far collection. French classics sat side-by-side with Portuguese squid stew, my Tante Jeanne's humble salade de tomates, dishes we'd lifted out of cookbooks, stolen from other chefs, remembered seeing on TV. There were Wellfleet oysters on the halfshell, there was a pasta dish from Mario's - a sort of taglierini with trail-mix and anchovies, as I recall - scallops in sorrel sauce (from Bocuse, maybe?), calves' liver with raspberry-vinegar sauce, swordfish with black beans and white rice, pompano en papillotte, my mom's cr\u00e8me renvers\u00e9e . . . </p> <p>We were high all the time, sneaking off to the walk-in at every opportunity to \"conceptualise\". Hardly a decision was made without drugs. We worked long hours and took considerable pride in our efforts - the drugs, we thought, having little effect on the end-product. That was what the life we were in was about, we believed. We might be tripping out on blotter acid, sleepless for three days and halfway through a bottle of Stoli, but we were professionals , goddammit! We didn't let it affect our line work. And we were happy, truly happy, like Henry V's lucky few, a band of brothers, ragged, slightly debauched warriors, who anticipated nothing less than total victory - an Agincourt of the mind and stomach. </p> <p>We were pretty busy initially and, along with the young prot\u00e9g\u00e9s who held us in something like awe, Sam, Dimitri and I would work all day and late into the night. When the restaurant closed, we'd take over the bar, drinking Cristal - which we'd buy at cost - and running fat rails of coke from one end of the bar to the other, then crawling along on all-fours to snort them. The cuter and more degenerate members of the floor staff would hang with us, so there was a lot of humping in the dry-goods area and on the banquettes, 50-pound flour sacks being popular staging areas for after-work copulation. A squadron of punk rocker junkie guitar heroes ate for free at Work Progress - so we got free tickets and backstage passes to the Mudd Club, CBGB, Tier Three, Hurrah, Club 57 and so on. And when the clubs closed it was off to after-hours, where we'd drink and do more drugs until, weather permitting, we'd hit the seven o'clock train to Long Beach. We'd finish the last of our smack on the train, then pass out on the beach. Whichever one of us woke from the nod would roll the others over to avoid an uneven burn. When we finally arrived back at work, sand in our hair, we looked tanned, rested and ready. </p> <p>We considered ourselves a tribe. As such, we had a number of unusual customs and rituals all our own. If you cut yourself in the Work Progress kitchen, tradition called for maximum spillage and dispersion of blood. One squeezed the wound till it ran freely, then hurled great gouts of red spray on the jackets and aprons of comrades. We loved blood in our kitchen. If you dinged yourself badly, it was no disgrace; we'd stencil a little cut-out shape of a chef knife under your station to commemorate the event. After a while, you'd have a little row of these things, like a fighter pilot. The house cat - a mouse-killer - got her own stencil (a tiny mouse shape) sprayed on the wall by her water bowl, signifying confirmed kills. </p> <p>We cared little for managers or owners - or customers, for that matter. </p> <p>Unsurprisingly, our restaurant was rapidly failing. I began to see, for the first time, what I would later recognise as Failing Restaurant Syndrome, an affliction that causes owners to flail about looking for a quick fix, a masterstroke that will \"turn things around\", reverse the already irreversible trend toward insolvency. We tried New Orleans Brunch - complete with Dixieland band. We tried a prix fixe menu, a Sunday night buffet, we advertised and we hired a publicist. Each successive brainstorm was more counterproductive than the one before. </p> <p>When the paychecks started bouncing, and the vendors started to put us on COD (cash on delivery), the owners called in the restaurant consultants. Even then, we knew what that meant: the consultants usually arrive just ahead of the repo men and the marshals. It was the death knell. We had tried. We had failed. Naturally, we held the owners responsible. It was a tough spot, the ambiance was no good, the music in the dining room sucked, the waiters weren't well trained . . . But the truth was, we just weren't good enough. Our food, while charming to some, was unappealing to most. We did not commit seppuku. Sam and Dimitri stayed on, determined to go down with the ship. </p> <p>But my cousin had hooked me up with my very first chef job, at a spanking-new but already troubled bote in the theatre district, and I jumped at the offer. I felt bad about leaving my friends behind. And I had the beginnings of a very nasty little heroin habit from all the dope I'd been sniffing - but hey! I was about to become a chef! </p> <p>It is one of the central ironies of my career that as soon as I got off heroin, things started getting really bad. High on dope, I was at least a chef, well paid, much liked by crew and floor and owners alike. Stabilised on methadone, I became nearly unemployable by polite society: a shiftless, untrustworthy coke-sniffer, sneak thief and corner-cutting hack, toiling in the culinary backwaters. </p> <p>I worked a seedy hotel on upper Madison, a place so slow that the one waiter would have to come downstairs and wake me when customers came in. I worked a lunch counter on Amsterdam, flipping pancakes and doing short-order eggs for politicos and their bagmen. I worked a bizarre combination art gallery/bistro on Columbus, just me and a coke-dealing bartender - a typically convenient and destructive symbiotic arrangement. I was a sous chef at a very fine two-star place on 39th, where I dimly recall preparing a four-course meal for Paul Bocuse; he thanked me in French, I think. I worked a deserted crab house on Second Avenue. I cooked brunches in SoHo, I slopped out steam-table chow at a bar on 8th Street to a bunch of drunks. </p> <p>For a time, I took another chef's job - of sorts - at a moment of need at Billy's, a combo sit-down/take-out upscale chicken joint on Bleecker Street. It was an operation that was to be the flagship of another planned empire, a chain of chicken joints that would stretch across the globe. </p> <p>At this low point in my career, I didn't care if the place succeeded or not. I needed the money. </p> <p>My boss was an older Jewish guy, fresh out of prison, who'd named the place after his youngest son, Billy, a feckless ne'er-do-well. He had been, in an earlier life, the head of the counting room at a Las Vegas casino and, after being caught skimming off millions for the \"boys back in New York and Cincinnati\", had been offered a friendly deal should he co-operate with the prosecutors. He had, admirably, declined, and as a result spent the last five years eating prison chow. When he got out, a near-broken man, his old buddies in New York, being Men of Honour, set him up with this restaurant as a sign of gratitude for services rendered. </p> <p>Unfortunately, while in prison, the old man had completely lost his mind. He may have been a stand-up guy, but he was absolutely barking mad. </p> <p>This was not a classic bust-out operation, where the mob deliberately runs a place into the ground, using a front man/straw owner to run up bills, then pillage the place for merchandise and credit. I think that the wise guys really wanted the poor slob to make money and be a success. They made earnest efforts to help at every turn, enduring much nonsense from their visibly deranged partner. </p> <p>I'd seen mobsters around before, of course, but I'd never worked in a place that was out-and-out mobbed up, where I came to know on a personal basis real wise guys, whose names I recognised from the papers. Everyone was astonishingly up-front about their connections. My boss was fond of yelling into the phone when discussing prices with a purveyor, \"You know who I am? You know who I'm with ?!\" </p> <p>We did things differently at Billy's. </p> <p>My cooks, for one: every one of them came from the Fortune Society, guys who spent their off-hours in halfway houses, allowed out only to work. I was used to working with a fairly rough bunch, a lot of whom, at one time or another, had had problems with the law - but at Billy's every single one of my cooks was still basically a convict. I can't say that it was an unhappy arrangement, either; for once, I knew my cooks were going to show up at work every day - if they didn't, they went back to prison. </p> <p>And credit was easily obtained. I knew, from previous experience, how difficult it is to set up terms for a new restaurant; even getting a week's credit with some of these companies was usually a lengthy process, involving credit applications, a long wait, initial periods of cash on delivery. At Billy's, no sooner was I off the phone than the stuff was arriving, often on 60-day terms. </p> <p>My boss spent a lot of time on the phone, investigating the serious business of horses and their bloodlines, and how well they ran in mud or on grass. Billy himself, at 18, was happy to drive his sports car around and chase girls. So my day-to-day was spent mostly with some genial gentlemen from an Italian Fraternal Organisation. They helpfully told me where to buy my meat and poultry, and how to meet the folks who would be supplying my linen, bread, paper goods and so on. I had a lot of meetings in cars. </p> <p>\"The bread guy is here,\" I'd be told, and a late-model Buick would pull up out front. An old guy in a mashed-down golf cap would beckon me from the driver's seat and then get out of the car. The older guy in the passenger seat would slide over, indicating he wanted me to get in, sit next to him and talk. We'd sit there in the idling car, talking cryptically about bread, before he brought me around to the trunk to examine some product. It was a strange business. </p> <p>My boss got wackier and wackier. When we finally opened, we were packed from the first minute. Orders flooded in over the phone and at the counter and at the tables. We were unprepared and understaffed, so the Italian contingent - including various visiting dignitaries, all with oddly anglicised names (\"This is Mr Dee, Tony, and meet a friend, Mr Brown . . . This is Mr Lang\"), all of them overweight, cigar-chomping, middle-aged guys with bodyguards and 10,000-dollar watches - pitched in to help out. Guys I'd read about later in the papers as running construction in the outer boroughs, purported killers, made men, who lived in concrete piles on Staten Island and Long Beach and security-fenced estates in Jersey, carried brown paper bags of chicken sandwiches up three flights of stairs to Greenwich Village walk-up apartments to make deliveries; they slathered mayo and avocado slices on pitta bread behind the counter, and bussed tables in the dining room. I have to say I liked them for that. </p> <p>But when my boss, inexplicably, showed up one day and told me to fire everyone with a tattoo on my staff, I was faced with a dilemma. Every one of my cooks was festooned with prison tats: screaming skulls, Jesus on hypodermic crosses, bound in barbed wire, gang tats, flaming dice, swastikas, SS flashes, Born to Lose, Born Dead, Love Hate, Mom, portraits of the Madonna, wives, girlfriends, Ozzy Osbourne. I tried to put him off, explaining that we couldn't do without these guys, that the hardest-working, most indispensable guy we had - the guy who right now was loading trash cans with hundreds of marinating chicken parts in the cramped, stifling unrefrigerated cellar on his 22nd consecutive double shift - he was a goddamn Sistine Chapel of skin art. And where am I going to find a convict without a tattoo? The Watergate burglars weren't, to my knowledge, available. </p> <p>Things only got worse. He came in the next day, obsessing about gold chains and jewellery. My grill man had the usual ghetto adornments of the day. \"Where do you think that eggplant [aubergine] got all that gold?\" he raved, spraying food and saliva as he talked. \"Selling drugs. That shit is poison ! Mugging old ladies! I don't want that in my restaurant! Get him out!\" This was clearly impossible, and I sought counsel with one of the silent partners who, as my boss had become increasingly unpredictable, had grown noticeably less silent. \"You hear what he wants me to do?\" I asked. The man just nodded and rolled his eyes, sympathetically, I thought. </p> <p>\"Do nothing,\" he said, and then, with truly dangerous intonation, added, \"Aspetta,\" meaning \"Wait\" in Italian. </p> <p>I didn't like the sound of that. He smiled at me, and I couldn't help picturing my boss, slumped over a dashboard after one of those meetings in a car they were all so fond of. When things came to a head a few days later, my boss openly screaming in the middle of a crowded dining room that he wanted all the tattooed guys and gold chain-wearers \"Out! Now!\" I told him to pay me what he owed - I was leaving for good. He refused. The silent partner came over, peeled off my pay and an extra hundred from a fat roll in his suit pocket, and gave me a warm smile as he bade me goodbye. </p> <p>I don't know what happened to Billy's. It certainly never developed into a worldwide chain as my crazed boss had envisioned - or even a second store. The next time I was in the neighbourhood, a picture framer occupied the space where the restaurant had been. What happened to the old man and his dreams of a poultry empire for his son? I can only guess. </p> <p> After what he calls the \"wilderness years\" and an interlude launching a high-profile Tuscan restaurant, Bourdain happily fetched up two years ago as chef at Les Halles, a successful New York brasserie. He's there still, having also found time to write a couple of novels. </p> <p>There was a lull in service the other night, one of those all-too-brief periods of about 10 minutes when the floor staff is busy trying to turn tables, and even though the bar is packed three deep with waiting customers and there's a line out the door, the kitchen is quiet. </p> <p>I stood in the doorway to the cellar prep kitchen and smoked a cigarette nervously. We were in that eerie, eye-of-the-hurricane calm. When the next wave of hungry public had been seated and breaded and watered, there'd be a punishing rush. First, the salad guy would get hit, then the saut\u00e9 station and finally the grill, until everything came down at once - the whole bunch of us in the cramped kitchen struggling and sweating and cursing to move orders out without falling in the weeds. We had only a few moments of peace to go, and I smoked and fidgeted and half-listened to what my crew was talking about. </p> <p>The tone of the repartee was familiar, as was the subject matter - and I realised that, my God . . . I've been listening to the same conversation for 25 years ! </p> <p>Who's the bigger homo? Who takes it in the ass? Who, exactly, at this particular moment, is a p\u00e9d\u00e9, a maric\u00f3n, a fanocchio, a puta a pato? It's all about dick, you see. </p> <p>This is the real international language of cuisine, I realised, watching my French sous-chef, American ptissier, Mexican grill, salad and fry guys exchange playful insults with the Bengali runner and the Dominican dishwasher. </p> <p>As an art form, cooktalk is, like haiku or kabuki, defined by established rules, with a rigid, traditional framework in which one may operate. All comments must , out of historical necessity, concern involuntary rectal penetration, penis size, physical flaws or annoying mannerisms or defects. </p> <p>The rules can be confusing. Pinche wey means \"fucking guy\", but can also mean \"you adorable scamp\" or \"pal\". But if you use the word \"pal\" - or, worse, \"my friend\" - in my kitchen, it'll make people paranoid. \"My friend\" famously means \"asshole\" in the worst and most sincere sense of that word. And start being too nice to a cook on the line and he might think he's getting canned tomorrow. My vato locos are, like most line cooks, practitioners of that centuries-old oral tradition in which we - all of us - try to find new and amusing ways to talk about dick. </p> <p>Homophobic, you say? Sub-mental? Insensitive to gender preference, and the gorgeous mosaic of an ethnically diverse work force? Gee . . . you might be right. Does a locker-room environment like this make it tougher for women, for instance? Yep. Most women, sadly. But what the system seeks, what it requires, is someone, anyone , who can hold up their station, play the game without getting bent out of shape and taking things personally. </p> <p>But let's say you do \"take it in the twins\", it's no impediment to survival. We're too busy, and too close, and we spend too much time together as an extended, dysfunctional family to care about sex, gender preference, race or national origin. After level of skills, it's how sensitive you are to criticism and perceived insult - and how well you can give it right back - that determines your place in the food chain. I've been flaco and cadavro, probably borracho. That's just the way it is. I call down to my prep kitchen on the intercom - calling for butter or more sauce - and that little gangster who keeps my stock rotated and makes that lovely chiffonaded parsley for me is going to reply (after I'm out of hearing), \" Fuuck YOUU!! \" before giving me exactly what I asked for. Better I say it first: \"Gimme my fucking mantequilla and sauce, motherfucker. Horita . . . and . . . fuuuck YOU!\" And I love that little thug, too - the headband-sporting, baggy-pantsed, top button-buttoned, bottom button open, moon boot-shod, half Puerto Rican, half cholo vato loco, with his crude prison-style tats and his butterfly knife tucked in his wristband. I have, on many occasions, pondered adopting him. He's everything I'd want in a son. </p> <p>It's been 27 years since I walked into the Dreadnaught kitchen in Provincetown with my hair halfway down my back, a bad attitude, and a marginal desire to maybe do a little work in return for money. </p> <p>How much longer am I going to do this? </p> <p>I don't know. I love it, you see. </p> <p>I love heating duck confit, saucisson de canard, confit gizzards, saucisson de Toulouse, poitrine and duck fat with those wonderful tarbais beans, spooning it into an earthenware crock and sprinkling it with breadcrumbs. I love making those little mountains of chive-mashed potatoes, wild mushrooms, ris de veau, a nice, tall micro-green salad as garnish, drizzling a perfectly reduced sauce around the plate with my favourite spoon. I enjoy the look on the face of my boss when I do a pot-au-feu special - the look of sheer delight as he takes the massive bowl of braised hooves, shoulders and tails in, the simple boiled turnips, potatoes and carrots looking just right, just the way it should be. I love that look, the same look I get when I approach a plate of perfect oysters. It's a gaze of wonder: the same look you see on small children's faces when their fathers take them into deep water at the beach, and it's always a beautiful thing. For a moment, or a second, the pinched expressions of the cynical, world-weary, throat-cutting, miserable bastards we've all had to become disappears when we're confronted with a something as simple as a plate of food. When we remember what it was that moved us down this road in the first place.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/weekend/story/0,3605,353201,00.html\">Read the second part of the extract here</a></p> <p>\u00a9 Anthony Bourdain, 2000</p> <p>This is an edited extract from Kitchen Confidential: Adventures In The Culinary Underbelly, by Anthony Bourdain, published by Bloomsbury on August 21, priced \u00a316.99. <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502444710.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p>",
  "<p> Reading the Guardian's media section, I often think about the differences between my media menu in London and back in New Jersey.</p> <p> With newspapers, as with much else broadly cultural, it's a binge/ purge life: soak, wallow, revel in newsprint here for three months in the summer, and accept an ascetic diet for the rest of the year.</p> <p> At home, I read one daily newspaper: the New York Times. Here I read at least three; four on Sundays. In my view, quantity also means quality. The intense competition of London journalism - 12 national newspapers compared to three in the US (the Times, the Wall Street Journal, and USA Today) - leads to innovation, imagination, and daring. Moving back and forth, I notice how much the papers create a national identity. </p> <p> The difference is not just about access. When I first started spending part of the year in London in the 70s, getting the London Sunday papers in the US was a rare, expensive treat. Now, the Guardian is available every day at the kiosk in my little university town, and the Sundays are sold at the supermarkets every Monday.</p> <p> I can keep up with British culture in enough depth and detail to be able to understand the jokes in Private Eye - which I've never seen on sale in the US but get by subscription. This culture seems to be becoming more global every day because of new electronic technologies. All major British newspapers have their own websites now, as do newspapers all over the world. With a growing network of net cafes, any traveller or expatriate here can get news from there: but does there still exist in the age of pixels? </p> <p> \"If one is an expatriate from, say, New Zealand,\" as American political scientist Daniel Bell notes, \"one can click on to a website which offers weekly coverage and gossip of all events back home, if there is any longer such a place as back home.\" Many cultural critics think that national, let alone local, identities are being homogenised by Hollywood, the net, television, global conglomerates, and advertising.</p> <p> When teenagers in Sheffield or Wellington use, like, the same slang as New Jersey mall rats, we might despair of linguistic individuality. When we are bombarded 24/7 by headlines from radio, television, newspapers and websites, and can watch the news on the Heathrow Express trains and get it on mobile phones, we might think that less news would be good news. </p> <p> Undisputedly, newspapers are going through a period of radical change, and traditional forms of journalism and reporting are being transformed by competition with other media. Newspapers need to offer readers much more than coverage in order to survive.</p> <p> For at least a decade, British journalists have developed a first-person style that builds reader identification, affection, or angry dependence.</p> <p> Critics, editorial writers, and columnists like Nancy Banks-Smith, Brian Sewell, Michael Billington, Jay Rayner, India Knight, John Diamond, Jonathan Freedland, Matthew Parris, Julie Burchill, and the amazing Craig Brown (the greatest satirist since Max Beerbohm), offer forceful opinions and literary skills that enhance experience, so that it seems richer and more meaningful to have watched a television programme, eaten a meal, seen a play, heard a speech, taken a trip, or shared a calamity, after having read what they have to say about it. Their stylistic inventiveness contributes to a golden age of British literary creativity.</p> <p> American journalism is different. On the whole, people read a paper and not a journalist. Coffee-break discussions will refer to what was said in the New York Times, not what was written by such excellent reporters and reviewers as Brent Staples, Gina Kolata, Margo Jefferson, Janet Maslin, or Michael Winerip. The exceptions are the critics who wield disproportionate power: the widely-read, but not much-loved butchers and bitches of books and Broadway. Even they write in an impersonal house style, devoid of neologism or play.</p> <p>Moreover, American newspapers ignore each other as features in the cultural landscape. Their feuds, disagreements, and circulation wars are largely kept from readers. British newspaper writing, in contrast, has pioneered a kind of meta-journalism that is now being copied by American internet magazines like Slate. </p> <p> To read a British newspaper is to become drawn into a series of family quarrels, with regular updates; not only, for example, critical scorecards, but also passionate debates on the overall quality of British culture, values, and civilisation. Newspaper editors and journalists are national figures with active roles in the life of the city and the country. These are some of the qualities that make my seasonal total immersion in British media so exhilarating. Even as the internet erases some of the cultural specificity of journalism, newspapers reinvent it.</p> <p> For the next few weeks, while Ian Mayes is on holiday, I'll be exploring some places where Anglo-American cultural difference surfaces in newsprint, around life's markers of birth, marriage, and death.</p>"
