  "<p>In the past few weeks several leading fund managers have announced they are quitting their jobs to set up their own 'investment boutiques'. </p> <p>Henderson is losing three of its technology team at the beginning of next year. Andrew Gibb, manager of the M&amp;G European Smaller Companies fund, and Justin Seager, manager of the Dresdner RCM UK Equity Growth and Brunner Investment Trust, are also leaving to set up their own operations. </p> <p>Unfortunately, they will be moving outside the scope of most retail investors for the time being. Although the term 'investment boutique' sounds like a scaled down version of a traditional in-vestment house, boutiques are in fact involved in running highly specialist hedge funds for extremely wealthy investors - with a minimum of \u00a3100,000 to play with. </p> <p>The moves by all these managers is damaging to those investors holding units in their current funds. Jason Hollands, of London independent financial advisers Best Investment, says: 'The flow of star fund managers to boutiques and hedge funds is one of the biggest trends in the industry and threatens to starve the retail market of much of its talent. </p> <p>'The loss of Andrew Gibb, for example, is a real blow to M&amp;G. In the short time that he managed the M&amp;G European Smaller Companies fund, he has turned it into the clear leader in this specialist sector. If you hold the fund, it's time to get out.' </p> <p>There are several reasons why fund managers are set-ting up their own operations. One is undoubtedly money. While fund managers are well paid, hedge-fund managers typically have a large share in the business, and are paid a performance-related fee. 'Why retire with \u00a32million or \u00a33m in the bank when you can have \u00a350m or \u00a3100m by setting up your own business?' is how one manager puts it. </p> <p>Investment freedom is also very important. Scott McGlashan, who quit Perpetual at the beginning of the year to set up Jade Ab-solute, a boutique specialising in Far Eastern hedging, says: 'Perpetual had grown to such a size that it was no longer the entrepreneurial business it once was. Once investment houses reach a certain size, they become less flexible in how they manage money, and more fixated on benchmarks and weightings. It's less satisfying for a fund manager to work in these conditions.' McGlashan believes hedging will have an important role for anyone wanting to generate returns in unpredictable or bear markets. </p> <p>'We've been living in an environment where inves-tors assumed that markets just went up year after year, and that the buy and hold policy of long-term investment therefore worked. But in the type of markets that we've seen recently, that policy is a disaster. There is the possibility that we're now at the start of a bear market which could last for several years. This means a buy and hold policy is inappropriate.' </p> <p>Hedging is usually seen as a highly risky method of in-vestment. This is partly be-cause hedge funds are usually only reported on when they collapse, resulting in multi-million pound losses, or in conjunction with fi-nancial gurus such as George Soros, who made \u00a31bn out of sterling leaving European Monetary Union through his own hedge fund. </p> <p>But the definition of hedging is to secure against loss, and hedge fund managers claim that many of the funds incorporating hedge strategies are less volatile and risky than normal equity-based funds. </p> <p>Traditional in-vestment is based on a 'buy and hold' strategy, where fund managers buy certain shares in an attempt to outperform the market, but generally their performance reflects the direction of the stock market. In contrast, the aim of hedge funds, often referred to as alternative investment strategy funds, is to produce positive month by month returns, regardless of what happens in the stock market. </p> <p>There are several methods of hedging, involving different levels of risk and reward, but the most common is the long/short strategy. A fund using this strategy might focus on regions such as the US or Europe or on a specific sector such as technology. The manager attempts to beat the market by buying and holding shares that he thinks will go up by more than the market (this is the long part of the strategy). </p> <p>He also tries to make money by selling shares or other financial instruments (futures and options) that he believes will fall further than the rest of the market, and then rebuying them at a lower price (selling short). Rather than buying the shares he is going to sell short, the manager borrows them from a specialist broker, and pays interest to the broker for the loan of the stock. If he thinks the market generally will go up, more of his fund will be invested long, and if he thinks the market will fall, he will invest more of the portfolio on a short basis. </p> <p>For example, a manager might start with \u00a320,000, borrow a further \u00a320,000 and use the whole lot to buy UK shares. At the same time he borrows and then sells \u00a330,000 of FTSE All Share Index futures. This means his net long exposure is \u00a310,000 (\u00a340,000 less \u00a330,000), just half his initial capital. If the value of the shares he has bought rises by 5 per cent while the market remains flat, he will make a return of \u00a32,000 (\u00a340,000 times 5 per cent). </p> <p>However, if the manager gets his bets wrong, the losses can be dramatic, particularly where the fund has borrowed heavily to buy investments. And the investment freedom that has attracted so many managers can prove very dangerous for investors. </p> <p>Bridget Cleverly, of Matrix Money Management, says: 'A fund manager who has a good track record may begin to do things differently and move away from his previously successful approach without consulting anyone. Because of the wide mandates open to AIS fund managers, this is much easier and more common than in the mutual fund industry. This is why constant monitoring is so important.' </p> <p>For this reason, the Financial Services Authority and its predecessors have re-fused to allow hedge funds to be marketed in the UK, and only a very few specialist independent financial advisers and stockbrokers are willing to advise on them. </p> <p>Nearly all hedge funds are domiciled in the Cayman Islands, which does not charge tax on any returns. But although gains are rolled up in the share price, they will be subject to income rather than capital gains tax when brought back into the UK. </p> <p>Although it is too expensive and risky for most people to invest directly into hedge funds, it is possible to spread risk by investing in a fund of hedge funds. The Alternative Investment Strategies fund is a \u00a361m investment trust managed by International Asset Managers, an investment firm that has dealt in hedge funds for the past 20 years. </p> <p>Alan Djanogly, manager of the fund since its launch in December 1996, runs a conservative, diversified portfolio, investing in 15 to 20 large hedge funds. </p> <p>The fund's shares are mostly held by institutional investors such as the Co-op and Chase Flemings, but International Asset Managers is about to start promoting the fund to retail investors, providing a pack that explains hedging and the fund's strategy, and the option to put the fund's shares in an ISA run by a private client broker. Al-though the trust is denominated in dollars, its shares can be bought through normal broking channels at UK dealing prices. </p> <p>Private bank Leopold Jo-seph has also launched a fund of hedge funds for cautious investors, with a minimum subscription of US$50,000. Matrix Money Management is planning to launch another fund of hedge funds next year, concentrating on funds using low-risk, low-volatility strategies, for \u00a310,000 minimum. </p> <p>Djanogly believes that a fund of funds is the only suitable way for ordinary private investors to get involved with hedge funds. </p> <p>'There are about 7,000 hedge funds available at the moment. I see 200 managers a quarter and of those I expect to find four or five who are of real interest. We try to cherrypick, but the average investor won't have the resources or capital to find the best managers.' </p> <p> For more on hedge funds try <a href=\"http://www.hedgeworld.com\">www.hedgeworld.com</a>, <a href=\"http://www.aima.org\">www.aima.org</a> and <a href=\"http://www.eurohedge.co.uk\">www.eurohedge.co.uk</a>.</p>",
  "<p>Forget technology, media and telecoms. In the past six months, TMT has stood for Trauma, Mayhem and Tragedy as the British Techmark index and the Nasdaq, the US equivalent, have fallen by more than 40 per cent. So why has Barclays Global Investors chosen this month to launch yet another product to invest in TMT companies? </p> <p>The answer is twofold. First, the best time to buy is often when no one else wants to. Those who bought shares after the 1987 stock market crash did very nicely; those who followed the herd into the market just before the crash took years just to get their money back. </p> <p>But the main reason BGI has chosen now to launch its iShare, the iFTSE TMT fund, is that the Stock Exchange has only just launched the index it will track. </p> <p>Like a tracker fund, iShares follow a particular index but, while trackers are unit trusts that invest in the components of the index, iShares are shares in their own right. If used correctly, they can be a lot cheaper than unit trusts. There is no upfront fee, while unit trusts can charge anything up to 5 per cent as an initial fee. The annual charge is also low - 0.5 per cent, against up to 2 per cent for a unit trust. </p> <p>But you will have to pay stockbrokers' commission whenever you buy and sell. If you shop around, you should be able to find a broker to deal in small amounts of shares for around \u00a315, but you would obviously not want to buy and sell too often. The best deal is from Comdirect, the Internet broker, which will allow you to deal in iShares as often as you like for a fixed \u00a325 a year. </p> <p>There will also be a differ ence between the price at which you buy and sell the shares, called the spread. But, with the existing iShare, which tracks the FTSE 100, the spread has been less than 5p, less than you would pay in stamp duty on a traditional share. iShares, by a quirk of the legislation, are free of stamp duty. </p> <p>The iFTSE TMT will have a fairly narrow remit. To qualify, companies must be in the FTSE 350 index, involved in the TMT sectors and trade on the Stock Exchange's automated dealing system, Sets. Currently, 36 companies qualify, including Vodafone, BT and Sage. </p> <p>Some of the companies are so large - Vodafone, for example, would represent more than 36 per cent of the fund - that the Stock Ex-change has introduced a weighting system. Thus, the top 10 components by value will be limited to 4 per cent of the new index. The next 10, 3.5 per cent and so on. </p> <p>That will still mean a high level of exposure to just a few companies, with only 20 accounting for 75 per cent of the fund. John Demaine, managing director of BGI, says investors should expect it to be highly volatile. </p> <p>Technology shares may have fallen sharply but many observers feel there could be further to go. Those who are still keen on the market should consider iShares as a good way in - but it may be worth waiting a few weeks.</p>",
  "<p>Football, the late Liverpool manager Bill Shankly famously said, was not a matter of life and death: it was much more serious than that. Don't laugh: the dismal state of English football holds up a merciless mirror to the condition of British management as a whole. </p> <p>Consider the paradox of the English Premiership. It is the richest league in the world, containing in Manchester United the most valuable club and a global sporting brand. Its players are millionaires. Yet its strengths are as superficial as an internet retailer's profits. While the Premiership clubs are top of the league at making money by any means available, they can't between them produce a national team to beat Finland. </p> <p>Compared with their foreign counterparts English players are embarrassingly underskilled, underprepared and undereducated. And it's not just the players who are lacking. English managers too, as Kevin Keegan had the honesty to admit, are one-sidedly short of the technical and professional skills needed at top level. No club with a realistic chance of winning the Premiership has an Englishman in charge. No wonder Keegan thinks he is not the man for the job: Ars\u00e8ne Wenger has a PhD in economics, for goodness sake. </p> <p>As in football, so in other industries. UK firms pride themselves on their profits, their deal-making ability and the zillions they pay their top earners. Yet the economy as a whole is as flexible and attractive to support as, well, an England football side on a wet Wembley afternoon. </p> <p>Prices are among the highest in western Europe - even allowing for the exchange rate; a symptom of inefficiency or exploitation, if not both. Productivity remain obstinately 30 per cent below that of the US, and 25 per cent below that of France and Germany. The public sector is a morass of low morale and poor standards. With a few exceptions, such as pharmaceuticals, the UK industries that work are foreign-owned (the flip side of burgeoning inward investment) and/or foreign-managed: cars, electronics, the City, even retail. </p> <p>Bluntly, UK management is second rate. Blame it partly on dreaded British 'pragmatism', not so much a philosophy as an excuse for not having any guiding system of thought at all. That makes managers as steadfast as a weathervane, a prey to fads and fashions and perversely overreliant on market mechanisms to guide them. </p> <p>Pragmatism is in turn the product of outdated education and abysmal training, which leaves an unskilled workforce dependent on a management class that is as handicapped in doing its job as Kevin Keegan was. </p> <p>With its lack of a systems view, British management has been notoriously poor at handling the large-scale demands of the old economy - witness its inability, unlike France, Germany and Italy, to maintain a domestic motor or engineering industry, its shambolic transport system (terrifyingly underlined last week) and its fraying health service. </p> <p>But nor, alarmingly, is it much better at the people-based new industries: the UK lags behind Germany as an internet centre, and its technology start-ups have failed to become large, economy-driving engines of growth. </p> <p>Lacking both the brutal, individual, entrepreneurial drive of the US, which it wishfully aspires to, and continental patience, which it de-spises, UK management is marooned between the two, with the weaknesses of both and the strengths of neither. If Rover is the epitaph on the UK's performance as an industrial economy, the Dome is hardly an encouraging prologue to the new. </p> <p>Together, pragmatism and technical weakness have powerful consequences. British management (and finance) avoid complex processes and industries, preferring to grow opportunistically by acquisition rather than organically, to outsource and simplify rather than tackle the hard tasks of planning and investing for the future. People management, despite the lip service, is not among its strengths or even its main concerns. </p> <p>In football, as in industry, this manifests itself in a systematic adoption of the easiest rather than the right solution. Football clubs pay over the top for foreign stars rather than investing in the long term to grow their own. Likewise British companies prefer to poach staff rather than train them, buy technology rather than invest in R&amp;D, and abandon markets they find it difficult to compete in, until there's nowhere else to go. The archetypal UK company of the past 30 years was Hanson, a master of the raid, the break-up and the management of decline, until it ran out of road and had to carve itself up. </p> <p>But as Hanson, Rover and English football all prove, the market is a treacherous mistress. 'Easy' solutions are usually a snare and a delusion, and much-trumpeted apparent strengths, such as short-term profits, inward investment and the English language, all too often turn out to be long-term weaknesses. Competitive advantage is all about developing new competencies through doing difficult things, not easy ones - satisfying the most demanding customers, finding ways to compensate for an appreciating currency, or just building the world's best mousetrap. </p> <p>The pay-off should be inventive and exhilarating, as in the beautiful game. </p> <p>For now, UK companies, like football clubs, are buying time by importing foreign managers - Luc Vandevelde for M&amp;S, Robert Kiley for London Underground, and any number of peripatetic Americans in the City. Nothing wrong with that - as long as they take a leaf from Kevin Keegan's book first. He had the critical awareness to understand his shortcoming.

  "<p>It is difficult to move at the moment without hearing the sound of crashing dot.com companies. It started in the spring, when free-spending sports retailer, Boo.com, bit the dust, and has been gathering pace ever since. The fall in European shares has been happening against the descant of a worldwide slump in technology stocks that has seen high-flyers like <a href=\"http://www.priceline.com\">Priceline</a> (the US pioneer of customers bidding online for airline tickets) fall by 42% in a single day. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.yahoo.co.uk\">Yahoo</a>, one of the strongest net stocks, suffered a 27% fall in its share price last week. Even mighty Microsoft has seen its market capitalisation more than halve this year (before recovering this week). The latest casualty is Boxman.com, thought to be one of the most viable e-retailers, which sells CDs on the net from a central warehouse. This week it announced it was facing liquidation. </p> <p>A year ago it was so different. Venture capitalists - hitherto a rare sighting in Britain's capital markets - appeared from nowhere and were falling over themselves to lend money to almost any young person with a business plan in their knapsack and the word \"internet\" in the executive summary. The word \"dot.com\" - American, of course - soon became a sassy suffix for coolness in business.. </p> <p>The explosion of web start-ups in the UK was heralded as the start of a New Economy, albeit blown in by a transatlantic wind. In this new world, the internet would lower prices by cutting out the middle person while enabling budding entrepreneurs to start up global businesses from their back bedrooms. Any company that didn't embrace the world wide web for selling (and purchasing), would be smothered by those that did. </p> <p>So what went wrong? Nearly all the early claims of the internet were, and still are, true. Yes, it is an all-embracing change that will transform the way we do business, the way we are educated, and the way we are entertained. What the preppy-preneurs forgot, however, was the importance of two rules of the old economy and one of the new. </p> <p>First, they failed to appreciate that in the old economy 50% of all new small companies fail within the first four years. Whether you call it the creative destruction of capitalism or just natural selection, it is inescapable. Given that the brash new internet companies were run by people who were young and often inexperienced, and who were operating in an unexplored area, the failure rate for dot.coms was always going to be higher than the historic average for small companies. </p> <p>What was different was the extraordinary media attention these upstarts attracted. Small businesses which normally die unmourned and alone are now being cremated under a national spotlight. Take Clickmango, the start-up that attracted a lot of publicity because it had Joanna Lumley as its figurehead. When it crashed it emerged that its monthly turnover was only \u00a34,000. My local corner shop does better than that, but you won't see it in the national press. </p> <p>Second, they underestimated two old economy mantras: marketing and delivery. It is easy to build an attractive website that anyone in the world can access at the click of a mouse, but expensive to tell people it is there and to get them to buy, let alone deliver quickly when they do buy. Small wonder that virtually no dot.coms in the UK selling to the consumer are making money. And that includes <a href=\"http://www.lastminute.com\" target=\"_new\">Lastminute.com</a>. It has been beating its budgets but its last quarterly accounts revealed it spent almost \u00a36m on marketing, nearly six times the value of its entire sales. Yesterday the head of <a href=\"http://www.altavista.com\" target=\"_new\">Altavista</a>, the US search engine portal, resigned. Earlier in the year the division had reported losses of $307m on revenues of $98m in the second quarter. Say no more. </p> <p>Third, and most culpably, the dot.coms failed to understand the nature of the beast they had embraced: on the internet the consumer, not the producer, is king. The centrifugal forces of the world wide web push power away from the centre and outwards to the millions of global users who, at the click of a mouse, can find the same product cheaper elsewhere. The dot.economy turned out to be just a more expensive way of selling old economy goods at knockdown prices. </p> <p> Was it all just a year of madness, a momentary dot.con? Not at all. We are merely entering the second stage of a long voyage with some of the flotsam discarded. Traditional companies are waking up to the fact that old economy strengths like brands and reliable delivery are vital in the new era. They are already starting to gobble up the failing dot.coms to boost their own net initiatives. </p> <p>It is no coincidence that the biggest successes of the new economy - like the universal portal, Yahoo, and the electronic auction house, eBay, are companies that couldn't exist without the internet. The next stage of the revolution will not only see traditional industries embracing the net. There will also be an explosion of activities that exist only within the internet - like digital music, films, two-way video and the huge potential of the new \"peer-to-peer technology\". This enables computers around the world to exchange files (whether music or films or data) with each other without going through intermediaries. </p> <p>This is brilliant for the consumer but bad for business. There is a real possibility that items like pop songs or books will become commodities like \"breaking news\" which are given away for nothing because it is impossible to make money from them as long as they are freely exchangeable on the net. Unsurprisingly, companies are seeking refuge by trying to build monopolies (whether of \"content\" or infrastructure) to escape the deflationary forces of the internet. </p> <p>Even the current rush to build giant \"business-to-business\" electronic market places, where spare parts and components can be bought at the cheapest price, can be seen in the same light - a defensive move by producers to offset the web-induced downward pressure on retail prices. </p> <p>This is the reality behind the absurd overvaluation of internet share prices. Some of the valuations made the South Sea Bubble seem like a village jumble sale. Now they are falling rapidly to earth, but with some way to go. Be happy you are a consumer: there will be lots of bargains among the debris. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:vic.keegan@theguardian.com\"> vic.keegan@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The quokka is like a rat the size of a cat. But they don't scuttle like rats. And they've none of the imperious cunning of a cat. They stumble around just wanting to be loved, a very cute and dim marsupial which lives virtually nowhere in the world except on Rottnest Island, off the coast of Perth. </p> <p>They do all right, there's about 10,000 of them, and they adore tourists - emerging from the undergrowth to wave down buses and pose for their photocalls. </p> <p>Admittedly, the end of the school year is a fraught time, when the footie-loving boys from Perth and Fremantle arrive on \"Rotto\" with their crates of Swan to celebrate freedom. But the authorities reckon they've cracked down on the worst excesses of the vicious \"quokka soccer\" phenomenon. </p> <p>Rottnest has a checkered past, it's true, being a former Aboriginal penal settlement and a prisoner-of-war camp, but it is a truly beautiful, fascinating island, 11km by 5km, and a great day trip. </p> <p>The best way to travel is by bicycle. Cycle to a secluded bay, white sands, Indian Ocean water like Evian, sunbathe for a while. Cycle some more. Make friends with the quokkas. Enjoy the unique environment - where else will you find Rottnest Island pine trees? Indulge in the snorkelling. If you want to watch the humpback whales continue on their migration, you have until December. If birds are your thing, osprey patrol the southern coast while cormorants are frequent visitors. And then back to the Rottnest Island tea rooms for food - try the stir fried beef and fried rice. </p> <p>We arrived at Rottnest on the ferry from Fremantle - a return trip with Boat Torque Cruises <a href=\"http://www.boattorque.com.au\">www.boattorque.com</a> costs from \u00a350. They also take a glass-bottomed boat out from the island. </p> <p>There is no better way to get to Fremantle than to cruise down the Swan River, a vast, relaxing waterway where you'll be unlucky if the dolphins don't decide to help you along. (Try <a href=\"http://www.captaincookcruises.com.au\">www.captaincookcruises.com.au</a> - return trip \u00a310.50 including wine tasting.) </p> <p>Perth itself is a stunning city. After two hours, I wanted to emigrate. It is one of the most isolated cities in the world and, as a result, all life is relaxed, harmonious. </p> <p>Locals will tell you that not only is Perth the sunniest state capital in Australia but it also has the best beaches. Cottesloe Beach in particular is idyllic, and lunch at the Indiana restaurant a real joy. Indeed any foodie will be knocked out by Perth. The place is teeming with fine restaurants. </p> <p>If you want to push the boat out, one of the best is Fraser's in the vast Kings Park with amazing views of the entire city. The special on the evening I was there was panfried barramundi with asparagus and spinach. </p> <p>At night, Perth becomes a warm version of Manchester, vibrant, exciting with endless places to eat and drink. A good plan would be to head to Northbridge, north of the city centre, to eat Chinese, Thai, Singapore or just a bowl of pasta. Then go drinking in the fashionable Subiaco district. </p> <p>Around 80% of Western Australia's 1.8m population live in Perth - yet the state takes up a third of Australia. Out of town is awesome, empty country. </p> <p>Flying is by far the best way to get around. We flew from Perth to Paraburdoo and made a base for two nights in the small archetypal mining town of Tom Price. </p> <p>This place is as rough and ready as it gets. It's more or less owned by Hamersly Iron and was built in 1962. Train engines pull endless carriages of iron ore - about 22,000 tonnes - from Tom Price to the coast. </p> <p>The town's only pub - known locally as the animal bar - could almost be a Newcastle working men's club. There's pool tables (best to stick to the locals' rules), a makeshift betting area, the archaic unused discotheque equipment sitting sadly in the corner, a jukebox with an amazing collection of John Cougar. But the men holding up the bar are good company, partly through amazement that a tourist would want to go there but also from genuine friendliness. </p> <p>A drive out of Tom Price and you're in the Karijini national park, stunningly rugged terrain in the heart of the Pilbara region, one of the oldest land formations on earth. The Aboriginal people have lived here for 30,000 years, arriving by sea, it is thought, from the islands of what is now Indonesia. </p> <p>The park's tourist centre, interesting though it is, is still very much a large tent, but by next year a new $3m centre should be open. But you don't come here for man-made things, you come for the gorges, the stunning views, the walk through nature. </p> <p>Our guide for the day was Tim Baird of Design-a-Tour (<a href=\"http://www.dat.com.au\">www.dat.com.au</a>) who lead us down red gorge paths, past shimmering white gum trees, paper trees, fig trees even, into subterranean aquamarine pools and waterways where you can swim, hang out and marvel at the beauty without another soul in sight. </p> <p>Karijini is not full of tourists - only 35,000-40,000 come here each year, and most Western Australians are ignorant of the intense, breathtaking beauty of the place. </p> <p>From Tom Price, we drove west through land rich in wildlife: kangaroos, emus and bungarras - a very fast 4ft long lizard which would not be out of place on the Walking with Dinosaurs set. If you want real outback, this is it. </p> <p>Isolated sheep stations are increasingly opening their doors to tourists. We stayed at Giralia, 100km south of Exmouth. The place is massive, about 265,000 hectares with up to 25,000 sheep. Dinner, bed and breakast costs between $50 and $90 a night. If you can't get in touch with your inner self here, then consider a clinic. </p> <p>The vastness takes your breath away. It's a ferociously empty, beautiful land where the pioneers are still alive and working. </p> <p>Another long drive and we're on the coast. Forget the clogged commercial beauty of the Great Barrier Reef on the east coast, the Ningaloo is, at 260km, the longest fringing reef in the world, protecting a lagoon teeming with the most incredible marine life. People here are rightly proud of the marine beauty and diversity - and anxious for it not to go the way of the reef on the other side of Australia. </p> <p>The beaches could be from Bounty adverts - white sand, achingly gorgeous blue-green water, and, of course, the all-year sun. Along the reef, take your pick, there's so much room here. Turquoise beach is popular with snorkellers and Osprey Bay is a fine place to just fall asleep. </p> <p>We were based in Exmouth, a reinvented former naval base offering high-standard accommodation from as little as \u00a320 a night. A backpacker can stay for about \u00a36 a night. </p> <p>Neil McLeod, an archetypal outback man if ever there was one, operates a one-day safari for about \u00a395 in his OKA - an ungainly Australian-built vehicle which seems to use tank engineering to create the coach that will go anywhere. </p> <p>You will see a lot of kangaroos as you drive through western Australia, most of them, lamentably, dead by the road. But McLeod takes you to places you're not allowed, where there are large communities of kangaroos airily passing the time until spooked by something. They then get in a right fluster and hop crazily all over the place. You can, unfortunately, see why so many end up by the side of the road. </p> <p>The highlight of the McLeod safari is Yardie Creek, 90km from Exmouth, which runs in from the ocean over a sand bank through intimidating vertical red rock. This is one of the few domains of the threatened black-footed rock wallaby which manages to survive in tight crevices and on impossibly small ledges. Seventy years ago, these timid, fascinating, marsupials were abundant across Australia but proved easy prey, mostly killed off by foxes. No one's going to get them here. </p> <p><strong> The practicals</strong><br> </p> <p> Mark Brown travelled with Travelbag (0870 7377779 <a href=\"http://www.travelbag .co.uk\">www.travelbag .co.uk</a>) which organise tailormade holidays and flights to Australia.

  "<p><strong>Asia</strong></p> <p>From the package holiday honeypots of <strong> Pattaya</strong>, with its many bars, and <strong> Phuket</strong> to as yet less commercialised <strong> Koh</strong> <strong> Samui</strong> off the east coast and the smaller islands such as <strong> Krabi</strong> and <strong> Phi Phi</strong> with their excellent snorkeling, Thailand offers a huge range of options for the winter escapee. Combine beach with some sightseeing, shopping and wonderful eating in <strong> Bangkok</strong>. Bring back orchids to brighten the ensuing winter days. </p> <p>Malaysia's <strong> Penang</strong> combines plenty of good hotels and beaches with the stilt houses of <strong> Georgetown</strong>, the island of <strong> Langkawi</strong> is for those wanting sand, palm trees and total relaxation, as is the deliciously-secluded and up-market <strong> Pangkor Laut</strong>, where you may sleep in rooms constructed on piles over the sea. The country's east coast remains relatively undeveloped. </p> <p>Away from the main holiday beaches, <strong> Bali</strong> retains its culture of festivals and dancing. There are temples by the thousand and a stunning landscape whose terraced rice fields are dominated by volcanic mountains and irrigated by deeply channeled rivers that flow from their slopes. </p> <p> <strong> Best months to go: </strong><br>Thailand's lowest rainfall is from December to February and average top temperatures well above 30C. Malaysia is similarly warm but can be a little wetter. Winter is not the best time for Bali. Rainfall is highest in December and January, and humidity, although commuted by sea breezes, is high. That said, sunshine is also prolonged and average maximum temperatures are around 30C. </p> <p><strong>Australia</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Sydney</strong> basking in Olympic congratulation, is the obvious jumping-off point - all glinting water and splendid, eclectic eating. Climb the superstructure of the Harbour Bridge, linger in the botanical gardens, visit the excellent Art Gallery of New South Wales. Shoe-horn in enough time for the beaches, of which there are plenty. (Locals say Whale Beach, to the north, is best.) </p> <p>Take to the water in boat-mad <strong> Perth</strong>, barbie by the Yarra in <strong> Melbourne</strong>. <strong> Adelaide</strong> has more outside restaurants than you can count. <strong> Tasmania</strong> would be a good option, with its ravishing beaches and great hiking trails, such as that recently opened on the Bay of Fires. Avoid the period around Christmas, when air fares soar. </p> <p> <strong> Best month to go: </strong><br> Not much to choose between December and January, when temperatures in Sydney are between the high teens and mid 20s and humidity moderate - but rainfall tends to increase after that. Between December and March, it rains stair-rods in Queensland and the Northern Territory. Hottest days in Perth are around three degrees warmer than in Sydney. Rainfall is lowest in December but negligible from November to March and humidity is slight. Tasmania is cooler, with top temperatures hovering around the 20C mark between November and March, although it is usually drier than Sydney. </p> <p><strong>Bahamas</strong> </p> <p> Strangely under-patronised by the British. <strong> Nassau</strong> has fine beaches, slick hotels and gambling, but the out islands are delightful, with little or no development, sparse population, a tempo so slow as to be near imperceptible and stretches of deserted sand. Including the smaller cays, there are a total of 700, among them the <strong> Abacos</strong>, <strong> Exumas</strong> and <strong> San Salvador</strong>, where Columbus made his first landfall. </p> <p> <strong> Best month to go: </strong><br> December. </p> <p><strong>Bermuda</strong></p> <p> Although less than 600 miles from New York, the main island and its neighbours remain warm even in mid-winter. Sublime beaches, great snorkeling and scuba diving. Echoes of empire -cricket is played, and judges wear white wigs. </p> <p>The capital, <strong> Hamilton</strong>, has buildings of pastel-coloured elegance; indeed, Mark Twain once wrote that he'd rather stay in Bermuda than go to heaven. </p> <p> <strong> Best month to go: </strong><br> the weather is probably best after mid-December but then remains pretty consistent until spring, with average maximum temperatures around 20C. </p> <p> <strong>Canaries</strong></p> <p> Unquestionably Britain's most popular winter sunshine destination, but if you are looking for somewhere completely different, forget it - on Tenerife's <strong>Playa de las Americas</strong>, full English breakfast is readily available, and Old Speckled Hen and Warsteiner lager are on tap. And there would have been no problem finding a TV on which to watch England's latest, woeful World Cup performance. </p> <p>However, there are escape routes: the interior of <strong> Tenerife</strong>, dominated by Mount Teide, is spectacularly beautiful. It offers excellent hiking, as does the Macizo, or massif, on the north-west of the island where you can follow Inca-like trails cut by the Guanche people, who are believed to have migrated here from North Africa some 2,000 years ago. Gran Canaria also has wonderful, lush scenery away from its main resort areas. And there are less brash resorts, such as Tenerife's Puerto de la Cruz, and Puerto del Carmen and Playa Blanca on the volcanic island of <strong> Lanzarote</strong>. </p> <p>The nightlife on <strong> Fuerteventura</strong> is fairly low key, too. Unlike Lanzarote, it has white-sand beaches. While rain is not uncommon in winter, temperatures are pleasant. Those determined to swim in the sea should remember that this is the coast of the Atlantic. However conditions for windsurfing can be excellent. </p> <p> <strong> Best months to go: </strong> February and March. Average maximum temperatures are in the low 20s and total rainfall is about 25mm. </p> <p><strong>Caribbean</strong> </p> <p> Choose your island carefully because they vary greatly. <strong> Jamaica </strong> is probably the most fun and arguably the most beautiful. When you are bored by the beaches, do the tourist thing and slither up Dunn's River Falls, take a raft trip down the Rio Grande, look for crocodiles up the Black River and on no account miss No\u00ebl Coward's former home, Firefly. </p> <p><strong> Cuba</strong>, a combination of beach, history, politics and culture, runs Jamaica close. <strong> St Lucia</strong> and <strong> Grenada</strong> are also scenically lovely, <strong> Antigua</strong> less so but with an abundance of beaches. In <strong> Barbados</strong>, the sea shifts softly from azure to emerald green along west coast coral beaches of fine white sand while Atlantic surf thunders on its eastern shores. </p> <p>The US and British Virgin Islands are also sharply different. <strong> St Thomas</strong> in the USVI is a major port of call for cruise ships and does a roaring trade in duty free, the BVI's <strong> Tortola</strong> and <strong> Virgin Gorda</strong>, some of whose beaches are accessible only by boat, are much sleepier. </p> <p> <strong> Best month to go: </strong><br> like their characters, island climates vary - although not so sharply. February and March tend to be the driest with average rainfall between around 25mm and 40mm, humidity at its kindest and average maximum temperatures either in the high 20s or around the 30C mark. </p> <p><strong>Florida</strong> </p> <p> Take a canoe down the Wekiva River, only a few miles from downtown <strong> Orlando</strong> and less than an hour's drive from <strong> Walt Disney World</strong>, and you'll feel about as close to the theme parks as an astronaut in orbit. Turtles slide into the water from tree roots, blue heron stalk fish - but read Carl Hiaasen's acid eco-novel, Sick Puppy, for a reminder of how fragile it all is. Even if Disney and <strong> Universal Studios</strong> are not for you, <strong> the Kennedy Space Centre</strong> at Cape Canaveral is worth a look, if only to see just how cumbersome computer equipment was when mankind took that giant step. Your kids now have more sophisticated gear. </p> <p>Beaches, on the Gulf and Atlantic coasts, are too numerous to mention. <strong> Miami</strong>'s were once thought of as the Costa Geriatrica but South Beach is now high art-deco chic. Go to the <strong> Everglades</strong>, drive down the Keys to Ernest Hemingway's wonderfully atmospheric house at <strong> Key West</strong>, eat Cuban and Cajun and great seafood - from crab cakes to grouper. <strong> Sanibel Island</strong>, on the Gulf of Mexico, is a wonderful retreat. </p> <p><strong> Best month to go:</strong><br> December is probably favourite, with minimum temperatures in the high teens (centigrade), maximum in the mid 20s, an average of around 50mm or rain and manageable humidity. </p> <p><strong>The Gambia</strong> </p> <p> Budget packages, a shortish flight and no time difference have made it an introduction to Africa for generations of holidaymakers. Surrounded on three sides by Senegal, it runs like a wedge inland along its eponymous river and is, give or take a few metres, entirely flat. Fine, long, shell strewn beaches, mangrove creeks, rich bird life. Crocodiles, birds and a large variety of monkeys at Abuko Nature Reserve. Be sure to take precautions against malaria. </p> <p><strong> Best months to go:</strong><br> December - March. Low rainfall. Average maximum temperatures around 30C but more likely in the mid to high 20s during the day. </p> <p><strong>Goa</strong> </p> <p> There has been much argument about the impact of tourism on culture and the environment and the extent to which its economic benefits are trickling down to all levels of society. That said, the former Portuguese colony has avoided the curse of the high-rise hotel and has superb beaches along its 65 miles or so of India's Arabian Sea coastline. </p> <p> <strong> Best months to go: </strong><br> December - March. Low rainfall, humidity bearable in comparison with summer. Average maximum temperatures around the 30C mark. </p> <p><strong>The Gulf</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Dubai</strong> has recently opened a clutch of swish new hotels, among them the spectacular Jumeirah Beach. Fine swimming, watersports, bargain shopping and desert diversions. </p> <p> <strong> Best month to go: </strong><br> January is usually the driest month in Eilat, with maximum average temperatures creeping above 20C. If anything, marginally warmer in the Egyptian resorts. January and February are ideal in Dubai, with highest average temperatures in the low to mid 20s and rain unlikely. </p> <p><strong>Kenya</strong> </p> <p> Combine an Indian Ocean beach holiday with a safari in the <strong> Tsavo National Park</strong>, on the border with Tanzania. The main beaches, of white coral sand and protected by reefs from the open sea, are to the south of the old trading port of Mombasa. Snorkeling and scuba diving can be excellent. To the north are more beaches at Watamu and at Malindi, where the reef is a marine National Park. </p> <p><strong> Best months to go</strong><br> January and February have the lowest rainfall, with average temperatures around 30C. </p> <p><strong>Madeira</strong> </p> <p> With its steeply terraced fields, vineyards and fishing villages, it is altogether quieter and more sedate than the likes of Tenerife. That is largely because of the island's rugged coastline and limited beaches. </p> <p>Maderia is best recommended to those in search of a little gentle exploration and to walkers who can follow the network of irrigation channels, known as levadas. </p> <p> <strong> Best month to go: </strong><br> Visitors in January tend to suffer the least winter rainfall, and maximum average temperatures are around 20C. </p> <p><strong>Mauritius</strong> </p> <p> Many argue its magnificent white-sand beaches, some sheltered, some with surf, are better than those of the Caribbean. Mainly for those seeking unadulterated R&amp;R, although the capital, Port Louis, is worth a quick visit. </p> <p> <strong> Best months to go: </strong><br> tropical storms are likely in winter, but average maximum temperatures range from the high 20s to around 30C. </p> <p><strong>Mexico</strong> </p> <p> For a pure beach holiday, go for <strong> Puerto Vallarta</strong> on the Pacific Coast. <strong> Canc\u00fan</strong> has its drawbacks: it is little more than a strip of beachfront hotels in all manner of architectural styles. It may be better to stay on the nearby island of <strong> Cozumel</strong>, which has good snorkeling. But both are a springboard for the ancient Mayan sites of <strong> Tulum</strong> and the stupendous <strong> Chichen Itza</strong> with its 1,200-year-old pyramid of El Castillo. </p> <p> <strong> Best months to go: </strong><br> in Cancun, rainfall is lowest December - March and average temperatures are in the very high 20s or around 30C. On the Pacific coast there is negligible rain, and average temperatures range from a minimum of about 23C to a maximum of roughly 32C. </p> <p><strong>Middle East</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Eilat</strong>, Israel's Red Sea port, is functional rather than idyllic, but new five-star hotels have opened and there is less building work than there once was. It offers great coral reef snorkeling and scuba diving. Side excursions are possible to Petra, in Jordan, and to the Timna National Park. </p> <p>Superb diving to be found on the Egyptian Red Sea coasts, too - at <strong> Sharm El Sheikh</strong>, a good jumping-off point for St Catherine's Monastery, and at the east coast resort of <strong> Hurghada</strong>. </p> <p><strong>South Africa</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Cape Town</strong> is the best bet. Be prepared for intense beauty soured by a slew of shanty towns. For sweepingcoastal views the energetic may decide to make an assault on Table Mountain; the sedentary can ride the cable car. The jazz scene remains vibrant. The Cape, which has produced musicians such as Abdullah Ibrahim, has a sound of its own. See fur seals at Hout Bay, eland and baboon in the Cape Nature Reserve. </p> <p><strong> Stellenbosch</strong> and the surrounding vineyard country has elegant Cape Dutch architecture and estates where you can lunch and taste wines. </p> <p> <strong> Best month to go: </strong><br> February. Average minimum daily temperature in the mid teens, maximum mid 20s, 16C, rainfall under 8mm. </p> <p><strong>South America</strong> </p> <p> Air fares remain at historic lows. It is possible, this winter, to fly to <strong> Rio de Janeiro</strong> for \u00a3329 or to the Chilean capital, <strong> Santiago</strong>, for \u00a3415. All human life is there on Rio's beaches. </p> <p> <strong> Best month to go: </strong><br> December for Rio. Average daily temperature is around 20C minimum - 26C maximum, rainfall around 100mm - but that's less than in January, February or March. Fairly sticky. </p>",
  "<p>Every morning the only signs of life on the beach are the footprints of birds and the new crab trails that criss-cross the sand like miniature motorbike tyre tracks. From your bed to the sea, it's 20 paces across soft white sand into the pale turquoise of the Indian Ocean, warm as a baby's bath and so clear you can see every ripple of the sandbars underfoot. Overhead, the sky is the deepest blue with occasional puffs of small white clouds. It will stay like that all day every day if you have steered clear of the monsoon months of May and June. </p> <p>The Maldives are more than 1,000 small coral islands, 600kms south west of Sri Lanka stretching in clusters across the equator over a distance 750km long and 118km wide. Only 202 of them are inhabited by the Maldives 250,000 citizens. Seventy-four others have been turned into resort islands devoted to pretending that Robinson Crusoe had an easy life. To promote this illusion, virtually all supplies, including the building materials and equipment must be flown in from Europe, the Gulf, Thailand and India. </p> <p>The Maldivians, devout muslims since the 12th century, have kept a strict distance from their visitors. Tourists are only allowed on inhabited islands for brief visits. They glimpse a world unchanged for centuries where the mosque rules and women wear long skirts and a veils. There are no cars, no television, no hotels or restaurants. The tourists are soon returned to their fantasy worlds. </p> <p>The tourist industry, which with fishing is the backbone of the country's economy, is a masterpiece of logistics that daily disperses large numbers of tourists by speedboat, sea plane or helicopter to islands where a few years ago there was precisely nothing except mangroves, banyans and coconut trees ringed by coral reefs. But as you flyover the islands today, the hotels are mainly invisible, never reaching above tree level, although some have rooms built on stilts out over the water. </p> <p>What you see from the plane is an extraordinary tapestry of blues: dark like a tuareg's robe, but sprinkled with green/blue patches shading to the palest turquoise where the coral reef is near the surface, often in a circle surrounding an island. </p> <p>Reversing the image, you can imagine the Maldives as a vast volcanic mountain range 5,000m high and submerged beneath the Indian Ocean except for the coral peaks visible today. The range stretches from the Lakshadweep Islands near India to the Chagos Islands south of the Equator (soon, courtesy of the British courts, to be repopulated by its original inhabitants removed by Britain 30 years ago to allow an American air base to be built at Diego Garcia). </p> <p>The Maldives are in the Guinness Book of Records as the world's flattest country, and no island is more than 2.4m above sea level. Three years ago, when El Ni\u00f1o raised the sea temperature around the Maldives by two degrees, to 30C, and much of the coral reefs died, the word was, \"go to the Maldives quick if you want to see it before global warming swamps the islands\". </p> <p>But now, according to the islanders, the panic is over. The water temperature has dropped, and in the past six months the reef in some places has tripled in size. </p> <p>Kunfunadhoo, on which our hotel, Soneva Fushi, is situated, is in the far north of the Maldives, half an hour by sea plane from the capital and main airport at Male. When the plane bumps down on the ocean, it is hard to imagine a more remote scene - the sea touches the horizon on every side. From the island, a boat chugs out to meet the plane. </p> <p>The handful of people arriving with you on the seaplane will be led away down sandy, heavily-shaded paths into the woods, mostly never to be seen again. Soneva Fushi is the ultimate in hotels, offering complete privacy, no chintz sofas, and no visible guests. Each family has a small house hidden in huge trees and right by the beach. There are Chinese bicycles outside your house, and you can bike by the light of a dim dynamo and the moon through the trees to the restaurant. </p> <p>Even in the restaurant in the evening, you have only a blurry glimpse of other guests because the lighting is by candlelight and the tables are wide apart under trees leading to the sea. The waiters appear out of the darkness in long white skirts and tops. </p> <p>But if the restaurant is too public, you can always have a barbecue of lobster and tuna brought on to the beach in front of your house. </p> <p>At night on the beach and in the forest, the smell of the mangrove's white star flowers is intoxicating, somewhere between the gardenia hedges of the American south and English jasmine bushes. When you come back from dinner, a white mosquito net is round the bed and the sheet and pillow have been covered with scarlet and pink bougainvillaea and white frangipani flowers. </p> <p>This is not a world pene trated by CNN, but instead the perfect atmosphere for watching the old movies provided with your video. There is Pride and Prejudice with Laurence Olivier, Citizen Kane, Some Like it Hot, and enough Peter Sellers to last you through a monsoon. </p> <p>Your house boasts a bathroom partly open to the sky so you can shower looking at the stars, and it is designed with plantation teak from Indonesia in Scandinavian style which encourages you to linger. Or you can lie on the huge pale linen sofa in the veranda, watching the tide lap over the sand in the moonlight. </p> <p>You could read a book a day lying on that sofa, or on the big wooden day-beds under the coconut palm in the garden, or the hammock slung from two coconut trees over the water. But you might also find yourself losing the plot because of the distraction of the constant murmur of the sea and the rustle of the trees. There's also the clicking of the geckos and the cawing of the giant crows to listen to, and the insistent call from the mosque twice a day. </p> <p>Overhead, processions of fairy terns, a speciality of the Indian Ocean, swoop down with their long white tails which seem almost too heavy for them to lift. Then there are the flying foxes, whose little brown furry faces and enormous black wings can be seen day and night. Be warned: they like to dive down for a closer look at what's in the hammock at any moment of the day. </p> <p>For 12 hours a day, the light is so clear and brilliant that every detail imprints itself on your retina; every line stands out on the pale grey driftwood on the beach, or on the giant elephant-ear leaves in the forest, or the shadows of the palm fronds across the sand. At midday in the forest arrows of sunlight burn through the trees, but pools of semi-darkness still predominate. </p> <p>From the magic of the rustling dark forest there could not be a greater contrast with the silence and brilliance of life under water for the snorkler. On the reef itself, or in the deep ocean where the reef falls suddenly away, you see colours as vivid and otherworldly as the names: black, white and yellow stripes of moorish idols, turquoise and green of parrot fish, scarlet squirrel fish, eels as long as you are, trumpet fish, butterfly fish, stingrays and manta rays. </p> <p>If you are lucky, you can swim with fat turtles or dolphins, which often come to the edge of the reef. Turtles are endangered, and the Maldives have strict rules about not buying tortoishell jewellery or ornaments. </p> <p>One of the island's oddities is the tame rabbit population. A pregnant rabbit once arrived with a guest, and many rabbit generations later they are everywhere, the lack of predators allowing them to multiply unhindered. They are naturally curious, too, sitting up on their hind legs by the dinner table, or lolloping along by your bicycle. </p> <p>A third of the island's guests are Asian, mainly Japanese and Australian, and part of the secret of the virtually empty beaches is that for many of them the lure of the Maldives is its deep-sea fishing and diving. They disappear on boats for long expeditions, leaving the island seemingly empty of people all day. Others disappear into the spa where Swedish and Thai massage, and every kind of beauty treatment await the sybarites. </p> <p>Behind the trees off the forest paths are huge mechanical workshops that keep the island self-sufficient in desalinated water. Much of the water is used on a vegetable garden which provides fresh salads, but earth had to be shipped in from India to make it viable. A carpentry workshop nearby makes chests, chairs, and towel-rails in bamboo and local woods. Old telegraph poles and railway sleepers have been brought from Australia, Britain, and Indonesia to make some of the heavier furniture such as the bar tables. </p> <p>Robinson Crusoe did not have 250 staff from 16 nationalities working behind the scenes for his comfort and pleasure. What he did have every day, if he wasn't too busy with the business on surviving, was the delight of dusk. Darkness falls in minutes with the abruptness of the tropics, stripping the blues from the water, turning the white sand grey, making the forest even more seductive and mysterious. These are the moments for the hammock and for dreaming you will never leave.</p>",
  "<p>Back in London the next Wednesday, Nicky's topic is Spiritual Warfare: How Can I Resist The Devil? He says that the Devil's tricks include planting doubts - I wonder if he is referring to those people, such as Alice and myself, who doubted the power of tongues. Then I think, maybe the Devil really is planting doubts in my mind. My article is becoming increasingly anti-Nicky. Is Satan working within me? I conclude that I have been on this story for a long time and perhaps need a few weeks off. Nicky turns up the heat. He says we must not take an unhealthy interest in horror movies, ouija boards, palmists, healers, and so on. These are the Devil's tools. </p> <p>Later, in the small group, a woman called Suzanne asks a question. She didn't speak in tongues in Kidderminster but she did burst into tears. \"I went to a clairvoyant a few weeks ago,\" says Suzanne. \"That surely can't be a sin.\" </p> <p>\"I'm afraid it is,\" says Nicky. </p> <p>\"Really?\" </p> <p>\"I would actually ask God for forgiveness for that,\" says Nicky. </p> <p>\"Oh, come on,\" snorts Suzanne. \"Where does the Bible say that?\" </p> <p>\"Deuteronomy,\" says Nicky. </p> <p>\"Oh,\" says Suzanne. </p> <p>\"Poor Suzanne,\" whispers Alice to me, \"being made to feel guilty about going to some silly clairvoyant.\" The atmosphere has changed. \"Things are coming to the boil,\" says Alice. \"Can't you feel the screws being tightened?\" </p> <p>\"How are you feeling?\" I ask her. </p> <p>\"Judged,\" she says. </p> <p>Annie is no longer freaked out about speaking in tongues. She feels instead that she experienced God's love in Kidderminster. \"It was the most beautiful experience of my life,\" she says. At first, she hated it, but now she realises that her perception was wrong and that the tongue-speakers are the lucky ones. Annie can now speak in tongues. </p> <p>Nicky asks Tony to tell the group what happened to him in Kidderminster, but he quietly replies, \"No comment.\"</p> <p> Then Alice confronts Nicky. She tells him she felt trapped in Kidderminster. \"It was group pressure. I am very, very upset. I know that you're looking at me like I'm a failure.\" Nicky smiles: \"Nothing could be further from the truth. We simply want to create a non-threatening, non-judgmental environment.\" </p> <p> \"Judged is what I feel,\" says Alice.</p> <p> \"Then we have failed,\" says Nicky.</p> <p> Later that night, Nicky holds me back for a moment. I think he's concerned about how I responded to the tongues. After my Joel mini-testimony, I presume he hoped that I, too, would speak in them. \"Some journalists miss the story,\" says Nicky. \"Lots of journalists miss the story. But you haven't. You've got the story. I knew it from the beginning.\" </p> <p> \"What is the story?\" I ask Nicky. </p> <p> \"That something amazing is happening,\" he says. \"Something incredible. All over the world. In 116 countries.\"</p> <p> \"I thought it was 112 countries,\" I say. </p> <p>\"That was a month ago,\" says Nicky. \"Now it's 116 countries.\" We laugh. \"I would feel absolutely awful about Alice,\" he says, \"but I feel completely free from responsibility.\" </p> <p> \"Do you?\" I ask. \"I'm not hypnotising anybody,\" he says. \"I don't know anything about hypnosis.\" It is getting late. Tomorrow is the start of the Alpha international conference. There will be much good news to report. Alpha is up 156% in New Zealand; one-third of all churches there now run the course. My personal experience with Alpha finishes here. I miss the last few weeks because I have to travel to America. In my group, of those who lasted the course, about 70% were won over.</p> <p> Alice leaves some messages on my answerphone. She says I have missed some incredible things. I call her and ask what happened. \"It was just amazing,\" she says. \"Nicky did a session on healing.\"</p> <p> \"Healing?\"</p> <p> \"Healing by prayer. He started saying, 'I sense someone here has a lump on their left breast that they're very concerned about.' There were maybe 25 of these, and he got it right every time. People were standing up and everyone prayed for them. And then I asked them to pray for my horse, who's ill, and the horse got better. And I had a terrible pain in my left side and I didn't mention it, but Nicky said he sensed it and everyone prayed for me and now the pain is gone.\"</p> <p> \"Wow,\" I say. </p> <p> \"Nicky was gutted that you missed it,\" says Alice. </p> <p> \"You sound like you've changed your mind again,\" I say. </p> <p> \"Oh, I don't know,\" says Alice. \"All I can say is that my horse got better and the pain has gone from my left side.\" She pauses. \"For all my problems with Kidderminster, I've got to say that Nicky is quite brilliant. He's wonderful.\" And I have to admit that, for all my problems with Kidderminster, too, I can only agree with her.</p> <p>\u0095 Some names in this piece have been changed to protect the identities of those concerned.</p>",

But in my thirty-year collection of Press cuttings on a diverse range of subjects, those marked 'England and the English' from British newspapers are twenty times as numerous as any other category.\" </p> <p>Shah died in 1996; but for that, his cuttings file on Englishness would be bursting his shelves. From pop records to political polemics, from television series to reports by charities and dirty flags of St George fluttering from truck cabs, the supposedly unspoken subject of English identity has been raised ever more loudly since. Sometimes, it comes disguised as an assertion or discussion of Britishness: the brief swagger of Cool Britannia, the Runnymede Trust's recent warnings about racial prejudice concealed within the word \"British\". But you can be sure that England, where the great majority of the people and power in these islands - for good or ill - have long resided, is a looming presence. Debates about British multiculturalism tend to mention Bradford more than Bridgend. Blur's big-selling \"Britpop\" songs were about London, not Lothian. </p> <p>Yet ask someone English what their nationality means, and often as not they will still pause and look blank, or mumble something about green fields and cricket. This traditional, rural, pre-immigration definition of Englishness still dominates: for all the current questioning talk about English identity, it is the version all others must compete with. John Major may have been mocked for his sepia speech-making about warm beer and bicycling maids, but people remember what he said. </p> <p>And just as England likes to deny it is interested in itself, so its old-fashioned self-image denies how the English actually live. Most of us reside, or at least work, in big towns and cities. We move along busy grey streets. We hear foreign accents at bus stops. We have never worked in a field. This restless, claustrophobic, relatively cosmopolitan existence has been the lot of the English majority since the industrial revolution two centuries ago, and of Londoners for centuries longer. Visitors from abroad realize it; from Friedrich Engels to French language students wandering open-mouthed in Soho, England has been a place of noise, crowds and a haphazard kind of modernity - not the misty outline of distant hills. </p> <p>Roger Scruton is fleetingly prepared to admit this. \"Foreign visitors in Elizabethan times,\" he writes, \"came away with the impression of a fiery, devious and intemperate people.\" But this is not the sort of discovery his book prefers to make. Instead Scruton, who is a huntsman and Tory philosopher, and runs an austere \"experimental farm\" in the hard, dry soil of northern Wiltshire, has written a defence, of some elegance and sophistication, of the crustiest version of Englishness imaginable. </p> <p>Its cover photograph perfectly establishes his tone. A couple in blurred focus and smart Edwardian clothes stand stiffly on a beach beneath white cliffs. She wears a hat against the milky English sun, there is a wet dog at their feet and a small child playing in the near distance. To Scruton this world, which lasted from late Victorian times until the early 1960s, was the high point of English achievement, a time when his countrymen were \"famous for their stoicism, their decorum, their honesty, their gentleness and their sexual puritanism\". Nowadays, he continues, characteristically cool but regretful, \"those qualities are no longer honoured\". He refers to his country throughout in the past tense. </p> <p>Such sentiments are always around in England - especially during Labour governments. The whiff of conservative partisanship, and the tendency of nostalgics to ignore the violence and instability of much of England's past, often makes their writing easy to dismiss. Scruton, though, is a different prospect. His frame of reference, for a start, includes authors who do not share his politics, such as Linda Colley, the historian of how Britain was constructed, and Tom Nairn, the Scottish prophet of its current dismantling. And Scruton writes with vivid reverence about the culture he sees disappearing, of \"trees wrestling upwards for the light\" in neglected hedges and country churches where \"a peculiar silence had been stored\". He can even be droll: \"Sexual intercourse, Larkin tells us, began in 1963,\" Scruton starts one of the passages of personal memoir here with which he most persuasively makes his argument. \"Certainly it had not begun in 1959 - not in Marlow at least.\" </p> <p>Before his southern English idyll in Marlow, it is a surprise to learn, Scruton grew up in a grimy part of Manchester. His father was a teacher \"occupying the lowest rung\". The family name, rumour had it, came from the illicit seduction of an ancestor who was a servant at Scruton Hall in Yorkshire. Yet the Manchester Scrutons were all thrift and neighbourliness. This enabled the future philosopher to ascend to grammar school and Oxford, in a manner he now considers typical of England at the time. Mentors of infinite patience and knowledge, all male, appear in these pages, instruct the author in manners and high culture, and modestly depart to their bachelor lodgings. </p> <p>This story has some of the moral momentum and intensity of a Victorian novel. Around his grainy memories, Scruton arranges essays about the educational, legal, and geographical structures that bred his favourite sort of Englishness in others. These sections are less successful. Over-familiar assertions of national uniqueness, loosely argued - the unreformed House of Lords, for example, is justified as representing the English countryside, as if it doesn't already have MPs - replace the usual Scruton logic and economy of expression. A brief, unattractive rage rises up in him against unpatriotic intellectuals and illegitimate children who \"litter the country\", undermining the sense of tolerance here, a quality he identifies as a prime English virtue. And the absence of urban England, let alone immigrant England, or the England of pre-eminent innovation in popular culture, begins to remove authority from the pages. When Scruton mourns \"the old improving risks\" his countrymen used to take, you know he has probably never seen a pirate radio station on an east London rooftop. </p> <p>Dennis Hardy understands better that Englishness has always existed in multiple, quarrelling versions. Since at least medieval times, he writes at the start of his careful scholar's volume, \"two oppositional themes have dogged the English character ... the ideal of a benign monarchy and that of a peasant republic.\" His focus is on people of the second inclination, what you might call the anti-Scruton tendency, and their efforts to establish an alternative England during the first half of the 20th century. </p> <p>Interestingly, very few of these socialists, communists and \"hairy-headed banana munchers\", as one cartoon summarized them, put their faith in urban England (although that would change after 1945). The countryside was their laboratory, in particular the Cotswolds and the deep-green southwest, where countless commuting stockbrokers, and Scruton himself, would later live out their own rural dreams. </p> <p>One of these tiny tribes of radicals, microscopically revealed by Hardy, was the Kindred of the Kibbo Kift, set up by a 22-year-old pacifist called John Hargrave in August 1920. They went on camps, wore hooded smocks and fancied themselves, at first, a dissenters' version of the Boy Scouts, then later \"the only English national movement\". They advocated state control and redistribution of money; although membership was only in the hundreds, they were keenly watched by Special Branch. </p> <p>Hargrave felt that England had \"lost itself in a meaningless and devastating commercial scramble\". Scruton, by the end of his book, comes to pretty much the same conclusion. His talk of \"spivs\" ruining the City and \"agribusiness\" razing the countryside, of Labour and even the Tories complicit in the conquests of the global market, sounds like a man beginning to slip his political moorings. Perhaps a certain sort of English person, of whatever ideology, eventually ends up on the barricades against international capital.</p>",
  "<p>The unhappy history of graduate recruitment which has led to mismatches between candidates and firms is producing several changes in the way organisations are bringing people on board. </p> <p>And at this time of year, anyone who is going through the recruitment minefield is likely to find some new developments which promise a better outcome for everyone concerned. </p> <p>The internet has already made it easier for people to find out more about companies they are interested in - a study by occupational psychologist Pearn Kandola discovered that 100% of graduates checked out company websites - and online applications are now the most popular way to make the first step on the route to a job. </p> <p>But some firms this year are going further in their use of the internet as part of the recruitment process. </p> <p>SHL, formerly Savill and Holdsworth, an occupational psychology group which specialises in recruitment is devising questionnaires as part of the selection process so that applicants also get feedback from the websites. </p> <p>\"And even more enlightened companies are putting ability tests on the net instead of waiting to administer these at the assessment centre stage,\" explains SHL's head of communication, Roy Davis. </p> <p>\"This means that it is much quicker for the applicant. They go through a process which might have taken three to four months in a matter of weeks. They know where they are much earlier in the process.\" </p> <p>Websites also tell applicants much about organisations so they sift themselves at the start, says Davis. </p> <p>There are, of course, applicants who might blag an ability test by getting a friend to take it, but Davis says the follow-up at an assessment centre will soon find the fakers out. </p> <p>And, if recruits can't hack it once they are in a job and have to leave after three months they leave a black mark on their own CV. \"But we find most people are honest,\" says Davis. And, anyway, the assessment centre is where candidates are tested more closely and rigorously. </p> <p>Davis believes that in the future assessment centres will change emphasis as more and more companies and organisations use the internet for aptitude tests. \"The assessment centre is likely to concentrate more on personality. So candidates can expect personality tests, group exercises and presentations,\" he says. \"All the evidence shows that assessment centres are the best way to get recruits of the right calibre.\" </p> <p>Getting the right people is crucial when it costs \u00a310,000 per head to recruit a graduate followed by further costs of anything up to \u00a370,000 in training and development before recruits start to contribute to the bottom line. </p> <p>A further development aimed at producing recruitment which is satisfactory to both sides is the \"work sample\" test. This gives candidates a facsimile of a day in the job. Oxford-based occupational psychologists Pearn Kandola has been pioneering these tests. </p> <p>\"Work sample tests are best because they are customised to the organisation and candidates get a flavour of what it is like to work for that organisation,\" explains partner Binna Kandola. </p> <p>He is not keen on the idea of putting aptitude tests on the internet because he believes these tests are done most effectively in person with a test administrator. But then Kandola is not a great fan of aptitude tests in general. \"They are standardised, and used off-the-shelf,\" he says. </p> <p>Recruiting for British American Tobacco, Pearn Kandola created a fictitious scenario for a work sample test that reflected the company's commercial activities. This was to be used internationally. </p> <p>A fictitious country was created, with a fictitious company called Global T that had a new tealeaf with special properties to sell. Global T was designed to share the characteristics of BAT so that candidates experienced a real feel for the company's work. </p> <p>Assessment centre candidates played the role of a management team at Global T with the challenge of developing the product from research stage, through development and production to marketing. \"The candidates really enjoyed it,\" says Kandola. </p> <p>Customising assessment centres helps candidates to understand what companies actually want. An assessment centre devised by Pearn Kandola for Merrill Lynch replicated the noise and hubbub of a trading floor. Candidates were asked to trade using IT screens for information on prices and dealing with phone requests. They traded against each other in what Kandola describes as a \"realistic job preview\". </p> <p>\"It was quite pressured and required communications skills, co-operation and teamwork,\" says Kandola. \"Work sample tests are something to look forward to and to learn from. We are pushing this because research has shown us that the most effective way to recruit is through the work sample. Ability tests only take you so far.\" </p> <p>But, in the end, the candidates' own favourite part of the whole recruitment process is the interview. </p> <p>\"Graduates still want face-to-face contact and the interview is always the most popular part of the selection process because they can talk about themselves and actually meet people who work for the company,\" Kandola explains.</p>",
  "Imagine - it is a cold, sunny day but the train into work will be cramped and stuffy. How much should you put on? What if the weather turns nasty all of a sudden: a heavy shower when it was such a promising start? Will it mean sitting all morning in the office with the uncomfortable feeling of your skirt or trousers drying against your skin? <p>Urban workers, who spend their lives partly in conditions of artificial heating and air-conditioning, partly subject to the whim of the weather, will pass through several environments in one day. Each time, they will want different things from their clothing - that's before they they even consider the gym at lunchtime or what to wear for a social date after work. In the city context, the traditional rules of spring, summer, autumn and winter are becoming less important. In their place is a fifth season of the controlled urban environment, where the old climate rules no longer apply. </p> <p>Let no one say that fashion is all fluff and nonsense, never responding to the consumer's needs. On the evidence of a new exhibition organised jointly by the London College of Fashion and the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, designers - from Issey Miyake and Hussein Chalayan to relative unknowns - are increasingly focusing on the problems of dressing in the urban environment. The Supermodern Wardrobe, as the show is called, is more than a rundown of utility style; it looks ahead to what we might be wearing in the future. People move around more, need more from their clothing. Fashion needs not only to fulfil its traditional role of making us look good and incidentally protecting us from the elements, but also kitting us out for the environment created by the city. \"Supermodern is a term borrowed from the French sociologist Marc Aug\u00e9, who used it to describe the late capitalist condition,\" says the curator Andrew Bolton. \"It's all about excessive information, urban spaces now being within a few hours of one another. A prime example is the internet. You've got so much to think about in your daily lives - these clothes are about simplifying choices.\" </p> <p>So, multipurpose garments are no longer an eccentric's fantasy - or Heath Robinson for fashion victims - but an inspiring and possibly profitable new direction for designers. The versatility of this clothing increases options for the wearer's appearance, but reduces the number of clothes needed. Issey Miyake devoted a substantial part of its autumn/winter 2000 collection to this theme, including Transformer jackets with bolt-on anoraks that can be worn over them, and Film Lining jackets that reverse to a waterproof option. Meanwhile, state-of-the-art fabrics have made their way out of the camping shop and into the collections of hip, small labels such as Vexed Generation; and accessorised clothing has moved on from the days of workwear trousers with a handy strap for your chisel, to jackets containing micro-computers - smart in every sense. </p> <p>Recently, there was the launch of Levi's ICD+, a collaboration between the clothing manufacturer, electronics giant Philips, and designer Maaimo Osti. \"We needed to examine what people need from workwear today,\" said Levi's Peter Ingwersen. \"We identified a group we call nomads, who are constantly on the move, always in taxis or airports and need to be wired.\" The results are jackets with voice-recognition mobile phones and MP3 players, a microphone in the collar and earphones built into the hood; the jackets are machine washable, but the electronics click out before you put them in the machine. </p> <p>Typical features of so-called \"intelligent\" clothing (or I-wear as it is dubbed in the industry) include hoods and pollution masks; colours tend to be blacks, greys and duns - camouflage for the alienating city street - and fabrics decidedly functional, often driven by military research. Vexed Generation has been exploring such themes since it began in 1994. Tucked away in a covered Soho alley, an open door leads you, unannounced, anonymous, up a spiral staircase to the first-floor showroom where a crowd of faceless mannequins display the company's most recent work. </p> <p>\"When we started, we were on the dole and wanted to make London street wear,\" says Adam Thorpe, one half of Vexed Generation. \"We ride scooters and push bikes, we're interested in going out ... There was increasing surveillance, so we had hoods that hid your identity.\" So they came up with their Parka, a menacing \"parody of riot gear\" into whose hood the wearer's face would almost disappear. It was at the time that the Criminal Justice Act was being introduced, so the Parka highlighted issues of civil liberties and CCTV. Made from ballistic nylon originally developed for the Ministry of Defence, it is one of their signature pieces, a variation of which they continue to make. </p> <p>Today, Thorpe and his partner Joe Hunter are \"still on two-wheels but don't want to be in full battledress all the time\". Their latest collection includes more tailored clothing such as the A4 Crombie, smart enough to wear to the office, but with a hood concealed in the collar. \"It is not as in-your-face or confrontational as they used to be, but perhaps the times are not as in-your-face and confrontational. Whereas before you were definitely scaring old ladies in the street, now you have the option to scare old ladies in the street.\" </p> <p>It is Vexed's use of hi-tech fabrics that really sets their clothes apart - at a glance some of the designs might not look that different from utility offerings on the high street. But talk to Thorpe and Hunter, and it is like having a chemistry lesson. They know as much about molecules and endothermic reactions as they do about pleats, lines and tucks. In their new collection, there are semi-tailored \"suit/bike\" jackets made of Corwool, a waterproof fabric that has the warm qualities and appearance of wool: not a hint of bulk, not a whisper of anorak; perfect for wearing in the office; excellent, with its concealed zip pockets to hold your files, for that scooter ride into work. </p> <p> Or you could take that overheated train on a cold day. The real magic of this jacket is the \"phase change\" technology used in the lining, a textile originally developed for Nasa. This will keep you cool in the heat, and warm in the cold. \"Previously, all heat retention was done by trapping air, so you'd have all this bulky, fleecy stuff,\" says Thorpe. Here, the jacket acts as a kind of heat exchanger, taking away excess body heat, giving it back when it is needed. \"The fabric is made of molecules that optimise body temperature - heat is stored in the fabric. Most people are not interested in how the thing works, but what we're trying to do is make a garment that is pared down, modern, utilitarian without looking utilitarian. Can it keep you warm without you looking like the Michelin man?\" </p> <p>While this technology came from Nasa, Maharishi - a label that had a shaky start designing hemp clothing but now has a following that includes Madonna and Brad Pitt - has actually helped develop a new textile. The idea, explains founder and designer Hardy Blechman, was to make hemp, a traditional clothing fabric that is more environmentally friendly than cotton, work in modern times. Due to its associations with marijuana production, hemp had slowly been replaced by cotton in the early part of the 20th century. But the latter, says Blechman, \"is very weak and needs lots of pesticides to grow properly. These environmental issues weren't considered when it was thought that people might get high as a result of growing it. It used to be quite common in English gardens that people would grow their own hemp plants and weave their own things. Underwear for winter, perhaps - a bit itchy, but okay.\" </p> <p>Thanks to a collaboration with the Italian mill ITS Aitea, Maharishi has launched the showerproof Aventail jacket, a hemp and nylon-mix garment that gives a performance element to the natural fibre. And, as well as taking the hippy out of hemp, the Aventail quenches thirst as well. \"At the back of the jacket is a pocket, and in there is a malleable water container,\" says Blechman. \"A tube goes through a series of fabric clips and pops out in front of the face, just inside the collar.\" Here, a bite valve releases the water when you need it. It's a garment for busy urban people on the move - or, for that matter, those who want to go on a long country walk. </p> <p>Mobility translates as multi-function in work by Patrick Cox, Mandarina Duck and CP Company. Cox's 1999 collection, Pieces, uses zips, pop studs and reversible fabrics to create clothing with at least a dual function. A long-sleeved jacket becomes a sleeveless vest, a pair of shorts converts into trousers; all of it folds into its own zip-up pouch. Similarly, Mandarina Duck has the \"jackpack\", a jacket that changes into a rucksack, and CP Company's Transformables include a sleeping bag that converts into a Parka and a long, hooded cloak that becomes a tent. All the pieces are made from a light rubberised nylon mesh that is wind- and rainproof. </p> <p>Some of the designs are strictly novelty value - CP Company's \"Solo\" black waistcoat, with its giant, strap-on torch, for example. It's one thing to be a nightwatchman on a building site, but would you like to dress like one for a fashion statement? \"Some are quite gimmicky,\" says Bolton. \"Philips and Levi's new technology: it's as though they designed the garments first then thought, 'Where can we stick this?' But they're just beginning.\" </p> <p>Levi's claims that there has been great interest in its four ICD+ jackets - which cost between \u00a3500-\u00a3600 - since they began selling this month in outlets such as Selfridges. But what of the long-term prospects for I-wear? Will it make the mainstream? The prices do not seem that outrageous. With ICD+ you get a mobile phone and MP3 player thrown in with a heavy-duty jacket. At Issey Miyake, the Transformer and Film Lining jackets start at \u00a3675 and \u00a3530 respectively, compared with a standard, no-frills Miyake number that sells for around \u00a3500. And at Vexed Generation, despite the hi-tech, niche profile, the A4 Crombie and doublebreasted suit/bike jacket are quite reasonably priced at \u00a3370 and \u00a3290 respectively, and many of its clothes can be found at Harvey Nichols. \"I don't see why it's not going to happen,\" says Joe Hunter, adding that there will always be room for more frivolous clothing. \"It would really be quite dull if everyone dressed the same. There's space for everyone in fashion.\" </p> <p>In the Supermodern Wardrobe show itself, not everything has a utility feel about it. The couture is here, too. Hussein Chalayan is showing his 1999 plastic dress with headrest and armrests inspired by aeroplane interiors. This elegant creation is more intellectual response to the modern world than something you would wear to the shops; but it neatly ties in with Marc Aug\u00e9's ideas of airports being typical of the information overload that are part of the supermodern condition. The same goes for the work of Simon Thorogood, with the panels on his demi-couture womenswear inspired by those on the Stealth bomber. \"It wasn't just that I was looking at aircraft - although I adore aeroplanes - but I saw them as turning over a new leaf in design terms,\" says Thorogood. \"You're dealing with frocks at the end of the day; fashion always will. But you're toying with the exciting idea that it can be more than just frocks. In the same way that music can be more than a melody or a hummable tune.\" </p> <p>\u0095 The Supermodern Wardrobe is at the Fashion Space Gallery, London College of Fashion, 20 John Princes Street, London W1, from November 2-29 .

  "<p>I guess we've all had days like it. Paranoia takes hold and you fear you're Jim Carrey in the Truman Show - trapped unsuspectingly in a 24/7 soap opera for the entertainment of TV viewers worldwide. Well, I have those days and this week my paranoia was tweaked a notch higher by a sneak preview of a forthcoming book about the City. </p> <p>The Death of Gentlemanly Capitalism is a socio-economic study of the corporate fabric of the stock market over the past two decades. It traces the demise of the great British brokers and merchant banks of yesteryear and the emergence of the foreign-owned investment banking colossi that now call the shots in Throgmorton Street. It's a sudsy tale of collusion and cock-up and, says the author Philip Augar, should bring a tear to the reader's eye. </p> <p>Augar is a man with an awe-inspiring curriculum vitae as the head of global equities at, in turn, NatWest Securities and Schroder Securities. He's been there, done it and, in the process, earned the soubriquet Dr. Death from his ever-so-slightly-fearful staff. He's also passed Go a couple of times and has chosen the new career path of scriptwriter rather than soap star. </p> <p>Augar's Death is meticulously researched, leaving no stone on the rocky road from Big Bang unturned. At the same time he steers skilfully \"between academic analysis and populist commentary while avoiding the trap of failing to satisfy either academic or popular audience. Most of his readers, however, will be brokers and financiers searching avidly for enlightenment about shenanigans in their organisations and the odd fruity reference to themselves or workmates. </p> <p>It's a sorry tale familiar to anyone who has worked in the stock market in recent years. The \"great\" British names such as Rowe &amp; Pitman, Greenwell, James Capel and de Zoete &amp; Bevan have either disappeared or become codicils employed by megabanks keen for marketing purposes to retain quaint, faint resonances of the past. Goodbye, J. Henry Schroder Wagg! Hello, Schroder Salomon Smith Barney! </p> <p><strong> Professional contempt</strong><br> </p> <p> Augar lays the blame for the transfer of ownership of the City into foreign hands squarely at the feet of management. Restrained no doubt by the lawyers at Penguin Books, he stops short of outright charges of incompetence, but his professional contempt for those at the helm of many leading City firms through the upheaval of Big Bang lies just below the surface of his text. Try this for size: \"I believe that the speed and totality of the submission of the City's leading firms is one of the most abject surrenders in business history.\" </p> <p>It is less clear just why management should have been so poor, although Augar suspects class might have something to do with it. His text is laced with references to the cloth from which suits were cut, and the schools from which City managers were drawn. Tellingly, he puts the failure of his employer, NatWest Markets, to buy SG Warburg down to a clash of class between NatWest Markets' chief executive Martin Owen and Warburg's bluebloods. </p> <p>\"Owen is not a merchant banker; he has a regional accent, he mixes in different circles and he did not attend Oxbridge or a major public school. The Warburg people were classic gentleman capitalists and would not have been able to stomach reporting to him\". Ironically, Owen has long since disappeared from City life, brought down by a derivatives debacle that revealed flaws in his management structure, while many of the Warburg types are thriving under Swiss ownership. This episode highlights a weakness in Augar's position. As soap star turned scriptwriter, his views of people must necessarily be coloured by his experience working alongside them. Similarly, his view of the changing City cannot fail to be shaped by the firms he worked for at the time. I joined NatWest Markets after Augar had departed. My memories of many leading players in his tale are different. I also experienced the opening of the fault lines in the organisation that led to its fire-sale to Americans and which stemmed in part from the legacy of mismanagement in earlier years. NatWest loved the pursuit of trophies first and profits second - one of the diseases that did for the gentleman capitalists. </p> <p>Showboating is a classic trait of British brokers and financiers. We love to top league tables. We love press publicity. And, we love to demand the recompense from our masters that (we believe) should chime with the headlines. By contrast, American financiers worship their revenue dollars above all else. This shameless pursuit of the bottom line often jars with us Brits, but it's been a recipe for success. </p> <p><strong> Bear facts</strong><br> </p> <p> It's not clear whether the transfer of ownership overseas is a bad thing or not. Augar believes time - in the form of the next bear market - will tell that it is. He laments the loss of the Square Mile's heart and soul and believes \"the City is a branch office of New York with no control over its own destiny.\" </p> <p>It is doubtful, given the collective character flaws identified in this book, whether subjugation could have been avoided. Augar believes it could. He cites Eddie George, the Bank of England governor defending decisions not to rescue Barings or to avert the sale of Warburgs on the grounds that it is location not ownership that mattered. Augar would have had the Old Lady step in. </p> <p>Having witnessed Barings management for a couple of years pre-Nick Leeson I'm not sure they and their bank deserved a safety net. If the City postures to live by the sword, and to enjoy the rewards this brings, then it must die by it too. The Death of Gentlemanly Capitalism indeed.

  "Weeping and demanding revenge, Israeli settlers in the West Bank yesterday pledged to fight Palestinians alone if the army would not defend them - adding a new and volatile element to the worsening crisis over the collapsing peace process. <p>Thousands of mourners, many armed, streamed to the settlement of Kedumim near Nablus to bury Rabbi Binyamin Herling, aged 60, killed in a clash with Palestinian gunmen on Thursday. </p> <p>Rabbi Haim Druckman, a veteran activist, gave a tearful eulogy and called on Israel's leaders to halt peace negotiations. \"What else needs to happen before they open their eyes?\" he asked. </p> <p>Questions were still being asked about why a 36-strong group of civilians, including several children, had been allowed to go on what they billed as a hike so close to the West Bank's largest Arab town at a time of such tension. </p> <p>Palestinians accused the settlers of having started the trouble by shooting and killing a farmer picking olives on the rugged slopes of Mount Ebal - the second such incident in as many days. </p> <p>But the participants expressed no regrets.

His bullet-riddled body was found in a cave. </p> <p>Bitterly opposed to the Oslo peace process since it began in 1993, these highly-motivated and in some cases fanatical people insist they will fight to stay in what they see as God-given land. </p> <p>And with all the fire and fury of true believers anywhere, they have been quick to accuse successive Israeli governments of betraying them and appeasing their worst enemies. </p> <p>Daniella Weiss, one of their leading spokespeople, accused the army of abandoning the hiking party under fire on Thursday because the prime minister, Ehud Barak, was trying too hard to abide by this week's Sharm al-Sheikh summit call for a ceasefire. </p> <p>Many of the 200,000 settlers feel this is their darkest hour since the 1967 war, when Israel's capture of the West Bank from Jordan was followed by the creation of new outposts, often set up provocatively close to Palestinian towns and villages. </p> <p>But settlements that began 30 years ago as a few caravans and a generator on a lonely hilltop have now become small towns thanks to land confiscations, purchases through shadowy middlemen and cheap mortgages that attracted young couples, many of whom continue to commute across the \"green line\" into Israel proper. </p> <p>The largest of the 145 settlements are probably close enough to the old border, or in large enough contiguous blocs, to be annexed to Israel in any final peace deal. But the more isolated outposts - including most of those in the Nablus area, which tend to attract highly committed ideologues - would have to go. </p> <p>It is these hardliners who have regularly attacked Palestinians, often after stones have been thrown or shots fired at their vehicles on lonely roads. Tension is extremely high. </p> <p>Some of the extremists are supporters of Meir Kahane, an American-born rabbi - later murdered by an Egyptian in the US - who called openly for the expulsion of all Arabs from Israel and the West Bank. Placards saying \"Kahane was right\" can be seen plastered all over the country at the moment. </p> <p>It was the hothouse atmos phere of ideological opposition to any concessions to the Arabs that bred Yigal Amir, who assassinated the former prime minister Yitzhak Rabin, the architect of Oslo, in 1995. </p> <p>Palestinian leaders accuse settlers of repeated acts of violence, and call openly for attacks against them. </p> <p>On Thursday Hebrew graffiti insulting the prophet Mohammed was discovered in Hebron, a centre for some of the most uncompromising extremists. </p> <p>Violence is in the air as Oslo dies its slow death. Israel's Peace Now movement warns that it is not enough to demand the disarmament of Palestinian militias, but says the Jewish settlers must surrender their weapons too.</p>",
  "As I write, early in the month, it seems to me that autumn colour is developing late this year. With our own natives, most of which colour quite modestly, I usually reckon the last week of October and first week of November to see the peak, but many of our most glamorous introductions from Japan and North America do it a good deal earlier. The single pink ornamental cherry Prunus sargentii, for instance, often peaks in September. <p>Exciting though autumn conflagrations are, a few points are worth bearing in mind before making choices for one's own garden. One is that the amount of colour produced may vary a lot from year to year. Climatic factors affect this situation and there's nothing we can do to alter them. Combine this with the fact that the colour, if it does materialise, may last for the inside of two weeks and it becomes obvious that a plant - particularly a bulky one, or even a tree - is not worth choosing for autumn colour alone. It needs to give us pleasure in other ways at other seasons. </p> <p> Viburnum lantanoides (syn. V. alnifolium), for instance, a large, shapeless shrub and singularly boring for most of the year, can hardly deserve inclusion except in the largest of settings, just for its brief autumn brilliance. I also have my doubts about the genus Fothergilla, although many a gardener has got carried away by its display when visiting one of the large gardens noted for their spectacular fall colour. Admittedly it carries poufs of pale, yellowish, scented (but not outstandingly scented) flowers in spring, but that doesn't amount to much, and the leaf shape simply is not trying. </p> <p>By contrast, most maples (acer), with their palmate, sharply-pointed leaf structure, revel in this excellent feature throughout the summer, although one might be forgiven for omitting the sycamore, Acer pseudoplatanus. Some of the Japanese maples, named cultivars of A. palmatum and A. japonicum (among others), make delightful small specimen trees, if your conditions suit them - acid soil and reasonable protection from wind. When they colour in autumn, I always feel that the best moment is reached before the entire leaf is red (or yellow) but while the veins are still green. The effect is more interesting for being less homogeneous than when the entire leaf and all the leaves are a solid block of one colour. </p> <p>The botanists have been making hay with name changes in these Japanese maples but one of the best, in my opinion, is widely known as A. palmatum 'Senkaki' (now 'Sango-kaku'). Besides making a pretty little tree with neat foliage, it turns to clear yellow in fall and then, in winter, reveals its bright pink young stems. Where space is limited, I would (if you don't mind a somewhat chunky, fastigiate habit) recommend A. palmatum 'Shishigashira', with crimped, almost parsley-like dark green foliage changing in November to rich shades of burnt orange. This is good where space is limited. </p> <p>When a tree or shrub is bought with a clonal name, you should be safe with regard to its colour potential in areas where that is well known to be a primary consideration. Thus, with Liquidambar styraciflua - a tall tree with maple-like leaves - the cultivars 'Lane Roberts' and 'Worplesdon', both holders of the RHS Award of Garden Merit, will not let you down as autumn colourers. However, seedlings, which are easily raised, often fail to colour at all throughout their long lives. It often pays to buy your plant \"on the hoof\" and at the season, just before leaf fall, when high colour is to be expected. Admittedly, if pot-grown and pot-bound, that is to say rather starved, it may colour more highly than would be normal given a free root run, but at least you will know that the plant is capable of colouring well, whereas others may never be. </p> <p>That is the way I should choose a Virginia creeper. Avoiding the magenta-colouring, glossy-leaved Parthenocissus tricuspidata , which is the most widely planted species but a coarse thing, I would go for P. quinquefolia (in which each leaf has five separate fingers), or the smaller P. henryana. </p> <p>It is the same with that handsome, giant vine, Vitis coignetiae. Buy a plant that you can see is able to develop the desired rose-red colouring. A great advantage in this vine is that it starts colouring early and then continues for many weeks before finally shedding its foliage. It has great vigour if well fed and watered at the root and never looks better than growing over the dark, rich green of a common ivy - say up an old ash tree. But if given dry, dusty conditions full of competing roots, it can never make a go of it. </p> <p>One of the most popular hawthorns for its clusters of dark red berries as well as for its fall leaf colour is the American Crataegus persimilis 'Prunifolia', but there are sometimes complaints that its leaves fail to colour. In my experience this happens when its crop of haws is exceptionally heavy. The tree is exhausted and its leaves, considerably reduced in size and numbers, just drop off without any attempt at colour. However, when the fruit crop is light or moderate, a fine foliar display with yellows, orange and reds, can be expected. We mustn't be greedy.</p>",
  "Parents everywhere will know just what Carolyn and Matt Smith are going through: \"Problem: my children won't eat anything but peanut butter sandwiches, pizza and sweet-and-sour chicken,\" Carolyn wrote to Rosie Sykes, Kitchen Doctor. \"Could you get them to eat a more varied diet - including vegetables?\" <p>Now, the \"varied\" part of that plea was easy enough to deal with, thought Rosie: simply incorporate the flavours they like into a range of new dishes. But the vegetables were another matter - the combination of children and the green stuff is a minefield at the best of times, and Rosie, being unfamiliar with the black arts of child-rearing, couldn't get her head around how you go about persuading uncooperative kids that veg: a) aren't poisonous; and b) can actually be edible. Then she had the brainwave that has, at some time or other, come to all parents: offer a reward (aka, bribe) for eating their greens. </p> <p>Even so, when Rosie rolled up at the Smiths' country cottage in Wixford, near Stratford-upon-Avon, she was confident that she had this particular culinary crisis licked: she would offer Claira, eight, and Hatty, 12 going on 13, three main dishes - Malay pancakes, fried fish with vegetable r\u00f6sti, and vegetable frittata - followed by two puds, one of them so full of chocolate that it would silence even the sweetest-toothed of kids. </p> <p>Or at least that was the idea, until Carolyn brought Rosie back to earth by explaining how Claira deals with food that she doesn't like (that's \"like\" as in \"has never tasted before\"). \"She won't even try it,\" sighed Carolyn on the way back from picking up supplies at nearby Crabtree Farm Nurseries. \"She'll sort of dip her fork into the dish, raise it to her lips, make a pathetic impersonation of tasting it, and then say, 'See, it's horrible.'\" </p> <p>Back at the house, Rosie busied herself peeling and chopping - and having second thoughts. \"I usually do a print-out of the recipes, so you can make them after I'm gone,\" she told Carolyn, \"but I don't know how this is going to come together, so I haven't written anything down.\" </p> <p>\"You're making it up on the spot?\" said Carolyn incredulously, experience having taught her that making food for her kids without a strategy was somewhat foolhardy. </p> <p>\"I think I'll take a deep breath and rethink,\" Rosie said to no one in particular. Seconds later, a look of utter determination replaced red-cheeked fluster, and she set about her task with renewed vigour. Halfway through, Matt popped his head into the kitchen to say hello, then wisely went off to put up his feet until the children got home from school. </p> <p>Hatty turned up first, offered that mumbled greeting common to all near-teenagers, complained about a classmate (\"She smells, and everyone hates her\") and promptly disappeared to her room. \"I hope she doesn't put on that Marilyn Manson T-shirt,\" said Carolyn. Soon after, Claira arrived, announcing herself with the news that \"Sophie wants me to save her a piece of cake\". </p> <p>There was no putting off Rosie's big test any longer. \"I'm not usually this mayhemmy,\" she said, surveying the mess she'd made of the kitchen as she brought out the main dishes. \"The pancakes are because you like sweet-and-sour and peanuts, so something Malaysian seemed a good idea. You spread on the sauce, then lay in lettuce, chicken and lots of vegetables - hopefully.\" </p> <p>\"Do you want me to put sauce on for you?\" Carolyn asked Claira. </p> <p>\"I can do it myself.\" </p> <p>\"Some beans?\" </p> <p>\"No.\" </p> <p>\"Go on,\" begged Rosie. </p> <p>\"Okay, but not many.\" </p> <p>Then came the moment of truth: Claira lifted the pancake to her mouth and took a tentative bite. \"It's spicy,\" she said. </p> <p>\"Don't spit it out like that,\" said Carolyn as Claira's first mouthful found its way back to her plate. </p> <p>\"But the onion's spicy.\" </p> <p>\"You eat pickled onions, though, and they're very spicy.\" </p> <p>\"What's wrong with pickled onions?\" came the riposte, to which there wasn't really an answer. Claira took another bite. And swallowed it. Things were looking up. </p> <p>Hatty, meanwhile, had made short work of her pancake, so Rosie decided it was worth pushing her luck: \"Fancy some frittata with vegetables ... er, unmentionables?\" </p> <p>\"Okay,\" said Hatty, as Claira made a bid for freedom by claiming she needed the loo. Mum stopped her in her tracks by revealing that \"it's similar to tortilla, which you really liked in Spain\". </p> <p>Claira picked a pinenut off the top, eyed it suspiciously, then asked, \"Is this a bean? I don't like beans.\" </p> <p>\"No,\" said Rosie. \"You've had your bean quota for the day. It's a nut.\" </p> <p>\"And is that green stuff seaweed?\" grimaced Claira, now looking for any excuse. </p> <p>\"Would I do that?\" countered Rosie, slowly getting the hang of this battle of wills. \"It's spinach.\" </p> <p>Dad Matt stepped in to rescue Rosie from Claira's inquisition. \"This fish is fantastic,\" he said. \"And the r\u00f6sti. Do you want to try one?\" </p> <p>\"Are they like roast potatoes?\" </p> <p>\"More a mixture of roast potatoes and chips,\" lied Rosie, hoping that the presence of carrot, swede and parsnip would remain undetected by Claira's novice tastebuds. </p> <p>\"It's quite nice, in fact,\" declared Claira authoritatively. </p> <p>And that left puddings, the easiest part of Rosie's task, consisting of the aforementioned \"bribe\", a ridiculously rich chocolate cheesecake, and a healthier combo of fruit, oats and Greek yoghurt. Needless to say, Claira and Hatty ate more of the former, but seeing as they'd already put away far more than they did at normal meals, no one was complaining. </p> <p>As Rosie relaxed for the first time, Matt reiterated the dilemma: \"One of the problems with being a parent in this situation is that there isn't really a foodstuff that I don't like.\" </p> <p>\"Yes there is,\" interrupted Claira. </p> <p>\"Go on then, what?\" said Matt. </p> <p>\"Knickerbocker glory.\" </p> <p> All recipes serve four. </p> <p> </p> <p><b> Baked frittata </b><br> </p> <p> 30g butter </p> <p>2 tbsp olive oil </p> <p>6 eggs </p> <p>1 red onion, peeled and finely sliced </p> <p>2 courgettes, halved lengthways and sliced </p> <p>500g spinach, washed, destalked and roughly torn </p> <p>2 sprigs fresh basil </p> <p>180ml milk </p> <p>2 tomatoes, blanched, peeled, seeded and diced </p> <p>2 tbsp wheatgerm </p> <p>4 tbsp fresh breadcrumbs </p> <p>30g pinenuts </p> <p>30g sunflower seeds </p> <p>2 tbsp Parmesan </p> <p>2 tbsp Gruy\u00e8re</p> <p>Preheat the oven to 150C/300F/gas mark 2.
