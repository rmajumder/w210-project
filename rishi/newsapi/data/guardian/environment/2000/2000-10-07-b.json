  "<p>How the mighty are falling. Despite this year's collapse in technology stocks, the fast-moving newcomers still boast market capitalisations hugely above those of the old grandees of world business. Cisco Systems, for a spectacular instance, is worth 50 per cent more than General Motors, IBM, Eastman Kodak and Gillette put together. </p> <p>Objectors might protest that this merely expresses the difference between an other-worldly price-earnings ratio and reality. But the statistic also tells an unflattering truth about the giants. They have lost the effortless supremacy - based on global spread, unlimited wealth, invincible brands and touchingly loyal customers - which they once so richly enjoyed. Instead, they must battle to defend their markets and their margins against pressures, including new competition, over which they have no control. Some resort to mergers and acquisitions in self-defence, which may well double their trouble. Some seek to transform their creaking empires into powerhouses of modern management, at which most fail lamentably. </p> <p>General Motors is striving to develop e-commerce. But its profits are poor, its market share limp and its European returns pitiful. In the same industry, Daimler-Benz bought Chrysler (and double-trouble) while changing spectacularly from luxury supplier to manufacturer of everything from whacky Smart runabouts to lush lim ousines. Its latest profits are down by 30 per cent. At Kodak, Xerox and Procter &amp; Gamble, chief executive officers have left after proving unable to crack severe marketplace problems. The same fate has just overtaken Peter Salsbury at Marks &amp; Spencer. Why do these once-mighty management machines find it so desperately difficult to extricate themselves from stagnation? </p> <p>One reason is the depth of the holes that they and/or their predecessors have dug. Kodak's loss of market share to Fuji, and its failure to develop new businesses, turned it from leader to follower; sales fell by a quarter over the Nineties. The hole-diggers customarily ignore the shifting earth beneath their feet - just as the Dome's progenitors brushed aside consultants who doubted the absurd visitor forecasts. </p> <p>Many a private Dome has been built inside these mega-corporations - such as Kodak's forlorn foray into drugs, or Quaker Oats' 1997 \u00a3300 million sale of Snapple (Cadbury Schweppes' latest tipple), three years after a $1.7 billion purchase. Each costly blunder savages a firm's Economic Value Added - the vital difference between capital's cost and its return. Blow $1.4bn for a negative return, and you've created a permanent drag on the finances. When reality creeps (or crashes) in, boards commonly conclude that only a new broom will sweep clean enough. Kodak chose George Fisher for his record at Motorola (now itself troubled). His magic failed. In any event, a new CEO is not enough: replacing the top banana doesn't change a whole overripe bunch. </p> <p>Senior managers customarily complain about resistance to change among the lowest orders. In fact, resistance among middle managers is both stronger and harder to eradicate. Many are wedded to the post and fearful for their jobs (often with reason). But their conservatism is generally outdone by their seniors. Top executives not only lived under the previous dispensation: they created it. Even Tony Blair, vaguely admitting responsibility for the Dome, is a model of outspoken self-criticism compared with the self-delusion of the typical authors of corporate failure. </p> <p>The problem with denial is that it delays response - and slow reactions invariably make bad much worse. That is why the over-familiar Supertanker Myth is so dangerous. Corporate captains like to compare their vessels with bulk oil carriers that can only turn at lugubrious speeds. That misses the crucial point. The transformation that they need changes the supertanker into a fleet of smaller, fast-moving (and fast-turning) motor boats. This metaphor was actually used by Heinrich von Pierer, CEO of Siemens, to explain his plans for corporate revolution. Three years on, his flotilla is no more impressive than the supertanker it supposedly replaced, earning half of Hewlett-Packard's profits on 50 per cent more sales. As the Siemens example shows, the groaning of the greats is heard in high technology as well as low, and for the same basic reason. Speedboats and supertankers need wholly different crews. </p> <p>What can GM shareholders expect from new CEO, Richard Wagoner, who is a 23-year veteran? What can Wagoner expect when he calls on other veteran managers to 'shake off GM's complacent, cautious traditions and take more risks'? You can only sympathise with the analyst who told the Wall Street Journal that, without someone to pressurise slow-moving management, 'there's no such thing as a price earnings ratio too low for a company [GM] with these kinds of characteristics'. </p> <p>Speed is of the essence. Yet the departed CEO of P&amp;G was berated for trying to force through too much change too fast. His company's 'restructuring' programme, however, is a five-year marathon - excessively long in any era, but an eternity in the Age of the Internet. Twenty years ago, Jack Welch started turning General Electric around with remarkable speed and legendary success, only to conclude that he should have moved faster still. Unless change comes fast and runs swift and deep, mega-companies will go on limping from one stage of underperformance to the next. </p> <p>The purple passages in between serve only to delude. Restructuring, the euphemism for closures, cutbacks and lay-offs, always pays dividends in the short to medium-term. True transformation, however, will not be achieved unless everybody in all the businesses supports the strategy and its purpose, and is fully and personally involved in its execution - from bottom to top. Note the inversion. At the top, those who have the power are powerless to create change, except by genuinely devolving and sharing that power. Mostly they won't. And that's the great (and the greats') problem. </p> <p> Robert Heller's latest book, 'Riding the Revolution', written with Paul Spenley, is published by Harper Collins.</p>",
  "<p>A decade ago Timothy Mo left London for a short trip to east Asia. Since then, the thrice Booker-shortlisted author has spent no more than five months in Britain. \"At 20 I thought I'd live the rest of my life here,\" he says. \"But England isn't the centre any more. What's interesting about these times, and what I write about, is the clash of cultures, the war of civilisations.\" </p> <p>Mo, whose Cantonese father and English mother moved from Hong Kong to London when he was 10, was hailed as a rising literary star of the 1980s alongside Martin Amis, Salman Rushdie and Kazuo Ishiguro. His debut after Oxford, The Monkey King (1978), was a post-war Hong Kong comedy of manners, whose Mr Poon, with his gold stashed up a chimney, was modelled on Mo's grandfather - \"the only person I ever put absolutely from life in a novel\". His next novel, Sour Sweet (1982), trawled Hong Kong migrant life in Soho's Chinatown, and in An Insular Possession (1986), he looked at deeper Anglo-Chinese conflict in 19th-century Hong Kong. </p> <p>In his house in Holland Park, Mo says he finds Britain \"antiseptic - a slow, safe, orderly society\", and is more interested in societies \"glowing with decay ... I feel so much more at home in an Asian street: people smile, everybody's about my size - that was obviously nagging at me subliminally\". Each year he spends \"three months in Hong Kong; four split between Bangkok and Phnom Penh; and five in the Philippines\", travelling with his Filipina partner, Lisa, and their seven-year-old daughter, Marie. </p> <p>His fictional terrain has expanded partly through an evolving intimacy with Asia. The Redundancy of Courage (1991), on Indonesian genocide and guerrilla resistance in a veiled East Timor, was shortlisted for the Booker, as were his previous two novels. But it shocked some critics in abandoning what one termed \"quaint ethnic vignettes\" for \"violent polemic\". Mo attributes his leap to growing confidence, rejecting the pressure to \"stay in my box\". </p> <p>A former amateur bantam-weight boxer and fight reporter with an abiding passion for diving, he was perhaps too neatly accused of pugnacity when attacked for self-publishing his fifth novel, Brownout on Breadfruit Boulevard (1995). A Swiftian, scatological satire on corruption in the Philippines, it came out from his own Paddleless Press. Hectored for demanding inflated advances, he talked of \"casting pearls before swine\", but he has no regrets. \"I jumped before I was pushed. Multinationals will just stop publishing literary fiction. I'll never go back to being published by anyone else.\" </p> <p>His sixth and most recent novel, Renegade or Halo 2, which won the James Tait Black memorial prize, also opens in the Philippines, in the Marcos era, but grows into a 20th-century migrant's picaresque, spanning Asia, the Gulf emirates and Cuba, via Plaistow. Packed with action - much of it chillingly brutal - it is propelled less by plot than by sizzling prose. </p> <p>In its vivid tales of boat people and stowaways, the novel suggests first-hand experience of a global underclass of migrants - often the detritus of empire - who live several lifetimes in one. \"I've had to knock around with people who live strange zig-zag lives and have been marooned by the tide,\" says Mo. \"Seamen, domestics, boxers - people very much of this time.\" While Sour Sweet was compared to Dickens, Renegade nods to the \"ghosts of Fielding and Sterne\". </p> <p>Like the author, Renegade 's picaro, Rey Castro, embodies a collision of genes and histories. The Jesuit-educated, \"African-American-Filipino\" offspring of a bar girl and a black serviceman from the US naval base, he feels \"out of context\" everywhere. Yet he calls himself after a multicoloured local dessert, halo-halo: \"ingredients that shouldn't belong together but work when you combine them [like] candied napalm\". </p> <p>Mo himself feels \"mixed\" only in his work. \"If I'm with English people, I feel a little white man, while with my Chinese family I feel an Asian. But as a novelist, the parts have combined.\" Renegade 's compelling comic voice fuses American slang with pinoy patois and the Tagalog hybrid \"Taglish\". </p> <p>While Renegade won critical praise, it apparently split last year's Booker judges, the women refusing to countenance it on the shortlist, not least for a graphic rape-murder by Filipino fraternity \"Frat Brods\" in which Rey is uneasily complicit. Mo defends the scene as a \"regular occurrence, where rich sons of powerful people get together and rape, often murder, a poor girl; it's not just my warped imagination. I'm interested in moral dilemmas: the cultural imperative is you stick by your group, which Rey does but is haunted by it; [the girl's] ghost haunts the novel\". The book, he adds, is \"a critique of social culture; it's a weakness of south-east Asian societies that the rich should be able to abuse the poor\". </p> <p>Some thought the novel marred by provocative stereotypes - the pilfering Filipino, the lubricious Cubana. \"I'm not frightened of the word stereotype,\" says Mo. \"It's a survival blueprint: groups behave in predictable ways. But it's important to have an open mind and be ready to modify your opinion. Race and cultural differences are a great 20th-century taboo. But it is possible to make value judgments.\" </p> <p>While the author-publisher frets that \"the days of the physical book are numbered\", he says: \"Some say I don't have a natural readership for my themes. But I console myself I will years from now: there'll be more halo-halos like myself.\" </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,501190357,00.htm\">Buy Brownout on Breadfruit Boulevard at BOL</a><br>501190357</p>",
  "<p><strong> Monday, October 2, Eddie's Tea Bar, Cement Works, Leicestershire</strong> </p> <p>I am on my break and am sitting on a white plastic chair, writing on a matching picnic table. I am surrounded by lorry drivers and motorists. It is only 11.30am, but I am already exhausted. I have been on my feet since 5am (though, to be strictly honest, and at the risk of being labelled \"pedant\", I did sit down in the car during the journey here). </p> <p>Eddie and his third wife, Sandra, were already here and the urn was warming up, as were the deep-fat fryers and the griddle. Eddie and Sandra seem to have fat running through their bloodstreams. Their hair, skin and pores seem to be clogged with it. Eddie said to me, as he gave me a huge wrap-around apron, \"You'll never shake off the stink of the fat, lad. It makes it 'ard to get a woman outside the trade.\" All Eddies wives have been in the frying business, apparently. I reassured him that I was not actively seeking a woman at the moment, and told him that I was due to start a course at the adult education centre in Leicester called Living Without A Partner. He looked at me, pityingly, and asked quietly whether I had \"Somethink wrong under yer clothes\". </p> <p>I reassured Eddie that I was made as other men were made, but that my heart had been broken a few times recently and needed time to recover. Eddie lifted the spatula off the sizzling bacon slices and said, \"I get bad headaches if I don't have a bit of sausage-hiding once a day, don't I Sandra?\" </p> <p>Sandra tucked a strand of oily hair behind an ear and said, \"'E was on a box of Nurofen every 24 hours when I went in the General to have my veins done.\" Eddie shook his head and gazed into the middle distance where the lorries were parked, obviously re-living the horrors of sexual deprivation. </p> <p>I phoned my mother to ask how the child-care arrangements had gone this morning. She said, \"Badly, I can't get up and come to your house at five every morning. I'm falling asleep at the wheel.\" I pointed out to her that day nurseries don't open until 7am and begged her to continue. She said bitterly, \"I blame Tony Blair and Jack Straw for this. Why should grandmas have to be dragged in to look after their grandkids, eh? I've already served my sentence with you and your sister.\" </p> <p>She made me and my sibling's upbringing sound a joyless business. I asked how her new husband, Ivan, was doing in the mental hospital. \"He's developed an aversion to all things technological,\" she said. \"A male nurse used an electronic Ronson to light a patient's birthday cake and Ivan had to be sedated.\" I wondered if Ivan \"techno\" Braithwaite would be capable ever again of coping with the modern world. </p> <p> <strong> Tuesday, October 3, Ashby-de-la-Zouch</strong> </p> <p>DH Lawrence, my literary hero, enjoyed working with his hands and reputedly took a pride in his jam-making. I, too, have discovered the small joys of manual labour. I like to think that DH would have been proud of me as I serve up a bacon 'n' egg sandwich to our first customer, Les, who was driving an Eddie Stobbart lorry full of mineral water from Liskeard to Dundee. Though I say it myself, Les's sandwich was a work of art. The bacon was succulent, the egg was cooked sensitively, so as to prevent yolk leakage, and the bread was as white and soft as a newly-hatched maggot. I was quietly pleased when Les pronounced it to be \"champion\". </p> <p> <strong> Friday, October 6</strong> </p> <p>Couldn't sleep for wondering about the necessity of hauling mineral water from Liskeard to Dundee. Scotland is awash with the stuff. </p> <p> <strong> Saturday, October 7</strong> </p> <p>Living Without A Partner has been cancelled. I was the only one to turn up.</p>",
  "<p>The dining room at the Crown was empty that particular lunchtime. The petrol blockades were at their height, which didn't help, and then there was the position of the Crown itself, tucked away in one of the clefts that seam the steep, heavily wooded sides of the Wye valley, south-west of Monmouth. </p> <p>You have to work at getting to the Crown, and so, if you're a bit doubtful about the petrol supplies, you could be tempted to give this lunchtime's beanfeast a miss on the grounds that you might make it there, but you might not make it back again. </p> <p>Not that to have to stay over would be a disaster, because the Crown advertises itself as a restaurant with rooms, a pleasantly old-fashioned and rather French notion. It suggests that the emphasis is on the food rather than the frills and furbelows of modern hoteliery, and while I like my bedtime comforts as well as the next sleeper, I like the comforts of the table even more. Anyway, I don't suppose that the Crown was too disturbed by not being overrun one lunchtime in a while. When you have survived 30 or so years in such a position, you must be used to every vicissitude in the trade. </p> <p>This length of service gives the Crown a certain gravitas, a calm certainty about what it is up to. The beamed dining room, for example, is pleasant and proper, neither cloddishly rustic or oppressively smart. The basics of tablecloths, napkins, glasses all have the weight and heft of fine quality, but the service has a fresh and personable charm. I might be the only person in the place, but I didn't feel like a sad solitary. Lunch trickled by in an agreeable fashion, my reading of the day's paper broken by the intermittent arrival of courses. </p> <p>Mark Turton, the Crown's chef, is a graduate of the Roux brothers' school of culinary excellence. The Roux brothers were - indeed, still are - sticklers for the basics. Their cooking is founded on the classics principles of la cuisine Fran\u00e7aise: sauces are based on stocks; meat is served pink; vegetables play second (if not third or fourth) fiddle to the big protein number; pastry is an art form. The dishes have a certain - what shall we say? - weight to them: handsome Victorian mahogany rather than lightweight bleached pine Ikea. You do not look to the Roux brothers, or to their disciples, for novelty or fantasy. </p> <p>But then, novelty or fantasy would not suit the Crown one little bit. So I had three courses of highly satisfying, mostly beautifully prepared food from a menu that generously offered two courses for \u00a312.95 and three for \u00a315.95. The three courses were a ravioli of leek and St David's cheese in a wild mushroom risotto with a beurre blanc sauce; noisette of lamb with spinach pancakes and walnut jus; and savarin soaked in strawberry syrup with a warm fruit compote. </p> <p>Now, there's nothing startling about that lot. You could argue that a chap eating on his own could not explore the full majesty of the menu, and, of course, you'd be right. But it isn't my intention to explore the full majesty of any menu, but to replicate, as far as is possible, the experience of anyone walking in off the hills. Anyway, when you've been eating 200 or so restaurant meals a year for 10 years, you know what a chef's cooking is like from the way he lays out a menu. Don't ask me why, but you just do. </p> <p>The first course was disarmingly rich, a very French interpretation of Italian cooking, making use of local ingredients. The ravioli was a fine piece of pasta, cooked to teasingly soft perfection, the leek dominating the cheese. I rather doubt that the rice in the risotto was the traditional arborio, but it was generously larded with diced wild mushrooms, which tasted as if they might, indeed, have grown underneath a tree rather than a polytunnel. And the beurre blanc was a model of that sauce, gently astringent and silky with butter. </p> <p>The lamb dish continued this level of cheerful indulgence. The lamb was local, and carried plenty of colour in terms of flavour. It needed all of that to stand up to an almost intimidating sauce based on a red-wine reduction given further clout by chopped walnuts. The half-bottle of warming Gigondas to which I limited myself had the measure of the dish perfectly. The pancakes suffered a little in this taste blitzkrieg, but had their part to play. I wasn't convinced that a side issue of six further vegetables - namely, red cabbage, gratin dauphinois, carrots, courgette and celeriac batons in a filo basket, and French beans - really did, even though they were adequately cooked. It was the kind of supernumerary dish demanded by local clientele rather than by the kitchen. </p> <p>But the savarin was a serious disappointment. The strawberry syrup had reduced the delicate sponge to a soggy wodge, made soggier still by the warm fruit compote. Perhaps I should have had the chocolate and caramel pannacotta with dark chocolate sorbet recommended by my cheerful waitress. </p> <p>The bill was \u00a330.65. The food had chipped in at the advertised \u00a315.95. The Gigondas contributed \u00a311.50, and water, coffee, etc, accounted for the rest. You can't quibble with the food costs. They are pretty reasonable, given the craftsmanship of the kitchen and the quiet quality of the place - even for the solitary luncher.</p>",
  "<p>A giant dome built at enormous cost, its reputation steadily destroyed by negative press and public criticism. Sound familiar? Predictably, a team of Americans got there ten years before the millennium. Rather than half-baked educational exhibits and contemporary dance, the Biosphere 2 project that they created contained representations of the world's different ecosystems and eight people who were sealed for two years in a Big Brother-esque incarceration experiment. </p> <p>Named after the thin envelope of life surrounding planet earth (Biosphere 1), this $200m, 3.1 acre greenhouse was designed to test the feasibility of people living in a self-sustaining sealed environment on Mars. </p> <p>As Big Brother viewers might have guessed, the project told us more about human psychology than it did about our prospects of opening bars on Mars. The newspapers ran reports of smuggled-in food and printed salacious details of personality clashes under the glass. </p> <p>Large numbers of species died out and Biosphere 2 was written off as an expensive scientific flop. The only lesson to emerge was that the earth's natural life-sustaining systems cannot be artificially engineered, so we ought to look after the ones we have got. </p> <p>Yet Columbia University spotted the potential of an enclosed space with five different biomes (including a dense rainforest and a reef) and an atmosphere that could be manipulated and measured. Real world climate change research is continually dogged by a lack of control over the enormously complex global climate; here was a unique 'model earth' that could be used to investigate the real effects of rising carbon dioxide levels on living systems. Columbia took a leap of faith in 1996 and agreed to take over the project as a western outpost of its New York city campus. </p> <p>Why are we here? Antonia Williamson and I are the two lucky readers chosen by Rise and Volvo Car Corporation to come to the Arizona desert and learn about the environment as part of the 'earth semester' which Columbia University runs at Biosphere 2. As befits a place with such a colourful history, this course offers students an exciting and unusual environment in which to learn. </p> <p>As course director Debra Colodner points out: \"The aim is to introduce students to the idea that the solution to real world environmental problems has to come from many different disciplines working together.\" </p> <p>Students are shuttled from geology to biology with stops for global economics and a glance back at the history of human exploitation of the environment. The result is a whirl of ideas and thoughts that slowly cement into a better idea of why the world is as it is and how we can best manage its future. </p> <p>At all times the futuristic silhouette of Biosphere 2 looms large in the background, but today its main inhabitants are cockroaches, hordes of ants, and teams of scientists who are allowed to go home to their families every evening. </p> <p>A trip under the glass with these scientists is an awe-inspiring experience; a visit to a secret garden that one moment looks, feels and smells like a tropical rainforest or thick savanna, and the next transports you to a subterranean tangle of pipes and tunnels. The scientists that have come to this place have gone out on a scientific limb, hoping that their participation in this living laboratory can change the way we investigate our environment. </p> <p>\"Biosphere 2 offers us the opportunity to do experimental research in a field that to date has been basically observational,\" says vice president and chief operating officer Marjorie Macfarlane. \"This greatly accelerates the learning process.\" </p> <p>The unique experiments are revealing some interesting preliminary findings about the way in which ecosystems respond to higher carbon dioxide levels. For instance, ratcheting up the carbon dioxide level above the 'ocean' biome suggests that corals will suffer in a high CO 2 future, as oceans become acidified to the point where they can no longer make their hard skeletons (so book your scuba holiday soon). </p> <p>The pioneers of Biosphere 2 have their own solution to a deteriorating environment and they continue their plans for Mars habitation elsewhere; meanwhile the scientists who have taken over the facility seem anxious to distance themselves from its outlandish history. </p> <p>Their research does not hit the headlines like a mission to Mars, but it could be much more valuable. By fitting small pieces of knowledge into the jigsaw, the scientists might just give us a vision of the future that finally eclipses the Biosphere 2 project's bizarre past. </p> <p>\u0095 Ben Dixon, a Cambridge University zoology graduate and Antonia Williamson, a fine art graduate from the University of Leeds won the inaugural Volvo Environmental Scholarships, organised in association with Rise. Their prize was an all-expenses-paid semester at the Biosphere 2.</p>"
