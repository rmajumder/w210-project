  "<p>A collection of stories by Yiddish literature's most expert and beloved fabulist, Sholom Aleichem, ought, you would suppose, make perfect material for theatrical adaptation. Aleichem, after all, created the character of Tevye the Milkman, and the musical for which Tevye became the central figure, Fiddler on the Roof, became a record-setter on Broadway. </p> <p>And so, to some extent, it proves. Aleichem's stories, 11 of which are included in Saul Reichlin's one-man show, deal in the grubby, poverty-stricken small change of the Russian shtetls, at the last gasp of pre-Revolution isolation and victimisation. (Aleichem himself emigrated to the US in 1905, and died in New York in 1916.) Historical events intrude occasionally - the Dreyfus affair gets a couple of mentions - but as one of Reichlin's early selections, Dreyfus in Kasrilevkeh, makes clear, newsworthy events are remote and distant, in a wrong-end-of-the-telescope kind of way. </p> <p>No, Aleichem's world is the eternal shtetl that has been mythologised almost out of history: this is an environment that to all intents and purposes, saw no changes between 1690 and 1890. Aleichem's small-scale, homely narratives - in which a Jewish traveller picks up a tsarist officer's cap by mistake, or a harmless schnorrer (beggar), ironically nicknamed Rothschild, trips over a drunk shoemaker on a feast day - point up this sense of self-containment and self-sufficiency. That's why they make such good nostalgia too; Tevye and his ilk are sentimentalised icons of hopefulness, betterment, and vessels of good fortune - exactly the kind of qualities that have traditionally preoccupied successive Jewish generations, both before and since Aleichem's time. </p> <p>Reichlin has obvious affection for his material, and exercises considerable skill in giving voice to the multiplicity of characters that the inter-connected stories require. On the other hand, the tales cry out for a strongly visual staging - both in terms of performance and in stage hardware. Director Robert Longden, however, has chosen to go for basic, unchanging lighting; a painted stage, and a single samovar in the corner. Reichlin, despite his ability to spin a yarn, tends to the static, relying on his ability to connect with the audience and verbal dexterity to keep momentum going. Unfortunately, it doesn't always work: by second half, there's not much to distinguish it from a radio play. </p> <p>\u0095 Until September 3.

  "<p>Has the e-book arrived? This is the question nervous publishers have been asking themselves this week, after Microsoft unveiled the latest version of Microsoft Reader, the software for laptops, PCs and hand-held devices which aims to transfer the experience of reading from the written page to the computer screen.</p> <p>The move, described by Microsoft as equivalent to the creation of the first mass-produced motorcar, was timed to coincide with the launch of its eBookStore by the US internet bookseller <a href=\"http://www.bn.com\">Barnes &amp; Noble.com</a>. \"This is a major milestone for the publishing industry and book lovers alike,\" said Dick Brass, vice president for technology development at Microsoft. \"Anyone wondering about electronic reading needs only to spend some time with a good eBook on Microsoft Reader to see what the excitement is all about.\"</p> <p>Suggestions that the software could do to publishers what Napster and the MP3 have done to the music industry were rebutted by Microsoft, which said that it had joined up with the Association of American Publishers to fight digital piracy. The computer giant promised to put a \"significant financial endowment\" into creating new technology to identify illegal content on the net.</p> <p>In the US a number of publishers have jumped on the e-book bandwagon in recent months, including the giants Random House and Time Warner, both of which have established their own digital imprints. \"I believe that the eBook will change the whole notion of how we receive and enjoy information and entertainment,\" said a bullish Laurence Kirshbaum, chairman and CEO of Time Warner Trade Publishing.</p> <p>This latest \"major milestone\" was greeted with typical stiff upper lips in the UK, where publishers have yet to be convinced that the e-book will not go the same way as the ill-fated CD-rom.</p> <p>However, Microsoft's hyperbole aside, the fact that consumers the world over can now download books such as Michael Crichton's Disclosure or Kathy Reichs's Deadly Decisions for as little as $10 and read them using their preferred e-book software should not go unnoticed for too much longer in the UK. One of the books being heavily promoted by Barnes &amp; Noble.com, Jackie Collins's Lethal Seduction, will not be available in the UK in traditional book form until October. Replace Jackie Collins with JK Rowling and Lethal Seduction with Harry Potter Five and the potential threat is obvious.</p> <p>One British publisher which has decided to take a chance on e-books is the academic group Taylor &amp; Francis. They recently signed up with a US e-publishing company, Versaware, to publish new digital e-book formats alongside their conventional printed books. </p> <p>The company, whose imprints include Routledge and Garland, also intends to have an e-book version of its entire back catalogue by 2001. When asked why the group was taking this step now, managing director Roger Horton said \"the eBook is here, and the widespread use of the internet makes it much more accessible. We cannot continue to dip our toes into the digital stream... We had to take control of our content, its availability and distribution to position ourselves for the future.\" </p> <p> As if this was not enough for publishers, the Bookseller has reported that literary agents are also getting in on the act. According to the trade paper, Richard Gollner of Radala &amp; Associates is to publish The Wisdom of Crocodiles by Paul Hoffman on 29 August under his agency's own imprint, Big Time Press. According to Mr Gollner, the decision to publish was an experiment - but he warned that, with cheaper and easier printing methods now available, it was an experiment that could easily be repeated. In a show of net nous, the book - a section of which has already been made into an eponymous film starring Jude Law - is being promoted by a fiendishly difficult online competition at <a href=\"http://www.1234.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.1234.com</a>.</p> <p>Meanwhile, mind, body and spirit publisher Element, which has been suffering a long period of bad karma, could be about to join Fourth Estate at HarperCollins, Rupert Murdoch's rarely harmonic global publishing empire. The Bookseller reported that newly installed chief executive Victoria Barnsley has been courting the struggling purveyor of all things yin and yang. Ms Barnsley, it seems, would like to put it alongside HarperCollins' very own mind, body, spirit imprint, Thorsons.</p> <p>The rumour, if it proves to be true, should be of interest to Eileen Campbell, the publisher credited with being the inspiration behind Thorsons. Ms Campbell left HarperCollins earlier this year for Penguin, where her brief was to nurture a mind, body, spirit list. Penguin, which distributes Element's books in the UK, is thought to have backed away from an attempt to acquire Element itself.</p> <p>But then Penguin has been busy of late, not least in the company of lawyers. Fresh from the David Irving trial, the nation's favourite publisher has received a legal challenge from the owner of the domain name katie.com, after releasing a book in the US with the same title. The original Katie has been forced to take down her site and replace it with an <a href=\"http://www.katie.com\" target=\"_NEW\">open letter to Penguin</a>, in which she says that the book was originally to have been called girl.com - presumably until someone twigged that it was an address for adult content.</p> <p> It seems Penguin could face further legal problems arising from the closure of Dorling Kindersley Family Learning (DKFL), the direct-selling arm of the company acquired by Penguin earlier this year. According to a report in Publishing News, a number of DKFL distributors, who feel they have been left high and dry by Penguin's decision to close the unit, are exploring their legal options. The numbers involved were not disclosed, but there were more than 30,000 such distributors when the division was culled.</p> <p>But it has not been a wholly bad week for Penguin. The publisher has announced that it is bringing forward the publication of Sir Alec Guinness's last volume of diaries, the prophetically titled A Positively Final Appearance. The book was originally scheduled for late September publication, but has been brought forward a month in the wake of the actor's death. Copies could be in bookshops as early as this week.</p>",
  "<p>'Nasty' Nick Bateman's future on Big Brother was hanging in the balance this afternoon, after a confrontation with the other housemates left him in tears and waiting to hear if he would have to leave the show because of his duplicitous behaviour.</p> <p>Big Brother addicts following the Channel 4 real-life soap on the web were treated to extraordinary scenes this lunchtime, as Nick was accused by the other contestants of breaking the Big Brother rules by attempting to influence who got voted off the show each week.</p> <p>At a house meeting in the living area broadcast live on the Big Brother website, Nick repeatedly refused to admit the full extent of what he had been up to. Darren then brought out his suitcase from the bedroom and pulled out a number of pieces of paper with different housemates' names on them. </p> <p>Contestants in the house are banned from discussing their nominations for who should leave each week. </p> <p>The meeting then broke up and Nick took the suitcase back to the boys' bedroom and appeared to be packing his belongings. Mel urged him to talk to Big Brother, saying \"you can't walk out, it'll be hell for you out there it's the worst thing you could possibly do.\" </p> <p>Nick went to visit the Big Brother room and came back in tears. He and the other contestants were then left waiting to see what would happen next.</p> <p>Nick had been accused of showing pieces of paper with different pairs of names, purporting to show which contestants he was going to nominate for expulsion, to different contestants. Mel, Tom and Craig admitted having been shown names by Nick.</p> <p>Craig said during the increasingly stormy meeting: \"I feel insulted. I said to Big Brother that I felt like a fool. The only weak person in here is you - you've lowered yourself to this and it's backfired on you.\" Darren added: \"I can't believe you would do this. We're being watched by millions - you can't just run away. It's childish and pathetic.\"</p> <p>In a further meeting, Nick made a final and desperate attempt to stay in the house, by opening his heart to the seven remaining contestants.</p> <p>He said: \"I came from a very big family. I spent ten years at boarding school, where you have to fight, and I worked in a very competitive environment.</p> <p>\"It was a silly thing to do, but this environment brings out the competitive nature in all of us. We would all like to do as well as we would like to do.\"</p> <p>Nick added that leaving the house would be a coward's way out, though fellow contestants Nichola and Craig said he faced eviction next week anyway.</p> <p>Nichola said: \"We have lost all our trust in you. I am very angry and think you should go. You're a joke, living in a dream world.\"</p> <p>The link to the show's website which should have been running 24 hours a day went down for two hours today when it looked like there could have been a major confrontation. </p> <p>A Big Brother spokesman said: \"The online producer panicked and hit a panic button which brought the Internet down between 4am and 6am. </p> <p>\"It was a mistake, it shouldn't have happened and won't happen again.\" </p> <p>However, he added that it did not come to blows and Craig and Darren quietly seethed while they decided to hatch today's showdown. </p>",
  "<p>At midnight last Friday, a curious email arrived at Consumer. \"We are pleased to announce that from Monday August 13 Safeway will be increasing prices on all our goods by 25%,\" it read. \"If this doesn't sound good to you then you can piss off to another supermarket chain such as Tesco or Sainsbury's.\" Safeway says that the message, which was sent to hundreds of customers who had logged on to the store's website, is being investigated. A spokeswoman assures: \"It was not issued by the company and the information it contained is entirely false.\" As if anyone could have doubted it. </p> <p>A disgruntled insider is the likeliest culprit, but it would come as no surprise to the industry if it was found to be the work of a rival store. </p> <p>Supermarket customers are used to having their favours fought over in increasingly bloody price wars, but the battle is starting to get dirty. The provocation is the US group Wal-mart, which last year took over the Asda chain and announced that it would reduce 10,000 lines by up to 10%. Its rivals, with brave dignity, professed to welcome the challenge and set about shearing the pennies off prices. Then, as the cost began to tell, the facade slipped and the squabbling started. Tesco declared it could match any ropey old deal offered by Safeway; Asda, not to be outdone, said the same. Then Tesco blew raspberries at Iceland who responded with rude stickers in Tesco stores. </p> <p>Safeway, meanwhile, was plotting revenge. \"We've got a new chief executive and his strategy is based on stealing other people's customers,\" its spokeswoman, Emma Mason told Consumer in May. An internal memo, leaked last week to a tabloid newspaper, revealed that the management was instructing its staff to wreak havoc in rival stores in the hope that, if customers don't defect to Safeway, at least they'll emerge with less than pleasant memories of their usual port of call. \"Be one jump ahead,\" operations director John Douglas urges his staff in the document. \"Make sure you know what they're up to and cause as much confusion as you possibly can.\" </p> <p>By way of inspiration, Douglas cites a recent triumph at Castle Bromwich in the West Midlands when a Safeway store manager sent 10 staff undercover to Asda. They all arrived at the check-outs simultaneously and demanded that the store match Safeway prices. \"The queues on the other tills were about 45ft long and people were dumping their baskets and leaving,\" boasted Safeway's Castle Bromwich manager. \"One customer was given his frozen food all for nothing because he waited so long.\" </p> <p>Safeway admits that it has set its sights on its rival - \"Ooh, it's exciting stuff!\" breathes communications director Kevin Hawkins - but claims Asda was horrid first. \"Some weeks ago they targeted our stores and said they would match our special offers if customers produced one of our advertisements,\" says Hawkins. \"We knew this was implausible becase it's impossible for them to predict which items we'll discount each week and so they can't make sure they've got enough stock to meet demand.\" </p> <p>To help dry up the supplies, Safeway staff are dropping thousands of leaflets a week in Asda car parks, inviting customers to take advantage of the offer. \"We've caught them out many a time this way,\" says Hawkins. \"We've told our managers that if they want to send staff round to challenge Asda in person, they can.\" </p> <p>At Asda, spokesman Nick Agarwal can barely suppress his mirth. \"We're bemused and amused,\" he chortles. \"Our customers would be the first to say that Safeway's tactics are a tad childish.\" </p> <p>Gaggles of self-conscious Safeway infiltrators are apparently such a familiar sight at Asda stores that managers have started welcoming them over the public address system and offering them their own designated check-out. \"They're not very good at undercover operations and often forget to change out of their uniforms,\" says Agarwal. </p> <p>\"At Rawtenstall in Lancashire they could only muster four staff who were still in uniform. Our manager saw them huddled in the carpark in the rain and took pity on them and gave them an Asda umbrella under which to shelter. He has now set up a hotline to Safeway in his store so that customers can call up and tell them what they think of them.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile Safeway's hit squads have been goading Tesco after the latter promised to match Safeway's special offers in its Wells and Walsall stores. Customers will have found leaflets promoting the Tesco deal under their windscreens, put there by Safeway staff who hoped a run on the discounted goods would empty Tesco's shelves. \"We're delighted that they are going to all that trouble to do our marketing for us,\" says Karen Marshall of Tesco. It's intensely competitive out there, but we would never resort to such tactics.\" </p> <p>Oh no? In May Iceland went weeping to the Office of Fair Trading after Tesco launched a \u00a320m poster campaign claiming that its prices were cheaper. \"Clearly they feel threatened by us to target us in such an underhand manner,\" says Iceland's managing director, Russell Ford. \"They recently experienced their first year-on-year fall in sales for three years and are clearly feeling the pressure.\" Iceland retaliated by pasting stickers on Tesco's frozen food counters, which read: \"Pssst, it's cheaper at Iceland.\" </p> <p>Sainsbury's says it prefers the grown-up approach and leaves such juvenile cavortings to its rivals. \"We fight with competitive prices and good quality,\" says a spokesman. This did not prevent the group from trying to pull a fast one on Safeway. When the latter announced that it was scrapping its ABC loyalty card in May, Sainsbury's promised 500 free points to customers who traded in their card for its equivalent. </p> <p>Each supermarket group claims that the others are motivated by jealousy. \"We've acquired a million new customers in a year and are obviously hurting Asda,\" crows Hawkins. And according to Asda: \"Safeway's tactics are a compliment. They obviously see us as a threat.\" </p> <p>Tesco says its rivals are intimidated by its \u00a3380m investment in price cuts last year, while little Iceland believes its 16% share of the frozen food market has discomfited Tesco. However, beneath the bravado the supermarkets are running scared. \"We are a 300lb gorilla,\" warned Wal-Mart when it arrived in Britain last June, and the predictions are that it will consume whatever chains it can lay its hands on. At present, three quarters of the population buys its groceries from the Big Four - Safeway, Asda, Tesco and Sainsbury; the fear is that Wal-Mart, with its global purchasing power and sheer magnitude, will swallow their profits. </p> <p>For as long as the battle wages, it can only be good news for consumers. Prices will continue to drop as stores bribe shoppers for their custom. Now the gloves are off, the inter-store warfare is likely to become ever more diverting. </p> <p>\"Asda says our tactics don't hurt them, but they would, wouldn't they,\" says Hawkins. \"We will continue to target them for as long as it takes. It's tit for tat.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong> Back up </strong><br> What is the cheapest backup medium - Zip drives, rewriteable CD's, tape streamers? - and from whom?  <strong>Nigel Bruce</strong> <br> <a href=\"mailto:nigel@grove22.freeserve.co.uk\">nigel@grove22.freeserve.co.uk</a> </p> <p><strong> Jack Schofield:</strong> Ask me next year, because I'm optimistic about the progress of rewriteable DVD, or DVD-ram drives like the Panasonic LF-D103. </p> <p>Today, tape streamers are great for professionals, and I like the look of the Tecmar Travan NS20, but tapes don't appeal to home users. One possibility is a \"superdisk\" such as the Iomega Jaz drive or the similar Orb system. </p> <p>These can store 2GB per disk, but the disks are expensive. (Iomega's popular Zip disks, which hold 100MB or 250MB, are now too small for back-ups, and the disks are also too expensive.) CD writers are more attractive because they double up as CD players and let you create your own audio CDs. </p> <p>They are cheap to run: blank CD-R discs cost less than \u00a31, and rewriteable CDRW discs cost less than \u00a32 each. The problem is that one disc does not hold enough: typically 74 minutes of audio or 650MB of data. You would need 16 discs, and a lot of spare time, to back up a 10GB hard drive. </p> <p>DVD-ram drives can store 2.6GB on a single-sided disc costing about \u00a315. When the cost of drives comes down to \u00a3200 or less, and blank disc prices are also halved, they could be almost irresistible. </p> <p><strong> Why not MD? </strong><br> Is there any reason why it shouldn't be possible to back up PC files onto a recordable MiniDisc player and, if not, why doesn't this facility seem to be available?  <strong>John Arran</strong> <br> <a href=\"mailto:john.arran@eds.com\">john.arran@eds.com</a> </p> <p><strong> JS: </strong> MiniDiscs were designed to store audio data using a \"lossy\" compression system that Sony calls ATRAC (Adaptive TRansform Acoustic Coding). </p> <p>Unfortunately, \"lossy\" compression systems, which throw away data they think you can't see or hear, are no use for computer data where every bit counts. </p> <p>In 1993, however, Sony announced a suitable format called MD Data, and Sony and Sharp said they would have 650MB drives ready by 1997. This is only 4.6 times the capacity of a standard MiniDisc, so I expect Sony could have done it. </p> <p>But presumably they could not do it at a price competitive with CD-based systems. </p> <p><strong> Why not CD? </strong><br> I back up data files to floppy disk. I understand I can use a CD-R or CD-RW (rewriteable) drive, but CD files are \"Read-only\", and when copied back to the hard drive cannot be edited. Have I understood correctly? <strong> George Katritzky</strong> <br> <a href=\"mailto:gkatritzky@cwcom.net\">gkatritzky@cwcom.net</a> </p> <p><strong> JS:</strong> You can't edit files on a CD, not even on a rewriteable CD. However, if you copy a file from a CD to a hard drive, you can easily change the \"Read-only\" setting in Windows. </p> <p>Right-click on the file and select Properties. The Attributes section at the bottom of the sheet has a check-box to mark it Read-only. Uncheck it. </p> <p> <strong> Partition it </strong><br> My PC has a 27GB of hard drive, of which 25GB are unused. It was purchased with the primary objective of video editing with Pinnacle Systems' DV500, which stresses that part of the hard drive should be reserved exclusively for saving raw video footage. My problem is that I do not know how to separate part of the hard drive (15 or 20GB) or how to make it Drive E.  <strong>Ronald Foxwell</strong> <br> <a href=\"mailto:antiphonfoxford@care4free.net\">antiphonfoxford@care4free.net</a> </p> <p><strong> JS: </strong> The problem is that hard drive partitions are set up before any software is installed on a PC, and changing the drive with the DOS/Windows utilities Fdisk and Format will erase everything. The solution is a commercial program called Partition Magic 5.0 ( See <a href=\"http://www.powerquest.com/partitionmagic/\">www.powerquest.com/partitionmagic/</a>). I bought a copy and it is brilliant. There are also some free programs that do the same thing, such as <a href=\"http://www.users.intercom.com/~ranish/part/\">Mikhail Ranish's Partition Manager</a>. This is a very powerful program, but too hard for most of us to use. </p> <p><strong> Fixing flickers </strong><br> I want to change the display refresh rate on my PC (jitter on the new monitor), but in true Windows form, nowhere does it tell you how to do this.  <strong> K. Lillington</strong> <br> <a href=\"mailto:karlin@indigo.ie\">karlin@indigo.ie</a> </p> <p><strong> JS: </strong> Windows may be cagey because setting too high a refresh rate can damage the monitor. It will therefore set a conservative (too low) refresh rate if it does not know what the monitor is, and will not let you increase it. </p> <p>To check, right-click on the desktop and select Properties, then go to the Settings tab and click the Advanced button in the lower right hand corner. Look at the Monitor sheet and see if Windows recognises your monitor. If not, try to find the appropriate .inf (information) file, which may be on a floppy disk supplied with your system, or may be downloaded from the supplier's website. </p> <p>Now go to the Adapter sheet and see if Windows knows which graphics card you have. If everything is OK, you should see a drop-down list of available refresh rates including \"Adapter default\" and \"Optimal\". </p> <p>Bear in mind that every graphics card has a finite amount of power and memory. You can only get the highest refresh rates by compromising on the screen resolution and the number of colours. So go back to the Settings page and either reduce the colour depth or screen area or both. Changing from, say, 32-bit True Colour at 1280 by 1024 pixels to 16-bit High Colour at 1024 by 768 pixels should automatically produce a higher refresh rate. </p> <p><strong> France calling </strong><br> I have two ageing PCs, one in the UK and one in France.

  "It was the rough equivalent of printing the obituary as soon as the patient was admitted to hospital. Scarcely had British Airways announced that it was grounding its Concorde fleet than the scribblers and assorted experts were predicting that the exotic bird would never fly again. It wasn't long before the \"I told you so\" brigade was in full song, pointing out that it had been a silly idea from the start - a commercial failure, a dubious display of propagandist technology and plain hubris. <p>The predictions of Concorde's demise had little to do with the specific nature of the technical flaws discovered by French crash investigators - after all, fixing a wheel can't be rocket science. Instead it had everything to do with the aircraft's apparently fatal loss of a crucial and often elusive commodity: public confidence. Put simply, however thoroughly Concorde is patched up, however many guarantees of its safety are issued, it seems unlikely that anyone will feel confident enough to fly in it. Or at least that enough people will to make it economically viable. </p> <p>But if history is any judge, reports of Concorde's death could be, to misquote Mark Twain, greatly exaggerated. Accidents and disasters happen. A bridge collapses, a fire breaks out in a tunnel, some foodstuff - eggs, beef - is found to make us ill, a new car with a high centre of gravity topples over at high speed, a medical drug causes an unforeseen outbreak of some nameless dread, and yet we go on to cross and recross bridges, drive through tunnels, boil eggs, roast beef, change lanes erratically on wind-lashed motorways at 100mph and swallow pills of uncertain provenance and dubious effect. </p> <p>It took three fatal crashes between May 1953 and April 1954 for BOAC to withdraw its depleted fleet of Comet airliners. The De Havilland Comet was the world's first jet airliner, a winged wonder to those who witnessed its first fare-paying flight on May 2 1952 from Heathrow to Johannesburg just as much as Concorde was when it took commercial wing some 24 years later. Unfortunately it also suffered metal fatigue: the fuselage expanded as the futuristic 500mph aircraft climbed into the stratosphere, cracks appeared and it fell apart. </p> <p>Yet four years later, the Comet 4, a similar aircraft, took to the air on the London to New York run. Passengers appeared to have had no fear of this stretched Comet, but what it had lost on the way to production was the confidence of airlines. Only 74 were sold worldwide: De Havilland had expected orders of up to 1,000. Just as well perhaps as, in all, 20 Comets crashed, killing nearly 500 people. The British jet was killed off in any case by the all-conquering Boeing 707, which set out from New York to London just a month after the Comet 4. Knowing the Comet's reputation, one of the first flights I paid for with my own money was on board a bucket-shop Dan Air Comet 4B at the tail end of its working life. We put accidents and disasters behind us, otherwise we would never fly, cross a bridge or dive into a tunnel. </p> <p>\"In terms of Concorde,\" says Dr Peter Marsh, psychologist and co-director of the Social Issues Research Centre, \"it comes down to the public's perception of risk. A plane crash is obviously seen as a disaster, but people are very aware that planes in general are a safe way of travelling [the risk of your plane crashing this year is approximately a million to one]. Even people who have a fear of flying are prepared to get on planes after crashes. The same applied to Concorde after the Paris crash. In fact, I think people will become very nostalgic if Concorde is grounded for ever; this is quite rational behaviour because people can work out the extent of their individual risk. Concorde is very unlikely to cause their death.\" </p> <p>The fire that broke out in 1996 has not discouraged millions of motorists, lorry drivers and Eurostar passengers (19 million last year) from travelling through the Channel tunnel; it is by far the most convenient link for most people between England and France. Passenger numbers were back up to pre-fire levels just a few weeks later. </p> <p>Similarly, many will remember the Herald of Free Enterprise, the roll-on, roll-off ferry that set sail from Zeebrugge in 1987, bow doors resolutely open. The car decks filled with water and it sank three quarters of a mile outside the harbour. Seven years later the bow doors were ripped off the Estonia as it sailed off the Finnish coast in a storm: 834 people died. It shouldn't have been on the high sea in a storm, just as there had been no excuse for the Herald of Free Enterprise to set sail with its bow doors open. Yet these incidents are rare and have not stopped many millions of people from sailing with their cars and loved ones across waters that can be every bit as treacherous. </p> <p>\"What these accidents do tend to encourage,\" says Neil Brown, of the Science Museum in London, \"is greater care and safety in the future. The reason the Forth Railway bridge was so hugely over-engineered was, in part, a response to the spectacular collapse of the Tay bridge a few years earlier. The Tay bridge was the longest in the world at the time of its construction in 1878; its loss [along with a locomotive, six carriages and 75 lives], was a blow to national prestige. This was the single greatest structural failure in these islands. It couldn't happen again.\" </p> <p>It didn't. Today's great bridges are nearly all held up by suspension cables. Forth, Severn and Humber road bridges all sway in the wind, yet we trust them not to give way to gravity as the Tacoma Narrows bridge, in Washington state, did in 1940. \"Gallopin' Gertie\", just 19 months old and so named because of her sick-making vertical oscillations, got herself into a mother of a twist that November. Twisting and shaking for 45 minutes, one sidewalk rose 28ft above the other before the cables snapped and Gertie gave up the ghost. A freak occurrence we say, and put it down to that. </p> <p>Entire technologies can be almost completely obliterated by major accidents - recall the fires that destroyed the R101 and Hindenburg airships in the 1930s - but in most cases, the spirit of opti mism triumphs over the dark angel of experience. In 1990 traces of benzene were found in Perrier at the height of the water's success in restaurants worldwide. One hundred and sixty million green bottles were recalled from the shelves of bistros, hotels and grocery stores. An investigation kept the sparkling water off the market for several months. This should have been time enough for Perrier's rivals, such as Evian and San Pellegrino, to sparkle. But no one had become ill and no one had died. \"Helleau,\" said the posters that June. The benzene incident has been forgotten. </p> <p>\"Perrier,\" says Peter Marsh, \"was a temporary accident. With effective PR it was easy to get public confidence back. But when people start believing that a certain food is truly toxic then you'll find an almost religious fervour against it. Evidence for the product will be misread. Unreason rules the roost.\" As, of course, it did in 1989 when a salmonella scare - real enough, but overegged - scrambled British brains. In our millions we took against the humble egg and with it Edwina Currie, a junior agriculture minister, who was duly sacrificed. A few years later came BSE and the unedifying sight of John Gummer, John Major's secretary of state for the environment, force-feeding his unfortunate daughter with a burger to prove to the press that she would not suffer from eating British beef. </p> <p>\"We've seen people becoming increasingly fearful of food because of BSE and GM scares\", says Marsh. \"Today there are influential organisations virtually dedicated to driving these fears.\" </p> <p>Much the same applies to the continuing debate over the mumps, measles and rubella (MMR) vaccine. This began in 1996 when an article in the British Medical Journal linked it to autism. It caused a national scare among parents that has yet to abate. \"The article was based on a study of just 25 children,\" a department of health spokesperson wearily points out. \"No causal link was established between autism and the vaccine. Every single bit of research that has been done on the topic since then has shown results to the contrary of the original study, but people still go on about it and parents are still worried.\" Our reaction to technologies that we believe to have failed or to be dangerous is undoubtedly confused. Concorde lets us down fatally for the first time in almost 25 years and it is promptly consigned to the scrapyard of history. And yet we may well rue its passing. Scares come and go. Has the Channel tunnel led to a plague of foreign rats and rabies in Little Britain? No. Has John Gummer's unfortunate daughter succumbed to BSE? No. Was anyone in a power suit poisoned by a bottle of Perrier? Again, no. </p> <p>Not long ago I got to drive a Chevrolet Corvair. (This was the car that made Ralph Nader's name as a champion of consumer rights in the 60s. Nader's book Unsafe at Any Speed did an effective j'accuse job on the rear-engined American sedan.) </p> <p>\"You're not going to drive one really, are you?\" asked an American friend. \"You're crazy. You'll kill yourself.\" I didn't because the car I drove was a '68 model; its rear suspension, the source of the car's troubles between 1960 and 1963, had been well and truly sorted out. The car drove safely, just as transatlantic liners sailed more safely after the sinking of the Titanic, as railway bridges were made safer after the Tay Bridge disaster, as suspension bridges were after the Tacoma Narrows incident. </p> <p>Sometimes our faith in progress is dented, but although you might not want to travel on one, airships are still blimping through the air 63 years on from the Hindenburg fire. And Concorde - the magnificent flying machine that fell to earth - might yet defy the obituarists.</p>",
  "A British rescue team equipped with a unique minisub is due to leave the Norwegian port of Trondheim today in what may be the last hope for Russian sailors trapped aboard the Kursk. <p>The minisub, the LR5 rescue vehicle, is not expected to arrive at the site of the accident in the Barents Sea until Saturday. It has never before been used in a real emergency. </p> <p>The LR5 can attach a \"mating wedge\" to the escape hatch of a submarine listing at an angle of 60 degrees, the bow-down position in which defence officials believe the Kursk has been resting over 100 metres down. </p> <p>A raging Arctic storm whipped up high waves all day yesterday, defeating repeated Russian navy attempts to get rescue capsules to dock with the huge stricken vessel. </p> <p>No signs of life were detected from the Kursk for the first time in five days, fuelling fears that it was too late for the British attempt to succeed where the Russians had failed. </p> <p>The deputy prime minister, Ilya Klebanov, said the fact that the crew had stopped making SOS signals by tapping on the hull of the submarine might not mean \"anything terrible\", but northern fleet officers in Murmansk said it could augur \"something sad\". </p> <p>The Russian navy chief has said repeatedly that oxygen supplies on the submarine will last only until tomorrow, while others fear that the oxygen might have run out already. </p> <p>Using two rescue capsules sent down from a surface ship, the Russians tried at least five times yesterday to lock on to the submarine's main escape hatch on the upper stern. But the stormy weather, the strong underwater currents, and the lack of visibility all frustrated attempts to lock on to the listing submarine. </p> <p>The Russian rescue craft, manned by crews of three, ran out of oxygen and one was damaged while surfacing. </p> <p>The chief designer of the rescue craft said the vessels had not been used for years and that few Russian sailors had any training in how to use them. </p> <p>The British LR5 also has a crew of three, and acts as an underwater lifeboat for up to 16 people at a time. A \"transfer skirt\" fixed to the escape hatch of the submarine equalises pressure by pumping out water, creating an airlock. The hatches of the submarine and the LR5 are then opened to enable the sailors to be transferred. </p> <p>The LR5 would then be steered to the surface, releasing the sailors, and return to collect others from the stricken submarine. </p> <p>The 34-strong rescue party includes navy divers, doctors, and interpreters. As well as the LR5, they will be equipped with a remote operated vehicle, the Scorpio, which will make an initial reconnaissance and clear any obstructions. </p> <p>The equipment was flown yesterday in a Russian Antonov to Trondheim from Prestwick airport near Glasgow. It is usually based at Faslane on the Clyde, Britain's nuclear submarine base, where it is kept by the owners, Global Marine, under an exclusive contract with the ministry of defence. </p> <p>It was being transferred last night onto the Normand Pioneer, a chartered vessel which will act as the mother ship for the operation. Decompression chambers were flown on ahead in RAF Hercules aircraft. </p> <p>Norway said yesterday it had agreed to a Russian request to send divers and possibly ships to help rescue the Kursk's crew. </p> <p>The Norwegian foreign ministry said a divers' mother ship now in the Haltenbanken area off north Norway was heading for the area of the Barents Sea above the crippled Kursk nuclear submarine. </p> <p>\"The vessel is starting to move north,\" foreign minister Thorbjoern Jagland said in a television interview. \"These are professional divers who can contribute in many ways. It is our understanding that they will help get the crew out.\" </p> <p>Foreign Ministry spokesman Kartsen Klepsvik said the vessel and divers, who had been working in Norway's offshore oil fields, could reach the downed submarine within two days. </p> <p>The LR5 has been used in five exercises but had never before been used \"in anger\", Roger Chapman of Rumic, the vessel's operating company, said yesterday. He added that the Russians had asked for help \"a bit late\". </p> <p>John Spellar, the armed forces minister, said British and Russian teams would work together \"because, as sailors, they will all understand the plight of their colleagues and fellow mariners on the seabed\". </p> <p>He added: \"We are delighted to be able to assist in trying to save sailors from an awful fate and one that is of concern to all right thinking people all around the world.\" </p> <p>An MoD spokeswoman said last night: \"We don't know how far into this the Russians are, what the state of the crew is or the vessel. There are so many things we don't know.\" </p> <p>She added: \"We see the media coverage of the sailors and the dire situation they're in. Nobody here would like to be in the position they're in. There's a lot of feeling for them in the mariner community.\" </p> <p><b>Useful links:</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.slingsby-engineering.co.uk/\" target=\"_NEW\">www.slingsby-engineering.co.uk/</a> Slingsby Engineering's LR5 submersible <br> <a href=\"http://www.janes.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.janes.com</a> Jane's information on submarines <br> <a href=\"http://www.bellona.org/imaker?sub=\" target=\"_NEW\">www.bellona.org/imaker?sub=</a> The Bellona Foundation: information on Russian sub risks</p>",
  "<p>Concerns about the amount of time workers in the United States spend surfing the net produced bumper sales yesterday for software snooper specialist SurfControl. </p> <p>The company, whose software monitors which websites employees are visiting and allows managers to restrict access, said the trend for staff to surf while they work had boosted its bottom line. </p> <p>According to Steve Purdham, chief executive of SurfControl, the company has been successful in America because of the growth of internet terminals in offices. </p> <p>He said that for a company with a thousand employees, each surfing the web for one hour a day, the cost is $35m (\u00a323m) a year. \"This is about 12.5% of the salary bill,\" Mr Purdham explains. \"[Our software] allows the company to set up rules [for internet use].\" </p> <p>Sales last year grew by more than 110% in the year to $14.3m. About 90% of revenue came last year from the US. </p> <p>The company, which is based in Cheshire, expects sales to rise as web use increases across Europe. Robert Barrow, the group executive officer, said: \"Our market is a burgeoning one in the US, with the UK catching up, and mainland Europe will come soon.\" </p> <p>Despite the optimism, the company reported a full year loss before tax of $24.9m against $2.1m last year. The loss includes write-offs from goodwill and provision for tax on share options. Deutsche Bank, the house broker, is predicting profitability in late 2002 or early 2003. </p> <p>Cash balances at the end of the period were $32m, while fourth-quarter revenues leapt 614% to $3.9m from $0.5m. </p> <p>The company said the cost of marketing and sales were the main drag on the post goodwill losses, but they were due to expenditure on infrastructure necessary for expansion. </p> <p>SurfControl now has seven worldwide offices - two in the US, two in Britain, and one in Rotterdam, Frankfurt and Vienna and does not expect marketing and sales costs to slow down next year. </p> <p>\"Its all about getting market presence,\" says Mr Purdham. \"SurfControl goes into markets that are ready for the product rather than educating the market.\" </p> <p>The company has also increased its staff by 285% and now has 293 employees. It plans to build on this growth through an \"aggressive\" acquisition strategy to build market share. </p> <p>SurfControl, formerly called JSB Software, recently acquired Austrian company CSM Security Management, provider of web content and email filtering software, and Cybercontrol from Mattel. The share price closed yesterday up 50p at \u00a320. </p> <p>\u0095 Shares in Patsystems, the software company that floated in March, tumbled despite a more than threefold rise in first-half sales as it reported wider losses. The shares were down more than 5% or 9p at 150p by the end of play yesterday. </p> <p>Losses increased to \u00a33.8m in the six months to June 30 from \u00a30.58m a year earlier, which the company said was due to investment targeted at accelerated software development, increased customer support, strengthened sales and marketing and wider global coverage. </p> <p>The company posted revenues of \u00a31.1m, up 304% percent. It said its number of clients had risen to 20 from six and billable end-users to 488 from 177 at the same point last year.</p>",
  "Everyone on earth should be allowed to vote in American elections. All the major decisions about the future of world are now brokered by the United States. Only the US has the power to provoke a world war. Only the US can re-engineer the global economy. <p>As the Transatlantic Economic Partnership - which is quietly \"harmonising\" our laws with those of North America - demonstrates, Washington now exercises more control over the lives of British people than Westminster. </p> <p>We will never, of course, be allowed to influence the world's most important political decisions. But this autumn we can do the next best thing, which is to plead with our friends and colleagues in the United States to cast their votes against Al Gore. The only hope for both America and us is that George Bush wins. </p> <p>A Bush presidency would, of course, be an unmitigated disaster. This poisonous political pygmy owes everything to the dollar and nothing to democracy. Under his governorship Texas has killed more convicts, left more children without health provision and poisoned more of its own air and water than any other state. Its spending on education, public hospitals and social services has all but collapsed. </p> <p>As president, Bush would cut the scant taxes rich Americans pay, disabling America's residual public provision. He would dump the minimum wage, abandon affirmative action, sell off national parks and destroy trades unions. </p> <p>He has suggested that he would like to see more adventures of the kind the US pursued in Nicaragua and Grenada, and fewer humanitarian missions. His incomprehension of world affairs will reinforce American isolationism, while his plans for a national missile defence system will launch a new nuclear arms race. </p> <p>Anyone with a grain of political sense, in other words, would be mad to support George Bush. But the biggest threat to Al Gore is a defection of Democratic voters not to the Republicans, but to the Greens, and their presidential candidate, Ralph Nader. Nader will capture, depending on which opinion poll you believe, anywhere between 3 and 10% of the vote. </p> <p>Crucially, his prospects are best in some of the states Gore must win to secure the presidency: Michigan, Ohio, Illinois, Oregon and California. There is, in other words, a seductive if superficial truth in the assertion, aired repeatedly by Democratic party hustlers, that \"a vote for Nader is a vote for Bush\". </p> <p>But Ralph Nader's campaign is about far more than the coming election. He has launched what amounts to nothing less than a rescue plan for American democracy, and with it, a rescue plan for the rest of the world. Nader, alone among the remaining candidates, has promised to tackle the world's principal problem, namely the corporate stranglehold on American politics. </p> <p>When George Bush raises $100m for his campaign, Al Gore has to do the same. In his eight years in office, Bill Clinton has distinguished himself by amassing some one billion political dollars, almost all of them, directly or indirectly, from corporations. </p> <p>This money is merely a measure of the politicians' indebtedness to special interests. The result is that the priority of both presidential candidates is to deliver not what the people want but what the corporations want. For the past 50 years, the world has been held to ransom by America's corporate oligarchs. </p> <p>Ralph Nader would kick corporate money out of politics, ensuring that public campaigns are publicly funded. He is, of course, no more likely to become American president in November than you are. </p> <p>The best he is likely to achieve is to hand victory to Bush, plunging the world into four terrifying years of government by morons. But the alternative is far worse. If Gore wins, backed by one hundred million corporate dollars, then the last faint hopes that a mainstream political party might fight for a change in the way American campaigns are financed will evaporate. </p> <p>His victory would hasten the arrival of a new and potentially endless dark age, in which only the demands of the mighty are acknowledged. </p> <p>If, by contrast, Gore loses because Nader steals his key votes, then this will force the Democratic party into the most profound self-examination in its recent history. As the Democrats come to see that they cannot recapture public trust until they have done something to earn it, they will ensure that campaign finance reform becomes the key issue in the 2004 presidential elections. </p> <p>If you don't stand up for what you believe to be right, regardless of the consequences, you will quickly discover that there is nothing left to believe in. The Americans, like all of us, should vote not in fear, but in hope. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:g.monbiot@zetnet.co.uk\">g.monbiot@zetnet.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Japanese investment bank Nomura yesterday refused to concede defeat in its four-month battle for control of Hyder, the Welsh utility group, despite a takeover panel ruling in favour of rival bidders Western Power Distribution. </p> <p>The panel yesterday rejected Nomura's appeal against the panel executive's decision to allow a 365p a share offer made by WPD in a sealed bid last Friday. The WPD offer topped Nomura's existing offer by 5p a share. </p> <p>A Nomura spokesman said the bank was still considering its options. Executives from its London-based principal finance group, which has led its bid for Hyder, spent the day closeted with their financial and legal advisers. </p> <p>The panel, which held a day-long meeting at its office in the London stock exchange building on Wednesday, said it would publish the reasons for its decision tomorrow. </p> <p>Hyder, which has been the subject of competing bids from Nomura and US-owned WPD, said it would respond to the panel's announcement \"in due course\". A spokesman said it was waiting for clarification from the panel. </p> <p>WPD said it was not prepared to comment, while Nomura's future intentions were still unclear. </p> <p>City sources said Nomura's first option would be to seek leave to appeal to the takeover panel's appeals committee, which is chaired by Sir Michael Kerr, a former lord justice of appeal. </p> <p>The committee is usually made up of its chairman or deputy chairman, and two other members of the panel who have not been previously involved in the issue at stake. </p> <p>Nomura is thought unlikely to consider seeking a judicial review of the panel's handling of the Hyder bids until it has explored all the panel's appeal procedures. </p> <p>There is an outside possibility that Nomura could still put its lower 360p offer to shareholders in the hope that it can persuade sufficient local shareholders that its plans will best solve Hyder's problems. Nomura already owns 16.2% of the group. Nomura has said it intends to retain Hyder's water and electricity operations and bring in new top management to run them. </p> <p>WPD abandoned an earlier plan to sell the assets of Hyder's regulated water business to a non-profit making trust after opposition from the water industry regulator. </p> <p>But it still intends to contract out the running of the business to United Utilities, the multi-utility group based in the north west of England. </p> <p>Both bidders have said that they do not intend to implement job cuts beyond the 1,000 already announced by Hyder's existing management. </p> <p>Hyder is heavily indebted and faces the loss of up to \u00a370m in profits this year as a result of regulatory price cuts. </p> <p>City bankers and investment managers, concerned about the takeover panel's handling of the Hyder bid, want to see the detailed reasoning behind yesterday's decision. </p> <p>The main points at issue will be the justification of the panel executive's decision to impose a sealed bid procedure in the first place and the reasons why it felt it could allow WPD's sealed bid, even though it was not announced by the executive's deadline of 4.30pm on Friday. </p> <p>WPD's delay in announcing its winning bid by Friday's deadline has been put down to a technicality which required its bid to be resubmitted. None of those involved has revealed what the technicality was. </p> <p>Welsh Assembly environment secretary Sue Essex said: \"I regret that if the takeover panel's decision stands this effectively means the break-up of the Hyder group and an end to one of Wales's most prestigious and well known companies.\"</p> <p> <strong> December 9 1999</strong> Hyder cuts interim dividend and announces strategic review </p> <p><strong> March 28 2000</strong> Sharp share price rise forces Hyder to admit bid is possible </p> <p><strong> April 14</strong> Hyder says it is discussing a bid </p> <p><strong> April 18</strong> Nomura makes agreed 260p a share bid </p> <p><strong> May 2</strong> Pennsylvania Power and Light and Southern Group plan counterbid through Western Power Distribution joint venture </p> <p><strong> May 2</strong> Barclays Capital backs out of WPD plan to create non-profit vehicle for Hyder's Welsh Water business </p> <p><strong> May 18</strong> WPD revises Welsh Water sell-off plan </p> <p><strong> May 31</strong> WPD makes 300p a share bid </p> <p><strong> August 1</strong> Hyder board backs Nomura's increased bid of 320p a share.

  "<p>Jodrell Bank is so big, it's unnerving. You may have seen the radio observatory's telescope in books, its upturned face cranking around to eavesdrop on some intergalactic cataclysm. But chance upon it as you steer between twisting hedgerows and you'll be hard pressed to keep an eye on the road. </p> <p>What is this vast latticed bowl slung between white-capped towers, cogged and pinioned and mounted on a circle of railway track the size of a stadium? Was it some alien mother ship that placed it on the Cheshire plain 50 years ago, laying it gently like an egg while cows and sheep munched and all the people slept? What is its purpose, and how much longer before that ship returns? </p> <p>\"When it moves at night,\" says Helen Knowles, \"it makes an incredible clanking weird sort of noise.\" </p> <p>Knowles has stood beneath the telescope at night, when all the visitors have gone, and only technicians and scientists remain to steer the gigantic dish and marvel over the radio signals that it hears in the depths of space. But Knowles is not a scientist. She is the observatory's artist in residence. Employed by the visitor centre, her job is to create works near the entrance to a 35-acre arboretum that was planted on land surrounding the observatory by its first director, the visionary Sir Bernard Lovell. </p> <p>Knowles plans to make an entire floor out of leather, and is currently tanning sheep hides in pits filled with water and oak bark. But she has temporarily set this aside in favour of an even more ambitious project - an exhibition entitled Radio Halo. </p> <p>\"Radio halo\" is the term astronomers apply to a phenomenon they have observed among the far-flung galaxies. And although Knowles is less than certain what it means, she knows it's a great name for her art show. \"We are making a halo of art around the observatory,\" she says. So 11 artists have busied themselves in the woods with string and spray-paint and magnetic stars. </p> <p>Magnetic stars? \"That's right,\" says Jay Townsend. \"I cut them all out by hand, and it really did my fingers in. The things we do for art.\" </p> <p>Jay has constructed what he calls a Big Bang Simulation Unit - a sort of celestial building site in the wet grass. \"People tend to forget it's really chaotic up there,\" he says, pointing at the rain clouds but seeing far beyond them. So his installation contains a\"roadworks\" sign and an old iron roller that attracts the multi-coloured magnetic stars. </p> <p>Close by, Leo Fitzmaurice has erected another road sign. With its white lettering on a coffee-brown background, it is a perfect simulation in wood and paint of the \"heritage\" signs that urge drivers to leave the dual carriageway and sample the delights of some nearby stately home. Except that Leo's sign bears the single word \"Heaven\". </p> <p>Similar \"Heaven\" signs crop up all over the woods, but each time in a different format. Beside the pond, black and yellow warns us of danger, while a large blue and white motorway sign shows us where to turn when the path forks. But Knowles has left the path and is tramping across the grass, to where Elizabeth Stuart Smith has been working in a clearing surrounded on three sides by water. </p> <p>\"It's a very, very nice place,\" says Liz. \"Sometimes there are cows and sometimes there are ducks. And there are five of these.\" She indicates a loose cylinder of transparent acetate, staked into the soil like a flimsy wastepaper basket and filled with empty acetate parcels. May one touch it? \"But of course.\" It's very strange. \"Well yes, it is.\" </p> <p>And she describes how she sought out an astronomer one day, and asked her what she did in her laboratory beneath the great radio dish. </p> <p>\"I thought it would be very straightforward - that they would pick up a radio signal and it would mean this or it would mean that. But instead she said, 'Well, we get it, and then we sort of decode it, then we have to iron it out, then we have to colour-code the images_' And I suddenly realised that astronomy, like art, is very uncertain. A lot of it's visible, but there's so much more that is hidden.\" </p> <p>Her work is called Invisible Light, which is a reference to the radio waves that the dish can hear but that the eye cannot see. \"It's about sunshine,\" says Liz. \"But it's about shadows, too.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile, Gillian Nicol has been catching shadows. Down on her knees, she has clipped a patch of grass into the image cast by a young ash tree in the morning. \"And that's the shadow at 5 pm,\" she says, pointing to another unexpected shape which, edged as it is with yellow string, suggests the chalk outlines that paperback detectives trace around murder victims. \"But this one was an hour later, and you can see it's already tall and slender.\" While Nicol uses trees as sun dials, Anna Hill uses them to describe an entire galaxy. With 30 saplings grown from a 2,000-year-old yew in Wiltshire, she is mapping out a great maze in the shape of the spiral nebula - a work that will take half a century to mature. </p> <p>As Helen Knowles skips through the embryonic maze to demonstrate its cunning double spiral, Ally Wallace explains why he chose to suspend a luminous green circle in some nearby foliage. \"I like putting alien things into an environment,\" he says. Why a circle? \"Because it seems to crop up a lot in astronomy.\" Why green? \"It's a jokey science fiction colour, and it ties in with the arboretum.\" </p> <p>Everywhere, artists are dreaming up such connections, and always with a method in their seeming madness. \"Art easily communicates an idea,\" says Knowles. \"Rachel Whiteread deals with negative space and Anish Kapoor with voids. These are very difficult scientific concepts, but through art they become tangible and visible and more easily understandable than looking at algebra.\" </p> <p>She points out four human figures, which on closer inspection prove to be empty life-size cloaks cast in plaster and resin. \"They represent the four moons of Jupiter,\" says Paula Chambers, and she explains how she modelled them so that their relative sizes match those of the heavenly bodies, as do their surface appearance (cratered Callisto, smooth icy Europa and so on). Even their characters reflect those of their mythological namesakes. </p> <p>Nearby, on washing lines strung from branch to branch, Julia Ingle has hung an extraordinary collection of garments - put there, she says, by child astronauts of the future who landed a few minutes ago and just had to rinse out their clothes. </p> <p>In a timber shelter among the trees, Andy Lawrence has cut two window holes and filled them with glass photographic transparencies that glow like cinema screens, while Benji de Burca has mounted stained glass panels in brightly painted traffic cones that mimic astronomical telescopes but work like giant kaleidoscopes. </p> <p>And all the while, as if slightly aloof from the proceedings, the great steel dish creaks and groans, seeing right through the clouds that occasionally dampen the artists' spirits and scanning the heavens for some glimpse of their meaning. </p> <p>\"For 15 years I've watched it from my studio window,\" says the artist and poet Noel Connor. Noel lives on a hill overlooking the observatory, and he sometimes imagines what that great ear would hear were it one day to turn away from the sky and listen instead to his ancient village. </p> <p>Among the trees of Bernard Lovell's arboretum, on plaques that are exact copies of the information boards dotted here, Noel has placed a series of short poems. \"Tonight, while we all sleep,\" reads one of his plaques, \"the fox will investigate art and the owl will hunt above both prey and poetry.\" </p> <p>Radio Halo is at the Jodrell Bank Arboretum, Lower Withington, Macclesfield, Cheshire (01477 571339), till September 7.</p>",
  "Hospital doctors set themselves on a collision course with the government yesterday when they rejected plans to ban them from working in the private sector for seven years after they finish their training. <p>Peter Hawker, chairman of the British Medical Association's consultants committee, said his colleagues regarded the proposal as \"irrelevant and insulting\", while two organisations representing trainee surgeons warned of a brain drain if ministers did not abandon the idea. </p> <p>The proposal to make consultants repay the NHS for the high cost of their training by forbidding them from private work for seven years came out of the blue as part of the government's national plan for the NHS. It was one of the few radical ideas, and was applauded by those who feel the NHS is not getting value for money from a small minority of consultants who spend most of their time in the lucrative private hospitals and consulting rooms. </p> <p>But consultants and junior doctors now in training to become consultants are furious, not least because the proposal has not been raised by ministers during the negotiations on a new NHS contract for consultants that have been going on for about a year. </p> <p>\"In the two weeks since the NHS plan was published we have had hundreds of angry telephone calls and emails from trainee surgeons,\" said David O'Regan, co-president of the Association of Surgeons in Training, which issued a joint statement with the British Orthopaedic Trainees Association. </p> <p>\"They find the government's attitude towards their professional commitment completely insulting,\" the statement said. \"They are actively discussing an alternative way of pursuing their careers, either by moving abroad or by setting up in consortia outside the NHS.\" </p> <p>The two organisations represent most of the 4,000 registrars in training to become consultant surgeons. </p> <p>They argue that by the time they have qualified they have spent 10 years working for the NHS, including many thousands of hours at night and weekends. </p> <p>\"They regard the idea that they must 'repay the state' by holding an exclusive contract with the NHS as insulting and contemptible,\" said the statement. </p> <p>With a swipe at the NHS, Mr O'Regan added: \"Many consultants feel that they can only practise to the very best of their ability in the private sector where they are not hampered by bureaucracy and poor funding. </p> <p>\"As consultants of the future we look forward to a working day that is not punctuated with apologies, excuses, delays, poor management and poor equipment. We are committed to providing an excellent surgical service and we expect the NHS to treat us fairly by providing a working environment that is clean, efficient, modern and dependable, with the time, facilities and money to enable us to use our skills appropriately.\" </p> <p>Dr Hawker of the BMA said the government seemed to have forgotten its commitment to joined-up thinking on public policy. \"It wants the private sector to work in harness with the NHS to reduce waiting lists. NHS trusts are themselves major providers of private care, and yet it seeks to tie new consultants to an exclusive contract with the NHS. </p> <p>\"Consultants regard this proposal as irrelevant and insulting. They work extremely long hours for the NHS and there is no evidence that the new generation of consultants currently in training will behave differently.\" </p> <p>The BMA is seeking a meeting with ministers on the issue which could be explosive and could wreck the negotiations that have taken place over changes to consultants' contracts.</p>",
  "In his defence of experimentation on human embryos, Ian Gibson (A Vote for Cloning, August 15) takes a long time to come to the nub of the matter: what exactly is the status of an embryo? Perhaps he would like to supply his versions of the following: a human embryo is not fully human because it lacks intelligence/is not complete or properly developed/is inferior in kind/etc. <p>Now if you replace human embryo with the word woman or disabled person, or black person or whoever else is considered only \"potentially\" fully human, maybe (from a historical perspective) you can understand the gigantic error.<br> <b>Dr Stefan Hawlin</b><br> Oxford</p> <p>\u0095 Patients and carers groups like Spring welcome the publication of the Donaldson report and the favourable response by the government to it. For incurable diseases like Parkinson's, the report opens up the possibility of novel treatments and a possible cure. Those who may oppose this development need to show good reason why people with chronic illnesses should be denied advances in medical treatments that would substantially improve their quality of life. Abstract arguments carry little weight with those whose daily lives are dominated by the struggle to cope with crippling conditions.<br> <b>Charles A Holme</b><br> Chairman, Spring </p> <p>\u0095 Action Research - one of the UK's leading medical research charities - welcomes the announcement of a free vote by MPs on the \"relaxing\" of the law regarding cloning for medical research. Whilst research using human embryos falls outside the charity's remit, we appreciate how important cloning of specific human cells is to the future of medical research.<br> <b>Duncan Barkes</b><br> Action Research<br> DBarkes@actionresearch.co.uk </p> <p>\u0095 Philosophically speaking, the human embryo can be characterised as a human being, albeit at a very early stage of development, since it requires nothing but the right environment to develop to adulthood. Contrary to Ian Gibson's claim, no such continuum extends to the sperm and unfertilised egg. </p> <p>It is easy to characterise one's opponents as reactionary, but the idea that human beings have intrinsic value is one of the foundations of our civilisation. Many movements in history sought to undermine this and have also claimed to act in the name of reason and progress.<br> <b>Dr Andrew Pinsent</b><br> Sunningdale, Berks<br> Itautec@compuserve.com</p> <p>\u0095 Regarding the Roslin Institute's decision to end pig transplant research, Dr Grahame Bulfield, its director, swiftly undermined the implications of Professor Wilmut's statement that \"it's possible there could be viruses we don't know about that could be released into the human population\" (Gene fears end pig testing, August 14). He claims that the programme may be ended for \"purely commercial\" reasons. True. The lawsuits which might arise should an Aids-like virus be passed from pigs to humans as a result of their research, or any medical procedure derived from it, could quite easily ruin the bio-tech industry. </p> <p>Two issues give rise to disquiet: that \"commercial\" reasons are the consideration, rather than the concerns of Professor Wilmut about medical risks; and Dr Bulfield's belief that \"other centres might be better equipped to pursue xenotransplantation research\". There is considerable disquiet about this genetic research in Britain - Dr Bulfield's remark suggests the research can be quickly transferred to \"other centres\" - perhaps in countries where public concern has little impact on the decision-making process.<br> <b>Nick Gunning</b><br> London</p>",
  "There is one common element in all the depressing reports we have carried this week on the state of world fishing. What they record is the direct and predicted consequence of rampant short-termism, of the failure of political institutions, and above all, of political will. Everyone has known for at least three decades that we could not go on plundering the seas to satisfy hungry markets without doing irreparable damage to future fishing. Yet that is what has been done. Desperate to meet insatiable demand from dwindling resources, big operators with mighty and avaricious boats have invaded the fishing grounds of people like those in Senegal, whose fate we described on Monday, threatening not just their livelihoods but their lives. <p>Solemn conferences have been held, and sound resolutions carried - but not then implemented. Britain, though not the worst offender, has failed to meet the target reductions it set itself. The European Union has failed most conspicuously, soliciting good expert advice and then not taking it, and allowing rates of erosion known to be unsustainable. </p> <p>One nation emerges with credit: Iceland, where in the aftermath of the cod war of the 70s, rigorous restrictions were imposed in the face of real difficulties and, after initial failure, enforced. Some draw the moral that responsibility for control should be taken back from the EU and vested in national governments. Others, like John Gummer, who ran both fisheries and the environment under the Tories, warn that national governments will always look after their own. But maybe those who work in the industry here are ahead of government. They recognise that overfishing for present profit implies future ruin. Some are leaving the industry; others are adjusting their practice to the bleak new realities. Unless political leaders make that adjustment too, the state of the oceans next time we come to assess it will be even more dire than it is today.</p>",
  "<p>Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere are at their highest for 20m years, two British scientists reveal today. </p> <p>The two men analysed the shells of tiny ocean creatures to build up a fossil record of the chemistry of the atmosphere for the past 60m years. Their discovery will add to pressure on governments to implement international agreements to reduce the greenhouse gases that fuel global warming. The news comes hard on a report from the University of Colorado that Arctic temperatures are at their warmest for at least 400 years. </p> <p>Paul Pearson of the University of Bristol and Martin Palmer of Imperial College, London, report in Nature today that they used the evidence of plankton shells drilled from the seabed to estimate the acidity of the sea water over a span of time back almost to the era of the dinosaurs. Carbon dioxide dissolves in water to form a weak carbonic acid. They reasoned that the tissue of floating organisms would reflect the carbon dioxide levels of the world around them - and then hold that record locked in the fossilised shells. </p> <p>Other studies of more recent records have confirmed a picture of a rapid warming in the past two decades. Winter is in retreat. The growing season in Europe is 11 days longer than it was 35 years ago. Sea levels have crept higher throughout the century. Six of the 10 warmest years ever recorded occurred in the 1990s; the other four all happened in the late 1980s. The Arctic ice cover is in retreat, shrinking by an area the size of the Netherlands every year. It is also thinning, from more than three metres thick to less than two metres in 30 years. </p> <p>Now a team from Boulder, Colorado, reports this week in the Dutch journal Climate Change that wherever it looked - at Arctic ice cores, lake sediments or plant growth in the permafrost - it saw confirmation that the Arctic had warmed by 6C in the past 30 years. </p> <p>But in the tropics, humans have felt the impact more cruelly. Researchers long ago predicted more storms, droughts and floods as a consequence of a warmer world, and both the economic costs, and the numbers of victims of climate-related disasters, have increased in the past decade. </p> <p>Paul Epstein, of the Harvard medical school in the US, warns in this month's Scientific American that global warming must also mean an increase in water-borne and insect-borne diseases to add to the threat. </p> <p>But until now researchers have had no clear idea of the long term pattern of the planet's atmosphere. Dr Pearson said: \"Our observations put the modern greenhouse effect into a long term perspective.\" </p> <p>For much of the past 20m years, the planet has been quite cool. An Australian team reports in Nature today that at the height of the last ice age, 21,000 years ago, sea levels were 135 metres lower than today, and the continents were covered by an extra 52m cubic kilometres of ice. </p> <p>But carbon dioxide levels are rising swiftly because of fossil fuel burning and the clearing of the planet's forests, which in past aeons have taken carbon from the air and stored it, first as wood and then as coal. By 2100 the carbon dioxide levels will increase to match those last seen in the Eocene, 50m years ago. In those days, much of Europe was flooded, there were no ice caps, London was a steaming mangrove swamp and the average temperature of southern England was 25C. Today, the average temperature is 10C. </p> <p>Professor Palmer said: \"This does not necessarily mean we will recreate Eocene-type conditions. There are still too many unknowns involved in climate prediction. But the sweltering ice- free world of the Eocene does warn us of what might happen if a runaway greenhouse effect sets in.\" </p> <p><strong>Useful links:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.doh.gov.uk/cegc/\">Union of Concerned Scientists</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.unfccc.de/\">UN Framework Convention on Climate Change</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/\">University of East Anglia's Climatic Research Unit</a></p>",
  "<p>Well, what went wrong? It is only 14 months since Britain's internet boom commenced, yet analysts are already chanting its obituary against the descant of high-flying startups hitting the decks. </p> <p>Companies such as <a href=\"http://www.Netimperative.com\" target=\"_new\"> Netimperative</a>, <a href=\"http://www.Boo.com/\" target=\"_new\">Boo.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.clickmango.com \" target=\"_newe\">Clickmango</a> ran into trouble despite having established quite well known brand names. For many years Britain's inability to nurture a strong venture capital industry was regarded as a serious structural weakness. Now it seems to have gone from boom to bust in a year. </p> <p>Or has it? The collapse of funding is really confined to the business-to-consumer (B2C) start-ups. A year ago venture capitalists were giving out-of-college entrepreneurs money even before they could get their backpacks off. Now, persuading a venture capitalist to fund a B2C proposition is like selling an ice cream in the Sahara. It melts into nothing while you are talking. </p> <p>But this doesn't mean that venture capital is dead. As Vic Morris of Atlas Venture points out, there is still plenty of venture capital around - but the smart money is now going into infrastructure, software and mobile telephony. VCs are still lending to retailing start-ups but just being much more choosy and concentrating on proven management skills rather than bright ideas. </p> <p>The surprising thing about the fall of the dot.coms is that anyone should be surprised. They are all small companies: and small companies have a very high mortality rate. Half of all new companies fail within five years, according to Dun &amp; Bradstreet. That's just the normal rate of creative destruction that makes capitalism tick. With dot.com companies you would expect the failure rate to be higher because of the youth and inexperience of the main players and the uncertainties of the new world of the internet. The difference is this - if they had been normal small companies, their successes would never have been exposed to the relentless daily spotlight of national publicity. </p> <p>Consider: Clickmango, with Joanna Lumley as its icon, had a turnover of only \u00a32,000 a week - which scales up to annual sales of \u00a3104,000. The local village shop could do better than that. </p> <p>At first \"Old Economy\" companies feared they might be swept away by the internet revolution they had been so slow to foresee. Then they realised they had two invaluable assets that the dot.coms had not thought much about. Brand identity and a proven delivery system. </p> <p>At this point the writing was on the wall for many of the less original start-ups that were merely selling old economy goods in an electronic way. They soon found out that the economic benefits arising from not having to build a national network of shops was offset by other factors. Like the vast amount of money needed first to make the public aware they existed and, second, to deliver the goods in a reliable way. </p> <p>It is salutary to see that <a href=\"http://www.Lastminute.com\" target=\"_new\">Lastminute.com</a>, the best known of all the UK start-ups which benefited from huge free publicity, spent almost \u00a36m on sales and marketing in the latest quarter. This was almost six times the value of its sales during the same period. This may turn out to be justified once the company has established a strong international presence - but it is not something that other less well endowed start-ups can easily replicate. Interestingly, Lastminute this week spent \u00a359m buying the French travel company D\u00e9griftour which pre-dates the world wide web. A rare case of a new economy company buying an old economy company to bolster its survival chances. </p> <p>So who gained from the frenetic first year of activity? The answer is everyone. It has been a traumatic wake-up call for commerce and industry. Companies know they must embrace the internet or be devoured by it. From the small corner shops now able to sell their specialist wares on a world market to the huge trillion dollar intranets being constructed by the world's biggest car companies to rationalise component purchases, the message is the same: the internet will transform the way we buy, sell and produce goods and services. </p> <p>The clear winner has been the consumer who has benefited from the deflationary impact of globalisation and the internet. This has brought remorseless downward pressure on prices because of the global availability of suppliers and the consumer's ability to surf the net for cheaper offerings of the same product. </p> <p>We have now entered the second stage of the internet revolution - a financial bloodbath which only the fittest will survive. The worst of the new start-ups will simply collapse and never be seen again. Some will struggle on without making any money while others will be snapped up at bargain basement prices by predators who will adapt the assets for new purposes. </p> <p>Hopefully, the second stage of the revolution, will also generate new business ideas based on the unlimited potential of the internet rather than merely gluing an internet selling solution to an Old Economy business. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the venture capital money is migrating to business-to-business ideas, to infrastructure building where less competition means there is more money to be made and to the huge, but as yet uncharted, possibilities of commerce through the ubiquitous mobile phone and interactive television. The revolution has barely begun.</p>"
