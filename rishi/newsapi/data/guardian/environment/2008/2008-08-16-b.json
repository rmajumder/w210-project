  "<h2>The Post-grad Gapper<br>'After my masters, time for something really different'</h2> <p><strong>Mushtaq Patas, student, 22, from Leicester</strong></p> <p><strong>The brief:</strong> 'I'm studying at Nottingham University for an MA which finishes in October, and after working for six months, I'm planning a six-month trip. I really want to go to South America, and am particularly interested in the Galapagos Islands. I would love to spend some time volunteering there. I'd also like to learn Spanish and travel around the region. But I would consider other destinations, such as India and Sri Lanka.'</p> <p><strong>Budget: </strong>At least \u00a34,000</p> <p><strong>The solution:</strong><br><strong> Lonely Planet's Abigail Hole: </strong>'There are lots of volunteer projects available on the Galapagos Islands. Mushtaq could try the Darwin Foundation (<a href=\"http://www.darwinfoundation.org\">darwinfoundation.org</a>), though it requires a minimum commitment of six months (volunteers pay their own transport, living expenses and insurance). Gap-year providers such as <a href=\"http://www.i-to-i.com\">i-to-i.com</a> or <a href=\"http://www.gapyearforgrownups.co.uk\">gapyearforgrownups.co.uk</a> offer places on various projects, i-to-i has one- to eight-week conservation projects (from \u00a3385 for the first week, \u00a385 a week thereafter, excluding flights). </p> <p>'He could start in Quito (return airfare \u00a3500-800) and sign up for a language course (doing so on arrival means he can compare schools before committing), often the school can sort out a homestay too. He can then head off to travel around South America. The Gap Year &amp; Round the World branch of Lonely Planet's Thorntree website (<a href=\"http://www.lonelyplanet.com/thorntree\">lonelyplanet.com/thorntree</a>) is a good source of ideas. </p> <p>'Or he could fly to Delhi from London, exploring India overland before flying from Chennai in the south to Sri Lanka. (Flying London-Delhi, then Chennai-Colombo-London will cost around \u00a3750; if he decides to visit only India, London-Delhi costs from \u00a3400 return.) The Confederation of Voluntary Associations (<a href=\"http://www.covanetwork.org\">covanetwork.org</a>) could match Mushtaq with a programme that requires his skills.' </p> <p><strong> Real Gap's Helen Guyver:</strong> 'Mushtaq could start by learning Spanish at our school in Quito (from \u00a3449 for two weeks, \u00a3999 for four), then choose between our Galapagos Giant Tortoise Volunteer Project (from \u00a3899 for two weeks or \u00a31,199 for up to four weeks - he can combine this with the language school and get a discount), or teach English to children in the Galapagos (from \u00a3849 for two weeks or \u00a31,099 for four weeks). On either project he would be working alongside international volunteers, many of whom would be travelling independently afterwards. Then he could head back to the Ecuador mainland and down through Peru and Bolivia. In Bolivia he could volunteer at the Sucre orphanage (\u00a3799 for two weeks' language school and four weeks' volunteering).' </p> <p><strong> Year Out Group's Richard Oliver:</strong> 'India is a very popular destination for volunteers, Sri Lanka less so, not least because of the security situation. The key to a successful placement is research. Year Out Group's website lists a huge range of volunteering organisations, and has a planning checklist. Mushtaq should also ask to be put in touch with someone who has recently returned from that placement. </p> <p>'Changing Worlds offers childcare, medical, journalism and teaching placements in India from \u00a32,665 for three months, including flights, a two-day course in the UK, three-day familiarisation on arrival and basic food and accommodation. Projects Abroad offers placements in India and Sri Lanka in teaching, care, conservation, journalism, business and veterinary medicine starting at \u00a3845 for a month and \u00a31,395 for three months (slightly more for Sri Lanka). The price includes food and accommodation, transport to and from the airport and insurance. Placements can be extended for \u00a3395/\u00a3495 a month.'</p> <h2>The Big Spenders<br>'Six months to see the world'</h2> <p><strong>Jackie, 60, speech and language therapist, and Warwick Turnball, 61, university social work tutor, from Leeds</strong></p> <p><strong>The brief: </strong>'We're planning a six-month trip from around November 2009. We're both in good health and young in attitude. We'd like to include south-east Asia. New Zealand is also a must, probably touring in a camper van. We would like to include South America, particularly Machu Picchu in Peru and the Galapagos Islands. But we're open to suggestions.'</p> <p><strong>Budget: </strong>\u00a330,000</p> <p><strong>The solution: </strong><br><strong>Lonely Planet's Abigail Hole: </strong>'The first step would be to pick up a round-the-world ticket - try Western Air (<a href=\"http://www.westernair.co.uk\">westernair.co.uk</a>), Round the World Tickets (<a href=\"http://www.roundtheworldtickets.com\">roundtheworldtickets.com</a>) or Round the World Experts (www.roundtheworldexperts.co.uk). A route might be Manchester-Bangkok-Singapore-Sydney-Auckland-Santiago-Lima-Quito-Manchester (around \u00a32,250). They could do the Bangkok-Singapore section overland or arrange a tour from Bangkok to Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia, with Explore (<a href=\"http://www.explore.co.uk\">explore.co.uk</a>). Then they could fly to Singapore, and train, bus or boat it to Malaysia (try the Perentian Islands). After touring in New Zealand, they can fly to Santiago in Chile, then fly or travel overland to Lima and Machu Picchu, then Ecuador for a cruise around the Galapagos Islands (try <a href=\"http://www.happygringo.com\">happygringo.com</a>).'</p> <p><strong>Real Holiday's Philip Davies: </strong>'The oneworld airline alliance, which includes BA and nine other carriers, offeres a 'Global Explorer' multi-stop ticket at just over \u00a32,000, allowing up to 10 stopovers. I would suggest they start in South America, hitting New Zealand for Christmas and south-east Asia in the spring when the weather's perfect. They could start in Quito, Ecuador, with Imaginative Traveller's (<a href=\"http://www.imaginative-traveller.com\">imaginative-traveller.com</a>) 23-day 'Galapagos and Inca Explorer' trip (it includes Machu Picchu). We could tailor a 14-day trip in Chile taking in the Atacama Desert, the lakes and Santiago. Next they could fly to Auckland, stopping off on Easter Island and Bora Bora in French Polynesia. In New Zealand we could tailor-make a trip, but a camper van gives flexibility. They could drop the van in Christchurch and fly to Thailand via Sydney. That would leave \u00a39,000 for an independent adventure around Indochina.'</p> <p><strong>Trailfinders' Andrew Appleby: </strong>'To make the most of each region, they should book open-jaw flights and travel overland between the main cities. We'd recommend flying into Bangkok, out of Singapore, into Auckland, out of Christchurch and into Santiago and out of Lima. A British Airways &amp; Qantas World Discovery ticket for the basic route costs from \u00a31,549; we can add other flights. Trailfinders offers a range of tours such as a seven-day independent Peruvian tour with GAP Adventures covering Cuzco, the Sacred Valley and Machu Picchu, from \u00a3755 per person. Or we can tailor-make an itinerary - with their budget, the sky is the limit. If they tour New Zealand in a camper van, they should be sure to take in the dramatic scenery around Queenstown and Lake Wakatipu on South Island. Vans cost from \u00a340 a day.'</p> <h2>A Solo Trip<br>'Getting under the skin of a place'</h2> <p><strong>Susan Thompson, 59, NHS business manager, from Chester</strong></p> <p><strong>The brief: </strong> 'I'm looking to set myself a new challenge. I'm planning a solo trip next year of between three and six months and am flexible about where to go, although my first call will be Japan as I have family there. I'd prefer to travel slowly in a couple of countries and really get to know them and the culture. I want to do some voluntary work and I'd like the money I spend to benefit local people.'</p> <p><strong>Budget: </strong>\u00a36,000</p> <p><strong>The solution: </strong><br><strong> Lonely Planet's Abigail Hole: </strong>'Susan should buy a flight to Japan via Bangkok (\u00a3800). On the return leg, she can explore south-east Asia, perhaps heading for Malaysia or Vietnam to volunteer, as these are particularly unthreatening countries. A good place to start research into voluntary work is <a href=\"http://www.lonelyplanet.com/volunteer\">lonelyplanet.com/volunteer</a>, which advises on how to best benefit local people. I-to-i (<a href=\"http://www.i-to-i.com\">i-to-i.com</a>) offers possibilities such as building homes in Vietnam (\u00a3595-1,595/two-12 weeks). For other building projects try Habitat for Humanity (<a href=\"http://www.habitatforhumanity.org.uk\">habitatforhumanity.org.uk</a>), which runs building projects (\u00a31,876/two weeks in Cambodia). Or in Pokhara, Nepal, she could help at the Rainbow Orphanage (<a href=\"http://www.orphancarenepal.org/volunteer.php\">orphancarenepal.org/volunteer.php</a> - \u00a3350/two months). </p> <p><strong> Real Holidays' Philip Davies: </strong>'Susan could book a return flight with Sri Lankan Airlines from London to Tokyo via Colombo. If she departs in late September and stays for a month she will enjoy the autumn colours, and have time to see her family and travel. She can then use the Tokyo-Colombo leg of her ticket to connect to Cochin in southern India and join a 29-day North and South India Trip with Intrepid Travel (<a href=\"http://www.intrepidtravel.com\">intrepidtravel.com</a>). Susan could jump ship at the end of the southern section at Masinagudi, close to the Jungle Retreat in the Nigiri Hills for wildlife experiences - where dormitory accommodation costs less than \u00a310 a day. Then she could fly from Bangalore to Delhi to pick up the northern half of Intrepid's trip, with its Moghul and Rajput highlights. It ends in Delhi so she could fly south to Colombo in January and start six weeks of volunteer work organised by i-to-i (details as before). With international flights at \u00a3810, internal flights at \u00a3400, Intrepid's tour at \u00a3890, a week at the Jungle Retreat from \u00a350 and a six-week children's home volunteering placement coming in at \u00a3695, Susan will still have half her budget left for travelling in Japan.'</p> <p><strong> Gap Year for Grown Ups' Helen Guyver:</strong> 'She could fly from London to Tokyo, then to Auckland, on to Adelaide, overland to Perth, then back via Bangkok and Delhi for around \u00a32,200. After two weeks in Japan she could join our 'Grand Island Explorer', a 21-day adventure tour of New Zealand which costs \u00a31,499, followed by the 'Ultimate Road Journey' in Australia, taking nine days to explore the southern coast, with bush walking, swimming with dolphins and camel trekking. She could then spend four weeks doing community development work in Thailand, teaching English, with a week on a beach too, for \u00a3999, and possibly finish off with four weeks' volunteering in India at the Kanjar Community Development in Rajasthan for \u00a3649. If this is too much she could just choose parts of it and stay longer.'</p> <h2>The Green Travellers<br>'We don't want to fly'</h2> <p><strong>Lise Hovesen, 22, and Temujin Doran, 24, art students, from Falmouth, Cornwall </strong></p> <p><strong>The Brief: </strong><br>'We're planning a round-the-world trip by land and sea \u2013 we don't want to fly \u2013 starting in October . We need to start in Berlin and would then like to travel<br>to St Petersburg and on to Moscow for the Trans-Mongolian train to Beijing. We'd like to spend some time in China and about a month in Asia, possibly getting a ferry to Japan. We have heard that some people will take you on as crew on boats \u2013 is this 'sea hitch-hiking' viable? We like the idea of a cargo ship across the Pacific from Hong Kong to Canada and would like to spend<br>time in Canada and America, possibly looking for work to top up our budget. '</p> <p><strong>Budget:</strong> \u00a36,000-plus between us</p> <p><strong>The solution: </strong><br><strong>Ed Gillespie: </strong>'For the Trans-Siberian and Mongolian railways they need to book well in advance through a Russian agent (G&amp;R International via <a href=\"http://www.hostels.ru/en\">hostels.ru/en</a>); both get very busy. Ferries to Japan from China go from Tianjin or Shanghai to Kobe and Osaka, take around 48 hours and are good value (try shanghai-ferry. co.jp ). They can get a cargo ship from Japan to Canada (<a href=\"http://www.freightertravel.co.nz\">freightertravel.co.nz</a>) but freighters cost \u00a360-80 a day. For security reasons cargo ship \"hitchhiking\" is not possible these days, but they may<br>be able to ride free on a yacht (<a href=\"http://www.crewseekers.net\">crewseekers.net</a>) . They should not tie<br>themselves to an itinerary - half the fun lies in plans changing!'</p> <p><strong>Lonely Planet's Abigail Hole:</strong> 'They could look for work teaching English in China or Hong Kong (<a href=\"http://www.overseasjobcentre.co.uk\">overseasjobcentre.co.uk</a>). Some freighter ships accept paying passengers (http://studenttravel.about.com/od/boardaboat/a/boattravel.htm) but they're no bargain when a Tokyo-California voyage lasts 13 days. Work permits for Canada or America are tricky; they could try Australia instead, applying for a<br>working holiday visa (<a href=\"http://www.immi.gov.au/visitors/working-holiday\">immi.gov.au/visitors/working-holiday</a>) before they go.'</p> <p><strong>Rough Guide's Doug Lansky:</strong> 'After the trans-Mongolian to Beijing, they should head to Shanghai or Hong Kong to catch a freighter to Australia (<a href=\"http://www.strandtravel.co.uk\">strandtravel.co.uk</a>, <a href=\"http://www.freighterworld.com\">freighterworld.com</a>, <a href=\"http://www.freighter-cruises.com\">freighter-cruises.com</a>), or continue to Singapore and pick up a boat there. From Adelaide they can take a container ship to Auckland (six days) and try to hitch a ride on a yacht to Tonga, Fiji, Hawaii or the US from Auckland, Opua or Whangarei. Or they could stay in Australia and look for a ride from Townsville, Airlie Beach or the Whitsundays. In the US, take Greyhound buses (<a href=\"http://www.greyhound.com\">greyhound.com</a>), Amtrak trains (<a href=\"http://www.amtrak.com\">amtrak.com</a>) or do a driveaway (driving someone else's car ) to cross the country.

I am hoping to climb three of the Seven Summits (the highest mountains on each of the seven continents) \u2013 Mount<br>Elbrus in Europe (5,642m) , Kilimanjaro in Africa (5,895m ) and Aconcagua in South America (6,962m ). I have some climbing/mountaineering experience, but training is something to consider. I'll be travelling alone, but will most likely join a guided group.'</p> <p><strong>Budget: </strong>Around \u00a35,000 (excluding equipment)</p> <p><strong>The solution: </strong><br><strong>KE Adventure Travel's Pete Royall:</strong> 'None of these three summits is technically difficult but all require good fitness and stamina, mainly to deal with the effects of high altitude. Of the three, Elbrus is the only one where Sam will definitely need crampons, ice axe and basic mountaineering skills. He could perhaps enrol on a winter skills course before attempting this peak. The budget is not really enough for all three peaks as they are on different continents; I would suggest he concentrate on the highest two and enjoy travelling in Africa and South America . He will have the best chance of success if he joins an organised expedition. This will ensure a good acclimatisation programme and he'll share the adventure with like-minded people. KE Adventure Travel offers a nine-day ascent of Kilimanjaro for \u00a3795 excluding flights, and park fees will add another \u00a3370. KE's 22-day Aconcagua ascent costs \u00a31,995 excluding flights, and climbing permits are \u00a3165 in December or January, or \u00a3115 in February. With careful selection of routes and airlines Sam should be able to keep total flight costs under \u00a31,500. The best season to climb Aconcagua is December to February. Kilimanjaro can be climbed pretty much all year round, though it would be sensible to avoid the two wet periods of April/May and November.'</p> <p><strong>Climber magazine's Kate Burke:</strong> 'The obvious route for Sam is to join a guided group. Companies such as Jagged Globe run trips to the Seven Summits, providing not only a guide, but also porters, food, permits and even equipment . The full cost of a trip to one of these peaks with a UK organisation could be in the region of \u00a32,000 . See <a href=\"http://www.climber.co.uk/marketplace\">climber.co.uk/marketplace</a> for a list of companies offering expeditions. Finding a guide or group in the nearest town (eg. Moshi for Kilimanjaro) may be cheaper, but he won't know the credentials of the guide. Kilimanjaro does not require technical ability, but a high level of fitness is essential. Aconcagua is much more challenging: as well as fitness and mental strength, experience with crampon and ice axe is useful, as is experience of moving together roped up. It may be worth going on a winter mountain skills course beforehand. Plas y Brenin in Snowdonia and Glenmore Lodge near Aviemore offer a range of courses. Sam may struggle to find an expedition to Elbrus, as the Foreign Office currently advises against travel to this area [the Caucasus], due to political problems.</p>",
  "<p>How's this for contrariness? A Nationalist government rules in Edinburgh; a National Theatre of Scotland production sells out to rave reviews in London en route to New York; an exhibition on Impressionism and Scotland wows the crowds at the Edinburgh Festival; and what happens? The Scottish media crashes further into crisis.</p> <p>Every week seems to bring announcements of turmoil or retreat: budget cuts and job losses at the Scotsman in Edinburgh and the Herald in Glasgow; plunging circulations at both - down by 9.6 and 7.6 per cent year on year respectively; news of a ballot for industrial action at the Daily Record; the share price of SMG, which owns Scottish TV, languishing at less than 10p. How are the mighty fallen.</p> <p> So what, you might ask? Isn't media-land cluttered with horror stories on both sides of the Atlantic in the wreckage of the credit crunch and the proliferating internet? It is, but there's an alarming trend in Scotland which has defied all expectations.</p> <p> Its national media is weakening relative to its UK competitors at a time when Scottish politics has seldom been more interesting and Scots seldom more influential (Prime Minister, Chancellor etc). Just when you'd expect Scots to be turning more and more to home-grown publications to feed their hunger for Scotland, they're not. The reasons are not hard to come by. It's those old marketplace stalwarts: value for money and quality.</p> <p>Which papers are the best for Scottish sport? I know people who'd argue the Daily Mail, the Sun and the Sunday Times. Which daily paper covers Scottish politics with most authority? Some would say the Times. Which newspaper does Scottish human interest stories the best? Probably the Daily Mail.</p> <p>As UK nationals have become markedly stronger in Scotland so the Scottish-based papers have become weaker at almost everything else: foreign news and analysis, UK and global financial news and comment, the English Premier League. Budget cuts have forced them to reduce their geographical reach.</p> <p>They are relatively small-scale operations in one of the world's most crowded and competitive media battlegrounds (15 morning newspapers). Their marketplace is five million people, compared to 55 million for the UK nationals. Their revenue is over-reliant on declining property and recruitment advertising. Their profit margins, particularly in the case of the Herald and the Scotsman, are higher than their UK competitors. Something has to give. And it has: the quality and range of editorial content.</p> <p>When I was editor of the Herald (2000-05), I tried unsuccessfully to resist budget cuts by arguing that, if we were making baked beans, would we expect to maintain sales and market share if we decreased the number in a can but raised the price in line with our competitors? The answer, of course, is no, though that has seldom deterred the Herald's owners, Newsquest, from doing just that.</p> <p>Every Scottish media company is suffering a damaging loss of influence and reach. The Sun overtook the Daily Record in 2006, something unthinkable to most media commentators when it launched its Scottish edition two decades ago. The Scottish edition of the Daily Mail sells more than the Scotsman and the Herald combined. The Scottish edition of the Sunday Times has regained its position as the quality Sunday market leader, ahead of Scotland on Sunday and the Sunday Herald</p> <p>If the Times flexed its commercial muscle with Sun-style price-cutting and editorial investment, who doubts it could overtake the Scotsman to become the leading premium media brand in prosperous Edinburgh and the south-east of Scotland? The gap between the two newspapers is now only 21,000 copies.</p> <p> The final ignominy is that Scotland doesn't seem to care about the plight of its newspapers. What ingratitude. After all, didn't they keep the devolution flame burning during the dark days of Margaret Thatcher? The sobering truth is that the country's indigenous media deals predominantly in one commodity - Scotland - and it has lost value as more UK newspapers trade in it, while the internet's pull of advertising and readership away from newspaper property and recruitment sections is particularly damaging.</p> <p>Another assumption has bitten the dust: that a weakening media sector would damage Scotland culturally. Participation in the arts is growing, Scottish writing is thriving, teenage boys and girls think piping is cool. Contrary indeed. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Mark Douglas-Home is former editor of the Herald and Sunday Times Scotland</p>",
  "<p>Raschid Gibrail is your typical tea trader and entrepreneur: his family history is almost impossibly exotic. His company history neatly encapsulates the rise and fall of the tea industry and, in recent years, the cultural and financial revival of the most English drink of them all.</p> <p>Gibrail's Somali father Ismail arrived in London in 1920, demobbed from the Royal Navy after serving alongside Lawrence of Arabia in the First World War. He opened his caf\u00e9 in Blackpool and by 1938 his company, Ismail &amp; Co, was blending and brewing coffee and tea for the Duke of Westminster. Raschid took over in the 1960s, but by 1991 Britain was in love with coffee. Tea was out, and Ismail &amp; Co closed its doors. </p> <p>Yet in recent years, something odd has happened to the British cuppa. While sales in 'black' tea, the sort you find in your standard supermarket-brand bag, have been falling for years, sales of herbal, fruit and, most notably, green teas - the latter packed with antioxidants and good for the immune system - are booming. In July 2007, Euromonitor tipped UK green tea sales to jump 61 per cent in the five years to 2011, to \u00a324.3m, even as black tea sales declined nearly 8 per cent to less than \u00a3600m. </p> <p>The chief beneficiaries have been fast-growing tea traders and blenders - companies such as London-based Newby Teas, Jing Tea and Postcard Teas. They tend to be run by entrepreneurs who wouldn't be out of place on the clipper ships and trading routes of the 19th century. 'This new industry is being created by people with a real passion for tea, who have given up working as a teacher or a civil servant,' says Jane Pettigrew, a leading authority and writer on the subject. </p> <p>Fast-growing companies with chunky margins inevitably attract the attention of larger rivals, and niche British tea makers are increasingly being targeted by acquisition-hungry foreign companies, many from the Indian subcontinent. </p> <p>This is not new, but the process is speeding up. India's mighty Tata Group started it, buying up Tetley in 2000 for \u00a3271m. Three years ago, Apeejay Surrendra group, also from India, bought Typhoo for \u00a380m. Earlier this year Tata was at it again, bidding \u00a330m for Clipper, a speciality producer of fairtrade and organic teas and coffees based in Dorset. Tata failed and Clipper, founded in 1984 by husband-and-wife team Michael and Lorraine Brehme, was sold to the financial firm Fleming Family and Partners.</p> <p>Tata was not the only Indian firm to throw its hat into the ring. Mumbai-based Sapat International lodged a \u00a324m bid for Clipper, which also fell short of the mark. But Sapat's owner, Nikhil Joshi, has not given up. He has a kitty of \u00a320m to spend on a British tea brand and told The Observer he has two companies in his sights: Whittard of Chelsea and Taylors of Harrogate. </p> <p>What makes Sapat, founded 110 years ago by Nikhil's grandfather, RH Joshi, and with an annual turnover of over \u00a3100m, so desperate to make it in Britain? The answer is in the brand. Being seen as 'British', or, more specifically, 'English' in the tea business is, if not a passport to success, then certainly an open ticket. Sapat may be one of the biggest growers, blenders and shippers in a country that exported 188,000 tonnes of tea in 2005, but its brand value overseas is nil. </p> <p>'If the product says 'Made in India', it won't make the right impression on the customer,' says Joshi. 'If you go to the Russian market, for instance, a British label has more appeal. An English brand like Ahmad Tea or Newby Teas may grow their leaves in India, but they are packaged and sold to the Russians as an English brand.' Hence the scramble to buy up a British tea brand before Tata and Unilever gobble them all up.</p> <p>Joshi may have to look farther than Newby or Ahmad, both of which profess their determination to remain independent. And while both are London-based firms, each is run by merchants with roots in Persia and India. Ahmad's name and brand was brought to London in the 1980s by three Iranian brothers, who re-exported the new, 'British' product back to Tehran. Newby was founded in 2000 by a British Indian merchant, NK Sethia, who started his career - like Raschid Ismail - as a London tea taster and broker in the swinging Sixties. </p> <p>Both companies have moved aggressively into the Russian market, which has fast become one of the biggest global buyers of high-quality leaf. According to the International Tea Committee, Russian imports of tea jumped from 111 million tonnes in 1996 to 170 million by 2005, with annual imports to the former Soviet bloc notably Belarus, Ukraine and the Baltic states, up more than 25 per cent over the period, to 64 million tonnes.</p> <p>Both Newby and Ahmad make much of their adopted Englishness. Ahmad festoons its products with paintings heavy in English antiquity. 'We portray ourselves as a very English brand,' says Ahmad's export manager, Justin Tate. 'We sell the romantic view of 'Britishness' to foreigners - Buckingham Palace, royalty, and so on.'</p> <p>Other companies go further, even when they are about as British as Stalin. Orimi Trade, based in St Petersburg in Russia, has adopted an English name - and website: Greenfieldtea.co.uk - to appear more Blighty and less Boris. </p> <p>While some traders export a nostalgic vision of the Empire, others prefer to tempt Brits with high-end teas grown in the fields of the Far East. Take Postcard Teas, based on London's New Bond Street, a three-year-old company whose sales are doubling each year. Its founder, Timothy d'Offay, spent nearly a decade exploring east Asia's best tea plantations. </p> <p>His epiphany was that the finest teas from Korea, China, Japan and Taiwan could be enjoyed by British customers more used to a Tetley drawstring bag. He says the range of customers in his shop has caught him by surprise. 'There is a new batch of connoisseurs out there, particularly young men, who may not buy expensive wines, but who find a link with a terroir [the French designation for the characteristics of soil and climate that provide a wine with a specific taste or personality].'</p> <p>Without the recent change in our drinking habits, many of these vibrant young trading firms would not exist. There would be no place in the Kentish town of Tunbridge Wells for Raschid Gibrail's new firm, Ismail Coffee and Tea. Reopened in 2007, it has proved a hit, and Gibrail's investors envisage opening up to 25 more Ismail-branded outlets around the country. The customers love it, says Gibrail: 'Tea is like wine 10 or 20 years ago - people were drinking it, but they didn't know what they were drinking. That has changed for the better, and the same thing is happening in the tea industry.'</p> <h2>Sales forecasts</h2> <p><strong>Black tea</strong></p> <p><strong>2006 </strong>\u00a3644m</p> <p><strong>2011 </strong>\u00a3595m </p> <p><strong>Down 8%</strong></p> <p><strong>Green tea</strong></p> <p><strong>2006 </strong>\u00a315.1m</p> <p><strong>2011 </strong> \u00a324.3m </p> <p><strong>Up 61%</strong></p> <p><strong>Fruit/herbal tea</strong></p> <p><strong>2006 </strong>\u00a367.2m </p> <p><strong>2011 </strong>\u00a388.1m </p> <p><strong>Up 31%</strong></p> <p><strong>'Other' tea</strong></p> <p><strong>2006 </strong>\u00a36m </p> <p><strong>2011 </strong>\u00a315m </p> <p><strong>Up 150%</strong></p> <p><strong>Source:</strong> Euromonitor International</p>",
  "<p>Where were the leaders when the lights went out? Every crisis in the global or national economy is a test of leadership - and a condemnation of preceding failure. Today's disasters were set in train by people, then foolishly regarded as heroic leaders, whose insane and inane errors led their followers into the abyss. </p> <p>Yet this debacle occurred after a long, soaring boom in which business leaders and leadership were celebrated (and remunerated) as never before. Any issue of the Harvard Business Review, for example, was liable to contain an inspiring piece on leadership. Indeed, an entire HBR 'article collection' is devoted to 'Leadership Fundamentals' and how to 'chart your course to Great Leadership'.</p> <p>'Great Managership' somehow doesn't have the same ring. By its nature, leadership is where the action is. Managers and management have been side-tracked in an era that celebrates inventions like leadership's 'online labs' and 'the uncompromising leader'. For $10,000 you can hear Jack Welch, erstwhile CEO of General Electric, at a two-day Boston jamboree. On the menu is, naturally, 'The key characteristics of effective leaders and how to put them into action'. Welch came to power and glory through one of leadership's most striking demonstrations: the turnaround he staged in the then most highly valued corporation in the world. He started a 20-year reign by assuring everyone that his predecessor's well-regarded reign was actually a slow-moving journey to disaster. This analysis became a manifesto for wholesale change, which in turn won him the nickname 'Neutron Jack' for eliminating large numbers of staff while leaving the buildings intact, in the manner of the bomb of the same name.</p> <p>De-staffing, even on this scale, was no Welch innovation. In fact, as the easy part of crisis management, cutting jobs is a standard programme, like getting better control of the cash. That element of establishing better order and discipline - ie, sound management - is basic to the rearguard actions that the majority of Britain's business leaders are fighting today. When orders shrink, costs soar and prices fall, you can't afford sloppiness.</p> <p>Could you ever? It shouldn't take possibly the worst business disaster since the Great Crash of 1929 to emphasise the vital importance of good housekeeping. That's what managers are supposed to supply and good leaders demand. </p> <p>But leadership is meant to provide much more than a healthy cash flow and ever-rising investment returns. It is the spark that ignites new ventures, spurs innovation, tries out novel ideas, invents and/or penetrates new markets. </p> <p>A true leader isn't just somebody who doesn't make mistakes, or someone whose successes outweigh their flops. The right people generate and regenerate organisations by the quality of their thought, the speed and effectiveness of their change management and their desire for victory in competitive markets. In or out of crisis, the anxiety (all too often justified) is that sitting managements, conditioned by rigid environments, miss out on the magic. In crisis, however, that loss is intensified by the urgent need to save the endangered ship. </p> <p>In fact, all types of investment - in people, projects and processes - are needed in good times and bad. Indeed, bad times are in some ways the ideal environment for the innovative, path-finding leadership that creates new opportunities. Ask Steve Jobs of Apple or Jeff Bezos of Amazon, who told Business Week: 'My view is that there's no bad time to innovate.'</p> <p>At Apple, when the IT bubble burst, Jobs made a conscious decision to raise investment, moving into the gaps created by the cutbacks obligingly carried out by his rivals. Bezos states baldly that Amazon had no option but to carry on innovating. 'For us, it's such a deep-seated model, I'm not sure we have a choice.' In other words, you won't achieve anything by abandoning the building blocks of achievement.</p> <p>It's not only a question of waiting for the good times to roll. That's leaving it too late. At Intel, previous CEO Andy Grove observed that most companies don't renovate their leading products until the returns have already shrivelled and new competition is baying at the door. In his opinion, even heavyweights never recover from passing what he called the 'strategic inflexion' point.</p> <p>Time is a crucial factor, and the critical time for a firm is not determined by the wider business cycle. Anyway, good leaders in a recession innovate revolutionary processes as well as products to mitigate the impact of a hostile climate. Within those grey clouds lie riches galore - and that is as true today as ever it was. </p> <p>For example, how about an industry whose current sales exceed $20bn and are predicted to continue growing at 8 to 10 per cent? Five leading makers of executive jets are rubbing their hands - alas, none of them British. Yet wasn't there a world-beating British civil jet industry once? Perhaps a leader or two missed their strategic inflexion point.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Simon Caulkin is away</p>",
  "<p>In a business famous for tantrums and tiaras, Amancio Ortega is the fashion industry's reluctant hero. His name does not trip off the tongue like that of British Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green, but the shy Spaniard who prefers jeans to suits is the brains behind Zara, the fast-fashion phenomenon that is the pretender to Gap's crown as the world's largest clothing retailer. </p> <p>In the first quarter of the year Zara's parent company, Inditex, outsold its US rival for the first time, posting sales of \u20ac2.2bn (\u00a31.7bn) for the three months to April. If the momentum continues, it could usurp Gap, which had sales of $15.8bn (\u00a38.5bn) last year.</p> <p>The march of Zara has propelled Ortega, a high-school dropout, into the ranks of the super-rich. The son of a railway worker started making dressing gowns and lingerie in his living room before opening his first shop in 1975. Now he is worth an estimated $20.2bn.</p> <p>Ortega is seriously low profile, living with his second wife in a discreet apartment block in the centre of his home town of La Coru\u00f1a, a seaport in Galicia, north-west Spain. Until Inditex (short for Industria de Dise\u00f1o Textil - 'Textile Design Industry'), listed on the stock exchange in 2001, only a handful of photographs were in circulation. </p> <p>A fit 72-year-old - he works out for two hours a day - Ortega can still be found at Zara's futuristic HQ, nicknamed 'the Cube' by employees. He ranked eighth on the Forbes 2008 rich list.</p> <p>He spent the first decade conquering the domestic market, crossing the border into Portugal in 1988. Next stop, world domination: Zara now has nearly 4,000 stores in 70 countries that pumped out sales of \u20ac9.4bn in 2007. Under his watchful eye, Inditex chief executive Pablo Isla continues to lead one of the fastest roll-outs in retail history. Last year the retailer opened another 560 stores around the world, and 640 are planned this year. Indeed, the scale of its ambition has worried investors, who question its growth plans as consumer spending slows in several of its key markets - sentiment that has hit its share price.</p> <p>The retailer has become a textbook example of an ultra-modern business for its ability to marry design, marketing and retailing flair with world-class IT and logistics. Unlike rival giants such as Gap, it measures lead times in weeks rather than months. An existing style can be back in the stores inside a fortnight, but even an entirely new Zara garment takes only five weeks or so from design to delivery. For example, when Spain's Crown Prince Felipe announced his engagement to Letizia Ortiz Rocasolano in 2003, the bride-to-be wore a stylish white trouser suit. Within a few weeks, hundreds of European women were wearing a close approximation. </p> <p>Zara's store managers note what customers buy, then feed the data back to HQ. In a typical year, Zara launches 11,000 styles versus Gap's 2,000 to 4000, with Inditex making two-thirds of its goods in Spain as opposed to the Far East, arguing that the flexibility counteracts higher labour costs.</p> <p>During the Nineties, Inditex began to branch out through acquisition or by developing new brands in-house so as to target different shopper segments. Although Zara is by far its biggest chain, with 1,400 stores, it has seven other fascias, four of them with a UK presence: Bershka, Pull and Bear, Massimo Dutti and Zara Home. There are no imminent plans to import the others - Stradivarius, lingerie chain Oysho, or accessories brand Uterque.</p> <p>Zara arrived in Britain in 1998, and has since opened 80 stores. Its Iberian charm has turned out to be a slow burner and the rate of expansion in UK is regarded as evidence that the retailer is finding Britain a harder nut to crack than other European markets.</p> <p>Ortega, who has also invested in gas, tourism and banks as well as property, remains Inditex's largest shareholder. Of his three children, his daughter Marta, who is in her twenties, is expected to take over when he retires. It is said that Ortega likes to lead a quiet life; luckily his clothes speak volumes.</p> <h2>H&amp;M: hot Swedish cheap-chic</h2> <p><strong>Another dynastic firm, its Stella McCartney range turned sane women into 'shopzillas' and it has now made a breakthrough into the tough American market </strong></p> <p>There are no Henneses or Mauritzes behind H&amp;M: just the Perssons, a no-nonsense Swedish clan who have conquered the cheap-chic market. When it is on the fashion pulse the consequences can be dramatic: the Stella McCartney range turned sane women into 'shopzillas', wrestling to get their hands on her cut-price designs. When it opened its first store in Hong Kong in 2007 customers camped outside for 48 hours.</p> <p>H&amp;M's name is a reflection of the dynasty's pragmatic founder Erling Persson, who chose the name 'Hennes' - Swedish for 'hers' - because the first store sold only women's clothes. Persson, a salesman, got the idea on a business trip to the US just after the Second World War. The H&amp;M credo was born when he visited a retailer that appeared to balance high sales volumes with low prices. Persson opened the first Hennes store in his native city of Vasteras in 1947. </p> <p>H&amp;M grew steadily during the Fifties and Sixties, adding 'Mauritz' in 1968 after buying hunting and gun store Mauritz Widforss. But it was under the leadership of Erling's son Stefan, who took charge of the international business in the late Seventies, that the seeds of global success were sown. Today Stefan's personal fortune is estimated at $17.1bn while his sister Liselott - Lottie to her friends - has $2bn.</p> <p>Stefan oversaw a period of rapid expansion before stepping up to be chief executive in 1982. H&amp;M is now a global powerhouse with 1,500 stores in 28 countries. Last year it made a \u00a31.6bn profit on sales of \u00a37.8bn. Unlike Zara and Mango, the UK is important to H&amp;M and has become its second-largest market in sales terms after Germany. In a further sign of its fashion mettle, H&amp;M has managed to make a go of the US, a market that has defeated many European rivals. It opened its first store in New York in 2000 and now has 150 shops. </p> <p>After a turbulent year that has seen sales vary dramatically from month to month, H&amp;M cheered analysts last week by reporting a better than expected 3 per cent increase in underlying sales for July.</p> <p>H&amp;M has opted to collaborate with big-name designers and celebrities on clothing collections. In addition to McCartney, it has worked with Karl Lagerfeld and Roberto Cavalli as well as Kylie and Madonna. The strategy is very different to that of Inditex, which spends very little on marketing. Although not as nippy at 'fast-fashion' as Inditex, H&amp;M, which does not own any factories, says it meets demand for new styles with daily deliveries of stock to its stores.</p> <p>Despite the retailer's association with celebrity, it does not seek fashion PR at any price. It dropped supermodel Kate Moss from ads in 2005 after photos of her allegedly taking drugs were published in the British press. The move was said to reflect the family's staunch anti-drug stance - Stefan is on the board of a substance abuse charity. A keen sportsman, the 60-year-old is a fan of downhill skiing, golf and tennis. His only vice is thought to be Savile Row suits.</p> <p>Stefan stepped up to the chairmanship in 1998 but there is evidence that fashion is in the genes. Of the new generation now involved in the business, his son Karl-Johan is tipped for great things. He is the business's development director, a role that sees him heading its fledgling chain Cos, the first new brand in its 60-year history. Cos targets more affluent shoppers - handbags at dawn as the Swedes head for a high-street showdown with Inditex's upmarket Massimo Dutti chain.</p> <h2>Mango: the power of youth and celebrity bears fruit</h2> <p><strong>From a stall in a Barcelona street market, Isak Andic has stretched his fashion chain round the world and is now planning to spend \u20ac760m in doubling its turnover</strong></p> <p>Mango has sashayed up the UK high street with the help of Spanish siren Pen\u00e9lope Cruz. The 'Madonna of Madrid' is part of a gaggle of celebrities ranging from Liz Hurley to Lauren Hutton the Spanish chain hires to grab fashion column inches. The glamorous faces in its advertising campaigns are far better known than its mercurial, Turkish-born founder, Isak Andic, who emigrated to Spain when he was 13 and started selling T-shirts to fellow students at Barcelona's American High School.</p> <p>The young entrepreneur - worth an estimated \u00a31.6bn today - soon progressed to running a wholesale business, selling clothes in Barcelona's Balmes street market, but realised there was more money in retail and opened the first Mango store in the city in 1984. Like Inditex, the company behind Zara, the retailer has expanded rapidly to 1,000 stores in 90 countries, but, unlike its arch-rival, tends to work with franchise partners. </p> <p>That means Mango's main role is clothing design, and to that end it employs an army of twentysomething women at its sprawling Barcelona headquarters. The average Mango employee is 28 and its wealthy owner, now 53, is so keen to keep Mango young and dynamic that no one says usted - the formal Spanish 'you' - even when addressing him.</p> <p>Little is known about Andic, whose brother Nahman is also involved in the business. The married father of three sits on the board of Banco Sabadell, one of Spain's largest banking groups, and is said to be a keen sailor. He divides his time between homes in his adoptive Spain and Russia.</p> <p>Mango's global store network is fed by hi-tech logistics centres sending out 30,000 items an hour. The retailer generates annual sales of \u20ac1.4bn (\u00a31.1bn), three-quarters of which come from outside Spain, with international sales overtaking the domestic market in 1997. It does not disclose profitability.</p> <p>This year Andic revealed plans to invest \u20ac760m in expansion over the next four years. In that time he expects to double both the size of the chain and its turnover. In an interview in Spanish daily newspaper Cinco D\u00edas, he also quashed speculation that a management reorganisation in 2007 - when Mango formed its first board - was a precursor to a flotation, stating the retailer could finance growth from its own cash flow.</p> <p>British women have not always taken Mango to their hearts and it has had some hiccups during the decade it has been in the UK. But with sales of less than \u00a350m, the market accounts for a small percentage of its turnover. At present the retailer is in expansionary mode, with new stores and concessions planned.</p> <p>It is also seeking to widen its customer appeal, hiring 'It girl' model Alice Dellal to appeal to fashionable youngsters in the UK while also running a campaign featuring 64-year-old former supermodel Lauren Hutton to encourage women of all ages to wear the brand.</p> <h2>UK: big profits for retail's royalty</h2> <p><strong>The retail kings who have shown most staying power on Britain's high streets are all billionaires who prefer to keep their fashion business in the family</strong></p> <p>There is no shortage of retail royalty in the UK with Sir Philip Green, River Island founder Bernard Lewis and Primark scion George Weston all fashion billionaires.</p> <p>Green leads the fashion rat pack, sharing an estimated \u00a34.3bn fortune with his wife Tina. Monaco-based Green is one of the highest profile businessmen in Britain having made a financial killing in 2002 from the \u00a3850m purchase of Arcadia, which owns seven brands including Topshop, Miss Selfridge and Dorothy Perkins Green, who also owns BHS, made history by paying his family a \u00a31.2bn dividend three years later. It is too early to say if he has founded a dynasty as his children Chloe and Brandon are still teenagers although few would bet against it.</p> <p>Compared to the colourful Green, Lewis is the 'quiet man' of retail. With 60 years in the rag trade under his belt he is unapologetically old school with staff said to address him as 'Mr Bernard'. However, good manners have not stopped Lewis building a \u00a31.6bn fortune. At 82, he is still involved in the day-to-day running of an empire that through the family vehicle, the Lewis Trust, spans property, banking and hotels in addition to River Island. Retail was in his veins as he grew up over his parents' fruit shop on the Holloway Road, where he claims to have served customers while still in short trousers. In 1948 he started a clothing shop with his brothers, David, Godfrey and Geoffrey - today River Island has sales of close to \u00a3900m. The Lewis Trust is dominated by Lewises, with several generations now working alongside each other in the business. As for succession, Mr Bernard shows no sign of giving up his day job yet.</p> <p>George Weston was also destined for a career in retail. He is the third generation of a dynasty that has established retail empires in both the UK and North America. He is the son of Garry, the British publicity-shy architect of Associated British Foods, which owns Primark. His family is worth a cool \u00a31bn.</p> <h2>Benetton: master of the shock tactic</h2> <p><strong>Notorious for its advertising in the Nineties, fast fashion made the maverick brand seem outdated. Now a new generation of the clan is about to take over</strong></p> <p>Gory shots of newborns, copulating horses, a priest and a nun kissing... the Benetton brand is widely remembered for its controversial Oliviero Toscani advertising campaigns of the Nineties.</p> <p>The artistic freedom Luciano Benetton gave his photographer friend is typical of the maverick businessman at the head of one of the world's most enduring retail dynasties. With his wavy white hair and spectacles, the charismatic Italian made the retailer famous for art and sport as well as acid-bright jumpers.</p> <p>According to Benetton lore, Luciano left school at 14 after the sudden death of his father, taking a job in a clothing store to support his family. In 1965 he set up a small knitwear company with his sister Giuliana and two younger brothers Carlo and Gilberto in their home town of Treviso, near Venice. Luciano is credited with developing 'industrial fashion' - fashionable clothes sold through a cost-effective system of production and distribution. Initially, many of its stores were franchises. </p> <p>Today the siblings are worth an estimated $6bn (\u00a34.7bn), with 5,500 stores in 120 countries. The company is listed in Milan, Frankfurt and New York, but the family's holding company, Edizione, owns two-thirds of the shares. Over the years they have diversified their considerable wealth, investing in toll-road operator Atlantia and catering group Autogrill. They sold their Formula 1 team to Renault in 2000 but remain patrons of sport, including Treviso's volleyball team. They also own a nearby golf course.</p> <p>Benetton's star burned brightest on the high street in the Nineties, when its sweatshirts and lambswool jumpers acquired cult status among teenagers. But the march of fast fashion, led by Topshop, Zara and H&amp;M, made its conservative styles appear dated and expensive - the same fate suffered by Gap. The group fell into the red in 2002 but has since rebounded to post robust growth; in 2007, it made a profit of \u20ac145m on sales of \u20ac2bn and has made a strong start this year with sales ahead 5 per cent in the first half. But it has struggled to regain its best form in the UK and over the past five years has overhauled the chain, closing stores and introducing fast fashion.</p> <p>Despite its globetrotting, the group remains rooted in north-eastern Italy, an economy that combines a strong artisan tradition with an abundant labour supply due to the decline of agriculture. Older employees say the Benettons use the local dialect rather than formal Italian.</p> <p>With the founding generation now all in their seventies, the baton is being passed to their children, four of whom have been appointed to the Edizione board. However, Luciano's son Alessandro, a Harvard Business School graduate and a former M&amp;A analyst at Goldman Sachs, has emerged as the heir apparent, taking the role of deputy chairman. </p> <p>Luciano says he is coming round to the idea of retiring 'after 40 years in which I have not had time to draw breath'. He plans to sail off into the sunset on Tribu, a 50-metre yacht he had designed to meet exacting environmental and luxury standards; a grand piano and a prosciutto slicer are among the essentials aboard.</p>",
  "<p>Gram Parsons was the unlikeliest candidate for rock stardom. He was born Ingram Cecil Connor III, and the name he shed in his teens gave some indication of his inherited wealth and privilege. He grew up in Waycross, Georgia, in a family environment where excess seems to have been the norm. His father was nicknamed 'Coondog' and lived a life of extremes, hunting with the local rednecks, throwing extravagant parties for his gentrified friends and driving fast cars along the back roads.</p> <p>Parsons' mother Avis was glamorous and haughty to the point of arrogance. 'She participated in a conversation,' said an acquaintance, 'when she thought it was worth listening to.' Parsons inherited both his father's wild streak and his mother's arrogance, but when he wasn't wasted on cocaine, heroin and hard liquor, he possessed an effortless Southern charm that was almost courtly. Keith Richards said of him: 'It's not often you can lie around on a bed with a guy doing cold turkey, in tandem, and still get along.' </p> <p>Like many impressionable young men who came into Richards's orbit, Parsons lived fast, died young and left behind a myth that has grown in his absence. He also left behind at least three classic albums bearing his distinctive imprint: Sweetheart of the Rodeo by the Byrds; The Gilded Palace of Sin by the Flying Burrito Brothers; and his second, and final, solo album, Grievous Angel, a valedictory confirmation of his singular talent as a singer-songwriter and pioneer.</p> <p>On those albums, he created the template for both country rock and the contemporary genre that has come to be known as Americana. Without him, the trajectory of American rock music would have been very different and at least two of the greatest groups of all time, the Byrds and the Rolling Stones, would have developed in radically different ways.</p> <p>Yet in his own lifetime, Parsons's pioneering music went almost unnoticed by the mainstream, being too country for the rock audience and too rock for the country purists. His heroes were the likes of Merle Haggard and Hank Williams and his singing voice, though technically flawed, was perfectly suited to the elucidation of heartbreak and desire, the constants of country music. Rolling Stone magazine once called him 'the most convincing singer of sad songs that I've ever heard'.</p> <p>That sadness, like the charm, had its beginnings in Waycross. I once asked the great music writer Stanley Booth, who grew up in the same area, what life was like there. He paused for a long time, than said: 'It's a Manichaean universe. That's what Northerners don't understand about the South. People live with God on one shoulder and Satan on the other. You can hear that struggle in the music of Jerry Lee Lewis and the young Elvis Presley. And you can hear it in Gram Parsons's music. It determined his whole life.'</p> <p>That life is laid out in all its messy, wayward splendour in David N Meyer's exhaustive, and occasionally exhausting, biography. It is a tale worthy of Tennessee Williams in its Southern Gothic intensity. Parsons fled one aristocracy for another, pitching up in Los Angeles where he hung out with California's hippest rock stars and most notorious groupies and bonded with Keith Richards, much to the chagrin of an insecure Mick Jagger.</p> <p>Parsons pursued Richards to Nellc\u00f4te, the rented mansion in the south of France where the Stones struggled to finish Exile on Main Street, their timetable dictated by the guitarist's spiralling heroin habit. Later, Parsons hired Elvis's Las Vegas backing band to play on his masterpiece Grievous Angel, appalling them on the first recording session by crashing out halfway through a song. Then, a few weeks after the album was finished, he somehow managed to score heroin in the Californian desert and died in Room 8 of the Joshua Tree Inn, which has since become a shrine for fans - as has nearby Cap Rock, where his road manager Phil Kaufman famously burned his body, having stolen it from Los Angeles airport where it was in transit back to the South.</p> <p>About 10 years ago, I spent an evening in Nashville with Kaufman, whose business card describes his occupation as 'Road Mangler' and who once did time with Charles Manson. He drank a succession of triple tequilas and spoke of his exploits with the glee of the eternal adolescent. He is, as Meyer notes, not the kind of guy you would want managing your life, being, like many roadies, more reckless and debauched even than his more famous charges.</p> <p>He may, as he has often stated, have been fulfilling a pact he made with Gram Parsons when he drove his body into the high desert, but the grotesque nature of his drunken, drug-fuelled escapade remains blindingly obvious to everyone but him. Still unrepentant, still excessive, Kaufman does not emerge from Meyer's book with much dignity. Then again, neither does Gram Parsons, who never quite transcended the contradictions of his upbringing.</p> <p>The songs endure, though, and the sad sway of that cracked and faltering voice. After reading Twenty Thousand Roads, you may, like me, feel the need to reacquaint yourself with the great song from which its title is taken, the windswept ode to freedom and regret that is 'Return of the Grievous Angel'. Best to remember Gram Parsons this way, a young man, not yet 27, carried by the power of his singular vision, singing his bittersweet version of the blues and, in the process, reimagining American rock music.</p>",
  "<p>Eagerly they came - the young, the ambitious, the smartest of the smart. They queued impatiently and crowded into the rafters above Charlie's Cafe at the 'Googleplex', the curving glass and steel cathedral of the internet age. Finally, laptops snapped shut and the room hushed. It was time for Barack Obama to preach to the converted. 'There is something improbable about this gathering,' said the presidential hopeful, gazing around a sea of T-shirts at Google's Californian headquarters. 'What we share is a belief in changing the world from the bottom up.'</p> <p>It was last November and Obama was asked whether he lacked political experience. He compared himself with the founders of Google, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, who a decade ago were university students with a big dream. 'I suppose Sergey and Larry did not have a lot of experience starting a Fortune 100 company,' he said.</p> <p>The rock star of American politics resonates at Google. Nicole Resz, a 26-year-old employee, said: 'He's fresh, he's new. There's something about him that's Google-like.' He was also the seventh presidential candidate to visit the company, following John McCain and Hillary Clinton, each seemingly determined to prove they had achieved that summit of modern aspiration - to be 'Google-like'.</p> <p>Can anyone become President of the United States without the patronage of Google? It was once a ridiculous question, but not any more. The fastest growing company in history is also arguably the most powerful. It has the potential to reach into every corner of our lives, from the way we get news, watch entertainment and do our jobs to the way we communicate, seek information and comprehend the world. Its clean white homepage and breezy colourful logo have become so embedded in our psyches that we 'google' without thinking (and use 'google' as a verb). I think, therefore I google. </p> <p>Ten years ago next month, in an innocuous suburban garage, Page and Brin, two geeky students at Stanford University, founded a company called Google. They would go on to create what is regularly voted the world's top brand, earn accolades as the world's best employers and become billionaires many times over. They would also, say their critics, cut a swathe through the laws of copyright, threaten to devour media like a 'digital Murdoch' and harvest more of our secrets than any totalitarian government - smashing the core certainties of advertising executives, book publishers, newspaper owners, television moguls and civil libertarians.</p> <p>Brin and Page's mission is to 'organise the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful'. They are doing it every minute of every day in indexed web searches, in blogs, in books, in email, in maps, in news, in photos, in videos, in their own encyclopedia. They have built a giant electronic brain made up of farms of computer servers connected around the world, a brain that learns and gains intelligence every time someone uses Google.</p> <p>It is the stuff of science fiction and it all happened so fast that no one could quite grasp it, still less try to stop it. Now all of us, from the farmer in Africa switching on his first internet connection to the next President of the United States, are learning to live in a Google world. It is conceivable that future historians will regard the first day of Google Inc on 7 September 1998, and not 11 September 2001, as the true dawn of the 21st century.</p> <p>'I don't think it's possible to exaggerate the significance of this thing,' says Andrew Keen, a British-born author and entrepreneur in California's Silicon Valley, cradle of the hi-tech boom. 'Every time I think of it, I'm amazed at every level. They're absolutely in the business of revolutionising the nature of knowledge; search has become integral in the way we think and act. In 50 or 100 years' time, when the real histories get written of the internet, it will start with those two boys at Stanford.'</p> <p>But Keen has a warning about the gatekeepers of cyberspace. 'They have amassed more information about people in 10 years than all the governments of the world put together. They make the Stasi and the KGB look like the innocent old granny next door. This is of immense significance. If someone evil took them over, they could easily become Big Brother.'</p> <p>Google's recent acquisition of an online advertising company called DoubleClick set alarm bells ringing. There were objections that it would give the company a near monopoly of the online ad market, widening its scope to collect users' personal data, but Google's powerful lobbyists helped ensure the deal was cleared by regulators in America and Europe. Politicians, such as the Democratic senator Herb Kohl, have belatedly started to ask whether it is growing too fast too soon. Last week America's House Committee on Energy and Commerce heard evidence of how Google and other companies track users' web surfing behaviour.</p> <p>Search engines are probably more important than ever to navigate the hyper-inflating internet: Google recently catalogued its trillionth web page. The company does not dominate in every country, notably China, but has just improved its share of the American market to 70 per cent. The technical wizardry surging through its colossal data centres to deliver instant results, however, only goes halfway to explaining how this altruistic start-up came to be seen as a corporate Death Star.</p> <p>From the beginning Page and Brin wanted to make information available for free and did not care much for business. They were backed by investment capital for the first three years and made virtually no profit. It was only when Google started placing relevant adverts beside its search results, and on other websites, that dollars came pouring in by the million and billion. It was a model that redefined the way business is done on the web for all sorts of participants: build traffic by giving content away for free, then make money from advertising. The formula is said to account for 99 per cent of Google's annual revenue of $16.6bn and profits of $4.2bn.</p> <p>The change has rattled old certainties and some producers of content have cried foul. They accuse Google of infringing copyright by using material without their permission or failing to give them a fair share of the profits. The debate will only intensify as eyeballs turn away from television and newspapers towards computer screens, where Google has an estimated two-thirds market share. Yet the company has also begun using its expertise to sell adverts in the old media of newspapers, radio and TV.</p> <p>Furthermore, when Google said all the world's information, it really meant all. Google News, launched in 2002, aggregates breaking stories from traditional media sources around the world. Newspapers complain that their hard-won exclusives are being hijacked to boost Google's profits. A group of Belgian papers successfully argued in court that the company stored their content without paying or asking permission and are now seeking damages of \u00a339m. In 2004 Google announced partnerships with leading libraries and universities to scan digitally millions of books from their collections. Today a visitor to Google Book Search can read on screen or download the full text of Oliver Twist, The Wealth of Nations or innumerable other out-of-copyright titles. A search will also bring up parts of books still in copyright.</p> <p>Google Maps and Google Earth, launched in 2005, offer an astonishing interactive map of the planet, stitched together from aerial and satellite footage licenced from Nasa and various private companies. Google Street View, released in America last year, takes this a step further by providing photographs taken at eye level, which has prompted media alarm about invasion of privacy; the company insists the UK version, yet to launch, will obscure faces and licence plates.</p> <p>But it was Google's acquisition in 2006 of YouTube, the phenomenally popular video sharing site, that caught most attention as a disrupter of the old media landscape. Its willingness to let people post and watch video clips for free has panicked the TV and film industries and provoked a $1bn lawsuit from the US entertainment group Viacom for 'massive copyright infringement'.</p> <p>Google's tentacles are everywhere. It runs services for blogging, email, instant messaging, shopping and social networking. It offers a suite of word processing, spreadsheet and other tools to rival Microsoft's products in the workplace. It is building a software platform for mobile phones that may challenge Apple's iPhone and others. It has just launched Knol, a peer-reviewed encyclopedia to take on Wikipedia. In America, Google Health enables users to maintain their own medical records. The company is also working on language translation, speech recognition and video search. Brin and Page even have their eyes on space: they have offered a $20m prize to anyone who can make a privately financed spacecraft able to land on the moon.</p> <p>Could this be too much responsibility for any single institution, let alone a multinational corporation? Google's informal motto, 'Don't be evil', is put to the test every day. An entity born in the laid-back utopianism of northern California now finds itself a $157bn global business empire, chasing profits, fighting or gobbling up competitors, blowing old business models away like matchsticks. And just as coal, steel and oil barons were once courted by politicians, today it is the turn of the masters of information. There is a political love affair going on with Google that both reflects and reinforces its position at front and centre of world affairs.</p> <p>Shortly after Obama's pilgrimage to the 'Googleplex', it was the turn of David Cameron. Cameron was accompanied there by Steve Hilton, his director of strategy, who has since moved permanently to California with his wife, Rachel Whetstone, Google's vice-president of global communications and public affairs (she is also godmother to Cameron's eldest son, Ivan). Andrew Orlowski, executive editor of the technology website The Register, says: 'The web is a secular religion at the moment and politicians go to pray at events like the Google Zeitgeist conference. Any politician who wants to brand himself as a forward-looking person will get himself photographed with the Google boys.'</p> <p>Washington, also, is keen to bathe in Google's golden light. Al Gore, the former Vice-President, is a long-time senior adviser at the company. Obama has been taking economic advice from Google CEO Eric Schmidt and received generous donations from Google and its staff. Google will be omnipresent at the Democratic and Republican national conventions, providing software for delegates such as calendars, email and graphics. 'Google has moved into the political world this year,' says its director of policy communications, Bob Boorstin, a former member of the Clinton administration.</p> <p>Google's staff in Washington include five lobbyists, among them Pablo Chavez, former general counsel for John McCain. This year Google moved into new 27,000-square-foot headquarters in one of Washington's most fashionable, eco-friendly buildings. Visiting senators and congressmen can now share in the famed 'googly' experience of free gourmet lunches, giant plasma screens and a game room, named 'Camp David', stocked with an Xbox 360 and pingpong. </p> <p>None of this much impressed Jeff Chester, the executive director of the small but influential Center for Digital Democracy, when he was invited there. 'It puts all the other lobbying operations to shame,' he says. 'They invite politicians into their Washington HQ to give advice on using Google to win re-election. It is the darling of the Democratic Party and there's no doubt that a win by Obama will strengthen Google's position in Washington.'</p> <p>Boorstin dismisses the claims, pointing out that rivals such as Microsoft, AT&amp;T and Verizon spend far more on lobbying and have been doing so much longer. He adds: 'It's a statement I find both funny and pathetic.'</p> <p>Chester, however, is an outspoken critic on a crusade. He continues: 'Google have been very hypocritical. They try to place a digital halo around their activities. They should be at the forefront of acknowledging that these are the most powerful marketing tools around and there should be safeguards in place. Google claims it's there to provide information but it's really there to collect data and provide advertising, and they simply can't own up to it.'</p> <p>These concerns do not apply to America alone. As chairman of the parliamentary Culture, Media and Sport Committee, John Whittingdale has clashed with Google several times, including most recently over whether YouTube should do more to block offensive content. 'There's no doubt they are extraordinarily powerful,' he says. 'There is concern about their dominance in online advertising. When someone is in such a strong position, you have to at least look at it. There is also the issue of behaviourally targeted advertising [the supply of ads deemed relevant based on the user's browsing history] which needs a code of conduct.'</p> <p>Like others before him, Whittingdale was struck by the peculiarity of Google's internal culture when he visited the Californian HQ. 'It's a bit like a cross between The Stepford Wives and Logan's Run: lots of happy people in shorts always smiling, and nobody over 40. All these bright young graduates playing softball in grounds while having great thoughts.'</p> <p>Google's laid-back ambience is credited as a key part of its success. Free perks for staff include three healthy meals a day, massages and laundry services as well as an on-site gym and swimming pool. Casually dressed engineers are often seen playing pool, volleyball or roller hockey, or sprawling on multi-coloured bean bags.</p> <p>Despite its environmental projects and its philanthropic arm, the perception of Google is slowly morphing from plucky David to sinister Goliath. In the words of former Intel chief executive Andy Grove, it is increasingly seen as a company 'on steroids, with a finger in every industry'. From a garage in suburbia, they are saying, came the company that ate the world.</p> <p>Number 232, Santa Margarita Avenue, Menlo Park, California, looks like another ordinary house in another ordinary street. Susan Wojcicki bought the four-bedroom property for about $600,000 in 1998 and rented out the garage to two Stanford students for $1,700 a month to help with the mortgage. Larry Page and Sergey Brin had met three years earlier when Brin was a tour guide for new students at Stanford University and Page was in his group. At first the pair, both born in 1973, found each other 'obnoxious'. But it was the start of a lucrative friendship.</p> <p>Page was interested in the maths of the fledgling world wide web and began studying how it linked together. His great insight was to think about websites like academic papers, which build arguments through citations of previous papers (and list them in the footnotes). Similarly, websites contain links which, when clicked on, take the user to another website. Page realised that the number of links to a page would be a useful guide to its relative importance. He worked with the Russian-born Brin to create an unfathomably complex algorithm which could rank pages in terms of relevance, then turn it into a search engine for the web. The first version of Google - named after googol, the term for 1 followed by 100 zeros - was released on the Stanford website in August 1996.</p> <p>Page and Brin have been described as the Thomas Edisons of the internet. Like many of history's great inventors, they were in the right place at the right time, riding the wave of the dotcom boom and riding out the subsequent crash. The co-founders never meant to build a business but now enjoy the fruits of success, flying around the world in a Boeing 767, kitesurfing and pursuing passions such as the environment: both own Toyota Prius cars. Brin and Page remain joint presidents, Brin in charge of technology, Page responsible for product launches, but the rapid growth of recent years has been steered by chief executive Eric Schmidt, 53, who came on board in 2001 as the commercial 'brain', negotiating the founders' evangelism and the shareholders' thirst for profits. It has been jokingly said that he provides 'adult supervision'.</p> <p>Now the biggest issue facing Google - the one that an unnamed Google executive has dubbed the 'atom bomb' - is privacy. Google is the most efficient information-gathering machine ever built. Every time you use it to search the web, the query you typed, the time and date, and the IP address and unique 'cookie' ID assigned to your computer are recorded and retained for 18 months. If you log in to one of Google's personalised services, such as Google Checkout, the company collects data tied to your sign-in. Its main objective is to learn about your preferences so it can give you better search results (did you mean 'Paris Hilton' the celebrity, or the hotel?) and target you with relevant adverts.</p> <p>Peter Fleischer, Google's global privacy counsel, says the company is making every effort to be transparent about what data it is gathering, including a series of explanatory videos on YouTube. He goes on: 'We offer services in two flavours. If you don't sign in, but go straight to search, then for all essential purposes the information is anonymous. If you do sign in, it'll remember your browsing history and give you the benefits of personalised search. Even for these services you can use a pseudonym: Google doesn't need to know and doesn't want to know your real name.' It is true that Google doesn't force anyone to reveal anything. But to quote a book currently popular among politicians, its users are 'nudged' towards entering more and more information about themselves in exchange for personalised services. Google can save you time and money, find a restaurant to your taste or a chemist to cure your illness, but only if it knows you well enough. Help it to help you; that is the siren song. Schmidt raised eyebrows on a trip to London last year when he declared: 'We cannot even answer the most basic questions about you because we don't know enough about you. The goal is to enable Google users to be able to ask questions such as \"What shall I do tomorrow?\" and \"What job should I take?\" This is the most important aspect of Google's expansion.'</p> <p>A month later, the human rights watchdog Privacy International ranked the company bottom in a major survey of how securely the leading internet companies handle their users' personal information. Liberty, the civil liberties organisation, and the National Consumer Council have also expressed concern.</p> <p>These are early shots in a long war over how much Google the world can stomach. Many within the technology industry are unwilling to call on government to clip its wings because it goes against their faith in an open internet, free of state interference. But the European Parliament is already scrutinising Google, and some believe it is only a matter of time before Ofcom, the media regulator in Britain, is forced to intervene. Orlowski of The Register says: 'It's the big regulatory issue of the next 10 years: how politicians deal with Google. If the web is as important as the politicians say, it seems odd that one company sets the price and defines the terms of business.'</p> <p>Others believe the free market will throw up alternatives, just as it did to the mighty Microsoft. Vasanthan Dasan, one of the web's pioneers and now an engineer at Sun Microsystems, perceives three threats to Google's dominance. 'First, social networks such as Facebook and MySpace are transforming information about you in a much more targeted and finely grained way; Google is behind on that. Second, mobile phones will become increasingly useful for information, and Google is behind on that too. Finally, there are quite a few companies working on personal genomics: knowing what your genes are so can you see your profile for genetic diseases and find customised medicine. Google will have a lot of challenges.' </p> <p>But what also seems certain is that, along with its sway over advertising, media and publishing, Google will seek to conquer domains that no one but Page and Brin have even dreamed of. In a world where television schedules are obsolete and content can be summoned on demand, for example, a search engine that can find the clip or programme you want will be more important than ever.</p> <p>'The problem with Google now is that they have to keep growing,' says Andrew Keen. 'If they wanted to, they could destroy the publishing business and kill newspapers. Everything they do has a profound impact. It's like that saying about America: when Google sneezes, the rest of the world catches a cold.'</p> <p>Born into the idealism of Silicon Valley, now courted by candidates for the White House, Google is not like other companies. It is colonising and drilling the mental space, a Shell or BP of information. Its casually dressed young staff, generally the brightest and best, have always typically asked: 'Why not?' It is now employing some wiser heads to explain why sometimes the answer really does have to be 'not'. It may already be too late. The thing of wonder that Page and Brin gave the world 10 years ago became an 800lb gorilla in record time. But no one remembered to ask - what happens when a gorilla just keeps growing and growing?</p> <p>\u00b7 Read David Smith's blog post and let us know your thoughts<br> on Google on the <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/technology/\">technology blog</a></p> <h2>Google by numbers</h2> <p><strong>Googol</strong> Mathematical term for the figure 1 followed by a hundred zeros, after which Brin and Page named their company (complete with spelling mistake).</p> <p><strong>4</strong> Number of people in the company when it started (in a garage in Menlo Park, California, in September 1998).</p> <p><strong>19,604</strong> Number of 'Googlers' (employees) worldwide, many of whom work at the 'Googleplex', the kooky HQ in Santa Clara, CA.</p> <p><strong>70:30</strong> Ratio of male to female employees. </p> <p><strong>60%</strong> Proportion of worldwide internet searches made on Google. </p> <p><strong>86%</strong> Proportion of total UK searches made on Google.</p> <p><strong>25,000 </strong>Number of web pages indexed by Google early on; today it's in the billions.

  "<p>It began when five men stole into the rustic village of Tkviavi. With its plum trees, walnut groves and vines, Tkviavi was one of a jigsaw of picturesque villages beneath the hulking mountains of central Georgia. Up the road was Tskhinvali - the grim Soviet-style capital of the backward rebel statelet of South Ossetia. Down the road was Gori, a town once more famous for its association with an unpromising cobbler's son, Josef Stalin.</p> <p>The men arrived outside Elene Maisuradze's modest cottage. Waving guns and speaking rapidly in Russian, they wanted to know where Elene had hidden her Lada. One of them was Ossetian; the others had come from Russia. 'I told them I had sold it,' she said. 'They asked me: \"Where are the boys?\" I said my sons were away. They took everything from my house, turned it upside down and left.'</p> <p>Soon more paramilitaries, armed with Kalashnikovs, turned up. 'They wanted to know where my basement was. I told them and said: \"We have plenty of wine. Please take it.\" They went to the basement, shot it up and came back. I was crying. They said in Russian: \"Rastreli, rastreli (kill her, kill her).\" My neighbour, a Russian woman, told them: \"Don't do this.\" They shot into the ground and said: \"Fuck Saakashvili.\" '</p> <p>The militia gangs were part of a murderous wave unleashed by Russia last week on Georgian civilians. The Russian army has now advanced deep into Georgian territory, capturing at least a third of the country, including Gori, the Black Sea port of Poti and the western towns of Senaki and Zugdidi. Yesterday they were within 12 miles of Tbilisi, the capital.</p> <p>At the same time, gangs of Chechen and Ossetian irregulars have been busy carrying out their own private ethnic cleansing. All week fires burned in Tkviavi, Karaleti, Eredvi and other looted villages along the South Ossetian border; smoke plumed across the valley and into the hazy Upper Caucasus.</p> <p>Survivors described how the irregulars roamed from house to house. They sifted out villagers with Georgian surnames, immediately executing all teenage boys. Nugzari Jashashvili, 65, was returning home across the fields when he saw gunmen approach the house of his neighbour, Gela Chikladze, 50. 'They cut his throat,' Jashashvili said. The same five-man gang looted his house and stole his generator.</p> <p>Jasashvili said the gunmen killed his cousin Koba, 40, and another man. They took two other local men hostage. After watching his neighbour's murder, Jashashvili hid in a cornfield.</p> <p>Once they had gone, he escaped, fleeing for three days across the fields towards Gori. 'We lived off peaches, apples and plums,' Jashashvili said. 'There wasn't any water. We drank very little.'</p> <p>Those spared were mainly the elderly. After gunmen came to her home Maisuradze, 73, also fled, packing an icon and other possessions in two plastic bags, and leaving the village on foot. 'The gunmen were laughing at us,' she said. One of her group - a 93-year-old woman - died on the road. 'We had to leave her,' Maisuradze said. She passed through burning villages full of corpses. 'There were bodies everywhere. I saw two dead women from my village lying on the ground. Everything was on fire.'</p> <p>Russia's war in Georgia is about more than just punishing Mikheil Saakashvili, Georgia's pro-American President, whose doomed military incursion into South Ossetia 10 days ago caused the most serious crisis between Russia and the West since the Cold War.</p> <p>The objectives of Russia's Prime Minister, Vladimir Putin, are much bigger: to create a new global order in which the US and Russia are equal partners again. Putin has frequently lamented the demise of the Soviet Union. He has described it as the greatest geo-political catastrophe of the 20th century. For Putin, the 1990s under Boris Yeltsin was a period of national humiliation in which a weakened Russia was forced to accept Western economic help and which saw former members of the Warsaw Pact embrace Nato, the West's military club.</p> <p>Over the past two years, Putin has given ample warning of his intentions to overturn the status quo in international affairs. Last year in Munich he launched a vituperative attack on America, denouncing its 'unilateralism'. The Kremlin has criticised Nato's westward expansion and the Bush administration's deal with Warsaw last week to site missile defence systems in Poland and the Czech Republic. Nato membership for Ukraine and Georgia would, Putin made clear, be the final straw.</p> <p>Putin's aim, it appears, is to rewrite history, in particular the narrative that suggests that Russia lost the Cold War. Over the previous eight years as President, he has fashioned Russia into an advanced post-modern authoritarian state, governed by former KGB officers whose attitudes to the West were forged under communism. Putin has apparently never been reconciled to Russia's new boundaries, which left millions of ethnic Russians living outside the borders of the Russian Federation in Ukraine, Georgia, the Baltic states and Central Asia.</p> <p>Nor is there any doubt about ordinary Russians' views about the war in Georgia. 'Suck it and cry,' announced one piece of graffiti on a Moscow wall, an opinion echoed by most Muscovites.</p> <p>'The Georgians were absolutely in the wrong,' said Igor Pavlov, 23, a driver.</p> <p>'They got what they were asking for.' Andrei Teryoshin, a 35-year-old businessman, agreed: 'We were fighting to defend the people of South Ossetia, and I am proud of that.'</p> <p>Anatoly Pavlov, a theatre director, went further: 'I want to complain about the one-sided reporting from the West. Your reports are not correct; they are not right. The West has been reflecting only the Georgian point of view.' Nor was there any doubt about who was the initial aggressor.</p> <p>'It's perfectly obvious - Georgia, of course. And it's not the first time either,' said pensioner Felix Bezik.</p> <p>'This Saakashvili bloke, it's clear he's just an American puppet,' added Ivan Sidorov, 63, a sports instructor. 'That's how I see it: either he's sick or he's evil, the way he's treated Russia.'</p> <p>At the same time analysts at the Kremlin have given free rein to conspiracy theories. Sergei Markov put the Caucasus crisis down to a dastardly plot by Dick Cheney, US Vice-President, and Republican presidential candidate John McCain. A confrontation with Russia would be extremely useful just before the US presidential election, exposing Democratic candidate Barack Obama's inexperience in foreign and security policy and boosting McCain's chances. Such is the paranoid world view of an analyst well connected to the entourage of Vladimir Putin, who guarantee that such scenarios get an extensive airing on the Kremlin-controlled TV channels.</p> <p>With such views being expressed at home, Putin clearly feels he is in a strong domestic position as he presses to get back some of Russia's old territory. Georgian observers expect Putin swiftly to absorb Georgia's secessionist provinces of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, which broke away from Tbilisi during the 1992-93 civil war. Both regions are likely to hold popular referendums on a formal or semi-formal union with the Russian Federation. Russia will justify this de facto annexation by pointing to the need to protect Abkhaz and Ossetian citizens from Georgian aggression.</p> <p>'I expect this to happen within a couple of days,' said Zaza Gachechildaze, a Georgian analyst who predicted a war between Russia and Georgia in August. South Ossetia would vote to unify with Russian North Ossetia, while Abkhazia would declare itself independent and then associate with Russia, he said. Nor will this bring an end to Putin's ambitions, he said. His next target is likely to be Ukraine - in particular, the Crimea, home to Russia's Black Sea Fleet.</p> <p>For Nana Tetsladi, 35, there were no doubts last week about Putin's ruthlessness, or his nonchalant defiance of world opinion. Russian Sukhoi SU-25 bombers pulverised her five-floor block of flats last Sunday, targeting the residential suburb of Verxvebi, on the outskirts of Gori. They bombed for three consecutive days.</p> <p>'We fled 15 minutes before the bombs hit,' Nana said. Not everyone managed to get out, she added. Her pregnant neighbour, Marca, was killed, she said, together with her husband. Their seven-year-old son was injured. The twisted remains of Marca's car still stood outside yesterday, a blackened ruin, smelling of burnt flesh.</p> <p>The bombs also fell on Gori's Stalin Square, next to the grandiose Soviet-era museum to Stalin and the green railway carriage in which the dictator travelled to the 1945 Yalta conference. At least five civilians, including a Dutch journalist, were killed. With no discernible military target, it seems clear that the Kremlin was effecting its own form of collective punishment on the town, 17 miles from the border with South Ossetia.</p> <p>Two days after Russia's President, Dimitry Medvedev, announced he was halting military operations, Russian tanks rolled into the centre of Gori, parking outside its sandstone church. This swift action took residents by surprise.</p> <p>'I saw a soldier on the street. I assumed he was Georgian and asked him in Georgian for a light. He turned round and spoke in Russian,' Giorgi Maraneli, 48, said. 'He gave me a match and we shook hands.'</p> <p>Russian tanks took up positions just outside Gori, chopping the road that connects the east and west of the country and dividing Tbilisi from its Black Sea holiday coast. Yesterday Georgia said Russia bombed the last rail link between the two divided halves, dismembering the small nation still further.</p> <p>The mood on this new front line has sometimes been friendly. Young, multi-ethnic Russian soldiers posed for photographs as armoured personnel carriers clattered through the undergrowth, noisily squashing small fir trees and leaving swirling patterns on the grey tarmac. One 30-year-old Russian officer, Major Nail, from Dagestan, turned out to be both witty and philosophical. Why had he invaded Georgia? 'There isn't any difference between Georgia and Russia,' he suggested. This was his first trip to Georgia, he said, adding: 'The landscape is beautiful. But we also have big mountains in Dagestan.'</p> <p>This innocuous mood is clearly illusory. On Thursday, a drunken South Ossetian general arrived at the Russian checkpoint in a stolen white Lada. He got out, puffing and red-faced, removed his pistol and started firing in the air. One of his henchmen fired into the ground; he then hijacked a United Nations Jeep. A battered mini-van carrying South Ossetian paramilitaries and flying the Russian flag careened down the road to Tbilisi. One was wearing a black balaclava; all were heavily armed; their mood was exuberant. Asked what they were doing, one joked: 'We're on holiday.'</p> <p>After fleeing for three days, Elene Maisuradze began trudging along the dusty road from Gori back to Tbilisi, 40 miles away. Five other villagers had come with her - an old woman dressed in black; a vigorous woman in her seventies and a couple with a young son wearing a green tracksuit. They had clearly come together in a collective struggle to stay alive. A Russian armoured column approached. The group dived into fields and hid behind a mud embankment. After five minutes they emerged - keening and weeping.</p> <p>'My husband died 14 years ago. I wish I'd died soon after him. I can't walk any more,' Maisuradze said, halting under a tree next to a petrol station. She put down her stick and showed off the few possessions she had salvaged - black-and-white photos of her as a young woman, a Bible and her icon of the Virgin Mary. 'My generation grew up during the Second World War. We were always crying. It was a terrible situation,' she said. She added: 'Now I'm old and I'm in a war again.'</p> <p>With Georgia's army beaten off the field of battle, the Kremlin has sent columns of armoured vehicles trundling through the scenic countryside. Every day the Russians get closer to Tbilisi; yesterday they were blocking a junction 12 miles away.</p> <p>These advances have caused panic in Georgia's shattered military. The Georgians have modern kit and American-style Toyota Jeeps, but they have no air force left and no tanks, and are no match for the Russian war machine.</p> <p>These theatrical Russian advances have a clear purpose: to menace Saakashvili and to underscore the irrelevance of European and US diplomacy. Nobody doubts that Putin wants to overthrow Georgia's pro-Western government. It is also personal: Putin's loathing for Saakashvili is boundless, Georgian officials say. 'The idea is to punish Georgia and the Georgian government. And Misha [Saakashvili]. They hate Misha,' said Irakli Batkuashvili, the head of Georgia's military planning division.</p> <p>On Friday, the US Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, condemned Russia's invasion of Georgia and called for an 'immediate withdrawal' of Russian troops. She also said the 'free world' needed to start a debate about the 'profound implications' of Russia's actions. 'You can't be a responsible member of institutions that are democratic and underscore democratic values and on the other hand act in this way against one of your neighbours,' Rice said, after holding almost five hours of talks with Saakashvili at his unfinished hilltop palace in Tbilisi. As she spoke, nine Russian armoured personnel carriers rolled towards her press conference.</p> <p>So far, however, the US assistance to occupied Georgia has only comprised moral support and humanitarian aid. The Bush administration has no plans to offer its ally military assistance with which to take on the Russians. Moreover, the 'free world' has found few levers with which to punish Putin.</p> <p>Rice's comments about the need for the West to re-evaluate its relationship with Moscow appear to be a hint that Russia could soon be excluded - formally or otherwise - from the G8 and other international institutions. The West's most stinging gesture would be to take away the 2014 Winter Olympics from Russia: they are due to be held in Sochi, 12 miles from Abkhazia.</p> <p>None of this is likely to bother the Kremlin much. As Saakashvili pointed out on Friday, the Kremlin has tested the West's reactions with a series of provocative steps, discovering each time that the Europeans generally don't do anything. Dubbing Russia's leadership 'evil' and '21st-century barbarians', Saakashvili lambasted the EU for its feebleness. The Russians had dispatched agents to murder Alexander Litvinenko in a 'nuclear attack', poisoned Ukraine's President, Viktor Yushchenko, and - last month, during Rice's last visit - sent jet fighters into Georgian airspace. The Europeans did nothing, he said. 'Russia has been all the time testing the reactions of the West. It's going to replicate what happened in Georgia elsewhere,' he warned.</p> <p>Certainly there was little sign of any strength of European outrage at events in Georgia. Germany's Chancellor, Angela Merkel, in particular, has said that both sides are to blame, a comment suggesting that Germany's relations with Russia are more important to her than Georgia's struggle for survival.</p> <p>Indeed, it was only until the middle of last week that Europe made any significant diplomatic move to try to end the crisis in Georgia, when the French President, Nicolas Sarkozy, and his Foreign Minister, Bernard Kouchner, exploiting France's European Union presidency, intervened. Kouchner was dispatched first to Tbilisi, then to Moscow, to explore the prospects for a ceasefire and to gauge whether Sarkozy could profit from heading east. The Russians would be happy to talk to Sarkozy, he reported back to the Elys\u00e9e, so the French President went to Moscow and spent hours haggling with Putin instead.</p> <p>The result was a six-point ceasefire plan, essentially on Russia's terms, which Sarkozy then took to Saakashvili in Tbilisi for a midnight session. The proposed pact was a bitter blow to Georgian sovereignty, curbing the activity of its military on its own territory while giving Russia the right to mount patrols and take 'additional security measures' on sovereign Georgian territory. For its part, America was alarmed, though supporting the peace bid in public. En route to Tbilisi, Rice stopped off in France to stiffen Sarkozy's sinews and try to shape the mediation effort.</p> <p>At first the Kremlin said it was in no hurry to sign a deal and only announced late last week that President Medvedev had agreed to the plan. However, Sarkozy could not get Saakashvili to sign at first, and it was only when Rice arrived that the Georgian leader backed down and flourished his pen, bolstered by US emphasis that the Russian security concessions would be limited in time and space. As Rice headed for the presidential ranch in Crawford, Texas, to brief Bush, it appeared that Putin had gambled and won.</p> <p>Nor is it surprising that European reaction to the invasion of Georgia has been so limited. The Europeans - quite simply - have more to lose. Like the Soviet Union's invasion of Czechoslovakia 40 years ago this week, this invasion took place in August. But it is in winter that the Kremlin can exploit Europe's great weakness - by cutting off its oil and gas supplies.</p>",
  "<p>The value of sterling may be plummeting as fears grow over the depth of a possible recession. But in the scenic East Sussex town of Lewes - famous for its bonfire night parties and bewildering number of pubs - a handy alternative is about to become available.</p> <p>Next month, in the latest sign that localism is a coming force in British everyday life, Lewes will launch its own currency. In doing so, it joins a growing list of communities around the world attempting to protect regional economies and preserve the distinctive 'feel' of towns and villages.</p> <p>The Lewes pound will initially be accepted in around 30 locally owned shops and a first run of 10,000-plus notes is expected. It is the largest-scale launch of a local currency in the UK since Lewes had its own pound in the 19th century and, in a coup for the organisers, the town's branch of Barclays bank has agreed to accept it.</p> <p>Those pushing the Lewes pound, which by law cannot display the Queen's head but is legal tender, stress their humble ambitions for the new currency. 'There will always be a need for a national currency, but it's a question of trying to go back to what can be done locally,' said Oliver Dudok van Heel, one of the scheme's architects. 'This is not us versus the rest of the world,' added Beth Ambrose, a sustainability expert, who denied that the Lewes pound was a declaration of independence. 'All we want to do is strengthen what's good in our community.'</p> <p>According to one analysis, 80 per cent of the money that goes into a supermarket till leaves the local economy immediately. By backing local stores such trends can be reversed, say the scheme's supporters. 'We had a beautiful, independent toy shop here once,' van Heel said. 'It's now an estate agent.'</p> <p>Lewes is not alone in its aspirations. In Totnes, Devon, a complementary currency has been running for more than a year. Similar schemes have been launched abroad and it is estimated there are about 9,000 around the world. Across the Atlantic in Berkshire, Massachusetts, some $800,000 worth of local 'Berkshares' are boosting a thriving alternative economy. Switzerland has introduced a localised credit card scheme, while Holland and Germany have had a surge of interest in complementary currencies.</p> <p>Those backing the new schemes say they are 'big tent' projects which try to involve the whole community. Experts agree that they thrive in places where people have become disillusioned with central government, suggesting they reflect more than merely economic concerns.</p> <p>'This is political, but with a small p,' said Patrick Cockburn, a Lewes resident who is backing the new currency. 'It seems a Tory sort of idea - empowering individualism - but it's really about boosting the local community.'</p> <p>In Argentina, demand for local currencies took off after the economy collapsed in the late Nineties. 'These types of currency go right back,' said David Boyle, a fellow at the New Economics Foundation in London. 'There was a flurry of complementary currencies in the Great Depression. But President Roosevelt outlawed them because he was afraid they might undermine the banks.'</p> <p>For this reason, proponents of the Lewes pound believe now is the right time for its launch. 'With the current credit crunch, there is some disquiet about the global economic system,' van Heel acknowledged. 'Who knows how important this could be? Studies show if there is more than 12 per cent unemployment in a community these systems become very popular.'</p> <p>If anywhere can make a new currency work, the locals of Lewes claim it is their town, which prides itself on its independent spirit and the absence of the likes of Starbucks. It already has form when it comes to minor uprisings. After Greene King, the brewing and pub chain, stopped selling the locally brewed Harveys beer and ale at the Lewes Arms there was a mass boycott and the drinks were back within months.</p> <p>Perhaps, then, it is no coincidence that the town's most famous resident is the radical political pamphleteer Thomas Paine, credited with sowing the intellectual seeds of American independence. Etched under a painting of Paine on a wall of one of Lewes's churches is one of his most famous aphorisms: 'We have the power to build the world anew.'</p> <p>Two centuries on, the inhabitants of Lewes have the chance to show in their own small way that they still agree.</p>",
  "<p>When I moved from Germany to London four years ago I needed some furniture for my new flat. I thought that some shelves, a small table and a few chairs would do nicely, so off I went to my nearest Ikea. It looked and felt exactly like the one in Essen, my home town. There too you have to fight your way through the whole store, past all those bathrooms, kitchens and living rooms to reach the useful odds and ends just before the check-out. The menu at the restaurant was also identical: the same salmon steaks and K\u00f6ttbullar meatballs with lingonberry sauce. There was only one thing that was strangely unfamiliar: the prices. They were much higher.</p> <p>I quickly bought a packet of my favourite Swedish biscuits, got a copy of the Ikea catalogue and called my friend Jenny. Jenny is not only a great fan of Ikea, she even learns Swedish (I sometimes wonder whether she wants to talk to the Bj\u00f6rkudden, Fj\u00f6rby and Gran\u00e5s furniture). Most importantly, though, she still lives in Germany. </p> <p>I asked her to take the German Ikea catalogue off her Billy shelf and go through it with me over the phone. It was fascinating. The German and British catalogues had the same products, illustrated with the same pictures on the same pages, but with markedly different prices. The German items were about 20 to 30 per cent cheaper than the same ones in Britain. I realised that it I would have saved a lot of money if I had bought my new furniture back home and then brought it with me to the UK. This was my introduction to the phenomenon commonly known as 'Rip-off Britain'.</p> <p>Over the following years my impression of Britain as an expensive place was confirmed, especially when I compared it with Germany and Australia, the two countries where I had previously lived. Unfortunately, the Ikea price hikes were not the worst difference. Train tickets were bad, too: London to Manchester and Cologne to Hanover are about the same distance, yet a standard second class single will set you back \u00a3115 in Britain but only \u00a349 in Germany. A trip from Berlin-Alexanderplatz to Sch\u00f6nefeld airport costs the equivalent of \u00a31.67. A similar journey from central London to Heathrow, however, is \u00a34 on the tube and \u00a314.50 on the Heathrow Express.</p> <p>Movie tickets are just as bad: on Friday evening you can watch Will Smith's Hancock for \u00a313.45 in London's Leicester Square or for just \u00a38.40 in Sydney's George Street. Australians also put cheaper fuel in their cars: it may seem unbelievable to British motorists, but Sydneysiders are currently complaining about record-breaking fuel prices \u2013 at just under 80p a litre.</p> <p>Britain is one of the most expensive countries on the planet and London its rip-off capital. Filling your car, eating out, staying at a hotel or just doing the weekly shopping are all more costly undertakings than in other industrialised countries around the globe \u2013 even without taking house prices into account. </p> <p>International companies know this and pay their staff premium wages when they send them here. Mercer, a human resources consultancy, estimated that London's cost of living (including housing) was more than a third higher than in cities like Sydney, Amsterdam, Munich or Los Angeles, a difference that would be bearable if there was a corresponding gap in the quality of life. Yet, having thought about it for a long time while my tube train was stuck in a tunnel on Thursday morning, I do not believe this is the case. If anything, life in London is worse than it is in other big, international cities. In a recent worldwide survey, it came 38th on the quality of life score.</p> <p>No company could expect to survive if it offered its customers third world products and services but charged them first world prices, so why should Britain? If the UK continues to be one of the most expensive addresses in the world while it fails to provide the best infrastructure and public services, it should not be surprised if it loses its most qualified people and fails to attract foreign professionals. </p> <p>There is also another problem: while young professionals can vote with their feet and go to places where life is better and cheaper, many people, like those with families, cannot. Unfortunately, they are the ones that are likely to be hit hardest by our excessive price levels. Rising fuel and food prices make life even more difficult for them. There are some things the government should do to help them, and some that it should not.</p> <p>On the one hand, the government cannot do anything to change international oil or food prices and should not try to control domestic ones. But, on the other hand, it can and should create a business environment in which competition is encouraged and taxes are low. For example, it helps parents if they can buy school uniform skirts for their girls for \u00a32 from Asda or 10 fish fingers from Sainsbury's for 49p, but opening a new supermarket is a nightmarish process under English planning law. Another example: while we are all complaining about high fuel prices, the state deserves at least half of the blame. At current prices, almost 60 per cent of the price of a litre of petrol is made up of fuel duty and VAT.</p> <p>High taxes and complex regulations have both contributed to the phenomenon of rip-off Britain. In particular, a lack of land supply due to planning constraints has pushed up land prices. But somebody has to pay for this, and in the end it is consumers that are footing the bill for our failed planning policies.</p> <p>If we care about our quality of life and the cost of living taxes and regulation should be tackled. In the meantime, there is only one way to get my favourite Ikea biscuits at a reasonable price: buy them when I next visit Germany.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Dr Oliver Marc Hartwich is the chief economist at Policy Exchange</p>",
  "<p>In the second half of the 18th century, a craze for authenticity swept European elites. Discerning people preferred sincerity to cleverness, the natural to the sophisticated, as they revolted against the cold scientific discoveries of the Enlightenment. Rousseau's praise for the honest virtues of simple peasants moved Marie Antoinette. She ordered architects to design the Hameau de la Reine in the grounds of Petit Trianon at Versailles and filled the surrounding fields with tame cows for the ladies of the court to milk with churns made of S\u00e8vres porcelain.</p> <p>The doomed queen's rustic 'cottage', which looked more like a manor house to outsiders, was one of European royalty's great PR disasters. As Simon Schama says in his history of the French Revolution, her beribboned cows and Alpine sheep 'were a sincere if disastrously misjudged attempt to cultivate the innocence of rural life amidst the pomposity of court protocol. In 1789, it would seem an obscene parody for Marie Antoinette to be playing shepherdess and boiling fresh eggs for breakfast when scarecrow peasants begged on the roads'.</p> <p>Prince Charles has his own Hameau de la Reine: Duchy Home Farm, which provides the organic ingredients for his Duchy Originals range of produce. Like Marie Antoinette, he sees the poor as happiest when they have their place in a natural order, with royalty at its head. </p> <p>Last week, he surpassed the Bourbons. Marie Antoinette never said: 'Let them eat cake' to the poor of her day, but Prince Charles was adamant that today's poor should eat organic. Despite all I have read by him over the years, it was still a shock to listen to the recording of the interview he gave the Daily Telegraph. This raging man, who searched for apocalyptic predictions of catastrophe, was not a street preacher at Hyde Park Corner, but our next head of state. </p> <p>'Millions of small farmers all over the world are being driven off their land into unsustainable, unmanageable, degraded and dysfunctional conurbations of unmentionable awfulness,' he cried. Soon we will face 'the absolute destruction of everything'.</p> <p>Of everything, your highness? </p> <p>Yes, and another thing! If agribusinesses think they are going to prevent absolute destruction by using 'one form of clever genetic engineering after another', they will cause 'the biggest disaster environmentally of all time'.</p> <p>After that, Julie Burchill felt like sweet reason. In Not in my Name, her and Chas Newkey-Burden's spirited attack on modern hypocrisy, she declared: 'Green is the first sociopolitical movement in which every single leader and spokesperson is filthy rich - they make the Conservative party look like the Jarrow marchers.'</p> <p>With Lord Melchett, the Right Honourable Jonathon Porritt, George Monbiot and Zac Goldsmith, as well as Prince Charles, all holding prominent positions, the green movement is indeed where the concerned children of the upper class fled when the power of the House of Lords diminished. But Burchill and Newkey-Burden can't accept that just because the greenery appeals to the aristocracy does not mean it is always wrong. Global temperatures are still rising, even if old Etonians say they are. The danger comes not when greens support science but when they ignore it.</p> <p>Tellingly, Prince Charles has little to say about climate change, the one argument greens have won decisively. Instead, he prefers to concentrate his attacks on GM food with a Bourbon disregard for the consequences for the poor. It's too early to be sure, but can we now at least agree that there is a fair chance that Europe's panic about GM foods will be seen by historians as an explosion of irrationality as foolish as the manias about the MMR vaccine and millennium bug? </p> <p>The Royal Society investigated in 2003 and found GM foods posed no greater threat to human health than other foods. The society has just begun a second inquiry, but no one expects its scientists to alter their conclusions. True, some GM crops may damage the environment, but as the Royal Society points out, others could help it by requiring fewer dosings of pesticides.</p> <p>I suspect the society is wasting its time because rich Europeans will not be convinced by evidence. Their objections are not rational but visceral. GM foods offend Europe's cult of the authentic, which is as strong now as in Marie Antoinette's day. The wealthy propagandise for 'natural' childbirth, even though genuinely 'natural' childbirth for most women in the poor world is about the most dangerous experience of their lives. They dine on 'natural' ingredients, even though natural farming for the majority of peasant farmers is backbreaking drudgery. </p> <p>Europe's prejudices wouldn't matter if the world's population weren't shooting up, taking food prices with it. The only solutions are a global socialist revolution to redistribute wealth (unlikely) or farmers using new technologies to grow more food. Paul Collier, professor of economics at Oxford University, compares Brazil, where large agro-companies produce surpluses for the world market, with Africa, where aid policies have concentrated on keeping small peasant farms in business. </p> <p>'Unfortunately,' he sighed, 'large-scale commercial agriculture is unromantic. We laud the production style of the peasant: environmentally sustainable and human in scale. In respect of manufacturing and services, we grew out of this fantasy years ago, but in agriculture it continues to contaminate our policies.'</p> <p>Now suppose he and the Royal Society are wrong. There would still be something repellent about Prince Charles's behaviour. Constitutional propriety demands that he stays out of politics, yet he intervenes in a political debate on the side of those who want to limit food production at a time of growing hunger. He does not propose optional means of increasing supplies by, say, clearing forests to establish new organic farms. He does not even recognise that there is a need to increase supplies. </p> <p>I am not saying that he will share the fate of Marie Antoinette, merely that British republicans should take heart from his outbursts. The reign of Charles III will not be a happy one for the monarchy. He lacks the self-discipline to be king.</p>",
  "<h2>Victoria Coren is right: no one likes a busybody</h2> <p>As a magistrate, I started to read Victoria Coren's article ('There's no smoke without ire', 7 Days, last week) prepared to be outraged but I found her comments both brave and profound.</p> <p>It's strange how, as adults, we hate to be told what to do. I was in a queue the other day and a woman whispered in my ear that I was standing at the wrong end. This didn't bother me. I said thank you and moved. But had she said it loudly, I would have been devastated and would probably have walked off in embarrassment and rage; had there been a platform available, I don't think I would have pushed her off, but the air would have been blue inside my head. <br><strong>Patricia Sutton JP</strong><br>Coventry</p> <p>I was appalled by Victoria Coren's piece. As I understand it, Linda Buchanan asked two men to stop smoking on a station platform on Monday and Tuesday. On Wednesday morning, the same men made a rude sign to her as she walked past. Mrs Buchanan turned round and told them to grow up. They gave her a shove; she lost her balance and fell on to the track.</p> <p>This is not about the rights and wrongs of smoking on station platforms. It is about two thugs who did not like what Mrs Buchanan said to them so they hit her. They hit her so hard that they knocked her off the platform on to the track. Mrs Buchanan had a perfect right to tell these men off for making an obscene gesture. They had no right to hit her. For Coren to say that it served Mrs Buchanan right for being a busybody and a bully is outrageous. <br><strong>Joan Yeadon</strong><br>London N16</p> <h2>Ignor (sic) my words at your peril</h2> <p>Did any of your panellists bother to read my article in last week's Times Higher Education ('Does spelling matter?' Comment, last week), as opposed to commenting on the coverage of this in the media? Apart from Barbara Gunnell, I don't believe they did.</p> <p>Diane Abbott says that 'it is towering stupidity to suggest that we should spell any way we wish'. But who made this suggestion? Not me. All I said was that more variant spellings might be allowed. </p> <p>I am not proposing that we should ignore the 'e' in ignore (Anastasia de Waal), but I am proposing that 'ignor' might be accepted as a widely used variant spelling. This is not the same thing. </p> <p>Karol Sikora's comments - 'Spelling is the essential rule of written communication'; 'Try sending an email with only a single letter incorrect in the address' - are nothing more than a series of truisms.</p> <p>Do I think teaching spelling is 'a frivolous luxury'? No I don't, Professor Sikora. But I do think it is a good thing - good teaching in fact - to question how we teach spelling in schools and universities, especially when so many young people struggle with this.</p> <p>In all the huffing and puffing by the great and the good following the publication of my article, virtually no one has thought to ask the public what they think of my suggestion: not people who are well educated and can spell, but those who struggle with spelling. <br><strong>Dr Kenneth Smith</strong><br>London E2</p> <h2>Don't sleepwalk into global warming</h2> <p>I was sleepwalking.

If we all - government and individuals - put serious money into the new technologies, we could give our young people employment now, a focus for the future and, above all, hope.<br><strong>Pauline Fothergill</strong><br>West Berkshire</p> <h2>Alan Johnson, route to disaster</h2> <p>If Tony Woodley, joint leader of Unite, believes that the Labour government 'desperately needs to get back to its roots' ('Unions and MPs back \"dream ticket\"', News, last week), surely he cannot be looking to Alan Johnson to save the Labour Party? </p> <p>Johnson is the Secretary of State for Health who champions Foundation Hospitals. He was the Secretary of State for Education and Skills who adored undergraduate top-up fees. As Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, he upped the retirement age for private sector and future public-sector workers. As Employment Relations Minister, he told the Financial Times: 'The TUC left Planet Zog 20-odd years ago... but a few union leaders go back for the occasional day trip,' and in his time at the DTI he began the move to change the Post Office from a public service into a commercial business.</p> <p>Johnson is Blair reincarnate: a route to disaster, not the root of success.<br><strong>Jenny Fisher</strong><br>London E14</p> <h2>Simplify university application</h2> <p>Universities have rightly criticised a new system in which pupils who do unexpectedly well at A-level will be given five days after receiving their results to apply elsewhere ('Students to \"trade up\" for better college', last week). </p> <p>However, this confusing fudge has arisen as a direct result of the efforts of a significant number of universities to delay moves towards a system of post-qualification applications. Such a system would be far more simple and equitable than the present over-reliance on predicted grades.

In the 10 years I've been conducting research on energy in China, there has been a huge change in attitudes there. This is not just because the impacts of pollution have become so severe; it is also in China's economic self-interest to become less polluting. As the Chinese government argues, the energy-intensive mode of growth that has characterised China's rise is not sustainable.

  "<p>A London journalist was on holiday in Yorkshire one summer in the early 1890s when he heard talk of a mysterious painting in a nearby mansion. He got the address, walked the 12 miles there and persuaded the under-butler to let him in. Moments later, he was astonished to find himself all alone with Vel\u00e1zquez's Venus at her Mirror, better known as The Rokeby Venus</p> <p>She was hanging in a dingy hall but still the hack knew what he had, reporting that the hairs stood on his neck. On his return to London he rushed to the fine art library at the Victoria and Albert Museum to find out everything he could about the painter, wrote a passionate article about him - practically the first in the British press - and made the arduous pilgrimage to Madrid to see Las Meninas. Within a year, he had published a book on Vel\u00e1zquez and become one of the best art writers in the country. </p> <p>It sounds like a Victorian fable but it is a true romance and, what is more, an experience still to be had today. Not the newspaper scoop, perhaps - although only this year a lost Watteau was found by a sharp-eyed visitor in the proverbial corner of an English country house - but the thrill of the treasure hunt, if you know a work is there to be found, and the sudden revelation if you don't.</p> <p>For how many people actually expect to see the Rembrandt in a remote Welsh castle when it is so little reported? Who knows there are six times as many Zurbar\u00e1ns in a castle in County Durham as at the National Gallery in Trafalgar Square, unless they live close by? Our path to art is so rarely off the beaten track, channelled as it is through metropolitan museums.</p> <p>But it still possible to stumble upon a masterpiece in a stately home down some pheasant-filled drive. It is still possible to be completely alone with it in a Scottish castle, while everyone else is studying the silver-framed photographs of the last duke welcoming the Reagans. Above all, it is still possible to look at a great work of art in this way - without crowds, without explanatory labels or audio-guides - and for as long as you like: pretty much the ideal viewing conditions for art.</p> <p>And now is the ideal time to do the viewing, now that we can't afford to fly to the Prado and are staying at home this summer. We might be cash-poor but we are time-rich without international travel, and nothing frees the mind so much as having no particular place to go. I never got so much from a Bruegel in my life as the one in that Midlands mansion, Upton House, which I came across on a long, rainy holiday. A black-and-white vision of the last moments of the Virgin, her inner light illuminating the faces of the faithful in the midnight hour, it was hanging among some 17th-century chairs, ignored by the somnolent guards. Anyone could sit down, enter into Bruegel's scene and remain there uninterrupted for hours. </p> <p>Great art deserves time. Great art deserves a pilgrimage, but in Britain the journey may be conveniently short. You are rarely more than 50 odd miles from a masterpiece in these islands.</p> <h2>Artemisia Gentileschi, Self-Portrait as La Pittura, c 1638 <br>Hampton Court , London </h2> <p>Exhibit A in any history of women's art, this is not just the first female self-portrait to become famous, it is also unique among self-portraits in making such a drama of the labour involved. Gentileschi shows herself at an extreme angle, one arm raised to press the brush into the canvas, her body kiltered sideways . It is the hot moment of creation and Gentileschi looks like nobody else in art - or, rather, she looks like an artist of the distant future. She looks like an Action painter.</p> <p>\u00b7 This painting will be included in The Art of Italy exhibition at the Palace of Holyrood House, Edinburgh, 13 November-8 March</p> <h2>El Greco, The Disrobing of Christ, 1579 <br>Upton House, Warwicks </h2> <p>The paintings of El Greco are among the strangest in all art, with their cracking, flickering visions in acid colours, their warped and buckling space. To come across one in the Art Deco surroundings of Upton is especially startling. In this painting, once owned by Delacroix, the air clangs with threat. </p> <h2>Terry Frost, Green, Black and White Movement, 1951 <br>Tate St Ives, Cornwall </h2> <p>Frost was the great survivor of the St Ives movement, painting long after everyone else had died. His sharp, bright discs, lines and wedges are staunchly abstract but spark seascapes in the mind. This lyrical painting from 1951, before his palette turned primary, is a tilting wave of boats in the harbour. You hear what you see: the boats' nautical music.</p> <h2>Kurt Schwitters, Merzbarn wall, 1948 <br>Hatton Gallery, Newcastle </h2> <p>This is the only surviving relic of Schwitters's famous Merzbau series. The great German Dadaist was also Europe's pioneering installation artist, and the Merzbau were monumental collages using discarded objects: walls that were also landscapes of the mind. He only finished one wall of this, his last 'environment' before dying, but it has become a classic of modern art.</p> <h2>John Constable, Sky Study With a Shaft of Sunlight, 1822 <br>Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge </h2> <p>Constable is always better at six inches than six foot. This perfect little study in oil on paper conveys, in a few liquid sweeps, light drizzle, diaphanous cloud and sunshine about to break through above: English sky painting at its best and English weather in a nutshell.</p> <h2>James Turrell, Deer Shelter Skyspace, 2006<br> Yorkshire Sculpture Park </h2> <p>James Turrell, the great light and space artist, has found a stunningly simple way to frame the sky so that you see it in an entirely new light. Converting an 18th-century deer shelter on the Yorkshire hills into a miniature pantheon - a rotunda, with its dome open to the heavens - he turns the sky into an ever-changing image. It is so surprising that even children sit awed beneath this moving picture. It is Turrell's most exciting, yet contemplative, work.</p> <h2>Stanley Spencer, Sandham Memorial Chapel, 1927-32 <br>Burghclere, Hampshire </h2> <p>Inspired by Giotto's Arena Chapel in Padua, Spencer worked on these murals of the Great War for five years. He had signed up as a medical orderly but ended up seeing violent action in Macedonia, and this extraordinary cycle tells the story from bed-making in war hospitals to malarial battlefields.</p> <h2>George Stubbs, Hambletonian Rubbing Down, 1800 <br>Mount Stewart, Northern Ireland </h2> <p>The great racehorse Hambletonian is depicted lifesize, being rubbed down after his win at Newmarket in 1799, a race in which Stubbs felt the horse had been driven too hard. Stubbs was a stupendous anatomist and the anomalies are crucial: it takes two men to contain this magnificent beast, the house dwarfed between its powerful legs.</p> <h2>Sean Scully, Wall of Light Red Day Leaving, 2005 <br>Chatsworth, Derbyshire </h2> <p>Sean Scully makes great art out of modest stripes - vertical, horizontal, gridded, gently abutted in patchworks and mazes. A wall of glowing light, the blocks of deep crimson, orange, ochre and black summon the gradual sinking of the sun.</p> <h2>Paolo Uccello, The Hunt in the Forest, c 1470 <br>Ashmolean Museum, Oxford </h2> <p>Uccello is the mad master of perspective and this is one of the most brilliant examples of its use in Renaissance art. Everyone in the scene - huntsmen in full cry, hounds, horses, deer - is disappearing fast into the depths of the forest. A fence on the right zooms towards the vanishing point as if sucked into a vortex and darkness closes in. This was Uccello's last painting.</p> <h2>Naum Gabo, Linear Construction I, 1942 <br>Pier Arts Centre, Orkney </h2> <p>A highlight of this wonderful gallery in Stromness, Linear Construction No 1 really is a first. It was the first sculpture in which this Russian-born pioneer used nylon filaments to describe form and space, and it had a profound effect on a generation of British sculptors including Barbara Hepworth. Fragile and otherworldly, Linear Construction explores space without depicting mass.</p> <h2>Rembrandt, Catrina Hooghsaet, 1657<br> Penrhyn Castle, Bangor, Wales </h2> <p>Hooghsaet, one of Rembrandt's last patrons, was 50 when she sat for her portrait, the same age as the painter, and there is a sense of directness and equality to the image. A woman of conviction and eager intelligence, she appears vividly present, as if in mid-conversation.</p> <h2>Wyndham Lewis, One of the Stations of the Dead, 1933 <br>Aberdeen Art Gallery</h2> <p>The title and the image of a boat sailing a river through a cave immediately suggest Charon ferrying the souls of the dead into Hades. But the founder of Vorticism, Britain's only home-grown modernist movement, is not just representing myth. Lewis is painting a very modern Hades in 1933, somewhere between the underground and science fiction. </p> <h2>Francisco Zurbar\u00e1n, Levi, c1640<br>Auckland Castle, Bishop Auckland, Durham </h2> <p>The official residence of the Bishop of Durham, Auckland Castle is the unlikely repository of more Zurbar\u00e1ns than any other building in the world: 13 larger-than-life paintings of Jacob and his sons originally made to promote Catholicism in Mexico. The pictures were captured in transit by English pirates and eventually bought by Bishop Trevor in 1756. Zurbar\u00e1n is sometimes called Spain's Caravaggio, but his style is much more reserved and austere. The figures in this series are angular and dark, strange images of Old Testament mores.</p>",
  "<p>Not so very long ago, a woman was lying in bed with her husband and talking. Somehow she didn't notice that he was transcribing her monologue; he recognised the tragicomic potential of her stream of anxious thoughts.

What kind of loon was she?</p> <p>She was me, and I still have the transcript. </p> <p>My worries that evening covered the following topics: my hair (frizzy, split ends, more grey showing), whether the front door was locked, my eyes (possibility of an eye infection, which could preclude wearing contact lenses, which is to say: disaster), having flat feet (no good with flip-flops, so summer is effectively useless to me), was the front door really locked, the possibility of falling downstairs, my friend Sophie (why she hadn't returned my phone calls). Oh, and are you positive you locked the front door, or should I check?</p> <p>Worrying is something I've always excelled at. In this subject, I'm top of the class, straight As. But it's near impossible for me to get my friends to take my angst seriously. 'Your worries are frankly too ludicrous,' said my friend Eleanor when I called her to talk about this article. </p> <p>It's true. I accept many of my concerns seem unserious. And in public I make light of them, happily casting myself as a kind of female Woody Allen. But when I'm at home those ridiculous concerns can take over. </p> <p>I jump from one to the next without allowing myself a moment's rest. 'As soon as you finish one worry,' says my husband, 'which you usually insist is the worst you've ever had, you immediately start on another.' </p> <p>I'm not a flamboyant worrier; I don't have panic attacks, I don't wail or hyperventilate. Instead, I retreat into my own brain often for hours at a time, stuck either in the past, wishing that something that has happened hadn't (or vice versa), or in the future, overwhelmed by some monstrous circumstance that may never come to be. To my husband, this feels like I'm 'mentally absent'. It's exhausting living inside my head sometimes. It's a hideous waste of time and extremely annoying for those around me. </p> <p>In my last job, on a glossy magazine, the beauty editor encouraged me to have Botox not because I was looking older (though, now I think of it, I worry that this may have been what she was hinting at), but because I looked so anxious all the time. 'I think it'll really change the way people respond to you,' she said brightly. </p> <p>Did people truly think I looked worried? Now I was really worried. But I declined the Botox, because it would have done nothing to address the underlying problem. </p> <p>Anxiety is a bigger problem than this navel-gazing might suggest. Across a spectrum that includes panic attacks, obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress, phobias and the catch-all, generalised anxiety disorder - anxiety disorder has become the most prevalent mental health problem in the world, according to a World Mental Health Survey of 18 countries.</p> <p>And it's about to get worse. We are entering a new age of anxiety. As the economic situation worsens, so fretting in the general population rises. In the past year, oil prices have risen by 50 per cent, basic foods such as rice have soared by as much as 70 per cent and house prices are plummeting at a faster rate than we've seen in a long time. Those in the know are starting to whisper that we're heading for the mother of all recessions.</p> <p>Most people will take little comfort in the fact that the man in charge of all this, Prime Minister Gordon Brown, bites his fingernails. </p> <p>Merryn Somerset Webb, editor of MoneyWeek, has noticed clear signs of anxiety among her readers. 'People are anxious, and they are right to be. They're worrying about investments and pensions, the effect of inflation on their future, about which banks are safe and which might go bust. We have had letters from people who have lost a lot of money on the property market. People under 40 are not used to losing jobs or being made redundant. We are not used to property prices falling or not having what we want. As adults we haven't suffered hardship. I do think a lot of people are in for a big shock.' </p> <p>Economists tell us that what happens in the US will happen to us nine months later. Well, in June it emerged that the American middle classes are losing their homes and finding themselves obliged to live instead in their cars, in specially designated parking lots.</p> <p>City health clinics have reported a huge rise in calls from professionals facing redundancy. A helpline used by London's major banks and financial firms received 3,500 calls in June from people with anxiety and depression - a 10 per cent rise on last year. Project director James Slater says: 'People are worried about redundancies and a potential recession, which adds to people's anxiety, can tip them over the edge.'</p> <p>Don Serratt, a former merchant banker and founder of the Life Works community rehab clinic, has seen a 20 per cent rise since last November in admissions related to economic anxiety. 'We are getting more and more calls from people not just in the City but professionals from all over. Things are bad right now.'</p> <p>Dr Richard Bowskill, consultant psychiatrist at the Priory, is more specific: 'For a while, we have seen people worrying about mortgages and the cost of living. But now we have started to see people worrying about job security. That has a knock-on effect. It leads to people pushing themselves at work. I saw someone this morning who said they couldn't take any more time off work because they felt under scrutiny.</p> <p>'The mind is just another part of the body,' Bowskill explains. 'It's an organ that normally functions well but, if put under too much strain, it starts not functioning properly. The physical symptoms are things like palpitations, stomach churning and sleep disturbance.'</p> <p>Fretting and hand-wringing represent a considerable drain on our time and energy. 'People who worry a lot are generally less effective than those who don't; they get less work done and are often less happy,' says Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at New York University. In experimental tasks, worriers are slower to respond than non-worriers, presumably because worrying burns off mental energy that would be more effectively applied elsewhere. 'Worry, it has been said, is often like a rocking chair: it gives you something to do, but it doesn't necessarily get you anywhere. Evolution may have given us the opportunity to worry, but that doesn't mean we should take the bait.'</p> <p>Indeed, constant worry has a clear and scientifically proven link to ill health. Chronic worriers, for example, are more likely than others to suffer from heart conditions. The connection between worry and poor health can also take a less predictable form. Two years ago, I convinced myself I had an eye infection. So I took myself to Moorfields Eye Hospital for checks. It turned out that my eye was perfectly healthy, but sitting in the casualty department among genuine patients, their eyes weeping pus, I picked up an extremely serious viral conjunctivitis that lasted three months and threatened to compromise my sight forever. The lesson: hypochondria really gave me something to worry about. </p> <p>But it seems I've not got it as bad as many others. In the course of researching this story, I bought (and immediately hid inside my bag) a book called Overcoming Anxiety for Dummies. My husband flicked through it before me, and announced with some satisfaction that I didn't seem to have such a bad case after all. For instance I have never felt, like one poor unfortunate in the book, that I was actually going to die during a panic attack.</p> <p>Anxiety, says psychologist Oliver James, is worrying about things you can't do anything about, or which don't matter. It's not the same as fear: fear sharpens the senses, anxiety paralyses them. 'The key thing,' James tells me, 'is that anxiety is irrational. It's a loss of priority - a lost sense of what is <br>important and what isn't.' </p> <p>In my own case, though I am concerned about the environment and the ongoing economic downturn, these are not the things that get me in a funk. I am much less likely to wake in the night in a panic about rising sea levels, or rising fuel bills, than about having a bad haircut. </p> <p>Another way to look at anxiety is as a chemically induced response to threat: the hormone cortisol is secreted, in turn leading to an excess of adrenaline. You go into the fight or the flight mode. 'If your cortisol levels are permanently jammed on high,' explains James, 'you are going to feel permanently under threat. You become indiscriminate about what constitutes a threat. You go to the kitchen to make a cup of tea and worry about running out of tea bags. You become irritable, you swear, you burst into tears. You have very extreme reactions relative to the significance.'</p> <p>The Michelin-starred chef Tom Aikens knows a bit about this. He's well known for an alleged incident with a palette knife that got him fired from his first restaurant. In recent years, he says, he has calmed down a lot thanks to therapy and regular exercise, but at the time - a decade ago - he was 'wound up, stressed', and liable to get upset about silly things. 'I used to bottle everything up and then explode, go off on one. It was always about the little details, because it's the little details that make food special. I would be so stupid. I would be so stressed by an overcooked piece of meat. What's the point? Just put another one on.'</p> <p>According to James, a person's cortisol levels are pretty much set in the first six years of life. If he's right, I can't imagine what might have set my own levels high. I did, years ago, visit a Freudian therapist who gave me a box of hankies and encouraged me to churn up what seemed even to me to be rather petty resentments from the distant past. Rightly or wrongly, I found this approach unhelpful and didn't return. Much more helpful were sessions, a few years later, with a cognitive therapist - who tried to address the way I look at the world and respond to events - though, as must already be clear, she didn't eliminate my problems over the long term.</p> <p>Rather than look back, what matters is whether I am likely to pass on my worrying tendencies to my daughter, now four years old. Although sunny, confident and happy, she has already started registering dissatisfaction with her hair (she has fabulous blonde curls) perhaps because she's witnessed too many of my frizzy-hair freak-outs. I caught her the other day staring into the mirror and stretching out one of her glorious ringlets. Is she destined to be a worrier? Can I stop that? Or will everything I do make it more likely? </p> <p>There's no doubt I've become more anxious since becoming a mother. My fear of falling down stairs only started after my daughter was born; I tortured myself with thoughts of slipping while carrying my precious bundle. My hypochondria also intensified, and I became scared of swimming in the sea (I put these down to the post-natal realisation that another human really depends on me to remain alive, and healthy). </p> <p>But these protective concerns can themselves produce negative effects. In spring last year, after Madeleine McCann disappeared, I became deeply anxious about my daughter's safety and let her come into our bed at night. I liked having her next to me, just to hear her breathing, and knowing she was all right. The result: she developed a fear of sleeping in her own room and it took us most of the autumn to coax her back into her own bed. </p> <p>The American author and academic Katie Roiphe recognises high levels of anxiety in herself and believes that passing it on to Violet, her six-year-old daughter, is inevitable. 'I think it's impossible not to pass along that temperament,' she says. 'When I was a child I was afraid of the wind - even when I was six months old, I was that afraid of the universe. It's impossible that I should get a calm child. I look at some children who are unflappable and think that would be nice for my daughter, but I don't think it's going to happen. My daughter worries about a million things: that if she is going to drink from someone else's straw she will turn into that person. She has supernatural worries.' </p> <p>But can anxiety really be explained entirely by the influence of neurotic parents, or high levels of cortisol laid down in childhood? The sudden, recent increase in anxiety among adults stressing about climate change and economic collapse suggests not. Could it be caused by consumerism, which we grow into more slowly?</p> <p>It could, says Tom Hodgkinson, editor of The Idler and author of the inspirational How to Be Free. He believes that our economic system functions precisely by keeping us anxious. We're encouraged to believe, at all times, that we're just one purchase away from happiness: 'Anxious people make good consumers and good workers. Anxiety will drive us back into our comfort blankets of credit-card shopping and bad food - the system deliberately produces anxiety while simultaneously promising to take it away.' </p> <p>The writer and professional worrier William Leith agrees. He breaks off from writing a new book, Bits of Me are Falling Apart, to elaborate: 'Gordon Brown is always telling us that our economy has to grow, otherwise we will fall apart. What does that mean? It means that everyone has to make you buy stuff all the time. And the way they do this is by constantly advertising. Advertising is about making you feel anxious: you're too fat, or you need a new kitchen. We live in a world where you can be playing golf and, on finally putting the ball, you find inside the hole an ad for a car. You walk away thinking, \"I should buy a Lexus.\"'</p> <p>Oliver James makes a similar case in his book Affluenza. And if we're anxious in the good times, economic downturn will be so much worse. Since the advent of the credit crunch, he argues, significant numbers of people will have been 'shitting themselves'. Their cortisol levels, he contends, will be through the ceiling. 'They will be worrying themselves silly and will become physically ill. They might start showing OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder) symptoms, trying to create something safe out of this very dangerous situation. They might think: \"If I say 100 Hail Marys before leaving the house at least there is something I can do.\"'</p> <p>If that's what they're doing, I can sympathise. At times of particular stress (or, as my husband would tell you, every night), I find myself compelled to check the front door several times. I also have a little routine for checking the cooker is turned off. I blame my husband for this: he has occasionally forgotten to turn off the gas, and if he's cavalier about the cooker then how can I be sure about the front door? But I daresay that James would point to other, deeper reasons for my obsessive checking.</p> <p>Leith believes that obsessive compulsive behaviour masks deeper anxieties. 'If I am worried about a big thing like, \"I'm a complete failure, half my life has gone and I'm going to be dead soon\", the incidental worries get worse. If I'm sitting at my desk to start writing, I might think, \"Oh, God, I can't write, I just can't do it, I just can't do it. Oh, God.\" At those times, I might need to check the cooker in case the house is burning down.'</p> <p>Despite holding consumerism responsible, James believes that therapy can help. He particularly recommends something called the Hoffman Process, which he himself has undergone. But this seems to involve whacking cushions and pretending they are your parents, and to me it sounds horribly like the Freudian analyst I saw years ago - but worse, and more expensive. </p> <p>Hodgkinson, more appealingly, encourages us to take matters into our own hands and simply shed the burden - 'the dreadful, gnawing, stomach-churning sense that things are awry, mixed with a chronic sense of powerlessness ... forever hoping, fearing or regretting'. </p> <p>In How to Be Free, Hodgkinson sets out a comprehensive list of methods to encompass this liberation. These include gardening, ceasing to read newspapers or watch telly, and embracing a fatalistic theology. 'Catholics are probably less anxious than Protestants,' Hodgkinson argues. 'Buddhists are certainly less anxious than Jews.'</p> <p>My husband has similar ideas. He frequently urges me to read the works of Thich Nhat Hanh, a Vietnamese Buddhist monk and best-selling self-help master. Once in a while, I give it a go. The general thrust seems to be that we should learn to live in the moment, by for instance concentrating on our breath. 'Mindful breathing helps us stop being preoccupied by sorrows of the past and anxieties of the future,' Nhat Hanh writes in one book. 'It helps us be in touch with life in the present moment.'</p> <p>But worry creeps up on us even when we're counting our breaths and living in the moment. It's Leith, typically downbeat, who points this out to me. It happens, for instance, when he's negotiating pedestrian crossings with his three-year-old son: 'Before you cross,' he says, 'you wait for the green man. But what if there's no traffic coming? Should I stick to my guns and wait? Or should I cross the road? If so, surely he will realise that this is an exception? But then again, I want him to understand it has to turn green before he even thinks of crossing. I don't want him to think there's an either/or. Am I being over-anxious? There may be an appropriate level of anxiety, but no one knows what it is.'</p>",
  "<p>The internet is still very young. It was only November 1977 when a group of computer scientists successfully connected three networks around the world, including one at University College London. It took until 1989 for the internet to become commercially available and about another decade after that for it to achieve widespread household use in Europe and the United States. Only then did we emerge from what I think of as the 'internet comma' days, when its mention in the media was always followed by a comma and a short description.</p> <p>From there, we've got to the point where I, because of my long history with the technology, now run afoul of The Observer style guide. I remain convinced that as a unique entity the word requires capitalisation. You'll see that the newspaper is so comfortable with the term that it doesn't. </p> <p>This reflects that in a very short time the internet has had a profound impact on the way we live, so it's hardly surprising that some people have expressed scepticism of its effects. Writing in Atlantic magazine, for example, Nicholas Carr recently asked whether Google is making us stupider, while Doris Lessing's Nobel lecture last December included what many saw as an attack on the internet.</p> <p>Yet such a transformative technology is bound to ruffle a few feathers. I have no doubts that its social repercussions will take decades to be fully understood, but it has already done much to benefit the world. It has provided access to information on a scale never before imaginable, lowered the barriers to creative expression, challenged old business models and enabled new ones. It has succeeded because we designed it to be both flexible and open. These features have allowed it to accommodate innovation without massive changes to its infrastructure. </p> <p>And innovation on the internet happens at a rapid pace. Ten years ago, Google was simply an idea being explored by two graduates in California. The years to come will offer more that is new and exciting. It's easy to forget, sitting in the UK or the US, just how far the internet still has to go. Today, there are only about 1.4 billion users, representing a bit more than one-fifth of the world's population, and a substantial amount of the content on the web is still written in English. But the internet is becoming more global. Asia has more than 500 million users and Europe nearly 400 million and internet-enabled mobile phones will help extend the net to Africa, Latin America and the Indian subcontinent. We're about to see further waves of innovation.</p> <p>There are more than three billion mobiles in use today and more than 80 per cent of the world's population live within range of a network. In areas where wireline or WiFi access barely exists, many new users will first experience the internet through a mobile phone. In developing economies, people are already finding innovative ways to use mobile technology. Grameen's micro-finance and village phone programmes in Bangladesh and elsewhere are known and respected around the world, but there are many less famous examples. During the Kenyan elections, Mobile Planet provided its subscribers with up-to-the-minute results by text message. As the cost of mobile technologies fall, the opportunities for such innovation will continue to grow.</p> <p>We're nearing the tipping point for mobile computing to deliver timely, geographically and socially relevant information. Researchers in Japan recently proposed using data from vehicles' windscreen wipers and embedded GPS receivers to track the movement of weather systems through towns and cities with a precision never before possible. It may seem academic, but understanding the way severe weather, such as a typhoon, moves through a city could save lives. Further exploration can shed light on demographic, intellectual and epidemiological phenomena, to name just a few areas.</p> <p>It's amazing how quickly those of us with internet access have come to take for granted the remarkable amounts of information we have at our disposal, but we're only seeing the beginnings. The bulk of human knowledge remains offline. As more of us get access to the internet, more of the world's information will find its way online.</p> <p>The web is already making strides toward becoming truly global. While I was chairman of ICANN, one of the organisations that helps ensure that the internet works uniformly around the world, we adopted rules to allow the system of domain names to accommodate non-Roman characters, making the web more accessible to people whose languages use other scripts, such as Arabic, Korean or Cyrillic.</p> <p>There are improvements in automatic language translation tools and, in particular, the field that we call machine learning. It is already possible to do a Google search and explore the results in English across web content in 23 different languages, from Czech to Hindi to Korean. Speakers of any of those languages can now explore content on the web written in any of the others. </p> <p>The technology isn't perfect yet, but it's rapidly improving. Even in its present form, it's easy to imagine a not-too-distant future in which automatic translation will allow two people in the world to message one another in real time, each experiencing the chat in his or her tongue. Just imagine what a significant step that will be. </p> <p>The technological progress of the internet has set huge social changes in motion. As with other transformative innovations before it, from the telegraph to television, people will continue to worry about the effects; the printing press and the rise in literacy that it effected were long seen as destabilising forces. Similar concerns about the internet are being raised, but if we take a long view, its benefits far outweigh the discomforts of learning to integrate it into our lives. </p> <p>After working on the internet for more than three decades, I'm more optimistic about its promise than ever. It has the potential to change unexpected parts of our lives: from surfboards that let you surf the web while you wait for the next wave to refrigerators that can email you suggested recipes based on the food you already have.</p> <p>My colleagues at Nasa and I are even working on an interplanetary internet, which will make getting information to and from spacecraft in the far reaches of the solar system more reliable. </p> <p>Closer to home, we're at the cusp of a truly global internet that will bring people closer together and democratise access to information. We are all free to innovate on the net every day and we should look forward to more people around the world enjoying that freedom.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Vint Cerf, a vice president of Google, co-designed the architecture of the internet</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Catherine Bennett is away</p>",
  "<p>'But that's a dreadful name,' spluttered my mother when I announced we had decided to call her new granddaughter Agnes.</p> <p>'Aggie is terrible too,' my father weighed in.</p> <p>'Like that woman from How Clean Is Your House? where they show people who live like dirty pigs how to tidy up their homes,' my sister added.</p> <p>These were strong reactions, but not unexpected. Research by Dr Geoff Ellis, a statistician formerly of Sheffield Hallam University, showed old-style girls' names have fallen out of fashion. Edna, Olive and Agnes have almost completely disappeared from birth register.</p> <p>In 2005, the last year for which full records are available, just 34 girls were registered as Agnes, compared with 1,522 in 1907. As is becoming increasingly apparent to me now, it is a name people either love or hate. To the older members of my family, it evokes images of ageing aunts sporting wispy beards and smelling of Parma violets. For others of my generation, it is back in vogue, seen as a classic, stylish name in the same band as Iris, Edie and Martha, which are regaining popularity. Then there's Agyness Deyn, the latest supermodel, who has given the name a certain cachet by adopting it over her unmemorable birth name, Laura.</p> <p>When I texted news to friends of my second daughter's arrival last Tuesday evening, one replied: 'Gorgeous name, definitely going to be a Virago author.' Another wrote: 'Sounds like a 1950s Hollywood star.' With such a personal choice, there'll always be many who won't like your decision. You can tell as much from people's lack of comment as from forthright verdicts such as my mother's (who's just plain Jane, by the way). It is how the name sounds and looks to you that is important, but you also hope you haven't cursed your child with a name they will loathe. We chose Agnes because it is a strong name, uncommon yet not outlandish. Not only does it go well with my short married surname - Lea - it also complements Child A, who is called Beatrix.</p> <p>I like many traditional names, though some I find ugly - Edna, Ethel, Gertrude. But Apple, Brooklyn, Pixie? They really are dreadful. <br><strong>Lucy Rock</strong></p> <h2>It could have been a little worse - I was very nearly a Napoleon</h2> <p>I was lucky to be named Norman. The other options, I was told years later, were Nelson and Napoleon.</p> <p>Having agreed that the name was to begin with N, my parents split along patriot lines and a frisson passed over my infant cot. Dad, born within sound of Bow Bells, wanted the hero of Trafalgar for his son and heir.</p> <p>My Parisienne mother, who could not pass Nelson's Column on a bus without a mou\u00e9 of regret, held out for the lion of France. Words were exchanged. The registrar of births had to wait while they sorted it out. Norman was the compromise.</p> <p>It was not a comfortable name to grow up with. Norman Wisdom was all the rage at the local Odeon, a rubber-legged comedian who could not scratch his ear without collapsing in a heap. 'Norman Wisdom' is what gym teachers barked in my direction if I failed a long jump or missed an open goal on a muddy field. History was a lot better. I came top in the Norman Conquest.</p> <p>Someone called Sue Thompson singing 'Norman ooh, ooh, ooh, Norman' (words and music: John D Loudermilk, curse his Nashville socks) was a blight on my early teens, but I soon realised there were not that many of us about and, for quite a few girls, if I played my cards right, I was going to be their first Norman, if not their only one. </p> <p>Nor, I found, was there more competition in public life. There was Mailer, the beat-up novelist; Podhoretz, a pre-neocon polemicist; the shower slasher in Hitchcock's Psycho; and Jessye, a statuesque soprano. Thatcher had two specimens in her cabinet - Tebbit and Fowler - and when the UN liberated Kuwait, there at the head of the first Iraq invasion was 'Stormin' Norman' Schwarzkopf, a rubicund general of no obvious similarity to my thoughtful self. </p> <p>In the lily pond of arts criticism, I got dubbed Stormin' whenever one of my invectives offended an establishment grandee. The adjective was supposed to put me down as a bit of a ranter but, truth to tell, I never felt the barb. </p> <p>You see, I'm not really a Norman, whatever the byline says. The name was only ever a piece of parental improvisation, something to put on my passport and end a domestic tiff. I've never been called Norman at home. </p> <p>I keep two different names, one personal, the other professional, allowing me to maintain a healthy detachment from whatever success or failure comes my way in the public domain. Norman contains little of me and I feel no sorrow to see it going the way of the Elkans and Wilfreds and Jephthahs that were popular in Victorian times and fill up the fascias of First World War cenotaphs. Norman is going the way of Irene, Hilda and Clara, names that began with Auntie when I was growing up and have long since vanished from circulation.</p> <p>A report last week found that only two babies in Britain were christened Norman during 2007, placing my name as an endangered species alongside Gertrude (no loss) and a flock of butterflies that have fled our gardens as the summers turn wet and turbulent in the grip of global warming. I shall miss the red admirals and high brown fritillaries more than I will the name I bear, for they, once extinct, can never be revived, while Norman can make a comeback at any moment. </p> <p>All it will take is for one overnight celebrity, one failed contestant of a TV talent contest, to name its next child after the Conquest and Norman will become hot again as Ryan fades and Kylie goes the way of all ephemerality. It is too soon to write Norman off.<br><strong>Norman Lebrecht</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Norman Lebrecht's latest book, Maestros, Masterpieces and Madness, is out now, Penguin</p>",
  "<p>Restaurant kitchens are amazing,' says Norman Cook, hovering hungrily over a slab of raw tuna. 'They all have an air of mad panic. I get my kicks pretending to help, watching everyone rush around, crazy. It's like being inside a film.' </p> <p>Cook, 44, best known as DJ Fatboy Slim, has a stake in New York gastropub the Spotted Pig, and earlier this year relaunched Japanese restaurant Okinami, in the centre of Brighton, overlooking the Royal Pavilion. 'I used to do the odd shift at the Spotted Pig - it was one of the perks of being an investor - but since they got their Michelin star I'm not allowed in the kitchen. Once, in Brighton, Okinami got really busy, so I was thrown in to help. I badly burned my hands, which isn't a good idea when you have to DJ that night.'</p> <p>First inspired to make music after seeing Donny Osmond on TV, Cook (real name Quentin) has climbed through the charts, first in the Housemartins in the 1980s, then Beats International, and Freakpower, before finding stardom (and love, with wife Zo\u00eb Ball) as Fatboy Slim. As well as his split of the restaurants, he also owns a share of Brighton and Hove Albion football club. 'I've certainly learnt some life lessons through all my ventures,' he sighs. 'I've learnt that everything costs four times as much and takes three times as long as you think it will.'</p> <p>Cook, who lists his passions as 'music, women, football and food, in that order, obviously', learnt to cook when his son, Woody, now seven, was born. 'When I first started,' he says, 'I'd ring up Jamie Oliver in Australia asking, \"exactly how much is a glug of oil?\" He really got me going. He made me believe I could do it.' </p> <p>Okinami's chef, Mike Dodd, gazes fondly at Cook. 'He's a much respected icon in Brighton, and he's not like your usual celebrity,' Dodd gushes. 'I mean, I've had Noel Gallagher swearing his face off in the restaurant, and I put him in his place. He came in with an entourage, asking \"Where are the f-ing chips?\" I said, \"In the f-ing kebab shop, mate\". He came back sheepishly the next night and had a nice, quiet meal, and it was all OK.' </p> <p>Cook's tried the whole menu ('my favourite dish is the scallops with garlic butter and wasabi mayonnaise'), so he's moving along to cocktails. Dodd enthuses about their Japanese mojitos and cherry blossom margaritas, with rose tequila and sake. He is in charge of the kitchen, cutting tuna to make it look like crashing waves. </p> <p>Cook though, is in charge of the music. 'Well, it's the only thing I'm qualified to do,' he smiles. 'I made a whole album of ambient, fairly chilled stuff to play while people are eating - I never released it, just did it for fun - but I love it.

  "<p>Lawrence Booth is a Guardian cricket journalist who helped pioneer a new art form, called the OBO. This means over-by-over coverage of a cricket match and it appears on the internet. But the writer doesn't go to the ground: he (or she) watches TV in the office, with the sound up so he can include the banalities, idiocies and rare witticisms of the commentators, plus selected readers' comments, emailed in. The result, as Booth puts it, 'is a weird but captivating mixture of reporting and wackiness', and a boon to cricket addicts tied to their office desks without TV or radio. This engaging book, which can't be called autobiography, history, analysis or memoir, is best categorised as an elaborated version of the OBO, 'a cricket book with a difference ... full of stories, observations, jokes and whimsy', as the publishers rather desperately put it.</p> <p>It's not actually all that different. The style is within the mainstream tradition of English cricket books. Other countries take the game seriously, which probably explains why they usually win. I have by my desk The Development of West Indies Cricket, Vol I: The Age of Nationalism, published by the University of West Indies Press. It assures me that 'dialectical analysis best explains the dichotomous development of the social culture of West Indies cricket'. Being a lefty, I don't doubt it, but it's a long way from the late Brian Johnston collapsing into giggles when anybody mentioned a batsman getting his leg over. The authentic tone of English cricket writing was established by Dickens's description of Dingley Dell v All Muggleton in The Pickwick Papers, where, when 'a slim gentleman' tried to catch the ball, 'it struck him on the nose, and bounded pleasantly off with redoubled violence'. In this spirit, Booth intersperses anecdotes about international cricketers with accounts of his own mediocrity as a performer.</p> <p>In no other game, and no other country, is amiable incompetence so celebrated. English cricket is culturally embarrassed by victory and the single-mindedness that goes with it. This explains why the team that won the Ashes in 2005, apparently young enough to promise at least five years of world domination, has failed since then to win anything worthwhile (beating New Zealand and, these days, West Indies doesn't count). In most countries, players enter the Test team and, with experience, get better. In England, they get worse, or suffer career-threatening injuries, mental and physical. Even when England recruit players who were born and coached overseas - which seems about half the team nowadays - they eventually turn out as hopeless as the others. Think Graeme Hick, the Zimbabwean who looked like a modern Bradman before he put on an England cap. The South African Kevin Pietersen, recently appointed England captain, looks an exception, but give him time.</p> <p>Why this chronic under-achievement? You can say the English attitude to cricket echoes the national attitude to all sports. We're not much good either at football, rugby or tennis. It's partly explained by AA Gill, as quoted by Booth: 'The English teeter on the edge of not being able to take anything seriously.' It's partly the peculiar English belief that nurturing sport among the young is something schools, not clubs, should do, along with everything else from preventing teenage pregnancies to saving the environment. It's partly our redtop press, which is so faithful to the ancient Greek dramatists' concept of hubris that it soon topples all heroes from their pedestals.</p> <p>But two things are peculiar to cricket. First, there's county cricket, long the only full-time domestic professional circuit in the world and one that's hopelessly uncompetitive. True, it now has two divisions with promotion and relegation, but nobody takes that very seriously. The county game involves groups of young men ambling around the country for five months every summer, day in, day out. It's a wonderful life, delightfully described in several books by Stephen Chalke. The trick is to do just well enough to keep your place, without doing so well you upset your mates. Booth recalls how Bobby Simpson, a former Australian captain, was ousted as Leicestershire coach because, as one player said, 'he wanted us all to be Test cricketers'. Perish the thought. Those who make the Test team carry the mindset. Is it any wonder that English batsmen, having scored 100, usually get out? Or that bowlers, having got a wicket, fire the next three balls down leg side?</p> <p>Second, the majority of other cricket-playing nations are former colonies. While the English, consumed by post-colonial guilt, became more embarrassed about beating them, they became more assertive and confident. As Booth says, our rivals are young countries, and cricket has played a role in their development and identity for most, if not all, of their histories. For us, even the Ashes 'represents a drop in the chronological ocean'. Come to think of it, this probably also explains why Brazil, Argentina, Germany and Italy - all relatively youthful nation-states - are better at football.</p> <p>And why, you may ask, are cricket nuts like Booth and myself always coming up with theories like that? Because, you see, each game lasts a long time, and often there's nothing much happening, and sometimes they don't play at all because it's raining or it's teatime, and so the game lends itself to the free association of ideas, dialectic and all. That's the delight of cricket, and the delight also of this book.</p>",
  "<p>Avenue Gardens, a cul-de-sac in Richmond, west London, is an odd place for an insurrection. Indeed, the assortment of working parents, kids and the odd pensioner who crowded into the sitting room at Number 16 on a summer evening seemed an unlikely band of insurgents.</p> <p>'But we are angry,' said Julia Bates, co-chair of a year-long campaign to prevent a new housing development from swallowing up a tree-fringed patch of grassland across the street. 'We've been fighting this since last summer. And it looked like we had won a few months ago, after the developers withdrew the plan. Now they're back,' she sighed, before adding with a confident smile: 'But so are we.'</p> <p>Meanwhile, more than 200 miles north, Elaine Spurr gazed despondently from the terrace of her family home in the Lancashire village of Clayton-le-Woods across an acre of lawn and recently felled trees. Soon it would be the site of five new houses and two bungalows, with an additional 19 houses set to be built on a series of back gardens sold by homeowners on the next road. </p> <p>With a petition signed by nearly 200 neighbours, Spurr and her husband, Ian, also thought they had outflanked the developer, after the local council in Chorley ruled in their favour. But now a planning inspector has overturned the decision. </p> <p>To opponents of these and hundreds of similar schemes across the country, the growing encroachment by new housing developments on islands of greenery in Britain's towns and cities has become known as 'garden grabbing'.</p> <p>Local grumbles have been dismissed by one architect involved in the Avenue Gardens development as: 'The classic Nimby response - not in my backyard.' But the accelerating pace of such projects has prompted increasingly vocal opposition and confronted local and national government with a potentially incendiary political challenge.</p> <p>Boris Johnson, the London mayor, made 'garden grabbing' an issue in his campaign against Ken Livingstone. At one meeting, on a threatened communal lawn a few streets away from Avenue Gardens, he accused his predecessor of having ignored the issue. 'We have lost garden space 22 times the size of Hyde Park - roughly the size of Hammersmith and Fulham and Islington combined,' he claimed, pledging to write a 'presumption' of retaining green spaces into the city's development plan.</p> <p>Some of the losses are down to residents paving over front gardens to cope with another urban shortage - parking spaces. That issue has prompted environmental campaigners to warn of serious drainage problems that could exacerbate flood damage. The government has responded with new rules that will require planning permission if permeable materials are not used.</p> <p>But the galloping increase in back-garden grabs was made clear in a written parliamentary answer to the Tories' shadow Cabinet Office minister, Greg Clark. It revealed that about a third of new homes in the London area were being built on former residential gardens - a figure that has doubled from an average of only 15 per cent during Labour's first eight years in office.</p> <p>At the heart of an escalating battle over the fate of back gardens across Britain lies a wider planning conundrum raised by one of Gordon Brown's core policy commitments as Prime Minister. Weeks after taking over from Tony Blair, he announced Britain's largest home-building programme in decades, promising to bring three million new properties on to the market by 2020. </p> <p>Since the 1970s, there has been a 30 per cent increase in the number of households and ministers fear that unless more land is made available few young couples or families will be able to own their own home. 'There is an overwhelming case for building more housing,' a spokesman for the Department of Communities and Local Government said, dismissing suggestions that economic storm clouds would mean a retreat from Brown's target. 'We must remain as ambitious as possible,' he said. 'We recognise market conditions are currently difficult, but the need to deliver more homes remains just as much a priority as it was before the credit crunch.' The problem is, where? </p> <p>The Prime Minister, in unveiling his housing plans, said that the priority would be to build on 'brownfield' sites. That is where the 'garden grab' battle has erupted. For while the generally understood definition of brownfield was former factories and other disused or derelict sites, under planning definitions codified in 2000 residential back gardens also qualify.</p> <p>A constellation of David Cameron's rising stars - including Johnson, Clark, Michael Gove, shadow secretary of state for children, schools and families, and Zac Goldsmith, the party's prospective candidate for Richmond - have been campaigning to make garden grabbing a national issue. Labour has accused the Tories of opportunism and of ignoring the urgent need for new housing. Yet when Clark introduced a private member's bill to protect back gardens, he was backed by dozens of Labour MPs.</p> <p>Goldsmith is about to unveil a website to galvanise opposition. He is also planning a referendum in Richmond this autumn over 'intensive development' plans for housing in the borough. 'A referendum isn't legally binding,' he conceded. 'But this is about local people speaking up for their own communities, their environment and their basic quality of life.'</p> <p>In Clayton-le-Woods, Elaine Spurr explained with a mix of bitterness and resignation how she and her husband had spent months trying - and failing - to do just that. When she, her husband and their three children began house-hunting nearly a decade ago, they 'fell in love' with Kirkby Avenue, one of a network of small, winding residential roads set back from the older homes on the neighbourhood's main thoroughfare, Lancaster Lane. The main attraction was the view from the back - an uninterrupted expanse of back gardens, fringed by apple trees.</p> <p>Now their view will be 'the solid walls of three homes', she said as she spread out the plans by local developer Wainhomes. She realised 'how horrible this whole business is' when their youngest child, 11-year-old Sarah, was looking out on the gardens from her bedroom. 'She turned to me and said, \"Mummy, can I please have some nice blinds for my window?\" '</p> <p>For months, the Spurrs and dozens of their neighbours pressed Chorley council to veto a development they said would spoil their view and choke local roads, adding delays and potential dangers to the journey to school. It would, they said, change the character of the area. The council finally agreed. But the developers appealed and won.</p> <p>The Spurrs' next-door neighbour, Bob Swarbrick, a softly spoken man who has lived in the area for more than 30 years, said that the battle to save 'our little bit of countryside' had left him feeling sympathy for all sides. 'I was part of the campaign,' he said. 'Now I guess I'm neutral.</p> <p>'To be honest,' he adds, 'if I lived on Lancaster Lane and had a big garden, sooner or later I would have been tempted to do something with it. I'm sorry it's happening, but I think in the end it was probably inevitable.'</p> <p>Inevitable, Elaine Spurr now agrees, but still 'wrong'. A few miles away a new town called Buckshaw Village has gone up in the past few years. It has shops, parkland, a playing field and plans for a new primary school. The largest 'brownfield regeneration' development in Europe, it is on the site of the former Royal Ordnance Factory. 'Why squeeze all these houses into the gardens at the heart of our neighbourhood when there are more than enough properties available there?' she protested. The answer came from Peter Barlow, land and planning director at Wainhomes. Even before the recent credit crunch, he said, Buckhurst Village sales had slowed to a crawl, despite the fact it is perfectly placed for motorway access to Manchester and Leeds. 'Not everyone wants to live in a new town. There will always be demand for the kind of family homes we're building in areas like Lancaster Lane. That's just the reality.'</p> <p>Barlow said he fully understood why families such as the Spurrs were distressed. As a developer, he gets no pleasure from prompting an 11-year-old to plead for blinds on her bedroom window. 'It would be easier to build on greenfield away from a built-up area,' he said. 'But we build where the planning rules say we can.'</p> <p>Until recently, he added, the local council had opposed new housing. But the Prime Minister was right to say that there was huge pent-up demand for homes - not only in London and the south-east but Preston, Chorley and the north-west. 'They have to be built somewhere,' he said.</p> <p>In Avenue Gardens, the fight goes on. The grassland in dispute here, like everything else about the street, is smaller than in Clayton-le-Woods. Facing a row of tidy Edwardian homes, it is on a plot belonging to the estate of a long-time resident who died several years ago. The developer, Grayswood Properties, beat a tactical retreat after the first wave of neighbourhood protests, but has resubmitted plans for a slightly smaller group of five flats and three-bedroom houses with underground parking. </p> <p>But Julia Bates, with solid neighbourhood support if the latest evening strategy session is any indication, remains determined to block the scheme. 'This isn't social housing, fulfilling a social need,' she argued. 'The bottom has dropped out of the new-build market, but developers are trying to shoehorn a ridiculous number of homes on tiny plots of land, leaving a vision of the future where we don't have green spaces.'</p> <p>She said she had expected 'apathy' at calls to protest against the redrawn plans. 'But people here are more determined than ever - and angry.' And it is an anger, she senses, whose political time has come. 'People say I'm a Nimby. But I'm not. I am a Niaby - I don't want this to happen in anyone's garden.'</p>",
  "<p>Ambitious Indian companies are flexing their muscles in the global economy: new research by accountant KPMG shows India is poised to become a net 'deal exporter', with more of its firms snapping up rivals overseas than surrendering to foreign buyers.</p> <p>High-profile buyouts such as Indian conglomerate Tata's acquisition of Jaguar Land Rover, and Mittal Steel's mega-merger with Arcelor, are just the tip of the iceberg, according to KPMG, which has tracked deals between emerging market businesses and developed economies since 2003.</p> <p>During that period, Indian firms have made 322 deals in countries such as the US and Europe, while 340 Indian firms have been swallowed by inward investors. Ian Gomes, chairman of KPMG's new and emerging markets practice in the UK, predicts that outward deals from India will soon overtake the number of inward investments.</p> <p>Back-office IT expertise is probably India's best-known export, but takeover targets have been in diverse sectors, from Whyte and Mackay whisky, bought by India's United Breweries last year, to London's oldest stockbroker - Hichens, Harrison and co - bought earlier this year by Delhi firm Religare Enterprises.</p> <p>Many of the deals clocked by KPMG are relatively small: Gomes said the average value may be just $50m, once the huge players such as Tata and drug giant Ranbaxy are excluded.</p> <p>India's economy has expanded rapidly over the past decade, and is still expected to achieve growth of up to 8 per cent this year, in the face of the global slowdown.</p> <p>'We're witnessing something that can only be described as an industrial revolution in India. It's moving at such a pace that it's very exciting,' says Vikas Pota, director of Saffron Chase, a communications firm aimed at British-Indian businesses.</p> <p>He added that despite the growing market at home, Indian businesses look overseas for expertise, as well as markets. 'They feel that to capitalise on the Indian opportunity, they need to be global players themselves. Skills are a big issue.'</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on August 19 2008. Mittal Steel's mega-merger was with Arcelor, not Corus. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p><strong>What she watched: </strong></p> <p><strong>Olympics,</strong> BBC1, BBC2, BBCi, bbc.co.uk</p> <p><strong>Maestro,</strong> BBC2</p> <p><strong>Who do you think you are?</strong> BBC1</p> <p>I have a theory about our spectacularly rubbish August weather, which is that a crack team of Chinese cloudbusters have sent rain all around the rest of the world in order to make sure that a few billion people stayed in to watch live ladies' archery heats. </p> <p>'Never seen rain like it!' said my mother on Wednesday morning, while we were both watching the rowing, albeit 12,000 miles apart. She lives in a part of New South Wales that has been drought-ridden for years, but despite the fact that it is her winter and our summer we currently have identical climatic conditions. </p> <p>But the Chinese really needn't have bothered. As one woman alone on a dusty hillside above the Murrumbidgee River, and her daughter, alone on a rain-lashed hill by the Sussex seaside, could both testify, for two weeks every four years the world has an insatiable appetite for stuff it couldn't really give a ping-pong about, simply because it's the greatest TV show on earth. My mother and I may have barely spoken for months but we were both scrambling for superlatives in our mutual admiration of Nicole Cooke and Rebecca Adlington. Isn't telly great? </p> <p>And while I can't speak of the ABC's coverage, the BBC's is brilliant. So it should be, one may say, but it could be a lot less brilliant and still be infinitely better than every other global broadcaster. Obviously I haven't seen every other global broadcaster's coverage, but... the American stuff will be both parochial and hysterical, the Russian stuff parochial and miserabilist, while the Italian coverage will be anchored by women in bikinis. </p> <p>Having said that, I could do with a tweak or two. The Observer's own Eddie Butler is a fine broadcaster but his sonorous voiceovers do occasionally call to mind Tom Baker in Little Britain, and his observation that 'If we're not uplifted by this, we're probably still missing what the Olympics can do' of injured British weightlifter Michaela Breeze's dogged determination to keep on keeping on was accompanied by the soppiest of strings. </p> <p>But we know there's quite enough extraordinary achievement going on without needing it to be packaged and sold to us with a soundtrack straight from Titanic. The great thing about sport is how we can suddenly and unexpectedly be moved, though rarely by what we're told to be moved by, and I fear that the spectacle of women's weightlifting is not quite uplifting enough, though Russia and Georgia's victorious shooters hugging on the podium probably is. </p> <p>Meanwhile Garry Richardson's exhaustingly upbeat interview technique with canoe slalom silver medallist David Florence was hilariously at odds with his subject's personality - cool and collected, as befits a would-be astronaut. Meanwhile Florence's family, who greeted his win with smiles, politely shaken hands and brisk maternal kisses rather than free-flowing tears of unbridled joy, made Richardson sound as if he'd OD'd on Red Bull with a helium chaser and was therefore more excited than everybody else in Beijing put together. Back in the studio, Gabby Logan was moved to describe it wryly as 'Reality TV', while Florence, on the sofa beside her, persuaded that stiff upper lip into something approaching a smile. </p> <p>But for every laboured descent into uncalled-for sentimentality, there is a revelation. I really didn't think I gave a ping-pong about table tennis until a beautifully made little featurette distilled both the essence of the sport and its importance to the Chinese into five riveting minutes. Did you know that the first American feet on Chinese soil post-revolution belonged to US table-tennis players? </p> <p>I'm not very fond of 'Team GB', or the use of 'medalled' as a verb, or a two-hander between, say, John Inverdale and Steve Redgrave, and I expect I'll never know what differentiates a Yngling from a Finn in the sailing, but this didn't much matter when I could at any time press the red button and check out the extraordinarily uplifting sight of the US men's swimming relay team. </p> <p>'And we'll just show you that again... ladies,' said Gabby generously as we cut to Michael Phelps and friends standing poolside, ripped and stripped of those unsexy swimming condoms, celebrating yet another victory in glorious slo-mo. Verily the Olympic spirit is a beautiful thing. </p> <p>I watched <strong>Maestro</strong> (BBC2) mostly because it was there, and not because I expected to be wildly entertained by a mixed bag of slebs learning to conduct, which just goes to show how wrong I can be because it was riveting. </p> <p>A lot of this was down to the casting, for it is only at the surrealist cocktail party of one's dreams/nightmares that Peter Snow struggles with his baton technique alongside Goldie and David Soul, with helpful hints from Bradley Walsh and Jane Asher... but once you'd got over the shock and shelved all your preconceptions (Snow ought to be good at it just because he sounds as though he should be, while Alex James would obviously be great simply because he used to be in Blur) then you couldn't drag yourself away from the gripping drama of it all, not even to check on the swimming. </p> <p>And I learned lots - not least what a conductor actually does. I mean, I understood the essence of it, obviously, but it's only when you hear an orchestra conducted very badly that you can appreciate why it is so difficult to do it well, and certainly the BBC Concert Orchestra has never sounded more crappily cacophonous than it did under the baton of Peter Snow, who proved to have the innate musicality of a weightlifter, albeit with much less rhythm, while Alex James's attempt at interpreting Bizet may have prompted a judge to comment that it was 'a rock 'n' roll Carmen', but they were just being polite. </p> <p>Aside from James, Sue Perkins, Katie Derham and Jane Asher all know their way round a score and cajoled ladylike performances from the orchestra, while Bradley Walsh's mentor described him, sweetly, as 'in the zone with the Prokofiev', and David Soul somehow got through it without kicking over cardboard boxes or crashing a car.</p> <p>But it was only with the final performance, when graffiti-artist-turned-drum'n'bassmaster-turned-actor-cum-all-round 21st century renaissance geezer Goldie took to the podium to give us his Grieg, that we saw why conducting is equal parts technique, performance and X factor. </p> <p>You straight away knew it was going to be good because Goldie looked so completely at home he may as well have been in front of the decks in a club. By the end, however, when his mentor punched the air and judge Sir Roger Norrington declared, 'this guy's a conductor... terrific stuff, total control', it had been a journey so thrilling I immediately had to watch it another half a dozen times. </p> <p>Goldie may not be able to read music but he has the blindingly obvious advantage of not only already being a composer of sophisticated soundscapes but also, via DJing, of being a conduit between music and its audience. Alex James may as well stick to cheese, while if the rather smug Jane Asher wins, I'll eat an entire cheesecake. </p> <p>Who knew August TV could be so uplifting? Shortly after recovering from Goldie I found myself sniffling sympathetically as Patsy Kensit delved into her late father's criminal background during the first in the new series of <strong>Who Do You Think You Are?</strong> (BBC1). James Kensit, a 1960s associate of both the Krays and the Richardsons, and therefore clearly a man of considerable diplomatic skills, was in and out of prison before Patsy was born. </p> <p>As she traced generation after generation of impoverished Kensits back to the Bethnal Green slums of the 19th century, becoming more tearful and less able to string an entire sentence together as she went ('it seems ludicrous that it would move me...'), one prayed for a bit of good news, or at least some closure. </p> <p>Thank god, then, for her great-great-great-great-grandfather, the Rev Thomas Mayne, a man of infinite charity and a very Protestant work ethic - clearly passed down to (Catholic) Patsy, who has worked pretty much non-stop since 1972. Mayne was gifted an honorary degree by Lambeth Palace for his charitable work, and after ministering to 65,000 souls in the poorest parish in London was promoted to a small one in rural Buckinghamshire, where in turn he was held in such high esteem he was buried in the chancel of his church - or 'right at the heart of the house of God' as the present vicar elegantly put it. </p> <p>While anybody would be proud to have a Thomas Mayne as a branch of their family tree, Ms Kensit was so obviously uplifted she looked ready to climb up and swing from him. Lovely telly, mercifully free of national anthems.</p>",
  "<p>It is clear, in the short term at least, what must happen in South Ossetia. Russia must honour its ceasefire agreement with Georgia. Russian troops must withdraw to positions they held before the current conflict erupted. Both sides must allow peacekeepers into the region and return to negotiations on the final status for the enclave. Georgia's attack on the separatists would be reversed, Russia's ostensible war aim would be achieved.</p> <p>Moscow's reluctance to follow such a course proves that its war aims were more ambitious: a fundamental change in the balance of power in Europe.</p> <p>It is easy to see why the Kremlin should want such a shift. At the end of the Cold War, it lost control of a vast economic-political bloc. It ceded territory to neighbouring states and saw a rival military alliance advance on its borders. Few states are easily reconciled to such a drastic shrinkage of global status.</p> <p>Although Britain knows the pain of losing an empire, the more common comparison is with Germany after the First World War - humiliated, plunged into an economic crisis, followed by the emergence of an authoritarian ruler pledging to restore national pride.</p> <p>Given the parallels, it is hardly surprising that many of Moscow's former satellites are nervous. They see Russia's intervention in South Ossetia as a blatant land grab. In the Kremlin's claim to be protecting the local population, they hear echoes of Hitler's professed concern for the well-being of Sudeten Germans before marching into Czechoslovakia.</p> <p>That interpretation is shared, in part, by Washington. The US has responded to the South Ossetian crisis with renewed determination to hem Russia in. Its method is to press ahead with plans to include Georgia and Ukraine in Nato and to deploy anti-ballistic-missile defence systems in Poland and the Czech Republic. When, in the past, Russia has complained about the 'son of Star Wars' system, the US has insisted it is meant to deter Iran. It now looks transparently like old-fashioned Cold War escalation.</p> <p>One crucial difference between the current East-West confrontation and the Cold War is that, this time, the economic ties binding the two sides are stronger. Russia needs access to Western markets; the West - and Europe in particular - needs Russian oil and gas. That creates an opportunity for the European Union, the world's largest single market, to play a moderating role, steering the conversation away from military grandstanding and towards economic negotiation.</p> <p>But there is another, more worrying factor distinguishing present hostilities from the Cold War enmity. Under Soviet rule, many Russians privately shared the West's view of their leaders as thugs. But the Russian intelligentsia that secretly admired democracy has been either crushed or co-opted by Vladimir Putin.</p> <p>Unlike the tired dogma of Marxist-Leninism, Mr Putin's brand of militarist nationalism enjoys genuine popular support.</p> <p>Such a country will not defer to Nato out of respect for its members' status as democracies. But it might be convinced of the wisdom of settling disputes through international institutions rather than military adventurism. Inevitably, that raises allegations of Western hypocrisy. In defence of its campaign in South Ossetia, Russia cites Western actions in Kosovo and Iraq. That is neat rhetoric from the Kremlin, but as justification for its assault on Georgia it is plainly cynical. Russia's claim to be 'keeping the peace' in South Ossetia is belied by its army's penetration into undisputed Georgian territory and by credible allegations that it is facilitating atrocities by anti-Georgian militias.</p> <p>Such aggression must not be rewarded. But Cold War-style brinkmanship will not make Russia's neighbours safer. It will only reinforce the Kremlin's view that small states are pawns in a strategic game. The best guarantee of security and peace in Europe since the end of the Cold War has been economic integration, achieved through the EU. It is Brussels, not Washington, that stands the best chance of persuading Moscow to change its ways.</p>",
  "<p>Fans of football teams with no hope of winning the league get their thrills from derbies or the occasional giant killing in the early rounds of the FA Cup. In politics, the top prizes are sewn up even more tidily than the Premier League. At Westminster, Labour and the Tories fight over first place, while the Liberal Democrats creatively explore different ways to come third.</p> <p>A new season is about to get under way and, while no one can rule out a spectacular upset, it looks as if Team Cameron has the title in the bag.</p> <p>Scotland and Wales have their own nationalist dynamics, of course. But in England, too, there is action away from the centre that, like a good mid-table clash, makes for compelling viewing, even though less is ostensibly at stake. The prize is fourth place and two parties - the Greens and the BNP - are in contention.</p> <p>In London's mayoral election, the Green candidate Sian Berry and the BNP's Richard Barnbrook received 77,374 and 69,710 votes respectively. The Greens also kept the BNP in fifth place in the ballot for the London Assembly, taking two seats to the BNP's one. Meanwhile, the far right beat the environmentalists in four out of 14 Assembly constituencies. Nationally, at local council level, the Greens are just ahead of the BNP - 47 seats to 37 - though the far right made twice as many gains as the Greens in May's elections. In June's Henley byelection, 73 votes separated the Greens and the BNP in third and fourth places. Labour came fifth.</p> <p>So what? First past the post makes it impossible for tiny parties to break through and, with around 1 per cent of the national vote each, these minnows would struggle under any voting system. Westminster is not about to be overrun by hippies or fascists.</p> <p>But the Green versus BNP competition matters. For a start, if a party dedicated to saving the 'traditional British genotype' from 'extinction' by mixed-race marriages gets roughly as many votes as a party dedicated to saving the planet from climate change, something is wrong. </p> <p>Of course, the Greens have had their issue poached by the big three, while the far right has anti-miscegenation policy all to itself. But fringe parties don't compete with the mainstream in the usual way. If voters are simply shopping around for a party that sounds tough on immigration, for example, they could vote Tory or, for that matter, Labour, which has tacked steadily rightwards on the issue in recent years. The point of the BNP is that they see everything - housing, the economy, crime - through the prism of race. When mainstream politicians talk about immigration as a problem, the potential BNP voter takes it as confirmation of his fears, while retaining the suspicion that the Establishment won't do anything about it. Green voters feel similarly about their cause. Labour and Tory pledges on the environment are seen as empty rhetoric. (The crucial difference is that the Greens' cause is a good one.) </p> <p>A fringe party represents people who meet two criteria. First, they deeply distrust the three main players, seeing them as out of touch, dishonest and incapable of addressing some issue that matters to them above all others. Second, they bother to vote. Think of the Greens and the BNP competing to lead the political wing of British cynicism. Clearly, that is another reason why we should care which of them does better. </p> <p>That cynicism thrives when people feel alienated from a distant ruling class, believing that, for all their professed differences, the main parties are basically 'all the same'. That is not a difficult proposition to sell at the moment.</p> <p>The great truism of English politics is that elections are won on the centre ground. Tony Blair held it for 10 years, now David Cameron claims it. A big argument these days amounts to the whether there should be more academy schools or loads more academy schools? Should the NHS be opened up to 'competition' or just 'contestability'?</p> <p>And that is the concrete stuff. In the absence of competing policies, a bizarre battle has erupted for possession of abstract nouns. Immigration Minister Liam Byrne, often dubbed a 'rising star' of the Labour party (can stars rise when the sky is falling?), wrote an article last week rubbishing David Cameron's claim to the idea of 'fraternity'. The Tories, meanwhile, in a bid to undermine a Gordon Brown comeback in the autumn, are campaigning this week on the issue of 'fairness', the Prime Minister's new favourite word after he lost 'prudence' to the credit crunch.</p> <p>All this posturing is based on evidence that the voting public, as it showed by rejecting the Tories in their angry, sulking years, likes moderation. But that doesn't tell you anything about the non-voting public. More people abstained in both of the last two general elections than endorsed the winning side.</p> <p>That might be because we are a nation of sloths who only bother to choose between candidates if they are up for eviction via premium-rate phone line. But it is also because political debate has become so arcane and is getting worse. Is David Miliband Blairite, post-Blairite or Blair-lite? To people with better things to do than read think-tank pamphlets all day, the difference is not obvious.</p> <p>All parties are in the centre, but with no clear direction of travel. Their political compasses are liable to be influenced by whichever fringe manages to exert the strongest magnetic pull. That gives influence to a maverick fourth party, especially when one of the big three is lost in the wilderness. When the Tories were in disarray, they were further destabilised by the UK Independence party. The presence of a militant anti-Europe wing over the past decade successfully skewed mainstream politics. England now has a fixed Eurosceptic bias.</p> <p>Ukip looks like a spent force. It didn't achieve withdrawal from the EU, but helped to shape the debate. The same process could affect the way mainstream parties talk about the environment or immigration, depending on how the Greens and the BNP perform.</p> <p>The BNP's recent local election results were surprisingly good given that the party is in schism. Last year, a 'Real BNP' faction formed in rebellion against party leader Nick Griffin, who is accused of failing to modernise, being 'arrogant' (just like in ordinary politics) and deploying the 'security department' of the party to burgle rebel members' homes (not so like ordinary politics). Richard Barnbrook, who, as a London Assembly member, is the BNP's highest elected official, has a different challenge building a substantial far right following. He has to live down HMS Discovery: A Love Story, a film he made in 1989 that includes scenes of naked men frolicking and a soundtrack of apparently gay erotic poetry. 'It was an art film, end of story. Not a bloody porn film,' he says.</p> <p>For the Greens, the problem has not been too many leaders, but none at all. They have traditionally been led by two 'principal speakers' mandated to represent the party in public, but not decide policy. That will change next month when they hold their first leadership election, which is almost certain to be won by MEP Caroline Lucas. She is intelligent and articulate. Griffin just about manages louche charisma.</p> <p>The question is: which of them would we rather see hogging the airwaves on election night? Both parties are hoping to gain their first Westminster seat at the next election - the Greens in Brighton Pavilion, the BNP in the new east London constituency of Dagenham and Rainham. Both need the votes of disgruntled Labour supporters to win. If, as looks likely, the Tories are cruising towards an easy victory, disproportionate attention will be paid to the impact of wild-card candidates. (Remember a foaming Jimmy Goldsmith taunting David Mellor out of his seat in 1997?) As Labour heads into the wilderness, there will be much opining on what the protest vote meant.</p> <p>Everyone takes some interest in who tops the political Premier League. After all, the winner gets to run the country. But there are rewards available lower down the table. There is a nail-biting competition for the Uefa Cup place of English politics - the opportunity to give political shape to much wider scepticism and disillusionment; to be the flag-bearer for anti-Establishment feeling. Our nation would be in a sorry state if the BNP beat the Greens to that prize.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Andrew Rawnsley is away.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Monday August 18 2008. In London's mayoral election, the Green candidate Sian Berry did not comfortably beat the BNP's Richard Barnbrook by 409,101 votes to 198,319, as suggested in the article above. The candidates received 77,374 and 69,710 votes respectively. This has been corrected. </p>",

See you in 7 hours when I assume you will be an ashen-faced, broken shell of a man.\" Is it wrong to admit that I'm ashen-faced already?</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>12.52am:</strong> Here's how ruthless night-time online journalists can be: \"That's quite a good thing to happen, that,\" says my colleague Gregg Roughley, as the American athlete Deena Kastor collapses in agony onto the Beijing street, her four years of preparation rendered useless, her dreams shattered, her life a misery. \"Good for minute-by-minute reporting.\" Indeed it is: the American athlete Deena Kastor has just collapsed in agony onto the Beijing street, I can delightfully report.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>12.55am:</strong> \"Something just popped,\" Kastor said, during that moment of agony. Blister? Balloon? Probably not. She's out of this race, with what could well be some kind of bone break. Back among the running, Liz Yelling still leads for GB! GB! GB! although the experts reckon she'll not be there come the end.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>1am:</strong> Scramble for the drinks station in Beijing, similar to the scrum I left at a friend's birthday party moments before coming here. A band named Bombay Monkey had just taken to the stage, and I've just won a bet by mentioning that.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>1.03am:</strong> Liz Yelling is still leading here. Or Beijing, rather. The pack is kind of stretching out a bit, but they lost three or four runners within the first mile or so, the Eric the Eel kind, presumably. Brave Paula is still a-nodding in about fifth or sixth.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>1.06am:</strong> They're currently running through a part of Beijing that I think they modelled on Gerrard Street, London. Liz Yelling is the fastest through 10km, in 38.10, which is very slow, I'm told.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>1.10am:</strong> They've now just jogged past the \"Building of the People\" which was, apparently, the headquarters of the Communist Party. A fire truck is leading, then a family saloon car, then a motorbike and then Mamorallo Tjoka, who has overtaken Team GB's Liz Yelling.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>1.12am:</strong> And another one bites the dust. Having just taken over the lead, Mamorallo Tjoka, of Lesotho, has just pulled up lame. Another 32 or so, and this is in the bag for Paula.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>1.16am:</strong> Hold on, Tjoka is back. She definitely grimaced, swerved off to the side of the track, clutched her foot, but now seems to have run it off and is back out front. Brave Paula is still looking comfortable in the leading pack of about 20, with a couple of straggling packs now sliding backwards.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>1.19am:</strong> An insight into what this is all about: \"Paula has just grabbed a sponge!\" says Steve Cram in the commentary box, and this is worthy of a super slo-mo replay as Brave Paula dabs first her hair, then her arms and then discards the sponge. It's a GB! GB! GB! one-two at the moment, as Yelling and Radcliffe lead the pack.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>1.22am:</strong> It's not just athletics today, and there are 34 gold medals up for grabs in Beijing, according to the Guardian's \"definitive\" guide to the Olympic Games, which makes it the busiest single day of competition. There's swimming, badminton, horsey things, arguing, shooting, table tennis, volleyball and all sorts.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>1.24am:</strong> A few umbrellas are up in Beijing, and there's water on the camera lens. That means rain. The field is gradually being strung out, although the leaders are still tightly-knit. They include Paula.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>1.26am:</strong> Mamorallo Tjoka is now definitely done. She's pulled up lame again, clutching her left calf, and although she's grabbed a bottle of water and attempted to continue, I know an injured marathon runner when I see one, and Mamorallo Tjoka is one.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>1.31am:</strong> Trip, tumble, graze, yelp! That's the last minute or so for Liz Yelling who has just tasted the taste of Beijing tarmac after getting caught up in the pack and wiping out, big time. Her back is all red and grazed and her running shorts are stained. She's up and running again, but that can't be good, in anyone's book.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>1.33am:</strong> I've got two emails. Count them. <em>Two</em>. The first is from the night editor, who wisely suggests I punctuate this dirge with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/16/olympics2008.paularadcliffe\">a link to an interview with Paula Radcliffe about her chances in the marathon</a>. Done. The second is from Geoff Gilbert, who says: \"If Usain Bolt ran the marathon, without slowing up any more than he does in the last bits of the 100m, seems to me he would run it in about an hour and seven minutes. Worth trying?\" Well, he's got the 200m later in the week, so let's not rule it out for 2012.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>1.35am</strong> Liz Yelling has shown her grazed back to the rest of the field as she takes to the lead again. Paula Radcliffe's stress fracture is bearing up nicely, it seems, as she's bobbing along in the main pack just behind.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>1.40am:</strong> Tim Chesnutt is in Canada, and has an email address, which is music to my ears: \"My gal Stacy is not only serious amateur marathoner, but a huge Paula fan,\" says Tim, who then confuses me by continuing: \"and is hard into training for the Ironman World Championships in Hawaii in another six weeks or so.\" Is that what they call it? The Ironman? For women? That is political correctness gone, etc., etc.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>1.43am:</strong> OK, this is kind of vile. The Chinese directors have got a new tool called \"super slo-mo\" and they're using it like a kid in control of a video camera's zoom, ie, too much and inappropriately. So it is, that there are images on my screen of rippling muscles pulsating, bulging and oozing. It's not nice.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>1.46am:</strong> No Paula! No! Brave Paula suddenly disappears from the leading pack and drifts off the course to the side of the road. Why? No one knows, although she does have previous with those unscheduled bathroom breaks. By the time the camera picks her up again, she's making her way back onto the road and is catching up again now.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>1.53am:</strong> The Japanese runner Reiko Tosa, a favourite for this, apparently, is not looking too clever. In fact, she's practically in tears with some injury or another, her dreams dying step by step. \"That Japanese woman really needs to stop running now,\" sympathises Rebecca Strickson. \"It's not big and it's not clever.\"</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>1.55am:</strong> Constantina Tomescu, of Romania, has had enough of this dawdling, and has taken the lead by herself. She's a good 100 yards ahead of everyone else now, with Brave Paula leading the chasing pack. They seem perfectly content to let Tomescu go it alone.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>2.00am:</strong> Is a \"pit stop\" a euphemism for having a wee?\" asks Helen Burrows, who I think knows the answer to that, especially as she's referring to Team GB's weak bladder Paula Radcliffe and that brief diversion a few kms ago. \"The BBC are being surprisingly coy. Hurrah for internet coverage, though, as I can watch this in bed!\" continues Helen, which has also confused me. Do people have computers at the end of their bed these days instead of TVs?</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>2.01am:</strong> We're through 25k now, and the Romanian Tomescu is streets ahead, but looks like she might be regretting it. Brave Paula is leading the following pack. Meanwhile, Reiko Tosa is practically dead but still running. \"That's the Olympic spirit right there,\" says Gregg Roughley.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>2.05am:</strong> Brave Paula is beginning to do that head-bobbing thing that always makes you think she's about to peg out, but which has often preceded gold medals. Tomescu now leads by 44 seconds as they pass Beijing University.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>2.10am:</strong> Bad news for Paula fans, I'm afraid. The pace has picked up a touch and Radcliffe is struggling to keep up. She's drifted to the back of the main pack, as four or five athletes try to make up ground on Tomescu.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>2.12am:</strong> And we reach our level: \"Monty Python did that infamous bit about pit stops in their \"incontinence marathon\" sketch, where the lead keeps changing every few seconds as runner after runner went off into the bushes for a wizz,\" nostalges Brian Gibson, who is from Canada, but is in a hostel in Cardiff at the moment.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>2.16am:</strong> Tomescu still leads by a significant distance -- 55-odd seconds -- and Radcliffe is still <em>just</em> clinging on in the chasing pack. Tomescu is definitely struggling, with Steve Cram predicting, and me agreeing, that the medallists are likely to come from that chasing group. I'll do my best to get a few names of those in the Radcliffe pack in a moment.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>2.22am:</strong> These are some of the athletes in the chasing pack, which is now drifting clear of Paula Radcliffe: NDEREBA Catherine, SIMON Lidia Elena, KOSGEI Salina, ZHOU Chunxiu, TIMOFEEVA Irina, KOMU Martha, and let's give a big Team GB! GB! GB! welcome to Mara Yamauchi, who is also up there. Yes, I've copy-pasted them, but it's the best I could do.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>2.28am:</strong> If Paula Radcliffe was to peel off her own skin and hand it to a child-murdering sadist in return for the safety of 34 orphans, she couldn't be more brave than what she's doing here, according to Brendan Foster and Steve Cram in the television commentary box, who have never ever seen anything braver, nor can conceive of anything braver than her finishing ninth or tenth in this race. She's now drifting way behind the leaders, who are busy winning the thing, but we wouldn't know about it at the moment, I'm afraid, because it's all about bravery today in Beijing.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>2.33am:</strong> Putting bravery aside for one moment, Tomescu is still way out in front, as they reach the two hour mark. The Chinese athletes Xiaolin Zhu and Chunxiu Zhou are also in the chasing pack, but they're allowing the Romanian to get a lead that may be unassailable. Mara Yamauchi, who's GB! GB! GB! through and through, is also in that group and I'm officially switching my allegiance. Brave Paula is done, I'm afraid.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>2.36am: </strong>Constantina Tomescu leads by more than a minute now, and is now being referred to as Constantina Tomescu Dita, having apparently had the time to get married and adopt another name since this race began.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>2.40am:</strong> Seven athletes remain in the 'chasing' group, although they're not getting anywhere near Tomescu Dita. The Romanian is now sniffing some kind of energy-boosting smelling salts/poppers kind of thing, and is ahead by far.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>2.42am:</strong> Five kilometres left and Tomescu Dita is about three of them ahead of the pack. Brave Paula is still struggling on, but is way out of medal contention. Mara Yamauchi remains in the pack of seven who are closest to Tomescu, but if I know marathons (and I don't) Tomescu has this wrapped up.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>2.44am:</strong> Non-marathon news: Great Britain's <strong>men's hockey</strong> team are 1-0 down to Canada in their latest group match.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>2.46am:</strong> <strong>The Olympic dream is over for Paula Radcliffe</strong>. She's now broken down on the Beijing road, stopped, walked, screamed out, cried, and inadvertently posed for all the photos you're going to see on your newspapers on Monday morning -- and no doubt on this website in a couple of minutes. She's started up again, but that was proper anguish from Brave Paula, whose stress fracture couldn't hold up to the demands of the marathon. A sorry sight.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>2.49am:</strong> Tomescu Dita is now in sight of the Bird's Nest Stadium, but is showing the strain. There's super slo-mo anguish etched onto her Romanian face and the pack is slowly catching. But only a mile to go. Come. On. Mara. Yamauchi. She has a chance of a bronze here, which we'll take.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>2.52am:</strong> Less than a mile left, and Tomescu Dita leads by a minute, from, in this order: Zhou, Zhu, Ndereba, Komu and Team GB! GB! GB!'s Mara Yamauchi.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>2.54am:</strong> The artist formerly known as Constantina Tomescu, who was temporarily known as Constantina Tomescu Dita, is now being referred to as Constantina Dita, the relevance of which I know not. But she's in the stadium now and looking nailed on for gold. Mara Yamauchi has slipped back and is now battling for sixth place which, remarkably, would still be the best performance by a British woman in an Olympic marathon.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>2.56am:</strong> A huge cheer for Constantina Tomescu Dita, who comes bounding and waving into the Bird's Nest. She's running as ungracefully as any runner is likely to in this Olympics, but after 26 miles, who cares. There's an almighty battle going on for the silver between Ndereba and Zhou.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>3.00am:</strong> <strong>Constantina Tomescu Dita, of Romania, wins the women's marathon in 2:24.44.</strong> Catherine Ndereba, of Kenya, is second. Chunxiu Zhou, China, is third. Britain's Mara Yamauchi was sixth. Paula Radcliffe is still running at time of writing. Really.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>3.05am:</strong> Brave <strong>Paula Radclliffe</strong>, stress fracture and all, hobbles and limps into the Bird's Nest and finishes in, who knows what place. The official counters have stopped. She's in floods of tears as she's consoled by team-mate Liz Yelling and I'm going to stop this because the gushing commentary from Steve Cram and Brendan Foster is too much to bear.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>3.07am: </strong>Team GB are 1-1 in the hockey against Canada, although the feed has disappeared from my screen. And there's a reason for that: it's over. They drew 1-1.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>3.08am:</strong> \"I felt like I was just running on one leg,\" says a tearful Paula Radcliffe in her track-side interview.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>3.09am:</strong> \"This is not the end of the Paula Radcliffe story, please tell us that,\" pleads the BBC's trackside interviewer. Then: \"brave, blah, blah, brave, brave, blah, blah.\" \"Is this redemption for Athens?\" he then asks. \"Nah,\" says Paula.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>3.11am:</strong> \"That was a really brave and amazing effort.\" \"We knew her body might let her down today, but not her head or her heart.\"</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>3.13am:</strong> Liz Yelling, it seems, might have cracked a rib in her tumble in the marathon. More bravery from Team GB! GB! GB! \"They're bloodied, they're battered,\" says Hazel Irvine. Enough. Already. Enough.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>3.15am: </strong>Right, that's the women's marathon done and thank the lord for that. We're now back in the swimming pool, where there's not quite as much bravery, but hopefully a degree more sanity. It's the men's 1,500m freestyle, with Britain's David Davies going. Aussie Grant Hacket is the hot favourite.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>3.17am:</strong> Grant Hacket leads after 400m. Davies not in the top three at the moment.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>3.20am:</strong> \"David Davies is having to swim more. He's got smaller arms and a smaller stroke,\" says Andy Jameson, commentating on the swimming. Ryan Cochrane goes into the lead.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>3.23am:</strong> The Canadian Ryan Cochrane leads at the half-way point. Grant Hackett is second and Yuriy Prilukov third.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>3.25am:</strong> <strong>Swimming:</strong> The Tunisian Oussama Mellouli has swum himself into contention here and has gone ahead of both Cochrane and Hackett.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>3.27am:</strong> <strong>Swimming:</strong> Mellouli has gone for it from lane two. He's put the pedal to the metal in a swimming kind of way and has burst a good length or so ahead of Cochrane and Hackett with six lengths left. David Davies is fifth, sixth or seventh.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>3.29am:</strong> <strong>Swimming:</strong> Mellouli leads at the bell, which means two lengths left in swimming. Hackett is on his tail, but the Tunisian is ahead at the final turn. But...</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>3.30am:</strong> <strong>Swimming:</strong>Mellouli hangs on. Grant Hackett starts to come back at him in the final 50m, but the Tunisian keeps ahead and takes gold, his first medal. Hackett was going for his third consecutive gold in this event, but is beaten. Ryan Cochrane, of Canada, is third and GB's David Davies was sixth.</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>3.33am:</strong> Just to whet your appetite for the coming hours: Michael Phelps goes for his eighth gold in the 4x100m medley relay and, put it this way, my colleagues are currently writing an article that begins: \"Michael Phelps won his eighth gold medal of the Beijing Games.\" In the velodrome, GB's all-conquering cyclists go in the team pursuit qualifying pretty soon. They're last on the track. (Currently France lead.) If you want to read about Paula Radcliffe and the marathon, click on that shiny hyperlink above.</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>3.42am: Swimming:</strong> The German Britta Steffan wins gold in the women's 50m freestyle. It's her second gold of the Games, I think. The American pensioner* Dara Torres wins silver, and Sharon Davies tells me (not exclusively, she's on the telly), that Torres won her first medal in 1984.</p> <p><em>*Real age: 41</em></p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>3.48am:</strong> Hold on, what's this? Team GB! GB! GB!'s women's medley swimmers are in the final and doing mighty well after the first, back-stroke leg. Gemma Spofforth is second as she hands over to the breast-stroker.</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>3.50am:</strong> The Aussies are cruising to victory, but the butterfly swimmer Jemma Lowe has brought Team GB! GB! GB! back into contention. Freestyle now.</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>3.51am:</strong> <strong>Australia break the world record</strong> by about yesterday in the 4x100m medley relay. They're so far ahead of the moving green line that indicates world record pace that it's barely even on the screen. Team GB come in fourth, despite Spofforth's opening leg breaking the European record.</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>3.54am: Swimming</strong> The British swimming women aren't happy with their fourth. In fact, they're crying. \"I'm <em>so</em> gutted,\" says Fran Halsall. \"Well, that's encouraging,\" says Hazel Irvine. They break the European record but feel they could have done better and that actually <em>is</em> kind of encouraging I suppose.</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>3.58am: Cycling: </strong>Britain's team pursuit team are off, and looking comfortable in the qualifying round.</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>3.59am: Cycling</strong> After 2km, the British cyclists are only just behind their own world record pace.</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>4.01am: Cycling:</strong> The British team pursuit team qualify for the final. They're a full two seconds faster than their closest rivals, the New Zealand team, and look good for another velodrome gold. It's the third fastest ride over this distance of all time.</p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p><strong>4.07am: Swimming:</strong> Hazel Irvine knows how to set a scene: \"It's time for history to be made.\" She means Michael Phelps and she means the 4x100m medley relay in which the best advert for a good solid English fry-up is going for his eighth gold.</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>4.09am: Swimming:</strong> Team GB! GB! GB! are also in this relay race, but even this proud jingoist has been swept away in the Phelps-ian myth-making. The USA lead after the first leg, but apparently it's by no means good enough and SHOCK! and HORROR! the Americans <em>might</em> not win this.</p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>4.10am: Swimming:</strong> Phelps takes over with America third. Third! Can you imagine?!?</p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p><strong>4.12am: Swimming:</strong> Phelps takes over the lead for the United States, and Lezak has clear water in front of him for the freestyle leg. The Australian team challenge for a moment, but Phelps is not to be denied. Another World Record, incidentally, but this is all Michael Phelps. Gold. Gold. Gold. Gold. Gold. Gold. Gold. And...GOLD!</p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>4.14am: Swimming: Team GB! GB! GB! finish sixth in the 4x100m relay. </strong></p> <p><em>USA win the gold medal and break the world record. Michael Phelps wins his eighth gold medal of the Games, breaks Mark Spitz's record of seven gold medals in a single Games, eats 912 eggs, 16 omelettes, 11 hamburgers and 14 pork chops, cures cancer, kills Lex Luther, and becomes the most winningest Olympian of all goddam time. </em></p> <!-- Block 80 --> <p><strong>4.20am:</strong> Back to reality: There's the women's beach volleyball quarter-finals on, there's Australia v Russia in the women's basketball, and there's a MBM reporter dashing off for a quick \"pit stop\" Paula Radcliffe-style.</p> <!-- Block 81 --> <p><strong>4.27am: Cycling:</strong> More wonderful velodrome-based Team GB greatness as Victoria Pendleton qualifies fastest in the women's individual sprint. She'll be back to claim inevitable gold ... yawn ... on Tuesday. But there's a guaranteed gold and silver in the individual pursuit later tonight/today when Rebecca Romero and Wendy Houvenaghel go head-to-head.</p> <!-- Block 82 --> <p><strong>4.34am:</strong> Beach volleyball, basketball? Basketball, beach volleyball?</p> <!-- Block 83 --> <p><strong>4.38am:</strong> I know China are winning everything at these Games, but beach volleyball? Seems likely at the moment as the Chinese pair are thrashing the hapless Austrians (hardly a beach volleyball force themselves, admitedly) in the quarter finals.</p> <!-- Block 84 --> <p><strong>4.40pm:</strong> Amy Hordes wants basketball, but with Australia playing Russia in a women's preliminary group game, and what with it being 4.40am, I'm going to struggle to find the inspiration. It's 28-19 to Russia in the second quarter. \"Are the Germans or Swedes doing anything of note?\" Amy also wants to know and the answer is: \"Kind of.\" It's very very quiet at the Games at the moment, but Germany's Britta Steffen won her second gold in the swimming pool about an hour ago. Swedes? Shmedes.</p> <!-- Block 85 --> <p><strong>4.50am: Cycling:</strong> More Germany news: Stefan Nimke just set a new Olympic record during qualifying in the men's individual sprint. Britain's Chris Hoy and his elephantine thighs are out on the track again soon, so not sure how long that record will last.</p> <!-- Block 86 --> <p><strong>4.54am:</strong> Lo and behold, Chris Hoy breaks the Olympic record in the men's individual sprint set about 30 seconds ago. Safe to say he's the favourite for gold in the men's individual sprint. Jason Kenny, another British whirlwind, had previously broken Nimke's record. Meanwhile, Amy Hordes isn't satisfied with Michael Phelps: \"Is he scheduled to swim again today, or is it back to omelettes and mayonnaise?\" she asks. Phelps is done for this Olympics, Amy. Lightweight.</p> <!-- Block 87 --> <p><strong>5.01am:</strong> Catch up on what's happened while you were out shoving Bacardi Breezers down your necks and eating kebabs:<br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/17/olympics2008.olympicsaquatics\">Phelps wins eighth and final gold</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/17/olympics2008.olympicsaquatics1\">Hackett fails in bid for 1,500m treble</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/17/olympics2008.britisholympicteam\">British women's relay team pipped to bronze</a></p> <!-- Block 88 --> <p><strong>5.03am:</strong> And on the eighth day, God created Alan Gardner, and here he is to take over this flailing, flagging Saturday night, Sunday morning MBM.

Please try harder for Alan.</p> <!-- Block 89 --> <p><strong>5.12am: Howdy insomniac Olympic fans.</strong> While the British cyclists continue to eat Olympic records for breakfast in Beijing, sprinkling the tears of their broken rivals on top for good measure, in 119 Farringdon Road we're gearing up for Spectacular, Super Duper, Splendidly Successful, Smashtastic Sunday, as the headline writers will doubtless have it. But, before the main course, an entree - it's Australia v Russia in the women's basketball.</p> <p>Aus 32-37 Rus in the third quarter. Stay tuned, folks.</p> <!-- Block 90 --> <p><strong>5.15am: Team GB sailing</strong> My official Guardian summary for today reads like this for the next couple of hours:</p> <p>5.00/12.00 \u2013 Ainslie, wind permitting (GOLD MEDAL)<br>6.30/13.30 \u2013 Yngling, wind permitting (GOLD MEDAL)</p> <p>So that's what's on the menu - and don't blame me if either don't come good. Ainslie should be out on the water, looking for a gentle breeze to blow him to victory, so I'll keep you posted.</p> <!-- Block 91 --> <p><strong>5.19am:</strong> It's also a big day for the Chinese - well, just another 24 hours in Beijing really - with the first Table Tennis gold up for the winning. Not even Forrest Gump is likely to stand in their way, but for now we're in bronze play-off territory.</p> <!-- Block 92 --> <p><strong>5.24am:</strong> \"Morning Alan,\" begins John Johnstone in such a charmingly convivial manner that I can hardly refuse him internet publication. \"Here in Canada I have been stuck with a swimming commentator who won't say Olympics. Instead he talks about 'the last quadrennial', or 'the next quadrennial' or even 'this quadrennial'. Are there any other phrases people are already sick to death of?\"</p> <p>How about: \"And that's gold for Michael Phelps\"?</p> <!-- Block 93 --> <p><strong>5.27am:</strong> Free shots for Straya in the basketball, who have moved ahead of Russia, 46-43 up now. \"Brave, brave Paula Radcliffe\" has been worn a bit thin in the last few hours too, dontcha think?</p> <!-- Block 94 --> <p><strong>5.30am:</strong> \"What happened to the aussie bashing,\" asks Nick Evans, who appears to delight in typing 'Aussie' with a lower case 'a' solely to wind up his spell checker. Aussie bashing, Nick, can certainly be found on this forum. I'm cheering for the Russians as we speak, whilst totting up the potential golds from today which will take us above those infernal, bragging Wallabies...</p> <!-- Block 95 --> <p><strong>5.33am:</strong> Indifferent to my support, the Australians now appear to be crushing the Soviet Bear: 55-47 now. Meanwhile, news from the 'jing is that Ben Ainslie will be setting off on his gold medal victory parade at 7am BST.</p> <!-- Block 96 --> <p><strong>5.39am: CELEB ON THE LINE!</strong> Yes, it's the husband of the American beach volleyball coach. Welcome to the MBM, John Clamberson, all the way from Hermosa Beach, CA, US of - who !CELEB ENDORSEMENT ALERT! is also the proud manager of a Guardian Fantasy Football team. Here's an anecdote about China's nascent love affair with bashing a ball back and forth over a net stuck in the sand:</p> <p>\"When the Chinese won the rights to hold the Summer Games, they decided beach volleyball was a sport worth pursuing. Next thing you know, there was a gaggle of Chinese athletes and coaches standing in the sand in Hermosa, wanting to learn the game. Several years later, the Chinese women are #2 and #4 (or so) ranked teams in the world. My role was teaching some of the athletes some excellent drinking games and introducing the guys to California girls. They seemed to like that. Their coaches not so much.\"</p> <p>Ah, John. For all your efforts, the Chinese are incorruptible.

There are no times given for when anything is going to be on - 'later' is all we are told. Worst of their crimes against TV is that there are more replays than live sport, and even those are interspersed with ads every 10 minutes.

However, Elena Dementieva and Dinara Safina have just trotted out for the final of the women's tennis. Lovely.</p> <!-- Block 116 --> <p><strong>7.05am: Team GB</strong> The umpire is a Brit! C'mon. The girls are warming up, but there's absolutely no one in the stadium to watch them. Apparently this has been rescheduled. Or maybe the Chinese couldn't care two figs about the women's tennis?</p> <!-- Block 117 --> <p><strong>7.07am:</strong> The Russians are guaranteed gold and silver here, of course. Then Rafael 'Biceps' Nadal will take on Fernando Gonzalez afterwards in the men's final.</p> <!-- Block 118 --> <p><strong>7.10am:</strong> The Beeb's commentary team is in a right old funk about the lack of spectators \"for this, an Olympic final\".

To be honest, my Olympic spirit was flagging somewhat. But a ninth listen to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XbIZqg4v7w\">'Welcome to Beijing'</a> has got me back on track.

The wrong kind of rain has been holding it all up in Qingdao.</p> <!-- Block 138 --> <p><strong>8.34am: Naylor speaks out </strong> \"Three blondes in a boat\" is exactly the mix of infantile talk laced with the promise of tabloid-friendly pictures that the Media can't resist (especially the BBC) - and it's pathetic. Yesterday, when the blokes won in the rowing, it wasn't \"four toffs in a boat\" was it? Although, obviously, it was.''</p> <p>Isn't one of them ginger anyway? At least, more browny-russett than blonde. Sorry, I'm being sucked in like the rest of the pro-blonde London media. </p> <p>Speaking of which, Kenny Reid reckons the BBC is the culprit too.

The hurdler faced a barrage of questions in Athens after a startling improvement saw her come from being a virtual unknown to win gold. \"Why do people want to give a negative impression of sports?\" Halkia said then.</p> <p>Yes, why? You tell us, Fania.</p> <!-- Block 141 --> <p><strong>8.46am: </strong> Andrew Jolly's alternative medals table debate continues. ''For the record, Switzerland won a gold medal in the men's doubles tennis and Trinidad came 2nd in the 100m last night.

If <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_Universe_(Red_Dwarf_episode)\">Red Dwarf taught me any science</a> (and it did get me through a physics GCSE) I accept that there might be a parallel universe somewhere in which Britain heads an Olympic medal table but my mind and body are currently rooted in this space-time reality and there's nothing you can do about that.</p> <!-- Block 173 --> <p><strong>10.27am: Last bit of rowing.</strong> The men's eight final. Coming soon-ish/now.</p> <!-- Block 174 --> <p><strong>10.28am: Apocalyptic Waterworld</strong> ''No idea if the Beeb are covering it, or even whether Channel 7 are showing it live, could be from yesterday for all I know, but the final of the 49er sailing appears to be happening in the middle of a hurricane, pretty much all boats have capsized, the Aussies went in the drink twice as we overtook them. Great TV for once! So they cut to rowing.''</p> <p>Thanks to Andrew Jolly. That was live, i think. And Spain got gold.</p> <!-- Block 175 --> <p><strong>10.29am: 63kg Wrestling</strong> Japan's five-time world champion Kaori Icho has retained her title.</p> <!-- Block 176 --> <p><strong>10.31am: Team GB Rowing Men's eight </strong> Canada lead. Netherlands second. Britain are ''comfortably'' third.</p> <!-- Block 177 --> <p><strong>10.33am: Team GB Rowing SILVER MEDAL</strong> Canada take gold. The United States have the bronze.</p> <!-- Block 178 --> <p><strong>10.38am: Counterfactual ponderings</strong> Oliver Pattenden picks up the hypothetical baton: ''If Michael Phelps didn't exist, would world hunger?''</p> <!-- Block 179 --> <p><strong>10.40am: Women's tennis doubles final</strong> The Williams sisters have won gold, after beating Spanish duo Anabel Medina Garrigues and Virginia Ruano Pascual 6-2, 6-0 in just over an hour.</p> <p>Yan Zi and Zheng Jie of China beat Alona and Kateryna Bondarenko of Ukraine 6-2, 6-2 to take the bronze.</p> <!-- Block 180 --> <p><strong>10.45am: Men's tennis final</strong> Rafa Nadal is a break up in the first set against Chile's Fernando Gonzalez.</p> <!-- Block 181 --> <p><strong>10.50am: More team GB Cycling</strong> World champion Victoria Pendleton is through the first round of thr women's sprint.</p> <p>Oh look, the BBC are showing the ''Yngling Blondes'' again ...</p> <!-- Block 182 --> <p><strong>11.15am:</strong> Sorry about that hiatus. I just did battle with some HTML coding and came off bloodied and bruised.</p> <!-- Block 183 --> <p><strong>11.20am: </strong> And just when I was as beaten and humiliated as humanly possible, the code returned to pound me again. Fortunately, we haven't missed much Olympic action. I promise. Right, let's get this show back on some kind of road.</p> <!-- Block 184 --> <p><strong>11.23am: </strong> ''Why are so many winners photographed attempting to eat their medals? If anyone has smeared them with steroids, we could be in for a right old mess,'' predicts Gary Naylor.</p> <!-- Block 185 --> <p><strong>11.24am: </strong> Amandine emails from the Indian Ocean, suggesting we turn the Olympics into a <strong>global imperial grudge match</strong>. ''Can anyone do a Cold War medal table with the old USSR's medal totals combined? I'm too lazy but would like to know how the old empire is doing. Then why not one from the 19th century with the English empire medal totals combined? Maybe then we will be top. Just a thought.''<br><strong><br>One world. One dream.</strong> That fell by the wayside pretty quick, didn't it?</p> <!-- Block 186 --> <p><strong>11.29am: Men's tennis final</strong> Rafa Nadal takes the first set against Gonzalez 6-3.</p> <!-- Block 187 --> <p><strong>11.34am: Coming up </strong> The athletics gets going again at midday. And Briton Louis Smith has a medal hope in the gymnastics - the men's pommel horse, to be precise. There's badminton, softball, tennis and hockey, too.</p> <!-- Block 188 --> <p><strong>11.40am: Gymnastics men's floor final </strong> Another gold for China. Zou Kai took it, Spain's Gervasio Deferr has the silver and Russia's Anton Golotsutskov the bronze.</p> <!-- Block 189 --> <p><strong>11.41am:</strong> Who on earth is this a description of? ''Her thighs are like Bavarian hams; I assume she has to talc them every half hour to stop them chaffing when she walks. Slightly incongruously, her top-half is marginally slenderer, and on top of her head she has a side-parted ginger bouffant.'' <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/17/bulgarias_national_hero_so_goo.html\">Read Andy Bull's latest blog to find out. </a></p> <!-- Block 190 --> <p><strong>11.40am: Two Danes in a dodgy boat</strong> Denmark won the 49er skiff sailing earlier today, but race officials say they cannot confirm the medal because they are handling three protests against the result. The mast on the Danes' boat broke shortly before the start and they rushed back to port to borrow a skiff from the Croatian team, which had failed to make the field of 10 boats for the race.</p> <p>If the Danes are disqualified, Spain's Iker Martinez and Xabier Fernandez, winners of the medal race, will retain the title they won in Athens fours years ago.</p> <!-- Block 191 --> <p><strong>11.54am: Cycling Team Pursuit</strong> Britain's men just annihilated Russia to make tomorrow's final against Denmark. <strong>It's a world record</strong> from Ed Clancy, Paul Manning, Geraint Thomas and Bradley Wiggins. Elite Performance Director Clive Woodward is beaming from the side because that victory was <strong>all</strong> about <em>visualisation</em> and rugby balls and motivational mantras and middle-class self-aggrandisation.</p> <!-- Block 192 --> <p><strong>12.01pm: Imperial Hangover Medals Table</strong> According to Andrew Jolly, ''the Soviet Union would only have 13 golds, and would be in 3rd. Depending on who you count as being in the British Empire, we could be up to 23 gold medals and 2nd place. We'd need to invade China to get anywhere...''</p> <!-- Block 193 --> <p><strong>12.06pm: Common English Usage</strong> ''When did medal become a verb?'' asks Michael Bryan in Brussels, who I guess is upset about language being in flux.</p> <!-- Block 194 --> <p><strong>12.10pm:</strong> Gary Naylor tells it like it should be: ''Andrew Jolly's suggestion that we invade China in order to top the medal table is plainly ridiculous. We should do what we did in the 19th century and flood the country with opium.''</p> <!-- Block 195 --> <p><strong>12.15pm:</strong> I'm pooped. Tom Bryant is taking the MBM baton and he'll run with it all the way to 3pm.</p> <!-- Block 196 --> <p><strong>12.25pm:</strong> Afternoon all. You'll be pleased to learn that Lolo Jones has won her 100m hurdles heat. \"My body knows what to do now. It felt really easy,\" she says modestly. Meanwhile Rafa Nadal is two sets up and 2-1 ahead in his hunt for gold. And that is all the news I've managed to find in a desperate two minute flick through various TV channels.</p> <!-- Block 197 --> <p><strong>12.28pm:</strong> An email about Olympic medals that relates to several earlier emails that I haven't yet had a chance to read dept: \"I make it 47 golds for the British Empire. Mind, I'm including the USA and France in those figures,\" says Colin Williams, controversially.</p> <!-- Block 198 --> <p><strong>12.32pm:</strong> It's noisy down near the start of the final heat of the women's 100m hurdles and one of the runners is getting aggro about it. Well, if raising a polite hand and standing up is aggro. It affects the Guinean runner, who runs straight into the first hurdle, making little attempt to jump it, and then falls over. Her Olympic Games has lasted precisely 1.23 seconds. It could only have gone worse if she'd been disqualified for two false starts.</p> <!-- Block 199 --> <p><strong>12.35pm:</strong> Meanwhile, in the hammer, there are some big men wearing improbably skimpy outfits. The Belarussian thrower has more to throw for then just gold, too. He's been promised a lifetime's supply of suasages if he wins. Tasty. Bridgitte Foster-Hylton won that 100m hurdles heat, by the way, and Brit Sarah Claxton has also progressed. Good for her.</p> <!-- Block 200 --> <p><strong>12.37pm:</strong> \"The Chinese team are very poor in the catching the hammer event,\" chortles Gary Naylor of the antics of the Chinese judges scurrying about measuring the throws.</p> <!-- Block 201 --> <p><strong>12.40pm:</strong> North Korea's Hong Un Jong has claimed the women's gymnastics vault gold, and is proudly raising her bouquet of flowers to the assembled jumping and tumbling fans in attendance. There's some hot Brit action coming up soon on the pommel horse, too, I've been reliably informed.</p> <!-- Block 202 --> <p><strong>12.42:</strong> In equestrianism news ... it's <em>still</em> going on. How can this be? Is there anything left for them to jump over? Meanwhile, the man from Belarus has just furthered his lifetime of suasages cause after spinning and hurling his hammer 81.61m - which is a long way in hammer terms, apparently. However the Slovenian has just thrown 82.02m, jeopardising the suasage riches for the Belarussian.</p> <!-- Block 203 --> <p><strong>12.45pm:</strong> The sausage man's name, incidentally, is Vadim Devyatovskiy. Probably should have mentioned that earlier. Rafa Nadal is now 4-2 up in the third set, so expect him to be another to do that 'hilarious' biting-the-gold-medal-to-see-if-it's-real routine.</p> <!-- Block 204 --> <p><strong>12.46pm:</strong> Make that 5-2 now for Nadal.</p> <!-- Block 205 --> <p><strong>12.49pm:</strong> Stuck in an epic deuce battle, Nadal has had three gold medal points and blown them all, he's now up 5-3. There's a lot of grunting going on - even more than in the hammer.</p> <!-- Block 206 --> <p><strong>12.50pm:</strong> \"On the BBC trailer that they've been using to show the favourites for some of the track and field events, there is a load of text on the screen. Am I right in thinking that this is Japanese text and not Chinese?\" asks Ruth Jones who, despite having the title Dr in her email address, thinks that I'm the man who might know. I'll put this one over to the learned readers, Ruth.</p> <!-- Block 207 --> <p><strong>12.53pm:</strong> Brit Jeanette Kwkye is running in the semi-final of the women's 100m ... and ... she gets a good start ... and finishes in third! That means she's in the final. Nadal has clinched gold in the Olympics and is rolling about on the floor as if to convince people that this actually means something to him.</p> <!-- Block 208 --> <p><strong>12.55pm:</strong> \"If Gary Naylor thinks the Chinese bad at the hammer catching, he obviously hasn't seen their catching the javelin team in action \u2013 absolute rubbish, I could do better,\" ho-ho-hos Michelle Houtman.</p> <!-- Block 209 --> <p><strong>12.57pm:</strong> \"What a swing to be able to rescue an exploding set of legs like that,\" is how the commentator in the gymnastics starts his coverage of the Chinese competitor Xiao Qin's efforts on the pommel horse. Disappointingly, the man in question's legs appear to be resolutely unexploded. Shame.</p> <!-- Block 210 --> <p><strong>1pm:</strong> Once you do those flares, you are risking everything,\" the commentary team continue of the American's efforts on the pommel. There's also more talk about exploding legs. I have absolutely no understanding of this sport at all. Is this the most incomprehensible, yet exciting sounding, terminology of any event?</p> <!-- Block 211 --> <p><strong>1.02pm:</strong> \"8,000 pairs of eyes staring down at you - that's pressure,\" says one commentator. \"That's 36,000 eyes in total,\" confirms the other one, helpfully. And here comes Louis Smith for Team GB.</p> <!-- Block 212 --> <p><strong>1.05pm:</strong> \"There's the spindle and here's the triple Russian ...\" continues the nonsensical commentary. However young Louis seems to have done well. He did a good undercut out but broke form, too - meaning he has lost out in style, which must mean something to somebody. He scores 15.725, putting him into silver medal position with two gymnasts to go.</p> <!-- Block 213 --> <p><strong>1.06pm:</strong> Louis Smith will definitely get bronze! The next competitor has fallen off the pommel, blowing his chances. That's GB's first ever gymnastic medallist at the Olympics.</p> <!-- Block 214 --> <p><strong>1.07pm:</strong> \"When he exploded, he had nowhere to go,\" says the commentator of Fuentes Busmante, before adding \"he ran out of leather there\" for good measure. \"When you lose that swing, there's no return,\" confirms the other. WHAT ARE THESE PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT?!</p> <!-- Block 215 --> <p><strong>BRONZE FOR BRITAIN</strong> Louis Smith gets third after being beaten into second by Croat Felipe Ude. China get the gold. But that really is fantastic from Smith - that's Britain's first ever men's Olympic medal on the apparatus. Well done to the 19-year-old.</p> <!-- Block 216 --> <p><strong>1.12pm:</strong> \"Do those guys wear anything to protect their knackers on the pommel horse?\" asks Alex Pace, not unreasonably. Given the insanely tight trousers they are wearing, it's very easy to confirm that, no. No they don't.</p> <!-- Block 217 --> <p><strong>1.14pm:</strong> \"I'm sure that was novelty 80s band Bad Manners' front man Buster Bloodvessel competing for Poland in the hammer. We'll know if he sticks his tongue out,\" Gary Naylor. Hey! Less of the novelty, Gary, Bad Manners are ska royalty. The Sausage man hammer thrower may be going hungry for the foreesable future. His last throw of 81.51 only gets him into third place.</p> <!-- Block 218 --> <p><strong>1.16pm:</strong> \"Colin Williams is not entirely wrong to include USA in our British Empire tally ... never forget that the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht, signed at the end of the War of Spanish Succession, granting Her Majesty's Government \u2013 in addition to medal-free zones like Gibraltar \u2013 the entire eastern seaboard of (what is now erroneously known as) USA as far south as Philadelphia,\" writes Jonathan Myerson. \"So we would have to find out which state each competitor comes from but I think worth it in the long run.\" I beg to differ, Jonathan.</p> <!-- Block 219 --> <p><strong>1.19pm:</strong> Josh in Singapore writes to let us know that: \"Your coverage of the China vs Singapore women's team table tennis final is shocking to say the least!\" Helpfully, he seems to be applying for the position. \"This will be Singapore's first Olympic medal in 40 something years if they win. The hilarity being that all the Singapore girls are born and bred Chinese. Anyway, the Chinese girls are up 1-0 after the first singles game in this best of 5.\" So now you know.</p> <!-- Block 220 --> <p><strong>1.26pm:</strong> Tasha Danvers has won her 400m hurdles heat in impressive style. That's a good run for the Brit. In fact, this weekend is shaping up to be one of the Britain's most successful sporting weekends ever. Makes a nice change, doesn't it?</p> <!-- Block 221 --> <p><strong>1.29pm:</strong> \"What is it with Nadal's knickers?\" writes Al Parkes. \"On his way to winning gold, on every one of his serves, I was reminded of a quote by the great Jim Royle: \"I paid a pound for these underpants and I've got 50 pence worth stuck up me arse\" He's got nothing on the gymnasts, Al. Both meat and two veg were very much on display there.</p> <!-- Block 222 --> <p><strong>1.32pm:</strong> The most tedious game of baseball ever has finally reached it's conclusion. After four rain-affected days and 10, <em>10</em>, scoreless innings, the epic battle between South Korea and China is over after a stunning* 1-0 win for the South Koreans. The winning run was scored in the bottom of the 11th. As my colleague, Taimour, has just said: \"Bet the Chinese crowd forced to watch that to make up crowd number enjoyed that one\". </p> <p>*<em> Use of the word stunning may not be strictly accurate</em></p> <!-- Block 223 --> <p><strong>1.34pm:</strong> Kozmus has won the hammer, while the sausage man comes in second. He'll be both angry and hungry - which is a dangerous combo for a big man who throws hammers for a living. Don't get in his way later. From the TV pictures I've just seen, the winner of the women's 400m hurdles heat ran the second half of the race with her shoelaces undone. Does that mean she gets more points?</p> <!-- Block 224 --> <p><strong>1.39pm:</strong> Benjamin Arthur has helpfully emailed in what I presume is a complete summary of all the medals that would be claimed by the British Empire in the Imperial Olympics. Unfortunately, I can't open it on my computer. However, I'd suggest that, if he has that much time on his hands, he might like to click <a href=\"http://www.timeout.com/london/\">here</a>.</p> <!-- Block 225 --> <p><strong>1.43pm:</strong> Christine Ohuruogu is no doubt stretching, lunging and doing whatever else these runners do to warm up as she'll be going round the track in the 400m semi-final in 20 minutes' time. Provided, of course, she remembers to turn up, which is by no means a guarantee given her previous form in keeping her athletic commitments.</p> <!-- Block 226 --> <p><strong>1.46pm:</strong> While you wait for that you can, of course, head on over to Paul Doyle to find out what's going on in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/aug/17/chelsea.portsmouth\">Chelsea's tussle against Portsmouth</a>.

He's emailed his workings to me again in a form I can read and the results are, it's safe to say bewildering. Almost totally worthless, but bewildering nonetheless. Here they are:</p> <p>Based on medals table Sunday 17th August 1300 GMT</p> <p><strong>Total medals won</strong> Gold, silver, bronze, total<br> <br>1. 2nd (Communist) World: 58, 55, 65, 178</p> <p>2.

She's standing by her blocks looking nervous, if truth be told.</p> <!-- Block 230 --> <p><strong>2.02pm:</strong> They're off, and Christine Ohuruogu leaves her attack late, waiting until the final bend before getting her engine going. She eventually finishes in first, with a time of 50.14 her best of the season. She'll be in the 400m final now. Woo!</p> <!-- Block 231 --> <p><strong>2.05pm:</strong> That was a very good run from Ohuruogo who breathlessly says she was pleased with it afterwards. Meanwhile, Benjamin Arthur's list - ranked in order of golds won, looks like this:</p> <p>1. 2nd (Communist) World: 58, 55, 65, 178</p> <p>2. British (Anglosphere inc USA): 45, 42, 49, 36</p> <p>3.

French Colonial Empire: 5, 11, 16, 32</p> <!-- Block 232 --> <p><strong>2.06pm:</strong> \"From one medal table obsessed saddo to another, I salute you,\" writes Andrew Jolly. But what about the Ottoman Empire, eh?</p> <!-- Block 233 --> <p><strong>2.09pm:</strong> Sanya Richards has gone off like a mentalist in her women's 400m heat. Good lord, she's killing the competition. She finishes in first in 49.9 and she slowed down considerably towards the end. Hmm, Ohuruogo might struggle there.</p> <!-- Block 234 --> <p><strong>2.11pm:</strong> \"We've been sitting here debating 'sports' that should be dropped from the Olympics and ping pong was top of the list. The rest consisted of anything with a bat and a ball, anything with a bat and a net, anything with water and a net, indeed anything with a net. And synchronised swimming,\" writes a man apparently named Pommie Bastard. My opinion is that, any sport in which winning the Olympic gold isn't the absolute pinnacle should be dropped - so that's football, too. By the way, Briton Lee McConnell came in fourth in her 400m heat. She'll be off home, then.</p> <!-- Block 235 --> <p><strong>2.14pm:</strong> Nicola Sanders is on the blocks for Heat Three of the women's 400m. The gun goes and ...</p> <!-- Block 236 --> <p><strong>2.16pm:</strong> ... and she comes in fourth. Thats a shame. It was a tough race though and she was in the outside lane, which didn't help, but she flagged on the back straight and probably won't even get in as a fastest loser.</p> <!-- Block 237 --> <p><strong>2.19pm:</strong> \"Has Benjamin Arthur told you the countries he used to create his list?\" asks Bob O'Hara. \"I'm curious to (a) see if Finland counts as part of the Axis, and (b) to see how long it takes before the history wonks start arguing about the correctness of the list.\" Hmm, this Olympic minute-by-minute is in danger of becoming a battle-ground for history professors unable to take the weekend off. 50.71 was Nicola Sanders time. Good but not good enough.</p> <!-- Block 238 --> <p><strong>2.21pm:</strong> Nicola Sanders looks absolutely crestfallen. \"I gave it my all, being in lane nine didn't help ... but I just didn't have it in my legs,\" she says. \"I didn't expect this. I'm really disappointed.\"</p> <!-- Block 239 --> <p><strong>2.24pm:</strong> John in Singapore - not Josh, sorry about that - from 1.19pm is still keen for the mantle of table-tennis correspondent. \"One more gold for the communists. The Chinese Chinese wiped the floor with the Singapore Chinese 3-0 in the women's table tennis team final. It was fantastic ping pong to be fair to both teams, though. Well done to Singapore for getting their first medal in 48 years.\" Well done, indeed.</p> <!-- Block 240 --> <p><strong>2.25pm:</strong> \"We were talking about Olympic football earlier on, and we reckon that it should just be the U21 World Cup. Get rid of this U23 plus extras nonsense, that way, it would matter, and the guys in the teams would actually want to play and win,\" reckons Andrew Jolly. \"Also, get rid of the tennis, they don't need another event that isn't a Grand Slam.\"</p> <!-- Block 241 --> <p><strong>2.27pm:</strong> There will be a short break in the apparently never ending equestrian competition, after which the British team will be competing. I'm of the opinion that the equestrianism should be dropped from the Olympics, preferably this very instant. Surely just making the barriers slightly more ornate and moving them inside does not warrant the insane amount of horse jumping there has been during these games?</p> <!-- Block 242 --> <p><strong>2.30pm:</strong> Imperial medal historian and all-round spare-time king Benjamin Arthur emails again to let Bob O'Hara know that he did include the list of countries that were used on the list but, unfortunately, they were on the document I can't open. He also adds: \"I have included Finland as a part of the European German Axis; its 1,1,1 count is included in the grand total.\" So there you go.</p> <!-- Block 243 --> <p><strong>2.34pm:</strong> \"Could you let us know what's happening in the women's 3m springboard final?\" asks Bronwen Jones. \"Isn't it going on now? There's been no mention of it anywhere and you're constructing medals tables based on defunct empires instead! As a Canadian living in London, I want to know how Blythe Hartley is doing.\" Well, Guo Jingjing is currently winning, while Yuliya Pakhalina is in second. Not sure where Blythe is at the moment - I'll let you know if I find out.</p> <!-- Block 244 --> <p><strong>2.37pm:</strong> Blythe is in third. She's just launched a two-and-a-half somersault with pike and the thoughts are that she did it very well, despite her flat feet. Anything else you want to know, Bronwen, then you know where we are.</p> <!-- Block 245 --> <p><strong>2.43pm:</strong> The women's steeplechase record has just come tumbling down. Russian Gulnara Galkina-Samitova has just romped home in a time of 8:58.81 - the first female athlete to ever break nine minutes for the steeplechse - beating her own record of 9:01.59. There was also a brilliant fall halfway round from one of the medal contenders, who doesn't look terribly chuffed.</p> <!-- Block 246 --> <p><strong>2.46pm:</strong> Hot Brit action on the horses and it's Nick Skelton competing, who seems to be having no trouble staying on the back of his horse as it runs round the arena. This sport looks easy.</p> <!-- Block 247 --> <p><strong>2.48pm:</strong> The commentator says Skelton's riding for his life, though, which would make this considerably more exciting if true. He finishes in a strong time but gets eight faults. No idea whether that's good or bad.</p> <!-- Block 248 --> <p><strong>2.53pm:</strong> They're playing Abba's Dancing in between dives in the women's 3m springboard diving final. I mention that by way of providing 'colour'. Blythe Hartley nails another two-and-a-half somersault with pike and it's another good dive, which bumps her up into first for the time being. There you go, Browen. Beat that for personalised journalism delivered straight to your door.</p> <!-- Block 249 --> <p><strong>2.56pm:</strong> Back to sports that should or shouldn't be included in the Olympics - Steve Dove has a radical idea: \"I think we should get back to the Olympic ideal - stark naked, no animals, no nets, and the only judges are the ones who hold the tape.\" Kinky, Steve. Very kinky. Except for the removal of animals, obviously.</p> <!-- Block 250 --> <p><strong>2.58pm:</strong> This equestrianism really is nonsense. I have no idea what the point of it is - nor do I have any understanding of how the times, scoring and jaunty jackets have any bearing on proceedings. As a result, I'm just going to ignore it. Unless Britain win a medal, at which point they will obviously be heralded as great.</p> <!-- Block 251 --> <p><strong>3.02pm:</strong> Bad news for the Canadian diver, whose progress, bafflingly, I appear to be covering. China's Guo Jingjing has taken the gold. There's a bit of history between Blythe and Guo, apparently. No matter, Guo has now won the most women's diving medals in Olympic history. Yulia Pakhalina of Russia has finished second, while Wu Minxia has come second. Sorry Bronwen.</p> <!-- Block 252 --> <p><strong>And that</strong>, I'm afraid, is that.

  "<p>Table tennis is at the heart of the Games. It is a shy sport, readily played on a dining-room table. You need not even leave home to play it, and yet it is pivotal to this coming-out party. Without ping-pong diplomacy, the trip by the American team in 1971, it is unlikely there would have been the Nixon visit. Without a Nixon visit - unannounced to the public, he showed up in Beijing, where he was greeted by people who had sensed something must be up - it would be odds against this attempt by China to wow the world and compare and contrast themselves against America.</p> <p>These Games are the antithesis of the last ones hosted by the United States. In Atlanta, 12 years ago, the Americans somehow managed to put on a show that was both careless and careworn. It seemed as if they were beyond the Games, an impression confirmed when New York accepted London's selection as hosts in 2012 without even a shrug. Beijing, in contrast, is home to the Needy Games. Hundreds of millions want them to be a success, want their country to be loved. Those who speak excitedly of global domination are getting ahead of themselves: these Games are about impressing, not oppressing. </p> <p>The sport at which the Chinese are most impressive is table tennis. They have won 16 of the 20 gold medals since the sport was introduced in 1988 and look set fair to maintain, or even improve, that staggering success rate. China, naturally, has a large pool of talent to draw upon in this most accessible of sports, with the TNG tournament in Tianjin once taking more than a year to complete because there were so many entrants. </p> <p>In the women's team event here the first seeds were China, the second seeds were Singapore, whose players are all China-born, and the third seeds were Hong Kong, China, all China-born. </p> <p>The scene at the Peking University stadium on Thursday was compelling: eight state-of-the-art tables were arrayed in a stadium the size of an airport hangar. Looking down on these tables was like watching an octet of Davis Cup matches simultaneously. What's more, these ties would last a maximum of three hours rather than three days.</p> <p>Despite all the modernity there was still a youth-club feel to proceedings. In one game the ball got lost under the skirting and China's match against Austria (represented by Li Qingbing, Liu Jia, and, throwback, Veronika Heine) was umpired by a New Zealander called Averil wearing a light-blue blazer and slacks. Neither she nor the Chinese had their work cut out as the hosts raced to a 3-0 victory, winning the doubles in a very rapid eight minutes of play. </p> <p>The game is fast, which has not always been the case. Back in 1936, when Poland's Alex Ehrlich played the Romanian Paneth Farcas at the world championship in Prague, the first point lasted 2hr 12min, the initial referee retiring with a locked neck 80 minutes into the inaction. Finally, after a rally of more than 12,000 shots, Ehrlich clinched a 1-0 lead. It proved to be decisive, as 20 minutes into the next point Ehrlich produced a baguette and a 2ft sausage, and the disorientated Romanian ran screaming from the room. As a consequence, the rules were changed and Ehrlich gained a notoriety that was to save him at Auschwitz, when the Nazis recognised him as the world champion. </p> <p>A game that was about coping with boredom is now all twitches and glitches, concerned with anxiety. This is apt. At the risk of being glib it is possible to equate totalitarian states with boredom and capitalist ones with anxiety. Where would the money-makers be without status anxiety, sexual anxiety, social anxiety and all the other sundry anxieties? Pretty anxious is the answer. There's no money to be made out of people's peace of mind. </p> <p>In direct opposition, there is the numbing boredom of living in a totalitarian state, the ennui that follows from not being able to do anything about everything. All Olympic disciplines, but particularly perhaps table tennis, for shy people are nothing if not anxious, combine the boredom of practising all day every day for four years with the performance anxiety of it being over in minutes. Maybe it will be the sport for the fabled third way: ping-pong diplomacy being followed by the ping-pong dynasty. </p> <p>Back at the tournament, all the excitement came in the men's matches involving what one might call Further China. There was an extraordinary doubles match between Hong Kong, China and Japan, in which the former colonials managed to lose five consecutive match points. Their coach said: \"It's a pity we lost the doubles.\" And the Japanese player Jun Mizutani said: \"I told myself not to give up.\" The understatement and the doggedness, both satisfyingly stereotypical. </p> <p>The match between Chinese Taipei and South Korea was even better, as the players exchanged zinging shots to create as many ol\u00e9 moments in one Davis Cup tie as you might see in a Wimbledon final. When Chang Yen Shu went into a 2-1 lead against Ryu Seung Min, the reigning Olympic champion, a compatriot journalist shouted: \"Unbelievable!\" It couldn't last, Ryu bamboozling Chang into an air shot for a very rare ace on match point.</p> <p>And so to the women's semi-finals on Friday and the Crucible moment when the arena was reduced to one table. Arrayed against each other were South Korea, the last non-Chinese team, and Singapore. It was an epic.</p> <p>Singapore went into an early lead when Dang Ye Seo lost her first game of the tournament to Feng Tianwei and promptly lost two more. South Korea levelled the match when Kim Kyung Ah, one of the greatest defensive players in the world, recovered to win a match against Li Jia Wei, which lasted nearly an hour, 11-9 in the fifth. At the end, she sank to the ground in prayer, which is quite demonstrative for a table tennis player. \"WONDERFUL\" flashed up on the scoreboard. It had been a game of ol\u00e9 moments and rallies of 100-plus shots, a near-perfect match-up of contrasting styles.</p> <p>It proved irrelevant, however, as Singapore re-established their grip in the doubles and, despite Dang surprising Wang Yue Gu, triumphed when Feng won again. </p> <p>In the other semi-final, China beat their neighbours Hong Kong, China with embarrassing facility. The crowd did a Mexican wave. The PA played Queen's We Will Rock You.</p> <p>This evening China face Singapore, for whom an exultant Li said: \"I am so happy because Singapore has not won a medal in 48 years. We won't win against China.\" They won't.</p>",
  "<p>Finlandisation is back. During the cold war the term described those states which had a formal independence but existed in barely disguised servitude to Moscow. Finland, Jean-Francois Revel noted in his 1983 book. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/democracies-Jean-Francois-assistance-Lazitch-translated/dp/B000VZTVQI\">How Democracies Perish</a>, \"preserved the inviolability of its territory, what was left of it, and the right to live privately in a non-totalitarian society\" but was forbidden to accept Marshall Plan aid, join the EEC or sign trade agreements with Europe. It took its orders from Moscow in foreign policy. </p> <p>This is the fate Putin (and some in the west) now seek to impose on Georgia. And now, as then, Russia hopes to impose Finlandisation by a mix of hard and soft power. </p> <p>The hard power takes the form of tanks and taps. The tanks we saw rolling into Gori and taking control of the road to Tbilisi shortly after the signing of the deal brokered by President Sarkozy. The energy taps can be turned on and off according to whether a country pleases Russia. The gas tap was used by the Kremlin against Ukraine. German foreign policy towards Russia is now conducted in fear of the tap. (Indeed, Germany increasingly acts as an agent of Finlandisation within the EU and within Nato.) </p> <p>Soft power is used to establish a Finlandised state of mind in the west: Finlandisation is rightful because peaceful. During the cold war the French Communist Party would lead the attack against any link between Finland and the democratic west as \"militaristic\" and a \"threat to peace\". When trade links were proposed the French Communists thundered that \"any commercial agreement or association with the EEC was a threat to Finland's peaceful foreign policy\". </p> <p>Today, the soft power is deployed by an anti-American left and the Guardian's Seumas Milne <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/14/russia.georgia\">laid down</a> the line. </p> <p>The conflict in Georgia \"is not a story of Russian aggression, but of US imperial expansion\". Georgia is no fledgling democracy to be defended but a \"fully-fledged US satellite\". Its government came to power in a \"western-backed coup\" don't you know, and western support for Georgia meant \"conflict was only a matter of time\". And after all, \"'unipolar domination of the world has squeezed the space for genuine self-determination and the return of some counterweight has to be welcome\". </p> <p>Milne here manages something quite extraordinary: he \"forgets\" the mass escape from the prison house of nations that was only made possible by the collapse of Communism, while supporting the resurgence of an authoritarian Russia as the very means to open up \"genuine space for self-determination\". Astonishing. </p> <p>Milne finishes by making Georgia an offer it can't refuse: \"neutrality\". He uses the tones of a Mafia enforcer \u2013 a soft-spoken one, of course, like Tom Hagen from The Godfather (other people can put the horse's head in the bed). </p> <p>Then as now, hard and soft power work together to paralyse the military resistance of the country being Finlandised and the political will of the allies who should come to its aid. </p> <p>In 1958, when Fagerholm, the Finnish Socialist leader won parliamentary elections and seemed set to form a government without Communists, the President of Finland, Kekkonen, was summoned to Moscow and harangued by Khrushchev. \"Without wishing to intrude in Finland's internal affairs,\" Khrushchev insisted that Finland must \"have a well-disposed government\". Fagerholm withdrew his candidacy.</p> <p>Milne wants a government in Georgia (Georgia first, the others will follow) that is \"well-disposed\" to Russia. Soon enough he, and others, will echo Putin's calls for Georgia's pro-democratic pro-western president to be removed. Putin has cleverly laid the ground for this. The ceasefire terms dictate all future arrangements on troops, territory and borders must be agreed by Georgia and Russia. But Russia also says it will not talk to Saakashvili. Charles Krauthammer has <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2008/08/the_cards_in_americas_hands.html\">predicted</a> what must logically follow: \"Regime change becomes the first requirement for any movement on any front. This will be Putin's refrain in the coming days. He is counting on Europe to pressure Saakashvili to resign and/or flee to 'give peace a chance'.\"</p> <p>And there is Simon Jenkins right on cue <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/13/russia.georgia\">saying</a>: \"Non-interference, coupled with a realpolitik acceptance of 'great power' spheres of influence, is still a roughly stable basis for international relations.\" Saakashvili, Jenkins sneers, is a \"poor advert for a Harvard education\". </p> <p>Europe seems institutionally predisposed to Finlandisation. For example, Russia murders its own citizens who bring cases against it at the European Court of Human Rights, but gets to stay in the Council of Europe with full voting rights. Where is the outrage? Well, come on, \"No country is a perfect democracy,\" said Terry Davies, the secretary-general of the Council of Europe. (Back in the day, Jean-Francois Revel nailed this kind of mindset - \"the democracies are making their usual mistakes: ignoring even recent history, interpreting the facts in the way most favourable to Moscow, the way the Kremlin wants them to choose\".)</p> <p>Today, given the balance of forces, the imposition of Finlandisation will also depend on the irresolution and foreign policy blundering of the democracies. Sadly, as Ron Asmus, an assistant secretary of state under Bill Clinton, set out in an <a href=\"http://www.tnr.com/politics/story.html?id=9da1fd2d-1701-470b-b734-3fc365571e0d\">excellent article</a>in The New Republic (\"How the west botched Georgia\") blunders there have been aplenty. </p> <p>First, maintaining the fiction that the Russian troops in South Ossetia were peacekeepers was risky under Yeltsin but quite insane under Putin. \"What started out as a neutral role became a front for pursuing neo-imperial Russian objectives \u2026 Had we pushed for real neutral peacekeeping forces, we might have prevented this war.\"</p> <p>Second, after Kosovan independence it was obvious Russia would seek pay-back. \"In spite of this, the West never had a plan to shield Georgia from the possible fallout.\"</p> <p>Third, in March, Nato, with Germany in the lead cold-shouldered Georgia by dropping the <a href=\"http://www.nato.int/docu/handbook/2001/hb030103.htm\">Membership Action Plan</a> (MAP). This \"probably accelerated the path to war\", says Asmus, by giving a green light to Russia. </p> <p>Fourth, it is rumoured \"President Bush has on several key occasions failed to raise our commitment to Georgia in meetings with Putin - including right after the Nato summit.\" </p> <p>Fifth, the EU has \"been weak both in terms of form and substance\". Indeed, \"some EU leaders profess the need to stay neutral in the conflict while Georgia is being destroyed\". </p> <p>Sixth, the west missed every signal of Russia's military intent (the most obvious of which was probably the Russian military exercise for an invasion). Asmus notes that when a European friend told a senior Russian official in late July that he was planning to visit Georgia in September, \"the response was that he might want to go sooner and that September might be too late\". </p> <p>The Finlandisation of Georgia would have momentous consequences. Russia would gain control of the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline, strangle Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan, and push Germany and Europe further down the road of appeasement. </p> <p>The democracies should draw a red line, but not around South Ossetia. If the South Ossetians want to be part of Russia they should be. Blocking the self-determination of peoples is no part of progressive internationalism. Rather, the democracies should act in concert to ensure that any attempt by Russia to Finlandise the newer members of our family will not stand.</p>",
  "<p>Perhaps it was when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/16/olympicscycling.olympics2008\">Rebecca Romero and Wendy Houvenaghel secured both places in tomorrow's race for the women's individual pursuit</a> that the full extent of British cycling's Olympic dominance really struck home. A lock on the men's gold medal race has been achieved once before, by two German riders in Sydney eight years ago, but it has never happened in the women's event. In fact no British woman has reached the final of this event before, and tomorrow's final will be unmissable.</p> <p>It was, you would have to say, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/16/olympicgames.cyclimng\">a bit of a Brit-fest in the velodrome today</a>. Chris Newton's bronze in the points race was the first medal of the evening, to be followed by gold and bronze for Bradley Wiggins and Steven Burke in the men's individual pursuit and, as the climax to the evening, gold and silver for Chris Hoy and Ross Edgar in the keirin.</p> <p>Each of them was cheered on by the knots of British supporters in the velodrome, but the atmosphere in general this weekend has been nothing like as charged as it was during the world championships in Manchester last March. Track cycling is not really a Chinese sport - although they have one woman sprinter who may give Victoria Pendleton a hard time - and the crowd is made up of small groups of supporters from various countries being represented on the track.</p> <p>A fragmented crowd makes for a somewhat unfocused atmosphere, although the keirin races created the sort of excitement that makes this such a big betting sport in Japan.</p> <p>Nor do the organisers help with their hamfisted efforts at pre-match entertainment. A couple of hours before the competition begins, while the riders are circulating quietly around the banked wooden track, warming up for their various events, the giant screens and loudspeakers begin transmitting at earsplitting volume. The usual Welcome to Beijing and Children of the World anthems are interrupted by 30-second films in Chinese about Jesse Owens, Sir Steve Redgrave and other Olympic legends, and there is a little clip of Ban-Ki Moon, the UN secretary-general, issuing what now sounds like a pathetically vain call for all participating nations to observe the Olympic truce.</p> <p>Then from time to time a very RSC-ish voice - almost John Hurt, but not quite - intones a piece of inspirational prose pitched somewhere between The Prophet and Mein Kampf: \"You, the invincible man, teach us how to give of our best, no matter how high the pressure ... aquatic woman and flying girl, because you are able to achieve such greatness, nothing is impossible. You all make us proud to be human beings, regardless of age, race or nationality ... go and amaze us.\" That kind of stuff. Now someone out there will probably tell me it was written by William Blake. Somehow, though, I doubt it. More likely a close relative of Juan Antonio Samaranch or Jacques Rogge, I'd have thought.</p> <p>Invincible, however, seems to be pretty close to the right word for the women and men of Britain's cycling team, now with four gold, two silver and two bronze medals to their name. Not bad, you'll agree, for \u00a34m a year of National Lottery money.</p>",
  "<p><strong>10.50pm</strong></p> <p>The show is over folks. Thank you and good night. And for those who have just logged and want to know the result of the big event - the winner of the women's shot putt was Valerie Vili of New Zealand.</p> <p><strong>10.45pm</strong></p> <p>I've just had a quick look at the comments and it has started already; can we believe it?</p> <p>You can't address the question, or refute it, without sounding like a CoE vicar but what the hell. Bolt has never failed a drugs test in his life. As I type he is probably having an intimate encounter with the man from the IOC doping unit. We will have the results by Tuesday, so can we at least hold back on the cynicism until then?</p> <p><strong>10.40pm</strong></p> <p>Bolt has spent the last five minutes running/dancing around the stadium. Don't known where all the Jamaicans have come from but they are here in their hundreds. Oh, hang on - Usain wants us to know what kind of running shoes he wears, which might explain why he's showing them to the camera. So now you know - if you want to run 9.69 for the 100m nip down to Foot Locker and get yourself a pair of...oh, forget it.</p> <p>Oh , I forgot - the result</p> <p>1. Bolt. 2. Richard Thompson of Trinidad 3. Walter Dix of the USA.</p> <p><strong>10.31PM</strong></p> <p>They have rounded the time up to 9.69. What a snail.</p> <p>They're showing the reply in the stadium and the crowd and laughing in disbelief. He started slowing down after 70 metres, then looked round, then started slapping his chest. And he still became the first man to run under 9.7 seconds.</p> <p>Asafa Powell finished fifth</p> <p><strong>10.29pm</strong></p> <p>AND BANG!</p> <p>.... Bolt wins! CAPITAL LETTER TIME FOLKS</p> <p>BOLT WINS!! BOLT WINS!!!</p> <p>A WORLD RECORD OF 9.68!!!!!!@@@@!!!!</p> <p>HE STROLLED IT.. MY GOD WHAT A SPRINTER</p> <p><strong>10.21pm</strong> God, this is thrilling. Flash bulbs going off everywhere. the sprinters are out, preening. Bolt looks like someone has just disturbed him while he was reading a book. There is a sweep in the press box. I've gone for a winning time of 9.69 seconds - a new world record and, apparently, the same time predicted by Michael Johnson. Me and Michael - two giants in athletics</p> <p><strong>10.19pm</strong> Okay, here we go . The starting blocks are already out for the men's 100m. Meanwhile, all the competitors in the women's heptathlon are doing a lap of honour together. Lovely.</p> <p><strong>10.18</strong> I leave you with news that Kelly Sotherton has finished fifth. It was a game effort but she had to beat Russian Tatiana Chernova by a margin too and she couldn't manage it. Perhaps we'll see her in London, but that was probably her best chance. Right, that's enough slow racing. Lawrence is back for the fast men.</p> <p><strong>10.12pm</strong> Crunch time for Kelly. According to the stats she has a chance on paper of hauling in Blonska for the bronze. Sotherton's personal best for the two-lap distance is 2min 07.94sec, about 14.5sec quicker than Blonska's best of 2min 21.8sec. So, an extra half a second on form and she's partially redeemed a pretty glum two-days. Worryingly however I don't trust the stats. The same piece of paper lists Blonska's season's-best as 2min 15.34sec, which would suggest one of two things: a) Sotherton's doomed, or b) the stats are wrong. They're on the track now, so we'll know soon enough.</p> <p><strong>10.02pm</strong> While the heptathlon also-rans complete their final also-run and the shots putt under the flame, can I take a moment to agree with Lawrence: this is magnificent. It's a balmy night in Beijing, some atmosphere has at last been allowed to sneak into the Olympic Park with the arrival of the track-and-field crowds, and the most compelling event of the Games is less than half-an-hour away.</p> <p><strong>9.55pm</strong> Right, heptathlon standings. Ukrainian Natallia Dobrynska is lying first with 5,878, Hyleas Fountain 145 points back in silver and Lyudmila Blonska only seven points behind her. Lawrence has called short his break to try and decipher who needs to do what to win.</p> <p>He's back. Sotherton is 214 points off a medal, which means she needs to beat Blonska by 15 seconds to double her bronze medal collection.</p> <p><strong>9.47</strong> Struggling Brit-watch: Kelly Sotherton, lying fifth and in need of a very, very quick 800m if she is to feature in the medals, is running in heat five.</p> <p><strong>9.45</strong> The last event of the heptathlon, the 800m, is about to get underway now, not that the majority of the 90,000 in here are interested. They are far more taken with the qualifying for the women's shot taking place at the far end of the stadium. Home fave Lijaio Gong has just launched it an impressive-looking 18.90 to huge acclaim.</p> <p>Watching the first batch of heptathletes line up puts one in mind of Steve Ovett's comment about the decathlon when Daley Thompson was in his prime. \"It's nine Mickey Mouse events followed by a slow 1500m,\" he said. We are likely to see some very slow 800's here. These ladies must be bushed after two hard days competition.</p> <p><strong>9.38pm</strong> Lawrence is taking a comfort break so stand by for a crashingly obvious change of tone. We enjoyed the 400m hurdle semis up here. The barriers were deposited around the track by volunteers using natty little electric cars. They look like what Noddy and Big Ears would use if the Olympics were in Toytown. Ed Moses dominated the event for what seemed like millennia in the 1970s and 1980s setting the standard for sporting domination. Not even Tiger Woods has come close to owning a discipline since. Discuss. Things have slowed down a bit since - Kevin Young's world record of 46.78 has stood since 1992 - and no-one in this field has run within half-a-second of that. Looks like the USA will continue to win it though. Angelo Taylor took the first semi in 47.94secs, and compatriot Kerron Clement the second semi in 48.27secs, and did so wearing electric blue silk elbow-length gloves. Think Audrey Hepburn at a disco. His compatriot Walter Dix has been wearing them in the 100m too. He looked ridiculous too.</p> <p><strong>9.32pm</strong> Less than an hour to go before the big event and time to reflect on Tyson Gay's failure to reach the final. Should we really have expected anything else? After all, he hadn't run competitively since the US trials and he didn't look that great in the heats. It's a pity, though - at his best he would have given Bolt a real test and we would have been guaranteed a world record. Speaking of which, I still think we'll see a new WR tonight. Bolt looked amazing in his semi-final and he's probably on a massive bonus from his sponsors to set a new best.</p> <p>Now, if you'll excuse me I'm going to hand over to my colleague Mr Kelso for the next 20 minutes or so.</p> <p><strong>9.24pm</strong> My apologies for the lack of interaction thus far, but honestly if you look away for too long you'll miss something. For instance, I hadn't even noticed the heats of the men's 400m hurdles have started. It has never occurred to me until now, as I watch them run round the track, but this is a magnificent event.</p> <p><strong>9.15pm</strong> Time to start the women's shot putt. There are three Chinese women in this one, which gives me the chance to point out how partizan the home crowd is. Alas, this event is taking place at the far end of the stadium, so you might have to look elsewhere for updates.</p> <p><strong>9.03pm (Beijing time)</strong> Someone has just handed me a piece of paper announcing Bostjan Boc of Slovenia has been re-instated after earlier being disqualified in heat two of the men's 3000m steeplechase, Hurrah for Bostjan!</p> <p>Great news. My colleague Paul Kelso has just arrived back from the rowing and will be helping me from here on in by providing helpful pieces of information such as Janette Kwakye of GB has reached the semi-final of the women's 100m with a personal best time in the heats of 11.18. Joining her is LaVerne Jones-Ferrette from the Virgin Islands, who was one of the fastest losers. Cheers Paul.</p> <p><strong>8.47pm</strong> Too late. The boss saw the factual error and has told me to put it back in. You'll find it at 7.55pm. On the bright side, he had left his free rucksack back at the hotel and didn't hit me.</p> <p><strong>8.45pm</strong> Someone has emailed to ask why I am not typing in the result of every event. The answer is because the Associated Press and Reuters and the BBC have a combined 123,000 journalists here in Beijing doing precisely that. If you want a results service look elsewhere. If you want an impressionistic account of what is happening on this night of nights, mixed in with the odd, embarrassing blunder, then I'm your man.</p> <p>To which end: This is magical. Seriously. Warm, luminous and heavy with expectation. A lot of guff has been spoken, mainly by the organisers, about all the events at these games being sold out. But this was one really is sold out.</p> <p><strong>8.36pm</strong> Disastrous factual error alert!! Kirsty Coventry has indeed won a couple of medals for Zimbabwe. I even watched her do it. I am an idiot but in my defense I am under tremendous mental pressure trying to do this blog and watch what's going on inside the stadium. I will expunge the aforementioned error in case the boss sees it and hits me over the back of the head with his free Beijing 2008 rucksack.</p> <p><strong>8.35pm</strong> Mmmmm. The standings for pool B of the women's javelin have just flashed up on the giant scoreboard. I'm not entirely sure what they mean in the great scheme of things but my guess things don't look good for Kelly Sotherton, given her throw was 10m shorter than the best effort thus far in pool B.</p> <p><strong>8.30pm (Beijing time)</strong> Medal ceremony for the men's 20k. I'm not sure this is a proper sport but, who cares, when the winner is Russian. I'm not so keen on contemporary Russian foreign policy but I love the anthem. If I was Russian and won a gold medal I would have to be wrung out afterwards and then removed from the stadium in a wheelbarrow.</p> <p>All together now...Da-da da da da, da-da da da da...</p> <p><strong>8.16pm</strong>Second semi-final of the men's 100m. And...Tyson Gay is out. It's his own fault, too. He was looking across the lanes at the finish when he should have been dipping - even I know that and I've never broken a minute for 100m.</p> <p>Asafa Powell is through, of course, in a time of 9.91. That's a sensational effort but I'd have to say it looked more of an effort for him than 9.85 looked for Bolt. I'm not sure that's proper English, but you know what I mean.</p> <p><strong>8.12pm</strong>The official results aren't up yet but Edgar didn't make it.</p> <p><strong>8.10pm</strong> First semi-final of the men's 100m. Usain Bolt is in lane seven, our own Tyrone Edgar in lane eight. And they are off... and they are finished.</p> <p>Ohmigod, as Paris Hilton might say if she was an athletics commentator. Bolt runs it in 9.85. Correction. He strolls it in 9.85. I know it is my job to keep the tension going for the next couple of hours but I am sorry. There is only one winner tonight and it is the Jamaican.</p> <p><strong>7.55pm</strong> Time for the first medal ceremony of the night; the women's 10,000m. Tirunesh Dibaba won last night for Ethiopia - remarkably, the first medal of any kind in these games for an African nation.</p> <p>A note about press box etiquette during medal ceremonies. To stand for the national anthems or not? Personally, I stand. I figure if the athletes have put in all that effort to win a medal then I can at least make the effort to stand for 30 seconds while the anthem is played. I usually spend the time thinking about how I would react if I was up there on the podium and always reach the same conclusion; I'd cry like a baby. FAKE ALERT!! As the Ethiopian flag reached the top of the pole the someone turned on the wind machine and the flag flapped around like a hurricane had blown in. I will demand resignations the next time I see an IOC member..</p> <p><strong>7.45pm (Beijing time)</strong>My goodness this is tricky. The problem is there is so much going on. They have got these little electric cars which they use to transport the javelins around the field and they are brilliant. I drifted off, thinking to myself my three-year-old son would love one of those, and all of a sudden I missed two more semi-finals in the women's 800m. More bad news if you're British, I'm afraid. Jennifer Meadows is out after finishing sixth.</p> <p><strong>7.40pm</strong> Kelly is up again..and it flies through the air the minimum of ease...34.33m...oh well.</p> <p><strong>7.30pm (Beijing time)</strong> We're off. And I join you with some good news from the heptathlon where Kelly Sotherton has thrown the javelin 37.66 metres. This isn't going to win her the gold but it's almost three metres better than her season's best. No wonder she was dancing around afterwards. Bad news in the first semi-final of the women's 800m , though, as Marylin Okoro finishes sixth and won't make the final. A pity, given that she was second fastest in this morning's heats.</p> <p><strong>Pre-Amble</strong> Well, I'm here. I've found a seat and it is a beauty, right above the finishing line. I've been running around Beijing all week doing other sports and I haven't had a chance to visit the National Stadium. All I can say is - wow! This is at least three times better than Forthbank, home of the mighty Stirling Albion. The sight lines - as we professionals like to describe the view - are perfect, although the scale of place makes it difficult to identify individual athletes at the far end of the track. Mind you, some athletes are unmistakable. A matchstick figure warming up for the women's heptathlon event has just thrown the javelin about 15 metres. Kelly Sotherton, I presume. Kelly - currently in fifth place - is going for one of the three gold medals on offer tonight. She won't win it now, but she at least has a slim chance of a bronze. As for the rest of the evening, we have heats and semi-finals in a variety of events - too many to mention here, as I need to run downstairs to take care of some, ahem, personal business before it all starts. Then we have the final of the second most glamorous track and field event, the women's shot, followed by the most glamorous- the \"blue riband\" (as I am contractually obliged to describe the men's 100m). Who is the fastest man on earth? Usain Bolt is the favourite, although I might give him a run for his money if I don't stop typing right now and get downstairs.

  "<p>What do bling, the City-fuelled <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/creditcrunch\">credit crunch</a>, negative equity and cheap mini-breaks to Tallin have in common?</p> <p>At first glance, nothing, but if there is a common theme running through the last decade, indeed, the last 30 years, it is one of instant gratification for businesses, governments and for individuals. There has been a total unwillingness to plan, wait for something, to save or to look more than five minutes ahead.</p> <p>Of course, the City has had a rather particular view about the future for longer than a decade. It is a place where the next financial year is considered rather long term and immediate returns are considered far more important than financial health over the next decade.</p> <p>This culture has attached itself to wider industry, too. Why invest for the long term, when a merger or a sale of land can make the balance sheet look good now (and secure the bonuses)? No wonder we have such a depleted manufacturing base.</p> <p>The government is not exactly blameless either. It wanted excellent public services without admitting that they have to be paid for through higher taxes and gave us growth and prosperity based on nothing more than rising property prices, soaring debt and the PFI \"mortgage the future\" scam.</p> <p>Celebrity bling is vulgar and tasteless enough for those who have some talent, in sport or music, but it has been sold as a desirable lifestyle choice to people who lack the talent, luck or work ethic to acquire the means to afford it, at least in the short term, without either borrowing dangerous amounts of money, or stealing the products of this lifestyle.</p> <p>But middle-class readers should feel too self-righteous. Releasing equity on your mortgage to buy plasma televisions or luxury holidays, taking frequent weekend mini-breaks in European capitals or popping over to your g\u00eete in the Dordogne have become the only game in town for the aspiring middle classes. Why bother to make any sort of sacrifice, when if you want it now, you have to have it now and mortgage equity release will do the rest?</p> <p>Just try and keep up with the Beckhams. The trouble is, keeping up with the Beckhams is difficult if you are a school teacher from Dorking. </p> <p>At last, however, it is beginning to dawn on people that using properties like a credit card is about as secure a form of borrowing as the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collateralized_debt_obligation\">CDO</a>s, swaps and exotic financial instruments cooked up in the City.</p> <p>As individuals, and as a country, we have forgotten some very important lessons, which we need to start learning again quickly. If we grasp some basic moral, social and economic tenets, then the credit crunch and inevitable recession may be seen as opportunities rather than threats.</p> <p>For a start <a href=\"http://academics.triton.edu/faculty/mbotterweck/glossary.html#D\">deferred gratification</a> (remember your sociology classes?) needs to become acceptable again. The right amount of money to have is actually not quite enough, so that you have to save for a treat, and even, shock, horror, go without another luxury to get what you want. If you really want that holiday, or car, then save up for it.</p> <p>Most of us understand this and, I suspect, recognise that the credit crunch, ongoing house price crash and reigning in of excess, is a good thing. There is no great sacrifice in behaving a bit more frugally, not having a home cinema system in every room, not taking the kids to the Caribbean but going camping, and so on. Indeed, many people have already cottoned on to the fact that they can have an excellent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/jul/24/ethicalliving.creditcrunch\">quality of life</a>, and save the planet.</p> <p>There comes a point when we know that we are running on empty, and that we need to slow down. Do we really want to be debt slaves to the mortgage industry for the rest of our lives? Even as prices tumble in the housing market, the amount that people need to borrow just to get on the first rung of the \"ladder\" dwarfs anything previous generations have paid, and with (relatively) low inflation that will not erode the debt.</p> <p>This is not an argument against capitalism, or even the consumer society, and certainly does not show a desire to become a tree hugger. But as a country we have to reprioritise. We work the <a href=\"http://www.tuc.org.uk/work_life/index.cfm?mins=474&amp;minors=474\">longest hours</a> in Europe and have some of the biggest <a href=\"http://www.creditaction.org.uk/august.html\">personal debts</a> as well.</p> <p>But plastic is no longer fantastic, and our flexible friends are now cracking the whip. Hopefully the lesson of the next couple of years will be \"how I learned to stop worrying and love the downturn.\"</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p>The corner flags have been ironed. The turf has been mowed into a crisp up-and-down. Pat Rice has bought himself a new anorak. And, yes, it's the start of all that again. </p> <p>School's back in for Autumn. The Premier League is with us once more. And every significant top tier first of the season is about to happen at the Emirates. </p> <p>It's a slightly strange-looking Arsenal on kick-off day. To lose one high class international player might be regarded as misfortune. To lose Mathieu Flamini, Aleksandr Hleb, Gilberto Silva, Freddie Ljungberg, Sol Campbell, Ashley Cole, Lauren, Thierry Henry, Patrick Vieira, Dennis Bergkamp, Jose Reyes, Lasanna Diarra (and Eduardo and Abou Diaby to long term injuries) in the last three years looks like carelessness. </p> <p>Actually, there's not much Arsene Wenger could have done about any of these. Like it or not, Arsenal have become a bit like Ajax of a decade ago. A big noise in the Champions League, but still a high-end selling club and a stepping stone for the ambitious teen starlet. </p> <p>And what a manager Wenger is. They may not have won much recently. But this is the kind of stampede for the revolving door that might have thrown a lesser man. Whereas Arsenal have yet to show any real signs of cracking. The Champions League qualifying win at Ssshhecond Choice Sshhteve McClaren's FC Twente was massive. And a good start in the league will be vital too\u2026</p> <p>Also, of course, for West Brom, freshly emerged from the blizzard of pre-season preview best-guesses as everyone's faves to avoid the instant plunge back. This is generally based on the idea that they play \"good football\" , always a recipe for winning the odd game in the top tier. </p> <p>Teams-wise, today should see Samir Nasri make his full Arsenal debut after a bout of thigh and knee niggle. Cesc Fabregas, Diaby, Philippe Senderos, Tomas Rosicky and Eduardo are all still in various forms of recovery, while Alex Song is larking about at the Olympics. Luke Moore and Neil Clement are the headline absentees for West Brom. </p> <p>Tony Mowbray has been taking a bullish line. \"You have to have a belief going to Arsenal that you can win. Otherwise, why bother turning up?\" he told this morning's papers, not quite, perhaps, striking the right note. </p> <p>Still, it should be a good one: last season's \"Arsenal of the Championship\" against, er, Arsenal.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p>The teams are in. Nasri starts. As does Theo Walcott. No first goal for Van Persie - he's benched for Bendtner. </p> <p>A West Brom debut for Scott Carson.</p> <p><strong>Arsenal:</strong> Almunia, Sagna, Gallas, Djourou, Clichy, Walcott, Denilson, Nasri, Eboue, Adebayor, Bendtner. <br>Subs: Fabianski, Toure, Van Persie, Vela, Ramsey, Wilshere, Randall. </p> <p><strong>West Brom:</strong> Carson, Hoefkens, Barnett, Meite, Robinson, Brunt, Morrison, Greening, Kim, Cech, Miller. <br>Subs: Kiely, Bednar, Beattie, MacDonald, Dorrans, Pele, Martis. </p> <p><strong>Referee: </strong>Howard Webb (S Yorkshire)</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p>Andan emotional gold medal presentation for Gary Naylor, who has sent in the first MBM email of the 2008-9 season. </p> <p>He writes: \"Don't Arsenal have to win something this season? Otherwise they'll be football's equivalent of those girls who walk on the with the darts players - a lot better to look at than the main attractions, but not actually involved in what matters.\" </p> <p>Before bursting into tears on the podium.</p> <p>Is he right though?</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p>Tony Mowbray has just told the tunnel camera he's \"really going to enjoy\" today. Let's hope so. </p> <p>Jamie Redknapp thinks \"this is a good time to come to the Emirates\", perhaps with half an eye on the Olympic 100m final at 3.30.</p> <p>Talking of which: I wasn't totally sure how it would actually feel watching football again in mid-August. But let's face it, this is miles better than swimming. Or boating. Or riding a bike in a circle. </p> <p>All fine in their own way. But not football.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>1 min: We're off.</strong> First touch of the season for the Baggies. Looks like Nasri's on the left and Eboue's playing in the middle for Arsenal.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>2 mins:</strong> Might take a while to get used to this new Arsenal kit. They look a bit like Charlton in it. Early gallop for Adebayor. Nicks the ball across the face. Cleared by Meite. First corner of the season.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>3 mins:</strong> Two Arsenal corners in succession, both cleared fairly easily. It's already going one way in terms of possession.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>4 mins: Arsenal score!!!</strong> A lovely goal too. Nasri gets it, side-footing home from Denilson's cut-back after the Brazilian makes a lovely little run to the touchline. That was ridiculously easy.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>6 mins:</strong> Early chance for West Brom to hit back, but Brunt's free-kick is wellied over the bar.</p> <p>That was a lovely little move for the goal. But really just too easy.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>7 mins:</strong> Adebayor again in miles of space down the left, his cross finds Walcott and the header is blocked, perhaps with some part of the arm. West Brom are wide open in their right-back position. Get a grip, Baggies. This could be ugly.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>9 mins:</strong> Arsenal are absolutely bossing this. It's a frolic. Nasri and Denilson in midfield look really bright. Nasri has another shot from the left and it deflects wide. Corner. Cleared at a stretch.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>11 mins:</strong> Arsenal capering through at will. Again down the left, switched to Sagna on the right and his lovely flighted cross just misses Bendtner. It's a breeze.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>12 mins:</strong> Gallas joins in, blasting a shot from 30 yards that makes a clanging noise as it thumps the advert boards. West Brom are being duffed up here. They're being owned.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>13 mins:</strong> Looking back, the goal was a peach but Clichy had acres of space to play Denilson in on the left. Heads will roll in the Baggies dressing room. Clichy and Nasri looks tasty on that flank, though.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>15 mins:</strong> Tiny little suggestion of some possession and a little pressure from the visitors. But not much more than that. Still, it's only 1-0 which will be a bit of a relief.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>18 mins:</strong> Clichy again thunders down the left, crosses and Sagna shoots - deflected just wide with Carson nowhere. The full-backs are really getting forward for Arsenal. They look like they did this time last year - popping it about without a care in the world...</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>20 mins:</strong> Ten seconds of \"good football\" from the Brom as they pop it about a bit before giving up and hoofing it long. Arsenal shimmy down the other end and Adebayor almost puts Walcott in. This would be a very good day for Theo to get his first for the season. Big year for the young chap.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>22 mins:</strong> West Brom attack! Sort of. Morrison plays a nice little ball in to Kim, but he lets it roll away form him before he can shoot. That was a bit more like it.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>24 mins:</strong> Nasri, Adebayor, Walcott, Sagna, tip-tap-tip passing across the West Brom box, ends with Sagna blasting in a shot that hits a random body. Corner.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>25 mins:</strong> Bendtner leaps 15 feet in the air and heads powerfully just wide. Hoefkens should have tracked him. And he should have scored too.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>27 mins:</strong> Miller gets to the bye-line and wallops the ball against Clichy. Corner, but good stuff, better from West Brom. The corner is far too short, headed out by Denilson, then miles too long from Brunt. That was a waste.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>30 mins:</strong> More like a normal football match now, where both teams get a go on the ball. Miller flicks one on for Kim, who outruns Djourou and has a shot that Almunia palms wide. Good stuff.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>31 mins:</strong> Quick break from Arsenal, one end to the other, Walcott misses the chance to play Adebayor in and the cross is headed massively behind by Barnett. Good opening there. Get your bleeding head up Theo. Capello might be watching.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>33 mins:</strong> Miller keeps winning the ball in the air against Djourou. Warning sign for Arsenal, if not now then maybe later in the season. Miller does look really up for this. He's bustling about all over the shop.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>35 mins:</strong> More tasty interplay on the edge of the West Brom box. West Brom just about holding out, defending really deep. Ball breaks to Eboue and he blasts a shot wide. Good covering and harrying there. Still, Arsenal with all the ball for now.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>36 mins:</strong> Hah. West Brom's best tactic continues to be the long ball up to Miller. So much for \"good football\". Brunt lays a lovely ball into the big man's path and he gets in a tangle with Djourou. No one hurt happily.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>38 mins:</strong> Miller lollops on to a long pass over the top from Kim. Clips Almunia as he lunges for it but he's offside. Miller taking the fight to Arsenal on his own here.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>39 mins:</strong> Cech fouls Clichy on the left wing. Nasri clips in the free kick, Hoefkens heads clear. Cech looked a bit flustered there.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>41 mins:</strong> Well, plenty of possession and a goal for Arsenal but Carson hasn't made many saves. For West Brom only Brunt and Miller look like they've got to grips with it all. To be honest, it's been a bit primitive from West Brom, from the early defending to the ball over the top attacks.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>44 mins:</strong> More Arsenal possession, some jabs and feints. But nothing of any note. Just a little sense of a lack of penetration. Walcott mistimes another pass in to Adebayor and the attack breaks down.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>45 mins:</strong> Late West Brom corner. Kim takes it - but a terrible one, much too short. That was a total waste, last minute of the half away from home. Mowbray fumes on the touchline.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>46 mins:</strong> More fancy stuff from Arsenal on the left. Another shot mile wide, this time by Denilson. Yawn.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>Half time</strong> And that's it. A good start for Arsenal, if a little powder puff towards the end. You get the feeling they might regret it if West Brom can get Miller up against the centre backs. But that's a big if...</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p>So, a decent start for Arsenal. Van Persie looks to be warming up as they trot out for the re-start. They don't exactly look scoring bags of goals. But still plenty of time to go here.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>47 mins:</strong> As you were as Arsenal kick us off with a nice little spell of keep-ball. Adebayor spending most of the game out on the left. Not much evidence yet of new-best-mates status with old foe Bendtner up front.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>49 mins:</strong> Another Adebayor gallop down the left, ball breaks back to him from Denilson's challenge and he goes for an outrageous curler into Carson's far corner. Terrible hack wide in the end. Nice idea though.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>50 mins:</strong> Great West Brom chance. Lovely ball by Kim puts Miller though on Almunia. He sees the keeper save with his feet, the rebound is cleared off the line by Djourou. That was terrible defending by the centre halves, who let Miller run off them. Would have been a real sucker punch.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>52 mins:</strong> Oh dear. Bad miss by Adebayor. Sprints miles clear of the entire West Brom defence, who seem to have wandered off somewhere else. then tries to \"open up his body\" and squeeze it across th goalie, but it's wide of the post. You've got to put those in.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>53 mins:</strong> Another long shot. Adebayor scuffs it horribly from Walcott's lay-off. </p> <p>After that save Almunia did a weird fist-pumping celebration dance. Steady. First day of the season you know.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>55 mins:</strong> West Brom still going for that ball over the top for Miller to rampage on to. The chance came form a more patient attack with a lovely little pass inside. Stick to that kind of thing I reckon. Wenger's pacing about now.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>57 mins:</strong> Bit of a lull out there. August the 16th. Are we really doing this again already? </p> <p>Miller wakes everybody up by absolutely smashing a loose ball past Almunia, but he was a yard or so offside. Pow. Now do it again when it counts.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>59 mins:</strong> Bendtner has done absolutely nothing out there. If he's a top class striker then I'm the missing link in the Team GB 4X400 relay team. Incidentally - breaking news - Justin Hoyte has just signed for Boro for \u00a33.5m. Does that seem like a lot?</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>62 mins:</strong> Clichy does brilliantly to skip to the bye-line, incredible pace, but his cut-back is taken away from Walcott by an excellent challenge from Morrison. A bit more penetrative, that. More old school quick-passing Arsenal.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>65 mins:</strong> Eboue again shoots from miles out and again it's screwed miles wide. He hasn't scored in the Premier League. Hmmm. No real surprise that.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>66 mins:</strong> Adebayor turns well and carries the ball forward, lays it off to Walcott, but again the shot is blocked. Plenty of attack from Arsenal but it's all a bit ponderous to be honest. Not like them. Credit to West Brom, who have defended with great energy. But take away the early goal and it's all a bit powder puff...</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>70 mins:</strong> Walcott sticks it in from six yards. But he's offside by a mile. First change. Cech off, Macdonald on. Van Persie could be coming on too. Yes, here he is. Apparently suffering from \"a little bit of stiffness\". He's on for the anonymous Bendtner.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>72 mins:</strong> <br>Now Walcott's off and Toure on. At least that gets Eboue out to the flank and away from the goal. Djourou could be shifting into the middle. Not necessarily a move designed to beef up the creative engine. </p> <p>Derek Ansell says \"Justin Hoyte is a great English talent\". Get out of it. Nice enough chap. But, you know...</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>74 mins:</strong> No, Toure's gone into central midfield. Miller's last act is to once again muscle Djourou out of the way near goal, but his lay back is wasted by Hoefkens. Bednar comes on for the big man, who's had a decent game up top.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>76 mins:</strong> Bednar looking lively as he teases Sagna and lays it back to Kim. His shot is blocked by Gallas. West Brom, against all odds, still very much in this one. Arsenal have waffled and meandered their way through this second half. It could come back to bite them (although it probably won't)</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>79 mins:</strong> Eboue makes a run down the left and hammers in another shot that Brunt blocks. The unmarked Adebayor gives him an old fashioned look. </p> <p>Craig Beattie comes on for Chris Brunt. Another body up front.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>81 mins:</strong> Adebayor played in by Clichy down the left. His flighted cross is headed straight at Carson by Van Persie. Ah ha. and that's the first save Carson has had to make this half. Not a great stat for a team that's had pretty much all the ball - and spent most of that time doing nice little tippety-tappety things with it.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>83 mins:</strong> Bednar heads just wide, but he's offside. Murmurs of discontent around the Emirates. Big William Gallas yells at someone and does a bit of pointing. Yep. that'll fix it.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>85 mins:</strong> West Brom corner bounces awkwardly in the Arsenal box. Quick break suggests something might be on at the other end but again West Brom are back quickly. Good day for Mowbray this. His team have stuck at his defensive masterplan.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>87 mins:</strong> Adebayor again gets to the bye-line and sticks in a teasing little cross along the six-yard box. Van Persie can't get on it. Moments later Van Persie turns brilliantly and bends one just wide inside the box. That would have been a peach.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>89 mins:</strong> Adebayor still trying to pick his way past the entire West Brom defence (at least twice in any attack). Crowded out again. He's giving it his all, the big man, but Arsenal will need to play with a little more pace and verve in attack. This has been oddly pallid and bloodless.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>90 mins:</strong> No yellow cards yet. <br>Respect. It's all about respect. <br>Three mins of over time.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>93 mins: And that's full time.</strong> <br>Oddly, West Brom ended the match on the attack here. Not a bad start in the Premier League for them. Barnett had a good game at the back and Miller and Kim will score goals against weaker teams. </p> <p>Arsenal will be happy with the points but that was a bit of a limp second half. Nothing like the joyful Harlem Globetrotter attacking free-for-all of last year. Still, plenty of key players to come back for them. </p> <p>And that's all from me for now. Thanks for reading.</p>",

Can she do it again?</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>3.18am: </strong> Mansfield's finest has made a good start, she's level with the Romanian, Potec. And both are way in front of the world record line.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>3.20am: </strong><strong>Michael Phelps</strong> I still can't believe that man. Seven gold medals and a world record.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>3.22am: </strong>GOLD <strong>Rebecca Adlington</strong> has absolutely destroyed the field to win her second gold medal. She's also beaten Janet Evans' longstanding world record by over TWO SECONDS. What an amazing amazing swim.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>3.25am: </strong>Unluckily for Brits in America NBC switched to a commercial break in the middle of the <strong>women's 800m freestyle</strong>.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>3.28am: </strong>This is what the Olympics are about tears and gold medals. The BBC commentary team are overwhelmed.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>3.32am: </strong>Phew. Time to catch my breath and give you some <strong>hockey</strong> results. The US women beat the Kiwis 4-1.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>3.34am: </strong> Valeriy Borchin has shuffled his way to the gold medal in the <strong>men's 20km walk</strong>. He looks suitably sweaty.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>3.36am: </strong><strong>Heptathlon</strong> Not a great jump for Kelly Sotherton, 6.21m, some way down on her personal best.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>3.38am: </strong><strong>Men's 50m freestyle final</strong> Cielo Filho has produced a bit of an upset to claim the gold medal. He's understandably elated, splashing water all over the place.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>3.45am:</strong> Plenty of emails in support of Rebecca Adlington. Ben Tymens hates swimming and he even stayed up to watch it.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>3.47am: </strong>Cesar Cielo Filho's achievement shouldn't be underrated, the man beat Alain Bernard of France, the 100m freestyle champion, world champion Ben Wildman-Tobriner of the United States and Aussie Eamon Sullivan, the world record-holder. What a swim.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>3.55am: </strong><strong>Women's 100m</strong> Superb run from Jeanette Kwakye she finished second in her heat and qualifies for the next round.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>3.58am: </strong>The sprinter from Grenada isn't very happy. She's fidgeting like a stroppy toddler. It's only the Olympics calm down!</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>4.01am: </strong><strong>Women's 100m</strong> Lauryn Williams eases through the heat.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>4.05am: </strong>There she is, our new sporting hero Rebecca Adlington. She stands there proud as punch. Everyone who's up at this crazy hour, sing with me.....\"God save our gracious........................\"</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>4.11am: </strong>After Kirsty Coventry won three medals in Athens a number of Zimbabwean babies were called Kirsty, with the middle name Coventry, to honour he achievement. I wonder if they'll be a glut of Adlington's at Mansfield District Hospital.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>4.19am: </strong>Something I forgot to mention, Iraqi athlete Dana Abdulrazak finished sixth in her <strong>100m heat</strong>. The Iraqis almost didn't make it so it's great to see her competing.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>4.25am: </strong><strong> Women's 100m</strong> Disappointment. Laura Turner finishes fourth in her heat. She'll have to wait to see if shes a fastest loser. Crammy said she should have done better.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>4.29am: </strong>It's not looking good for our Kelly. All her competitors are cranking out PBs and she's treading water. 6.33m in the <strong>long jump </strong>isn't great at this stage.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>4.33am: </strong>Montell Douglas is the second British female sprinter definietly through. She looked very nervous, but she's through, and that's the important thing.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>4.38am: </strong><strong>BREAKING NEWS</strong> Serbia have launched an official protest over the result of the men's 100m butterfly. Michael Phelps' seventh gold medal is now in a bit of doubt. \"We have made an official protest. It's first place, it is very important,\" Serbia's deputy chef de mission Branislav Jevtic told Reuters. Watch this space for more news......</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>4.47am: </strong>Another lacklustre jump from Sotherton, she now lies fifth and surely a medal is now out of reach.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>4.50am: </strong>More <strong>breaking news</strong>. No wind at the sailing venue, so the medals may get delayed until tomorrow. That ruins my chances of commentating on a Ben Ainslie triumph.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>4.55am: </strong>Laura Turner is out. She won't go through as a fastest loser.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>5.01am: </strong>OK we can all calm down now, Serbia's appeal over Michael Phelp's 100m Butterfly has been denied by FINA. According to Jim Graham, NBC had covered the protest about an hour ago. OK thats USA 1 GB 0.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>5.08am: </strong> <strong>Swimming </strong>\"It was very clear there was no doubt whatsoever that first arrival was Michael Phelps,\" FINA executive director Cornel Marculescu told reporters after a review of the race, which the American won by 0.01 second.<br>\"The Serbs were satisfied and agree with the comments of the referee.\"</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>5.09am: </strong><strong>Women's 400m</strong> The heats are about to get underway. Both Christine Ohuruogu and Nicola Sanders are in with a chance of a medal.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>5.13am: </strong><strong>Women's 400m </strong>Potential shock. Deedee Trotter ambled round the track, eventually finishing fourth. She may sneak through as a fastest loser.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>5.19am: </strong><strong>Badminton</strong> Maria Kristin Yulianti of Indonesia beat Lu Lan of China 11-21 21-13 21-15</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>5.21am: </strong>More bad news for China, Zhang Penghui has been disqualified from the Olympic <strong>men's 25m rapid fire pistol</strong> competition. The reason: he raised his arm to much on three occasions.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>5.27am: </strong><strong>Women's 400m </strong>Lee McConnell qualifies for the next round. She made it look very easy, a nice relaxed run.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>5.28am: </strong>Elena Isinbaeva makes <strong>Pole Vaulting</strong> look so easy; I'm even thinking about limbering up for London 2012. Meanwhile, Kate Dennison wasn't so impressive she failed to get over 4.50m, but that's her best outdoors this season.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>5.32am: </strong><strong>Women's 400m</strong> Christine Ohuruogu ran-down Yulia Gushchina to win her heat very easily.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>5.35am: </strong>I need some verification on a bit of pub quiz trivia. Is it true that the <strong>discus</strong> is the only event where the women's world record is better than the men's? Answers on a postcard please.....</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>5.40am: </strong>You know I mentioned the <strong>men's 25m rapid fire pistol</strong> well it's been won by Oleksandr Petriv (Ukraine) who scored 780.2 points.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>5.42am: </strong><strong>Sanya Richards</strong> is looking in ominous form. Don't forget she missed the World Championships last year. She made that race look like a gentle jog around Finsbury Park. No problems for <strong>Nicola Sanders</strong> either. Job done for the GB girls.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>5.49am: </strong>So my discus factoid is half true. Jim Graham says: \"The women's discuss is 1 kilo, compared to the men's, which is 2 kilos. The men's discuss is also bigger in circumference. So, the records really have no relation to one another.\"</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>5.53am: </strong>I can't believe it, with all the excitement in the pool and on the track I've totally forgotten about the <strong>softball</strong>. Japan v China and USA v Chinese Taipei. What the heck has happened? Also if anyone is watching any of the so-called \"smaller sports\" that the Beeb deems not worthy of coverage let me know.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>6.00am: </strong> It's been a big big morning. Here's what you missed out on. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/16/olympics2008.olympicsaquatics3\">Brilliant Adlington wins second gold</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/16/olympics2008.olympicsaquatics2\">Phelps wins seventh gold of the Beijing Games... just</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/16/olympics2008.olympicsathletics3\">Sotherton falls to fifth after failing to take off in the long jump</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/16/athletics.christineohuruogu\">British trio cruise through 400m opening round</a> and the '<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/aug/16/olympicsandthemedia.spain\">Affectionate gesture' that sparked a global storm</a>.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>6.08am: </strong> Our friend Andrew Jolley has come up with the goods again. Apparently Japan are beating China 3-0 in the softball and, for good measure, he's thrown in a volleyball score, Serbia are one set up and are also leading Germany 10-6 in the second.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>6.14am: </strong><strong>Softball </strong>update, Jim Graham says the USA are now 5-0 up against Chinese Taipei.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>6.27am: </strong>Andrew Jolley says: \"Japan did beat China in the softball 3-0, and Serbia have just taken the second set 27-25 against Germany in the best of 3 contest. It being 20 degrees in the middle of winter here in Brisbane, I'm off to get an ice-cream.\"<br><em>I want some ice-cream, although i'd probably settle for coffee and toast.</em></p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>6.30am: </strong>We're all missing a trick here, everyone one of us should have tuned in the trampolining. I didn't even realise it was an Olympic event. Apparently the athletes were stunned by the size of the crowd: \"We don't get anything like this at home,\" said Canada's Rosannagh MacLennan.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>6.35am:</strong> If beeb commentator Andy Jameson had his way, instead of shaking hands, we'd all go around saluting each other. I lost count of the times he demanded we all raise three fingers to our cranium during Rebecca Adlington's gold medal swim.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>6.38am: </strong>Never accuse me of not having my finger on the Olympic pulse. Australia have just beaten European Champions Russia in the men's basketball. The Russians could possibly be heading out of the competition. Bit of a shock. (Thanks Joanna).</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>6.46am: </strong> Bit of Brit interest for all <strong>flyweight</strong> Khalid Yafai takes on Andris Hernandez Laffita. Guess where he's from: Cuba. Oh dear that means he's bound to be good.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>6.49am: </strong> News from water polo. Germany have edged past Italy 8-7 and the USA have beaten Croatia 7-5. Did anybody watch? Were they good, bad or indifferent?</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>6.54am: </strong> Andrew Jolley knows the Guardian website better than me, he's just pointed out this excellent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/interactive/2008/aug/16/beijingolympics2008\">guide to trampolining</a>.</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>6.59am: </strong><strong> Boxing</strong>Khalid Yafai is getting a bit of a boxing lesson at the hands of the Cuban. How do they keep turning out such great fighters? Castro must be putting something in the water.</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>7.01am: </strong><strong>Boxing </strong>Khalid Yafai has been beaten 9-3 by Andris Hernandez Laffita, another one of our boxers bites the dust.</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>7.02am: </strong>Today isn't just Super Saturday at the Olympics, it's also the start of the Premiership season, and on that note, David Bartram says: \"Thank god the Premier League starts today. I've had enough of watching sportsmen from obscure nations outshining Brits. Oh wait...\"</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>7.07am: </strong><strong>Shooting </strong>Bad news for anyone thing of taking up the <strong>25-meter rapid-fire pistol</strong> for London 2012. Silver medalist Ralf Schumann won't be retiring any time soon. \"I will go to London (for the 2012 Olympics),\" he said. Schumann finished second behind Oleksandr Petriv of Ukraine.</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>7.12am: </strong><strong>Injury update</strong> Germany defender Linda Bresonik is out of the Olympics after she tore an ankle ligament in the team's quarterfinal victory over Norway.</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>7.15am: </strong><strong>Basketball</strong> Poor old Angola, Ioannis Bourousis scored 22 points as Greece thrashed them 102-61. They look to be on their way out.</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>7.20am: </strong><strong>Another Chinese gold medal</strong> Defending champion Zhang Ning of China won the gold medal in women's singles in the Olympic badminton tournament Saturday, defeating team-mate Xie Xingfang in three sets. She won 21-12, 10-21, 21-18.</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>7.26am: </strong>Right that's me checking out of this mad house. Paolo Bandini is going to take you through the next few hours of action that will include: sailing, rowing and possibly some tennis. Right adios.</p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p><strong>7.33am:</strong> Hello. I'm watching a couple of <strong>very slow sailboats</strong> bobbing along gently on the water outside Qingdao. Ben Ainslie is apparently doing an \"excellent\" job of marking his only rival for the gold medal - America's Zach Railey. Which as far as I can discern means getting in Railey's way and copying <em>absolutely everything</em> he does. Ainslie needs to finish within six places of Railey to win gold, which doesn't look like it's going to be a problem, though it's early doors yet.</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>7.38am:</strong> Let's look at the agenda for the next few hours, then, and it seems like I may have arrived just in time for ... er ... a bit of a lull. Ainslie is going now, of course, but other than him, there's no British medal chasing till 8.50am BST, when Alan Campbell is in the final of the men's single sculls. Lots of rowing finals in quick succession after that though, with the women's pair, women's double sculls, men's double sculls and men's coxless four all to be decided. We've also got James Degale up in the boxing at 9.15am, then the cycling gets going, with Chris Newton in the men's points race final at 10.40am and Bradley Wiggins chasing gold in the individual pursuit an hour and a quarter later.</p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>7.44am:</strong> \"It's golden Saturday,\" yelps a slightly overexcited Clare Balding as Ainslie maintains his comfortable domination of America's Railey in the Finn Class <strong>sailing</strong>. In the meantime let me know which you are most excited about out of the men's basketball preliminary between Croatia and Lithuania, the men's handball preliminary between France and Spain or the men's table tennis semi-final between Japan and Germany and I'll try to give you some bonus updates*.</p> <p>* theguardian.com reserves the right to ignore your views.</p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p><strong>7.51am:</strong> Gary Naylor's here, and he's quoting me. \"You say 'Ainslie needs to finish within six places of Railey to win gold, which doesn't look like it's going to be a problem' (7.33am). Do you mean it will be 'plain sailing'?\" You're better than that Gary.</p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>7.55am:</strong> Am I the only one who's marginally uncomfortable about the BBC's repeated insistence on referring to this as a \"golden day\" for Britain? I mean I do realise that the one medal we've won already is above par, and we <em>probably</em> will win a bunch more, but <em>really</em> - are we cocky enough about anything Olympic related to take winning medals for granted?</p> <!-- Block 80 --> <p><strong>7.59am:</strong> \"Dramatic scenes!\" scream our commentary team as they cut to LIVE images of a small boat not moving. Apparently the Finn class medal race has been abandoned due to a lack of wind, meaning Ainslie, who basically had the gold in hand, now has to do it all over again. It could be later today, or it could be even later than that, depending on the weather.</p> <!-- Block 81 --> <p><strong>8.03am:</strong> This really isn't what I was asking for (at 7.44am) but Andrew Jolly seems intent on doing my job for me. \"I can cover the Lithuania v Croatia basketball and Australia v Holland in the women's hockey as that's all there is on offer on Australian TV this afternoon,\" he chimes. \"It's 1-1 in the hockey at the start of the 2nd half and Croatia 23-17 Lithuania in the basketball.\"</p> <!-- Block 82 --> <p><strong>8.11am: It's a Golden Day!</strong> Nobody's won anything in the last eight minutes, but let's be honest, I was wrong at 7.44am, <strong>it is a golden day</strong> for Britain. We've been discussing this in the office, and we feel it may be necessary to play a little jingle every time Britain win gold. BBC's idents are already wearisome, while the national anthem and Spandau Ballet's Gold seem too obvious. Any other suggestions?</p> <!-- Block 83 --> <p><strong>8.15am:</strong> \"I thought it was a golden day for Britain due to Hull City's first appearance in top flight football,\" pipes up Oliver Pattenden, moderately humorously.</p> <!-- Block 84 --> <p><strong>8.18am: rowing</strong> More good news for Britain - there's a lurgy going round the rowing regatta, and among the afflicted is German rower Marco Neumann, who has been forced to withdraw from the final of the men's four. Given that they Germany were among the favourites, this can <em>only</em> mean more gold for Britain. Probably.</p> <!-- Block 85 --> <p><strong>8.23am</strong> \"Yup, talking up the Golden Day can only end in tears,\" reckons Andrew Jolly. \"I know this because there have been a whole host of Australian swimmers who were meant to 'cruise home' in gold. They've been performing quite under par, which is of course, amusing, and provides me and others with much ammo for the office. They are of course, still miles ahead in the table.\" Pah - they're only one gold ahead. We'll be in front before elevenses ...</p> <!-- Block 86 --> <p><strong>8.26am: sailing</strong> The guardian's man in Qingdao Steve Bierley says there's still some prospect of more wind later today, so there's a decent chance Ben Ainslie will get another shot at tying up his gold this afternoon.</p> <!-- Block 87 --> <p><strong>8.31am:</strong> New Zealand-based British rowing enthusiast Joanne Harris has more good news for team GB ... \"TVNZ is also treating today as a possible golden day, because there's the rowing and the cycling and Valerie Vili appears to be on good form in the shot put,\" she says. \"Basically NZ is now desperate to get on the medals table full stop. But Mahe Drysdale's got a funny tummy and is dehydrated, so that might not help the chances and Vili's the best bet at the moment.\" Drysdale's got a dicky tummy too, eh? That pretty much <em>guarantees</em> Britain's Alan Campbell gold in the men's single sculls.</p> <!-- Block 88 --> <p><strong>8.35am:</strong> \"But what happened in the <strong>trampolining</strong>,\" demands Frances Bentley. Britain's Claire Wright failed to qualify for the final of the women's competition, that's what.</p> <!-- Block 89 --> <p><strong>8.42am:</strong> Enough dawdling, it's time for facts. <br>\u2022Fact No1: The United States have whupped Taiwan 7-0 in a rounders preliminary.<br>\u2022Fact No2: Holland have crushed Australia 2-1 in the women's hockey. \"Apparently it was the crowd's fault,\" relays Andrew Jolly.<br>\u2022Fact No3: Rebecca Adlington is going to get an open-top bus tour around Mansfield to celebrate her two gold medals when she gets home. \"She has raised the profile of Mansfield and provides inspiration for other youngsters in the town,\" hurrahed the Mayor of Mansfield, Tony Egginton.<br>\u2022Fact No4: You really should read <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/16/do_we_really_have_to_learn_les.html\">Barney Ronay's blog asking whether we really need to learn lessons</a>, because it's rather good.</p> <!-- Block 90 --> <p><strong>8.48am:</strong> The men's single sculls is literally just 120 seconds away. I've just been informed that Lawrence Donegan will be blogging live from the Bird's Nest on all the big athletics - including the men's 100m final - from 1pm BST.</p> <!-- Block 91 --> <p><strong>8.51am: Whinging ... erm ... Kiwis</strong> There's been a delay after Drysdale complained that there was weed in his lane and it had to be removed.</p> <!-- Block 92 --> <p><strong>8.53am:</strong> Campbell's started well and is in the lead after 500m, Tim Meyens of Belgium is second ...</p> <!-- Block 93 --> <p><strong>8.55am:</strong> ... Campbell's down to second after 1000m though - Olympic champion and favourite Olaf Tufte, from Norway, has taken first ...</p> <!-- Block 94 --> <p><strong>8.57am:</strong> ... But it's Drysdale who leads after 1500m - he's setting a serious pace now and is almost a whole length clear of Tufte in second. Campbell is barely clinging onto third ...</p> <!-- Block 95 --> <p><strong>8.58am:</strong> ... Yeah, Campbell's miles off the pace by the end and nowhere near the medals. His collapse was somewhat overshadowed by Drysdale, though, who seemed to go to pieces in the final 100m, when he went from leading comfortably to only just sneaking third. Tufte, who upped his stroke rate dramatically down the stretch, retains his Olympic title, while the Czech Republic's Ondrej Synek, who rowed a very patient race before also pushing on late, takes silver.</p> <!-- Block 96 --> <p><strong>9.02am: skeet shooting</strong> In amidst all that rowing excitement, I'm afraid I missed Vincent Hancock winning gold in the men's skeet shooting. Norway's Tore Brovold takes silver, and if I understand the official Beijing website right, then France's Anthony Terras got bronze.</p> <!-- Block 97 --> <p><strong>9.05am:</strong> \"Lithuania beat Croatia 86-73,\" relays Andrew Jolly. \"I don't normally like basketball, but I'll concede that this was quite good. The water polo, on the other hand, is utterly ridiculous as a spectator sport, just a load of hairy men splashing and spluttering all over the place.\"</p> <!-- Block 98 --> <p><strong>9.10am:</strong> \"Can we not be too hard on Alan Campbell,\" implores Joanne Harris as the women's pair get ready to go. \"He had a knee infection not that long ago and to reach the final was an achievement - also, Britain hasn't had a decent single sculler for quite some time, and Campbell's the baby of the men's singles field at the moment. He actually is a real prospect for 2012, as rowers can go on for some time (evidence: Steve Redgrave!)\" Indeed, quite an infection Joanne - he missed six weeks of training in the build-up to this Olympics. Joanne also rightly points out that Drysdale has had to receive treatment after collapsing in his boat.</p> <!-- Block 99 --> <p><strong>9.12am:</strong> You were probably hoping for some more <strong>rowing</strong> news here, but you're getting <strong>sailing</strong> instead. Sadly both Ben Ainslie and the Yngling girls will now have to wait for tomorrow for their tilt at gold, as it's all been called off for the day due to adverse weather conditions. Sailing, incidentally, must be the only sport in the world where a total absence of wind constitutes \"adverse weather conditions\".</p> <!-- Block 100 --> <p><strong>9.15am:</strong> Britain's Louisa Reeve and Olivia Whitlam are pootling along in fifth at the half-way mark of the women's pair. To be fair they were never expected to do much here ...</p> <!-- Block 101 --> <p><strong>9.20am:</strong> Reeve and Whitlam just about sneak past the support tugboat on the line, but only because it stopped. A comfortable last place for Britain, with Romania's Georgeta Andrunache and Viorica Susanu taking gold, and China's You Wu and Yulan Gao putting in a huge effort to power past Belarus's Yuliya Bichyk and Natallia Helakh for silver with less than 50m to go.</p> <!-- Block 102 --> <p><strong>9.27am:</strong> Australia has beaten Russia 95-80 in the men's basketball. That's the sort of news you came here to hear.</p> <!-- Block 103 --> <p><strong>9.30am: cycling</strong> Steven Burke is up against Ukraine's Volodymyr Dyudya in the first round of the men's individual pursuit ...</p> <!-- Block 104 --> <p><strong>9.32am: cycling</strong> ... and so far he's getting hammered. Dyudya's about two and a half seconds ahead ...</p> <!-- Block 105 --> <p><strong>9.34am: cycling</strong> ... but Burke comes storming back - the gap's down to just over 0.1sec with one lap to go ...</p> <!-- Block 106 --> <p><strong>9.35am: cycling</strong> ... and Burke's through to the last four with what I'm told is a personal best time. Brilliant stuff, and if Bradley Wiggins can do the same in his heat against Alexander Serov shortly, then Britain will be guaranteed at least one medal in the competition ...</p> <!-- Block 107 --> <p><strong>9.39am:</strong> Debra Lee has composed a gold medal jingle to go with Team GB's <strong>golden day (number of gold medals won so far: 1)</strong>. \"Bill Withers may be 80 but I'm sure he's up for re-recording Lovely Day with revised lyrics,\" she offers - before launching into song: <br>\"Then I check results and the world's alright with me<br>Just who's won the gold, oh, I see it's Team GB -<br>A golden daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay<br>(Golden day, golden day, golden day, golden)<br>A golden daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay\"</p> <!-- Block 108 --> <p><strong>9.42am:</strong> I've just had a request for an update on that men's table tennis, and I can tell you that Germany are currently 2-1 up in matches against Japan, with Christian Suss beating Yo Kan 1-0 in games and 8-5 in the second game of the fourth match as I type.</p> <!-- Block 109 --> <p><strong>9.47am: rowing</strong> Australia's Drew Ginn and Duncan Free have taken gold in the men's coxless pair. There were no Brits in the final, so no more crushing disappointment just yet.</p> <!-- Block 110 --> <p><strong>9.47am: boxing</strong> James Degale is through to the quarter-finals of the men's middleweight tournament after beating USA's Shawn Estrada 11-5 on points. He'll face Kazakhstan's Bakhtiyar Artayev next.</p> <!-- Block 111 --> <p><strong>9.52am: rowing</strong> And now we have Elise Laverick and Anna Bebington in the final of the women's double sculls. They're fourth and three seconds back on leaders Germany at the half-way mark. In fact they're apparently in \"fourth medal\" position according to the Beeb's commentators. What do we reckon that particular medal's made of, cheese (hard variety)?</p> <!-- Block 112 --> <p><strong>9.57am: rowing</strong> ... the girls are still three seconds back but now third at the 1,500m mark ...</p> <!-- Block 113 --> <p><strong>9.59am: rowing</strong> ... Aah - a frustrating <strong>bronze medal</strong> for Britain in the end - they battled right back into it, and had the race gone on another 50m probably would have won, but in the end were only about three feet back of Germany and New Zealand, who crossed the line at almost exactly the same moment. As yet we still don't know who actually won as it was too tight to call ...</p> <!-- Block 114 --> <p><strong>10.01am: rowing</strong> New Zealand's Georgina and Caroline Evers-Swindell are deemed to have won by a hundredth of a second, meaning their first gold of the Games.</p> <!-- Block 115 --> <p><strong>10.04am: cycling</strong> Meanwhile, Bradley Wiggins has beaten Serov in the individual pursuit. His time was the fastest in any of the four heats, so he will face New Zealand's Hayden Roulston, whose heat time was three seconds slower than his own, in the heats. Wiggins was 12-1 on favourite before this morning and he should fancy his chances now. Steven Burke's time was the third-fastest in the end, so he will face Russia's Alexei Markov in the bronze medal race.</p> <!-- Block 116 --> <p><strong>10.06am: cycling</strong> Chris Hoy has cruised through his heat in the men's keirin.</p> <!-- Block 117 --> <p><strong>10.10am: rowing</strong> We're back at the Shunyi rowing lake, where Matthew Wells and Stephen Rowbotham have a reasonable shot for gold in the men's double sculls</p> <!-- Block 118 --> <p><strong>10.13am: rowing</strong> are second at the half-way mark, but Australia are pulling away and have already created clear water between themselves and the British crew ...</p> <!-- Block 119 --> <p><strong>10.15am: rowing</strong> ... Australia's still have a gap of over two and a half seconds at 1,500m and I'd the Brits are looking more likely to lose silver - probably to Estonia - than gain gold ...</p> <!-- Block 120 --> <p><strong>10.17am: rowing</strong> ... They say second place is first loser, which would make our crew second losers, I guess, as they are overhauled by Estonia right on the line. Yup, the golden day is going much as we expected.</p> <!-- Block 121 --> <p><strong>10.24am:</strong> \"So far the only golds the Aussies have won have been in the swimming and rowing,\" points out Bob O'Hara. \"It's almost as if they're desperately trying to get off their large island ... I hope they don't discover sailing.\" Meanwhile Britain's Ross Edgar has qualified from his heat in the men's <strong>keirin</strong>.</p> <!-- Block 122 --> <p><strong>10.30am:</strong> \"Bolt's going to run 9.5sec today,\" insists my colleague James Dart and 100m chitter-chatter has been dominating the desk all morning. Personally I still believe Tyrone Edgar's in with a shout*.</p> <p>* I do NOT believe this.</p> <!-- Block 123 --> <p><strong>10.32am: rowing</strong> Right then, one last crack at gold on the Shunyi lake. Great Britain are second at the 500m mark in the men's fours ...</p> <!-- Block 124 --> <p><strong>10.34am: rowing</strong> ... Team GB are third and about 1.4sec behind Australia at the half-way point. This is where Britain would expect to start kicking on ...</p> <!-- Block 125 --> <p><strong>10.35am: rowing</strong> ... still second at the 1,500m mark but the gap isn't closing so far ...</p> <!-- Block 126 --> <p><strong>10.37am: rowing</strong> GOLD FOR BRITAIN! Raise your glasses, do a dance, play a jingle - Debra Lee's at 9.39am will do - the <strong>golden day</strong> is finally back on as Tom James, Andy Hodge, Pete Reed and Steve Williams heave their way past the Australians with 100m to spare.</p> <!-- Block 127 --> <p><strong>10.41am: rowing</strong> Take that Russia! A fifth gold medal elevates Britain in the table from lowly ninth to a lofty eighth, leaving the Russians trailing in their wake. \"What's impressive is how the rowing coaches ride bikes along the towpath to observe the crews,\" parps Gary Naylor,\" yet, despite being close together and staring at boats and stopwatches instead of the road ahead, never collide nor, alas, ride into the lake.\" Those riders came up last time I was on MBM duty too, and I think we established there are some fans in that mix too - apparently they've been hiring out bikes for free by the rowing lake. Which I guess isn't so much hiring them out as giving them away, when you think about it.</p> <!-- Block 128 --> <p><strong>10.48am</strong> How long does it take to give out a medal? Wells and Rowbotham are only just getting theirs, and they finished half an hour ago.</p> <!-- Block 129 --> <p><strong>10.50am: cycling</strong> OK, maybe I can stop being facetious about the gold rush now - we've got an all-British final coming up in the women's 3000m individual pursuit after Wendy Houvenaghel and Rebecca Romero posted the two fastest times in the heats.</p> <!-- Block 130 --> <p><strong>10.58am: cycling</strong> A few of you have emailed in to express concerns over the moped that leads the cyclists out on the first few laps of the keirin. Gary Naylor reminds us of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbwYLaJo0zs\">Alan Partridge's stringent views on this sort of cheating</a>.</p> <!-- Block 131 --> <p><strong>11.08am: cycling</strong> Right, we've got the men's points race starting any moment now, where Britain's Chris Newton is up for a medal, but in the meantime I have <strong>huge news from the men's team table tennis</strong>, where Germany are through to the final after beating Japan 3-2. Judging by the footage on Eurosport, they're pretty happy about it too.</p> <!-- Block 132 --> <p><strong>11.13am:</strong> Brazil just kicked off against Cameroon in the quarter-finals of the <strong>men's football</strong> and likewise Italy against Belgium. No goals in either as yet.</p> <!-- Block 133 --> <p><strong>11.16am: cycling</strong> \"Good luck with the points race,\" offers Gary Naylor. \"I've watched a lot of bike racing, but I still have no idea what's happening.\" Oh, it's perfectly straightforward Gary. Basically they all pedal round this here velodrome, and they get points for ... er ... yes. America's Bobby Lea just did a full lap more than everyone and rejoined the main group, and therefore has 25 points. Britain's Chris Newton has two. Just 133 laps to go.</p> <!-- Block 134 --> <p><strong>11.21am: tennis</strong> The Williams sisters are a set down to the Ukraine's Bondarenko sisters in the women's doubles, but 4-2 up in the second set. Russia's Dinara Safina, meanwhile, has beaten China's Na Li in the women's singles, and will face compatriot Elena Dementieva, who beat another Russian - Vera Zvonareva - in the other semi-final.</p> <!-- Block 135 --> <p><strong>11.28am: cycling</strong> Yup, just 100 laps to go in the points race and \"it's going to be very close\". This seems as good a time as any to make my excuses and leave, so here's Taimour Lay to carry you through to 1pm, after which Lawrence Donegan will be blogging live from the Bird's Nest. Thanks for all your emails.</p> <!-- Block 136 --> <p><strong>11.33am:</strong> Right, that's quite enough of Bandini's knee-jerk patriotism. Here's to an afternoon of British underachievement and detached cynicism.</p> <p>By the way, the men's points race is continuing on its merrily incomprehensible way. A shiny penny to anyone who emails in to explain the rules.</p> <!-- Block 137 --> <p><strong>11.36am: Football</strong> Exciting things are happening in the quarter-final between Italy and Belgium. But I only know what John in Singapore tells me: ''It's now 1-1 with Belgium down to ten men after giving away a penalty. Italy scored to make it 1-0 but then belgium equalised with a very, very controversial header from a corner. It was cleared off the line but the ref said it went over. Very dodgy indeed.''</p> <p>Back to the compelling cycling on the BBC! Only 60 laps to go...</p> <!-- Block 138 --> <p><strong>11.39am:</strong> Roy Keane emails from New Zealand with a not unreasonable question which I, erm, can't answer. ''How does a rider end up in negative points in this men's points race?'' Anyone?</p> <!-- Block 139 --> <p><strong>11.41am: Team GB Cycling</strong> Chris Newton is in a bronze medal position with 40-odd laps left. That much I know.</p> <!-- Block 140 --> <p><strong>11.43am: Things coming up </strong> Steven Burke is on next in the men's 4000m individual pursuit bronze medal race, with Bradley Wiggins in the gold race afterwards.</p> <p>The keirin second round, with Chris Hoy, is after the points race with the final at 12.20pm.</p> <p>The javelin round of the <strong>heptathlon</strong> starts at midday. Watch amazed as Kelly Sotherton sends the pointy stick <em>backwards</em> into the crowd.</p> <!-- Block 141 --> <p><strong>11.45am: </strong> <strong>The points race explained.</strong> Andrew Jolly wonders what all the fuss is about. ''It's pretty simple. There are a load of laps, every 10 laps there is a sprint, where they give 5 points for the bike across the line first, down to 1 for 5th. If you go all the way around and catch the back of the pack, you get 20 points. The bloke with the most points wins.'' </p> <p>And, Roy, here's an answer to the negative points question. Again, from Mr Jolly. ''You get 20 points taken away if you drop a lap from the leaders.''</p> <p>I feel pretty small right now.</p> <p>Meanwhile, <strong>Newton is in second! </strong>(check out that exclamation mark as my own knee-jerk patriotism kicks in.....)</p> <!-- Block 142 --> <p><strong>11.49am: Football Football Football </strong> Italy are getting STUFFED by Belgium. Well, not stuffed. But, read on:</p> <p>''The Belgians are in dreamland according to the commentator,'' says John in Singapore. ''And why not? They've just gone 2-1 up in injury time at the end of the first half. I won't pretend to know who scored, mind you.''</p> <p>I have the full weight of the Guardian sports department behind me. I'll find that Belgian scorer.</p> <!-- Block 143 --> <p><strong>11.50am: None of us know the scorer.</strong></p> <!-- Block 144 --> <p><strong>11.53am: </strong>Former Bluebells bassist Lawrence Donegan will be <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/16/athletics_live.html\">blogging live from the bird's nest</a> in Beijing from 1pm: follow all the athletics, including the men's 100m at 3.30pm.</p> <!-- Block 145 --> <p><strong>11.55am: Team GB Cycling Bronze to Chris Newton </strong> Fair enough.</p> <!-- Block 146 --> <p><strong>11.59am: Chinese Pop-aganda: </strong> Want to hear the Olympic song that is sending <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/16/cctv_quickly_wears_out_its_wel.html\">Marina Hyde around the Beijing bend</a>? </p> <p>Well, I played it (for research purposes, you understand) before work this morning, fully prepared to reject its saccharine manipulation, but then ended up humming it all the way to Farringdon, a spring in my step, the Olympic spirit coursing through my veins. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XbIZqg4v7w\">Try it if you dare. </a></p> <!-- Block 147 --> <p><strong>12.01pm: </strong>''The Belgian who scored was Kevin Mirallas!'' emails an excited Joanna Sutherland. We are a global village. And I am the idiot.</p> <!-- Block 148 --> <p><strong>12.04pm: Team GB Keirin</strong> Chris Hoy is into the final.</p> <!-- Block 149 --> <p><strong>12.07pm: </strong> Andy Bull gets all <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/16/time_for_new_heroes_as_british.html\">voyeuristic at the rowing.</a></p> <!-- Block 150 --> <p><strong>12.12pm: Sotherton watch</strong> Kelly starts her javelin. She's 22 points off bronze in the heptathlon. This is her worst event. And it's ... a no throw! At least, that's what I think a cross and a red flag indicate. Not a great beginning. Just hurl it! Any old way will do.</p> <!-- Block 151 --> <p><strong>12.15pm:</strong> Another email from Joanna who obviously has a laptop and a budding ambition to take all our jobs: ''I'm writing from the Basketball arena in Beijing and coming up next is China v Germany (whoever loses is out of the competition - the locals are VERY nervous) followed by USA (USA!) v world champions Spain. It's a biggie and the venue is full of bloody media!''</p> <!-- Block 152 --> <p><strong>12.17am: Team GB Keirin</strong> Ros Edgar makes the final too. Bandini can't control himself and bellows ''GB Gold rush!'' across the newsroom. <strong>Britain</strong>. Is. <strong>Great</strong>.</p> <!-- Block 153 --> <p><strong>12.19am: Football</strong> Brazil v Cameroon. ''It's 0-0, nearly 60 minutes gone and it's not a great game,'' reports Andrew Jolly. And Cameroon are down to 10 men.</p> <p>''Does anyone care about Italy v Belgium?'' asks Singapore John. ''If they do they might like to know Rossi, the fella that used to play for Man Utd, just got booked for diving in the box when the keeper clearly had enough of his ankle to make you think he was trying to rob his boots. I can imagine some serious whining from the Italians if they lose this.''</p> <p>Some-time Italian Paolo Bandini applauds the dive: ''A pragmatic solution to a hopeless situation.''</p> <!-- Block 154 --> <p><strong>12.23pm: Team GB </strong> Newton is on the podium for his bronze. Joan Llaneras of Spain got gold in that points race by the way.</p> <!-- Block 155 --> <p><strong>12.25pm: Tennis</strong> Novak Djokovic has won the first set 6-3 against James Blake. The winner takes the bronze medal.</p> <!-- Block 156 --> <p><strong>12.26pm:</strong> <strong>Sotherton throws a javelin!</strong> She made a celebratory gesture just now that suggests it went forwards - as is the aim of the discipline.</p> <!-- Block 157 --> <p><strong>12.28pm: Team GB Cycling</strong> It's the individual men's pursuit. Stephen Burke is up against Alexei Markov of Russia for the bronze medal.</p> <!-- Block 158 --> <p><strong>12.30pm: Team GB Burke </strong> Markov is ahead. The 20 year-old from Lancashire needs to, er, pump those legs faster so that the bike moves quicker and so on.</p> <!-- Block 159 --> <p><strong>12.32pm: Cycling </strong> Burke is go! He's ahead.</p> <p>In her <strong>800m semi-final</strong>, Marilyn Okoro finishes 6th. Will that be enough to qualify?</p> <!-- Block 160 --> <p><strong>12.34pm:</strong> <strong>Bronze rush!</strong> Stephen Burke has won it. 4.20.947 is the time.</p> <p>And Bradley Wiggins is next in the gold medal race against the Kiwi Hayden Roulston. They're off.</p> <!-- Block 161 --> <p><strong>12.40pm:</strong> Wiggins looks like he's going to win it. He's 2 seconds clear.</p> <!-- Block 162 --> <p><strong><strong>12.41pm:</strong> Team GB Gold Individual pursuit</strong> Belgian-born Wiggins is an Olympic winner once again.</p> <!-- Block 163 --> <p><strong>12.43pm: Team GB Athletics</strong> <strong>Rush of disappointment</strong> In the women's 800m semis, it looks like Marilyn Okoro's 6th place won't be enough to qualify for the final. In the second heat, Jenny Meadows also came sixth.</p> <!-- Block 164 --> <p><strong>12.45pm: Tennis</strong> In the battle of the siblings, Serena and Venus Williams are into the final of the women's doubles after beating Ukraine's Alona and Kateryna Bondarenko 4-6, 6-4, 6-1.</p> <!-- Block 165 --> <p><strong>12.47pm: Egad, I wish I was watching the football</strong> John fills us in: \"The Italians win a second penalty and, against Belgian's substitute<br>keeper, it's......scored by Rossi. 2-2 with 20 minutes to go. The ten of Italy men will not lie down! But then shocking keeping lets Dan Welly, or whatever he's called, score his second and it's 3-2 to Belgium. And the ref has sent off the Italian keeper. Miralis, the Belgian striker, ran off with the ball and then threw it behind him right into the keeper's head (tough to tell if he meant it or not) at which point the Italian keeper wrestled him to the ground and saw red. 10 minutes to go and it's a blinder!''</p> <!-- Block 166 --> <p><strong>12.52pm: The obligatory softball update</strong> ''Having still not seen any of TEAM GBGBGB (say it fast enough and you get Bee Gees) in action in the velodrome courtesy of Australian State Television, I thought you might like to know the Aussie women's softball team have just beaten the Dutch.'' Thanks to Michelle Houtman, who claims to be ''suffering in Sydney''. From excitement?</p> <!-- Block 167 --> <p><strong><strong>12.54pm: </strong> Football </strong> Jolly intriguing: Cameroon hang on for extra time with 10 men against Brazil.</p> <!-- Block 168 --> <p><strong>12.57pm: The English Premier League begins - the world yawns?</strong> ''I was wondering if there was any indication of the Chinese organisers trying to overcome the fact that now the Premiership has started the Olympics will wither on the vine over here,'' writes Tom Stone. ''I am sure someone is still watching it but a quick walk down the street and a few cheeky glances into people's front rooms suggests that the majority of Brixton at least would rather watch Mark Lawrenson and Lee Dixon bickering over who will be relegated come May.''</p> <p>I wouldn't attempt cheeky glances at strangers in Brixton, Tom. That's brought me a lot of trouble in the past...</p> <!-- Block 169 --> <p><strong>1.00pm:</strong> Sotherton's vigorous celebrations just before were for a 37.66m effort - a modest throw but at least she didn't impale herself.</p> <!-- Block 170 --> <p><strong>1.02pm: Team GB keirin </strong>Edgar and Hoy start the final. More medals up for grabs here.</p> <!-- Block 171 --> <p><strong>1.04pm: GB GOLD A-HOY! </strong> One lap to go. Hoy led from the front. Edgar sneaked through to third. And then second...</p> <p>And its gold to Hoy! My boss shouts ''Goldrush!'' Edgar takes silver! I feel moderately excited and I'm not afraid to admit it.</p> <!-- Block 172 --> <p><strong>1.10pm:</strong> And on that golden bombshell, that's it for this minute-by-minute report. But Lawrence Donegan is in Beijing - <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/16/athletics_live.html\">he's blogging on the athletics right now. </a> You can leave comments there, too.</p> <p>ps. Brazil are now 2-0 up in extra-time in their quarter-final against Cameroon.</p> <p>pps. Usain Bolt has just ambled/strolled/pretty much walked through his 100m semi in 9.85sec. </p> <p>ppps. Cheers for your workload-halving emails. Sorry I had to use them all...</p>"
