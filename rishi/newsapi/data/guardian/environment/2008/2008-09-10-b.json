  "<p>I head up RMJM, one of the world's biggest architecture firms. I'm not an architect, but I sure do look like one. I'm a white man approaching middle age and I've had a comfortable upbringing. Our industry, sadly, does not accurately reflect society in Britain today. It's not deliberate, but the profession is not inclusive - to be perfectly blunt, it's reminiscent of an exclusive old boys' club.</p> <p>RMJM employs more than 1,200 architects. We keep close tabs on talent coming through and I have to say there's a lot of sameness about the place. The built environment is at risk of becoming a very boring place where one design is much like another because one architect is much like another.</p> <p>Let me say from the outset we are not talking about the profession being inherently racist. That's not the case. The fact is it's relatively expensive to study architecture, making it more likely that students will come from professional family backgrounds. This, in turn means, there are a lack of non-white role models coming through the system.</p> <p>People tend to get an aspirational boost when they see someone else from their background who has already made it, so to speak. There are, of course, other society factors too that all amount to what is essentially a poverty of opportunity. There are other professions that are probably in the same situation, but that's not an excuse to not do something about it. </p> <p>We need to change: involve people in the design process through community consultation; encourage young people from across the spectrum to take an interest in architecture and possibly make a career of it; educate qualified architects about the world they live in and broaden their horizons at every opportunity.</p> <p>In practice at RMJM, this translates to five-day volunteering programmes for all our architects to head out into <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/communities\">communities</a> to assist in projects and spread the word about the profession. </p> <p>We have employed a dedicated project manager to work with the <a href=\"http://www.stephenlawrence.org.uk/content/view/61/101/\">Stephen Lawrence Trust</a> and we will be hosting a series of workshops in Britain's inner cities designed to attract young people and encourage them to explore their creativity. We'll also be partnering local colleges and community groups to maximise impact.</p> <p>And we will identify six talented young people to attend an eight-week introductory course at the prestigious Harvard University graduate school of design in the US, and then work with them as mentors through their university studies and employment as architects.</p> <p>It's not going to change things overnight, but it's a start. One, mind you, that has been industry-led and for a very good reason. The startling truth is we're facing a very real shortage of designers and, although there is a downturn in the construction industry in the UK at the moment, there are huge opportunities around the world and those aren't going to go away.</p> <p>A report from the OECD last year said infrastructure spending needed to be \u00a353,0000bn worldwide between now and 2030 as governments in developed countries perform much-needed upgrades to transport systems, and emerging markets industrialise.</p> <p>Our industry is in trouble. The supply chain for our most important resource - people - is in poor health. There are not enough people coming through, and what's coming through is mostly the same. It's not a good position to be in, 22 years out from 2030.</p> <p>We need to reach out today to kids from all backgrounds interested in becoming architects. We need new faces, new ideas, and new ways of looking at the world. The same old, same old is boring and come 2030, if not already, boring design will not close the deals on big projects. </p> <p>It takes seven years to train an architect - waiting another 10 years to take action is not an option. That's the business case for diversity. There are, of course, more compelling reasons for change.</p> <p>Architecture is often considered to be a social science, it has to do with people. If sections of society are excluded from architecture then we cannot hope to address their needs. One of the most basic human needs is shelter and without that people cannot possibly flourish and achieve their best. This underpins the importance of the built environment in supporting individuals and society.</p> <p>We need to incorporate a range of different perspectives and experiences in our masterplans and designs. How can people who've never lived in a troubled inner city area hope to regenerate it? It's easy, you employ architects who grew up in that environment, but the problem is there are hardly any. We need to break this paradigm of exclusion.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Peter Morrison is the chief executive of UK-based RMJM Architects, one of the world's biggest design firms. The firm is working with the Stephen Lawrence Centre to promote architecture as a realistic career goal for young people from black and ethnic minority backgrounds. RMJM-funded initiatives worth more than \u00a31m will be officially announced at the annual Stephen Lawrence Memorial Lecture to be delivered by designer Wayne Hemingway in London tonight</p>",
  "<p>The most important influence on videogame design now is not some hot sci-fi flick or wicked graphics effect. It is YouTube. While a DIY TV channel is taking over the planet, in the spirit of the DIY TV channel, the most exciting PS3, Wii and Xbox 360 releases are creative, cooperative experiences. Sure, map editors and level design tools have been given away with games for years, but these were always for the superhardcore. In the latest games, creativity is not just a central component - it more or less is the game. </p> <p>Sony is the leader at the moment. The PS3 version of SingStar allows players to video their performances and upload them to a dedicated site. Next month will see the long-awaited release of LittleBigPlanet, a truly beautiful platform adventure in which gamers work together to build new levels.</p> <p>It's not just Sony. Exploiting the creativity of users is now an industry-wide concern. Xbox 360 owners can look forward to Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts and Bolts, a comic book-style adventure where players create their own vehicles out of hundreds of parts, then show them off on Xbox Live. Similarly, Wii has the bizarre battle game Mushroom Men, which involves back-garden wars between tiny fungal soldiers. Here, you bodge together your own Heath Robinson-style weapons by scavenging and combining objects from the environment. Wii-wise, I love BlastWorks, a 2D shooter that features an easy-to-use editor allowing the construction of levels, enemy craft and even bullet attack patterns. Users then trade their wares on dedicated site, <a href=\"http://blastworksdepot.com\">blastworksdepot.com</a>. It arrives in the UK next month.</p> <p>Over the next five years the role of the game designer is going to change dramatically, from creative overlord to benevolent empowerer. The didactic linearity that characterised games in the last generation of hardware is a relic of an era in which underpowered processors needed to construct glittering but restrictive graphical corridors around gamers. In these days of open worlds and sandbox design, linearity and slavish adherence to the design whims of other people makes little sense. </p> <p>Going back to the YouTube point, the evolution of game design reflects the shift to web 2.0: there's a similar throughline of changing user experience, from consumption to communication to creation. We're all now constructing advanced content-sharing and community elements around our blogs and Facebook pages. It makes no sense, then, to turn on a console and find yourself prodded and pushed at every turn. Titles like LittleBigPlanet will, like YouTube, nudge users toward creativity without anyone even realising it.</p>",
  "<p>It is disappointing to learn from your survey that 83% of Conservative party candidates appear to have learned nothing from the time limit debate in parliament in May 2008 (Progressive on tax, protective of family: how the Cameron candidates see it, September 9). </p> <p>When MPs carefully considered the abortion issue in May, they overwhelmingly rejected any restriction in women's rights because there is no medical or social basis for such a move. They found that later abortion is only needed by a tiny minority of women in exceptional circumstances. The candidates and MPs attempting to restrict rights this autumn in the final stages of the human fertilisation and embryology bill will come up against strong opposition from all of the relevant medical professional organisations, the sexual health organisations, women's groups and the trade union movement. On Monday the TUC voted overwhelmingly to redouble its efforts in support of a woman's right to choose.<br><strong>Lorene Fabian</strong><br>Unite the Union, chair of the 2008 TUC women's conference</p> <p>There was a lot of discussion about tax by these Tory candidates, but why weren't they asked where they stood with regard to the very rich being made to pay their fair share of tax? Getting in the rightful amount from these people would revolutionise the public purse. Why on earth wasn't this very important question put to them? <br><strong>Clint Backhouse</strong><br>Carlisle, Cumbria </p> <p>I was alarmed by the Victorian logic being applied to tax breaks for married couples by the new Tories. Leaving aside the rather distasteful and archaic assumption that the state of marriage is somehow more secure than an unofficial committed relationship, it strikes me as beyond belief that this proposal could result in anything other than the potential for sustained misery and potential abuse. </p> <p>Tax breaks do not make for love or a happy home; their only possible effect would be to artificially hold together a broken relationship for financial reasons, resulting in a traumatic environment for any children involved. No one benefits in that situation.<br><strong>Cyrus Bozorgmehr</strong><br>London</p> <p>So green taxes are to be used as a tool to decrease pollution. Now this may work or not. If it works then the \"family fund\" set up will not be a reliable form of tax redistribution. If it does not work, then it becomes a good method of tax redistribution. So tax redistribution is only credible if the tax does not stop pollution. So this policy cannot be both green and economically \"family friendly\".<br><strong>Carl Bush</strong><br>Lamlash, Isle of Arran</p> <p>Larry Elliott suggests that the Tories will not pay for the policy errors which have led to the current mortgage crisis (Comment, September 9). Neither major party advocated intervention over many years, as bankers increasingly turned their backs on financial responsibility.</p> <p>All politicians should now be pressed on how they are going to reverse the effects of extreme deregulation and the overdependence of the economy on the financial sector.<br><strong>Felix Thompson</strong><br>Belper, Derbyshire</p> <p>Jackie Ashley (Comment, September 8) has distilled an important truth about British politics - we are governed by a new class. Where once we were ruled by aristocrats, or by workers' representatives, we are now governed by a political elite whose members have made politics their full-time career of choice. Most have never done a normal day's work in their lives. If David Milliband becomes Labour leader or if David Cameron becomes PM, this will represent the ultimate triumph of the new politics.<br><strong>Alan Sillitoe</strong><br>London</p> <p>One would imagine that a truly progressive Conservative party would attempt to improve state education to the point at which in, say 20 or 30 years' time, the majority of the Tory shadow cabinet would have been educated in the state sector.<br><strong>John Vosper</strong><br>Cheadle, Cheshire</p>",
  "<p>The seven years since 9/11 reveal an old truth: problems are usually not solved, they are just overtaken by other problems. Those of 8/8, for instance. On August 8 2008, two mighty nations announced their return to history. Russia, invading Georgia, did it with tanks. China, launching the Beijing Olympics, did it with acrobats. The message was the same: world, we're back.</p> <p>Don't get me wrong. A grave threat from jihadist terrorists, potentially armed with atomic, biological or chemical weapons, hangs over us still. They have a faith-based ideology with proven appeal to a minority of disaffected Muslims, especially those living in the west, and the means to wreak cut-price mayhem are alarmingly easy to find. Even as you read this, another hard-to-detect groupuscule, working in a back room close to you, may have taken the occasion of the 9/11 anniversary to try again. They won't always be foiled. Protecting us from another 9/11, while not destroying our freedom in order to save it, remains a major challenge to political leadership in every free country. </p> <p>What has proved false is the neoconservative claim that this single threat defines the whole pattern of world politics in our time; that, as Norman Podhoretz puts it, the struggle against Islamofascism is world war four. Returning to the United States after a year's absence, I'm struck by how relatively little even the American right is talking about the \"war on terror\".</p> <p>Beyond terrorism, two giant changes define our world. Both can, to a large extent, be traced back to the worldwide spread of marketised economic development (or globalisation). The first is the \"rise of the rest\", made manifest on 8/8. Non-western powers challenge the economic dominance of the west. They are beating the west at the game it invented, and quietly changing the rules along the way. Analysts at Goldman Sachs predict that by 2040, China, India, Russia, Brazil and Mexico will have a larger combined economic output than today's G7. The date matters less than the trend. Even today, the shifts in economic power are translating into political and military power faster than many anticipated. </p> <p>At the same time, worldwide economic development on the basis of the free movement of goods, capital, services and, to a lesser extent, people, is exacerbating transnational problems. CO2 emissions that accelerate climate change, mass migration, the risk of pandemics: all these cry out for international, cooperative responses. The need for liberal international order has never been greater. Yet, by contrast with the 1990s, when president George HW Bush hoped to replace the cold war with a \"new world order\", the prospects of achieving it no longer look so good. Power is diffused to too many competing states, many of them illiberal, as well as elusive networks like al-Qaida.</p> <p>So we of the FLIO (friends of liberal international order) must now confront the prospect of a new world disorder. Or rather old-new, for disorder rather than order is the more natural condition of international society. International order, which may also be called peace, is a fragile achievement. It hardly needs repeating that in its response to the 9/11 attacks, the Bush administration has, over these seven lean years, contributed to the erosion, rather than the building, of international order. The Russian invasion of Georgia was, among other things, payback for the US invasion of Iraq.</p> <p>While order is threatened, liberty is no longer on the forward march. The French refer to their 30 years of economic growth after the second world war as the trente glorieuses. Future historians may regard the three decades from Portugal's revolution of the carnations in 1974 to Ukraine's Orange revolution in 2004 as trente glorieuses for the spread of liberty, in Europe but also in Latin America, Africa and parts of Asia. </p> <p>Russia and China are not just great powers challenging the west. They also represent alternative versions of authoritarian capitalism, or capitalist authoritarianism. Here's the biggest potential ideological competitor to liberal democratic capitalism since the end of communism. Radical Islamism may appeal to millions of Muslims, but it cannot reach beyond the umma of the faithful except by conversion. More important, it cannot plausibly claim to be associated with economic, technological and cultural modernity. </p> <p>By contrast, the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics, like the skyscrapers of Shanghai, show us how authoritarian capitalism already stakes that claim. In the Bird's Nest stadium, the latest audiovisual hi-tech was placed at the service of a hyper-disciplined collectivist fantasy, made possible by financial resources no democracy would have dared devote to such a purpose. Zhang Yimou, the artistic director of the games ceremonies, said only North Korea could have matched such feats of mass synchronisation.</p> <p>For close to 500 years, modernity has come from the west. The historian Theodore von Laue called this The World Revolution of Westernisation. In 20th-century Europe, liberal democracy faced two powerful versions of modernity that were western but illiberal: fascism and communism. Part of these systems' appeal was precisely that they were modern. (\"I have seen the future and it works,\" said one enthusiast, returning from Moscow.) Liberal democracy finally saw them both off, though not without a world war, a cold war, and a lot of help from the US. </p> <p>In China, we glimpse the prospect of a modernity which is both non-western and illiberal. But is authoritarian capitalism a stable, durable model? That, it seems to me, is among the greatest questions of our time, which is still a post-9/11 time, but also a post-8/8 time, and, ecologically, a five-minutes-to-midnight time.</p> <p>As we of the FLIO think about how to respond to this multiple-front challenge, I have more sympathy than many Europeans do for the notion, canvassed by American policy intellectuals supporting both John McCain and Barack Obama, of a \"concert of democracies\". We should look first to those countries who share our values in the way they govern themselves - and there are more of them now, after these trente glorieuses for liberty. But only with several vital caveats.</p> <p>First, we should not kid ourselves that we can have only liberal democracies as partners. Our values may pull us that way, but our interests will necessarily push us to relationships and even partnerships with currently illiberal states as well. So any institutionalised League of Democracies, arrayed against an Association of Autocrats (Robert Kagan's vivid term), is a seriously bad idea - even assuming you could agree who merits inclusion in the league. Bipolar disorder would be no improvement on multipolar.</p> <p>It's also not the smartest idea to identify this vision of a concert of democracies too emphatically with the west, as in the former French prime minister Edouard Balladur's proposal for what he calls a Western Union. Historically, both modernity and liberalism have come from the west. But the future of freedom now depends on the possibility of new versions of modernity evolving - whether in India, China or the Muslim world, which are distinctly non-western yet also recognisably liberal, in the core sense of cherishing individual freedom. I wouldn't bet on this outcome, but working towards it is the best long-term chance we have. Pessimism of the intellect must be matched by optimism of the will.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.timothygartonash.com\">Timothygartonash.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Three women earned more than \u00a33m last year at companies inside the FTSE 350, a remarkable increase from the position five years ago when only one woman managed to make it above the \u00a31m mark.</p> <p>There was also a sharp increase in the number of women in the boardroom. The highest earner was Angela Ahrendts, who has maintained the momentum of Burberry, the once dowdy British fashion brand that has become a global luxury label. She earned a little under \u00a34.2m, including a bonus for joining the business. </p> <p>Ahrendts outstripped Dame Marjorie Scardino, the boss of Pearson, owner of the Financial Times and Penguin Books, who for the third year running was the best paid woman in the FTSE 100. However, her salary of \u00a34.2m, including \u00a31.8m from a share option scheme awarded in 2004, was only enough to place her at 38th in the FTSE 100 directors table.</p> <p>Lisa Morgan, who runs Game, one of the few high street retailers enjoying strong sales on the back of a boom in the video games market, was third highest paid. Morgan collected almost \u00a33.5m last year, her salary and bonus a little over \u00a31m with the rest from cashing in share options. She has been with Game for 10 years and had previously worked as a buyer at Dixons.</p> <p>Both Ahrendts and Scardino were born in the US and north American women tend to dominate the ranks of high earners. The top four best paid women in the FTSE 100 are all north American - the likely result of remuneration committees judging that to retain their talents, they need to match the level of salaries the executives could command back home. The second best paid woman in the FTSE 100 is Cynthia Carroll, who made \u00a32.7m as head of the mining group Anglo American. She was the first woman to head the company and the first chief executive to come from outside the business when she joined at the end of 2006. However, her earnings were less than the average salary of executive directors on the FTSE 100, which was \u00a32.8m last year.</p> <p>The Canadian-born boss of the London Stock Exchange, Dame Clara Furse, who has run the exchange since 2001 and proved her mettle in seeing off the acquisitive attentions of a string of suitors including Nasdaq, made a little over \u00a32m.</p> <p>The fourth north American is Terri Dial, otherwise known as the \"human cyclone\", who, until March this year, was running the retail arm of Lloyds TSB. The 58-year old Californian began her career as a bank teller in the US and before coming to Britain ran the retail division of Wells Fargo. She joined Lloyds in 2005, last year earning a shade under \u00a32m, and is widely credited with helping to rejuvenate the bank's high street presence. She left the bank to join Citigroup and has been replaced by Helen Weir, 44, a former McKinsey consultant who earned \u00a31.6m as Lloyds finance director last year.</p> <p>There were 23 female executive directors in the FTSE 100, up from 16, but still only a fraction of the 541 executive directors in the index. The highest placed newcomer on the list was Lucy Neville-Rolfe, who was the first female director appointed to the executive board of Tesco. She is executive director of corporate and legal affairs and has been at the supermarket for more than 10 years.</p> <p>Scardino was the first woman to run a FTSE 100 company and is now one of the longest serving chief executives in the index. She has been at Pearson for 11 years, confounding the sceptics who thought that she would quit after completing a radical restructuring of the business, selling off non-core divisions including Lazards the investment bank and the Tussauds Group. </p> <p>Instead she has pushed the business into educational publishing and developed the Financial Times as a global brand. Before joining Pearson she was chief executive of the Economist Group, which is 50% owned by Pearson.</p> <h2>Profile: Lisa Morgan</h2> <p>The highest paid woman employed by a UK-quoted company works not for one of Britain's blue-chip FTSE 100 companies but is chief executive of Game Group, a computer game chain. Lisa Morgan, 37, was rewarded with almost \u00a33.5m last year. Her basic salary of \u00a3435,000 was less than her annual bonus of \u00a3544,000 and she also had big gains from share-based incentive schemes.</p> <p>Morgan has spent her entire career in the world of electronic toys and games, joining the now defunct Tandy chain when she was 19.</p> <p>After a stint as a toy buyer she joined computer games retailer Future Zone and later moved to Dixons, now known as DSG.</p> <p>In 1997 she joined the US Electronics Boutique group, which acquired Game in 1999 and three years later, with Morgan on the board, the UK arm became an independent business.</p> <p>She was promoted to chief executive in October 2006 and her time at the top of the company has coincided with a boom in gaming prompted by new consoles such as Sony's PS3 and PSP, the Wii and games including this year's best-seller, Grand Theft Auto IV.</p> <p>Game has grown rapidly, acquiring businesses overseas. It operates more than 1,000 stores worldwide. This year the company reported like-for-like sales up 41% and profits up 156% to \u00a375m. </p> <p>The shares, which stood at 190p a year ago, touched 300p in the spring though yesterday they fell 23.5p to 220.5p.</p> <p>Morgan lives in Hampshire, close to Game's Basingstoke head office, and spends her spare time not on the sofa in front of a games console, but in the saddle - she is a keen horse rider and dressage specialist.<br><strong>Julia Finch </strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Friday September 12 2008. We were wrong to say in the profile of Lisa Morgan, the chief executive of the high street retailer Game, that she earned more than \u00a34.6m last year, particularly as we correctly reported her earnings as almost \u00a33.5m in the main article. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>A 15-year-old girl walks up to an Iraqi police checkpoint on her way to the crowded central market in Baquba, a town some 40 miles north of Baghdad. A constable senses something odd and demands she be searched. The girl promptly announces she is wearing a suicide belt, strapped like a lethal corset round her waist. </p> <p>In police footage that has gone around the world on YouTube, Rania Ibrahim is handcuffed to metal railings while male officers get her to remove her outer garments, then carefully defuse the device. Never mind the fact that the area is not cordoned off, and other policemen wander close to the girl to gawp. It took not only exceptional bravery but a degree of professionalism that many in Baghdad had not credited the Iraqi police with. The officer who disabled the device was given a 5m dinar (about \u00a32,400) bonus.</p> <p>Horror, relief, amazement - but beyond the emotions aroused, a crucial question remains unresolved a fortnight after Ibrahim and many others escaped death. Was she a victim or a villain? And whatever her motives, why has the number of female suicide bombers soared during the past year in a nation that, with Egypt, Syria and Lebanon, has long been seen as one of the most developed and secular societies in the Middle East? </p> <p>Lt Col DA Sims, deputy commanding officer of the Baquba-based US 2nd Stryker Cavalry Regiment, whose staff also interrogated the girl, has an open mind about Ibrahim's intentions - whether someone strapped the bomb to her against her will and she deliberately behaved oddly at the checkpoint so as to be discovered, or whether she did intend to blow herself up but was pre-empted by police and then tried to lie herself out of trouble.</p> <p>\"The Iraqi police identified her as suspicious and she immediately said, 'Hey, I want to turn myself in.' She realised she was making a mistake,\" Sims says. He is not sure whether the mistake was to start out on a road leading to a violent early death, or to get caught before fulfilling her mission.</p> <p>Saja Qaduri, a member of the Diyala provincial council (Baquba is Diyala's capital) and the only woman on its security committee, sat in on some of the police interrogation of Ibrahim. She believes the girl was a committed would-be suicide bomber.</p> <p>Qaduri says that the girl spoke in a slow, drowsy way during the first moments after the suicide belt had been defused and taken off her, and appeared to have been drugged. But this did not mean she was being made to do something against her will. It could have been done to dull her emotions and reduce the chance of her backing off when the moment came to trigger the belt. \"I was at the police station when they first brought her in for questioning. As the pills wore off, she spoke in a very confident way. She strongly believed her death would have taken her to heaven. She was detected because some wires were visible. A policeman spotted it,\" Qaduri adds. </p> <p>In spite of her faith that suicide and murder would take her to paradise, Ibrahim showed flashes of teenage confusion. \"At the end of every sentence, she kept saying 'I want my mum'\", Qaduri says. </p> <p>If Ibrahim was a genuinely willing suicide bomber, wider and more complex issues of motivation need to be probed. It doesn't remove the victim-or-villain issue. </p> <p>Diyala, named after one of the rivers that flow through it (the other is the Tigris), is one of the most conservative rural provinces in Iraq. In its most fertile south-eastern region date palms, orange groves and pomegranate trees stretch for mile after mile along a network of irrigation canals. Few roads are paved, donkey carts are common, and villages are isolated. Tribal structures are strong, male dominance is all-pervasive, and women have suffered repression for centuries. By the age of 15 many girls are married - as Ibrahim was. Few can read. </p> <p>In this restrictive context, \"these women are also victims of the situation\", says Qaduri. \"Even this 15-year-old, you feel sorry for her, very young and uneducated. She has no awareness. She comes from a very poor family. Her husband is on the run as a suspected al-Qaida terrorist. He told her he would meet her in paradise.\" (He was arrested by Iraqi police in the town of Hit about a week later.) </p> <p>The view of Iraq as a member of the club of the Middle East's more developed and secular countries is not wrong - as far as it goes. Essentially this applies to the Baghdad area, with its large, well-travelled middle class, many of whose women and men are fluent English speakers from the days when English was the language of instruction in almost every medical and engineering college. (Under Saddam Hussein, and even more so as a result of the chaos unleashed by the US occupation, hundreds of thousands have fled abroad, totalling between a third and a half of the country's best-educated professionals.)</p> <p>But among the substantial population in the countryside, as well as a swelling generation of rural migrants who are pulled or pushed into urban slums by the prospect of better pay, country traditions still hold sway in the lives of women: tribal values and patriarchal culture remain extremely strong.</p> <p>In villages and small towns, women are considered little more than chattels who may not go out of the home unless accompanied by their husbands or a male relative. Three wars in a quarter of a century have left Iraq with more than a million young or middle-aged widows. They are not permitted to live alone, nor do most want to. The death of a husband is not just a cause of grief, bereavement and loneliness. It collapses a woman's sense of worth, within her extended family as well as in the wider community. Her protection is gone, plus her source of financial support. Unless the woman remarries - a rarity, given the shortage of men - a nephew or a male cousin will be required to move into the house to provide protection, unless one or more of her sons is already in his late teens.</p> <p>The result can be corrosive levels of depression that haunt women who have seen fathers, brothers, and husbands killed - so, while Ibrahim is the first female suicide bomber to be thwarted in Diyala, many others have gone out into the street wearing a deadly hidden belt. Throughout Iraq some 43 women have carried out suicide bombings since 2003, mostly in the past two years. In 2007 eight women blew themselves up. This year the number is already 30, of whom 15 were in Diyala.</p> <p>On a single day in July, four women exploded their belts in Baghdad and the northern city of Kirkuk, killing at least 44 people. The Iraqi police and US military sources blame al-Qaida for almost all the attacks. Though the movement was brought to Iraq by foreign Arabs, all but one of the woman bombers were Iraqi. Most were between the ages of 15 and 35.</p> <p>Iraq is not the first Arab country to produce a woman suicide bomber. The first recorded case took place in Lebanon in 1985, where a young pro-Syrian militant targeted an Israeli army unit. In the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories, bombings by women have also become more frequent, with 10 attacks since 2002.</p> <p>Women suicide bombers in Iraq are still far outnumbered by their male counterparts but simple logistics offer one explanation for the upward trend: it is a fair bet that men are pushing women into doing this \"man's job\" because they usually have a better chance of passing checkpoints wearing their long black cloaks, and male police feel inhibited about touching them. The Diyala police force has recruited 200 women to work at checkpoints and 20 women will graduate from the local police college next month.</p> <p>Part of the answer to why the chaos launched by the US occupation has impinged so sharply on Diyala, turning a rural backwater into a destructive and self-destructive cauldron of violence, lies in the province's combination of rural conservatism and unusual ethnic makeup. This combination has made it (including its women) vulnerable to political exploitation, not least by al-Qaida, a group that wasn't active in Iraq until the US invasion in 2003.</p> <p>Most of Iraq's 18 provinces have one dominant group, whether it be Kurds in the three northern provinces, Arab Shias in Basra and the south-east, or Arab Sunnis in Anbar and Saddam's province of Salaheddin. Only Baghdad, the metropolitan area encompassing Nineveh and the city of Mosul, and Diyala have a more even mix.</p> <p>The balance in Diyala is particularly precarious, with roughly one-third Kurd, one-third Arab Shia and one-third Arab Sunni. The Kurds mainly live in the distant north-east so the main struggle for influence, once al-Qaida arrived to try to exploit sectarianism, has been between Arab Sunnis and Shias. It centres on Baquba and the crucial south-western corner of the province that connects Baghdad to the north.</p> <p>Some Sunnis in the area were close to Saddam and his Ba'ath party; graffiti supporting him could often be seen on walls in the rural parts of Diyala. Other non-Baathist nationalist groups sprang up to confront the Americans in the early months of the occupation. Before the Iraqi army was reconstituted, the US responded with air strikes, ground offensives and mass round-ups of villagers, which, as in Afghanistan, tended to create a pool of people seeking revenge or redress.</p> <p>Al-Qaida came into this mix in 2004, stirring up anti-Shia suspicions by claiming the Shia were all agents of Iran and no longer true Muslims anyway, an ideology known as takfir. Since the government in Baghdad was Shia-led, it was easy to convince the ignorant that Iraq was under occupation by Iran as well as the US.</p> <p>US military officials say investigations of the family circumstances of the women suicide bombers who succeeded put them into three rough categories: women whose husbands, fathers or brothers, were killed by US or Iraqi forces; women who accepted the takfiri line that all Shia are enemies and must be killed; and women who were married at a young age to an al-Qaida man and sometimes were passed on from him to others in a pattern that is untypical of normal Iraqi life, and leaves women feeling worthless, violated and desperate.</p> <p>\"We're finding a disillusioned woman,\" says Sims. \"Al-Qaida has led her to believe [in its ideology], or she may have resentment against the Iraqi government or coalition forces.\" He hopes Ibrahim's case will influence other women. \"I would hope there are women who were either tempted, or coerced, or persuaded but have now realised that the value of women's rights and the role of women in society will be greater by not blowing themselves up\".</p> <p>Qaduri is a Shia. Her husband was a member of prime minister Nouri al-Maliki's party. He was kidnapped two years ago at a bogus police checkpoint on his way from university to collect her from her job at the council offices. No ransom demand was ever made and she has not heard from him since. She assumes the crime was committed by al-Qaida and speaks energetically about the group's negative influence, pointing out that none of the women bombers were Shia. </p> <p>She acknowledges that Sunnis have also suffered from al-Qaida. Nationalist insurgent groups (she names one called Hamas in Iraq, and another called the 1920 Revolutionary Brigades) were active in Diyala before al-Qaida but they then started to work with it, she says. </p> <p>\"When al-Qaida began to control Baquba and said, 'We've freed the area', the other groups said, 'You came to our country. We should be in charge.' They started to create the 'Awakening Movement' of Sunnis against al-Qaida but al-Qaida assassinated many of them,\" she adds. Al-Qaida went on to proclaim Qatun, a town in Diyala west of Baquba, the first capital of the Islamic State of Iraq, a move that alienated many other Sunnis.</p> <p>By then al-Qaida had infiltrated Diyala's isolated rural areas, getting tribes and subtribes to join them. Women were soon brought into the net. \"Typically, a young woman's father or brother may be working with al-Qaida and they force the girl to marry an al-Qaida leader. She may not have met the man before. In some cases there is a formal marriage. We have found certificates from their Islamic State of Iraq with husbands' names that are Sudanese, Saudi, Afghan, Pakistani, Yemeni, and Egyptian,\" Qaduri says. </p> <p>Ibrahim's husband is Iraqi and \"has some clear al-Qaida attachments\", says Sims. </p> <p>In other cases girls have been handed to an al-Qaida man, and then to another when the first one left the area or was killed. Arrested al-Qaida leaders have given information that led to raids on houses in Diyala where women were found who, Iraqi police believe, were being prepared for suicide bombing. In one house they came across a pregnant 15-year-old who said she had been married a dozen times and had no idea who the father of her child was. \"These girls are very depressed and ready to end their lives,\" Qaduri says. </p> <p>The same is true of young women whose husbands, fathers, or brothers have been killed by US or Iraqi forces, a category that she and other officials say is larger than that of the al-Qaida converts or those forced into marriage with al-Qaida members. </p> <p>Can the phenomenon be stopped? Last year the Americans started a re-education programme in the prisons where they hold Iraqis. Helped by the Iraqi Islamic party, which represents moderate Sunni Islamists and fiercely opposes al-Qaida, the programme aims to expose takfir as heresy unsupported by the Qu'ran. Adult Sunni prisoners attend the classes.</p> <p>Dealing with young women who are vulnerable to al-Qaida recruiting in remote parts of Diyala is a harder task. Qaduri says the priority has to be to restore peace and security to Iraq. Ideally, she would have women's shelters and rehabilitation programmes for young women. But this is not realistic now. In the meantime, the 20 or so young women whom police identified as potential bombers remain at home in the enclosed and sad environment that has led others like them to blow themselves up. Qaduri sums up the dilemma: \"We don't have proof, so they are still living there\".</p>",
  "<p>Britain will join several large European economies in slipping into recession in the second half of this year because of the credit crunch, high commodity prices and collapsing housing markets, the European commission said yesterday.</p> <p>Publishing its half-year economic assessment of the eurozone and other European economies, the commission said warnings in its spring forecasts about an economic slowdown and rising inflation had been confirmed.</p> <p>\"The main downside risks identified in the spring forecast have materialised, with the financial turmoil deepening, commodity prices soaring and the shocks to several housing markets spreading more widely,\" the commission said.</p> <p>Although the 15-nation eurozone as a whole would avoid a technical recession, it would grow by 1.3% this year instead of the 1.7% the EC forecast six months ago. </p> <p>Germany and Spain will also suffer a technical recession while France and Italy will stagnate but probably not contract, as they did in the second quarter.</p> <p>The commission raised its inflation estimate for the eurozone this year from 3.1% to 3.6% - almost twice the European Central Bank's target of just under 2%.</p> <p>It said the growth outlook remained more on the downside, and if the risks materialised growth could be 1.1% this year rather than 1.3%.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Britain's trade deficit in oil climbed to its highest figure on record in July, though there was a modest narrowing in the overall trade gap with the rest of the world.</p> <p>The Office for National Statistics said yesterday that Britain's goods trade deficit shrank to \u00a37.6bn in July from an upwardly revised \u00a37.9bn in June.</p> <p>The goods trade gap with non-EU countries was broadly flat at \u00a34.7bn. The balance on trade in oil was in deficit by \u00a31.3bn in July, compared with \u00a3700m in June. The ONS said this could be a result of changing maintenance patterns at North Sea oil rigs and because the high price of oil meant fairly small changes in volumes could have a big effect.</p> <p>Paul Dales at Capital Economics said: \"July's UK trade figures provide very little evidence that exporters are feeling the benefits of the lower pound. Admittedly, it takes time for the effects of the lower pound to be felt, but a significant surge in exports seems unlikely when the overseas environment - particularly in the UK's largest export market, the eurozone - remains so weak. Overall, today's data increase the chances that net trade will make another positive contribution to GDP growth in Q3. But we doubt that it will be enough to prevent overall GDP from contracting.\"</p>",
  "<p>Lehman Brothers yesterday attempted to rebuild shattered confidence in the bank, rushing out its third quarter results and outlining a series of measures to raise cash and sharply reduce its exposure to the ailing property market.</p> <p>The bank said it had lost $3.9bn in the third quarter, mainly from a further $5.6bn of write-downs related to commercial and residential property investments.</p> <p>In a hastily convened conference call, Lehman chief executive Richard Fuld said the bank would continue to examine other strategic options, which analysts said was akin to putting a for-sale sign above the business.</p> <p>Fuld described the current crisis as \"an extraordinary time for our industry and one of the toughest in the firm's history\" but said the bank would pull through. \"We have been through adversity before and always come out a lot stronger.\"</p> <p>But the bank failed to calm all investors. After a volatile day, shares in the bank closed another 7% down at $7.25. Credit default swaps, the instruments that provide a type of insurance on its debt, also widened, underlining the sense that doubts over Lehman's future remain.</p> <p>Moody's, the credit rating agency, said Lehman was facing a \"crisis of confidence\" and warned that it might yet downgrade its debt.</p> <p>Lehman was due to publish third quarter figures next week but brought the announcement forward as fears it could be the next victim of the credit crunch sent its shares 45% lower on Tuesday.</p> <p>The bank intends to spin most of its commercial property assets, around $30bn, into a separate company and is selling off $4bn of its UK residential mortgage portfolio to the private equity firm Blackrock. Lehman has been a major player in property in recent years.</p> <p>The bank is also slashing its year end dividend from 68 cents to 5 cents, a move that will save $450m. Lehman said it reduced its global headcount by around 1,500 workers over the past quarter.</p> <p>The investment bank is in advanced talks to sell off a 55% stake in its lucrative investment management division, which includes the asset manager Neuberger Berman. Analysts reckon the division is worth about $10bn.</p> <p>The moves, Fuld said, had \"quickly de-risked and re-sized\" the firm. \"We will have what we believe to be a strong and clean balance sheet that will allow us to focus on our core client businesses.\"</p> <p>The market has been on high alert since the near collapse of Bear Stearns in March and fears for the future of Lehman Brothers had wiped almost 300 points off the Dow Jones industrial average on Tuesday.</p> <p>Wall Street made significant gains early yesterday but by the end of the session any enthusiasm had evaporated and the Dow closed just 38 points higher at 11,269.</p> <p>The latest focus for anxiety was Washington Mutual - its shares were down more than 25% after a downgrade from the credit rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's.</p> <p>The sharp fall in Lehman shares on Tuesday was sparked by a report that talks had broken down with a potential investor, the Korea Development Bank, and that its options for raising much-needed capital were running out.</p> <p>KDB, which is owned by the South Korean government, yesterday confirmed that it had pulled out of talks due to \"disagreements over transaction terms and in consideration of the state of financial markets at home and abroad\".</p> <p>Lehman has had failed talks with at least two other firms.</p> <p>The bank said it had already been reducing its exposure to property but felt the need to accelerate efforts. Including the Blackrock deal, it has reduced its exposure to residential property by 47%.</p> <p>Lehman intends to spin off its commercial real estate division, to be called Real Estate Investments Global, in the first quarter of next year.</p> <p>The gross write-downs included $5.3bn on residential mortgages and $1.7bn on commercial real estate positions, offset partly by hedging.</p> <p>The loss was the Lehman's largest since going public in 1994 and followed a deficit of $2.8bn in the second quarter.</p> <p>Asked if he would consider a buyer for the entire bank, Fuld responded: \"I have always said that if anybody came up with an attractive proposition that made it compelling for shareholder value, it would be brought to the board and evaluated, and that has not changed.\"</p> <h2>Backstory</h2> <p>Lehman Brothers' loss of $3.9bn (\u00a32.21bn) in the third quarter contrasts with a profit of $887m in the same period a year ago, before the bank's heavy exposure to commercial property and residential mortgages battered the firm. As well as the property write-downs, Lehman has also lost $760m on its own principal investments. The investment banking division reported revenues of $600m, down from $1.1bn in the same quarter a year ago. Advisory fees from mergers and acquisitions have halved to $200m. But the bank is keen to stress that its financial position remains solid.</p>",
  "<p>Charles Allen has been appointed to the board of Virgin Media, the cable company that tried to buy ITV soon after he stepped down as its chief executive.</p> <p>Virgin, at that time still trading as NTL-Telewest, made a cash and shares offer for ITV in November 2006, valuing the company at \u00a34.7bn. The bid was rejected days after Virgin's satellite rival, BSkyB, spent \u00a3940m buying a 17.9% stake in ITV.</p> <p>Allen, who masterminded the merger between Granada and Carlton to create a single ITV, had relinquished his role as ITV's chief executive the month before. Allen's appointment to the Virgin board comes in the same week that he became an adviser to another of ITV's former suitors, Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, as well as a director of Endemol, the TV production company often touted as a potential bidder for ITV.</p> <p>Allen has already re-established himself in the media sector as the non-executive chairman of Global Radio, the privately held group that has become Britain's leading commercial radio company after buying Chrysalis and GCap Media.</p> <p>Virgin also appointed cable industry veteran John Rigsby to its board.</p>",
  "<p>Ever since Andy Burnham was appointed to what he described as his \"dream job\" of culture, media and sport secretary in January, the men who run English football have been awaiting with some trepidation his stance towards the game's freewheeling relationship with money. </p> <p>In this respect, Burnham is a known quantity, an opponent of a clinically commercial view of football, champion of supporter ownership of clubs and the game's grassroots. Given an unpromising brief as administrator of the toothless Football Task Force a decade ago, he fought hard against the prevailing view that football was simply a free-market business which should be left alone to run itself. </p> <p>Burnham was a pioneer and chairman of Supporters Direct, the initiative which helps supporters gain a stake and say in the running of their clubs, and was instrumental in persuading the Premier League to contribute 5% of its booming television money to grassroots facilities via the Football Foundation. </p> <p>Given that form, Burnham has bided his time before presenting his vision, not wanting to be seen as too eager to get his teeth into big-business football, now he has a position of genuine influence. </p> <p>The choice of venue for his first substantial statements on football is significant: a speech to the Co-operative Party, which is dedicated to mutual forms of ownership. Speaking to the Guardian yesterday before his speech, Burnham said he is \"not flinching\" from his view that supporter ownership is the ideal model for football clubs, most true to their character as sporting homes of belonging, rather than \"global brands\" to be bought for profit. </p> <p>His comments are not intended as an attack on \"foreign\" ownership, but he does point to dangers for the fabric of football in English clubs' openness to takeovers from anywhere. \"We should not delude ourselves that the reason England is attracting so much interest is solely because of the quality of football,\" he said. \"It is also because other countries, such as Germany and Spain, have football clubs which are mutually owned by their supporters, democratic and not for sale. I believe English football is at a crossroads and if it follows the same path in the next 10 years, there is a risk that it will lose touch with its core support.\"</p> <p>There is an inescapable sense of deja vu in these remarks. The Football Task Force, which brought fans' groups together with the game's authorities in an ultimately failed attempt to reach agreement, covered similar ground. Burnham then supported the call for a \"fit and proper person test\" which the FA and Premier and Football Leagues rejected, and he commissioned research which showed that young and less well-off fans had been excluded by price rises - which look distinctly modest compared to prices now. </p> <p>However, besides Supporters Direct and the Football Foundation, the Task Force led to no action on club ownership, ticket prices or the distribution of money in the game. The government was clear it was not going to intervene by legislating or imposing a regulator, and it will not do so now. It was always Burnham's view that the FA is the governing body responsible, but it was not taking that job on with sufficient vigour or confidence. </p> <p>\"One body is responsible for the full spectrum of the English game and that is the FA,\" he explained yesterday. \"Regulation has to be led by the FA; it is not for the government to run football. It is time for the FA to step up to the challenge, lead an in-depth look at the regulation of football's finances, and be more robust, for the overall health of the game.\"</p> <p>While resisting talking about specific clubs, it is clear that as an Everton fan, Burnham is concerned that the takeover of Manchester City by Sheikh Mansour of Abu Dhabi will further concentrate success in the hands of the richest clubs. </p> <p>\"If we have a big five now, not just a big four, what will other clubs have to play for at the top?\" he asked. \"Lower down, there is a huge gap between the Premier League and Championship, and for Championship clubs, promotion can be an unhappy experience, which is not good.\"</p> <p>To address this competitive imbalance, and to encourage more players to develop and eventually strengthen the England team, Burnham favours introducing quotas of home-grown players, which the Premier League vehemently opposes. Burnham also wants the Premier League to look more closely at a fairer distribution of TV money, to ensure a more level financial field on which clubs will compete.</p> <p>\"The Premier League has taken steps towards more even sharing [the income from overseas TV rights, which has been increasing, is shared equally among the 20 clubs]. But I keep referring to the NFL, which has equal sharing, and in which owners cannot simply pour money in from outside to buy all the best players. In the US, the most free-market country in the world, they understand that equal distribution of money creates genuine competition, which is good for the league. The danger in England is that individual clubs rush for the money today, without considering the long-term future, and so diminish the game.</p> <p>\"We need to ask urgently what we want for the future of our game, before something precious is lost. I am asking the FA to rise to that challenge.\"</p> <p>Burnham argues that the \"fit and proper person test\", currently restricted to barring directors or 30% shareholders if they are convicted criminals or bankrupts, should be widened. Prospective owners should have to show their plans for clubs, to demonstrate they will act in clubs' best interests, and not introduce large debts. </p> <p>On ticket prices, he is not prepared to prescribe what clubs can charge, but does want to see matches made more affordable. \"High ticket prices have largely excluded young people. A generation has grown up without the great, formative experience I had of being a football fan.\"</p> <p>Burnham supported the same ideas 10 years ago, but the FA then stood with the Premier and Football Leagues to resist any regulation. Now, however, the governing body looks less of a laughing stock under the chairmanship of Lord Triesman, a Labour peer who has developed a close working relationship with Burnham. The pair have discussed Burnham's speech already, with Triesman apparently agreeing to address these issues robustly.</p> <p>An FA spokesman said yesterday: \"Lord Triesman met with Andy Burnham to discuss some of the biggest issues facing the game, including fit and proper ownership of clubs and the development of home-grown talent. Like Andy he firmly believes that clubs must preserve their links with their communities, and shares concerns if clubs are being bought for their short-term investment value rather than their long-term success. These issues, and the need to reconsider football's regulatory framework in this area, are very high on the chairman's list of priorities.\" </p> <p>That, from an FA chairman, represents a sea change already. Whether anything substantial will result this time round, however, remains to be seen.</p> <h2>The supporters' champion</h2> <p>A lifelong Everton fan with his father and two brothers, Andy Burnham, right, has a political track record in football as a reformer, in the face of the game's commercial revolution.</p> <p>In 1997 Burnham was appointed as administrator to the Football Task Force, which brought fans' groups, academics and public figures together with the Football Association and the Premier and Football Leagues, to look into issues including club ownership, high ticket prices and clubs' relationship with their fans and local communities.</p> <p>Burnham became convinced of the merits of mutual, supporter ownership of clubs, which was then an obscure idea promoted by Brian Lomax, who had set up a supporters trust at Northampton Town and been elected as a director of the club for seven years.</p> <p>Even though the top clubs have since been taken over by a series of rich individuals from around the world, Burnham maintains his belief that supporter ownership is the ideal model.</p> <p>The Task Force reached agreement on the landmark establishment of the Football Foundation - to which the Premier League contributed 5% of its domestic television deal - and Supporters Direct.</p> <p>However, there was no agreement, and eventually a bitter split, on proposals for financial regulation. </p> <p>The authorities issued their own report rejecting all specific reforms and describing the game largely in business terms, while a majority of the Task Force signed up to another, which recommended measures that were similar to those Burnham is calling for now.</p> <p>Burnham will want to see more concrete progress, as the minister for culture, media and sport, 11 years on.</p>",
  "<p>It's become a hardy perennial of British public life that almost whatever trade unions do, they are ritually abused across much of the media. Where once they were absurdly said to be running the country, they are now dismissed as irrelevant loudmouths. No matter that unions remain by far the country's largest democratic social organisations and a good deal closer to mainstream public opinion - on everything from corporate profiteering to super-rich taxation - than the political leaders and newspapers that denounce them. They are still \"dinosaurs\" living in \"cloud-cuckoo land\", as far as papers such as the Sun and the Mail are concerned - whose owners were at the forefront of union-busting in the 1980s and still refuse to recognise unions to this day. </p> <p>That has been the background noise throughout this week's Trades Union Congress in Brighton. The more unions press the government to protect its own core voters - or offer a practical alternative economic programme to offset the impact of recession, as the TUC did this week - the more strident the attacks on them become. When public sector unions announced plans at the weekend to coordinate industrial action against cuts in real wages in the coming months, the media was awash with hoary predictions of a return to the 1970s and another \"winter of discontent\".</p> <p>That is wildly out of proportion. The mass walkouts on the eve of Margaret Thatcher's election were on a far bigger scale than anything on the cards now. But there are echoes of those days that should be a warning to Gordon Brown as he fights for political survival. Not only is an unelected prime minister struggling, as in 1978-9, to get to grips with an economic crisis and a resurgent Tory party. But the attempt to impose a 2% pay cap for three years in a row, with headline inflation now at 5%, closely mirrors the folly that triggered the industrial breakdown in the dog days of the Callaghan administration.</p> <p>Take the combination of effective pay cuts being imposed on six million public sector workers with escalating food and fuel costs, and the result is a dangerous double squeeze on the living standards of traditional Labour supporters. Brown's hapless fall guy, chancellor Alistair Darling, told TUC delegates on Tuesday that while current inflation was mainly caused by the global rise in oil and food prices, their members would have to tighten their belts to prevent inflation \"becoming entrenched\". </p> <p>It was just as well no one had the chance to challenge him on why that might be the case, as there's no economic reason why a loosening of public sector pay restraint should boost inflation, whatever issues it might raise for the public finances. Real-terms pay cuts, now being imposed across both public and private sectors, are, however, a drag on demand - at a time when the main threat to the British economy is recession, not inflation. </p> <p>They are also a self-inflicted political wound by the government, which is haemorrhaging support among millions of these mainly low-paid, women workers. If the result is, as expected, a rolling programme of strikes and disruption across public services, Brown and Darling will only have themselves to blame for yet another blow to their credibility.</p> <p>There were at least signs this week that ministers dimly recognise the direction they need to take, but in each case timidity immediately got the better of them. Brown acknowledged that social mobility had ground to a halt and said it was \"time to adapt and rethink New Labour policy\" - but then his spin doctors quickly insisted that didn't mean moving on from New Labour. Harriet Harman yesterday told the TUC that social background was the decisive, overarching form of inequality - but dropped the word \"class\" used in earlier media briefings like a hot potato. Darling blamed corporate executive bonuses as \"one of the major reasons for the global credit crunch\" - but later made clear that the only action being taken was a review by the Financial Services Authority, the body that oversaw the collapse of Northern Rock. That really should put the fear of God into the boardrooms.</p> <p>If today's energy measures are as trailed, they will deliver the same message of too little, too late. Cash for lagging lofts and insulating windows is welcome, but will do nothing for 5 million people in fuel poverty unable to heat their homes this winter. By failing to face down the energy companies over fuel bills, the sense that the prime minister had once again buckled before rampant corporate power caused despair in Brighton. Unless Brown is saving up something much bolder for Labour's conference in 10 days' time, his premiership is surely doomed.</p> <p>He does at least now have a breathing space. It was clear at the TUC that the imminent threat of a leadership challenge has evaporated, courtesy of David Miliband's premature move six weeks ago. To many Labour MPs and trade unionists, even Brown's dismal performance suddenly seemed more tolerable once it became clear that the Blairite foreign secretary was the only alternative on offer. Miliband's belligerent performance over the Georgian crisis - echoing the hawkish rhetoric from Washington - added to the sense he cannot represent the kind of break with the past 11 years that the government needs if it is to stage any kind of political comeback. </p> <p>In current economic conditions, only decisive action can make the difference. We are now in the bizarre situation where a neoconservative Republican US administration is taking far more radical measures than a British Labour government to combat the crisis: cutting interest rates, putting cash in people's pockets, intervening heavily in the financial markets, and now nationalising the country's two largest mortgage lenders, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.</p> <p>The scale of the market failure represented by the credit crunch and the breakdown of the neoliberal model should represent a huge opportunity for political parties of the left and the centre-left. The kind of policies advocated by the TUC this week - from tougher financial and utility regulation and lower VAT on energy bills, to minimum tax rates for the wealthy - could easily be picked up by the government. But although ministers privately acknowledge we have moved into \"different times\", they seem unable to draw the obvious conclusions. If Brown carries on stumbling towards the precipice, the pressure for another leader prepared to do just that is bound to re-emerge.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:s.milne@theguardian.com\">s.milne@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p><strong>The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Monday September 15 2008</strong></p> <p>In the article below we said that Northern Ireland politicians were absent from the memorial service, held in St Paul's Cathedral last week, to commemorate members of UK forces who served in Northern Ireland. We were informed by the executive information service of the Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister that there was no official representation, but in fact Peter Robinson, the first minister, was represented by Lord Morrow MLA, the DUP chief whip in the assembly.</p> <p> </p> <p>As a memorial it may have somewhat lacked the poignancy of a Remembrance Sunday or the sense of devastating loss from the trenches of the first world war, but yesterday, with due ceremony, the longest British military deployment in history - the 38-year campaign in Northern Ireland - was formally laid to rest at a service in St Paul's Cathedral, London.</p> <p>Two thousand veterans and their families - a small fraction of the 300,000 personnel who served as part of Operation Banner in the province between 1969 and last year - attended the service to remember old colleagues and tense times on the streets of Belfast and Derry and in the rolling fields of South Armagh. </p> <p>It was a conflict still vivid to them but somehow already distant in time, far away and no longer raw, though it lasted nearly four times the period of the first and second world wars combined. </p> <p>Lance Bombardier Stephen Restorick, the last of the 763 British military casualties of paramilitary terrorism in the province, was killed 11 years ago. By comparison, the much shorter but continuing conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan have already cost 176 and 117 British lives respectively.</p> <p>In the congregation were politicians whose reputations were marked by the Troubles. Lady Thatcher was there, and Tony Blair, both sitting a few rows back. Gordon Brown marched past them to the front row, glancing at neither. In front of him, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall represented the Queen. In the front row sat civic dignitaries and the chief of the defence staff, Air Chief Marshal Sir Jock Stirrup. His predecessor, Lord Inge, in command from 1994-1997, led the recital of an act of commitment during the service.</p> <p>They heard Richard Chartres, the Bishop of London, recall in his sermon that Harold Wilson, the prime minister who first authorised the deployment of troops back in 1969, had warned his cabinet that if the army was sent in, it would take many years to get it out.</p> <p>The bishop quoted WB Yeats's line from his poem The Second Coming, \"things fall apart, the centre cannot hold\", to argue that the military intervention had prevented anarchy: \"Mistakes were made but the British armed forces proved they had the discipline and the resilience to stand firm until there could be a political settlement ... Operation Banner has been a test of faith and resolve. If we come to believe that there is no more to life than looking after 'number one' and being as comfortable as possible until the end of our mortal span then the centre will not hold and the world as we know it will dissolve.\"</p> <p>Northern Irish politicians were conspicuous by their absence. It was said that the deputy first minister, Martin McGuinness, for so long associated with the IRA's campaign, had been invited but had declined. As it was, although the organist played Carrickfergus and Danny Boy, the only Ulster accent heard was that of Nicola-Louise Scanlon, 13, the daughter of a veteran, who lives in Northern Ireland and was invited to read a prayer. </p> <p>That left it to be a very British commemoration, a service for stoical stiff upper lips: the Old Hundredth psalm, and O God Our Help in Ages Past, and the reading of the Sermon on the Mount: blessed are the peacemakers. </p> <p>Mary Moreland, whose husband, John, was a part-time soldier with the Ulster Defence Regiment and was killed by terrorists while carrying out his civilian job as a coal merchant in 1988, lit a candle in memory of the military dead.</p> <p>Afterwards, about 700 of the veterans, paunchier, grey-haired and balding in their civvies but with their service medals gleaming, lined up outside under the watchful eye and barked commands of a Guards regimental sergeant major to march behind a military band through the City of London to a reception at Guildhall.</p>",
  "<p>Countries across the world will have to dramatically increase investment in dams, pipes and other water infrastructure to avoid widespread flooding, drought and disease even before climate change accelerates these problems, experts have warned.</p> <p>Investment needs to be at least doubled from the current level of $80bn (\u00a345.5bn) a year, an international congress was told this week, and one leading authority said spending needed to rise to 1.5% of gross domestic product just \"to be able to cope with the current climate\" - one thousand times the current level.</p> <p>The warnings follow a summer of dramatic events, from hurricane flooding in the Caribbean and the east coast of America to desperate measures in drought-stricken Mediterranean countries, including importing water by ship.</p> <p>Rich nations suffer huge under-investment, but the threat of poor infrastructure to populations in developing countries is even greater, said Dr Olcay Unver, director of the United Nations' Global Water Assessment Unit. </p> <p>So serious is the problem that next year the UN's World Water Assessment Report will make one of its main messages the need for investment to \"accelerate substantially\", said Unver.</p> <p>\"You can't justify the deaths of so many children because of lack of infrastructure or lost productive time of people [who are] intellectually or physically incapacitated because of simple lack of access to safe water or sanitation,\" he added.</p> <p>Dr Glen Daigger, senior vice-president of the International Water Association, said there was growing evidence that spending on clean water and sanitation was the single greatest contribution to reducing disease and death. The UN has identified dams for hydropower and irrigation as leading drivers of sustainable economic growth in developing countries. \"Water and sanitation is clearly a better investment than medical intervention, but it's not sexy,\" added Daigger.</p> <p>Last year the World Bank called for investment in water infrastructure to more than double from $80bn to $180bn over the next 20-25 years to cope with population growth and climate change, which are expected to leave about 4 billion people living in \"water stress\" areas - deemed to have insufficient water to meet daily needs. Conditions would be particularly severe in Africa, the Middle East and South Asia, said the bank. Water pollution and the threat to coastal areas of erosion, sea level rise and storm surges are also growing concerns.</p> <p>However, experts meeting at the IWA conference of 2,700 water professionals in Vienna suggested the true scale of the problem could be much higher. </p> <p>Prof Pavel Kabat, one of the lead authors of the water chapter in last year's report by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, said investment needed to rise to 1.5% of GDP for 20 years, just to cope with existing population demand and climate variability. Africa, the region with the greatest lack of infrastructure, would have to spend its entire forecast GDP growth for more than half a century even to reach relatively modest levels of water storage and supply; and even Europe would have to triple spending.</p> <p>Failure to invest would mean \"we'd have more recurrent floods and droughts because our systems are not able to take the magnitude and frequency of water we're witnessing,\" he said. It would also undermine other development spending in poorer nations, said Kabat, citing the example of Kenya, where he said two extreme years of wet and dry in the 1990s destroyed 40% of the country's wealth.</p> <p>\"If these things are not in place we can keep on building schools but we're not doing the right thing,\" he added.</p> <p>Among the proposals to reduce costs, water users would have to accept different grades of water, including a lower grade in gardens and toilets, said Professor Alexander Zehnder, of the Alberta Water Research Institute, Canada. \"Why are we spending a lot of money to clean the water and then we piss in it?\"</p> <p>Earlier this year the American Society of Civil Engineers said the US needed to spend $1.6tn over five years to repair all its crumbling infrastructure, and gave the worst assessment of all to the water sector. Federal funds for drinking water were less than 10% of what was needed.</p> <p>In the UK the Institution of Civil Engineers said that despite significant investment since water privatisation in 1989 many mains pipes were extremely old and in poor condition, and under-investment in new reservoirs had led to \"insufficient winter reserve storage to sustain supplies in extreme conditions\".</p> <p>Last year's floods in the UK exposed fears about the safety of a reservoir dam in Yorkshire, leading to 100 homes being evacuated. Yesterday the Chartered Institution of Water and Environmental Management warned that floods were having \"devastating\" health, social and economic consequences.</p> <p>\"Impacts can range from immediate death, injury and harm from contaminated water, through to lasting psychological consequences caused by damaged homes, loss of personal possessions and financial worries,\" said the London-based institution.</p> <h2>Brown Danube</h2> <p><strong>The Danube</strong></p> <p>Despite its role in European history, the Danube has been neglected. A report out today says that, despite improving, nearly half its 1,771-mile length fails to meet European Union standards. </p> <p>Many cities in former Soviet countries that line its banks do not treat waste water and flush the sewage of millions of residents straight into Europe's second-longest river and down to the Black Sea.</p> <p>The International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River, which has published the report, says more than 200 schemes costing \u20ac4.5bn (\u00a33.6bn) are needed just to treat waste water. Drinking water supply projects costing about half that much again are also required, said Philip Weller, the commission's executive secretary. </p> <p>But the affected countries are all in eastern Europe and do not have the money, he said. \"The hope is some of those investments will come from the European Union; some will have to come direct from the countries.\"</p> <p><strong>Africa</strong></p> <p>Water stress is defined as having less than 1,000 cubic meters of water a year per person. By this definition up to 2.1 million people already have too little, and population growth and more variable rainfall threaten to make this much worse.</p> <p>The problems are acute in south-east Asia and Africa, but Africa is least able to cope. Average US storage capability is 6,000 cubic metres; in China it is less than half of that and in many countries in Africa it is minuscule. To bring the region up to South Africa's level of nearly 750 cubic metres would need all the estimated 5%-7% rise in national income every year for up to 80 years.</p>",
  "<p>The Crown Prosecution Service announced yesterday that it would seek a retrial of seven men who were accused of plotting to explode liquid bombs aboard planes heading from London to north America. </p> <p>The decision came after a jury at Woolwich crown court failed to convict anyone over the alleged airlines conspiracy. The court had been told the plans amounted to the biggest terrorist plot since the September 11 attacks on the US.</p> <p>On Monday the jury acquitted one person, convicted three of an unspecified plot to murder using liquid bombs, and was hung on the central charge against seven men. </p> <p>In a statement, Sir Ken MacDonald, the director of public prosecutions, said: \"I have carefully considered this case with the head of my counter-terrorism division and with counsel. </p> <p>\"I have today concluded that the prosecution should apply to retry each of these defendants on every count that the recently discharged jury failed to agree upon. </p> <p>\"This will include a count that each defendant conspired to detonate improvised explosive devices on transatlantic passenger aircraft.</p> <p>\"We shall be returning to court to make this application in due course.\"</p> <p>The CPS has now applied for a hearing to restart the case.</p> <p>In effect the decision means the prosecution will start over again, although defence lawyers could try to challenge the decision to stage a retrial on some of the charges.</p> <p>The Crown had alleged that eight Britons conspired to blow up at least seven airliners heading to north America with 1,500 people aboard, in attacks that would have had a global impact.</p> <p>The jury convicted three men by a majority of 10 to two of conspiracy to murder.</p> <p>Those convicted were the alleged ringleader, Abdulla Ahmed Ali, 27, the alleged bomb-making expert, Assad Sarwar, 28, and cell member Tanvir Hussain, 27.</p> <p>Ali and Hussain had made suicide videos in which they made threats against the west. Hussain was also caught by a covert probe placed inside the east London flat the cell used as a bomb factory, drilling holes into drinks bottles into which the crown alleged parts of the liquid bomb would be inserted.</p> <p>One man, Mohammed Gulzar, who the crown alleged was to superintend the plot, was acquitted on all charges. He flew into Britain on a fake passport from South Africa.</p> <p>The jury failed to reach any verdicts on four men. They are Ibrahim Savant, 27, Arafat Waheed Khan, 27, Waheed Zaman, 24, and Umar Islam, 30.</p> <p>Those four had pleaded guilty to conspiracy to cause a public nuisance by making suicide videos, before the jury retired to consider their verdicts, and are also in custody awaiting sentence.</p> <p>All seven men, six from east London and one from High Wycombe, will be retried on a charge of conspiring to murder \"persons unknown by the detonation of improvised explosive devices on board transatlantic passenger aircraft\" between January 1 and August 11 2006. In addition Savant, Khan, Zaman and Islam will face a second charge of conspiracy to murder. </p> <p>The seven were due to reappear in court on October 3 for sentencing. The CPS said it was now up to the court when the fresh prosecutions would start.</p> <p>Counter-terrorism officials remain convinced of the veracity of the airlines plot, despite the fact the jury was unconvinced.</p> <p>The alleged plotters were arrested on August 9 2006, and the alleged conspiracy led to tight restrictions on what airline passengers could take on board planes in their hand luggage.</p>",
  "<p>Scientists are preparing to launch a new satellite to make more precise measurements of the Earth's gravitational field and so help improve predictions about global warming.</p> <p>The \u20ac330m (\u00a3265m) project aims to provide an extremely accurate map of the planet's gravitational field. Its main mission is to help climate scientists improve their predictions by enabling them to produce a more precise picture of the ocean currents.</p> <p>By comparing the surface shape of the oceans with the undulations in the gravitational field, scientists can arrive at a more accurate picture of the oceans' currents - the flows that transport vast amounts of heat around the planet and so have a profound impact on the global climate. </p> <p>The satellite will complete a map of the gravitational field once every 70 days and stay in operation for about 18 months. </p> <p>\"This isn't a scientific indulgence,\" Professor Marek Ziebart, of University College London, told this year's British Association Festival of Science, meeting in Liverpool. \"It's about predicting how the world is going to change.\"</p> <p>The torpedo-shaped satellite - known as the gravity field and steady-state ocean circulation explorer - was due to launch this week from the Plesetsk cosmodrome, about 500 miles north of Moscow. But engineers delayed takeoff for two weeks after problems with the guidance and navigation system. </p> <p>The satellite, when launched, will orbit from pole to pole at an altitude of about 160 miles. This is very low for satellites, but it needs to be close to the Earth to be able to measure minute fluctuations in gravity - about 10 million-millionths of the gravity we feel on Earth. To measure these the engineers developed sophisticated control mechanisms that dampen other forces acting on the spacecraft, including buffeting by cosmic rays.</p> <p>\"Whether the ocean surface is sloped or not is a very sensitive indicator of what the currents are doing,\" said Chris Hughes, at the Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory in Liverpool. He said that just a one-centimetre difference in ocean height generated a current flow of 1m cubic metres a second. </p> <p>The gravitational reference map will also have other applications. Geologists will use the map as a set of reference points to measure movements during earthquakes, for example. It will also be useful for tweaking satellite orbits and accurately surveying land.</p>",
  "<p>Six Greenpeace climate change activists have been cleared of causing \u00a330,000 of criminal damage at a coal-fired power station in a verdict that is expected to embarrass the government and lead to more direct action protests against energy companies.</p> <p>The jury of nine men and three women at Maidstone crown court cleared the six by a majority verdict. Five of the protesters had scaled a 200-metre chimney at Kingsnorth power station, Hoo, Kent, in October last year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337506384\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/pictures/2008/09/10/GordonChimney.jpg\" alt=\"Kingsnorth chimney\" width=\"220\" height=\"330\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Greenpeace activists on the painted chimney October 8 2008. Photograph: Will Rose/Greenpeace</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The activists admitted trying to shut down the station by occupying the smokestack and painting the word \"Gordon\" down the chimney, but argued that they were legally justified because they were trying to prevent climate change causing greater damage to property around the world. It was the first case in which preventing property damage caused by climate change had been used as part of a \"lawful excuse\" defence in court. It is now expected to be used more widely by environment groups. </p> <p>In his summing-up at the end of an eight-day trial, the judge, David Caddick, said the case centred on whether or not the protesters had a lawful excuse for their actions. He told the jury that for this defence to be used it had to be proved that the action was due to an immediate need to protect property belonging to another.</p> <p>He said allowance for demonstrations did not extend to breaking the law and the jury's task was to examine the boundary line represented by the lawful excuse and to evaluate whether the defendants had crossed the line. He also warned the jury to put aside any feelings towards Greenpeace, climate change or fuel companies during their deliberations. </p> <p>John Price, prosecuting, had earlier argued that the protesters' actions were \"not capable of being lawful\". He said: \"There are things you can lawfully do in making a protest but there's a line which has to be drawn. When the defendants caused damage to that chimney, it's the line that they crossed.\"</p> <p>The court had heard from Professor Jim Hansen, one of the world's leading climate scientists, that the 20,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emitted daily by Kingsnorth could be responsible for the extinction of up to 400 species. Hansen, a Nasa director who advises Al Gore, the former US presidential candidate turned climate change campaigner, told the court that humanity was in \"grave peril\". \"Somebody needs to step forward and say there has to be a moratorium, draw a line in the sand and say no more coal-fired power stations.\"</p> <p>It also heard David Cameron's environment adviser, millionaire environmentalist Zac Goldsmith, and an Inuit leader from Greenland both say climate change was already seriously affecting life around the world. Goldsmith told the court: \"By building a coal-power plant in this country, it makes it very much harder [to exert] pressure on countries like China and India\" to reduce their burgeoning use of the fossil fuel.</p> <p>The court was told that some of the property in immediate need of protection included parts of Kent at risk from rising sea levels, the Pacific island state of Tuvalu and areas of Greenland. The defendants also cited the Arctic ice sheet, China's Yellow River region, the Larsen B ice shelf in Antarctica, coastal areas of Bangladesh and the city of New Orleans.</p> <p>The jury was told that Kingsnorth emitted the same amount of carbon dioxide as the 30 least polluting countries in the world combined - and that there were advanced plans to build a new coal-fired power station next to the existing site on the Hoo peninsula.</p> <p>Greenpeace used the court's decision to put pressure on the government to abandon plans for a new generation of coal-fired plants. \"Today's acquittal is a potent challenge to the government's plans for new coal-fired stations from jurors representing ordinary people in Britain who, after hearing the evidence, supported the right to take direct action in order to protect the climate,\" said Ben Stewart, the group's communications director and one of the six acquitted. The others were Will Rose, Kevin Drake, Tim Hewke, Huw Williams and Emily Hall.</p> <p>\"It wasn't only us in the dock, it was coal-fired power generation as well,\" said Hall. \"The only people left in Britain who think new coal is a good idea are business secretary John Hutton and the energy minister Malcolm Wicks. It's time the prime minister stepped in and embraced a clean energy future for Britain.\"</p> <h2>Winning causes</h2> <p>In the last 12 years, court cases involving GM crops and nuclear, chemical and arms companies collapsed after protesters said they had followed their consciences and had been trying to prevent a greater crime.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <strong>2000</strong> Norwich jury found Greenpeace director Lord Melchett and 27 activists not guilty of causing criminal damage to field of GM crops</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <strong>2000</strong> Five Greenpeace volunteers found not guilty of criminal damage after occupying incinerator </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <strong>1999</strong> Three women cleared of causing \u00a380,000 damage to Trident nuclear submarine computer equipment</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <strong>1996</strong> Liverpool jury acquitted four women who caused \u00a31.5m damage to Hawk fighter jet at British Aerospace factory</p>",
  "<p>The global economic slowdown has put the brakes on executive pay and ended a long period of rapidly accelerating earnings as the good times rolled, the Guardian's annual survey of directors' pay has revealed.</p> <p>But the research exposes a growing gap between the executives of Britain's leading companies and a super-wealthy elite at the top of the earnings pile whose salaries continue to stretch ahead.</p> <p>It found that 34 directors out of 956 in the FTSE 100 index of companies enjoyed packages of salary, bonuses and shares of more than \u00a35m, up from 20 directors in the previous year. Eight directors earned more than \u00a310m and three took home more than \u00a320m.</p> <p>This compares with the average chief executive's package which slipped slightly to \u00a32.8m in 2007, from \u00a32.9m earned on average in the previous year. The amount paid to other executive directors fell from an average \u00a31.8m to \u00a31.4m.</p> <p>For the first time last year, the Guardian also surveyed rewards for directors in the second tier of companies, the FTSE 250, where eight executives earned over \u00a35m and 36 took home more than \u00a33m. However, the average chief executive's pay for these companies was much lower at \u00a31.45m.</p> <p>The Institute of Fiscal Studies said recently that income inequality last year was the highest since records began in 1961 and that incomes at the very top had been \"racing away\" from the rest of society.</p> <p>The findings of The Guardian/Reward Technology Forum survey were line with a report from the consultants Deloitte earlier this month, which found that the credit crunch had slowed the pay rises of all but the very top bosses. </p> <p>The financial crisis, which began over a year ago, is showing no sign of abatement and could have a similar impact this year as earnings are squeezed and bonus targets missed.</p> <p>Although chief executive salaries levelled off last year, they were still well ahead of the average \u00a32.2m earned in 2005.</p> <p>The average worker in Britain last year made a fraction over \u00a324,000 and had a pay rise of 3.6%. Inflation last year, including mortgage payments, was 4.3%, which means that, in effect, many ordinary workers took a pay cut.</p> <p>According to the Guardian survey, the highest paid employees in a UK public company work for the private equity group 3i, where the average salary was \u00a3231,000, up from \u00a3170,000 just two years ago.</p> <p>Despite the slowdown in average salaries of chief executives, a \"winner takes all\" culture is increasingly prevalent in the boardroom, according to Nick Isles, director of advocacy at the Work Foundation thinktank. </p> <p>\"The differential between chief executives and ordinary workers is increasingly mirroring the US, although we are not quite there yet,\" he said. \"In Britain in 1970, the average chief executive earned 10 times an ordinary worker. The differential is now well over a hundred to one. It is utterly astonishing and defies all normal laws of economics.\"</p> <p>In the past five years executives running the biggest companies in the country have increasingly been lavished with American-style pay packages.</p> <p>In 2002, there were only six directors in the FTSE 100 earning more than \u00a35m. To make it into the top 10 list that year, Lord Browne, who was boss of BP, earned \u00a33.9m. This year, the tenth best paid executive was Brad Mills, who made \u00a38.2m running the mining group Lonmin. Anyone earning \u00a33.9m this year would be ranked 43rd. </p> <p>There were 70 FTSE directors earning more than \u00a33m last year, compared with 62 in 2006 and 35 in 2005.</p> <p>Investors have tended to ignore the large increases in executive pay as long as share prices are also going up. But some evidence exists this year of patience wearing thin as some companies, such as Cable &amp; Wireless, have adopted \"private equity\" style pay schemes. The Barclays president, Bob Diamond, came under fire for the size of his pay packet at the bank's annual meeting in April.</p> <p>Salaries at the top of public companies have partly been accelerating because of the culture of massive pay that has been fostered among the hedge funds, private equity firms and investment banks in the City - firms that are either privately owned or quoted in the United States or Europe and fall outside of the Guardian data.</p> <p>Paul Kenny, GMB general secretary, said: \"This Guardian survey shows that no one, not the shareholders, not politicians, nor consumers, is exercising any restraint on the growth in pay to top bosses and the multimillionaire elite who run the financial system.\"</p> <p>The highest paid directors are clustered in the financial services industry and in the mining sector, which is riding a five-year boom in metals prices as China, India and other emerging markets undergo massive construction programmes.</p>",
  "<p>In 2006, the Environment Agency published a poll of its top 100 eco-heroes of all time. Next to Charles Darwin was the name of Tony Bradshaw, a pioneer of restoration ecology, who has died aged 82. That juxtaposition was stunningly appropriate, for Tony made his name as an evolutionary biologist. His work on the evolution of tolerance to heavy metals in plants growing in contaminated soils remains the clearest and best example of evolution in action, and Darwin would have applauded it. </p> <p>Where Tony left his academic colleagues in the shade was by applying that brilliant, fundamental research to the restoration of vegetation and functioning ecosystems to derelict land, first on mine sites in Wales and later in his adopted city of Liverpool and world-wide. His ability to move seamlessly between the worlds of fundamental and applied science may now be more common, but in the 1960s and 70s was unusual and even disdained by some.</p> <p>The son of an architect, Tony was born in Kew, Surrey, and was interested in plants from an early age. As a 13-year-old at the outbreak of the second world war, he dug for victory - literally. The entire front garden of the family house was turned over to vegetables under his care, despite being on heavy clay. Perhaps that experience seeded his lifelong interest in making soil in unlikely places. </p> <p>After graduating in botany at Jesus College, Cambridge, in 1947, he moved to the University College of Wales, first as a research student in Aberystwyth and then as a lecturer at Bangor. His work on metal tolerance was outstanding. He demonstrated the power of natural selection to bring about rapid evolutionary changes in natural grasses, even when the populations were separated by only very short distances, which conventional theory at the time regarded as impossible because gene flow between the populations was thought to swamp the disruptive effects of selection. Consequently, locally adapted races could evolve easily.</p> <p>Tony quickly saw the potential of this discovery to help restore polluted soils. In 1968 he took the chair of botany at Liverpool University, and the range of degraded environments covered by his lab expanded quickly. Spoil heaps from coal, slate and china clay mines, limestone quarries, metal wastes, the bare margins of reservoirs and urban dereliction all fell under his gaze. </p> <p>The key to his work was creating soil on these damaged sites without resorting to the then standard technique of importing topsoil at great expense (and at great damage to the source of the soil). Consequently, huge areas of land could be restored to health because the costs of doing so were so low. His work on the revegetation of china clay tips in Cornwall formed the basis of the techniques behind the Eden Project. </p> <p>His international reputation grew quickly, but he never lost touch with his team's research. Even when head of a large department, he would happily spend a day on site with a research student, spade in hand and inspiration flowing. In 1982 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, and other honours followed, including the presidency of the British Ecological Society, of which he was made an honorary member in 1988.</p> <p>Tony was involved with many environmental organisations, including the first Groundwork Trust, set up in St Helens, Merseyside, in 1981 as a partnership between the then Countryside Commission and local authorities to work with the community to bring about environmental change and the consequent social and economic benefits. </p> <p>The model was so successful that there are now more than 50 Groundwork Trusts in the UK, focused on communities where environmental dereliction goes hand-in-hand with social and economic deprivation, and has been replicated worldwide. In Britain, the movement has given rise to the Land Restoration Trust.</p> <p>Many other bodies were given his generous support, ranging from the Merseyside Environmental Trust (of which he was the founding chairman and later president) to the National Urban Forestry Unit, the National Wildflower Centre (again, he was its founding chair) and the Eden Project. He helped set up the Institute for Ecology and Environmental Management, a professional body for ecologists, and was its first president. He was awarded its gold medal last year.</p> <p>He published more than 250 works, not just in mainstream scientific journals. His book The Restoration of Land (1980), written jointly with Mike Chadwick, was the standard text on the subject, mixing science and practice fluently, and Trees in the Urban Landscape (1995) set the same standards for those much abused \"friends of the city\".</p> <p>Tony's greatest legacy, however, is in the people he inspired. He was an outstanding teacher with a rare combination of clarity and enthusiasm. He supervised more than 60 postgraduate research students from all over the world, most of whom have continued in research and related posts. He was an exceptionally gifted supervisor, knowing exactly when to intervene and when to let a student have free rein, and his students learned from him that research could simultaneously be scientifically rigorous, socially valuable and great fun. </p> <p>Tony married Betty Alliston in 1955, and they had three daughters, Jane, Penny and Sarah. When Betty died in 2000, Tony stayed in Liverpool and continued to devote his knowledge and experience to the city, and helped transform its oldest public park, St James Gardens. Shortly before he died, he was made Liverpool's first citizen of honour.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Anthony David Bradshaw, evolutionary biologist and restoration ecologist, born January 17 1926; died August 21 2008</p>",
  "<p>I never thought I would spend my honeymoon on other people's couches in London, but that's what happened after my husband and I got kicked out of our flat. In three months, our energy bills trebled and so did the prices at our local supermarket. Freelance clients weren't paying, cash flow became non-existent, choices had to be made between eating and paying the rent. We chose eating. Our landlord asked us to leave. What I didn't realise was that we would be entering an emerging group of full-time couch surfers; people who have found a more communal, environmentally friendly, even utopian, way of living.</p> <p>We are not homeless. We have choices. We are not sleeping rough. But, right now, we don't have a fixed address. And, strangely enough, after eight years in the UK, I finally feel settled. Maybe it's my itinerant roots. My grandmother started her career as a migrant worker in the orange groves of Florida. Later, when she had her own farm, there was always an extra person or two sleeping in the shed. And, there have been times over the past 20 years when I have been without an address, for mostly economic reasons. In the late 1980s, when petrol was cheaper than rent, I spent three months driving across America and staying with friends. But this time, it feels more permanent.</p> <p>For the past four weeks, we have been staying with Spencer and Nicola and their two children Oscar and Maud, in London. We live in their lounge, which they have cleared out for us. Most evenings, the six of us pile into Spencer and Nicola's bedroom to watch TV. Maud sometimes practises her cello and Oscar is learning Sweet Child O' Mine on the electric guitar. There is always tea and biscuits, and fresh eggs (the children are rearing two free-range chickens in the back garden). </p> <p>Communal dwellers? Semi-permanent couch surfers? Whatever you call people like us, we are growing in number. We live for free in sheds, spare rooms and lounges, sometimes rotating, sometimes staying for months. We share resources, and pay our hosts in chores and skills. The UK homeless charity Crisis estimates that nearly 400,000 people are classified as hidden homeless, and that this figure will rise to more than a million by 2020. Of these, nearly 150,000 are living in concealed households, that is, staying with family, friends or acquaintances. It is difficult to estimate how many of these people are forced into this situation, but for some it is becoming a lifestyle choice.</p> <p>As a travel phenomenon, couch surfing has exploded over the past two years, with websites such as <a href=\"http://www.couchsurfing.com\">couchsurfing.com</a> that hooks up travellers with locals, who provide free accommodation. An average of 9,000 people per week have signed up to couchsurfing.com since January, and there have been over a half a million successful surfs. Although surfers generally go in for short-term holidays, there are some who just keep moving.</p> <p>\"We have been travelling for two and a half years now,\" says Alex Kiriak, who classifies herself as a nomadic and semi-permanent couch surfer. Lara Cappelletti has been house-free for more than five years. \"Giving up a permanent address releases you from an enormous amount of responsibility, and paves the way for a more simple, stress-free life,\" she says. \"For more than two years now, strangers have opened the doors to their homes and this lifestyle has changed me for ever.\"</p> <p>Another semi-permanent free-housing situation that has been around since the early 1970s is Wwoof-ing. Formerly an acronym for Working Weekends on Organic Farms, it now stands for World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms, and is a programme administered by Lili (Low-Impact Living Initiative) in Buckinghamshire. Farmers offer free accommodation and food in exchange for your helping hands. \"There are people out there who Wwoof pretty much permanently,\" says Scarlett Penn, contracts manager. \"Some of them stay with one host for a long period and become part of the furniture, while others move around more regularly, picking up knowledge and experience along the way.\" She believes there are significantly more Wwoof-ers than this time last year: \"About 50% more.\"</p> <p>Ben (not his real name)*, 36, an artist from Manchester, has been couch surfing for two years. He helped his first \"host family\" de-clutter their three-bedroom south London home, and managed the redesign of their loft space. \"I coordinated with the builders and acted as project manager. At the same time, I was able to work on projects of my own that I couldn't have done if I was working to pay the rent. The two guys I lived with travelled a lot with their work and didn't have that kind of flexibility.\" Ben got free <br>accommodation and his hosts increased the value of their house with his help. </p> <p>Now he is living with a long-time friend, who has just had her second child and is about to return to work. Her husband works full-time, so Ben will help with the childcare. \"The dynamic of three adults is 10 times more useful than that of two, especially if kids are involved,\" he says. He also stresses the environmental benefits of communal living. \"Do we really need that much space? I share a lot of resources with my friend's family: the car, petrol, insurance, energy and food.\" </p> <p>Ben thinks the trend will continue as the housing market slumps, and people become more concerned about the environment. \"Maybe this is the new social housing. Instead of the council putting you up, it's your friends. And if you can find non-monetary ways to pay them back - that works for everybody.\"</p> <p>As for the host families, Nicola says they get a lot out of having people stay. \"It helps the children to be open-minded and prepares them for the world out there,\" she says. She doesn't like British attitudes towards owning property. \"We are a community, we should have people coming into our houses. It creates memories and shared experiences.\" </p> <p>Next month we are moving to New Orleans and we have already set up the first two months of surfing. There is an ideology forming here: of freedom and mobility. Less impact on the environment through shared resources. Less impact on the bank account. Helping each other. A bit hippy perhaps, but with rising living costs and a rapidly changing climate, maybe it's time for that again.</p> <p>* This article was amended on Thursday September 11 2008.

  "<p>So farewell then ITV. Britain's largest commercial broadcaster yesterday lost its place among the top 100 British companies. It's a slap in the face for executive chairman Michael Grade - whose share package does not start paying out until the shares hit 135p - and bad news for Sky, which bought its 17.9% stake at that level in November 2006.</p> <p>The question being asked now is whether it will ever get back into the FTSE 100 or whether it will succumb to a takeover within the next few months. The shares, up 3p at 48.8p, were the day's biggest riser among the blue chips yesterday - too late to prevent relegation - as traders played a game of hunt the bidder. </p> <p>The Competition Commission ruled late last year that Sky must scale its stake down to less than 7.5%. Sky appealed against that decision to the competition appeal tribunal back in June. While waiting for the judgment, Sky has been approached by a number of companies interested in snapping up the stake as a prelude to a bid.</p> <p>Away from the media goldfish bowl, Carphone Warehouse, which closed down 7.2p at 192.3p, is also being relegated from the FTSE 100 as is pubs group Enterprise Inns, which closed down 30.7p at 234.25p - the day's biggest blue chip loser - after Morgan Stanley dropped its recommendation to underweight from equal weight. The last of the four companies relegated is mining group Ferrexpo, down 7.1p at 165p, index compilers FTSE confirmed after the market closed yesterday.</p> <p>In their place will come satellite operator Inmarsat - up 7p at 536p - Stagecoach - down 1p at 312.25p - silver producer and the first Mexican company to float on London's main market Fresnillo - down 13.5p at 339p - and software group Autonomy - down 8p at \u00a310.42. The index of top 100 firms they will be joining on September 22, closed down 49.4 points at 5366.2 yesterday as banking and mining stocks dipped lower, the former because of continuing worries about the state of the global financial sector in the wake of Lehman Brothers' woes, the latter because of expectations of slowing demand as recession bites in developed countries. </p> <p>In fact, on Wall Street the Dow Jones industrial average was up about 90 points when London closed due to relief that Lehman Brothers was not in worse shape. But this side of the Atlantic, Barclays lost 19.2p to 346.5p with HSBC down 3.75p at 902.5p.</p> <p>Among the mining stocks, BHP Billiton dropped 20p to \u00a313.85 with Xstrata down 133p at \u00a322.25. Lonmin dropped 9p to \u00a330.66 after South African mining group Aquarius Platinum denied it was seeking to launch a counter-bid for the group.</p>",
  "<p>Can Opec defend an oil price of $100 a barrel? Yesterday the cartel, after its meeting in Vienna, seemed to signal that it wants to try. A cut in production of 500,000 barrels a day is tiny (about 0.6% of global production) but the tone of the communique was hawkish - it described the oil market as over-supplied. That sounded like a threat to reduce production further, through the formal mechanism of quotas, if prices continue to fall. </p> <p>Yet the price of a barrel of Brent barely budged; it was back below $100 by the afternoon. The market clearly doubts Opec's ability to put a floor under prices after the fall from July's peak of $147. Consumption in the US fell sharply over the summer; autumn is traditionally the slow season for oil; and colder economic breezes are reaching Asia, source of the growth in demand for oil. So maybe Opec's stance was weaker than it appeared - after all, the heavy gun of quota cuts wasn't rolled out.</p> <p>Predicting the oil market is a mug's game. A year ago, the idea that prices might soon hit $147 a barrel seemed silly. It seems equally likely that prices could overshoot on the way down - especially as Opec has advertised its concern that global recession will destroy demand. That's not a position of strength.</p> <p><strong>Lehman bravado</strong></p> <p>It's a miracle. Lehman Brothers doesn't need new capital or new investors.</p> <p>The message was not the one Wall Street was expecting to hear. Nor was it simple. It seems that the sale of a 55% stake in the investment management business, plus a spin-off of the poisonous commercial property assets into a separate vehicle, can allow a \"core\" Lehman to emerge. There was an odd-looking goodwill write-back in there to help the calculations but you get the picture: Lehman thinks it can muddle through in a slimmed-down version.</p> <p>Chief executive Dick Fuld claimed his staff (the ones who are left) are \"holding wonderfully\" and that clients are supportive. He has to say that, but the harsh reality is that a wounded investment bank is a vulnerable creature on Wall Street. Rivals pick off top talent and a shrinking bank finds itself with less financial firepower. A takeover looks the most likely outcome.</p> <p><strong>Hedged in</strong></p> <p>Investors in RAB Capital's Special Situations hedge fund thought life was bad last week, when they were told that the value of their investment was down 37.5% this year. Yesterday, after adding up the latest numbers and reviewing the unlisted portfolio, RAB told them that the fall is now 48%.</p> <p>Cue a rush for the exit, you might assume. But RAB wants to bolt the door. It is asking investors, who include the steel billionaire Lakshmi Mittal, to agree to lock up their money for three years. In return, it will reduce its fees.</p> <p>The lock-in proposal may well succeed. Philip Richards, the fund's manager, is best known for his bad bet on Northern Rock, but his fund is really stuffed with small mining and resource stocks. Selling these into a falling commodity market risks instantly turning a 48% loss into something much worse. Thus the invitation to ride the downturn and await the upturn. The fund's wealthy backers (minimum investment: $50,000) may well look kindly on Richards' long-term record (a 17-fold return since 2003, even after this year's shocker) and let him carry on. </p> <p>But RAB's woes also reveal the wider ones of the battalion of hedge funds operating in the commodity field. Investors, having enjoyed the boom, want out. US manager Ospraie has pulled the plug of one of its big commodity funds. The providers of hedge funds' debt, the investment banks, don't want another black hole to appear and are imposing tougher terms. We're seeing a spiral of selling, and it shows no sign yet of slowing. Expect more casualties.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:nils.pratley@theguardian.com\">nils.pratley@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Sharply declining sales were reported by two of the biggest names on Britain's high streets yesterday: clothing store group Next and Comet, the freezer, vacuum cleaner and TV retailer.</p> <p>Comet, which operates about 250 stores in Britain, will now make a loss for the six months to the end of October, according to parent company Kesa Electricals. The division had shown a profit of \u00a343m for the year to April 30.</p> <p>Kesa chief executive Jean-No\u00ebl Labroue noted profits from the UK chain were always much lower for the first half of the year and insisted he was confident it would turn a profit by the year end.</p> <p>He was speaking after announcing a comparable sales drop at Comet for the three months to July 31 of 9.9% and a decline in margin of one percentage point. The falls were much steeper than investors had expected and Kesa shares last night closed down 15.46p, or almost 10%, at 142.5p. The company had not updated investors on trading performance figures for any period since the April year-end.</p> <p>\"There seems to be a profit warning here, though it isn't spelled out,\" said Philip Dorgan, an analyst at Panmure Gordon. \"Investors don't have to own a European consumer electricals business and we suggest they don't.\"</p> <p>Margin was hit in part because sales declines were steepest in traditionally lucrative \"white goods\" - fridges, freezers and washing machines. Labroue said sales of these products were down between 12% and 13%.</p> <p>Adding to Comet's woes, rival chain Currys, which is part of the stockmarket-listed DSG International, started a price war on televisions before the Beijing Olympics. Forced to respond, margins at Comet were further eroded. </p> <p>Labroue said he was confident of rebuilding profitability levels and hitting the target of a decline of half a percentage point by the year-end. He was less than clear on the detail of how this would be achieved. \"I am sorry not to have a magic stick on this,\" he said. Kesa noted the trading environment across the European markets in which it operates had deteriorated since April.</p> <p>Meanwhile, a 6% decline in comparable half-year full-price sales at Next was well anticipated - if not altogether welcomed - by investors. Chief executive Simon Wolfson said for more than two years he had been preparing the business for a sharp drop in consumer spending, which had duly arrived. Judicious stock planning meant volumes discounted at the end of spring/summer season sale were down 20% on the previous year.</p> <p>Yesterday Wolfson made clear he felt a recovery in spending power for his customers was still a long way off. </p> <p>\"It is important to prepare the business not just for another six months of difficult times but for another 18 months of difficult times. There is very little that we see that will reduce the pressure on our consumers.\"</p> <p>Next made pre-tax profit of \u00a3174m for the six months to July, down 12.4%. A \u00a352m share buy-back programme limited the decline in earnings per share to 2.8%. Shares in Next closed down 23p at \u00a311.20.</p>",
  "<p>I have been watching a trailer for Chelsey OMG, a TV series for 16- to 25-year-olds to be shown next month on the social network Bebo, which has more than 80 million users. It is full-length for its genre - three minutes an episode. This is so as not to strain the attention-span of today's teenies and it allows episodes to be viewed secretly at work without reducing the nation's productivity. </p> <p>Chelsey, a young American, has landed in planet London trying to navigate her way among dysfunctional people, helped by suggestions from the audience. It is full of interactivity, including intrusions into real lives with the option for viewers to become \"friends\" of the stars. If it takes off after a few episodes, the production company Channel X will know the numbers watching - including what sort of people they are - so they can try to finance the rest of it through a sponsor. The dream is that it will run and run, becoming a web hit then a film and then a book as the fairy tale is completed.</p> <p>I have no idea whether it will succeed. It is the latest of a growing number of Generation Web soaps - cue in MySpace's Quarterlife and Endemol's The Gap Year, for a start - as the net becomes a medium for television. If kids won't go to the television set then television must come to them wherever they are - probably networking on Facebook, MySpace or Bebo. There may be a lesson for newspapers here.</p> <p>These programmes are not made with Hollywood budgets. They are created increasingly by people who honed their skills at home in the polytechnic of YouTube and cut their teeth on very low budgets and self-taught skills. The next David Puttnam will probably come from one of these serials or from the exploding number of web television channels. The trend to routing television through the internet covers so many activities that it is difficult to put a single label on it. One of the leading trendsetters is the BBC, partly through using Bebo and other channels but overwhelmingly through the astonishing success of its iPlayer - 21m requests in August - enabling anyone in the UK to replay radio or TV programmes from the previous seven days in an impressively user-friendly way. Web TV also covers watching television using a Nintendo Wii console, where the programme is routed through the internet before it appears on a regular TV set. For a list of numerous TV channels that you can see on the web go to viewmy.tv.</p> <p>But the really interesting things are happening where users are creating their own programmes and then either uploading them to YouTube and vodpod (the easy option) or choosing one of an exploding number of sites that provide you with your own global channel (usually for free) on mobile, PC or both. These include sites such as Kyte, hulu.com (fast-rising but only available in the US), wi-fitv.com (enabling you to buy a social station), magnify.net, mogulus.com and the UK's worldtv.com which, when linked to the mobile channel qik, enables you to put live footage from the video camera on a smartphone directly on to your own global tv channel.</p> <p>None of these are certain to succeed. Often the more amazing the technology, the less likely it is to triumph. It is almost preposterous that so many sites are offering us a free global television channel. Even a few years ago, that would have cost millions. But as digital cameras and cameraphones get better and cheaper, the scope for a whole new genre of creativity is enormous. At the moment progress is held back partly by the newness of it all (hence some of the dross on YouTube), the lack of a route to hook into all the advertising revenue that is migrating to the web (though that is starting to be solved) and, despite YouTube, the lack of a suitable aggregator to enable your channel to be known to potential users. The big breakthrough may come with mobile phones, as three-minute films are ideal for them. There is a fortune to be made there by someone.</p>",
  "<p>The American defence secretary, Robert Gates, has cancelled a rerun of the competition for a $35bn (\u00a320bn) contract for a new aerial refuelling tanker for the US airforce.</p> <p>He told Congress a decision on a new fleet of tankers to provide inflight refuelling could not be reached by January and would be better left to the next administration.</p> <p>The decision is a blow to the consortium of Northrop Grumman and the European plane maker EADS, which had originally been awarded the contract, but offers another chance to Boeing, which had complained about the initial deal with the US-European consortium.</p> <p>Gates said yesterday: \"It has now become clear that the solicitation and award process cannot be accomplished by January. Thus, I believe that rather than hand the next administration an incomplete and possibly contested process, we should cleanly defer this procurement to the next team.\"</p> <p>Northrop Grumman and EADS won the original tender with an offering based on the Airbus A330 aircraft, only to find the award subjected to a rerun after the US government accountability office found the airforce had made \"significant errors\" in evaluating rival bids.</p> <p>Gates, who was given the job of deciding the outcome of the rerun competition, told the house armed services committee: \"It is my judgment that, in the time remaining to us, we cannot complete a competition that will be viewed as fair and competitive in this highly charged environment.\"</p> <p>He added that a cooling-off period would allow the next administration to take an objective view of the military requirements.</p> <p>Northrop Grumman said it was \"extremely disappointed\" by the decision.</p> <p>Brandon \"Randy\" Belote III, Northrop Grumman's vice-president for strategic communications, said: \"The department of defence, as recently as last week, stated the urgency to replace the Eisenhower-era fleet of refuelling tankers. With this delay, it is conceivable that our war fighters will be forced to fly tankers as old as 80 years of age.</p> <p>\"Northrop Grumman entered this competition in good faith and proposed the most modern, most capable tanker available, at the best value to the American taxpayer. While we understand, we are greatly concerned about the potential future implications for the defence acquisition process.\"</p> <p>Boeing welcomed the decision to have a new competition. The company said in a statement that it \"believes that it will best serve the war fighter in allowing the appropriate time for this important and complex procurement to be conducted in a thorough and open competition. This will assure delivery of the right tanker to the airforce and serve the best interests of the American taxpayer.</p> <p>\"In the meantime, the Boeing team will continue to support the air force in helping to keep the current KC-135 fleet flying their missions safely and reliably.\"</p>",
  "<p>Sir Martin Sorrell is no stranger to the Guardian's executive pay survey. The boss of the world's second largest advertising group was one of the pioneers of share-based performance plans in the 1990s and having clocked up over 20 years at the helm, he has seen several of these mammoth schemes pay out. He last topped the pay league in 2005 with a package worth \u00a353m. </p> <p>The maturing of the latest three-year share scheme - called the \"leadership equity acquisition plan\" or \"Leap\" - has catapulted him to the top of this year's table with a pay packet worth more than \u00a323m. This means that Sorrell's accumulated pay over the past five years tops \u00a380m. WPP is Sorrell's empire and Sorrell's vision. Having quit as finance director of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi - the epitome of a 1980s advertising firm - in 1985, Sorrell alighted on a small Kent-based maker of wire baskets as the basis for realising his dream of building a global marketing services firm. Wire and Plastic Products - which has branched out in to a range of bathroom and kitchen accessories - is still part of the company, but Sorrell used its listing on the London Stock Exchange as a springboard for a series of acquisitions that created a company now worth more than \u00a35.7bn.</p> <p>His first big deal, in 1987, was a $566m swoop on J Walter Thompson, home to the eponymous ad agency as well as a public relations firm, Hill and Knowlton. He followed that up with the acquisition of the Ogilvy Group for $864m two years later and although his dealmaking took WPP perilously close to collapse in the 1990s, he pulled it back from the brink to snatch Young &amp; Rubicam at the height of the dotcom boom. WPP now employs more than 110,000 people and last year generated revenues of more than \u00a36bn.</p> <p>Despite being 63, Sorrell shows little signs of wanting to hand over the reins of the business. This year has seen him gatecrash market research firm TNS's cosy nil-premium merger with its German rival GfK. After approaching the TNS board three times with his own counter-offer, Sorrell has gone hostile and put his \u00a31.1bn cash-and-shares bid direct to shareholders.</p> <p>Success would help WPP regain the position it held earlier this decade and leapfrog Omnicom into first place in the advertising market. Analysts believe the deal makes sense as WPP lacks scale in the market research sector. As a result of Sorrrell's aggressive move, GfK and TNS pulled their merger and the German company last week gave up trying to get the cash together for its own full-scale bid, leaving Sorrell's bid as the only viable offer on the table.</p> <h2>Bart Becht</h2> <p>As well as being one of the highest paid chief executives on the FTSE 100, Becht, who runs Reckitt Benckiser, also manages to maintain one of the lowest profiles. Born in Rotterdam, he was been at the Dutch firm Benckiser since 1988, becoming chief executive in 1995 and leading the merger with British company Reckitt &amp; Colman four years later. He has focused the business on \"power brands\" including Harpic, Cillit Bang, Dettol, Nurofen and Vanish. In 2007 it made profits of close to \u00a31.2bn, a 39% increase on the year before. Even with that performance, his enormous salary has not escaped criticism. The fund management group F&amp;C picked out his pay as one of the most contentious issues of the year in its 2007 Responsible Investment Report.</p> <h2>Bob Diamond</h2> <p>An ardent Chelsea fan, Bob Diamond is a former teacher who has shot to prominence in the banking industry and as president of Barclays has become one of the highest paid executives on the board of major company. One of nine children, Diamond grew up in Concord, Massachusetts. After following his parents into teaching, he became a bond trader at investment bank Morgan Stanley, and later joined Credit Suisse. In 1996 he joined Barclays when it was battling to restructure its troubled investment banking arm, but was not appointed to the board until 2005 when his pay became public for the first time. This year his total pay is boosted further by a \u00a314.8m \"retained incentive opportunity\" based on three-year performance targets.</p> <h2>Mick Davis</h2> <p>Known in the mining industry as \"Big Mick\" and regarded by many as \"punchy\", Davis has built Xstrata from a small Swiss company worth \u00a3250m into one of the biggest natural resources groups in the world. Davis, aged 50, was finance director of BHP Billiton but quit when he failed to secure the top job at the mining business. He assumed control of Xstrata in 2001, raised \u00a31bn through a floation in London a year later and went about acquiring assets at breakneck speed, developing a reputation for the company as one of the most aggressive in the sector. Davis has donned the tin hat again this year in a \u00a35bn hostile takeover bid for Lonmin. His pay package adds up to a total of \u00a313.95m.</p> <h2>Stanley Fink</h2> <p>One of the best known figures in the hedge fund industry, Fink is appearing among the ranks of the best paid FTSE directors for the last time, at least for now. After 21 years at Man Group, the world's largest listed hedge fund manager, Fink quit the business in July to spend more time on charitable work and other commercial interests. He bowed out on a high as the firm reported profits of $2bn (\u00a31.13bn). As well as being among the highest paid directors in the FTSE he owns shares in Man valued at around \u00a360m when he left. Fink, 50, is chairman of the Evelina Children's Hospital appeal and ARK (Absolute Return for Kids), a children's charity supported by hedge fund managers. He also sponsors a city academy school, Burlington Danes.</p> <h2>Tom Glocer</h2> <p>Glocer, 48, was the first person without a background in journalism to take the top job at Reuters, as well as the first American to run the news and financial information group, when he took over as chief executive in 2001. He managed to hang on to the top job after agreeing an \u00a38.7bn takeover of the company by Canadian rival Thomson last year. This year his salary will be boosted by a \u00a327m windfall from the takeover. Glocer has a degree in political philosophy from Columbia University and a graduate law degree from Yale Law School - he was a lawyer advising on mergers and acquisitions before joining Reuters in 1993 as deputy counsel for Reuters America. He is married to a former Miss Finland and they have two children.</p>",
  "<p>My eldest daughter turns five in December, and so, according to the normal order of things, this should be a momentous week in our house. The week in which she starts school. All around the country, her peers are putting on uniforms for the first time, turning up to classrooms, saying goodbye to their parents and embarking on the long, long road of academic endeavour. </p> <p>Instead, on Monday morning, after a leisurely breakfast, she put on her wellies and went outside to play.<br><br>This week we began home schooling, or as many pointedly prefer to call it, home education. It is something we've been thinking about for a long time, and something I wrote about on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/mortarboard/2008/feb/08/homeschoolingshouldwetake\">this blog</a> a few months ago. </p> <p>We never actually took the final decision to home educate, but time has overtaken our deliberations, September has rolled around, and here we are. </p> <p>Of course, we weren't quite as helpless as that, and we could have sent her to school. That would have been the easiest thing to do. We live in rural Somerset, there are lots of \"good\" state schools nearby. There would certainly have been fewer questions and puzzled expressions from family and friends to deal with. There would be less responsibility on our shoulders. We'd feel more normal. </p> <p>Part of me would have liked that. It would have brought back memories of when I started school. We'd be fulfilling one of the standard parenting rites of passage. But when I looked at what I genuinely believed was best for my daughter, and surely that is what a parent should do, school just didn't seem right for her just now. </p> <p>Why not? It all began when we first met a friend of ours who was home schooled. My partner, in particular, who had never thrived at school, was amazed to find out that it was not compulsory. We began to ask questions and dig deeper into the world of home-schooling, and despite initially thinking the idea was totally crazy, it began to feel like a viable option. </p> <p>Not only that, but the more questions we asked, the more we read, the more people \u2013 mainly teachers \u2013 we spoke to, the more it began to seem like school could actually be a damaging place to be. </p> <p>Not because of disruptive children or bullying teachers \u2013 although, of course, that could be a problem \u2013 but because of the actual teaching. Schools, particularly today with the huge amount of testing involved, seem to see their job as coaxing and cajoling children into learning set things at set times through a combination of gold stars and naughty corners. </p> <p>It seemed a shame to place a four-year-old, so full of eagerness to explore and understand the world, into such a restricting environment where she would only learn things because she had to or because there was a reward at the end.</p> <p>The theory behind autonomous learning, on the other hand, which is one of the ways home-schooling is often done, is that if you learn things when you have a genuine desire to, you will understand them better, you will have fun, and, more importantly, you will retain a love of learning. </p> <p>Of course, this approach can provoke lots of worrying questions. Left to their own devices, won't children simply want to watch TV all day? Won't they become over-indulged brats? How will they learn about the Battle of Hastings or quadratic equations all by themselves? </p> <p>It requires a lot of trust, and that can be difficult. But the evidence is there that it works, most recently in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2008/aug/19/schools.education\">a book</a> by academics at the University of London, which concluded that informal learning at home was an \"astonishingly efficient way to learn\".</p> <p>Just this week, something else momentous happened in my daughter's life that convinced me that little bit further. She learnt to swim. </p> <p>As she calmly doggy-paddled a width for the first time, another father came up to me in the pool and asked me where she'd had her lessons. He was amazed when I said she had never had any. That until a few weeks ago, she had never even been in a pool without armbands. </p> <p>Despite constantly thinking that perhaps I should, I had never attempted to teach her, but had always just let her play in the water as she wanted. Then suddenly she decided, for herself, that she wanted to swim. And within a couple of days, she could. </p> <p>Of course, despite all the government targets, the cajoling, the curriculum and the strict timetables, school is not just about learning. It is about being with other children, in an environment away from your parents. </p> <p>This is my biggest concern about home education. I have heard countless times that home-schooled children are at least as socially well adjusted as schoolchildren. However, with most of my daughter's friends heading off to school, I do wonder who she is going to play with on a daily basis.</p> <p>The answer will lie, I hope, with the other home-schooled children in the area. The problem is finding them and arranging regular sessions together. I know there are lots of internet forums linking home educating families, so it's time to get logged on and find out what they're up to.</p> <p>And if it doesn't work out, and she does just want to watch TV all day, or throw stones at passing cars, well, there is always school. I didn't start until I was five and a half anyway. That was normal in the 1970s.</p>",
  "<p>The sheer joy was mightier than even the achievement of wrecking Croatia's proud unbeaten record of 35 qualifying matches at home. With Theo Walcott's first goals for his country packaged as a hat-trick, this was the most uncanny result for England since the 5-1 trouncing of Germany in 2001. In his first fixture of genuine significance, Fabio Capello has awakened immense expectations. Perhaps he is also the man to meet them.</p> <p>Croatia were left short-staffed by a red card for Robert Kovac in the 51st minute, when England were only one ahead, but his offence was born of an inability to cope with these piratical visitors. His elbow to the head of Joe Cole left the Chelsea midfielder so bloodied and dazed that he had to be replaced by Jermaine Jenas. The damage done to Croatia in their World Cup campaign will take far longer to heal.</p> <p>They enjoyed nothing more than an irrelevant goal from Mario Mandzukic and even that was not permitted to go unpunished. Within four minutes Wayne Rooney was sending Walcott through to roll home his third goal and complete the scoring. The 19-year-old had become the contemporary version of Michael Owen on that occasion in Munich, ending the seven-year vigil for a hat-trick by an England player in a competitive match.</p> <p>How foolish it now seems that there was questioning of Capello's decision that Owen, in semi-fit condition for Newcastle United, would not be required in Zagreb. Who supposed that Rooney would find the net again for his country after 11 months of frustration?</p> <p>Capello will hear only praise, but he is unlikely to dwell on it. England, after all, did not proceed from Munich to lift the World Cup. With this outcome he has simply done the maximum possible so far.</p> <p>His legend was not in particular need of burnishing but Walcott's goals make the Italian look a magus of a manager for England, although it is the skills of players that are truly decisive. There were confident showings in all areas of the team last night, with the centre-backs Rio Ferdinand and John Terry, for instance, authoritative under pressure.</p> <p>It is goals that hold the richest promise of fulfilment. Walcott put England in front although the opportunity had its random element, with Danijel Pranjic clearing a Rooney pass and smacking the ball into the back of his team-mate Robert Kovac. Possession dropped to Walcott and from a tight angle on the right the Arsenal player found the far corner. Soon he was learning that prominence has its unpleasant consequences as, seven minutes from half-time, Josip Simunic inflicted a professional foul for which he was booked.</p> <p>The atmosphere at the Maksimir usually galvanises Croatia but that, of course, was an incentive to Capello. With this triumph his methods are beyond criticism, and his new team have already taken a long stride towards the 2010 World Cup.</p> <p>In addition, victory was England's settling of accounts with the sorrowful past. A 3-2 win for Croatia at Wembley 10 months ago barred them from Euro 2008. Failure breeds instability and of Capello's starting line-up here only Gareth Barry, Frank Lampard and Joe Cole had kicked off that night in November 2007.</p> <p>Last night's plan entailed the overriding of Capello's natural conservatism, with Walcott continuing in place of David Beckham. Any reservations about the youngster's ability to cover had been superseded by the conviction that his speed would unsettle Croatia, although the former captain did come on for a cameo and his 105th cap when the game had been won.</p> <p>England, inevitably in a trying environment, were not uniformly efficient. Ashley Cole, for instance, was unsteady at the start and set-pieces spread panic. After 13 minutes David James palmed a corner towards Vedran Corluka but his drive missed the target. With half an hour gone the goalkeeper flapped a free-kick to Mladen Petric only for the forward's effort to rebound from Wes Brown.</p> <p>Croatia's difficulties were far more severe. Simunic was inexcusably spared a second yellow card after body-checking Rooney, but the leniency of the referee Michel Lubos turned out to have its limits. There was no option but to send off Kovac for the elbow to the head of Cole</p> <p>Slaven Bilic's side were outplayed and out of control. The second goal for Walcott, drilled with vast confidence from an angle on the right, was set up by Rooney after neat interplay with Emile Heskey, who guided the United man back to a more exuberant and influential level.</p> <p>England, avoiding leniency against short-staffed opposition, struck again four minutes later. A Jenas cut-back was converted by Rooney. Croatia, so often imperious here, were left with nothing more to do than strive for damage limitation. It was an extraordinary achievement by England. Afterwards, Capello was in a mood to consign it to the archives, but this rout ought to be a memory which will invigorate the squad.</p>",
  "<p>Jamie Carragher has vehemently denounced Liverpool's \"ruthless\" owners, Tom Hicks and George Gillett, but believes Rafael Ben\u00edtez must share responsibility for the public spat that almost cost the Spaniard his job last year.</p> <p>The Liverpool defender admitted he feels physically ill at the prospect of Hicks and Gillett making a substantial profit on their investment in the club, having so far failed to deliver the new stadium that was promised on the first day of their take-over 20 months ago. That project has been delayed for at least a year by the \"global economic climate\". </p> <p>Writing in Carra: My Autobiography, which is published today, Carragher claims: \"For richer or poorer, we'd sold Liverpool to two ruthless businessmen who saw us as a moneymaking opportunity. They didn't buy Liverpool as an act of charity; they weren't intent on throwing away all the millions they'd earned over 50 years ... They wanted to buy us because the planned stadium offered a chance to generate tons of cash and increase the value of the club.\"</p> <p>Loading much of their debt on to the club to the tune of \u00a330m in annual interest repayments, despite initial promises to the contrary, triggered the start of their breakdown with the Liverpool support, the 30-year-old added. \"Breaking this vow set the first alarm bells ringing, the embarrassing continual changing of the stadium plans was irritating too,\" he wrote.</p> <p>Ben\u00edtez does not escape criticism in Carragher's tome with the Spaniard accused of triggering last season's disharmony by calling for greater and more urgent investment in his squad. \"I understood why the owners were unhappy with him too,\" he added. \"They'd been undermined by Rafa and now they were undermining him.\"</p> <p><strong>Manchester City</strong>'s new signing, Robinho, has admitted being responsible for leaving graffiti inside Chile's national stadium on Sunday. The forward was aggrieved by what he perceived as a \"lack of respect\" from Brazil's opponents in a World Cup qualifier in Santiago. Brazil won the game 3-0 and afterwards Robinho scrawled on the dressing-room wall: \"There must be respect for the best team in the world.\"</p> <p>\"I was the one who wrote it,\" he admitted. \"I wrote it because I think Chile should have shown some respect to the best team in the world. Chile did not respect us and look what happened to them.\"</p>",
  "<p>Chelsea intend to contest a Football Association charge that they failed to keep their groundsman under control, leading to his infamous spat with Manchester United's Patrice Evra on April 26, when the Frenchman was warming down with his team-mates after they had lost a game 2-1.</p> <p>The governing body had initially laid charges against Sam Bethell but those were thrown out at a preliminary hearing into his conduct on Monday, when Chelsea said they had not told him he was subject to FA regulations and they had not mentioned it in his contract.</p> <p>Chelsea now consequently have until September 25 to respond to their charges, but they issued a statement on their website yesterday. \"We are surprised and extremely disappointed that the decision to charge the club has been taken nearly five months after the incident. The charges will be contested as we understand that no racist language was used and that Sam Bethell was doing no more than trying to defend himself. Chelsea FC is deeply committed to stamping out racist behaviour and would never condone it.\"</p> <p>The confrontation between Bethell and Evra took place well after the final whistle and led to unedifying scenes in which the Frenchman, Paul Scholes, Park Ji-sung and Carlos Tevez clashed with stewards and members of Bethell's staff. The groundsmen had asked the United players to move off an area they were trying to mow, but the players alleged that Bethell had aimed a racist insult at Evra, something Bethell denies.</p> <p>The ruling body's statement read: \"The FA has charged Chelsea FC for breaches of FA rules in relation to the conduct of their groundsman Sam Bethell and the nature of their employment contract with him. Firstly, the club has been charged with a breach of FA rule E20(a) for failing to ensure that Bethell conducted himself in an orderly fashion and/or refrained from any one or a combination of racist and/or abusive and/or provocative conduct and/or language ... Chelsea have consequently been charged for their failure to include the required provisions in his employment contract.\"</p> <p>Evra was charged with improper conduct and requested a personal hearing which has been scheduled for October 2.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> London. <br> <strong>The lineup:</strong> Ben Seymour (synths) and Melanie Gilligan (vocals).<br> <strong>The background:</strong> Petit Mal may be an electro-pop duo comprising one boy and one girl, but The Ting Tings they are not. Their debut single isn't called \"Oi! DJ Shut Up and Let Me Dance\" or anything like that. No, it's called Crisis In the Credit System and, notwithstanding Stereolab's socio-political messages and Marxist critiques, it's the first pop song about the credit crunch, even though it was actually written two years ago. Which makes them not just brainier than The Ting Tings, but more prescient, too.</p> <p>They must be brainy because one of them, Ben Seymour, is the Deputy Editor of online publication, Mute, who recently wrote something about regeneration and gentrification in London, made a film on the subject and worked on a series of photo-essays on the restructuring of the capital's East End while creating a research database for \"antagonists of contemporary urbanism\". Meanwhile, his partner Melanie Gilligan, hardly a dunce herself, is a sometime filmmaker who penned an article, Slumsploitation - The Favela on Film and TV, on \"the cinema of slums\" (eg City Of God), that explored the difficult subject of \"whether representation is the answer to 'social exclusion' or one of the mechanisms of its reproduction\". Blimey. As synthpop duos go, Petit Mal make the Pet Shop Boys look a bit, well, thick. One of their songs is called Mt Dimension and features a line about \"Escher-like cross-characterisation\". Petit Mal have been labelled \"Chris &amp; Cosey meet Malaria, with lyrics by Robbe-Grillet\". And not for nothing. Robbe-Grillet was a French writer (he died in February) whose style was described as \"phenomenological\". Enough said.</p> <p>And yet, and yet ... You can dance to them. Just. \"Petit mal\" is used to mean seizure, the sort that occurs during epilepsy, but you don't have to jerk manically like Ian Curtis while their music is playing. They've got that arty/accessible duality down pat, the sort that early '80s synth-duos used to have, so that before you even realise it, you're humming and moving along to ideas that are quite high-falutin' and complex. While the electronic melodies are easy on the ear, the lyrics are likely to be about how \"grief is a curious state\" or somesuch. Crisis In the Credit System might be sung with Teutonic dispassion by Gilligan, and it might be about \"the mysteries of the global financial system ... based on a prophecy of financial apocalypse\", but it's accompanied by a lovely melancholy tune and a finger-clicking electronic beat. Yes, the single will be featured in a four-part fictional film of the same name that Gilligan has scripted and directed (to be released online on September 29), one that makes connections between Northern Rock and Das Kapital, but that doesn't make it any less enjoyable, even if a working knowledge of capitalist imperatives and socio-economic structures is recommended.</p> <p><strong>The buzz:</strong> \"The most interesting and forward looking artists on the avant-electronic underground pop scene!\"<br> <strong>The truth:</strong> Erudite disco can have mass appeal \u2013 remember, the Pet Shop Boys used to reference Che Guevara and Debussy on their hits... <br> <strong>Most likely to:</strong> Seize the means of production. <br> <strong>Least likely to:</strong> Induce seizures \u2013 this music really is just standard, infectious electro-pop.<br> <strong>What to buy:</strong> Crisis In The Credit System is released by Difficult Fun on October 13. <br> <strong>File next to:</strong> Pet Shop Boys, Tears For Fears, OMD, Yazoo. <br> <strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/petitmalpetitmal\">MySpace.com/petitmalpetitmal</a></p> <p><strong>Tomorrow's new band:</strong> Plastic Little.</p>",
  "<p>So farewell then <strong>ITV</strong>. The UK's largest commercial broadcaster has lost its place among the top 100 British companies and been relegated to the FTSE 250 index.</p> <p>It's a slap in the face for executive chairman Michael Grade - whose share package incidentally does not start paying out until the shares hit 135p - and bad news for <strong>BSkyB</strong>, which bought its 17.9% stake at the same level <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2006/nov/18/bskyb.television1\">over a year ago</a>.</p> <p>The question being asked now is whether it will ever get back in or whether it will succumb to a takeover within the next few months. The shares were the day's biggest riser in the FTSE 100 - too late to prevent relegation - as traders played a game of hunt the bidder, closing up 3p at 48.8p.</p> <p>That speculation has been heightened by talk that the decision on the future of Sky's stake is imminent.</p> <p>The Competition Commission <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2007/dec/21/bskyb.television1\">ruled late last year </a>that the broadcaster must sell the controversial stake down to under 7.5%, a proposal with which John Hutton, secretary of state for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/jan/29/bskyb.itv\">agreed</a>.</p> <p>Sky <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/feb/22/bskyb.itv\">appealed</a> that decision to the Competition Appeal Tribunal which held its main hearing back in June. While waiting for the judgment, Sky has been approached by a number of companies interested in snapping up the stake as a prelude to a bid.</p> <p>German media behemoth Bertelsmann, whose RTL venture owns Five, has been mooted as interested, as have Haim Saban, the media entrepreneur behind Mighty Morphing Power Rangers, American hedge fund Silver Point Capital and venture capital firm Apax.</p> <p>Most recently, executives from Mediaset, the Italian media empire controlled by the country's prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, have made it plain that they are interested. Even the appearance of Walt Disney boss Bob Iger in London on Wednesday set tongues wagging.</p> <p>But far more interesting for media industry conspiracy theorists are recent moves by former ITV boss Charles Allen.</p> <p>He was at the helm when a consortium headed by Greg Dyke made an <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2006/apr/01/itv.television\">unsuccessful swoop</a> on the company in 2006. That consortium included Goldman Sachs which is where Allen recently appeared as a senior adviser.</p> <p>Allen is also <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/sep/10/virginmedia.mediabusiness\">joining the board</a> of Virgin Media as a non-executive director and it was Virgin's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2006/nov/21/citynews.television\">original attempt</a> to merge with ITV that was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2006/nov/22/bskyb.television\">scuppered by Sky's stake-building</a>.</p> <p>But Allen is also a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/sep/08/charlesallen.independentproductioncompanies\">non-executive director</a> of Big Brother producer Endemol which itself has expressed interest in buying up ITV's production business. Endemol, of course, was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2007/may/14/independentproductioncompanies.citynews\">bought last year</a> by a group of investors which included Goldman Sachs and Mediaset.</p> <p>Away from the media goldfish bowl, <strong>Carphone Warehouse</strong>, which closed down 7.2p at 192.3p, is also being relegated from the FTSE 100 as is pubs group <strong>Enterprise Inns</strong>, which closed down 30.7p at 234.25p - the day's biggest blue chip loser - after Morgan Stanley dropped its recommendation to underweight from equal weight. The last of the four companies relegated is mining group <strong>Ferrexpo</strong>, down 7.1p at 165p, index compilers FTSE confirmed after the market closed.</p> <p>In their place will come satellite operator <strong>Inmarsat</strong> - up 7p at 536p - <strong>Stagecoach</strong> - down 1p at 312.25p - silver producer and the first Mexican company to float on London's main market <strong>Fresnillo</strong> - down 13.5p at 339p - and software group <strong>Autonomy</strong> - down 8p at 1042p. </p> <p>The index they will be joining on September 22 closed down 49.4 points at 5366.2 points as banking and mining stocks dipped lower, the former because of continuing worries about the state of the global financial sector in the wake of Lehman Brothers' woes, and latter because of expectations of slowing demand as recession bites in developed countries. </p> <p>In fact, on Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up about 90 points when London closed due to relief that Lehman Brothers was not in worse shape. But this side of the Atlantic, <strong>Barclays</strong> lost 19.2p to 346.5p with <strong>HSBC</strong> down 3.75p at 902.5p.</p> <p>Among the mining stocks, <strong>BHP Billiton</strong> dropped 20p to 1385p with Xstrata down 133p at 2225p. <strong>Lonmin</strong> dropped 9p to 3066p after South African mining group Aquarius Platinum denied it is looking to launch a counter bid for the group. Reports had suggested that Aquarius was looking to trump Xstrata's 3300p offer with its own deal involving fellow South African firm Mvelaphanda.</p> <p>Worries about the economy abound after the European commission, in its <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/sep/10/recession.creditcrunch\">half year economic assessment</a>, forecast that the UK, Germany and Spain will go into recession this year, echoing the prediction of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.</p> <p>Some retailers are obviously already feeling the pinch.

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/lehmanbrothers\">Lehman Brothers</a> today attempted to rebuild shattered confidence in the bank, rushing out its third quarter results and outlining a series of measures to raise cash and sharply reduce its exposure to the ailing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/subprimecrisis\">property market</a>.</p> <p>The bank said it had lost $3.9bn (\u00a32.21bn) in the third quarter, chiefly owing to a further $5.6bn of write downs related to its commercial and residential property investments.</p> <p>In a hastily convened conference call, Lehman chief executive Richard Fuld said the bank would continue to examine other strategic options, which analysts said was akin to putting a \"for sale\" sign above the business.</p> <p>Fuld described the current crisis as \"an extraordinary time for our industry and one of the toughest in the firm's history,\" but said the bank would pull through. \"We have been through adversity before and always come out a lot stronger.\"</p> <p>Lehman had been scheduled to publish its third quarter figures next week but was forced to bring the announcement forward as fears the bank could be the next victim of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/creditcrunch\">credit crunch</a> sent its shares 45% lower on Tuesday.</p> <p>The bank intends to spin most of its commercial property assets, around $30bn, into a separate company and is selling off $4bn of its UK residential mortgage portfolio to the private equity firm Blackrock.</p> <p>The bank is also slashing its year end dividend from 68 cents to just 5 cents, a move that will save $450m. Lehman said it has reduced its global headcount by around 1,500 workers over the past quarter.</p> <p>The embattled investment bank is also in advanced talks to sell off a 55% stake in its lucrative investment management division, which includes the asset manager Neuberger Berman. Analysts reckon the division is worth about $10bn.</p> <p>The moves Fuld said had \"quickly derisked and resized\" the firm. \"We will have what we believe to be a strong and clean balance sheet that will allow us to focus on our core client businesses.\"</p> <p>The market has been on high alert since the near collapse of Bear Stearns in March and fears for the future of Lehman Brothers had wiped almost 300 points off the Dow Jones industrial average on Tuesday.</p> <p>Wall Street suffered further volatility early in the day and was trading 74 points higher at midday. Lehman shares were up 22 cents at $7.99, although credit default swaps, the instruments that provide a type of insurance on its debt, widened, suggesting that concerns remain.</p> <p>The latest focus for anxiety was Washington Mutual \u2014 its shares were down more than 25% after being downgraded by the credit rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's.</p> <p>The sharp fall in Lehman shares on Tuesday had been sparked by a report that talks had broken down with a potential investor, the Korea Development Bank, and that its options for raising much-needed capital were running out.</p> <p>KDB, which is owned by the South Korean government, today confirmed that it had pulled out of talks. In a statement, it said the decision had been due to \"disagreements over transaction terms and in consideration of the state of financial markets at home and abroad\".</p> <p>Lehman has had failed talks with at least two other firms.</p> <p>The bank said it had already been reducing its exposure to property but felt the need to accelerate its efforts to extract itself from the market.</p> <p>Including the Blackrock deal, it has now reduced its exposure to residential property by 47%. It said it expects the sale to Blackrock to be completed within weeks.</p> <p>It intends to spin-off its commercial real estate division, to be called Real Estate Investments Global, in the first quarter of next year.</p> <p>The gross write-downs included $5.3bn on residential mortgages and $1.7bn on commercial real estate positions \u2014 offset partly by hedging.</p> <p>The loss was the Lehman's largest since going public in 1994 and followed losses of $2.8bn in the second quarter.</p> <p>Cubillas Ding, senior analyst with Celent, a Boston-based research firm, said; \"Lehman Brothers' latest results continue to open up what's inside Pandora's box and it's not pretty. The risks that the firm had taken on within the real estate markets and related investments seems highly concentrated.\"</p> <p>He said the bank had been forced to make \"hard decisions\" now that the \"various options on the table had narrowed and balance sheet concerns start to bite\".</p> <p>Asked if he would consider a buyer for the entire bank, Fuld responded: \"I have always said that if anybody came up with an attractive proposition that made it compelling for shareholder value, it would be brought to the board and evaluated and that has not changed.\"</p>",
  "<p>This year will see the second-biggest loss on record of Arctic sea ice - a sign that the area of ice coverage is shrinking at a pace faster than once expected.</p> <p>The trend also suggests that global warming is likely to increase, polar bear habitat will decline, and previously icebound areas could be opened to oil and gas exploration.</p> <p>Mark Serreze, a senior scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Centre, said yesterday that the sea-ice minimum, which will be reached later this month, won't hit last year's record because the amount of daylight is decreasing in the Arctic and a new freeze is beginning.</p> <p>But the minimum amount of ice at summer's end this year will be near last year's total. In 2007, the extent of Arctic ice was 23% lower than the previous record in 2005. </p> <p>That 2007 total, which set a record, was 1.65m square miles. As of Monday, satellite observations showed 1.78m square miles.</p> <p>Arctic sea ice is important because it reflects most sunlight, keeping polar regions cool and producing a cooling effect at lower latitudes. Open water, in contrast, absorbs the sun's energy, and the warm ocean waters mean more ice melting, the National Snow and Ice Data Centre says.</p> <p>If ice is lost, more sun is absorbed, and heat from the ocean is released back to the atmosphere, Serreze said.<br>The understanding of the impacts of these changes is still in its infancy, Serreze said.</p> <p>The centre's measurements show the ice has declined dramatically during the past 30 years.</p> <p>\"The real issue is, what's the long-term trend - and it's negative,\" Serreze said. He said summer could be ice-free in the Arctic by 2030. Some scientists give it just another decade.</p> <p>Two years of extreme ice minimums indicate that the low in 2007 wasn't random, said James Overland, a scientist who researches the Arctic climate at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).</p> <p>The cause of the ice loss is a combination of global warming from an increase of greenhouse gases and natural variations - winds that brought warm temperatures and blew ice to the Atlantic side, Overland said. If the cause was global warming alone, most scientists thought they wouldn't see this kind of ice loss for 30 years, he said.</p> <p>This summer conditions were more normal in the Arctic, but the ice was thinner to begin with.</p> <p>\"The question was, would the new ice last through the summer - and it did not,\" Overland said.</p> <p>The relationship between ice and ocean conditions will make it hard for sea ice to return to what it was before, he said. Instead, the long-term trend will be decline in ice cover.</p> <p>Two years ago, scientists didn't foresee major sea ice loss until 2050, but because of a combination of factors, \"we're on a fast track\", Overland said.</p> <p>Ignatius G Rigor, a scientist who researches Arctic sea ice and the atmosphere at the Polar Ice Centre at the University of Washington, said he still thinks there's a chance this year's minimum will hit a new low.</p> <p>Rigor said greenhouse gases from fossil fuels are changing the climate, bringing warmer temperatures and changes in weather patterns over the long term.</p> <p>Arctic sea ice is far below the average in the 1980s and before, and has been declining since about the 1970s, Rigor said. The ice retreat coincides with increasing temperatures around the globe.</p> <p>Like Overland, Rigor said the changes in Arctic sea ice are from a combination of global warming and natural changes - winds, high pressure and higher temperatures. The bottom line, he said, is that temperatures are important, but variations in wind are also part of the equation.</p> <p>Overland was one of the government scientists who determined that the polar bear should be listed as an endangered species because global warming would reduce sea ice by 2050.</p> <p>In the past two years, polar bears north of Alaska and Siberia have had \"a very difficult time\", and that will continue for the foreseeable future, he said.</p> <p>Sea ice habitat will decline to 20% of what it was 20 years ago, Overland said. When that will happen isn't known, but 2030 is a reasonable projection, he added.</p> <p>Overland also said that declining ice also speeds up the prospects of oil exploration in northern Alaska, Canada and Siberia.</p>",
  "<p>Dr Rajendra Pachauri, the chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, gave a <a href=\"http://www.ciwf.org.uk/news/factory_farming/lecture_calls_for_dietary_change.aspx\">lecture</a> on Monday night in London in which he pointed out that by halving their meat consumption, people in western countries would do more to reduce their CO2 emissions than if they halved their car usage. Since our addiction to personal transport is hard to break, he suggested people who cared about their children's future might want to gradually move to a few meat-free days.</p> <p>I was on the discussion panel that followed the lecture. He did not preach, this was more of a \"<a href=\"http://www.nudges.org/\">nudge</a>\", that notion that has become fashionable with new <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2008/08/07/do0701.xml\">Cameroonians</a>.</p> <p>Except it seems even a nudge is too much. The thing I am enjoying about Boris Johnson being mayor of London (there has to be some consolation) is that he is so good at revealing true Tory colours. David Cameron may come over all strong on climate change, but nudge us towards less meat \u2026 you cannot be serious! Johnson's <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2008/09/09/do0901.xml\">Daily Telegraph</a> column yesterday said. (How does he manage to fit it in with his onerous duties running the capital?)</p> <p>Johnson is going to have a series of epic barbecues and called them Pachauri days in satirical homage, because what we actually need, he reckons, is global population control.</p> <blockquote> <p>It's not eating meat that does the damage. It's the huge and remorselessly growing number of people who want to eat it.</p> </blockquote> <p>This is the classic Conservative line: it's not us and our consumption or economic activity that's the problem, it's someone else's fault, in this case, again as usual with Conservatives, foreigners who will insist on having too many children.</p> <p>Since he accuses Guardian columnists of not being prepared to mention the difficult issue of population control, here's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jan/29/politics.greenpolitics\">George Monbiot</a> on the subject:</p> <blockquote> <p>Even if there were no environmental pressures caused by population growth, we should still support the measures required to tackle it: universal sex education, universal access to contraceptives, better schooling and opportunities for poor women. Stabilising or even reducing the human population would ameliorate almost all environmental impacts. But to argue that population growth is largely responsible for the ecological crisis is to blame the poor for the excesses of the rich.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Tories though don't do collective action or global social justice. </p> <p>Fortunately, in the audience on Monday night was Johnson's very own new food tsar, Rosie Boycott, who agrees, she told me, that everyone in the west needs to cut down their meat consumption \"because it is completely unsustainable\". </p> <p>We need both collective action and measures to stabilise population to tackle the enormity of the threat from climate change. We also need to tackle the extraordinary concentration of power in the food system that drives our patterns of consumption. </p> <p>One other member of Monday night's discussion panel was the lead author of the enormously influential FAO report <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/ag/magazine/0612sp1.htm\">Livestock's Long Shadow</a>, Dr Henning Steinfeld. Much of Pachauri's argument was based on the work of this report. It pointed out that livestock accounts for roughly one fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions, more than all of transport. How had it been greeted by governments? Well, Steinfeld admitted, the response seems to have been to freeze his department's budget. Much of the funding for the work came from the Danish government \u2013 but since Denmark just happens to be one of the largest producers of industrial pig meat in the world the findings were presumably a little awkward. </p> <p>Will old lefties be any better at tackling vested interests? London food tsar Boycott was astounded to learn just how much CO2 emission there is from a single kilo of beef (the equivalent to driving a car 250km in fact).

He says to his friends: \"Well that's what I heard anyway.\"</p> <p>Diageo's new ad will be edited for the Irish market. The African version closes with shots of Guinness in bottles, but draft beer is the preferred drinking method in Europe.</p> <p>Matthew Barwell, Diageo's marketing and innovation director for Africa, said the growing importance of the market had led to the development of ad campaigns with international potential.</p> <p>\"This is the first time an African ad campaign has been picked up in western Europe. The world is changing fast; as we continue to grow there will be more work shared between global markets,\" Barwell added.</p> <p>\"The TV ad is about the elemental nature of Guinness. It is about the mystery and magic of the product. The ad plays on the real African tradition of storytelling in a fun way.\"</p> <p>Last year Nigeria passed Ireland to become the second largest market for Guinness, after the UK, with Africa accounting for a third of the volume of the stout sold each year and 55% of the growth in financial terms.</p> <p><em><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediaguardian.co.uk\">editor@mediaguardian.co.uk</a> or phone 020 7239 9857.

  "<p>As <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/davehillblog/2008/sep/09/boris1\">trailed</a>, Boris Johnson fourth Mayor's Question Time \u2013 \"MQT\" to we hipsters \u2013 commenced with a statement about his reorganisation of the mayoral organisation \u2013 or disorganisation, as it has mostly been since he came to power. Flop fringed and genial like an old <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dulux#Dulux_dog\">Dulux ad</a>, he proposed to \"realign\" policy development into two areas, one called \"Development and Environment\" the other called \"Communities and Intelligence\". The second part of the latter seems a strange and vaguely sinister choice. Johnson failed to explain what sort of \"intelligence\" it refers to. If nothing else, it looks a hostage to fortune. </p> <p>Of course, all this realigning is in part a way of imposing spending cuts including, the mayor admitted, in (more) GLA jobs. Quite how sharp these cuts will be, though, is in dispute. Lib Dem AM <a href=\"http://www.london.gov.uk/assembly/members/tuffreym.jsp\">Mike Tuffrey</a> referred to a copy of today's Daily Mail which, inexplicably, appears to have inside knowledge about a \"<a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1054072/London-mayor-Boris-Johnson-wields-15-cent-spending-axe-template-Tory-rule.html\">huge cost-cutting drive</a>\" planned by the mayor offering David Cameron a \"possible blueprint for a future Tory government.\" </p> <p>The mayor himself was at pains to play this down, even suggesting in a carelessly jovial way that the assertions of the Daily Mail are not necessarily reliable. It then emerged that, in this respect, Johnson may be in limited agreement with his already traditional MQT goad, Labour's <a href=\"http://www.london.gov.uk/assembly/members/biggsj.jsp\">John Biggs</a>. The talk from the top has been of savings of15%, but Biggs reckoned that once the smoke and mirrors were removed, the true figure was more like a fifth of that. </p> <p>Due to an unfortunate malfunction in my abacus I can't tell you who is correct. But I can confidently report that all three of the knowledgeable people I invited to interpret the proposals while at City Hall this morning were in total and unequivocal disagreement about what they really mean. I hope that's helpful. If not, let's move swiftly on to the wider context in which the restructuring \u2013 whose deeper detail is being elaborated in <a href=\"http://www.london.gov.uk/assembly/bmac/2008/sep10/agenda.jsp\">committee</a> by it chief architect Sir Simon Milton as I type \u2013 is occurring. </p> <p>Debates continue about what sort of Tory Mayor Johnson really is. Should we regard him as the spawn of Thatcher or of Macmillan? Is he fully in tune with the Cameronian overture to voters or, now that the assorted <a href=\"http://wwp.greenwichmeantime.com/time-zone/europe/uk/england/london/south-west/london-sw1/victoria-street/conservative-party/\">Central Office</a> Elvises have left the building, is he starting to compose his own, distinctive melody? Now that we are at last seeing some semblance of orchestration in his regime let's hope that we will soon begin hearing the true Boris loud and clear.</p>",
  "<p>Ken Livingstone was warmly welcomed to our <a href=\"http://www.greenparty.org.uk/conference.html\">conference</a> last night, and convinced even waverers that he is absolutely serious about climate change. We see him as the only high profile UK politician outside of Green party who has actually delivered real improvements to our environment and who has taken risks to promote green innovations.</p> <p>However, this warm welcome does not extend to his party and that is the real message that Livingstone must take away with him if he wants to be <a href=\"http://www.thelondondailynews.com/work-chavez-p-1203.html\">re-elected</a> as London mayor in 2012. He was elected as the independent-minded, political outsider in 2000 and he lost as the establishment figure, standing alongside Gordon Brown, in 2008. As he gathers the resources to launch a London thinktank and to mobilise an alliance of progressive-minded people, the Greens are expected to form part of the rainbow coalition which will lift him back into power. As much as I loved working with him, I think that independent-minded Greens will naturally want to explore the full range of options before signing up to any Livingstone gameplan for the 2012 elections. <br> First, it is worth remembering what Livingstone has going for him. He not only had a lot of the right targets and policies for creating a sustainable London, he was also starting to green the way that money was spent by the Metropolitan Police, Transport for London and the London Development Agency. Ken walked the green walk, whilst myself and Darren Johnson held his wallet in an arm lock. The four years of budget agreements between the London mayor and the Green group meant that we led the country on traffic reduction and all kinds of <a href=\"http://london.greenparty.org.uk/achievements08\">cutting-edge policies</a>.</p> <p>Livingstone has spent the whole of his political life pursuing the rainbow coalition. When leader of the Greater London Council he supported gay rights, women's rights and all the battles of people from ethnic minorities. He was brave, well ahead of his time and regularly slammed by the national media for saying things which have since become accepted as the new common sense of our metropolitan lives.</p> <p>One of the minor innovations was the setting up of the <a href=\"http://www.gle.co.uk/history.htm\">Greater London Enterprise Board</a> with a strong emphasis on promoting green technologies. He was anti-nuclear power, pro-cycling and keen on animal rights (especially goldfish, circus animals and newts). The environmental movement was still emerging as a political force, but Livingstone made a small bit of space for it as part of this coalition politics.</p> <p>However, when Red Ken was replaced by New Ken in 2000, he wanted the greens to take their place alongside business and the property developers in his big tent. We had four years of mixed messages with the traffic generating Thames Gateway Bridge sitting alongside the traffic reducing congestion charge. For example, it was only after we got the budget agreement in 2004 that the mayor started telling his friends in the property development industry that renewable energy was a must have. We also have reservations, with others on the left, about mixing in a big tent with religious bigots who have unpleasant views on homosexuals and women. So despite our good working relationship with the previous mayor, we never wavered from criticising him when he mucked up. We were never really in Livingstone's big tent, just pitched on the same campsite.<br> The Labour party obviously has to sort out whether Ken is its \"future\" in 2012, but he is smart enough to know that the Greens won't trust the rest of his party to walk the green walk. The second-preference voting system for the mayoral elections does make Green party endorsement a bit more crucial than in other elections. Whilst we have a very good relationship with the Labour assembly members, as part of a progressive opposition to Boris Johnson, they are unfortunately handicapped by supporting a government with the worst environmental record I can remember. Building roads, nuclear power stations and developments on green fields are bad enough, but these are just the most obvious downsides of a government which never got the environment and never will. There is no environmental initiative by this government which they haven't either been pushed into (normally by the EU), or run to catch up with public opinion. There is no leadership, only complacency. From air quality, to recycling and climate change, we see only slow, reluctant steps. Even Miliband is really no better, as one of his few decisions as environment minister was to approve the incineration of waste, instead of recycling it. Livingstone is not completely immune to the sins of new Labour. Whilst he fought the disastrous <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/2617703.stm\">privatisation of the tube</a>, he did award the contract for the East London Line extension to a private company. As mayor, he consistently refused to criticise the police and his attitude to civil liberties was very new Labour (ie, awful). Livingstone may have been a tough negotiator for London, but part of his approach was to bend his principles and act in a way friendly to whoever was bringing big investment into London. This often worked, but was it always the right sort of investment? For example, Livingstone annoyed many local communities by getting rather too cozy with property developers and the corporate chain stores. <br> The Greens were never naive about Livingstone and the political games he played, but we are elected to change the world and we knew a good deal when we saw it. Our preference is always to elect a Green party mayor, but if others get elected to the post and want to work with us, then we will need a lot of convincing \u2013 as Johnson is finding out. I do believe that there is a progressive majority in London and that a London mayor, of whatever party, needs to respect that. Livingstone's bid to mobilise and lead the opposition to Johnson has to be taken seriously, but none of us should think that he's going to automatically abandon the struggle to claim that progressive majority and just fall back on his suburban doughnut. With the prospect of eight years of Conservative government the political landscape is rearranging itself and Livingstone may not fit with how Londoners see their future. Young challengers could emerge from within the Labour party or the Greens. The debate about London's future is now open.</p>",
  "<p>Six Greenpeace climate change activists have been cleared of causing criminal damage at a coal-fired power station in a verdict that is expected to embarrass the government and strengthen the anti-coal movement. </p> <p>The jury of nine men and three women at Maidstone crown court cleared the six, five of whom had scaled a 200m tall chimney at Kingsnorth power station at Hoo, Kent in October 2007.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337487235\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/pictures/2008/09/10/GordonChimney.jpg\" alt=\"Kingsnorth chimney\" width=\"220\" height=\"330\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Greenpeace activists on the painted chimney. Photograph: Will Rose/Greenpeace</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The activists admitted trying to shut down the station by occupying the smokestack and painting the world \"Gordon\" down the chimney, but argued that they were legally justified because they were trying to prevent climate change causing greater damage to property around the world.</p> <p>It was the first case where preventing property damage caused by climate change has been used as part of a \"lawful excuse\" defence in court. It is now expected to be used widely by environment groups. </p> <p>The court had heard from Prof James Hansen, one of the world's leading climate scientists, that the 20,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emitted daily by Kingsnorth could be responsible for the extinction of up to 400 species. </p> <p>Hansen, a Nasa director who advises Al Gore, told the court that humanity was in \"grave peril\". </p> <p>He said: \"Somebody needs to step forward and say there has to be a moratorium, draw a line in the sand and say no more coal-fired power stations.\"</p> <p>It also heard David Cameron's environment adviser, millionaire environmentalist Zac Goldsmith, and an Inuit leader from Greenland say that climate change was already seriously affecting life around the world.</p> <p>The court was told was that some of the property in immediate need of protection included parts of Kent at risk from rising sea levels, the Pacific island state of Tuvalu and areas of Greenland. </p> <p>The defendants also cited the Arctic ice sheet, China's Yellow river region, the Larsen B ice shelf in Antarctica, coastal areas of Bangladesh and the city of New Orleans.</p> <p>Goldsmith told the court: \"By building a coal-power plant in this country, it makes it very much harder in exerting pressure on countries like China and India to reduce their burgeoning use of the fossil fuel.\"</p> <p>The jury was told that Kingsnorth emits the same amount of CO2 as the 30 least polluting countries in the world combined \u2013 and that there are advanced plans to build a new coal-fired power station next to the existing site on the Hoo Peninsula in Kent.</p> <p>Greenpeace used the court's decision to pile pressure on government to abandon plans for a new generation of coal-fired plants. </p> <p>\"Today's acquittal is a potent challenge to the government's plans for new coal-fired stations from jurors representing ordinary people in Britain who, after hearing the evidence, supported the right to take direct action in order to protect the climate,\" said Ben Stewart, Greenpeace's communications director who was one of the six acquitted. </p> <p>The others were Will Rose, Kevin Drake, Tim Hewke, Huw Williams and Emily Hall.</p> <p>\"It wasn't only us in the dock, it was coal-fired power generation as well. The only people left in Britain who think new coal is a good idea are business secretary John Hutton and the energy minister Malcolm Wicks,\" said Hall. </p> <p>\"It's time the prime minister stepped in and embraced a clean energy future for Britain.\"</p>",
  "<p>I know the last thing we need right now is another North American election to worry about. Just as the coverage of the US election reaches saturation point in Europe, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper has <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/7602864.stm\">announced</a> that Canada will go to the polls on October 14, in an attempt by Harper to increase the ruling conservative party's position to a majority government. And we should be worried.</p> <p>The US election obviously matters to Europeans - the last eight years have shown us how much of a stake the rest of us have in who America chooses as its next leader on November 4. What we might forget, in the next two months of North American election campaigning, is how much the Canadian election matters too.</p> <p>The lack of interest abroad in Canada's national politics is striking - probably partly a perennial stereotype of Canada as peaceful (read: boring) country, partly because the last eight years have required a heightened focus on the big bag of crazy that the institutional politics of Canada's southern neighbour has become. No one has benefited from this more than <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/harper_stephen/\">Harper</a>: outside of Canada, there's barely been a mention of the fact that even calling this election is a violation of his earlier electoral promise to set fixed election dates, to stop politicians calling elections whenever they're in a favourable position in the polls (can you guess why Harper called the election now?).</p> <p>In Britain we seem to be inured to how bizarre and undemocratic it is for leaders to be able to pick an election date. Harper's outright flip-flopping on the issue makes the whole problem transparent - and, sure enough, the likely outcome of the October election will be a majority Conservative government in Canada.</p> <p>The broken pledge on fixed elections is just the latest dubious act from Harper, a man who has dismissed the Kyoto Protocol as a <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2007/01/30/harper-kyoto.html\">\"socialist\" enterprise</a> with no purpose other than to punish rich nations, acquiesced to George Bush's war on terror, culled funding for <a href=\"http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20061004/tories_women_061004/20061004?hub=Politics\">women's advocacy programmes</a> and accepted same-sex marriages only after members of his own party <a href=\"http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20061207/samesexmarriage_vote_061207/20061207?hub=TopStories\">voted against him</a> on a motion to \"restore the traditional definition of marriage\". For a prime minister with a powerless minority government, he's managed to do an almost impressive amount of damage since coming to power two years ago, damage that - particularly on environmental issues - has an impact far beyond Canada.</p> <p>Some have argued that, even if you don't like Harper, a majority government of any kind is better than the current gridlock. Others have argued that it doesn't matter - that, being \"right or left wing in Canadian politics has come to mean as little as being left- or right-handed for a tennis serve\", that the main parties <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/article.jsp?content=20060206_121010_121010\">compete for the centre</a>. But this ignores how odious Harper could be when no longer reined in by his enfeebled parliamentary position.</p> <p>If you care about the American election because you're scared of Sarah Palin's scepticism toward global warming, you should worry about Harper's unwillingness to continue his predecessor's work against climate change. If you hated George Bush because of his government's corrosion of civil liberties at home and abroad, the fact that Harper has been a thorough Bush apologist is a worrying indicator of how a full-fledged Conservative government would encroach on the rights of Canadians.</p> <p>Although Harper's agenda in the event of a majority government is still unclear, his record is a worrying indicator of the way things will go: to the list of anti-gay rights, anti-women and anti-environmental positions, we can add legislative changes giving Canada's immigration department unprecedented powers to reject immigration applications, as well as setting back truly universal childcare plans in favour of <a href=\"http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060502/budget_childcare_060502?s_name=&amp;no_ads=\">childcare \"allowances\"</a>. His foreign policy record is more of a question mark, but during the minority government Harper extended the pledge of Canada's troops in Afghanistan from 2009 to 2011. If John McCain is elected after Harper wins a majority, and decides another Middle Eastern country is looking at him the wrong way, is there enough in Harper's record to reassure us that he wouldn't bring Canada into an American-led invasion?</p> <p>So, with so much potentially at stake, why are we so uninterested in Canada's politics? Admittedly, even if Canada elected Conrad Black himself it would never be able to drag Britain into an illegal war - but is the fact that America has such an obvious impact on our lives the only reason we cover American politics so extensively in Europe? Is that really the reason the media here covers hurricanes only when they effect the US? The reason people watch The Wire? Surely Britons would at least claim we care about American politics because we also care about the lives of ordinary Americans, in and of themselves, and Barack Obama's and John McCain's domestic policies are reported extensively here. We're more concerned, obviously, with whether the next US president will invade another country than improve the domestic literacy rate, but we care about the US literacy rate too.<br> But even Canada's foreign policy, never mind its literacy rate, is largely ignored by the European media. Even before and beyond Harper, Canada's role in the war on terror has barely been scrutinised abroad - perhaps in part because its politics inconveniently ruptures neat periodisation. While 2001-2007 meant, for us, George Bush and Tony Blair, Canadians have gone through three prime ministers in this time.</p> <p>But it's perhaps due more to the way the rest of us buy wholesale into Canada's carefully crafted self-identity as the good-guys. After 9/11, Canada's good-guy image and the perceived rightness of the Afghanistan war were implicitly mutually reinforcing. Canada is a famously peaceful nation so, the implied reasoning went, the war in Afghanistan must be just because the mission was led by the nation of progressive liberals (even after 2006, when Canada elected Harper, they did this mainly because the Liberal party was eating itself while the Bloc Quebecois split the opposition votes. Canada's heart is still, generally, liberal). It often feels that Canada isn't treated as a nation so much as a totem, a moral barometer for western liberals elsewhere. Another mutually reinforcing binary: the not-Americans; the good-guys.</p> <p>This lazy equation was ruptured in the early 2000s, while progressives were too busy blaming America for all the world's evils to notice the complicity of the good-guys to the north. The incarceration and torture of Canadian citizen <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.ca/human_rights_issues/maher_arar_overview.php\">Maher Arar</a> at the hands of US authorities, and the Guant\u00e1namo detention of the Canadian minor <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/khadr/omar-khadr.html\">Omar Khadr</a>, were met with silence by the Liberals in Ottawa - the supposed good-guys in a nation of good-guys.</p> <p>The point here is not to paint Canada's response to the new realities of the 2000s as on par with Britain's or America's actions in these years. Of course there's an element truth at the heart of the crafted myth of Canada's liberal identity. I wouldn't have moved there for a year if there weren't. And of course it can feel difficult, as a British person opposed to the Iraq war, to criticise a country that had the strength not to be dragged into it.</p> <p>But, with all respect for that, perhaps it's time to recognise how the assumption that Canada is a problem-free good-guy nation is not only patronising to those who live there with far from problem-free lives \u2013 but also leaves, until we begin to unpick this assumption, a missing piece in our understanding of how the last seven years were allowed to happen.<br> If Obama wins the election less than a month after the Canadian election, the almost-unthinkable will happen: for the first time in generations, Canada will have a government that is more conservative than its southern neighbour. And perhaps that's what will restore America's reputation in Europe more than all the promises of hope and change: the day <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6666338/\">Canadian tourists put American flags</a> on their backpacks so that you'll treat them nicely.</p>",
  "<p><br> A model of Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan at the studios of Madam Tussauds in Acton in 2007. Photo: Graeme Robertson</p> <p>Prepare for a lot of celebratory bhangra: Twentieth Century Fox has just <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/sep/10/bollywood.newscorporation\">announced</a> it is to open a studio in Mumbai. The new venture with STAR, an Indian satellite network which, like Fox, is part of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp empire, is setting out to break into the enormous commercial Hindi-language film market, better known as Bollywood. </p> <p>It doesn't stop there. India has 23 official languages, and almost as many film industries. Kollywood (based in Kodambakkam, Chennai) puts out about 100 movies a year in Tamil. Tollywood (based in Andhra Pradesh) makes films in Telugu. There is further significant production in Bengali, Assamese, Kannada, Malayalam and other languages. And the new Fox STAR Studios has its beady eye on all of them. So, is Hollywood taking over Bollywood? Or is it the other way around?<br></p> <p>Almost one sixth of the world's population lives in India, and they really like going to the cinema. Bollywood's bewildering combination of non-stop action, syrupy romance, untranslatable comedy, brutal violence, formation dancing and obligatory wet sari scenes gets four billion bums on seats every year. Globally, more people watch Bollywood films than Hollywood films, and perhaps that's not surprising. Compared with blockbusters like Om Shanti Om or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/aug/27/singhiskinng.bollywood\">Singh is Kinng</a>, most Hollywood movies are short, po-faced, and sadly lacking in singing and dancing. </p> <p>A report valued the Indian film industry at $1.8bn in 2006, and it is predicted to grow to an astonishing $5bn by 2011. Shahrukh Khan, its biggest star \u2013 and therefore, arguably, the biggest star in the world \u2013 claims to have just turned down a five-picture deal worth $125 million. </p> <p>With all this cash flying around, and stories of India's new wealth making the pages of the New York Times on a daily basis, it's not hard to see why American studios might be looking east. Bollywood films are relatively cheap to make, even if they do feature Shahrukh, and the returns can be very high. </p> <p>Despite this, global film industry integration has yet to be visible. This year, the most notable Western stars appearing in Bollywood movies are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/jun/23/news.culture1\">Sylvester Stallone</a> and Snoop Dogg, both past their prime at home. There are still no Asians or Asian-Americans on the Hollywood A-list. Attempts at actual crossover films \u2013 2004's Bride and Prejudice relocating Jane Austen to the Punjab, or 2007's Saawariya trying to sell Moulin Rouge back to the West with even more glitter sprinkled over it \u2013 have left critics and audiences mostly shrugging and wandering off.</p> <p>Behind the scenes, though, integration is already well on the way to achieving its potential. Visual effects houses like Red Chillies in Mumbai are producing world-class work, and Disney has teamed up with Yash Raj Films to produce computer animated features. The first of these, Roadside Romeo, will see Bollywood A-lister Saif Ali Khan lend his voice to a spoilt puppy this October. Anyone who saw him in Salaam Namaste will know that the role isn't much of a stretch.

  "<p>\"Mexico has several national problems \u2026 one is social injustice, another is insecurity and the third is the lack of forwards,\" novelist and football author <a href=\"http://letrasdelmundo.tamaulipas.gob.mx/participantes/images/juan-villoro.jpg\">Juan Villoro</a> pronounced earlier this year <a href=\"http://www.elportaldemexico.com/arte/literatura/08juanvilloroentrevista.htm\">in an interview</a>. \"The Mexican public generally has little faith in results, we are less concerned about the denouement on the pitch because if we were very concerned we wouldn't be able to be such football fans. Especially at international level which is when Mexico is hardly ever a protagonist; more like never.\"</p> <p>Asked whether he thought there was any hope for the Mexican national team, Villoro said: \"That's one of Mexico's great challenges [\u2026] It's so hard to find good forwards in Mexico, ones that score goals. I think it's a structural problem in the league, it has to do with players being sold too fast, with tournaments which are too short for any long-term development strategy to work, too much TV influence, too much business interference \u2026 in short, I think it's a long-term problem which will not be resolved by a shaman, or a magician appointed to manage the national team.\"</p> <p>Several months on from the foretelling of the shaman's appointment, enter Don Sven-Goran Eriksson. Not exactly a magician, his arrival nevertheless has connotations of the ethereal world evoked by Castaneda in his epic writings about the adventures of Don Juan. The Mexican press has come up with the moniker 'Don Sven' when, amid high expectations regarding preparations for the World Cup qualifiers this week - Mexico beat Jamaica 3-0 at the Azteca last Saturday and face Canada tonight - quotes from Jamie Carragher's book were swiftly lifted round the globe. The <a href=\"http://www.impre.com/laraza/deportes/futbol-mexicano/2008/9/4/marcador--antilde;oran-a-sven--78846-1.html\">Don Sven's seduction lessons sorely missed</a> is a case in point.</p> <p>Eriksson may well be surprised to the extent to which his reputation pursues him. Perhaps he took the Mexico post wishing for quiet weekends in Yucatan <a href=\"http://www.cnnexpansion.com/actualidad/2008/05/12/sven-goran-eriksson-al-tri\">on a large salary</a>. Far from the madding European press, Mexico's appeal includes Caribbean beauty in an affluent setting: Mexico can be described as a rich country in as much as both life expectancy and income per capita <a href=\"http://graphs.gapminder.org/world/#$majorMode=chart$is;shi=t;ly=2003;lb=f;il=t;fs=11;al=30;stl=t;st=t;nsl=t;se=t$wst;tts=C$ts;sp=6;ti=2006$zpv;v=1$inc_x;mmid=XCOORDS;iid=phAwcNAVuyj1jiMAkmq1iMg;by=ind$inc_y;mmid=YCOORDS;iid=phAwcNAVuyj2tPLxKvvnNPA;by=ind$inc_s;uniValue=8.21;iid=phAwcNAVuyj0XOoBL_n5tAQ;by=ind$inc_c;uniValue=255;gid=CATID0;by=grp$map_x;scale=log;dataMin=199;dataMax=42642$map_y;scale=lin;dataMin=25;dataMax=84$map_s;sma=49;smi=2.65$cd;bd=0$inds=i143_t002006\">have been growing steadily since 1950</a>.</p> <p>Not only that, but Mexico's football industry ranks something like fourth in the world in terms of income and revenue. It enjoys a huge market and passionate supporters, and even <a href=\"http://forums.interbasket.net/showthread.php?p=188383\">the domestic league</a> is surpassed only by Brazil outside Europe. Like every other football association on the planet, the Mexican one is <a href=\"http://mexidata.info/id1058.html\">the target of criticism</a> and accusations of mismanagement. But the issue that needs addressing the most is perhaps why this firm position among the world's best in terms of wealth and revenue doesn't translate into results.</p> <p>Mexico has an international presence on the world stage. It reaches the World Cup finals. But, more often than not, the experience for Mexican fans is as described by Villoro in his book, <a href=\"http://www.leedor.com/products/ver_2_1795_%20Dios%20es%20Redondo.html\">God is Round</a>, \"dreaming a match soaked in glory only to awaken a few minutes from the final to face a shrapnel reality\".</p> <p>\"In order to understand the last few years of the Mexican national side one has to take into account [Ricardo] La Volpe's long process \u2013 the authoritarian Argentinian, unpopular, who achieves an acceptable play system based on tyranny but who never wins a title or achieves anything exceptional,\" Villoro tells me. \"With some solid arguments and quite a lot of spite, Hugo Sanchez criticised him harshly. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NSWhQ3INiw&amp;feature=related\">The best Mexican player of all time</a>, he got his turn managing the national side. The expectation was either absolute glory (something hard to achieve) or the possibility of lynching him (something more to hand). The latter was the case.</p> <p>\"Sven's arrival is like that of ET \u2013 he doesn't know Mexican football, he doesn't speak the language, he will be paid a lot more than Hugo and his prestige as club manager has never been reflected on a national side. His big mistake was to make his debut in an official match, a World Cup qualifier against Honduras, and he won by a lean 2-1 in spite of playing at home. Following La Volpe's tail he chose players who have become nationalised in an 'express' way but are not good enough to forgive the fact they take the place of a Mexican player. His lack of experience here led him to line up some young talent, [Carlos] Vela and Giovanni [dos Santos], who were world champions with the Under-17 side, but who don't have enough experience to carry the weight of such a big game (between them they barely have five goals in the first division).</p> <p>\"I foresee Sven's role will be very similar to Hugo's (mediocre and predictable), but I think he will manage the issue with more diplomacy. Curiously, he doesn't arrive promising great things, or hoping to give free reign to illusions, the way one might expect of a manager of his hierarchy, or the way [C\u00e9sar Luis] Menotti did. Rather, he comes to contribute common sense to a crazy environment, made all the crazier by commercial and political pressures.\"</p> <p>At the last Copa Am\u00e9rica, Mexico finished in third place, with Brazil and Argentina in front. This is more than 'dignified', as Villoro would say. But nevertheless, and in spite of some fans holding optimistic hopes that Sven will bring the necessary international and professional clout to the equation, Villoro remains sceptical. The 3-0 win against Jamaica he dismisses somewhat: \"It's relative - the rival was extremely weak. We played at home. It wasn't a great performance. Quite the contrary, I think one should criticise some of the mistakes and the weaker points. Mexico has always had a superior achievement to its Caribbean rivals.\"</p> <p>Sven-Goran Eriksson begins a new phase of his career in the new world. Many think he's taken the appointment like a diplomat might take on a well-paid stay in a far-away embassy. But in the world of the Quetzalcoatl, following the Byronian trail of Don Juan, it will be interesting to see how he will fare - will he measure up to the shaman's wisdom? On a Mexican literary website I found <a href=\"http://mexfiles.wordpress.com/category/sports/futbol/\">an image of Tezacatlapoca</a> with the caption: \"'Lord Smoking Mirror' is the god of the world we know, master of reality and unreality. Only Mexico would conceive of the master of the real world as a trickster.\"</p> <p>Perhaps Sven is the man for the job after all.</p>",
  "<p>There's a new whiff of privatisation in the air. Two of mainland Europe's biggest state-owned utilities, La Poste in France and Deutsche Bahn in Germany, have signalled they are planning for an injection of private capital as they gear up for liberalisation of EU markets in the post and on the railways.</p> <p>The postal market is due to be fully competitive from 2011 while the rail market will pre-date it by two years. But the two behemoths are already planning their transformation, with DB's Hartmut Mehdorn, its chief executive, saying its float of 24.9% of its transport, logistics and services arm will take place in late October. This could raise \u20ac5bn in one of Europe's biggest most recent IPOs.</p> <p>The more extraordinary of the two operations is that of La Poste. Throughout the tortuous negotiations among EU institutions over postal liberalisation, originally slated for 2009, the French operator was among the fiercest critics of full-scale competition - unlike the British, Germans and Swedes. But Jean-Paul Bailly, its chairman, has had a Damascene conversion.</p> <p>He now wants to raise up to \u20ac3bn to help finance La Poste's European expansion and to get the legal process in place so that the public enterprise, changed into a SA (PLC), can open up its capital as early as 2011. Rather than attract pension funds, Bailly apparently wants to raise capital via the stockmarket. The state, probably in the form of its investment arm, the CDC, could play a restricted role and the 400,000 current and retired employees would be reserved their share. But the target is institutional and retail investors.</p> <p>La Poste turns over more than \u20ac20bn a year and, in the first half of this year, delivered \u20ac481m in net profits. But it lacks the capital to fund its expansion, notably into Spain, or its full modernisation. It also has \u20ac5.9bn in debt. Its model is, clearly, Deutsche Post which is now 69% in private hands and delivering double-digit earnings growth despite continued losses from its DHL business in the US. The German group, still trying to offload its Postbank, says it is on course to make around \u20ac4bn operating profit this year.</p> <p>It won't be plain sailing for La Poste, however. The unions, which held talks with government ministers on the issue this week, have called a national \"day of action\" for September 23 in protest. Full privatisation is also banned by the French constitution which stipulates it should remain in public hands. But its current plans certainly reveal it more geared up for pan-European liberalisation than poor Royal Mail.</p> <p>The British group, in its submission to the independent (Hooper) review of the postal market, complains repeatedly of its limited equity capital as its struggles to deal with losses in its declining universal, six-day letters service and what it claims is a \u00a32.6bn cash gap caused by price controls. Its regulator, Postcomm, openly favours the injection of private capital and private sector partnerships to enable a \"more rapid transformation\" and make it more efficient and profitable.</p> <p>But it's far from clear how this would be achieved and experts believe that private capital will only be available if Royal Mail is broken up, with profitable parts of its business like Parcelforce sold off. Meanwhile, the Greeks and Estonians are thinking of privatising their postal operator. The Danes and Swedes are getting together, with the Danish state, postal employees and private equity group CVC owning 40% and the Swedish state and employees of Posten owning the other 60% of the combined operation.</p> <p>Unless the Hooper report comes up with some radical proposals and this or the next government is ready to bite the bullet, the Brits, the privatisation pioneers, are in danger of being left behind in the EU - again.</p> <p><strong>Unsung hero gets its chance to shine</strong></p> <p>Belatedly, Britain is trying to catch up in one sector of the economy that has been belittled in the past while other European countries, above all Germany, nurtured it: manufacturing. Richard Lambert, CBI director general, extolled this week about a pending \"renaissance\". Gordon Brown shipped his cabinet to Birmingham where it set out a \"new strategy\" for the sector.</p> <p>Gordon's choice of location reminded me, inevitably, of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2005/apr/20/politics.motoring2\">Rover and its self-inflicted demise at the hands of the Phoenix Four earlier this decade</a>. It's an uncomfortable memory, partly because the Guardian (and this correspondent) played its part in Rover's ignominious downfall by investigating and chronicling its dubious financial base.</p> <p>When Rover went into administration in April 2005, I wrote <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2005/apr/09/davidgow\">a comment piece on the role of manufacturing in the modern UK economy</a> and, a wee confession, all too readily saw it as doomed to decline as the international division of labour shifted low-cost industrial output to emerging economies such as China and the services sector grew. The piece paid lip service to the notion of a balanced economy, citing France, Germany and Italy as exemplars, but fell too glibly into the alluring services trap.</p> <p>But the year-long financial sector crisis has made us all devotees of \"rebalancing\" the economy, giving a greater emphasis to manufacturing. The sector accounts for just under 15% of UK GDP (more if you include manufacturing-related services) compared with 22% in the EU and the cabinet's stated intention for this \"unsung hero\" is to help it grow.</p> <p>The medium-term financial support, at \u00a3150m, is puny but there's a fresh, much-needed emphasis on encouraging young people to study/train for and enter a sector that has lost 2m jobs in the poast quarter of a century. We're hardly likely to get to the stage where \"engineer\" carries the same professional clout and social cache as it does, say, in Germany or Italy but it's a start.</p> <p>One caveat is the very belated stress put by John Hutton, business secretary, on \"green technologies\" such as nuclear (sic) and renewables - both areas in which the French and Germans, among others, have already secured a lead. If the government is genuinely serious about, say, renewable energy, it should stop blocking progress within the EU on the new directive and promote its growth at home - rather than devising schemes to make backing for overseas projects count towards meeting its share of Europe's ambitious target.</p>",
  "<p>The organisers of the Tour de France have welcomed Lance Armstrong's plans to return to the event next season, but have warned the seven-time champion that he will need to adhere to stricter drug-testing regulations in 2009. Armstrong, who retired from professional cycling after winning seven consecutive Tour de France titles between 1999 and 2005, has decided to attempt to become the oldest winner of the event at the age of 37 in order to \"raise awareness of the global cancer burden\".</p> <p>However, the Tour de France director Christian Prudhomme underlined on Tuesday that should Armstrong return to the event he would have to undergo the same stringent drug-testing procedures as any other cyclist. \"He must follow all the rules today, that are much more strict than they were before,\" said Prudhomme. \"If Lance Armstrong is at the start of the Tour de France, it will be the same thing for him and for his team, of course. I can't say anything else. There won't be any exceptions.\"</p> <p>After recovering from testicular cancer, Armstrong became an inspiration for cancer sufferers the world over, as he became a dominant force in cycling at the end of the 1990s and the first half of the current decade. However, his career was never far from controversy. </p> <p>Armstrong enjoyed a close working relationship with Michele Ferrari, the Italian doctor who was convicted, and subsequently acquitted on appeal, of malpractice, although the charges did not involve Armstrong, while in 1999 traces of a cortisone-based substance were found in a urine sample provided by the American but he was cleared on the grounds that the drug had been used to treat a skin complaint.</p> <p>In 2005 an investigation by the French newspaper l'Equipe revealed that the banned blood booster erythropoietin had been found in urine samples provided by the American during his first Tour win in 1999 but no sanctions were taken because an inquiry commissioned by the International Cycling Union ruled that the testing had been carried out on an unofficial basis, for research purposes.</p> <p>\"Suspicion has followed Lance Armstrong since 1999, everyone knows that,\" said Prudhomme. This year, blood tests were carried out on all riders just days before the start in Brest. \"All the Tour riders, and Lance Armstrong if that is the case, will have to submit to rules that were harder than they were before, because it is necessary.\"</p> <p>The sport has been dogged by doping scandals over recent times. Floyd Landis - a former team-mate of Armstrong's - was stripped of his 2006 Tour title after testing positive for testosterone. The following year Alexandre Vinokourov was caught using a banned blood transfusion and race leader Michael Rasmussen was expelled before the finish for allegedly lying about his whereabouts when he missed pre-Tour anti-doping checks. This year, Riccardo Ricco of Italy was kicked out for using EPO after winning two stages.</p> <p>Armstrong's return could see him join the Astana team, which is run by his friend and former sporting director Johan Bruyneel, who helped the American win all his seven Tours. Bruyneel suggested on Wednesday that he would find it almost impossible not to include a fit-again Armstrong in his team. \"My relationship with him goes beyond the professional rider-director relationship,\" said Bruyneel. </p> <p>\"I don't see myself running a team and having to race against him. I don't want to run too fast, but I can say that I cannot imagine him being on another team. We are obviously going to have to speak a lot in the next few days.\" However, Astana are not untainted by controversy themselves, having been barred from this year's Tour after a series of doping scandals at the 2006 and 2007 Tours. With Astana's inclusion in next year's competition contingent upon the Tour's organisers approving their return Armstrong may have to look elsewhere for new employers.</p> <p>For his part Armstrong claims that returning to the Tour will go a long way to ending suspicions that have shrouded his multiple Tour wins. \"Many of the guys that got second through 10th, a lot of them are gone,\" he said. \"Out. Caught. Positive tests. Suspended. Whatever. And so I can understand why people look at that and go, 'Well, [they] were caught - and you weren't?' So there is a nice element here where I can come with really a completely comprehensive program and there will be no way to cheat.\"</p>",
  "<p>Food and water shortages caused by global warming could lead to military conflict among the Asia-Pacific's emerging superpowers such as China and India, the Australian prime minister, Kevin Rudd, warned today.</p> <p>Australia needed to strengthen its armed forces in response to an \"explosion\" in defence spending in Asia, he said. There was a growing arms race in the Asia-Pacific, and economic and political conflicts could lead to military confrontation, he said.</p> <p>\"Militarily ... as it has already become economically and politically, the Asia-Pacific will become a much more contested region,\" Rudd said.</p> <p>Among the emerging challenges to Australia's security were the \"increased militarisation\" of the region and \"preparing for the new challenges of energy security and anticipating the impact of climate change on long-term food and water security,\" he said. \"Population, food, water and energy resource pressures will be great.\"</p> <p>While the Asia-Pacific would increasingly be linked economically, the Australian prime minister said, longstanding disputes - such as those between North and South Korea and between China and Taiwan - were likely to remain potential flashpoints for conflict.</p> <p>Rudd announced that Australia's defence budget would increase by 3% annually for a decade, and said strengthening the navy was the country's military priority.</p> <p>\"There is an arms build-up across the Asia-Pacific region and Australia therefore must look at the long-term future at the same time as advancing our diplomacy,\" he said.</p> <p>Neil James, the executive director of independent thinktank the Australian Defence Association, said that due to inflation the spending increase would not be enough to maintain Australia's current military capability, let alone expand it.</p> <p>\"Australia underspent on defence for about three decades, so the current increases are really a catch-up,\" said James.</p> <p>Rudd said Australia would strengthen security cooperation with Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore, while maintaing its defence alliance with the United States as the bedrock of its security policy.</p>",
  "<p>In the last 20 years, the City of London has achieved a remarkable level of political backing that comes close to canonisation. </p> <p>Despite a central role in the current deep-seated <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7521250.stm\">economic crisis</a>, the prevailing political and economic view remains in awe of Britain's financial institutions. </p> <p>The financial services industry has certainly become an increasingly important engine of the economy. While the contribution of manufacturing has been falling, financial services have been growing its share of economic output from 6.6% in 1996 to over 10% in 2007. Over the last three years financial services have accounted for a remarkable one-third of overall GDP growth. London now sits as the leading global financial centre, outstripping New York in a range of financial services. </p> <p>But is it not time that the government started to take a more sceptical view of the City's contribution? </p> <p>Top City salaries greatly exceed those of FTSE 100 chief executives, part of the explanation for the leap-frogging spiral of business pay. The average pay in the City of London is more than double the UK average. While financial intermediaries account for some 5% of full time male employees, they swallow up 40% of the national bonus pool. Even the governor of the Bank of England has recently spoken out on the way City salaries distort the economy by skewing the pattern of rewards for talent.</p> <p>The City argues that this disparity reflects their greater contribution to economic performance. An alternative explanation is that despite fierce competition for business, some parts of the City operate as a giant, informal cartel charging what most independent observers believe to be excessive fees \u2013 \"the croupier's take\" \u2013 for activity that often involves the transfer ( or sometimes the destruction) of wealth \u2013 towards themselves and their clients \u2013 rather than its creation. Rarely do the initial financial gains involved trickle down to anyone else \u2013 shareholders, staff or customers.</p> <p>Take the fees charged for merger advice. In 2007, <a href=\"http://www.ml.com/index.asp?id=7695_15125_17454\">Merrill Lynch</a> pocketed the lion's share of the estimated $400m fees paid out by the consortium led by Royal Bank of Scotland for its successful bid for ABN Amro, a deal that turned out to be ill-advised, with the bank greatly overpaying for its rival while the investment bank has recently picked up more fees for advice on the rescue rights issue forced on the bank. </p> <p>Although individual deals are negotiated, in general, finance directors in Britain's biggest companies rarely question the overall scale of fees charged for services such as managing mergers and acquisitions and handling share issues. One insider has called the money earned by the banks \"supernatural\". </p> <p>Part of the reason is that the City's clients \u2013 who mostly handle other people's money and whose own salaries are high by the standards of other professionals \u2013 have no incentive to query the fees being charged, while the regulators feel powerless to intervene. In turn, the cosy relationship between the executives of investment banks and the companies they advise arises mainly because big business has become increasingly dependent on the banks.</p> <p>Apart from helping to create the current economic turbulence, there are wider problems. Once one of the City's main roles was to provide medium and long-term capital for business development. Today there has been a shift towards short-term, fast-buck making deals; investing in companies of the future is an increasingly fringe activity compared with speculating on share prices, interest rates and currency movements. </p> <p>Following his inquiry into the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street_Crash_of_1929\">Great Crash of 1929,</a> Judge Ferdinand Pecora described the investment bankers of the time as having a \"Heads I win, tails you lose ethics\". Seventy-five years on, not that much has changed. </p> <p>Although some of the City's more untoward methods have been exposed in the fall-out from the credit crunch, little has been done by the regulators to tame its wider practices and its excessive pay. Similar failures in other industries would have had the Competition Commission marching through the doors. </p> <p>Yet despite the much higher levels of pay and bonuses in financial services compared with other sectors, the industry has never been the subject of an enquiry. Now is surely the time for the commission to conduct the task it was set up to do. </p> <p><em>Stewart Lansley is the author of Do the Super-Rich Matter? a TUC Touchstone Pamphlet</em></p>",
  "<p>\"Wind power could put another half million people into fuel poverty\" \u2013 shock, horror! That was how BBC Radio 4 promoted last week's <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/theinvestigation/pip/3vlit/\">The Investigation</a> into the future of wind power in the UK. </p> <p>Who can blame them? It got me listening. But do their figures stack up? And what exactly was Sir David King, former government chief scientific advisor, up to when he uttered his dire warning? In case you missed it, here's that warning in full:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"If we overdo wind, we are going to put up the price of electricity and that will push more people into the fuel poverty trap. Numbers of half a million are not at all unrealistic ... this is an issue that does need to be revisited, and I say this as somebody who feels that we really have to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions very substantially. But in my view it is an expensive and not a clever route forward to go for 35 to 40% from wind turbines.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Shocking stuff indeed. But back to basics: where does the 35% figure come from? In 2007, EU leaders agreed that 20% of all energy used in the EU should come from renewable sources, and the UK's own national target is 15%. It's hard to get much renewable energy into heating, transport, industry and other big energy uses, so most of the target must be met from green electricity. According to the programme, this means that, by 2020, the UK will have to get 40% of its electricity from renewables generally, and 35% from wind, specifically.</p> <p>The UK currently uses about 360bn units (kW/h) of electricity per year, and this is expected to rise to about 380bn units by 2020. So, if 35% comes from wind, that is 133bn units. Over a year, wind turbines typically produce 28% of their rated capacity, so a typical 1MW turbine generates about 2.45m units per year. It would, therefore, take about 55,000 1MW wind turbines to achieve our 35%. Given we already have 2,000MW of wind power, and it costs about \u00a31m to install a 1MW turbine, we would be looking at an investment of \u00a353bn.</p> <p>The government also <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/dec/11/windpower.renewableenergy \">says it wants</a> 33,000MW of the new wind capacity to go offshore, where costs are higher, while improvements to the grid will be required to accommodate the new power sources, and interconnectors to Europe will need to be beefed up to handle supply fluctuations. Let's say all this doubles the cost to \u00a3100bn. Radio 4 quoted E.ON as estimating the cost of this scale of wind power programme at \u00a310bn per year until 2020 \u2013 so our figures roughly match up.</p> <p>But according to the programme, this would add \u00a3400 per year to the average family energy bill. This is scary, but is it true? Only if you make two completely false assumptions. First, that the entire cost is loaded onto domestic consumers, even though they only use 36% of the UK's electricity production. Second, that they pay the entire capital cost in their bills every year for 10 years. But this is not how large energy projects are financed. Just as most people buy their homes on a mortgage, which they pay off over 20 or more years, so power companies borrow the money, and pass on the cost of servicing their loans.</p> <p>Financing the whole \u00a3100bn at 6%, this would create a capital cost of \u00a36bn per year. Since domestic consumers use 36% of electricity supply, the domestic share would be \u00a32.2bn per year. Divided among 25m households, this would cost us \u00a388 per year per household. This figure does not include maintenance and running costs \u2013 but then these are small for wind turbines, since (unlike coal and gas power stations) they do not burn fuel.</p> <p>But remember that the power companies are preparing to invest billions in new fossil generation capacity, anyway. For example, E.ON is seeking approval for a new 1,600MW coal fired plant at Kingsnorth in Kent, at a cost of \u00a31bn, and similar projects are in the pipeline to replace old coal-fired plants and nuclear power stations approaching closure. With 53,000MW of new wind capacity, we won't need those investments in new coal-fired generation, and we will save money on the fuel that won't have to be burnt. Just how much will be saved depends on future fuel costs. But if fuel turns out to be expensive, wind will actually be the cheaper option.</p> <p>So The Investigation's figure that wind power will add \u00a3400 to the average's family's annual electricity bill is plain wrong. In fact, with the savings on coal, we can probably achieve 35% wind penetration in our electricity supply by 2020 for under \u00a350 per household per year, and in the high fuel cost scenario, it would add nothing at all. It will also yield security benefits by making the UK less dependent on politically sensitive Russian gas imports. And that's before even starting on the environmental cost of carbon dioxide emissions.</p> <p>As for fuel poverty, the National Housing Federation <a href=\"http://www.housing.org.uk/default.aspx?tabid=254&amp;mid=828&amp;ctl=Details&amp;ArticleID=1391\">has estimated</a> that 5,700,000 households (about 13.7 million people) will be in fuel poverty by 2010 as typical household electricity and gas bills soar to \u00a31,400 a year. So King's estimate of an extra 500,000 people in fuel poverty as a result of wind power investments barely registers against this background increase. Moreover, King provided no indication as to where his figure actually came from. Was it guesswork? Maybe he could let us know.</p> <p>In any case, we know the cause of the fuel poverty surge: more expensive fossil fuels. So the precautionary approach is to make our energy costs less sensitive to future fuel price shocks, and diversify into renewables. To generate 35% of our electricity from wind would be an important step in this direction. The bulk of our electricity would still come from fossil fuels, mostly coal and gas, but the wind component (and additional contributions from other renewable energy technologies) would represent an important counterbalance.</p> <p>There is one repect in which The Investigation got it absolutely right, which was in lambasting the UK's mechanism for delivering our renewable electricity targets, the Renewables Obligation (RO). As the Guardian <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/06/economy.energy\">revealed</a>, and I <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/06/renewableenergy.greenbusiness\">wrote about</a> last week, the RO is both ineffective and very expensive, and has received widespread criticism. As Dieter Helm, professor of energy policy at Oxford University, told Radio 4, the RO is \"probably the most expensive way of developing wind power\" and \"it would be hard to think of a worse policy.\" Yet the inside word is that the government is absolutely determined to stick with it, for essentially ideological reasons.</p> <p>This would be a serious mistake, with two undesirable consequences. First, whatever target is set within the RO, it is certain to be undershot. Second, it will create billions of pounds of extra cost for consumers above and beyond the actual cost of building and operating the plants themselves \u2013 part of which will be excess profit for wind power operators, and part of which will go as a \"windfall tax\" to the government itself. The RO should be scrapped and replaced with a feed-in tariff. Wind developers also face considerable cost and risk in getting their schemes through the planning process, which is reflected in consumer prices. Again, reform is badly needed. If King's doomladen prediction comes true, it will not be because of the price of wind, but rather thanks to the RO and the planning system \u2013 both of them manifestly unfit for purpose.</p> <p>So what was King up to? Here's my guess. He is a known supporter of nuclear power, and is widely credited for having overturned the anti-nuclear conclusion of the 2002 energy review, and for the government's current pro-nuclear stance first promulgated in its 2006 Energy Review. Perhaps his real problem with bringing 35% wind into our electricity supply is that it leaves little space for new nuclear power \u2013 that much wind would more than close the anticipated energy gap caused by the impending closure of our 23 nuclear stations over coming decades: their total contribution is just 80bn units a year, compared to the 133bn units we would be getting from wind.</p> <p>But for anyone worried about cost to both electricity consumers and taxpayers, nuclear power is the truly scary option. The cost of decommissioning our existing nuclear power stations <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/jul/23/nuclearpower.energy\">has already escalated</a> to \u00a383bn and seems certain to keep on climbing towards \u00a3100bn \u2013 roughly the cost of our whole wind power programme. If King's concern really is for the Britain's fuel-poor households, he must abandon his nuclear dream, and look instead to a clean, green future for the UK's electricity.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on Friday 19 December 2008. The calculation of the potential cost to consumers of a large-scale wind power programme referred to the average family enegy bill, not electricity bill. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>Lehman Brothers has rushed its trading statement forward by a week to today, amid growing fears that the investment bank will fail to raise much-needed capital to shore up its finances.</p> <p>Having seen <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/10/stockmarkets.lehmanbrothers\">its shares fall by 45% last night</a>, plunging Wall Street back into a state of high anxiety, the company was hit by a new blow today when the Korea Development Bank (KDB) said it had halted talks over taking a stake in Lehman.</p> <p>The breakdown of the talks with the state-owned South Korean bank is a blow to Lehman's options for raising fresh financing.</p> <p>The company will release its third-quarter results at 12.30pm BST (7.30am New York time), along with a disclosure of \"key strategic initiatives\".

The bank had hoped to secure an investor ahead of its third-quarter results.</p> <p>\"The market fears that no one will inject capital in the company,\" said Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global Research in Chicago.</p> <p>Lehman is also said to be considering the sale of its asset management division, Neuberger Berman, or its commercial real estate portfolio to raise cash.</p> <p>Shares in the bank are at their lowest in a decade and the decline accelerated toward the end of last night's trading session, with its shares closing $6.36 lower at $7.79.</p> <p>After the market closed last night, other banks, including <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/goldmansachs\">Goldman Sachs</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/citigroup\">Citigroup</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/morganstanley\">Morgan Stanley</a>, stressed that they were still trading with Lehman.</p> <p>Investors are on high alert after the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/bearstearns\">near collapse of Bear Stearns</a> in March. The credit agency Standard &amp; Poor's put Lehman on notice yesterday that it may lower its debt rating because of the \"heightened uncertainty\" about its ability to raise further capital.</p> <p>The Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission declined to comment.</p> <p>Lehman had been in discussions with KDB for the past two months but South Korean regulators told Dow Jones that the conversations had ended. The troubled US bank is understood to have held discussions with at least two other potential investors which have come to nothing.</p> <p>Lehman lost $2.8bn in the second quarter.</p> <p>The mood on Wall Street was further soured by fresh housing data, which showed home sales continuing to fall. The National Association of Realtors said pending home sales were down by 6.8% in July compared with the same month a year ago, a steeper decline than expected.</p> <p>Share price falls were reflected across the ranges of indices. The S&amp;P 500 dropped 3.4% and the Nasdaq composite was down 2.6%.</p> <p>The decision by the US government to seize control of the troubled mortgage lenders Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae had given the markets a shot in the arm on Monday, lifting the Dow Jones industrial average 289 points.</p> <p>But the future of the government-sponsored enterprises was still far from clear yesterday. Politicians in Washington began squaring up for a fight over the future of Fannie and Freddie, which were effectively taken into public ownership in the largest bailout in American history.</p> <p>The House financial services committee yesterday set a hearing date for September 24 and the Senate is expected to announce its own hearing in the coming days.</p> <p>An ideological battle appeared to be brewing over the future of the lenders with Democrats hoping to protect Fannie and Freddie's public policy role of helping low income families and widening home ownership, while Republicans mostly favoured their break-up and full privatisation.</p> <p>Treasury secretary Henry Paulson wants them to start reducing the size of their mortgage books in 2010, mirroring the situation that faced British lender <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/northernrock\">Northern Rock</a> after its nationalisation.</p>",

  "<p>After years of isolation in the wake of the Iraq war and the <a href=\"http://www.al-bab.com/arab/countries/lebanon/hariri.htm\">assassination of Rafiq Hariri</a>, the pariahs of Damascus are slowly being welcomed back into the international fold. By supporting a peace deal in Lebanon and reopening indirect talks with Israel Syria's President Bashar al-Assad secured himself an invitation to the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7505157.stm\">Bastille Day celebrations</a> in Paris earlier this year. Now Nicholas Sarkozy's visit to Damascus, the first by a western head of state since 2005, is being heralded as another major step in Syria's <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7598747.stm\">international rehabilitation</a>.</p> <p>It's worth noting that Syria's exclusion was never that substantial. Though shunned by western heads of state, Damascus didn't face the kind of economic penalties that crippled Saddam Hussein. The modest <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article1168269.ece\">sanctions</a> imposed by the US were not emulated by the European and Arab states with which Syria conducts most of its trade. Similarly, only the Americans recalled their ambassador, and even they kept their Damascus embassy open and functioning.</p> <p>Nonetheless Sarkozy's trip does represent the beginning of the end for this (albeit limited) western diplomatic boycott. What's interesting is how Syria has achieved this without making itself any more palatable to the west: remaining a dictatorship with strong ties to the feared Iran, Hamas and Hizbullah.</p> <p>To some extent there has been a shift in the west's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/27/middleeast.syria\">priorities</a>. The democracy-spreading idealism that prompted Syria's ostracism has been abandoned in the Iraqi quagmire. Instead, Sarkozy's promotion of dialogue suggests a return to stability-orientated pragmatism. However, as important in Syria's rehabilitation has been Assad's own statesmanship in carving out a regional importance for himself that has become impossible for the west to ignore.</p> <p>When Syria's international relations were at their lowest point, following the <a href=\"(http://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/apr/26/syria.lebanon\">withdrawal from Lebanon</a> in 2005, Assad did not fold under pressure. In defiance of US criticism, he continued to facilitate the Sunni insurgency in Iraq, provide arms and support for Hizbullah and Hamas, and further ties with Ahmedinejad's Iran. Calculated but intelligent, such moves ensured that Syria remained a key player in the region's geopolitics, and provided the Assad regime with at least some diplomatic leverage having just lost its prized Lebanon card.</p> <p>At the same time, Damascus cast its net out for allies. While the EU and traditional Arab friends Egypt and Saudi Arabia <a href=\"http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2008/03/200852513967755.html\">were toeing</a> the US line of exclusion, Assad found two crucial, though unlikely, friends: Turkey and Qatar. Eager to promote itself as a global player and to take advantage of its rival Saudi Arabia's absence from the scene, Qatar's increased ties with Assad has served both states well. Through the alliance Damascus has received <a href=\"http://www.fw-magazine.com/content/damascus-and-doha-surprisingly-close-siblings\">substantial investment</a> while Doha has enhanced its international reputation, most notably by brokering the recent <a href=\"http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2008/05/20086150420595250.html\">Lebanon peace agreement</a>.</p> <p>More significant has been the alliance with Turkey. A member of Nato, an ally of Israel and a country with which Syria was on the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/185916.stm\">brink of war</a> less than a decade ago, Ankara was not Assad's most obvious ally. Yet, through his quiet abandonment of claims to Turkish territory in 2005 and his unwavering support for prime minister Erdogan's <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/21/world/middleeast/21iraq.html\">operations against Kurdish rebels</a> in Iraq last winter, Assad has fostered a tight alliance. This has led to trade agreements, <a href=\"http://www.turkishpress.com/news.asp?id=208044\">open borders</a> and now, mediation with Israel.</p> <p>More recently, the same opportunism that had Assad rushing to endorse Erdogan's invasion of Iraq was seen in supporting Moscow's conflict with Georgia. While Israel condemned attempts to start a \"new Cold War\" in the Middle East, Assad's <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7574311.stm\">swift trip</a> to Russia displayed an astute reading of the political climate to secure a lifeline for Syria's antiquated defences. Far from contradicting the new peace moves with Tel Aviv, a stronger military warns Olmert's successor of the possible consequences of abandoning these negotiations.</p> <p>Assad has skilfully used these newfound friends to revive Syria's international fortunes <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1018152.html\">without cutting ties</a> with his more sinister allies. In fact, Damascus has had to concede very little to achieve this. Though applauded for the peace in Lebanon, it was the opposition who submitted to Syria's original demands: a veto for its allies in a power-sharing government and Hizbullah to keep its arms. Moreover, though praised for reviving talks with Israel, in setting out its <a href=\"http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2008/09/20089414910723513.html\">peace aims</a> recently, Damascus has made no departure from its goals since 1973: a land-for-peace agreement in the Golan Heights.</p> <p>Though major steps have been made, to truly be rehabilitated Syria needs to make serious progress with Israel and that still depends on who will succeed Bush and Olmert. Fortunately, as an unelected dictator, Bashar al-Assad can afford to wait and see. In the meantime Syria finds itself in a stronger position than it has been in years and its president is proving surprisingly skilled at foreign affairs. From the disastrous policies that led to the 2005 Lebanon crisis and withdrawal, Assad has used opportunism, calculation and grit to claw Syria back on to the international scene.</p>",
  "<p>David Cameron has marched on to traditional Labour territory by declaring that the Conservatives are now Britain's \"true champions for progressive ideals\". Tackling poverty, protecting the environment and kickstarting social mobility would be key goals in his first years in office. A Conservative government would adopt a fresh approach as central government is cut back, giving charities and voluntary groups an important role in delivering Cameron's three priorities: school reform, welfare reform and strengthening families. \"This is not going to be about the usual mechanisms of government,\" one member of the Cameron circle says. \"It is a completely new approach that the political world has not got a handle on.\" The Guardian today explains the new Tory thinking in 10 policy areas. Richard Reeves, director of Demos, then assesses whether Cameron can deliver \"progressive goals through Conservative means\". Demos is an independent thinktank which influenced Tony Blair and provided many of the policy ideas for New Labour. Recently it has been working with the Tories on seminars on the \"post-bureaucratic age\", one of Cameron's big themes. Reeves says that the Conservative march into progressive territory \"is not merely rhetorical\". Some policies score well, such as education and the environment. But he says the Tories remain \"too sceptical about the progressive potential of the state\" and are backward-looking on marriage and law and order\". And his conclusion? Overall, \"they are making progress\"</p> <h2>1. Economy</h2> <p>The Conservatives plan an evolutionary rather than revolutionary economic policy, having ruled out promises of unfunded tax cuts which have got them into so much trouble at previous elections. Given that the public finances are so deep in the red, they would have little room to cut taxes at all.</p> <p>But their long-standing promise is to \"share the proceeds of growth\" - in other words, to let public spending grow more slowly than the economy over time, thereby allowing them to cut taxes or reduce borrowing over the medium term. They have pledged to match Labour's planned 2% annual spending growth until 2011; they say there will be no \"blank cheque\" after that.</p> <p>Spending levels would be ringfenced until 2011 in health, education and international development. Spending on other departments could change, though the overall spending envelope would remain the same.</p> <p>Tax cuts would have to be fiscally neutral, at least in the first years in government. Many of these would be paid from a \"family fund\" to be financed mainly by green taxes, though they admit that opposition to these taxes is growing.</p> <p><strong>Policies</strong></p> <p>\u00b7 Abolish stamp duty for first-time buyers purchasing homes up to \u00a3250,000</p> <p>\u00b7 Increase the inheritance tax threshold to \u00a31m a person, \u00a32m a couple</p> <p>\u00b7 Impose a \u00a325,000 levy on non-doms, generating \u00a32.8bn, to pay for stamp duty and IHT cuts</p> <p><strong>Demos progressive rating</strong></p> <p>2/5</p> <p>The short-term commitment to Labour spending plans is a break with the traditional tax-cutting agenda. And hitting non-doms was a long-overdue progressive goal. But on tax there is little to cheer: abolishing stamp duty helps those in the middle and the inheritance tax cuts is a boon for those at the top</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/10/conservatives.economy\">Read more: economic policy</a></p> <h2>2. Welfare reform</h2> <p>The Conservatives are promising a \"full-bloodied version\" of what they call the government's \"half-hearted\" implementation of a radical report on welfare reform by the city financier David Freud. This calls for a greater role for the voluntary and private sector, who will be paid by results. They promise a two-pronged approach: tough new regulations from the centre coupled with a greater \"bottom-up\" approach for the voluntary and private sector.</p> <p>Tax credits, criticised by the Conservatives for masking rather than tackling the root causes of poverty, will be retained. But the Tories would aim to make them a less prominent tool in tackling poverty by improving people's skills as well, so they can secure better jobs and be less reliant on the state.</p> <p><strong>Policies</strong></p> <p>\u00b7 Tougher assessments for benefit claimants, notably the 2.6 million people claiming incapacity benefit as a result of illness or disability. All recipients of IB, excluding disabled people who cannot work, will undergo a \"work capability assessment\"</p> <p>\u00b7 People who refuse to join a return to work programme will lose the right to claim jobless benefits until they do</p> <p>\u00b7 The changes will be funded by a greater \"payment by results\" programme in which the voluntary and private sector will be paid when they succeed in returning people to work, and in keeping them there for two years</p> <p><strong>Demos progressive rating</strong></p> <p>2/5</p> <p>There is nothing progressive about leaving people in a state of long-term welfare dependency: independence is a key goal. Toughening up the conditions attached to benefits will be progressive if accompanied by measures to improve employability: bringing in non-state providers may help to achieve this so long as sufficient investment is made </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/10/conservatives.welfare\">Read more: welfare policy</a></p> <h2>3. Family</h2> <p>Family breakdown lies at the heart of Britain's \"broken society\", according to David Cameron, who will recognise marriage and civil partnerships through the tax and benefit system.</p> <p>The shadow chancellor, George Osborne, told the Guardian this week that marriage was the best environment in which to raise children.</p> <p>Cameron will also introduce measures to make Britain more \"family-friendly\". A key proposal is a health visitor for all mothers of newborn babies, to be paid from the budget for \"outreach workers\" in the Sure Start programme.</p> <p><strong>Policies</strong></p> <p>\u00b7 End the \"couple penalty\" in the benefit system which means, according to the Tories, that people are encouraged to live apart</p> <p>\u00b7 All parents to be offered 12 months' parental leave, to be shared by mother and father</p> <p>\u00b7 Universal health visiting service to all mothers of newborn babies. This will include a minimum guarantee of two visits in the home for all mothers in the later stages of pregnancy, six hours of support in the first two weeks after birth, with a series of staggered visits leading to two visits a year for all one- to five-year-olds</p> <p><strong>Demos progressive rating</strong></p> <p>3/5</p> <p>The Conservatives have set the pace on \"family friendly policies\" such as parental leave and are willing to invest in the critical early months after having children; more support for carers and fathers should be the next steps. But the tax break for marriage is a nostalgic irrelevance</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/10/conservatives.family.policy\">Read more: family policy</a></p> <h2>4. Health</h2> <p>The Tories believe that Alan Milburn, Labour's most radical health secretary, will look on with envy as they introduce what they describe as a true NHS marketplace, free at the point of delivery and funded out of central taxation.</p> <p>Milburn wanted all NHS hospitals in England to have the opportunity to become independent foundation trusts by 2008, competing with each other for patients and free to borrow to fund investment. But just over half the NHS trusts remain under Whitehall control because they cannot yet pass a fitness test showing they are ready for independence. The Tories want an independent NHS board to direct the commissioning of healthcare, deciding what level of service can be afforded within the budget set by parliament. It would not run NHS hospitals or GP surgeries.</p> <p>A Conservative government would not set \"targets\", such as reduced waiting times. But it would demand certain \"outcomes\", such as an increased survival rate from cancer, which would be published.</p> <p><strong>Policies</strong> </p> <p>\u00b7 Phasing out \"process-driven targets\", to measure \"outcomes\" instead</p> <p>\u00b7 Giving patients a choice of provider so they can use published information to decide what care they receive</p> <p>\u00b7 Introduce \"payment-by-results\" to reward hospitals and doctors that achieve high standards</p> <p>\u00b7 Rename health secretary as public health secretary</p> <p><strong>Demos progressive rating</strong></p> <p>2/5</p> <p>Giving patients more power is a highly progressive goal. More competition should drive up standards. Greater autonomy for professionals may boost productivity. But without clear targets the danger of a \"postcode lottery\" will rise. The party's support for \"local\" GPs betrays their own conservatism on the institutional structure of healthcare</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/10/conservatives.health\">Read more: health policy</a></p> <h2>5. Education/skills</h2> <p>A key ambition in public services - to pick up the \"baton of reform\" left by Tony Blair - applies strongly in education.</p> <p>Greater freedom would be granted to academies because the Conservatives believe the government has given local education authorities too great a say.</p> <p>A \"supply-side revolution\" to provide more than 220,000 new school places would have at its heart a Swedish-style system of not-for-profit \"free\" schools, run by charities, community groups and faith leaders working along the lines of academies. Working within the state sector, they would have access to equivalent levels of fund per pupil that is given to existing state schools.</p> <p>Spending would be increased on pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds, with a premium added to the \"per pupil\" funding formula.</p> <p>The Tories would change the vocational training system to make it easier for employers to give apprenticeships, which would in turn be more responsive to the demands of the job market.</p> <p>They would redirect the current \u00a31.3bn skills budget, with \u00a3775m going directly on apprenticeships.</p> <p><strong>Policies</strong></p> <p>\u00b7 New laws to improve headteachers' powers to curb poor behaviour by scrapping pupil appeal panels which assess pupils' complaints when they feel they have been unfairly excluded</p> <p>\u00b7 Ensure that every child that is capable of doing so is reading by the age of six</p> <p>\u00b7 Reform schools inspection regime to ensure \"more searching scrutiny of under-performance\"</p> <p>\u00b7 Lead a \"demand-led training revolution\" by abolishing the Learning and Skills Council and creating \"lifelong learning accounts\" to allow people to spend an allocation of money on training</p> <p><strong>Demos progressive rating</strong></p> <p>4/5</p> <p>The \"academisation\" of British education is largely to be welcomed, and the Conservatives are in the lead. Extra resources targeted at the poorest pupils, greater autonomy for school leaders, and more choice for parents: all good news. What's missing is a distinct strategy on pre-school education</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/10/conservatives.education\">Read more: education policy</a></p> <h2>6. Law and order</h2> <p>Dominic Grieve, the shadow home secretary, will adopt a tough and tender approach. As an advocate of civil liberties, Grieve would need persuading as home secretary to abandon his campaign against the pre-charge detention of terror suspects for up to 42 days. ID cards would also be abolished.</p> <p>In other areas, he would adopt a tough stance. Grieve would amend the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act so that police no longer need to secure authorisation to conduct surveillance on those suspected of non-terrorist offences.</p> <p>The Tories would accept the government's points-based system on immigration. But they would toughen it by imposing an annual limit on immigration from outside the EU.</p> <p>Prisons would provide a testbed for some of the Tories' most radical \"bottom- up\" ideas. Private companies and voluntary groups would be hired - on a \"payment by results\" basis - to steer inmates away from a life of crime in an attempt to cut re-offending rates, which account for a high proportion of crime.</p> <p><strong>Policies</strong></p> <p>\u00b7 Border police force to \"secure Britain's borders\"</p> <p>\u00b7 Directly elected police commissioners to replace police authorities</p> <p>\u00b7 Increase prison capacity by 5,000 over Labour's plans</p> <p>\u00b7 Replace automatic release for prisoners with earned release</p> <p><strong>Demos progressive rating</strong></p> <p>2/5</p> <p>Abandoning the 42 day pre-charge detention and scrapping ID cards may win over the hearts of Islington liberals: but in terms of overall policy the Tories need to focus less on policing and prisons and more on the \"causes of crime\".

Environment</h2> <p>The battle against climate change was one of Cameron's early themes when he sought to \"decontaminate\" the Conservative brand. In recent months he has faced criticism for downgrading the environment.</p> <p>Cameron sought to restore the balance in June when he said the world could not afford to abandon the environment, even in an economic downturn. A Tory government would adopt \"realistic environmentalism\" that would have four core elements: green taxes to encourage good behaviour; stringent rules to encourage greener cars; a framework to encourage greener energy; and \"nudge\" ideas, such as listing how much energy people use on their fuel bills, to encourage energy efficiency.</p> <p>Tories say they will take a major step later this year when they launch what is being dubbed as the \"first coherent UK strategy for transforming Britain into a low carbon economy\". This is expected to offer stronger support for nuclear power.</p> <p><strong>Policies</strong></p> <p>\u00b7 Average emissions for new cars down to 100 grams per km by 2030</p> <p>\u00b7 Green taxes, which would not apply retrospectively, would go into a \"family fund\" to finance tax relief for families</p> <p>\u00b7 Replace climate change levy, a tax on energy, with carbon levy to distinguish between high and low carbon production</p> <p>\u00b7 Use money from EU emissions trading scheme to fund at least three carbon capture and storage demonstration projects</p> <p>\u00b7 Ensure that carbon emissions rate generated in new power stations cannot be higher than amount generated in modern gas-fired power stations</p> <p>\u00b7 Creation of \"feed-in tariffs\" with people paid for energy produced from, for example, solar panels</p> <p><strong>Demos progressive rating</strong></p> <p>4/5</p> <p>The Conservatives have gone green, ticking boxes on micro-generation, carbon pricing, emissions standards and - maybe - the third Heathrow runway. Ring-fencing proceeds from green taxes for families is smart. But they have not paid enough attention to the impact of expensive carbon on poorer families - and look to be leaning too heavily on nuclear power</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/10/conservatives.green.politics\">Read more: environment policy</a></p> <h2>8. Transport</h2> <p>Cameron says that gridlocked roads and slow, packed trains are neither good for business nor the environment. He would launch a feasibility study to introduce an expanded high speed train network, would tackle the worst bottlenecks and look at ways of giving parents an alternative to the school run to reduce congestion.</p> <p>The City of London has been worried that Cameron has tilted too far in favour of the environment. There was alarm in June when he appeared to rule out a third runway at Heathrow on the grounds that the government should try and make the airport \"better, not bigger\".</p> <p><strong>Policies</strong></p> <p>\u00b7 Give \u00a3200m a year from the transport innovation fund to local authorities to encourage alternatives to car use</p> <p><strong>Demos progressive rating</strong></p> <p>1/5</p> <p>Good rhetoric - non-existent policies. Another feasibility study on high-speed rail? There are countless initiatives already in place to discourage the school run. In transport you have to put your money where your mouth is: and the Conservatives have failed to make a single significant commitment likely to improve our transport infrastructure</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/10/conservatives.transport\">Read more: transport policy</a></p> <h2>9. Local govt/housing</h2> <p>The Conservatives' new \"bottom-up\" approach will be tested in local government and housing as the party pledges a genuine devolution.</p> <p>Local government financing could be taken out of the hands of ministers who currently control the funding of 80% of council services. The overall level of funding would be decided centrally but the distribution would be set independently.</p> <p>The Tories say the government is setting unrealistic house building targets - 3m new homes by 2020. Instead of issuing central targets they will encourage local communities to accept new homes by introducing incentives.</p> <p><strong>Policies</strong></p> <p>\u00b7 Allow local authorities to retain a portion of local business rates</p> <p>\u00b7 Dismantle the \"bureaucratic quangocracy\" of regional assemblies and regional development agencies</p> <p>\u00b7 Remove council tax capping and instead hold local referendums to approve increases in council taxes \"more than the norm\"</p> <p>\u00b7 Encourage housebuilding by allowing local councils to keep the proceeds from council taxes paid by residents in newly built homes</p> <p>\u00b7 Scrap home information packs (Hips)</p> <p><strong>Demos progressive rating</strong></p> <p>2/5</p> <p>Referendums in place of council tax capping is a bold democratic move, but will also test the strength of local polities. \"Bureaucratic quangocracies\" make for good political targets, but it is not clear what the Conservatives would do to support economic development in disadvantaged areas</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/10/conservatives.local.government\">Read more: local government and housing policy</a></p> <h2>10. Foreign affairs</h2> <p>The Conservative approach to foreign affairs embodies the old and the new.</p> <p>On the new side, Cameron has pledged to meet the UN target on aid spending.</p> <p>On the old side, Cameron would be Britain's most Eurosceptic prime minister. His plan to reverse Britain's ratification of the Lisbon treaty, if the measure has not entered EU law by the time of a British general election, would be opposed by virtually every EU leader.</p> <p>Cameron would have an easier ride with the transatlantic special relationship. He enjoys warm relations with John McCain and had a friendly meeting with Barack Obama in July.</p> <p>Describing himself as a liberal Conservative in a speech in Islamabad last week, Cameron sought to reshape Tony Blair's \"liberal interventionism\" when he said he was sceptical about \"grand utopian schemes to re-make the world according to a politician's timetable\". His visit to Pakistan and Afghanistan was designed to underline a key theme: that there is no longer a separation between foreign and domestic affairs. They come together under the heading of \"national security\", because what happens in Pakistan now has a direct bearing on Britain.</p> <p><strong>Policies</strong></p> <p>\u00b7 Meet UN target on aid spending - 0.7% of GNI - by 2013</p> <p>\u00b7 Create a national security council, to be headed by Lady Neville-Jones</p> <p><strong>Demos progressive rating</strong></p> <p>3/5</p> <p>Europe remains the Conservatives' achilles heel in foreign affairs. Until Cameron gets Europe right his efforts to sketch a 21st century foreign policy will fail. But the Conservatives have developed a thoughtful approach to international development, especially on issues such as corruption and governance, aid effectiveness, and fragile states</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/10/conservatives.foreign.policy\">Read more: foreign policy</a></p>",
  "<p>Britain's trade deficit in oil climbed to its highest figure on record in July, although there was a modest narrowing in the overall trade gap with the rest of the world.</p> <p>The Office for National Statistics said that Britain's goods trade deficit shrank to \u00a37.6bn in July, from an upwardly-revised \u00a37.9bn in June.</p> <p>The goods trade gap with non-EU countries was broadly flat at \u00a34.7bn. The balance on trade in oil was in deficit by \u00a31.3bn in July, compared with a deficit of \u00a3700m in June. The ONS said this could be a result of changing maintenance patterns at North Sea oil rigs and also because the high price of oil meant fairly small changes in volumes can have a big effect. </p> <p>Paul Dales at Capital Economics said: \"July's UK trade figures provide very little evidence that exporters are feeling the benefits of the lower pound. Admittedly, it takes time for the effects of the lower pound to be felt.</p> <p>\"But a significant surge in exports seems unlikely when the overseas environment \u2013 particularly in the UK's largest export market, the eurozone - remains so weak. Overall, today's data increase the chances that net trade will make another positive contribution to GDP growth in Q3. But we doubt that it will be enough to prevent overall GDP from contracting.\"</p> <p>Howard Archer of Global Insight said he expects UK exporters to benefit from the weaker pound although he cautioned that this will be increasingly countered by muted demand in key overseas markets.</p>",
  "<p>Ask about Fernando de Noronha when you're in Sao Paulo, and your enquiry will invariably meet with a combination of wonderment, national pride, jealousy and misinformation. Fernando de Noronha is an island \u2013 named after a 16th-century Portuguese nobleman who may never have actually set foot there \u2013 that exists in the Brazilian imagination somewhere not far from Shangri-la, Atlantis and paradise. People glaze over when you mention it: eyeballs tend to roll upwards in that universal gesture of delight.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337448902\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2008/09/09/Fernandoi.jpg\" alt=\"Fernando de Noronha, Brazil\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: Herve Collart/Sygma/Corbis</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Herve Collart/Sygma/Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We were told by friends, acquaintances and strangers \u2013 none of whom had actually been to Fernando de Noronha \u2013 to expect the most spectacular beaches in all of Brazil. Some were certain that jet aircraft are barred from landing there; others warned that there is only one hotel and absolutely no internet. Naomi Campbell, we were reliably informed, goes there to unwind after Sao Paulo Fashion Week, but \u2013 far from being just a bolt-hole for the wealthy \u2013 it is also a fiercely protected eco-wonderland, favoured by naturalists and marine biologists. The island's luxuriously warm and unsullied emerald waters are, it was widely agreed, teeming with dolphins and turtles. What's more, the consensus assured us that every type of shark common to the area is, in fact, friendly.</p> <p>Like most people from outside Latin American we had never heard of Fernando de Noronha, and because less than half of what we'd been told seemed even remotely plausible, we turned to Charles Darwin for supporting testimony. He stopped there in 1832, after one of his crew had harpooned a porpoise for supper (Darwin was evidently no Dr Dolittle), but spent only a day \"wandering about the woods\" before setting off in hopes of finding \"greater wonders\" elsewhere. His account \u2013 except for reports of \"a conical hill, about one thousand feet high, the upper part of which is exceedingly steep\" \u2013 is distinctly underwhelming. Would this living paradise, in reality, turn out to be little more than a product of mass exaggeration? Or would it live up to the hype?</p> <p>Fernando de Noronha is, strictly speaking, an archipelago made up of one 11-square-mile chunk of volcanic rock and 20 smaller islands, three degrees south of the equator, 220 miles from Brazil's north-eastern coast. The flight from Sao Paulo \u2013 on a modern passenger jet, for the record \u2013 pauses briefly in the seafront city of Recife before continuing out into the Atlantic, and touching down on an airstrip that occupies a large portion of the lush, green interior. From above, the promise of an outrageously attractive wonderland \u2013 glinting turquoise sea, pristine sand \u2013 is instantly made good.</p> <p>After happily coughing up an Environment Protection Tax at the airport (seven days costs about \u00a365 per person), we were taken by Land Rover to our hotel \u2013 the Pousada do Vale \u2013 a friendly place on a wooded lane near the island's first permanent settlement, the Vila dos Rem\u00e9dios. Within half an hour, we fully understood the basic climatic reality of life on Noronha during the rainy season (April to August) \u2013 bursts of blistering sunshine punctuated by torrential downpours. As a result, nature goes into overdrive: explosions of greenery; reptilian battalions of frogs and native, yellow-eyed mabuya lizards; and clouds of low-flying, almost invisible borrachudo mosquitoes that have a voracious appetite for human ankle flesh. Self-preservation quickly drove us to the most effective, but least environmentally friendly, of the two insect repellants offered by the pousada: not the ideal start on a Unesco World Heritage Site and designated maritime national park where swimming in sun-screen is, in places, forbidden lest the delicate eco-system be damaged.</p> <p>As night fell like a cosh, the island's split-personality began to reveal itself. All the evidence so far had marked out Noronha as a dream destination for tropic-hardened biologists, but the appearance of several smartly dressed couples, picking their way gingerly over rain-slicked cobblestones, confirmed its bread-and-butter identity as a magnet for well-heeled honeymooners. Their shoes were muddied, and their lower legs were \u2013 like ours \u2013 borrachudo'd, but they had paid good money for romance in paradise and no extremes of nature were going to take that from them. The remoteness of the island \u2013 and its perceived value as the perfect holiday destination \u2013 keeps prices (food, lodging) perennially high, on a par with pricier quarters of Sao Paulo, enhancing its exclusivity and mystique.</p> <p>The evening, spent over several cans of lager at a bar called Tom Marrom, surrendered a colourful procession of diverse characters: a local teenager rode past on a horse, followed by a man in a dune buggy who appeared to be modelling himself after Steve McQueen's Thomas Crown. The dune buggy turns out to be the island's most common form of transportation: not exactly the environmentalist's first choice, but practical given a road system structured largely around the pot-hole, the gully and the rut. The bar's waitresses wore fake pig-tails and painted-on freckles, and danced \u2013 between deliveries of food \u2013 to the live forr\u00f3 band. Forr\u00f3 is an accordion-based type of folk-dance music particular to the north-east of Brazil, with an intoxicating and swampy feel to it. One band member traditionally plays the triangle, which we assumed was the least-taxing, most Bez-like role, until our trianglist started to sing, very well, and instantly shot up in our estimation.</p> <p>After a night spent under the watchful eye of several mabuyas, we set about discovering that the best of Noronha is to be found on and under the water. A three-hour round trip by boat from the island's small harbour is as good an introduction to the island as any, and features a 40-minute snorkelling stop at the astoundingly pretty Baia do Sancho. En route we were shown rock formations that (sort of) resemble a dog, an Egyptian mummy and King Kong, caught passing glimpses of flying fish, a stray turtle and several javelin-shaped barracuda. The big draw, though, was the resident spinner dolphins \u2013 so-called because they jump clear of the water in acrobatic spirals \u2013 that turn up in their hundreds on a daily basis. You just can't argue with wild dolphins en masse: some would insist they're worth the hefty price of admission to Noronha alone.</p> <p>We could neither confirm nor deny the rumoured friendliness of the local sharks \u2013 the lemon shark, nurse shark and Caribbean reef shark are the most common \u2013 because we didn't see any, but we can state that there have been no reported attacks (touch wood). In marked contrast to the mainland coast near Recife, where environmental disruption has provoked a dramatic rise in fatal shark encounters, the protected marine eco-system around Noronha appears to offer the creatures all the sustenance they require. </p> <p>Other nature-based highlights included the walking route to Baia do Sancho, which involves negotiating two ladders on a sheer cliff-face and feels moderately adventurous, until you realise that it's regularly tackled by old ladies in flip-flops; and a lunch of freshly caught barracuda at Bar do Meio on the Praia do Meio, frigate birds circling overhead. Away from the beaches, the ruins of a prison offers a hint of life on Noronha before the modern tourist era. Gypsies (in 1739) and capoeira fighters (in 1890) were incarcerated there, unaware that their living hell would one day morph into a high-end eco-destination.</p> <p>Fish night back at the Pousada do Vale \u2013 during which the hand-delivered catch is wrapped in banana leaves and grilled \u2013 is free for guests on Thursdays. The hotel's two-storey \"bungalows\" have balconies with hammocks, and it was in one of them that we weighed up our thoughts on the island. Had Noronha lived up to the hype? No question about it, the place is gorgeous \u2013 whatever nature had taken away by sending deluges of Atlantic rain and vindictive insects, it had given back in spades with stunning marine life, dramatic rock formations and priceless sunsets. But there was still the sneaking suspicion that Fernando de Noronha has something of an identity crisis. By selling itself as both a strictly patrolled eco-paradise and a dream destination for the well-off \u2013 where bicycles are out-muscled by petrol-chugging buggies, and much of the food is flown in \u2013 the island comes across as confused. The price-tag for a holiday there is likely to deter many, but for honeymooning scuba divers who aren't short of a bob or two, Fernando de Noronha is a live contender.</p> <h2>Getting there</h2> <p><strong>When to go:</strong> Dry/high season (from September up to March) and rainy/low season (from April up to August)</p> <p><strong>Specialist operator:</strong> Tim Best Travel; +44 (0)20 7591 0300; <a href=\"http://www.timbesttravel.com\">timbesttravel.com</a>; info@timbesttravel.com</p> <p><strong>Where to stay:</strong> </p> <p>Pousada do Vale, Rua Pescador S\u00e9rgio Lino, 18 \u2013 Jardim Elizabeth; <a href=\"http://www.pousadadovale.com/ingles/\">pousadadovale.com/ingles</a>; +55 (81) 3619 1293.

  "<p>According to the government, Britain is <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7597276.stm\">\"uniquely placed to succeed in the global economy\"</a>. We're also \"enthusiasts for globalisation\", and global expansion is equated with \"massive opportunity\". We hear lots of positive rhetoric about globalisation benefiting the UK as a whole \u2013 which is spot on, at the national level. Look closer and there's a much more mixed picture from Reading to Bradford, from Milton Keynes to Stoke.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/communities\">UK cities</a> have been feeling the effects of globalisation for decades. We've seen a move away from a manufacturing to a service-based economy. Belfast lost 26% of its manufacturing jobs during the 1960s and employment at the city's iconic shipbuilding giant, Harland and Wolff, has dropped from 20,000 in the 1950s to just 120 today. While Liverpool's population has shrunk by 16% since the early 1980s, Milton Keynes has struck gold \u2013 its numbers have increased to 78% as the city's retail and logistics sectors boomed.</p> <p>Some cities are just better placed than others to seize the opportunities of globalisation. With Reading's transport and trading links it's no surprise to hear that 40% of its workforce is employed in the top 20 exporting sectors, twice the proportion in Stoke and Doncaster. That's not to say that we're advocating a mass migration south (remember Policy Exchange's big splash last month with their <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2008/aug/13/communities.regeneration\">Cities Unlimited report</a>). Doncaster might not be growing at the same rate as Reading but that doesn't mean it can't flourish.</p> <p>I'd like to see more realism from cities about their niche in the world economy. Not every city and town can be world class. In global terms UK cities are small, but their unique selling point is that they are located closely together. Sheffield, Liverpool, Bradford, Leeds and a host of other cities are all within a 40 mile radius around Manchester - the equivalent to London's travel to work area. To compete on a global stage, cities and towns need to collaborate with each other \u2013 working together to promote brands like \"Greater Manchester\" or \"Greater Birmingham\". </p> <p>Politicians cannot and should not reverse the tide of global economic change but they can be more up front about it. Gordon Brown acknowledged in his foreword to autumn's Labour Party conference paper that economic restructuring, driven by globalisation has meant reduced security for lower skilled workers. The next step is to focus <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/regeneration\">regeneration</a> spending in cities on those hardest hit \u2013 by reskilling those whose jobs have disappeared as a result of offshoring or industrial decline. Let's look beyond fancy new city centre buildings and address some of the challenges globalisation presents for UK cities. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Dermot Finch is the director of policy research unit Centre for Cities.

  "<p>For quiet rationality Alistair Darling's speech to the TUC yesterday was hard to fault. In troubled times, the need to maintain hard-won economic stability is more important than ever, he repeatedly told delegates in Brighton. They didn't dance in the aisles, but they didn't riot either. Darling in the lion's den was doomed to be a quiet encounter.</p> <p>The problem was that the chancellor's appearance on the rostrum was preceded by a protracted cry on pain and bewildered anger about the sheer unfairness of it all. This time (it is not always the case) the unions have an alibi: the economic crisis triggered by the credit crunch and the global commodity price spike is not their fault.</p> <p>Worse, much of the blame can easily be attached to their historic enemy, unbridled capitalism, in the shape of a greedy banking sector, bloated and overextended, which - as Darling said - didn't actually understand the risks it was taking.</p> <p>\"We only lend now to people where we understand the risk,\" one banker recently reassured Darling. But don't be fooled. They will do it again. They will. \"It's different this time,\" is a recurring battle cry of the speculator.</p> <p>In more demagogic hands than the chancellor's an anecdote like that could have got them cheering. There were other good lines like it. No more fat bonuses paid \"for big mistakes\" in banking - which should return to \"old-fashioned\" habits. No free ride for the energy giants - \"we'll do more, they must do more\". And as he rattled off those worthy reforms to improve the lives of working trade unionists since 1997, Darling said - several times - \"you campaigned for it, we agreed\" and did it.</p> <p>But Alistair Darling doesn't do red meat politics, though - as Private Eye pointed out this week - he did have a Trot phase in his political youth as a turbulent member of Lothian regional council, defying Margaret Thatcher's calls to cap the rates. It's hard to imagine now of this epitome of the clean-shaven, ultra-calm technocrat, as devoid as any politician I have known of self-promoting ego. He does extra winter fuel allowances and loft insulation, useful but uninspiring.</p> <p>So the TUC discounts its gains - don't we all? - and yesterday saw a succession of union leaders who should know better by now calling for renationalisation of the major utilities, electricity, water, gas and even the railways. A scandal that they remain in private hands 11 years after the return of a Labour government, said one.</p> <p>All right, the Tory privatisations have been a mixed bag, some of them expensive and not very good. But I am typing this in a clean, modern train carriage, speeding towards London, my laptop plugged into a power point. Most - not all - of my travel on the network is much better than it was. And, unlike for inflation, the unions do share some of the blame for the decay of the state-owned industries of the past.</p> <p>What Darling was trying to convince them of yesterday is the need to avoid a wage-price spiral of the kind we used to have in the Heath-Callaghan-Thatcher decades. Yes, oil and food prices have soared - lots of reasons for that: Iraq, the rise of the new Asian middle class, the ethanol fad - but they will settle down again. \"Tough times\", but we can get through them if we avoid the excesses of the 70s and 80s, the chancellor insisted. When inflation bites harder, the poorest suffer most and the rich - bankers included - get away with it. Some of life's unfairness is not susceptible to legislation.</p> <p>All of which is boring, but also true. Remember that the Chinese saying \"May you live in interesting times\" is a curse. We live in dull times; aren't we lucky? They may not last. Meanwhile TUC delegates, the rank and file rather less than their leaders, rage against \"obscene and immoral\" profits, the \"madness and gluttony\" of marketised energy policies, the sheer unfairness of the emerging two-tier workforce that denies decent pay and conditions to contract staff.</p> <p>Much of it is true and Darling's reminders of slow, incremental reforms (\"tips won't count as part of the minimum wage. You campaigned for it, we agreed\") are no match for stirring rhetoric and an overarching vision. \"A stable economy is not an optional extra, it's a means to an end - fairness,'' he told them. </p> <p>Admirable if dull sentiments, but it would take a Laurence Olivier or a Tony Blair to squeeze a round of applause out of such remarks. On TV yesterday's applause in the cavernous, antiseptic Brighton conference centre sounded even more tepid than the boos. The government may look anaemic, but so can the Brothers.</p>",

Marvel is now operating as a studio in its own right after buying back rights to most of its famous faces, and this year alone released Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk into cinemas.

The studio is already working on X-Men Origins: Wolverine, with Hugh Jackman reprising his role as the adamantine-clawed antihero, but there are also tentative proposals in play for a Young X-Men project, and a spin-off featuring the character Deadpool.</p> <p><strong>Val Kilmer</strong> will play a <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3i232ec0fada51eae72753ca664ea26ccc\">hostage taker in the independent suspense thriller The Steam Experiment</a>, according to the Hollywood Reporter. Kilmer's character is a former university professor who terrorises six people trapped in a Turkish bathhouse in an effort to prove that civilisation will descend into chaos under the pressures of global warming. Armand Assante, Eric Roberts, Megan Brown and Patrick Muldoon have also signed up to star, while Philippe Martinez will direct. Principal photography has already begun in Grand Rapids, Michigan, where the feature is set.</p>",

  "<p>All three main political parties have downgraded their commitment to the environment over the last year, a report by the UK's major green groups said today.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.green-alliance.org.uk/grea_p.aspx?id=3202\">Fit for the Future</a> study, which analysed the green performance of all three parties over the past year, said many politicians believed the economic downturn made action on the environment less of a priority.</p> <p>Over the last year, all three main parties had \"retreated from the environmental agenda\", said the report, which was drawn up by a coalition including the Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE), Friends of the Earth, Green Alliance, Greenpeace, National Trust, RSPB, the Wildlife Trusts, Woodland Trust and WWF.</p> <p>The only way out of the downturn was an ambitious climate change strategy that addressed energy, transport, and management, housing and the economy, the second annual review of the parties' performance said.</p> <p>The three parties must drastically improve their green performance in the run-up to the next election, the environmental organisations urged.</p> <p>Stephen Hale, director of Green Alliance, said on behalf of the groups: \"None of the three main parties are currently showing the vision and courage to prepare the UK for the challenges ahead.</p> <p>\"There is no long-term route to prosperity and security unless our political leaders tackle climate change and protect the natural environment.</p> <p>\"In a time of rising fuel and food costs, the need for an ambitious approach to environmental policy has never been clearer.\"</p> <p>The Labour government's approach to the environment had become \"incoherent and contradictory\", the report said.</p> <p>On the upside, the government had introduced the climate change bill and a draft strategy on renewable energy but there were concerns about the failure to rule out a new coal-fired power station at Kingsnorth, Kent, and Gordon Brown's trip to Jeddah to plead for higher oil production.</p> <p>The government won praise for protecting the natural world through measures such as the marine bill, avoiding a badger cull and protecting Lyme Bay from damaging fishing practices.</p> <p>But the green groups said the government should have used rises in fuel prices to push through a reduction in the UK's dependence on fossil fuels, and criticised the \"inadequate\" action on biofuels.</p> <p>The Conservatives came under fire for an \"increasingly alarming\" gap between their green aspirations and commitments, and for failing to mention the environment or climate change in their statement on priorities for a future government following the May elections.</p> <p>The party was also criticised for its negative attitude to green taxes and for sidelining its quality of life review, which set out a green agenda, but they did win support for saying no to dirty coal.</p> <p>Even the Liberal Democrats, traditionally strong on the environment, have seen their lead on green issues \"wane\" at points during the year.</p> <p>But they were applauded for Nick Clegg's commitment to making the UK energy independent and zero carbon by 2050, a move which was described in the report as \"brave and bold\", and for strengthening the climate change bill.</p> <p>The report called on all the parties to say yes to meeting targets to source 15% of energy from renewables by 2020 and to valuing the natural environment.</p> <p>It also said they should introduce a \"massive uplift\" in energy efficiency through public investment.</p> <p>And the parties should say no to unabated coal power stations and to expanding Heathrow or Stansted airports.</p> <p>The shadow environment secretary, Peter Ainsworth, said: \"We are continuing to take forward important policy proposals to make Britain greener and safer, including a major initiative on creating a low-carbon economy.\"</p> <p>And the Lib Dem environment spokesman, Steve Webb, said his party had been working in recent months on less high-profile but potentially more important measures such as strengthening the climate change bill.</p> <p>Responding to the Fit for the Future report, environment minister Phil Woolas said: \"We welcome the fact that the report acknowledges the good work the government is doing - both our flagship pieces of legislation, the climate change and draft marine bills, are cited.</p> <p>\"Government is committed to tackling environment issues and helping people through difficult economic times - it's not an either or.</p> <p>\"Our drive to increase energy efficiency in homes throughout the country illustrates that.\"</p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown today sought to defuse the row about his supposed endorsement of Barack Obama by lavishing praise on both US presidential candidates.</p> <p>At a press conference with the Italian prime minister this afternoon, Brown said that he had \"great admiration\" for Obama and his Republican rival, John McCain, and that both men were \"very distinguished senators\".</p> <p>He also insisted repeatedly that what happened in the US elections was \"a matter entirely for the American people\".</p> <p>Earlier, a Downing Street spokesman specifically denied that Brown was endorsing Obama in a magazine article in which the prime minister praised one of Obama's housing policies.</p> <p>Writing in the <a href=\"http://www.housemag.co.uk/index.php?id=315&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=8113&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=92&amp;type=editorial\">Parliamentary Monitor,</a> Brown said that the Democrats were the party in America who were developing ideas to help people through the current economic difficulties.</p> <p>He cited one of Obama's proposals to help families facing repossession. He did not mention the Republican candidate, John McCain.</p> <p>Brown was asked about the issue at his press conference this afternoon. In his response, he did not refer to the article directly, but he said that he had met McCain and Obama in Washington and in London and that he admired both of them.</p> <p>Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister, said that it would be \"totally absurd\" for a European leader to express a preference for one or other candidate in the US elections.</p> <p>After the article appeared yesterday, a member of McCain's campaign team contacted the British embassy in Washington, DC, to express concern about the article.</p> <p>The shadow foreign secretary, William Hague, said that the prime minister should not do anything that suggested he was taking sides in the election, as he would have to work with whoever eventually won November's election. </p> <p>He called on Brown to explain why he \"appeared to be favouring the Democrats\".</p> <p>In his article, Brown said that around the world it was \"progressive\" politicians who were grappling with the challenges of rising food and oil prices and the changes wrought by globalisation.</p> <p>He added: \"In the electrifying US presidential campaign, it is the Democrats who are generating the ideas to help people through more difficult times.</p> <p>\"To help prevent people from losing their home, Barack Obama has proposed a foreclosure prevention fund to increase emergency pre-foreclosure counselling, and help families facing repossession.\"</p> <p>Hague said: \"A responsible British prime minister needs to be ready to work with either presidential candidate after the US election, and should neither take sides nor be seen to be taking sides.</p> <p>\"Gordon Brown needs to make clear why he appeared to be favouring the Democrats in this article and to explain whether this was his deliberate intention or a careless mistake.\"</p> <p>A No 10 spokesman pointed out that Brown had met McCain both in London and the USA this year, just as he had met Obama.</p> <p>\"The PM is not endorsing a candidate, and never would,\" said the spokesman.</p> <p>\"As he has made clear when asked on a number of occasions, the election is a matter for the American people, and he looks forward to working closely with whoever is the next president across a range of areas of common interest.</p> <p>\"This was an article written ahead of the party conferences in Britain and talks about some of the measures being taken around the world by centre-left political parties to deal with the current global economic challenges.\"</p> <p>Downing Street also refused to say today whether Brown had read the article before it was published, suggesting that he had not.</p> <p>Parliamentary Monitor is a relatively obscure Westminster publication and, when senior politicians are asked to submit articles to magazines of this kind, they normally delegate the writing to their officials.</p>",
  "<p>If you want to get ahead, it's not what you know it's who you know. This is manifestly false if, say, you're a manicurist who wants to become a neurosurgeon. I can't help thinking that in this case knowing how to handle a scalpel rather than a nail file is fairly vital, no matter how many doctors you make friends with or how well you tell that joke about a very small pianist.</p> <p>Still, we've all realised after a short time in any job that the way to progress is a combination of sparkling repartee and not throwing up in the shrubs at company barbecues. You can be as good as you like, but the person who gets promoted will probably be the one who pretended to enjoy metal detecting and slaps people's backs when it counts. </p> <p>It makes sense, I suppose. If you have to work with someone every day it's pretty important that he or she is not an appalling human being. And it helps if he or she has things in common with you. So when it comes to hiring someone, you're more likely to pick the person who demonstrated that they share your love of putting ships in bottles or the sitcom Keeping Up Appearances while chatting in an informal setting.</p> <p>Dreadful as the prospect is, networking works. Which is why people have business cards, practice handshakes and, in extreme cases, play golf. No one knows why so many people choose to bond with their colleagues over golf. Perhaps because even the deeply unfit can play. Perhaps because \"business casual\" entails chinos and mobile phone holsters anyway, so everyone's dressed for it. Perhaps because it's so dull that talking about balance sheets is fascinating in comparison. Or maybe it's just that it's hard to chat while base jumping. </p> <p>Next time you are in a social environment working out how to do this networking thing without coming off as utterly desperate, be aware that other, less circumspect, individuals have you in their sights and are calculating whether they can use you for career advancement. We've all met these people. They talk to you at parties while looking over your shoulder in case someone more important comes past. You can see them assessing your precise social ranking and proceeding accordingly with their schmoozing. </p> <p>Social networking sites like Facebook have only exacerbated matters. You know how it is; you meet someone once, feel obliged to accept their friend request and then have to put up with their dreadful status updates and pictures of their holidays forever more. And even though they're not alerted if you defriend them, they will eventually discover you missing from their list and feel slighted. So you can't get rid of them. </p> <p>The same, however, is also true of their low-tech business cards. I've got a drawer-full, and keep finding others in the most unlikely places. I have no idea why, for example, one ended up in my bathroom cabinet next to the nail clippers. But I don't want to throw any away - even the one from the \"creativity coach\" - just in case they come in handy. So if you're the guy who put up my friend's TV mount in April, don't forget about me. I have your card and I'll be calling you sometime in the next few years. </p> <p>Of course the worst networkers are the namedroppers. It works on every level. If you're in a small company in Leicester, there'll be a junior member of staff who talks about this great conversation they had with the CEO in a lift. If you're working at MGM there'll be an extra who talks about shooting hoops with George Clooney. And refers to him as \"G\". </p> <p>This is unforgiveable and idiotic. Handily enough, almost everyone dislikes such people. And thus they achieve the exact opposite of their aims - de-networking or anti-schmoozing, if you will, sending them sliding down the career ladder at precisely the speed they hoped to be climbing it. In theory, at least.</p>",
  "<p>Wearing surgical masks and carrying umbrellas, residents in Gao'antun, Chaoyang district of Beijing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/31/beijing.pollution.protest\">blocked roads</a>, chanted anti-pollution slogans and refused to allow rubbish trucks to pass as dozens of police filmed them and appealed for calm. This happened just one week after the close of the Beijing Olympic Games. Another week later, a local official formally apologised to the public and promised to reduce the odor in 20 days.</p> <p>Many see this as a positive sign that Chinese government is becoming more transparent and democratic \u2013 possibly another Olympic legacy. But since residents have endured the terrible living environment for more than three years, no one should be very optimistic.</p> <p>Protest is strictly regulated in China. According to the law, people can only hold a protest after permission is granted from the authorities. Whether you can protest or not is at the officials' discretion. The protest zones set up in Beijiing in a rush weeks before the Olympics were supposed to allow people to have somewhere to stage their protests, but they stayed quiet during the games. Hundreds of applications were handed in, but none permitted. What an irony.<br> Is the application process actually a trap? Most people believe so. Two 80-year-old ladies were given a year's \"re-education through labour\" after applying to hold a protest to complain about their houses being torn down by property developers. </p> <p>It is also worth noting that police actively filmed people taking part in the peaceful protest and it will come as no surprise if participants get some trouble once the dust has settled. In Chinese there's an expression: \"Square accounts after the autumn harvest\" - which means to wait until after a political movement is finished to settle accounts with the leaders and their followers. Last year, in Shengzhou City in Jiangsu Province, tens of thousands of people went on the street to protest against local government who forcibly dismantled a 90-year-old man's house. Two months after the riot, police reviewed the films and arrested people who were involved.</p> <p>Peaceful protests happen from time to time, mostly in the big cities like Beijing, and mostly held by the middle-class people who fear to lose their jobs and freedom, and who won't use any more drastic forms of protest. Local police also tend to think twice before using force or causing a scene, not only because of the scrutiny of media, but also the participants' growing awareness of their rights. But it would be naive to imagine that peaceful protests is becoming a normal way to solve public complaints in China.</p> <p>Early this month, a <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D932LGU00.htm\">protest broke out</a> in the southern Hunnan Province. In Jishou, a small city, tens of thousands of people blocked streets and railways, demanding the return of their money invested in a private finance scheme. For years, the local property and mining firms extracted billions of yuans from local people by promising extremely high returns. </p> <p>Local officials clearly not only sanctioned the scheme, but were also directly involved in the investment. They are said to have taken their money out of the scheme about a month before the government announced its closure, causing losses for other investors. </p> <p>Having the police by their side to crack down any civil unrest, and having a tight grip of the local media to stop any bad news, officials in the rural areas behave like emperors. Nobody dares to challenge their authority. </p> <p>China is getting stronger economically. However in terms of democracy and transparenet governance, there have been more setbacks than steps forward in the past decade. Now, China is reaching an impasse which hinders further development. Without serious political reform, the country will not be able to solve the ever-intensifying social conflicts. What's looming large, and what's more threatening, is ever more drastic forms of unrest in remote and rural areas, rather than peaceful protest in the large cities.</p>",

  "<p>The oil price rebounded this morning after Opec announced a surprise cut in production in an attempt to halt the recent decline in the cost of a barrel of crude.</p> <p>Having fallen by almost 30% in the last two months to the fringes of the symbolic $100 mark, US crude jumped by over a dollar to $103.30 this morning.</p> <p>Brent Crude, which yesterday slipped as low as $99.34, rebounded to $100.63 a barrel after Opec claimed it was reining in production because the world is now oversupplied with oil.</p> <p>The unexpected cut in production was announced early this morning after Opec members met in Vienna. The cartel said that its members would abandon production increases that were announced this summer - when the oil price had soared to nearly $150 a barrel - and would stick to their previous quota limits.</p> <p>Assuming all its members agree, this would reduce Opec's oil output by 520,000 barrels per day, to 28.8m barrels, according to Opec president and Algerian energy minister Chakib Khelil.</p> <p>In a statement, Opec said that the oil price has fallen in recent weeks because of falling demand in the developing world, the strengthening US dollar, and an easing in geopolitical tensions following the end of military action in Georgia.</p> <p>\"All the foregoing indicates a shift in market sentiment causing downside risks to the global oil market outlook,\" it said.</p> <p>Even before the Vienna meeting, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/06/oil.oilandgascompanies\">some Opec members had called for a drop in supply</a> to prevent the cost of oil falling further. There were fears in the cartel that it could be heading for a repeat of the late 1990s, when it boosted production only to see the oil price plunge when global demand dipped.</p> <p>Most of the 520,000 a day cut will have to come from Saudi Arabia, which announced a production increase in July when political pressure from the West was at its height.</p>"
