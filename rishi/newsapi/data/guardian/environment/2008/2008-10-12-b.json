  "<p>Ashley Cole was one of the last <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/england\">England</a> players to emerge from the home dressing room here, the full-back eventually striding through the post-match mixed zone offering a \"thanks but no thanks\" to the waiting media. Above him the sound had been muted on a plasma screen upon which his wife, Cheryl, sat gawping at Simon Cowell's presumably scathing assessment of the X Factor's latest warbler. Cole skulked away with little more than a sheepish smile; there was to be only one pantomime villain in town on Saturday night.</p> <p>This is a player who has grown used to abuse. Every visit he makes back to Arsenal these days sees the vitriol overflow, his messy divorce from the club that had nurtured him still prompting rancour some two years down the line. Cole was not blameless in the controversy surrounding that defection, yet this was a rare occasion when the vilification had been directed on an international stage. One mistake, a horribly misplaced pass that allowed Kazakhstan to score and had Fabio Capello apoplectic in his technical area, saw his subsequent every touch booed by sections of the home crowd. The Football Association condemned the reaction as \"crazy\" and \"pointless\". It was undoubtedly bewildering.</p> <p>Cole is in good company. England players have been abused at Wembley for years, the rerunning on national television of the Graham Taylor documentary \"An Impossible Job\" last week offering a timely reminder of the catcalls that once pursued John Barnes in the national stadium. The winger did well not to be broken by the poisonous atmosphere of a World Cup qualifying game against Norway some 16 years ago, an evening on which nothing he did seemed to come off. Cole, in contrast, may not have been at his energetic best on Saturday but he was guilty of only one really crass error. That was all it took for all the pre-match pleas from Capello and his players for the booing to stop to be forgotten.</p> <p>The manager remains perplexed at the attitude. \"You have to help a player who makes a mistake, not boo him,\" he argued. The crowd at the new Wembley has quickly developed its own culture of heaping criticism upon individuals. Frank Lampard suffered for a prolonged period, as much a legacy of the perception that he is the personification of money-flushed Chelsea as an inability to stamp his authority on games at this level. There can be little empathy between supporters and players who earn as these do and are seen to quibble over how best to squeeze yet more money from their employers.</p> <p>Yet it is not only those squad members from Stamford Bridge who live on the edge of the national fans' emotions. David Bentley's refusal to play in an Under-21 tournament did not go forgotten. The suspicion lingers that England's support are on the constant look-out for a figure to berate, the grumbling discontent that this is a team of highly paid under-achievers never far away, though the abuse has become cruelly comical now. Fans have the right to react however they see fit to events out on the pitch. But when players make genuine mistakes, as Cole did, to boo frenziedly seems self-defeating.</p> <p>\"It's a lot easier to do well and play at your best when they're not booing you, obviously,\" conceded Lampard. \"You can be the most strong-minded player in the world but, when that happens to you, it makes your game a little bit tougher. The fans need to understand that anyone can make a mistake. By the end, the majority of the fans started to realise what was going on and tried to drown out the booing by clapping.</p> <p>\"It would be beneficial for every player and to the team to have the crowd behind us. People are starting to understand that. If we want to make this place a fortress then, first of all, we've got to play better - we've started to do that - and then we need the crowd behind us.\"</p> <p>Cole's error was all the more surprising given that he is currently enjoying his best domestic form since swapping Arsenal for Chelsea. \"When you hear that aimed at one of the best left-backs not just in Europe but in the world, then it's just not right,\" said David Beckham. The defender's subsequent eagerness to be involved in the game, searching for the ball down the flank, was evidence of a desire to make amends. \"He's a big guy and he can take things on his shoulders,\" added Rio Ferdinand. \"But the fans have to realise that if they're booing players, it's not going to enhance our performances.\"</p> <p>Mark Perryman of the England Fans supporters' group defended the reaction. He said he had not booed Cole but added: \"The players who get so excited when we cheer them should not get on the fans' backs when they boo. We have the right to give the manager and players some stick when they do something wrong.\"</p> <p>Accusations of laziness, particularly once they believed the game had been won, could be levelled at this England side, though Cole was not guilty alone of that. There were hints of complacency creeping in before he played his ill-fated square pass, his body shape awkward and his team-mates slow to react.</p> <p>As it was, a combination of the wake-up call provided by Zhambyl Kukeyev's goal and the visitors tiring late on paved the way for what appears, on paper, to have been a romp. Given the dissent in the stands, that may be the kindest way to remember this occasion.</p> <h2>Bothered by boos</h2> <p><strong>Ashley Cole</strong></p> <p>After a defensive error that cost the team a goal, Cole is the latest in a line of England players to suffer the verbal displeasure of fans.<br><strong><br>Frank Lampard</strong></p> <p>England were hardly scintillating in friendlies warming up for the current campaign and their stuttering display against the Czech Republic in August prompted grumbling discontent, with Frank Lampard booed when substituted in the second half. He was also targeted in October last year when coming off the bench in the Euro 2008 qualifier against Estonia.</p> <p><strong>David Bentley</strong></p> <p>Bentley had angered the England Under-21 coach, Stuart Pearce, after he withdrew from the squad for the summer's European Championship in Holland at a late stage in 2007 and fans were keen to express their disappointment in the striker when he came on as a substitute for the final 20 minutes of the 3-0 win against Israel in September.</p> <p><strong>Owen Hargreaves<br></strong><br>Hargreaves was greeted by loud jeering when he came on to replace Joe Cole late in the 1-0 win against Paraguay in the 2006 World Cup, with some fans believing he did not deserve his place in the team.</p> <p><strong>John Barnes<br></strong><br>There may have been a racist undercurrent to some fans' booing Barnes, although it was also a perceived failure to transfer club form to the international stage that prompted the criticism. Chris Waddle suffered the same fate.</p>",

Yet the problem is being largely ignored by national and international crime fighting agencies, it says.</p> <p>The UK-based charity has named several men it suspects of involvement in multimillion-dollar operations that have resulted in extensive environmental destruction, but who have not been successfully prosecuted. They include an Indian, Sansar Chand, who, according to an interrogation report from the Indian Central Bureau of Investigations, has sold more than 12,000 animal skins to Nepal-based traders. The report says his haul included 400 tigers and 2,000 leopards, worth up to $10m on the open market in China, where EIA investigators found similar skins openly, but illegally, on sale. Since June 2005 Chand has been in Tis Hazari jail in Delhi.</p> <p>Abdul Rasyid, an Indonesian businessman, has denied illegal logging of hardwoods such as ramin and balau in the protected Tanjung Puting national park. He was named by the Indonesian government in a list of individuals suspected of involvement in the trade. The country's forestry ministry alleged that he organised the trade in illegal timber, in an operation which the EIA said was overseen from Hong Kong and involved middlemen in Singapore. The case against him has since been dropped for lack of evidence.</p> <p>According to a signed confession obtained by the Zambia Wildlife Authority, Benson Nkunika admits poaching 38 elephants for their ivory using a range of guns including an AK-47 on the orders of an area warden in South Luangwa, the country's most famous national park.</p> <p>The EIA believes a network of environmental crime rings is thriving in the developing world, even in the ivory trade, which has been the subject of an international ban since 1989. \"It is clear the ivory trade is growing among organised criminals because of the increasing numbers of large seizures we are seeing,\" said Mary Rice, director of the EIA. \"That is reflected in the trade in wild cat skins and illegal logging. Seizures in the 1990s were typically of far smaller volumes.\"</p> <p>In a report published today which includes the findings of several investigations, the EIA concludes: \"Environmental crime generates tens of billions of dollars in profits for criminal enterprises every year, and it is growing. In part this is due to the proliferation of international and regional environmental agreements, leading to more controls on a range of commodities. It is also due to mutations in the operations of criminal syndicates which have been diversifying their operations into new areas like counterfeiting and environmental crime.\"</p> <p>The latest trend is the illegal trade in hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), gas compounds used in refrigeration and aerosols which are known to contribute to global warming. Julian Newman, an EIA investigator, said US authorities had intercepted the first attempts to smuggle HCFCs, which were intended to replace chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) but are now being phased out in the US.</p>",
  "<p>Thomas Cook has agreed to provide information on its carbon footprint after being \"named and shamed\" by investors last week, amid growing political clamour for change.</p> <p>The travel group was one of more than 100 companies in the FTSE 250 list of leading companies on the London Stock Exchange that declined to reveal how they were trying to tackle global warming.</p> <p>The reluctance of a large number of firms to respond to the annual survey by the Carbon Disclosure Project led 60 MPs to write to Gordon Brown demanding that carbon reporting should be mandatory.</p> <p>Thomas Cook, InterContinental Hotels and waste management group Biffa are just some of the groups that have refused to participate in the study. A spokesman for the travel group told the Guardian that it would from now on support the scheme, which was set up by investors holding trillions of dollars of assets under management.</p> <p>\"We can confirm that we did respond to the Carbon Disclosure Project and in doing so explained that we were unable to take part for the current project, but would do so in future years,\" said a spokesman for Thomas Cook. \"Given the year that the project was reporting on was the year of the merger of Thomas Cook and MyTravel, unfortunately we did not have a common set of measures for our newly formed group.</p> <p>\"We assured the Carbon Disclosure Project in our response in June 2008 that we have every intention to take part in the future. We are committed to operating in a responsible and sustainable way by minimising our negative and enhancing our positive environmental impact through cultural change and significant investment.\"</p> <p>Nick Clegg, leader of the Liberal Democrats, and former environment ministers Michael Meacher and Elliot Morley are among the signatories to a letter to the prime minister expressing grave concern that the government has weakened a provision in the Climate Change Bill to force companies to disclose their carbon footprint.</p> <p>\"It is absolutely essential that we know how much CO2 companies are pumping into the atmosphere if we are to have any chance at all of combating the disastrous consequences of climatic change,\" said Morley, who has been working with companies and campaign groups that are part of the lobbying Aldersgate Group.</p>",
  "<p>With the markets going haywire, and investors concerned that their savings could disappear in a puff of smoke, a growing number of people are choosing to transfer their money into something more tangible than a bank account. There have been queues outside some bullion merchants, and one online gold broker, Bullion Vault, is opening around three times as many accounts a day as it was in early September. One couple told the BBC website they had gone so far as to sell their house and invest the cash in gold. \"The phones haven't stopped ringing,\" says a spokesman for bullion merchant Baird and Co. </p> <p>Gold's appeal is that it is less prone to the fluctuations of the global market. Its value is fixed twice a day by the five members of the London Gold Pool. On Friday afternoon it sat at just over \u00a3526 a troy ounce (the unit of weight for precious metals) - although this is expected to rise. </p> <p>The London Bullion Market Association publishes a guide for those wishing to buy over the phone, online or in person, and you should note that, as a commodity, it is subject to capital gains tax. Dealers sell bars varying from one ounce to 100 ounces or larger, or you can buy gold coins - if you can find them. \"We can't buy any more coins,\" says the spokesman for Baird and Co. \"There are no sellers, only buyers right now.\" </p> <p>Many people choose to invest in exchange-traded funds or buy stocks in gold mining companies. However there may be transaction fees, and an added risk of volatility. You could cut out the middle man and stash your gold at home, though it's worth considering the extra insurance costs - and the added lumpiness to your mattress. From a financial point of view, there is little point in panic-buying jewellery - you will pay extra for the craftsmanship, and the metal will be less pure than investment-grade gold.</p>",
  "<p>When there are grey skies, who minds those grey skies, if we've got you, Sunny Grandpa? Which is probably the most immediate way for any devoted Strictly Come Dancing fan to pay homage to Bruce Forsyth (80) and raise a couple of little frowns for Gordon Brown. Two matching themes go in parallel here. One is the reality gap between running a TV hit show and running a government. The other is the sheer mound of enjoyment - hilarity, exuberance, absolute good humour - that fits with a familiar grin. Nice to see you, to see you nice. Or, in updated mode, I'm not doddery, doddery I am NOT !!!</p> <p>Every weekend now, as the long march towards Christmas grinds on, Britain has a crunchy Saturday night choice: go out and spend money you haven't got, or stop in and watch the X Factor and Strictly battle it out for audience domination. It's quite exciting in a sedentary sort of Royle Family way: 9 million here, then there, as the lead swaps and swaps again. Judge Cheryl Cole has been a powerful new factor in marking the X spot. And maybe old Bruce - as the sixth series started - was a bit off the pace? Who needs a groan of gags to trip the light fantastic?</p> <p>But spending a night in the Wood Lane audience enters a quite different verdict. On screen, Strictly Come Dancing seems a shrewd blend of glitzy dresses, rigid technique and exaggerated emotion. Amid the toned flesh of Studio One, though, it's pure pantomime. \"Oh no it's not,\" Forsyth shouts at the audience. \"Oh yes it is,\" we reply. </p> <p>The heavy lifting gets under way hours before transmission as a junior warm-up chap tells us when to clap, stand, laugh - and then the maestro takes over. He sings a song, does a dance, pounds patter. He tells us how important we are and how much he appreciates us: which may even be true. Because, recording one show and then going on to record Sunday's results show on top (a near five-hour marathon) is a constant struggle between exhaustion and exhilaration. We have to damned well enjoy ourselves to keep the party going - and he has to make sure we enjoy ourselves, because that's what he does.</p> <p>Oddly, after a TV career stretching back six decades, it is live audiences that turn him on. See them, touch them, tickle them, and he comes alive, too. At the end, the last tango danced, the next contestant tearfully eliminated, he and his statutory blonde crave one final indulgence. They've got to record three trailers - 30-seconds-plus - to drop in programme breaks. He must be dog tired; he's been on the move constantly; but he delivers those word perfect as well. The real word, as you troop home, is obvious and overwhelming: professional; he's a honed force of nature. </p> <p>You may not see that so clearly later on the Sky Plus circuit. The jokes you laughed at seem more limp than jive. But at least you know that one amazing octogenarian can take the weight of a hugely complex show on his shoulders and carry it off in triumph. And you also know that the dancing would stop, or stumble, if he wasn't there. One very senior citizen makes the good times roll as meltdowns and bail-outs come flooding in and politicians say we need \"Serious men for serious times\".</p> <p>But that's not right on Saturday night. Then you need funny men for diverting times; and the lesson spreads just a tad wider. We're used to politicians lamenting poor participation at elections. We don't turn out. We stay slumped to vote in reality shows. But where's the Forsyth figure who might make a party party? What conference shows participants enjoying themselves today? How do we go from glum to giggle?</p> <p>Alistair Darling doesn't do one-liners. And the great clunking fist clenches as Gordon glowers and flies off to save the world, puffed by purpose. The gloom seems relentless, relentlessly confected: and no wonder national morale takes a cold bath as our leaders reach for tepid taps of despair. But what's the point of wanting to lead if it makes you (and everyone else) miserable? The way John Sergeant looks at Bruce and grins makes two worlds come together. </p> <p>Time for a reshuffle and a secretary of state for national amusement? It may look strange, but it's also strictly necessary for any real global rescue plan. Fun to be here, to be here (sort of) fun.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:p.preston@theguardian.com\">p.preston@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Commiserations, fellow victims of the global economic meltdown. If it seems as if I'm concentrating on just one story over on benlagenlive.com this week, that's because there is just one story this week. I may have covered the subject before, but now it's personal.</p> <p>I confess that up until last week I found the banking crisis merely interesting.

It's all there - the shrieks, the tears, the being put on hold, the not being able to understand someone's accent, the getting cut off, the calling back - all pretty characteristic of the attitude of these arrogant fatcats who think \u00a3147 is not a lot of money.

  "<p>The first thing that strikes you about Simon Pegg and Nick Frost's writing room is how clean it is. There are a few Star Wars action figures and the odd movie poster but mainly it's white walls and untouched carpet - which seems a little inappropriate for the nation's greatest on-screen slobs. \"It's just been decorated,\" says Pegg defensively. \"And we're married men now,\" adds Frost.</p> <p>It may also be because the duo are just too busy to make a mess. With How to Lose Friends still pulling in the punters at the cinema, and two movies going into production next year - their road movie, Paul, and the third in Pegg and director Edgar Wright's blood-and-ice-cream trilogy, The World's End - Pegg has decided this would be a good time to return to the small screen, writing and producing Life and Other Distractions - a 13-part comedy drama for Channel 4.</p> <p>\"These days, if you want to be a film actor you have to be careful with TV because it's that old thing - if people see you all the time on TV they're not keen to pay to see you at the cinema,\" he explains. \"That doesn't mean I don't love TV. This idea really appealed.\" </p> <p>The show will be a light drama about a family aimed at younger viewers, Pegg says. \"My involvement will be limited but I want to be a showrunner and have script control. I was interested in that age group, having grown up with shows like Grange Hill, and I wanted to do something outside my comfort zone. It's more kitchen sink than my usual stuff - having said that, any episodes I write will probably involve aliens and monsters.\"</p> <p>Pegg's ambitions reflect those of Big Talk, the company behind all his ideas since the 1999 sitcom Spaced. It has just sold a 25% stake to the BBC's distribution arm BBC Worldwide - which has been charged with seeking massive commercial expansion - and has recruited senior executives from across the industry. Kenton Allen, the BBC's former creative head of comedy, who has the Royle Family and Ideal on his CV, joins as joint chief executive; Luke Alkin, C4's ex-head of drama commissioning, is on board as executive producer for drama; and Skins producer Chloe Moss is drama development producer - all following Matthew Justice, who left Lunar Films to become Big Talk's managing director. </p> <p>The hope is that Big Talk will be able to develop movies, dramas and TV comedies with guaranteed global distribution through the Worldwide deal and a tight relationship with Working Title - which has funded all of Pegg's previous movies.</p> <p>With so much in development, Big Talk has had to expand, says its founder and chief executive, Nira Park.\"We've just signed a deal with Film 4, we have 18 films in development, we have drama in development with Channel 4, three films with Working Title and there was just me, Simon, Nick, Edgar and our head of production,\" Park says. \"We needed other people and people similar to us.\"</p> <p>At the same time, however, Allen's move from broadcaster to indie reflects a trend across the industry. ITV's controller of drama, Andy Harries, Michele Buck, controller of ITV productions, and Damien Timmer, executive producer at United Productions, have all made similar moves in the last 12 months. Could C4's budget cuts, ITV's exit from the FTSE 100 and threats to the BBC's licence fee mean talent is fleeing to the indie sector?</p> <p>\"I don't agree British broadcasting is collapsing,\" Allen argues. \"The BBC spends more money on comedy than any other broadcaster, but there's a bigger world out there. If you make a brilliant show for the BBC, more often than not, when the transfer happens it doesn't happen with you. As much as you want to look after that show as it crosses the Atlantic, your heart should be in giving the licence payer what they pay for - more British programming. With all the excitement about British comedy in the US - from The Office to Peep Show - it's a good time to not be in-house.\"</p> <p>A US influence can also be found in \"first look\" and development deals that Big Talk are in the process of signing with Robert Popper - who commissioned Spaced at Channel 4 and produced Look Around You and Peep Show - and Simon Curtis, the drama producer-director behind Cranford. The company's slate includes Jeremy Dyson adapting Jonathan Coe's What a Carve Up! for TV and a \"will they won't they?\" sitcom for Channel 4 called Free Agents, starring Sharon Horgan, Anthony Head and Stephen Mangan, which is due to hit screens in January. </p> <p>Will so many projects dilute the family atmosphere of Big Talk? \"There's no ambition to grow into a monolithic entity like Talkback that produces gardening programmes and series on dog training,\" Allen insists. </p> <p>\"It would be a shame if Big Talk lost its quirky editorial slant through huge growth,\" says Andrew Newman, C4's head of comedy and entertainment. \"They are one of the few companies who are yet to have made anything bad. It's all down to quality control and I think Nira has the judgment and relationships with people to make sure that doesn't happen.\"</p> <p>Pegg certainly doesn't see a problem with Big Talk replicating something like a US studio on a smaller scale. \"Working Title is the only British film production house that can get a British film made by itself,\" he argues. \"We like working with them. But it would be nice if there were other companies like that because it would mean a healthy British film industry.\"</p> <p>Big Talk's Worldwide deal, which will provide cash and confidence for expansion, is key to the company's aspirations. </p> <p>\"Distribution is becoming crucial to your business plan,\" Park says. \"Broadcasters are cutting what they pay per hour, so we have to use our knowledge of film financing, co-production and the like to make the kind of shows we'd simply get the budget for a few years ago.\"</p> <p>However, with Worldwide executives shortly to appear in front of the culture, media and sport select committee to explain its rapidly expanding commercial agenda, government curbs on Worldwide's activity could yet seriously hinder Big Talk's expansion. </p> <p>Not that the talent would be likely to leave if that were the case. \"Working with anyone other than Nira would be a step down,\" says Frost. \"I've worked with other independent companies and, to be honest, they've always seemed a bit hackneyed.\"</p>",
  "<p>Banks will be forced to accept lower levels of profit as controls on their debt-fuelled expansion are tightened to prevent a re-run of the current crisis, the international body responsible for global financial stability warned at the weekend.</p> <p>Mario Draghi, chairman of the Financial Stability Forum, said that in the new post-credit crunch world, banks would have to carry less debt and have higher capital reserves in order to prevent the \"perverse incentives\" that were at the root of bank collapses throughout the world.</p> <p>\"It's what everybody now understands,\" Draghi said in Washington. \"It seems easy, it seems simple, but somehow it's a very difficult concept to put in people's heads, for one reason: profits are going to be lower in the financial services industry in the future.\"</p> <p>The FSF, which includes central bankers and financial regulators, said that since the fire sale of Bear Stearns in March, \"strains in the financial system have deepened to unprecedented levels, necessitating extraordinary emergency measures.\"</p> <p>In a report to G7 finance ministers at the International Monetary Fund in Washington this weekend, the FSF said work was under way on a comprehensive reform package to tighten accounting standards; force banks to reveal their exposure to complex derivatives trades and prevent excessive lending in boom times.</p> <p>Draghi said there was a close link between lack of transparency and the run on bank shares. \"When the market doesn't know what's in the balance sheets, it is bound to ask for more capital.\" He said the previous rules of the financial market had encouraged an explosion of off-balance sheet vehicles, because banks were not required to hold capital against them. </p> <p>He urged governments to work closely together in tackling the crisis, warning that if one country offered weaker financial support for its banks and their savers than another, there was a risk that speculators would move in to attack institutions.</p> <p>Draghi said that it would be impossible to repair the damage to the financial system overnight. \"Credit markets have dried up everywhere. Liquidity has been drying up for many months. We don't have a silver bullet to change this in a minute.\"</p> <p>The FSF said it would closely monitor the global response to the crisis and seek to ensure that emergency plans produced by individual countries were consistent with each other. It added that it wanted to mitigate the \"pro-cyclicality\" in the financial system, a trend that encourages banks to lend excessively in good times, but to rein in credit when it is most needed.</p> <p>It will insist that banks hold more capital, take a more cautious view of possible losses and reform pay structures that reward risky decisions.</p> <p>Draghi said that while much of the FSF's work was for the medium and longer term, there were two reforms that would help to alleviate the current crisis. He called for a central body to be set up to act as a hub for the market for so-called \"over-the-counter credit derivatives\", the complex bets between investors. He said the current system left individual institutions dangerously exposed, and a centralised system would reduce the systemic risk. The second reform was for better accounting standards, so off-balance sheet activities were disclosed and open to valuation. </p> <p>Credit agencies also came under criticism from the FSF, which called on them to come up with better rules for assessing the risk from products such as mortgage-backed securities.</p>",
  "<p>We have arrived at the witching hour of this financial crisis. The tumultuous events of the past month have shredded confidence, destroyed trust and left markets in a petrified state. Last week's fall in the Dow Jones Industrial Average was the biggest in its 120-year history. Even during the Great Depression, the Dow never fell by 18.2%. The market capitalisation of General Motors was lower on Friday than it was in 1929.</p> <p>The annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund at the weekend exuded a scent you sniff only rarely at the gatherings of the global great and good: naked fear. The crisis can now only go one of two ways. Either the steps proposed by the G7 and the IMF to prop up the banks and reopen the financial markets work or they don't. </p> <p>If they work, last week's panic will prove to be the nadir of the crisis, followed by a period of nervous stability and gradual recovery. If they don't, and markets shrug off the latest rescue attempt, just as they have every other one, the consequences will be severe. Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the managing director of the IMF, said on Saturday that the world was on the brink of systemic financial meltdown, and that view is widely shared. </p> <p>With the benefit of hindsight, every central banker, every finance minister and every regulator now gets it: the financial world as it was before August 9 2007 was an accident waiting to happen. Banks were over-leveraged and under-capitalised. They were subject to perverse incentives that made them reckless and greedy. When this is all over, there is a consensus that this must never happen again.</p> <p>But first we have to get out of the current mess. There are reasons to hope that the worst is over. Desperate times force policymakers to be bold and to cooperate: there was an acceptance last week of the need for coordinated action, even if there is not yet total consensus on what that action should be. </p> <p>The recapitalisation of British banks will start this week, and other countries - Germany and the US - have already agreed to follow suit. There are three other reasons for optimism: oil prices are coming down rapidly, thus reducing inflationary pressure; parts of the emerging world, especially India and China, are growing fast; and policymakers know from the history of the 1930s the mistakes they have to avoid.</p> <p><strong>Determination</strong></p> <p>But they will need ingenuity, determination and every ounce of luck to succeed. The outlook for the global economy has changed beyond recognition in the four weeks since the US government decided that Lehman Brothers would be allowed to fail, and the IMF's forecast of a relatively short-lived recession across much of the west next year is contingent on calm returning to the financial markets over the coming weeks.</p> <p>It may not. There are, inevitably, investors nursing heavy losses from the mayhem of the past month, and it will take time for the wreckage to float to the surface. It would come as no surprise were there to be a fresh wave of failures among hedge funds, and there was already evidence last week of assets being liquidated to cover losses. As Strauss-Kahn noted, the US and EU countries have unsuccessfully taken \"extraordinary measures\" to restore market equilibrium.</p> <p>Alistair Darling's Treasury plan to recapitalise strategically important banks and provide them with guarantees for new lending was an attempt to draw a line in the sand. The analysis was right: the main problem for banks is that they lack capital and in a climate of fear and suspicion the only provider can be the state.</p> <p>Concern that any bank, no matter how big, may fail has gummed up the interbank market, in which banks lend to each other. Darling's guarantee is supposed to put the missing ingredient - confidence - back into the system.</p> <p><strong>Grotesque</strong></p> <p>The Treasury plan is clean and simple, and an example of how creative officials can be under immense pressure. Let's be clear, though. This is not a case of Britain charting the world out of its financial imbroglio through disinterested altruism, which is what Gordon Brown would have us believe. It is because 11 years of grotesque government toadying to the City has left Britain in a parlous position and there was no alternative but to resort to concepts expunged from the New Labour lexicon. </p> <p>Nationalisation is no longer a dirty word in Whitehall, which is just as well since that is the way banks are heading.</p> <p>Darling and Brown are convinced that their plan will work, but there is an acceptance that wholesale nationalisation would be forced upon the government if the plan fails or succeeds too slowly. Strange things have happened during this crisis, not the least of which is that the IMF was last week praising in developed countries all the things it normally excoriates in developing nations. Structural adjustment plans for the poor have involved privatisation, liberalisation and deregulation. Structural adjustment plans for the west, it seems, comprise of nationalisation, subsidisation and re-regulation. The one-size-fits-all model of development is just one of the many sacred cows to have been slain over the past 14 months.</p> <p>Stripped of their ideological hang-ups, policymakers are rediscovering some of the policy lessons of their forebears: state intervention to bail out banks, deposit insurance, a coordinated easing of policy. It is this that provides hope the Fund is right when it says the worst will be over by the end of next year and that a slow recovery will begin in 2010.</p> <p>The events of the past month have made it more likely that there will be a deeper and more prolonged recession than the Fund is predicting. The spillover effects from the paralysis in credit markets are now being felt in the real economy, and policymakers are fully aware that failure to free the obstruction could unleash a wide-hitting tsunami of bankruptcies, job losses and repossessions. In those circumstances, it would no longer be fanciful, as it has been up until now, to make comparisons with the 1930s.</p> <p>Policymakers have made it clear that they will do whatever it takes to avoid a depression. Even so, the next couple of years are going to be ghastly, especially in Britain, where there has been an unhealthy dependence on the housing market and financial services. </p> <p>Gerard Lyons, the chief economist at Standard Chartered, believes the loss of output next year could be close to 2%, which would make 2009 a contender for the toughest year Britain has suffered since the second world war. As things stand, that looks entirely feasible.</p>",
  "<p>The US is to lose its power to appoint the president of the World Bank after the UK's development secretary, Douglas Alexander, brokered a deal to throw open the post to candidates from any country.</p> <p>Backed by European governments and developing countries, Alexander overcame resistance from the US and Japan to secure a reform he described last night as \"a significant step forward\".</p> <p>Washington has had the right to hand-pick the president of the World Bank since the institution was founded after the second world war, with Europe choosing the managing director of the International Monetary Fund.</p> <p>Alexander said: \"The agreement provides the opportunity for candidates to be nominated regardless of nationality. It will ensure that the best-qualified candidate is selected.\"</p> <p>Developing countries have grown increasingly frustrated at the stranglehold of rich nations on the two Washington-based multilateral bodies, with pressure for change accelerating after the controversial presidency of Paul Wolfowitz, who was forced to step down after a scandal involving his partner's promotion.</p> <p>Alexander said that more changes were needed: \"It is a significant step forward, albeit on a much longer journey.\"</p> <p>The bank's development committee yesterday was dominated by concerns that poor countries would fall victim to the global financial crisis. It backed proposals that will give countries from sub-Saharan Africa a third seat on its 25-strong governing board. </p> <p>The bank's president, Robert Zoellick, urged rich countries not to forget their pledges of financial support to the developing world. The bank believes the number of malnourished will increase by 44 million this year.</p> <p>Donor countries were also discussing whether to release a multibillion-dollar reconstruction package to Zimbabwe. Alexander said the tests a new Zimbabwean government would have to meet included respecting human rights and allowing charities into the country to deliver aid.</p>",
  "<p>New European campaign, new head coach, same old Leicester. Only once in the past decade have they lost their opening Heineken Cup fixture here, and the Welsh regions are still to conquer the meanest stretch of rugby turf in the east Midlands.</p> <p>The Ospreys departed with a losing bonus point, a potentially valuable commodity when the final pool sums are done, but the margin of their defeat could have been far worse. At least two Leicester tries went begging in the first half and four penalties from Toby Flood represented a relatively modest return for a typically hard-working Tigers effort.</p> <p>The absence of tries on a beautiful, still afternoon was scarcely the fault of Leicester's pack, who won a shedload of possession by picking apart the visitors' set-pieces and counter-rucking furiously. Tom Croft, catching the eye more than any other England-qualified No6, was superb and Martin Corry, on his 35th birthday, did not look like an old stager. It may just have been a reaction to calls from his mates pointing out he was now eligible for the \"vets\" team, but the former England captain looked as committed as ever. There is life in the old codger yet.</p> <p>And yet the Ospreys could still have nicked it. With three minutes remaining they hacked the ball downfield and forced a five-metre scrum, which they wheeled through 90 degrees to rob Leicester of the put-in. With Julian White off the pitch, the Tigers pack looked mortal and it seemed they might pay for their earlier profligacy. But Harry Ellis managed to obstruct Filo Tiatia and the replacement scrum-half, Rhys Webb, and the ball squirted away, allowing Ben Woods to cut off the danger. \"You're not thinking about losing, you're thinking about defending your heart out,\" said Croft. Whatever else Leicester can be accused of, they never lack ticker.</p> <p>It is too simplistic to suggest the Ospreys would have won had Gavin Henson not been suspended following an internal spat. Henson was unlikely to have been fit anyway and teams who shrivel up because one big-name player is absent do not deserve much. That said, the sight of James Hook missing two kickable efforts emphasised the slim margins involved and the Ospreys' coach, Sean Holley, cannot afford any complacency at home to Perpignan this weekend. \"It is not about one player,\" said Holley. \"We're a tight group. In any working environment you've got a set of values and rules and if any employee goes outside that he will be dealt with. The case is closed.\"</p> <p>Holley was keener to accentuate the positive - \"We're very pleased with the losing point, it means we're right in this pool\" - while his opposite number, Heyneke Meyer, joined Corry in praising Flood, who had limped off with a hamstring. \"I wanted him to step up to the next level and he was brilliant in attack and defence,\" said Meyer. If that was slightly overstating the case, the fly-half's kicking did look in tip-top order. \"I thought his performance, especially his goal-kicking, was absolutely first-class,\" said Corry.</p> <p>Munster lost their first game last season, away to Wasps, and still lifted the trophy in May. To do the same, the Ospreys will have to tighten up in the scrums and withstand pressure on their lineout rather better than they managed here. Had Johne Murphy not twice thrown the ball into the stand, rather than to men outside him, the Tigers would not have been held to a nine-point interval lead. The Ospreys pack, almost all Welsh internationals, took ages to establish a faint grip on proceedings.</p> <p>Even a Shane Williams drop-goal, with his left foot, required video confirmation that it had gone over via a post and neither he nor Hook, who supplied the odd gliding flash and one nicely struck penalty, could turn the tide. Derick Hougaard, Flood's replacement, kicked intelligently in the final quarter and the foot-stamping crowd reaction to the crucial scrum turnover summed up an occasion of few thrills but constant tension.</p> <p>\"I'd have loved to beat them by 50 points but that only happens in the movies,\" said Meyer, who is trying to become the first coach to win the Heineken Cup and the Super 14. If Heyneke can refresh the parts certain other coaches have struggled to reach, Leicester will not be remotely bothered about artistic merit.</p> <p><strong>Leicester</strong> G Murphy; J Murphy, Hipkiss, Mauger, Smith (Tuilagi, 57); Flood (Hougaard, 57), Ellis; Ayerza, Kayser (Chuter, 61), White (Cole, 66), Corry (capt; Blaze, 74), Kay (Wentzel, 69), Croft, Woods, Crane.</p> <p><strong>Pens</strong> Flood 4.</p> <p><strong>Ospreys </strong>Byrne; Walker (Biggar, 50), Bowe, Bishop, S Williams; Hook, Wells (Webb, 72); James (D Jones, 60), Hibbard (Bennett, 44), A Jones, A-W Jones (Gough, 66), I Evans, Thomas (Tiatia, 50), Holah, R Jones (capt).</p> <p><strong>Pen</strong> Hook.<strong> Drop-goal</strong> S Williams.</p> <p><strong>Referee</strong> A Rolland (Ireland).</p> <p><strong>Attendance</strong> 17,498.</p>",
  "<p>In three months' time, George Bush will be back on his ranch in Texas - to the world's relief as well as, increasingly plainly, his own. He may have spoken some wise words about internationally coordinated action against the global financial crisis after meeting G7 finance ministers at the White House on Saturday, but he is rapidly becoming part of the past. In 22 days, Americans will select his successor. The responsibility of leading the United States and the developed world through these increasingly grim times will soon fall to either Barack Obama or John McCain. </p> <p>Unless the current opinion polls are seriously wrong - or unless something new and decisive occurs in the campaign before November 4 - it seems likely that the responsibility will fall on Mr Obama's shoulders. Mr McCain built a strong position during the summer and came out of the conventions with a powerful bounce, largely caused by the novelty of his selection of Sarah Palin as his running mate. But as the final phase of the campaign got under way and with voters at last bending their minds to the long-running contest everything has moved consistently Mr Obama's way. The national polls currently give him an average lead of around seven points. This lead, moreover, is growing - the latest Newsweek survey has Mr Obama with an 11-point lead, while a Fox News survey has Mr McCain dipping as low as 39% among registered voters. Polls also show Mr Obama ahead in several swing states and competitive in states that normally vote for the Republican nominee.</p> <p>This is partly because the Palin candidacy has been exposed for what it is, a political firework rather than an electoral rocket that would carry Mr McCain to the White House. This has happened less because of the Troopergate inquiry or some sharp television satires - though neither of these has helped - than simply because the Alaska governor's credentials have been increasingly held up to the light. The simple truth is that Mrs Palin has been found wanting as a potential president. Mr McCain's chances of becoming the oldest president to take office in US history have been relentlessly undermined by the manifest inadequacy of the person who would succeed him if age or infirmity suddenly took their toll, and because that choice reflects so lamentably on Mr McCain's own judgment.</p> <p>The much larger factor, however, is the economy. The more that American voters have focused on their economic woes, the more decisively the presidential contest has shifted in Mr Obama's favour. This is partly because the Republicans are so deeply associated with the economic philosophy that is now in institutional freefall, partly because the Democrats are, in general terms, still the party of federal action to defend the disadvantaged, partly because the accelerating downturn has happened on the watch of a generally unimpressive Republican president and partly because Mr Obama has handled economic questions with more skill and substance in his debates with Mr McCain. Yet Mr Obama has also been careful to keep the dramas in Washington and on Wall Street at arm's length. The next president will face the most daunting economic agenda since Franklin Roosevelt. It is far from clear how Mr Obama - who regularly drops protectionist hints - would tackle this global recession.</p> <p>Right now, of course, his priority is simply to get elected. The exchanges are turning dirtier - again to the McCain campaign's shame - and the great unspoken question of Mr Obama's race seems likely to play an even more prominent part in the final phase. If the 2008 election becomes reframed as another culture wars contest then the current gap may narrow. As long as the economy is not just the main issue in voters minds but, as now, the overriding one, then it seems that Mr Obama will win. If he does, it will be a marvellous moment. But it will also be the moment when the real work starts.</p>",
  "<p>Can Roger Alton, now in his fourth month as editor, save the Independent? Anybody who expected him to reveal a dramatic new vision will be disappointed. There has been, as he puts it himself, what is better described as a tickle rather than a wholesale relaunch. \"I've never been a vision man,\" Alton insists. \"I try and put good stuff together and get it out.\" With full-colour printing and Alton's incomparable eye for presentational detail, the paper looks fresher and more energetic. Comment and analysis have more space, politics a higher profile.</p> <p>Will that be enough? True, other papers, including this one, make financial losses and nearly all struggle in a steadily declining market. However, with full-rate UK sales, for both the daily and Sunday paper, not far above 100,000, the Independent's problems are in a league of their own. The last recession, in the early 1990s, eventually forced its founders to sacrifice their independence and sell to Tony O'Reilly and the Mirror Group (as it then was). With the economic outlook darkening by the day, they had launched a Sunday paper (with me as news editor), believing - or so Matthew Symonds, one of the founders, told me - that recessions meant more competition for shrinking markets and, therefore, more advertising. That did not turn out to be true then and it will not be true now.</p> <p>So for Alton, the stakes are high. And I believe he is making one big strategic error. He would reject the term - \"crackers\", he says - but he appears to be going downmarket. That will not be evident to regular readers. To them, the paper probably seems as engaged with serious issues as it ever was. But I doubt if that is how it seems to casual buyers, which the paper must attract to survive. Even Stephen Glover, the paper's press commentator, acknowledges that \"he has lifted the paper's hem an inch or two\".</p> <p>When it raised its weekday price to \u00a31, it tried to woo readers with a series on love and sex. Last week, as the financial crisis mounted, much of its front page carried puffs for \"the best bespoke perfumes\", \"Galliano's wonder show\", \"sex with teacher\", \"the Jamie challenge\" and so on. On Wednesday, as Alistair Darling prepared his bailout, the Independent, above the fold, asked: \"Should you hug after a goal?\" By then, its rivals had largely dropped puffs in favour of bold banner headlines. Only on Thursday did the Independent present a front page that suggested we are living through once-in-a-lifetime events.</p> <p>For all the talk of saturation 24-hour coverage, big news still sells, with readers looking for papers that can explain authoritatively what is going on. As the former Express editor Richard Addis blogs (www.shakeupmedia.com), the financial crisis is a rare example of an event that is electrifying and complex and, therefore, peculiarly suited to explanation in print. Expect sales of the Financial Times to rise sharply. But many find the FT too esoteric, creating an opportunity for a paper such as the Independent which, I fear, it largely missed.</p> <p>I say all this with humility, because I have made similar mistakes myself. If circulation is flagging, an editor thinks, let's have glamour and sex on the cover to catch readers' attention. Then they will be amazed by the insight, wit and verve of our serious writers.</p> <p>The formula worked for Alton at the Observer but he should perhaps remember that the Independent, which now struggles hard to recruit new readers, once rose from zero sales to over 400,000 on the back of an explicit commitment to serious journalism. </p> <p>It is hard to see how the Independent can survive except as an upmarket (sorry, Roger) niche product. Charging more than its rivals and with less money for promotion, it needs to offer readers something not available elsewhere and, more important, be seen to do so. Addis suggests it should be a daily magazine, running features even on the front. I wouldn't go as far as that, but I believe the Independent should throw its resources into becoming a white FT, offering the most authoritative, in-depth and cerebral analysis of world affairs, domestic politics, science, environment, the arts, education, health, sport and so on, as well as business and economics for non-City readers. </p> <p>Perhaps that is what Alton intends. Certainly, the new Life section looks like a daily magazine of high culture. But it is hard to tell when it runs pages about the 10 best cardigans and the 10 best fruit bowls, both puffed on the front cover. Alton, I suspect, is being disingenuous when he denies being a vision man. It would be truer to say he doesn't like articulating visions, at least not to media commentators. But if he is creating a new identity for the Independent, or returning to an old one, he should send out a clearer signal to the reading public. And he should do so very soon.</p> <p><strong>Cold comfort for Icelandic investors</strong><br>Personal finance pages, you might expect, would have been well ahead of the story about the failed Icelandic banks, Heritable, Kaupthing and Landsbanki. All three have offered unusually high interest rates to British savers. There had to be a catch, and there was. Financial returns always bear some relationship to risk levels, and banks that offer the highest interest tend to be those most likely to collapse, remote though that possibility usually is.</p> <p>Did journalists explain this to readers? Not that I noticed. They put the banks' accounts at the top of the \"best buy\" tables and added warm recommendations. When doubts about Icelandic banks emerged among credit rating agencies, personal finance sections, if they mentioned it at all, assured readers that \u00a316,000 could be reclaimed from the Icelandic government and another \u00a319,000 from ours. The banks were still in the best buy tables last weekend.</p> <p>I recall only one business journalist - the Times columnist Patrick Hosking - who raised doubts about whether Reykjavik could pay up and whether it was worth investing in foreign banks for what, in most cases, would be less than \u00a3100 extra annual interest. Money Mail told readers last Wednesday: \"We got it wrong and for that we apologise.\" It added \"many financial journalists had savings with the bank\". Somehow I don't find that very reassuring.</p> <p><strong>Tribune Left to die </strong><br>Next time a union leader laments the biased coverage of the capitalist press, someone should remind him or her of Tribune. The weekly paper that once boasted Michael Foot as editor and George Orwell as a columnist has been owned by a union consortium since 2004. Now it looks set to close for want of \u00a3200,000. At least the capitalists manage to keep their papers going.</p>",
  "<p>\u00b7 Besides stretching the idea of \"London\" so it apparently includes residents of Edinburgh (Alex Salmond) and California (Steve Hilton), the Evening Standard's guide to London's 1,000 Most Influential People 2008 has raised eyebrows by continuing the feud between the Mail titles, including the Standard, and the Telegraph group. Among those failing to make the cut are Telegraph group boss Murdoch MacLennan. Richard Kay, the Mail diarist, is in, while Telegraph editor Will Lewis is left out. In a fine piece of flattery, dynastic group chairman Lord Rothermere is given a place - despite the Mail titles' late Damascene conversion to web enthusiasm - in the New Media top five.</p> <p>\u00b7 At the launch of Adam Boulton's book on the Blair years, former colleagues of Rosie Millard were surprised to hear the Bunter-ish Sky News political editor - who had invited Millard to it when she interviewed him - tell her \"for God's sake, don't let Anji [Hunter] see you here!\" So she left swiftly. Boulton's concern was evidently related to something in the Sunday Times interview; but those who heard him couldn't work out if it was a question about rumours of a teenage fling between his wife and Tony Blair (\"they say not, so not\", Boulton replied) that offended, or Millard's suggestion - after seeing him \"snaffling\" the biscuits served with their coffees - that \"presumably his impressive girth is the result of too many biscuits in too many hotel foyers\".</p> <p>\u00b7 Barely a lunch-hour seems to go by without Simon Shaps, the former ITV programming supremo, being spotted enjoying his current, more leisurely lifestyle at a well-known London media eatery. Last week he was sighted at Moro in Clerkenwell, where by chance a fellow-diner was Peter Fincham, Shaps's successor. A simian spy witnessed a slightly awkward encounter between them, but could only guess at what Fincham said: \"Thanks very much for Lost in Austen, but what the hell were you thinking of with Natural Born Sellers?\", perhaps? Two days before he bumped into not one but two current ITV execs at the Ivy when the global content tsar Lee Bartlett and commercial chief Rupert Howell did that sign that sometimes means \"let's have a drink\" and sometimes doesn't.</p> <p>\u00b7 It was high-fives all round in the Sun newsroom when the paper revealed the Starbucks practice of keeping taps running. The story wasn't so well received, though, in News International's cafe - a Starbucks franchise. Was that regular froth on the Sun reporters' cappuccinos, or the bile of Starbucks staffers? </p> <p>\u00b7 Until last week a mention of the word \"Iceland\" would have sent some newspaper picture editors scurrying to find a snap of Kerry Katona beaming over plates of sausage rolls and chocolate gateaux. But news of the country's economic turmoil left them scratching their heads. The FT came up with incongruously happy spa swimmers on Monday; before the Indy went one better with images of scantily clad dancers at a Reykjavik club. Full marks for the pretext-providing headline: \"Iceland: dancing on the brink of bankruptcy\".</p> <p>\u00b7 Do Mancunian binmen sport gleaming, even rows of white teeth? They do, ridiculously, if played by Steve Coogan in Sunshine. Comparison with photos of Coogan as Alan Partridge shows the gnashers have had a makeover, presumably to suit Hollywood. Pity he forgot to dirty them up again for the sake of dramatic plausibility.</p> <p>\u00b7 Last Monday Monkey suggested that - as Channel 4's radio plans had by then been reduced to the yoof station E4 Radio - Channel 4 radio kingpin Bob Shennan might soon be looking for alternative employment.

  "<p>For retail magnate Sir Philip Green, the rationale for his weekend shopping trip to Iceland to buy debts held by the country's collapsed banks should be obvious.</p> <p>\"If you're on your way home and you go past a house with a sign outside saying 'half price', you're going to knock on the door, aren't you?\" he said yesterday.</p> <p>The Topshop owner jetted to Iceland last Friday to negotiate a deal with the stricken Icelandic retail investor Baugur. It could deliver him, at a big discount, stakes in or control of high-street brands including House of Fraser, Mappin &amp; Webb, Oasis, Warehouse and Whistles. If it comes off, shoppers will be able to throw a stone on London's Oxford Street and be pretty sure it will hit a Green-owned store.</p> <p>As his advisers tried to untangle Baugur's web of debts and holdings, Green told the Guardian yesterday that the dynamic behind the deal was simple: \"There's a buyer and there's a seller and that's how business has always been done. It's just that there's not many buyers now.\"</p> <p>Green, 56, is one of the few tycoons with the funds to spare. With a personal fortune estimated at more than \u00a34.3bn by the Sunday Times rich list, he is Britain's ninth wealthiest man. He expects a significant discount on debts that he said yesterday could be worth \u00a31bn to \u00a32bn.</p> <p>His proposal may appeal to Iceland's authorities because it would inject a substantial amount of foreign currency into the country's monetary system. With most banks and private investors unable to raise funds, Green's move has highlighted the power of cash-rich individuals in the current climate. </p> <p>Green denied he was preying on a crippled investor, and said that the deal could help prop up confidence on Britain's high street, which is facing a recession.</p> <p>\"Its not my fault they have to sell,\" said Green. \"I don't want to see any of these brands fail. If something happens to shock the high street, that may get out of control. We don't want a major retail accident.\" </p> <p>He said the deal would take up to 48 hours to complete.</p>",
  "<p><strong>How bad are things?</strong></p> <p>Many policymakers now admit the crisis is the worst since the 1930s - the prospect of complete catastrophe for the world economy. There is a global loss of confidence in banking and financial systems. Banks are so worried about other banks going bust, they refuse to lend to each other. At the same time, investors are concerned about the world economy and share prices are plummeting. </p> <p>The freezing of bank credit cuts off the lifeblood of national economies and leaves firms and households struggling to raise funds. Business investment is shelved, household spending is crumbling, and unemployment is rising. The IMF at the weekend warned the world economy is staring into the abyss.</p> <p><strong>Why recapitalise the banks?</strong></p> <p>A chronic shortage of capital. Banks have been run on extremely thin layers of capital. This works when markets boom and banks can get wholesale funding. But banks have lost billions in US sub-prime loans and eaten into their capital base. Simultaneously, the credit market has dried up.</p> <p>Private investors will not give more capital to banks which they fear could go bankrupt because they have lost so much already. So governments around the world are offering to inject funds into leading banks, in return for a stake. </p> <p><strong>What if the bail-outs don't work?</strong></p> <p>If bank shares continue to fall, governments may be faced with wholesale nationalisation of national banking systems.</p> <p><strong>What if confidence doesn't improve?</strong></p> <p>If shares keep falling, there is the option of shutting markets for a while, as Russia did recently. However, this is not a lasting solution, because it does not fix the underlying problems. </p> <p><strong>What if there is a rush of bank failures?</strong></p> <p>Increasingly, the Great Depression can be a guide. Franklin D Roosevelt, on his first day after being sworn in as president, declared a four-day \"bank holiday\" which shut the system down.</p> <p>He did it precisely because of a string of bank failures had triggered a run on all the other banks and that had pushed the system to breaking point. The \"holiday\" worked. It not only helped stem the frantic run on banks, but gave Roosevelt time to push an act through Congress - a lot quicker than treasury secretary Hank Paulson managed this time. It led to a renewed flow of credit, although the US economy stayed depressed until world war two.</p> <p><strong>Would I still be able to get my money?</strong></p> <p>In 1999, Argentina could not pay its creditors and effectively was bankrupt. The government closed the banks for a year, allowing people to withdraw only small amounts of cash. That led to civil unrest and public protests, with much of the economy returning to barter. Hence governments around the world will use everything in their power to avoid closing banks.</p> <p><strong>What if the system stops working?</strong></p> <p>Banks are at the heart of today's economies; governments cannot let them fail, or firms would be unable to pay staff, and people could not use anything other than cash in shops. Chaos would ensue. </p> <p><strong>What's all this mean for the economy? </strong></p> <p>We are already into recession. Even the normally optimistic National Institute for Economic and Social Research thinks it started back in May. The economy may continue to contract until 2010. That will be bad in terms of lost jobs, collapsed firms, house price falls, and so on. Bank of England monetary policy committee member David Blanchflower has been warning for months \"something horrible\" was about to happen to the economy. It is happening now. This week's labour market numbers on Wednesday are likely to show another big leap in unemployment, and that is before the past month takes its toll. </p> <p><strong>Reasons to be cheerful?</strong></p> <p>Well, oil and commodity prices are tumbling, and food and petrol prices are already falling. In turn, inflation is about to drop sharply; that gives central banks leeway to cut interest rates to try to prevent too much damage to their economies. Although the problem has been the lack of credit, its price has been generally kept high by central banks worried about inflation. Don't forget it is only a few months since the European Central Bank actually raised interest rates. </p> <p>So a combination of flows of credit if the bank bail-outs work, combined with much lower interest rates, could just about head off Armageddon.</p>",
  "<p>If you want one image of how surreally upended politics has been in the wake of the financial crisis, try this one. Peter Mandelson was clapped and cheered by the parliamentary Labour party (PLP) last week. It has been a real shock to his system. He has gone about shaking his head in disbelief.</p> <p>The PLP no doubt startled itself. But it may have been right. I do think he is going to be important to the politics of the next year or two. It's all about Gordon Brown's second chance (and Peter's third) and how the prime minister plays the opportunity unexpectedly thrust at him by global financial meltdown.</p> <p>Brown's sunnier mood is easy to explain in psychological terms. Though he has a huge burden to carry, as he struggles to persuade other political leaders to agree to the kind of rescue plan the Treasury has devised, another and greater burden has been lifted from him. That was simply the burden of asking himself every day what he was for - what was the point of Gordon Brown? He knows again. We know too.</p> <p>Big-picture politicians relish crisis. Great events enthuse rather than crush them. What Brown found intolerable through many of the New Labour years was that serious politics was elbowed aside by the market economy. He might have been chancellor, but while the sun shone and inflation stayed low, and the City boys built their castles of gold, people didn't really notice. His elaborate and sometimes grandiose schemes to recapitalise the NHS, change the welfare system and end child poverty in Africa were the strident assertions of a politician who wanted politics to count.</p> <p>And now, at last, it does. The Tories may have had a spring in their step last month. Brown has a wintry, determined stride instead. Yet he could still mess things up. If his great plan fails and the economy plunges into depression, with huge levels of public borrowing and emergency tax rises needed, he could find his reputation crumbling once more.</p> <p>There is not much he can do about that, except forge ahead to try to fix the immediate crisis. But in smaller matters there is a lot more to do. One senior Labour figure puts it like this. At the time of the last Great Depression, during an earlier US presidential contest, there was little concrete to choose between the policies of Hoover and those of Roosevelt. But FDR hit the mood of the country better, triumphed, and is remembered in history. Right now, Barack Obama seems to be achieving something similar.</p> <p>He is managing to stand so tall, he almost seems above party politics. Here, even as David Cameron is failing to find his new voice and tone, Brown has not yet spoken to the country as he ought to. He needs to speak plainly about the hardships and choices ahead. But he also needs to offer hope and explain clearly his plan for getting out of this mess. There was never a greater need for the right words, well spoken.</p> <p>Next, he has to recalibrate his attitude to the daily cut and thrust of Westminster politics. This is where Mandelson comes in. For all his faults, he used to be able to give Blair and Brown confidence, setting out choices and phrases, and sharpening their performances. Some of that, I'm told, is coming back. Mandelson is of the same generation as Brown, and the prime minister is able to take criticism from him - as he could not from younger politicians who had grown up in his shadow. It nearly wasn't Mandelson. There was serious talk about putting Alastair Campbell into the Lords with a government job instead. Anyway, Brown now has the support he needs.</p> <p>So, how will this manifest itself? One early test will come on the 42-day detention issue. It is clearly going to be defeated in the Lords later today. What will Brown do then? Lord Falconer, who was so involved as lord chancellor, and who originally supported Tony Blair's defeated plan for 90-day detention limits, offers an interesting perspective. He's now against 42 days. Why? Because after the 90-day vote, the authorities discovered a loophole.</p> <p>Normally, before someone is charged, the police have to show evidence that there is a 51% or more likelihood of conviction. But in special cases, such as domestic violence, where they need to get an individual out of circulation, they can charge after asserting an \"honest belief\" that conviction will follow. This loophole is being increasingly used in terrorism cases. So the 42-day issue has become more symbolic than real.</p> <p>The old Brown would have said, in effect - exactly! Egged on by macho advisers, he would have relished bloody conflict to prove his political virility. Use the parliament act. Crush the rebels. Mock the Tories. That's how politics is done, isn't it?</p> <p>Well, no, actually, not any more. The mood has changed. Brown no longer needs to create false battlefields. He has a bigger one that's all too real. The atmosphere is for politicians to get together and sort things out. Look at all the stories about Vince Cable or Blair being drafted into a new government of national unity. There are even senior Tories glancing coquettishly at Labour. You don't have to believe any of this will actually happen to see it's the sort of thing people would quite like.</p> <p>Circumstances such as these mean Brown has to set a new mood, including being clear about which battles are central and worth spending time on, and which are not. If Cameron launches opportunistic cheap shots in the Commons, or if George Osborne leaks initiatives for party political purposes, then Brown should let them be the McCain-mimickers and instead draw his inspiration from Obama. He should rise above it, barely engage with it, and address the national crisis only. Despite his personal crises, and his past as a ferocious partisan, I have a shrewd idea that Mandelson understands all this very well.</p> <p>It's all about confidence, isn't it? Brown started as a big figure, then began to shrivel as it seemed that his choices, on election timing and tax, were driven by personal and party advantage. Like many people, I despaired: I'd seen a bigger Brown. In the past year he seemed dithery, almost lost. If this crisis, and the support of old stagers like Mandelson, can restore the old confidence then maybe Brown can rise fully to the occasion. In which case, everything becomes possible. There is already talk of a \"Falklands\" election - a quick poll if Brown manages to sort out the financial crisis.</p> <p>Let's be realistic. The economics are unpredictable. Bad news still lies ahead. Labour MPs are still deeply gloomy about their chances. The likeliest outcome remains a Cameron victory. But at last we have a government that knows what it is for.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:jackie.ashley@theguardian.com\">jackie.ashley@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/europe\">Germany, France, Italy and a further 12 European countries</a> last night unveiled a \"comprehensive\" plan for salvaging their banking systems from potential ruin, as panicked European leaders met to try to ward off more financial meltdown before the markets reopen today.</p> <p>An emergency summit in Paris of the 15 countries using the euro single currency was encouraged by Gordon Brown to adopt the rescue plan he launched last week as the template for an increasingly global approach to the financial crisis.</p> <p>Yesterday's summit in Paris followed a frenetic weekend of activity in Washington, in which the IMF, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/worldbank\">World Bank</a>, the G7 club of rich western nations and the broader G20 group, all called for urgent and coordinated action.</p> <p>Dominique Strauss-Kahn, managing director of the IMF, warned that the global financial system was \"on the brink of systemic meltdown\".</p> <p>The IMF's main policy committee issued a statement saying that it \"recognises that the depth and systemic nature of the crisis call for exceptional vigilance, coordination and readiness to take bold action\".</p> <p>President George Bush took the unprecedented step of addressing the meeting of the G20, which includes the G7 and a number of key developing countries such as China, India and Brazil. Earlier, Bush had met with G7 finance ministers over breakfast.</p> <p>The decisions taken in Paris yesterday marked a triumph for Gordon Brown, with Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, and Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, supporting the key points of last Tuesday's British package aimed at tackling the crises of liquidity and solvency in the banking sector and of confidence in the markets.</p> <p>Under a 13-point draft action plan adopted last night, the European Central Bank will intervene in the financial turmoil to boost liquidity; eurozone governments will underwrite bank debt until the end of next year and the same governments will commit to preventing the collapse of \"systematically relevant institutions through appropriate means including recapitalisation\".</p> <p>The three elements - liquidity support, inter-bank lending guarantees and recapitalisation of distressed banks - are the core of last week's Brown plan and look set, with national variations to take account of differing systems, to become the European standard.</p> <p>\"This is an important day for Europe,\" said the prime minister after briefing the first ever eurozone summit and holding talks with Sarkozy and Jean-Claude Trichet, chairman of the European Central Bank. \"I believe there is common ground. Europe is ready to take action and restore trust.\"</p> <p>He emphasised that the government guarantees for inter-bank lending were \"absolutely crucial\" to freeing up the banking paralysis.</p> <p>The French announced they would legislate on similar guarantees this week, while the Merkel government has also drafted emergency laws which are reported to factor in up to \u20ac300bn (\u00a3176bn) for underwriting German banks' debt issuance.\"The most precious asset which we have lost is confidence,\" said Brown. \"It is something we will restore through coordinated intervention ... In the medium term we've got to rebuild the international financial system.\"</p> <p>All eyes will be on the world's financial markets when they open today as investors give their first response to the G7's pledge to prop up collapsing banks.</p> <p>Several key US financial institutions, including JP Morgan and Citigroup, will release their results this week; and Wall Street giant Morgan Stanley is battling to secure an injection of capital from Japanese bank Mitsubishi. Richard Fisher, governor of the Dallas Fed, underlined the growing economic crisis in the US yesterday when he said the world's largest economy faced a prolonged recession.</p>",
  "<p>The collapse in Morgan Stanley's shares late last week has led to a wave of bets being taken on the blue-chip investment bank failing to meet its financial obligations. Investors fear that the bank's debt would return only a fraction of its face value in the event of a bankruptcy filing and are pushing up the cost of insuring its bonds against default.</p> <p>The annual cost of insuring $10m (\u00a35.8m) Morgan Stanley senior bonds against default rose on Friday to $2.8m, up from a price of $1.9m on Thursday. Such an insurance contract, known as a credit default swap (CDS), can now only be purchased in relation to Morgan Stanley when payment is provided upfront \u2014 further indication of the precariousness of the bank's perceived solvency prospects.</p> <p>The 47% jump in the price of credit protection \u2014 mirrored on Friday by a 22% slump in Morgan Stanley's share price \u2014 came as the complex unwinding process for CDSs linked to failed US rival Lehman Brothers provided further cause for concern. </p> <p>The payout price for those financial firms that sold insurance, sometimes called \"protection\", on Lehman credit was set on Friday night at 91.4 cents in the dollar \u2014 much higher than market expectations. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley is not the only big-name institution that is on the critical list in the credit derivatives market. There are now 135 companies where protection can only be bought on payment upfront, according to price data firm Markit. This compares with a previous peak of 67 in March, suggesting the number of large corporations on the brink of collapse has more than doubled.</p> <p>Gavan Nolan of Markit pointed out that 43 of these upfront CDSs were linked to the debt issued by financial firms. \"The difference now is that it is not just the monoline [insurers] in trouble. Venerable names such as Morgan Stanley are trading upfront, as are blue-chip life insurers Prudential and Metlife. And it goes beyond the US. Japanese consumer finance companies Aiful and Takefuji are present, as well as three Kazakhstan banks.\"</p> <p>Firms in the wider economy are also seeing their solvency prospects called into question, particularly cyclical consumer goods firms.</p> <p>The potential for contagion, however, remains greatest among the banks and all eyes are now on Morgan Stanley ahead of the $9bn capital injection it is expected to receive tomorrow from Japan's Mitsubishi UFJ in return for a 20% stake.</p> <p>Some investors and analysts have suggested the US government will want to do everything in its power to avoid a repeat of the confusion and fear that was created by the collapse of Lehman. \"You can't possible allow Morgan Stanley to go. The unrelenting pessimism and absences of confidence that we've seen for the last two weeks would get worse,\" Michael Holland, who oversees more than $4bn of assets at Holland &amp; Co in New York, told Reuters.</p> <p>Banking analysts Sandy Chen at Panmure Gordon has expressed concern the unwinding of Lehman and other CDS trades linked to a rash of corporate collapses could sink several hedge funds and trigger big writedowns for banks that have been active in the derivatives market. In the UK he points to Barclays and Royal Bank of Soctland which have each bought and sold, in roughly equal measure, about $2.4 trillion of credit derivatives.</p> <p>Other analysts such as Michael Hampden-Turner at Citigroup play down such fears. They note CDS contracts are typically covered with collateral on a daily basis so the potential for payment failures should not be significant. </p> <p>Nevertheless, many banks are hoarding cash ahead of an expected swift succession of unwinding credit derivatives the likely outcome of which is unclear. This is in large part because of a lack of transparency in the young and largely unregulated market.</p> <p>There are $128bn of defaulted Lehman senior bonds outstanding, but no one knows the gross sum of related derivatives, with estimates ranging from $200bn to $440bn. The net payout should be a fraction of this figure but is even harder to gauge. Hampden-Turner believes net payouts on Lehman CDSs could be about $10bn but admits the figure is little more than an educated guess.</p> <p>At the end of last year the total gross value of CDSs outstanding world was $54.6 trillion, according to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association. The market, which has never been tested in a global downturn, grew from $5.44 trillion at the end of 2003 to a peak of $62.2 trillion last year. </p> <p>The net value of the market is believed to be a great deal lower than these figures because it is common practice for investors to write a protection contract on a credit and then later to buy an identical contract on the same credit. The net effect is that the financial exposure is cancelled out, but the notional value of CDS contracts is doubled. The Federal Reserve and the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission are working hard with the credit derivatives industry to improve transparency.</p>",
  "<p>Banks will be forced to accept lower levels of profit as controls on their debt-fuelled expansion are tightened up to prevent a re-run of the current crisis, the international body responsible for global financial stability has warned.</p> <p>Mario Draghi, the chairman of the Financial Stability Forum (FSF), said that in the new post-credit crunch world, banks would have to carry less debt and have higher capital reserves in order to prevent the \"perverse incentives\" that were at the root of the bank collapses across the globe.</p> <p>\"It's what everybody now understands,\" Draghi said in Washington. \"It seems easy, it seems simple, but somehow it's a very difficult concept to put in people's heads, for one reason: profits are going to be lower in the financial services industry in the future.\"</p> <p>The FSF, which includes central bankers and financial regulators, said that since the fire sale of Bear Stearns in March, \"strains in the financial system have deepened to unprecedented levels, necessitating extraordinary emergency measures\".</p> <p>In a report presented to G7 finance ministers at the International Monetary Fund in Washington this weekend, the FSF said work was already underway on a comprehensive reform package designed to tighten accounting standards; force banks to reveal their exposure to complex derivatives trades; and prevent excessive lending in boom times.</p> <p>Draghi said there was a close link between the lack of transparency and the recent run on bank shares. \"When the market doesn't know what's in the balance sheets, it is bound to ask for more capital.\"</p> <p>He said that the previous rules of the financial market had encouraged an explosion of off balance sheet vehicles, because banks were not required to hold capital against them. When the crisis began, however, financial institutions had been forced to take responsibility for these arms-length assets.</p> <p>Draghi urged governments to work closely together in tackling the crisis, warning that if one country offers weaker financial support for its banks and their savers than another, there was a risk that speculators would move in to attack institutions.</p> <p>Draghi said that it would be impossible to repair the damage to the financial system overnight. \"Credit markets have dried up everywhere. Liquidity has been drying up for many months. We don't have a silver bullet to change this in a minute.\"</p> <p>The FSF said it would closely monitor the global response to the crisis, and would seek to ensure that emergency plans produced by individual countries were consistent with each other. It added that it wanted to mitigate the \"pro-cyclicality\" in the financial system, a trend that encourages banks to lend excessively in good times, but to rein in credit when it is most needed.</p> <p>It will insist that banks hold more capital, take a more cautious view of possible losses, and reform pay structures that reward risky decisions.</p> <p>Draghi said that while much of the FSF's work was for the medium and longer term, there were two reforms that would help alleviate the current crisis. </p> <p>He called for a central body to be set up, to act as a hub for the market for so-called \"over-the-counter credit derivatives\", the complex bets between investors. Draghi said that the current system left individual institutions dangerously exposed to losses, and a centralised system would reduce the systemic risk.</p> <p>The second reform was for better accounting standards, so that off balance sheet activities were disclosed and open to valuation. </p> <p>Credit agencies also came under criticism from the FSF, which called on them to come up with better rules for assessing the risk from products such as mortgage-backed securities, losses on which have been at the heart of the credit crunch.</p> <h2>Sign up now for Guardian event, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/thedebtdebate\">The Debt Debate</a>, an in-depth look at financial education and advice</h2>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/gordonbrown\">Gordon Brown</a> was today holding key talks with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/europe\">European</a> officials desperate to prevent a continent-wide meltdown in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/banking\">banking sector</a> when the markets reopen tomorrow.</p> <p>The prime minister, who has travelled to Paris for the negotiations, wants the rest of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/eu\">EU</a> to adopt a plan along the lines of his \u00a3500bn banking system bail-out, announced last week. </p> <p>But he now believes the government could end up having to take seats on the boards of rescued banks to keep control of bosses' pay and bonuses.</p> <p>Brown said the next few days would be critical as the world tried to drag itself back from the financial brink after Friday's stock market panic wiped \u00a32.7 trillion off global share values.</p> <p>\"The decisions that we take now will not just affect what happens in the next week or two but what happens in the next year or two,\" he told the Observer. </p> <p>He was backed by the International Monetary Fund chief, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who warned that the world was looking at a \"systemic financial meltdown\" if countries did not push through coordinated action to ease the current crisis.</p> <p>World leaders are keen to see major economies adopt similar plans to re-capitalise banks and guarantee interbank lending for fear that panic selling in the stock market will move to those countries with the weakest banks. </p> <p>While Brown wants the rest of the EU to follow Britain's lead in offering to recapitalise stricken banks and provide funding and state guarantees for their money market operations, not all eurozone leaders are enthusiastic.</p> <p>Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, has already shown that she is set against a common eurozone plan because she does not want Germany, as the zone's biggest economy, to have to pay the lion's share of it. </p> <p>Merkel is due to unveil her own plan for capital injections into German banks today, and a government guarantee of savings and lending between banks that could cost as much as \u20ac400bn.</p> <p>Italy is negotiating a similar plan, although France has proved less concerned about its own banks. </p> <p>The Financial Stability Forum, in Washington, has forecast a future for banks as one of more capital, less risk and lower profits as a result of much tighter regulation. </p> <p>The prediction came as the UK continued to thrash out details of its own bail-out plan with bank leaders today.</p> <p>The Treasury is believed to be looking at taking stakes in Britain's leading banks, giving it more control over their business and even representation on boards.</p> <p>Last week, Treasury officials made \u00a325bn of public money available for the country's eight largest banks and another \u00a325bn in reserve in case other banks needed more.</p> <p>But the indications today were that the biggest four banks would now require \u00a335bn alone, such is the battered state of their balance sheets after the recent weeks of turmoil in the markets. </p> <p>Halifax Bank of Scotland and the Royal Bank of Scotland are likely to take the majority of that money, with the government becoming the majority shareholder in both.</p> <p>If that is the case, the liabilities of both banks will almost certainly have to appear on the public finances, pushing the national debt hugely higher in the same way Northern Rock did.</p> <p>Yesterday, Treasury officials said they had held constructive talks with their counterparts in the Icelandic capital, Reykjavik, over British deposits held in the collapsed Icesave bank. </p> <p>They said the Icelanic government had agreed in principle to accelerate payouts to retail depositors. </p> <p>The Liberal Democrat leader, Nick Clegg, today called for tax cuts to help hard-pressed families through the financial crisis. </p> <p>\"It's time for the government to help the millions of struggling families, not just the banks,\" he said. \"Low and middle-income families need tax cuts now to help them through the recession. </p> <p>\"These could be funded by simple measures to crack down on tax avoidance and by making the system fairer.\"</p>",
  "<p>The global financial crisis may be grabbing all the headlines, but resolving it should not be allowed to crowd out other vital issues. In the Middle East, for instance, Israelis and Palestinians \u2013 as well as many others around the world \u2013 are beginning to believe that the negotiations to determine the long-term status of Palestine are going nowhere. </p> <p>The situation may be more promising than it appears, but one cannot deny that hope for real changes on the ground has faded since talks were relaunched two years ago. This loss of faith is, sadly, establishing a dynamic that will itself inhibit the concessions that are needed if a permanent agreement is to be found. </p> <p>Because an impasse beckons, it is vitally important to work on those areas in which intensive negotiations have the potential to produce quick results. Fresh water is one such area. </p> <p>Across the Middle East, <a href=\"http://www.unesco.org/water/\">water is a security issue</a>. Indeed, people are now recognising two important facts. First, nations faced with conflicting claims to water have historically found ways to collaborate rather than to fight. Even during the 60 years of conflict in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_River\"> the Jordan Valley</a>, water has more often been a source of cooperation than of conflict. </p> <p>Second, water scarcity is seldom absolute, and even less often an explanation of poverty. To quote the United Nations Human Development Report for 2006: \"There is more than enough water in the world for domestic purposes, for agriculture and for industry \u2026Scarcity is manufactured through political processes and institutions that disadvantage the poor.\"</p> <p>But almost every nation in the Middle East is using more water than arrives on a renewable basis. There simply is not enough water for everything these nations want to use it for, and the situation will only worsen. Yet, even in Palestine, the crucial water issue is not thirst, but arrested economic development. In the short term, Palestine needs more water to provide employment and income from farming; in the longer term, educational, cultural, and political changes are needed in order to develop a capacity to adapt. </p> <p>The region's climate and geography mean that water resources are unavoidably shared. But only if water is shared in a rational manner that respects the region's fragile ecology will human life be sustainable. </p> <p>Clearly, no final agreement on water will be possible until there are agreed-upon borders between the state of Israel and the state of Palestine (assuming a two-state solution), and some resolution of the Israeli settlements in the West Bank. But any interim resolution of water issues does not need to wait for final resolution of the major questions of territory. Finding rational ways to share and co-manage water may be easier than solving the \"big\" issues. In fact, water could help to create a climate of success that aids political progress in other areas. </p> <p>The good news is that the quantity of water that is needed for drinking, cooking, other household chores and sanitation is small. Most water is used to grow food, so, if a nation's economy is healthy, there is scope for saving water by importing a greater share of food, although every nation will want to maintain some assured food supply for security reasons. </p> <p>The bad news is that water, unlike land, cannot simply be divided. Water flows on the surface and underground. As it moves, it changes in quantity and quality, and it supports different ecosystems. Moreover, demand for water changes over time. Only a few percentage points of the Israeli GNP come from agriculture today; as a result, its economy requires less water than it once did. Exactly the same transition is likely to occur in Palestine, but it has not happened yet. </p> <p>Few Israelis deny that Palestinians need more water. Similarly, there is wide agreement that some water currently used by Israelis will have to be allocated to Palestinian use. The current negotiations will inevitably deal with rights to water, which do not seem to be very contentious any more, and the talks can suggest various mechanisms for transfer of management in some cases and for shared management in others. </p> <p>These are eminently negotiable issues. A flexible and sustainable formula can certainly be found, almost surely including a transitional period that allows both sides to adjust to and account for their different water management systems, as well as for changing conditions and institutions in the future. The principle of a just division of water resources to meet the Palestinians' urgent needs for additional water should be taken as a starting point. Everything else can be worked out. </p> <p>Shared water calls for flexible, continuous, cooperative water management, based on agreed-upon rights and responsibilities, as well as continuing monitoring and dispute resolution mechanisms. One important point should be added: extensive public participation and transparency, in terms of both process and outcomes, will be key to successful management. </p> <p>We believe that progress in the peace process and in finding solutions for water issues between Israel and Palestine would also help to unblock progress in the broader region, between the parties on the Jordan, the Orontes, the Tigris, and the Euphrates rivers. Water can be a catalyst for regional cooperation, opening the way to a future comprehensive community of water and energy to enhance the human environment. In such a forum, water and solar energy in tandem could help to move the Middle East from conflict to collaboration. </p> <p>The cost of inaction or merely pretending to act is likely to be high for everyone in the Middle East. Future water policy should no longer be seen as an extension of current policy, but rather as a new opportunity. Water is the essence of life. People in Palestine and in Israel need it; people in the region need it. Cooperating to secure it is the only way forward. </p> <p><em>V\u00e1clav Havel is former president of the Czech Republic; Andr\u00e9 Glucksmann is a French philosopher; Frederik Willem de Klerk is a former president of South Africa; Mike Moore is a former director general of the World Trade Organisation; Yohei Sasakawa is a Japanese philanthropist; Karel Schwarzenberg is foreign minister of the Czech Republic; George Soros is a financier; El Hassan bin Talal is a Prince of Jordan; Desmond Mpilo Tutu is a Nobel Peace Prize laureate; Richard von Weizs\u00e4cker is a former president of Germany; Grigori Yavlinsky is a Russian politician. </em></p> <p><em>Copyright: Project Syndicate, 2008. <br><a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org\">www.project-syndicate.org</a></em></p>",

There are certainly signs in certain areas hard hit by the housing crisis, but life goes on. Cars still clog the freeways. People are still out at restaurants and shops, especially in the luxury shopping districts. But what started in housing market is cascading through the economy. Unemployment has jumped in the last year, threatening a downward spiral of job losses.</p> <p>The global financial crisis started with sub-prime home loans in the United States, and Orange County California was a major centre for sub-prime lenders. The bankruptcy of New Century Financial was one of the early signs of the meltdown. The housing crisis in the US was the first event in a global financial crisis, and the fallout from the these crises is hitting the southern California hard, said Mark Lacter, who writes a <a href=\"http://www.laobserved.com/biz/\">business blog for LAObserved.com</a>.</p> <p>New Century may have been the first subprime company to fail, but it's not the only bank or lender to fail here in southern California. Countrywide, under investigation by the state and also the US government, was based in <a href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=calabasas+california&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;ll=34.177725,-118.510895&amp;spn=0.563515,1.235962&amp;z=10&amp;iwloc=addr\">Calabasas</a> north of Malibu. Countrywide was the largest mortgage lender in the United States. In January, the failing <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=18028482\">mortgage giant was bought by Bank of America for $4bn</a>, which now will have to deal with the legal fallout of Countrywide's collapse, not to mention the financial fallout.</p> <p>The collapse in housing housing prices has not hit all areas of the US or <a href=\"http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/NA-AS985_SALVAG_NS_20081006184015.gif\">even of southern California with the same destructive force</a>. In a bid to build affordable housing, there was a building boom east of LA in Riverside, San Bernadino and in the Antelope Valley area in communities such as Lancaster and Palmdale. \"It was just too expensive here in Los Angeles,\" he said.</p> <p>\"These developments sprung up, and along with the sales activity came the low interest rates and all these come-ons for loans that were crazy,\" he said. After the bubble burst, these communities have faced waves of foreclosures. \"This has been going on for a number of months, and it will probably continue to be a problem through the end of 2009.\"</p> <p><strong>The economy takes a hit</strong></p> <p>There are so many houses available that new construction has come to a halt. In many of these hard hit communities, homes are selling, but <a href=\"http://www.dqnews.com/News/California/CA-Foreclosures/RRFor080722.aspx\">40% of sales are foreclosed homes</a>. With no new homes being build, the construction business has been hit hard. A year ago, unemployment in LA County was about 5%. Unemployment in August in Los Angeles County was 7.9%, Mark said. The state jobless rate is 7.7%, but in hard hit areas in the I<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inland_Empire_(California)\">nland Empire east of LA,</a> the <a href=\"http://www.pe.com/localnews/inland/stories/PE_News_Local_S_inlandfed09.45ec769.html\">jobless figure jumps to 9.2%.</a> It's not just construction but manufacturing, financial services and the huge ports in the area have all been hit. \"To see a jump like that is really extraordinary,\" Mark said.</p> <p>Signs of the declining economy are now clear. Huge volumes of international trade flow through the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. As consumer spending in the US drops off, retailers don't order as much. The shipments into the ports is down. The drop in consumer spending is expected to continue through the end of the year. \"People are just not shopping at malls like they used or going out to eat,\" he said.</p> <p>\"All of this starts to impact the real economy in ways we probably didn't see a year and a half to two years ago,\" he said.</p> <p>With stock markets in free fall this week, economists aren't ready to predict where the bottom is. \"Maybe by the end of 2009, we'll reach that point. No on really knows,\" Mark said, but most people believe when we hit the bottom, the recovery won't be immediate. \"We'll probably be at that bottom level for quite a while before it makes an upward turn.\"</p> <p>In terms of the California real estate market, it will take a long time, possibly up to decade if the last real estate recession in southern California in the 1990s is any indication. \"It was a very, very long process,\" he said.</p> <p>The state is trying to <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122334317101810201.html\">prevent a repeat of the 1990s</a> when investors bought up large amounts of real-estate at 'fire-sale' prices in the <a href=\"http://www.fdic.gov/bank/historical/s&amp;l/index.html\">wake of the savings and loan crisis</a>, the last major financial meltdown in US.</p> <blockquote> <p>In some cases, entire neighborhoods of what had once been homeowners turned into largely rental communities, further depressing property values and delaying an economic rebound.</p> </blockquote> <p>California officials want to allow local governments and businesses with ties to the local community to buy some of the properties.</p> <p>What is clear is that California is looking at a pretty \"substantial\" recession, Mark said, but he added that southern California is a huge, diversified economy. The economy is based on international trade, financial services and Hollywood. Hollywood is still attracting investment from all over the world. Indian media conglomerate Reliance ADA has just made a <a href=\"http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/southasia/news/article_1435154.php/DreamWorks_seals_Paramount_split_to_allow_Indian_investment_\">major investment in Dreamworks</a>.</p> <p><strong>Will the bailout help?</strong></p> <p>The big question is whether the recently passed US government bailout will help. Voters are outraged, and even the business community is sceptical that that bailout will help the housing market or the economy, especially in the short term. </p> <p>Mark shares this scepticism. \"From a political standpoint, there has been a lot of noise about helping these borrowers who took on these very bad loans and are now stuck,\" he said. In many cases, even if the loans were modified, many people who bought homes as the bubble grew would probably re-default on their loans in a year or two, he added. He's not sure what this accomplishes other than making the government appear to be doing something.</p> <p>There are some borrowers were suckered into these loans, and they might be able to pay them off with a little help, Mark said.</p> <p>\"But in so many cases, folks 'bought' these houses, but they really acted as renters,\" he added. \"They didn't put any down payment down, and their monthly payments were pretty minimal. There is a real question as to whether these folks should have been homeowners in the first place,\" he said. Congress hasn't paid enough attention to this mostly because it's \"politically incorrect\", he said.</p> <p>Politically, the crisis has definitely helped the Democrats, but Mark said, \"whoever wins will be faced with an amazingly difficult task to work all of this out.\" The frozen credit markets need to be thawed first to prevent the economy from locking up, and the next president will be faced with dealing with a national debt as well as a huge consumer debt load.</p> <p>The frozen credit markets will make it even more difficult for the housing market to rebound. \"The irony of it is that the banks that were basically giving away loans that led up to this crisis. Now, they are giving you such a hassle in terms of documentation, income and taxes. Suddenly, they are paying very close attention when a few years ago, they didn't care about any of this stuff,\" Mark said.</p> <p>Technorati Tags: <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/politics\" rel=\"tag\" class=\"techtag\">politics</a> <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/US\" rel=\"tag\" class=\"techtag\">US</a> <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/elections\" rel=\"tag\" class=\"techtag\">elections</a> <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/economy\" rel=\"tag\" class=\"techtag\">economy</a> <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/California\" rel=\"tag\" class=\"techtag\">California</a></p>"
