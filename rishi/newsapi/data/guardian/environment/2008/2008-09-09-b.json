  "<p>Manchester United's arrival at Anfield on Saturday for Liverpool's first match since the club's owners, Tom Hicks and George Gillett, failed to raise the money for a proposed new stadium, could almost have been timed deliberately to hammer home Liverpool fans' crushing disappointment with the North American duo.</p> <p>It was United's dominance of English football in the mid-1990s - eclipsing Liverpool, relentlessly expanding Old Trafford and wringing every last penny out of it - that drove Liverpool into their agitated search for a new and larger stadium. The only reason Liverpool were put up for sale was to find \"investors\" who would build the new stadium on Stanley Park, thereby pushing Liverpool's earnings somewhere near a level at which they would be able to compete with United. David Moores, the club's chairman and major shareholder, ultimately favoured the Americans over the rival billions of Dubai International Capital partly because Hicks and Gillett were more positive about their ability to get the stadium built.</p> <p>In their formal offer to take over the club, Hicks and Gillett wrote to all shareholders that they had: \"Indicated [their] intention to take forward the Stanley Park development ... and to commence building one of the leading stadia in Europe as soon as is reasonably practicable.\"</p> <p>The offer document also made it clear that Hicks and Gillett had borrowed the \u00a3185m necessary to buy the club, and another \u00a3113m to pay off its debts and fund player signings. Instead of moving quickly to raise money for the stadium, last January the co-owners were refinancing those initial loans, taking out a \u00a3350m credit facility with Royal Bank of Scotland. RBS now has a mortgage over Anfield, the Melwood training ground and every lock, stock and barrel owned by Liverpool Football Club. That \u00a3350m has been borrowed just until this coming January, with the option to extend it only as far as next July.</p> <p>Sceptics argued that Hicks and Gillett, having brought so much debt to the club, rather than investment, would struggle to borrow another \u00a3400m to fund the stadium, but Hicks denies that the club's indebtedness was a factor in the failure to do so this year. Instead, in a cursory statement last month, Liverpool blamed the credit crunch, saying \"the building of the new stadium will be subject to delay\" due to \"global market conditions\".</p> <p>No further explanation has been forthcoming from Hicks, other than that all large projects are affected by banks' current reluctance to lend. The revised aim is for Liverpool to kick off in the new stadium a year later than planned, for the start of the 2012-13 season. Even if that does happen, putting Liverpool \u00a3750m in debt, by then United will have had four more seasons at their 76,000-capacity Old Trafford home; Arsenal will have had the same time at their lucrative new Emirates Stadium; and Chelsea will have had four more seasons enjoying the fruits of Roman Abramovich's largesse. Furthermore, Sheikh Mansour of Abu Dhabi is now threatening to make Manchester City into nouveaux riches contenders for a top-four Premier League finish.</p> <p>If Liverpool were to be knocked out of the qualification places for the Champions League, which earned them \u00a321.6m last season, their long tenancy of English football's first rank could be lost.</p> <p>Yet there is more to Hicks' and Gillett's failure to finance the new stadium than the challenge to Liverpool's footballing status. The new stadium on Stanley Park and plans to develop the current Anfield site into a hive of restaurants, shops and offices are central to plans to regenerate the area around the old ground, which, over the years, has declined into near-devastation.</p> <p>Anfield could currently lay claim to being the most economically unequal place in Great Britain. Around the Premier League club's famous ground are rows of shattered streets whose houses have stood empty and boarded up for years. Like many areas in formerly industrial towns and cities, particularly in the north-west, old jobs disappeared in the 1980s and people moved away. Houses, if they were occupied at all, were let short term to people who had no stake in the area. The terraced streets of Anfield and neighbouring Breckfield were blighted by crime and many houses were burnt out before being sealed with grimly familiar metal shuttering, a process known locally as being \"tinned up\".</p> <p>The area around Venmore Street, opposite the stadium, is, according to the Index of Multiple Deprivation, the most deprived local authority ward in Britain. Crowds of fans walk past its boarded-up terraces on matchdays and it is difficult to imagine that Liverpool's Spanish striker Fernando Torres, the very definition of a European golden boy, can be parading his multimillion-pound skills just over the stadium wall.</p> <p>The football club's role in this neighbourhood's decline and planned resurrection has been a long-running issue. Many residents bitterly resented the club, a decade ago, for buying up houses on Skerries Road, next to Anfield, and leaving them empty in case the club ever wanted to knock the row down and expand the stadium. Then, in 2000, there was uproar about leaked plans worked up by Liverpool and the city council, without consultation, to build a new stadium and, in the process, demolish 1,800 houses.</p> <p>That prompted a change at the club, towards a closer relationship with the community, and the current plans for Stanley Park followed extensive consultation with groups of residents who retain a defiant pride in the area.</p> <p>A group remains opposed to building on the park, but planning permission was granted largely because the project is intended to regenerate this blighted district. The new stadium was conceived not only as a landmark move for the world-famous club, but as a statement of confidence in the city's future. The development of the old stadium site, to be renamed Anfield Plaza, is designed to bring in 900 jobs.</p> <p>\"Anfield Plaza is central to the area's economic revival,\" explains John Kelly, Liverpool city council's executive director for regeneration. \"We are very disappointed that the project has been delayed. The local people, in one of the most deprived areas of the country, have been waiting a long time.\"</p> <p>While the club stagnates, the council and local organisations have been getting on with things. Improvements to Stanley Park are going ahead, helped by \u00a316m in grants. New housing has been built, or houses improved - including on Skerries Road, which was taken on by a development company and now looks very spruce. The football club lost a \u00a35m European Union grant to build the required community centre in the new stadium because they ran out of time; the money has been allocated instead to improving four local facilities.</p> <p>However, people are still living around bleak streets, with hundreds of houses awaiting demolition, amid poverty which is shaming.</p> <p>\"A lot of work is going on,\" says Marie Rooney, a long-term activist and chair of the local Anfield and Breckside Community Council. \"But the stadium was supposed to be a catalyst, and jobs created, which hasn't happened. I've lost confidence. A lot of people have, because we have been waiting so long. It's an embarrassment now. The Americans seem to want to do it without spending their own money, but I have lost confidence in whether they have the ability to deliver.\"</p> <p>Hicks and Gillett say they still have that ability, with borrowed money, but starting next year.</p>",
  "<p>The immigration proposals outlined by Frank Field and Nicholas Soames (Labour MPs immigration plan brings claims of xenophobia, September 8), if implemented, would place an unacceptably high burden on UK firms and damage our economy. There are several problems. First, forcing employers to advertise jobs across Europe, as well as locally, would cost companies considerable amounts of time and money. Second, they cannot assume businesses will be happy to take on more policing duties of their new system because again, this would add to their already considerable regulatory burden. Third, setting a strict limit on the number of people allowed to settle permanently in the UK after their initial work permit expires will simply put off many talented workers from choosing this country in the first place. Immigration adds billions to our economy every year and quotas are not the answer for a country looking to compete in a global market for talent.<strong><br>Colin Stanbridge</strong><br>Chief executive, London Chamber of Commerce and Industry </p> <p>The all-party balanced migration group's report argues that Britain may need to build \"seven new Birminghams\" to accommodate new migrants. Yet Birmingham has benefited massively from migration. Fuelling hysteria over migration simply won't address the challenges we face as cities like Birmingham and Leicester become ever-more diverse. The group's central tenet - that non-EU migrants should have to return home after four years of residency in the UK - ignores numerous push-and-pull factors involved in a migrant's decision on whether to stay in the UK. It also fails to acknowledge the positive financial and cultural impact such migrants have on Britain.<br><strong>Sukhvinder Kaur-Stubbs</strong><br>Chief executive, Barrow Cadbury Trust </p> <p>Immigration policy has long been in need of reform and the present rate is clearly unsustainable. Many citizens - even leftwingers - wish to see much less of it to our already crowded isle. The negatives are clear: we don't have the housing, there are clear strains on public services, the low paid are squeezed etc. It is crucial to put the resources needed into upgrading the educational and life skills of the large minority of our young people whose lives are defined by hopelessness. It is also crucial to put the resources needed into retraining older people. </p> <p>In future the government needs to use EU transition rules over the permitted seven years to stop a repeat of the huge numbers of migrants from accession countries which we saw in 2004. These people are not refugees and their skills are needed by their own countries. I would suggest aiming not for balancing the ins and outs, but substantially reducing inward immigration. <br><strong>Freya Coxley</strong><br>Falmouth, Cornwall</p>",
  "<p>According to your article (Report, September 4), Foreign Office officials reportedly refused to confirm the fact that Russia was repeatedly warning the British partners about the approaching crisis in and around South Ossetia, with no meaningful reply.

  "<p>This year has seen millions of people face drought in Ethiopia, 11 million people affected by flooding in India, and up to 128,000 people killed by the cyclone that struck Burma. Scientists predict that such weather events will only become more frequent and more extreme as a result of climate change. </p> <p>In December last year, I visited Bangladesh and met people who had lost their homes, their possessions and, in many cases, their loved ones in Cyclone Sidr. I was humbled and inspired by the courage and solidarity they showed in the face of such devastation. </p> <p>A woman named Lotifa told me how her family home and all that was in it had been destroyed by the cyclone. We spoke at the ramshackle lean-to made of corrugated iron that she and her two young children now called home. Yet the little that her family had - the basic shelter, and the relief parcels with blankets, cooking pots and soap - they shared with her friend, Hafisa, and her two children. </p> <p>At a centre run by Save the Children, I met a five-year-old girl, Topo, who lost both her parents in the cyclone. She told me not of the hardships she faced but of her hopes and dreams to become a dancer when she is older. </p> <p>Today, the UK and Bangladesh governments are coming together in London to examine the steps that must be taken to help people better prepare for extreme weather, and to tackle the climate change that will make cyclones, droughts and floods more frequent and more devastating. </p> <p>Environmentalists coined the phrase \"think global, act local\". In responding to climate change, we need to act both locally and globally. British aid is helping the people of Bangladesh to adapt to changing weather patterns: helping farmers to turn to fishing; raising homes on plinths in flood-prone areas; and creating floating gardens to protect crops. </p> <p>We are also helping the government of Bangladesh to prepare for the worst; indeed, when Cyclone Sidr struck, some 40,000 volunteers with megaphones and bicycles helped to get more than 3 million people out of harm's way. </p> <p>The people of Bangladesh may be on the frontline of climate change, yet they cannot battle against the rising tides alone. We need to reach a fair and ambitious deal at the UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen next year that includes a long-term goal to stabilise greenhouse gases at a level that will avoid dangerous climate change. The G8 meeting in Japan in July laid the groundwork for such an agreement, with leaders committing to a cut in emissions of at least 50%. </p> <p>The world now has a duty to rise to the challenge and ensure that we support the poorest people of the world - who are the least responsible for climate change - to prevent and prepare for its cruellest consequences. </p> <p>It is often said that we must act to tackle climate change out of an obligation to future generations. I believe we have an obligation to our own generation.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Douglas Alexander is the secretary of state for international development.</p>",
  "<h2>Life of your drive</h2> <p>Oxford Brookes University is setting up what it calls \"a sustainable vehicle centre\", which it says will deal with \"the current and future challenges facing the whole lifecycle of motor vehicles ... and its impact on the environment\". Hmm. Eco Soundings wonders whether it will be opened by Jeremy Clarkson, who was awarded an honorary degree by Oxford Brookes in 2005 for services rendered to the auto industry, and whose love of the environment is legendary. Clarkson's TV show, Top Gear, has just been rapped by the BBC standards committee for showing the great man drinking while driving at the wheel on the way to the magnetic North Pole. The show's producers defended the footage, saying: \"They weren't shown to be not in control of the car.\" </p> <h2>Panel beating</h2> <p>What exactly was the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) doing when it came out last week with a study alleging that \"payback\" periods for solar thermal and solar photovoltaic (PV) could take 100 years or more. \"Misleading, inaccurate, and out of date,\" screamed PV company Solarcentury, which was backed by Sharp, the Japanese firm that has a large PV factory in Wrexham, north Wales, and is run off its feet making panels for the world. \"RICS' conclusions are a mixture of historic pricing information and the very crudest 'payback' calculations which bear no resemblance to reality,\" says Jeremy Leggett, executive chair of Solarcentury. Minimal research by Eco Soundings suggests that solar installers are offering retrofit PV systems with a \"payback\" of 13 years. </p> <h2>Hailing distance</h2> <p>An email comes from Kenya: \"For the first time in our history, a hailstorm hit an area around the Aberdare Range, near Nyahururu town, yesterday, leaving 10 inches thick of ice spread over an area of 200 hectares. The villagers were left in shock. We need to arm ourselves in advance. Send over winter clothes urgently. My heart got heavy to see a cow walking on snow with a lot of difficulties. This ogre we have labelled climate change is a real agony!!!\"</p> <h2>Making waives</h2> <p>National and international environment groups have sided with EU trade commissioner Peter Mandelson and the UK government over the toxic French aircraft carrier Clemenceau, which is due to arrive on Teesside to be scrapped, with 700 tonnes of asbestos aboard. The people of Hartlepool say the town is in danger of becoming the toxic capital of Europe, with local company Able UK specialising in scrapping \"dirty\" ships. The feisty Friends of Hartlepool group has signed up environmental law firm Public Interest Lawyers to challenge the government's Health and Safety Executive for waiving the asbestos importing rules to allow the Clemenceau in. The case will hinge on how much the executive took into account French union protestations that there are firms in France eager and able to scrap the ship that India and other developing countries said was too toxic for them.</p>",

  "<p>The universe is increasingly incomprehensible, don't you find? Consider that small part of it taken up by James Bond films. For decades they were satisfyingly stupid, making numbskulls such as me feel a glow of superiority. No one, with all due respect, has ever been intellectually challenged by Roger Moore. Not even me. Now, though, I can't even understand the title of the next 007 film. What does Quantum of Solace really mean? Is solace something that can be quantified? Or did Ian Fleming just throw words together, like an irresponsible God drunk with power on the eve of creation, hoping they would add up to something?</p> <p>And if I can't understand Bond film titles, then what chance have I got of understanding what is going to happen in a 27km (17-mile) circular tunnel beneath the Geneva countryside this morning at the start of an experiment that, it has been suggested, will unlock the secrets of the universe? Despite the obvious answer to this question (ie: \"None\"), I am going on a crash course to try to find out what it all means, armed only with a misplaced assurance that I am not the thickest thing in the universe.</p> <p>What, I want to know, do half the world's particle physicists hope to achieve by triggering a machine called a Large Hadron Collider (LHC) to drive two beams of particles in opposite directions around this 27km ring at 99.9999991% of the speed of light, steering the beams at four points during their circuit into head-on collisions with enough energy to recreate in miniature the cosmic circumstances that existed one trillionth of a second after the big bang? </p> <p>Everything conspires against understanding. The European Organisation for Nuclear Research is confusingly known by its French acronym Cern, for instance. But that's nothing. Cern's scientists also hope to find extra dimensions, perhaps as many as 10, coiled up in microscopic loops. (I look back on that last sentence wondering what the hell it means.) They hope to create called a Higgs boson, which is a particle that hasn't existed since a split-second after the big bang and yet which, physicists hypothesise, was fundamental, billions of years ago, for the establishing the nature of reality. A Nobel prize-winner called the Higgs boson \"the God particle\", but every expert I speak to says that this term has no theological import, but is a silly, misleading piece of nomenclature. So thank you, Nobel laureate Leon M Lederman, for muddying further already murky waters. </p> <p>Discombobulatingly, I read that only 5% of the universe is made of matter that scientists understand. A further 25% is so-called \"dark matter\", which clusters around galaxies, and the remaining 70% is even more enigmatic \"dark energy\", which drives the expansion of the universe. Or so scientists claim. But hold on: if scientists only understand 5%, how can they posit anything about the remaining 95%? Aren't they, then, only slightly less ignorant than me? Won't you let me hold on to that dream? Please? </p> <p>Worse yet, the basic building blocks of the universe seemed to have been named by astrophysics postgrads on crack, or at least a dare. I'm familiar with quark, strangeness and charm, though only because this was the title of a Hawkwind album. I'd never come across a gluon before, though. Although it has an unwonted DIY vibe, like something you might use to hold your bookcase together if you'd lost the Allen key, a gluon turns out to be an elementary particle that causes quarks to interact, and is indirectly responsible for the binding of protons and neutrons together in atomic nuclei. What's more, your everyday gluon has something called negative intrinsic parity and zero isospin. It is, you will be astounded to learn, its own antiparticle. Again, I write these last three sentences and look back at them in bafflement. Oh God, this is hopeless! The only graspable part of particle physics for me is to be found in John Updike's poem Cosmic Gall: \"Neutrinos, they are very small/ And do not interact at all.\" I understand that bit. The poor little sweethearts!</p> <p>I ring the astronomer royal, Professor Martin Rees, for help. \"I believe that the key ideas can be explained by people who need to make a bit of effort to communicate at the right pitch and to people who, similarly, need to think harder than usual,\" he says. \" There is a special scientific vocabulary which is unfamiliar and the mathematics is very complicated, but learning about the experiment is like learning musical notation or like learning Spanish.\"</p> <p>Heartened by these words (even though I barely read music or speak Spanish), I settle down for a pub chat with people who have never aspired to unlock the mysteries of the universe. After exhaustively analysing today's other important global event (how will England avoid humiliation in Zagreb this evening?), we reflect on sub-atomic activity. At the Old Queen's Head on the Essex Road in Islington, north London, the conversation starts shallow before plunging deeper. Barry asks me the following: \"Did you see Frankie Boyle on Mock the Week?\" Perhaps I did. \"He said: 'I'm sure they're going to find out some interesting things about protons, but I would add: I don't give a fuck.' That's how I feel about it.\" Barry goes off to buy drinks.</p> <p>I turn from Barry, whose disregard for intellectual improvement and scientific knowledge is typical of modern Grazia-reading, X-Factor-venerating British society, to his friend Martin, who tries to explain what happened in that trillionth of a second after the big bang by using an empty beer glass - something I secretly hoped someone would do during my research for this article. \"Imagine,\" says Martin, who has an A-level in physics and claims to have read such books as Schr\u00f6dinger's Cat and the Fabric of the Cosmos and alleges that he's finished A Brief History of Time (as if), \"that this glass is a very hot bowl with a frog on its rim.\" Right. \"At the bottom of the glass are some worms that the frog wants to eat.\" Check. \"The frog can't keep still on the glass because it's so hot and so hops around. But as the glass cools, the frog slides down, just like matter did when the universe cooled in that first second.\" I see, I say (lying). \"But imagine if the bottom of the glass had a raised central podium on which the worms sat.\" Gotcha. \"Well, the difference in altitude between the frog at the bottom of the glass and the worms is parallel to the Higgs field of bosons that pertained in that first second and gave all mass-bearing matter its properties.\" Why does the frog slide down the glass? \"Because of time's arrow,\" says Martin, settling back in his seat proudly. Right. And what do the worms represent? \"That's not important.\" Frankly, I don't think Martin did read all those books. Or if he did, he didn't understand them.</p> <p>Barry, thankfully, comes back with his round. \"And the other thing is,\" Barry says, \"if we are going to get sucked through a black hole on Wednesday morning, I don't find it reassuring when scientists say these are going to be really small, miscroscopic black holes that they're going to be creating in Switzerland. That surely just means it's going to be more painful than if they were big holes, doesn't it?\" Marginally, perhaps, I concede. \"After all, it's more painful to get sucked through a hole smaller than the eye of a needle than one that's bigger, isn't it?\" </p> <p>I guess. At this point, I rise from the table and bid Barry and Martin, whom I would like to thank for their hospitality and for helping me not at all in increasing my knowledge of particle physics, a fond farewell.</p> <p>The following day I ring Edward Pattison, a physics teacher at Hayes School in Bromley, south-east London, for a Cern primer, ideally not featuring hot frogs in beer glasses. \"You're familiar, I hope with E=mc2,\" asks Pattison. Absolutely - and not just because it was a song by Big Audio Dynamite. \"Well, the more energy, the more mass you create and so you can make big particles - things that previously only existed in the big bang. Tomorrow is just the start, but as the Large Hadron Collider speeds up and up, it'll show what was there in the earliest seconds after the big bang, and then earlier in the big bang and earlier still as it speeds up. We should be able to see dark matter, which is what holds much of the galaxies together. You'll be showing what black holes are like, creating microscopic ones.\" </p> <p>Should I be worried that the creation of little black holes at Cern will mean I and my loved ones will be dragged towards Switzerland and thence to oblivion? \"No. The smaller they are - and the ones they may create will be tiny - the faster they disappear because they radiate very quickly and so, as it were, evaporate. And anyway, we already find them in space. We shouldn't worry about being gobbled up.\" Excellent.</p> <p>Next I ring Professor Jim al-Khalili, who is not only a theoretical nuclear physicist at the University of Surrey, but also has an OBE. Why is this experiment being undertaken now? \"We seem to have got to the point in describing the Standard Model where the theory has guesswork in it and it needs to be verified or falsified by experiment.\" The Standard Model, you'll be eager to learn, describes three of the four known fundamental interactions among the elementary particles that make up all matter. That theory, I learn, predicts the Higgs boson particle which has never been observed except, possibly, by God - and then only billions of years ago for a split second. He might have blinked and missed it. So he might like a mini-reprise. If he exists.</p> <p>\"You see, particle experimentalists have been almost twiddling their thumbs because, up until now, we haven't been able to create the energies necessary to create theses particles - if they indeed exist - while theorists have been theorising wildly,\" says al-Khalili. \"What we can do now is, for a fraction of a second, create the particles, the Higgs bosons, that theorists argue have not been around since the big bang.\" Why is that important? \"Because the Higgs boson, it is hypothesised, endows other particles with its properties. Mass for instance.\"</p> <p>Earlier, I had asked Rees to explain to me what a Higgs boson is. \"No,\" he replied firmly. Why not? \"It would take too long.\"</p> <p>Al-Khalili is more forthcoming. There is a story, he relates, that William Waldegrave, when science minister in Margaret Thatcher's government in the 1980s, launched a competition to explain what the hell this chuffing boson was (he didn't quite use those words). The winner compared the Higgs boson to treacle or molasses through which other particles passed shortly after the big bang. \"Another, better, story that appealed to Waldegrave was that of a cocktail party in a room into which a famous celebrity walks, Margaret Thatcher for instance. A huddle forms around her as she walks through the room and she finds it difficult to move. Then other non-celebrities come through the room and find it easy to move around - these are the particles that don't have much mass.\" Like neutrinos? \"That's right.\" The poor little sweethearts! Hold on, though; what do the guests at the party represent? \"The huddle of guests represents the Higgs bosons that form a field. It's, so far, a mathematical description, and the hope is that we will find, by means of the LHC, that it does exist by crashing these protons into each other.\" In the sub-atomic post-collision debris? \"That's it.\"</p> <p>What will happen if the experiment doesn't produce Higgs bosons? \"Well, the whole hypothesis might be wrong, and we will discover whether it's right or wrong in the next two years. For me, if it is proved wrong then it could be very exciting. All kinds of other possibilities could be discovered.\"</p> <p>Indeed, what al-Khalili calls one of the most powerful rival ideas is the so-called supersymmetric particles. What are they? \"They are the mystery, the dark matter that has been missing that we have never been able to see.\" Spooky. How do we know that they exist? \"We know dark matter is there because we know how it affects what we do see. It would be nice to see it, which is a possibility that the LHC holds out.\"</p> <p>Rees also hopes that the LHC will discover these hypothesised particles. \"Speaking as a cosmologist, I'm hopeful - indeed, I rather expect - that the LHC will reveal so-called supersymmetric particles,\" he says, \"because it is quite possible that they are 80% to 90% of what holds the galaxies together.\" That makes the research sound very important indeed. \"It is. It is absolutely the biggest science experiment ever conducted and so very exciting and important.\" Why? \"It may give us an answer to one of the key mysteries about the universe - the \"dark matter.\" Atoms make up only around 10% of the gravitating stuff that holds galaxies together. [I thought it was 5%, but let's not get sidetracked.] The rest probably consists of particles left over from the fiery beginning of the universe, but as yet we have only the haziest idea what they are.\" Again, I find it cosmically reassuring that even astronomers royal have only hazy ideas about such things.</p> <p>Is Cern's work worthwhile? After all, Sir David King, the government's former chief science adviser, recently argued that the \u00a3500m Britain has contributed to the LHC project diverts top scientists away from tackling the more pressing issues of the age, such as climate change and how to decarbonise the economy. \"I hear that kind of objection a lot,\" says al-Khalili. \"It's certainly not going to lead to a quality-of-life improvement, but even from just a cultural point of view it's important to know. There are certain things that a civilised, enlightened society should try to know. If it also captures the admiration and imagination of children who get into science as a result - which I think it will - then it is surely a good thing.\"</p> <p>Good point. If future generations are less ignorant than me about the nature of reality and what happened at the dawn of time, then that would be to the glory of humanity (among other things). \"It's a good moment to be a physics teacher,\" says Pattison. \"I keep getting stopped in the corridor by kids asking what it's about - the big bang, the LHC, all that. It's the most weird and wonderful things that interest them - stuff like this and quantum physics. </p> <p>\"There's a problem with the curriculum,\" he adds. \"What children study is supposed to be relevant to children's lives. As a result, we no longer teach relativity as part of an A-level course. But it is just this sort of thing that entrances children. If I had my way, I would teach 11-year-olds about space, quantum mechanics and relativity - obviously at a basic level. But to get children thrilled by physics at an early age seems to me to be important and Cern is helping with that.\"</p> <p>This resonates for me. I recall that my physics O-level course ended before we had even broached radioactivity. It ended without a big bang, but with something of a whimper. Perhaps that is why I stopped studying physics at 16 and now find myself struggling to understand the exciting things that physicists are doing. Many of the great heroes of physics - Faraday, Rutherford, Einstein, Dirac - never got namechecked in my class (I had to piece them together in remedial reading as an adult); still less were we as thrilled by the subject as the pupils Edward Pattison says have been bombarding him with questions, inspired by what will soon happen beneath some Swiss fields. It would be good if British children are less scientifically ignorant than I am. Perhaps, in my dotage, they could even explain to me what Quantum of Solace means. Or maybe that's too much to hope.</p>",
  "<p>Dramatic, sculptural and enormous, the brutalist buildings designed by Rodney Gordon, who has died aged 75, are among the most iconic of the second half of the 20th century. Despised by many as concrete monstrosities, with some now demolished, they sought to bring what he saw as the logic and reason of Modernist interwar architecture to an invigorated postwar world of expanded opportunities - \"the age of the people\", where, as he recalled, \"feelings of egalitarianism and concern for all was the norm\". </p> <p>However, while most of his successful contemporaries worked in the public sector, or for traditional prestige clients such as universities, Gordon was to build his reputation in a very different, new environment - that of commercial architecture and, especially, the developer-led shopping centre.</p> <p>As the leading designer at the Owen Luder Partnership, he was responsible for the Tricorn Centre, Portsmouth (1966) - which, in 2001, BBC Radio 4 listeners voted the most hated building in the UK. It was demolished three years later, despite a campaign to save it.</p> <p>He also designed the Trinity Centre, Gateshead, which became known to a wider audience as the carpark from whose roof mobster Jack Carter (Michael Caine) threw the corrupt councillor Cliff Brumby (Bryan Mosley) in the 1971 cult film Get Carter. Loved and loathed, but never unnoticed, Gordon's audacious designs marked him out as a seminal figure in English brutalist architecture.</p> <p>He was born in Wanstead, east London, to a Polish-Russian father and a Chilean mother. While Gordon was a boy, the family moved to High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, and later to Chelsea. A gifted scholar, he went to University College hospital medical school, London, at 16. But, two years later, he moved to the Hammersmith School of Building and later studied at the Architectural Association School of Architecture in London, under the Bauhaus architect Arthur Korn.</p> <p>On qualifying in 1957, he got a job in the general division at the London county council (LCC) - \"the place to be for a young architect\". While there he was responsible for designing the Michael Faraday Memorial, the elegant stainless-steel box that sits in the middle of the Elephant and Castle roundabout, housing a transformer for London's tube system. This structure was listed in 1996 as \"a building of architectural quality and panache\", and a precursor to \"high-tech\" architecture of the 1970s and 80s.</p> <p>In 1959, an LCC colleague, Dennis Drawbridge, introduced Gordon to Owen Luder. By the end of the year he had joined the Owen Luder Partnership and drawn up Eros House, in Catford, south-east London, while sitting in bed recovering from jaundice. Realising that the budget was insufficient for high-quality concrete, he deliberately detailed the exposed beams, columns and floor slabs to make what he described as \"a convoluted sculptural form\" which would dominate and distract from the poor surface finishes. The building won the Riba bronze medal for London in 1962.</p> <p>Although speed was as crucial as economy, Gordon felt in control of the end product. But this was not to last. Luder proved extraordinarily good as job-getter and business manager. Office blocks and shopping centres in Bromley, Hayes, Hounslow, Hammersmith, Coalville and Leicester, as well as the better-known examples in Portsmouth and Gateshead, followed and the office rapidly expanded. There was critical recognition and acclaim, with Ian Nairn, in an Observer article entitled Flamboyance in Concrete, describing the Tricorn as \"an animal, various and cranky, capable of inspiring recognition and affection ... the first no-holds barred explosion\" of a new architecture. It also won a Civic Trust award.</p> <p>Gordon was design director, with Drawbridge leading on working drawings and site works. Luder never interfered in the design process directly, and Gordon was never to object to his name being attached to the buildings. But Gordon was demoralised when Luder started to accept invitations to represent the firm giving talks to architectural students - a role for which Gordon felt he was much better qualified. Developing tensions were exacerbated when offices in Harrogate and Newcastle were set up to interpret Gordon's designs and, as he later recounted: \"Continuity of design was all but cut off, and I had begun to cringe ... at what was being built\". He refused to visit Gateshead, not wanting to see it close up. It all ended acrimoniously, with Gordon leaving the firm after only seven years - followed shortly afterwards by the rest of his design team.</p> <p>Gordon did not always design in concrete: as well as the Faraday Memorial, his 1961 house for his own family (in Burwood Park, Surrey) is a steel-framed structure, clad with diagonal timber boarding. It has triangular windows, and steel chains rather than down pipes to channel rainwater to the ground. He countered suggestions that it was unrelated to the famous projects by explaining that it shares an external expression of structure. This house survives, although the one built next door for a neighbour was recently replaced.</p> <p>On returning to London after only a few years, Gordon settled in Kensington. Behind a conventional mews facade he constructed a multi-level open-plan space, with exposed concrete finishes.</p> <p>In the 1970s he worked with Abbott Howard before founding Batir International Architects with Ray Baum and Larry Abbot - this became Tripos Architects in the early 1980s. In 1979, Batir designed one building with extraordinary panache, a bronze anodised aluminum-clad combination of shops, offices and flats on St James's Street, London. Its rocket-like corner turret is a nod towards the Edwardian listed building it replaced, and it was a controversial intervention in a highly sensitive area.</p> <p>Gordon knew how to enjoy life and had a reputation for fashionable partying and fast cars. He survived a heart attack at 42, and even when wheelchair bound towards the end of his life was irrepressibly entertaining. His early buildings began to attract new fans, lured by their sense of bold confidence, and Gordon clearly enjoyed being asked to talk about them.</p> <p>Sadly, this recent growing appreciation has had little effect on the owners of his work. Eros House has been altered out of recognition, Tricorn has gone, and Gateshead is set to follow. The Faraday Memorial stands in the way of the Elephant and Castle regeneration.</p> <p>With Gordon's encouragement, The Twentieth Century Society has put the St James's building forward for listing. He is survived by his partner, Sonia Power, his former wife, Janet, and his son, Hugo.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Rodney Gordon, architect, born February 2 1933; died May 30 2008</p>",
  "<p>When Frank rang a brothel in Enfield, he could hear a baby crying in the background. When Alan called one in Southwark, he could make out the sound of a child asking for his tea. And when Mick called another to inquire about their services, he was told that he could have a \"dirty Oriental bitch who will do stag nights, anal, and the rest.\"</p> <p>The men were undertaking research for Big Brothel: a Survey of the Off-Street Sex Industry in London, the most comprehensive study ever conducted into brothels in the UK. The project, which gathered information from 921 brothels in the capital, was commissioned by the Poppy Project, the only British organisation that offers support for women trafficked into prostitution.</p> <p>My co-author Helen Atkins and I recruited male friends and colleagues to help with the research, and warned them that the work might be upsetting. They were to telephone brothels, posing as potential punters, with a list of questions including \"What nationalities are on offer tonight?\", \"Do the girls do anal?\", \"How about oral without a condom?\", and \"What age are they?\" We wanted to look at what really goes on in brothels - how much control the women really have; whether there is evidence of trafficking; if local councils are giving licences for saunas and massage parlours when it is clear that they are brothels; and how the sex industry is growing and evolving. </p> <p>During 120 hours of telephone calls, we established the following: at least 1,933 women are currently at work in London's brothels; ages range from 18 to 55 (with a number of premises offering \"very, very young girls\"); prices for full sex start at \u00a315, and go up to \u00a3250; and more than a third of the brothels offer unprotected sex - including, in some cases, anal penetration. The lowest price quoted for anal sex was \u00a315. \"Come along and bring your mates,\" said one brothel owner. \"We have a Greek girl who is very, very young.\" While kissing used to be off-limits for women selling sex, it can now be bought for an extra tenner. </p> <p>Of the brothels researched, 85% operate in residential areas. Almost two-thirds are located in flats and more than one-fifth are in a house. Wherever you are in the city, the likelihood is that buying and selling women is going on under your nose.</p> <p>Our researchers contacted only brothels that advertised in local newspapers - not those that advertise on websites or on cards in telephone boxes. Because of this we only uncovered the tiniest corner of the trade. But we still encountered brothels in every London borough, with Enfield (a typical residential area of north London) having a minimum of 54, and Westminster at least 71. We estimated that the brothels we surveyed made anything from \u00a386m to \u00a3209.5m in total per year through newspaper advertisements alone. </p> <p>Although it is a criminal offence to advertise prostitution services, the law is not enforced, and this \"blind eye\" approach serves the pimps and punters well. </p> <p>Researchers also interviewed women who have worked in London brothels, and all reported having felt degraded and violated while selling sex. This tallies with previous research: one large US study on prostitution and violence found that 82% of women had been physically assaulted since entering the trade, with many having been raped. More than 80% were homeless, and a majority, on and off-street, were addicted to illegal drugs and/or alcohol. UK research published in 2000 found that prostitutes routinely face sexual and physical violence from pimps and punters, but have little or no \"workplace\" protection. </p> <p>One of the women we spoke to was Naomi, who, like many prostitutes, has a history of childhood sexual abuse. When she ran away from home, she met a man who pimped her - first into hostess clubs, then from a private flat. \"It's an unsettling, unhealthy experience seeing 20 guys a day,\" she says, \"and you don't know what the next person will be like\".</p> <p>A common assumption is that brothels are safer than the street, and while it seems that women are more likely to be murdered if they are working on the streets, the prevalence of rape and other attacks from pimps and punters is also high in brothels. \"The men have up to an hour to do what they like to you,\" says Janet, who was pimped into a Leeds brothel when she was 15, \"whereas at least on the street you can always try to run away.\"</p> <p>Rachel told us about the reality of how much money the women make, as well as the inherent danger in the off-street trade. \"Flats are set up to be a rip-off, to be truthful with you, because you're not going to make money for yourself.\" Rachel made about \u00a3200 a day, but after paying card boys, rent, the maid, and her \"protector\" (pimp), she came out with next to nothing. \"And you're not guaranteed security at the end of the day.\"</p> <p>Alice brought it home to us just how accepted and normalised prostitution has <br>become. \"You sit in a basque, in a window with your red light on. When you get a client you close your curtains and turn your red light off. That starts from eight in the morning.\"</p> <p>The minister for women, Harriet Harman, is determined to curb the massive trade in women's bodies. Last week she released findings from a Mori poll of more than 1,000 British adults on attitudes to paying for sex. It found that the vast majority of both men and women polled would think it \"unacceptable\" if a partner paid for sex; the majority would support a law that criminalised paying for sex; and around half would back a law that decreased the number of women being trafficked into the UK.</p> <p>As our researchers discovered, brothels market women merely as merchandise. Frank was offered \"two for the price of one\" if he visited during \"happy hour\" (any time before 5pm). One brothel owner offered to send two women to the punter's home for a \u00a350 delivery charge; another offered free oral sex without a condom if more than \u00a350 was spent; and at one suburban sauna, first-time buyers were offered a voucher which entitled them to 50% off the next visit.</p> <p>We primed the telephone researchers to look for evidence of trafficking. There was plenty. Brothels offered women of 77 different nationalities and ethnicities, including many from known-source countries for trafficking. One researcher was told by a brothel owner, \"For no condom and anal, call tomorrow. Eastern Europeans promised later in the week.\"</p> <p>One punter I interviewed for another research project told me that in choosing a woman, \"I made a list in my mind. I told myself that I'll be with different races eg Japanese, Indian, Chinese. Once I have been with them I tick them off the list.\"</p> <p>Many people are unhappy that this research has been done at all. The pro-legalisation lobby do not seem to want the horrors of what goes on in brothels exposed, preferring to present such places as being similar to an office environment; simple, clean, consensual workplaces. Punters are also unhappy about public exposure of brothels. One frequent customer at a Soho brothel told me, \"I don't know why people have to research prostitution - the army shoots innocent people, fast food poisons people; no one wants to research them. It's the only job that has no downside. It only brings pleasure to the customer.\"</p> <p>Some of the male researchers had previously been liberal about prostitution. Frank had thought that legalisation would be beneficial to the women, and Mick believed that some would be happy earning good money. By the end of the project, all the men considered prostitution to be a violent and abusive industry, and perceived the punters as harmful misogynists. Nigel said that after weeks of talking about sex to third parties in a cold, clinical way he realised that the women were being used as nothing more than a product. \"The idea of sex started to be devalued and demeaned, its sanctity lost,\" he says. Tony was shocked at the number of brothels. \"They're on high streets, down alleyways and in suburban two-up two-downs.\"</p> <p>Unless we think about sustainable and substantive solutions that will eventually eradicate prostitution, it will continue to grow at an alarming rate - research published last year found that in just 10 years, the number of men paying for sex in the UK almost doubled. </p> <p>What Big Brothel shows is that commercial sex is becoming as normalised as stopping off for a McDonald's. There are two key ways that the UK can respond. We can legalise the trade, make the women pay taxes, and declare the pimps to be legitimate businessmen. Where brothels have been legalised- in Amsterdam, for instance - the illegal sector continues to flourish. Since brothels were legalised in Melbourne, Australia, more than 20 years ago, the number of unlicensed brothels has trebled. Few prostitutes will pay tax, as the act of registering their trade is too stigmatised, and their lives are often too chaotic. There is no evidence that legalisation keeps women safe, but there is plenty that shows it results in an increase in demand for the sex trade. In Australia, $11.3bn was spent on prostitutes and strippers last year, and the trade is growing at approximately 8% a year. </p> <p>The other option is to bring in a law that makes paying for sex illegal, while helping to educate the public that prostitution is not a victimless crime. This has worked in Sweden, where such a law was introduced nine years ago, and 80% of Swedes now support it. Trafficking into the country is now lower than in any other EU nation. This is the approach that government ministers Harriet Harman and Vera Baird support.</p> <p>Most men do not pay for sex. Those who do need educating about the harm that prostitution causes to women and society in general. Some will only stop if they are frightened of the consequences, such as one charmer who told me, \"If she isn't crying but says no, I keep on. I only stop if she is really crying.\"</p> <p>Others are able to justify to themselves what they do, simply because it is not against the law. When I asked why he pays for sex, one regular punter told me: \"It's like going for a drink. You are not doing anything illegal.\" At the moment, he is right. Let's hope the government has the courage to change that.</p>",

The bank made no comment yesterday but senior managers worked late into the night and will be under pressure to make a statement before the market opens today.</p> <p>After the market closed, other banks, including Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley, stressed that they were still trading with Lehman.</p> <p>Investors are on high alert after the near collapse of Bear Stearns in March. The credit agency Standard &amp; Poor's put Lehman on notice yesterday that it may lower its debt rating because of the \"heightened uncertainty\" about its ability to raise further capital.</p> <p>The Federal Reserve, the US central bank, and the securities and exchange commission declined to comment.</p> <p>Lehman had been in discussions with KDB for the past two months but South Korean regulators told Dow Jones that the conversations had ended.

  "<p>Alistair Darling weathered a potentially difficult confrontation with a disillusioned TUC conference yesterday by declaring that Britain was in a good position to ride out the credit crunch even though workers will face short-term, below inflation pay rises and a big rise in fuel and food bills.</p> <p>The chancellor was jeered and faced cries of \"rubbish\" from the delegates when he insisted public sector workers had done well until now under Labour by receiving pay rises worth 39% since 2000, higher than the private sector.</p> <p>But his comments attacking banks for their irresponsible lending and City executives for taking excessive bonuses, whether they succeed or fail, went down well with delegates at Brighton.</p> <p>Overall his speech was received in polite silence with jeering and clapping reserved for the question and answer session that followed. Union leaders afterwards expressed disappointment over his failure to commit himself to a windfall tax, and for offering little comfort to low-paid workers and families struggling with high bills.</p> <p>Darling's main theme was that the government had to live within its means and could not risk creating home grown inflation by allowing higher pay awards to make himself popular with delegates.</p> <p>He accepted the TUC's main point that the current 5% inflation had been caused mainly by the huge rise in oil and food prices. But he insisted that if the oil price continued to fall inflation would come down next year. \"That's why it would be so damaging to allow inflation to become entrenched, as it did in the past,\" he said. \"That's why, in the private and public sectors, pay rises must be consistent with our inflation target. Otherwise every penny in pay rises will be quickly swallowed up by higher inflation. And we all remember the job losses that followed in the past once inflation takes a grip.</p> <p>\"Hundreds of thousands out of work, as happened in the 80s and 90s. We cannot allow that to happen.\"</p> <p>Delegates were right to be incensed about City bonuses. \"You're rightly concerned about excessive bonuses - especially when people seem to get money for failing not succeeding. And that's got to change.</p> <p>\"A bonus should be for hard work, not big mistakes. Excessive bonuses, which encourage traders to take excessive risks, at a time of easy global credit - one of the major reasons for the global credit crunch. We need to learn the lessons to prevent this happening again.\" Treasury officials said afterwards that his comments on executive pay referred to a review by the Financial Services Authority.</p> <p>During questions from delegates from the Public and Commercial Services Union and Unite, Darling insisted that he could not increase public sector pay and would not pledge a windfall tax. But he did offer two small concessions - a review of pay rises at the Department for Work and Pensions where 40% of staff receive no rise this year, and possible pay rises for railway and nuclear inspectors because nobody was applying for jobs.</p> <p>Brendan Barber, the TUC general secretary, praised Darling's performance. \"Not every response will have satisfied, but the chancellor will have won respect for his clear answers and his insistence that fairness must be the watchword of the government's response to the slowdown.\"</p> <p>But Paul Kenny, GMB general secretary, said Darling's performance was an attempt to warm the delegates \"but was only as warm as a toaster that had been unplugged for two hours\". He welcomed the comments on executive bonuses.</p> <p>Keith Sonnet, deputy general secretary of Unison, said: \"There was little comfort in that speech for millions of hard-working families struggling to make ends meet, unable to pay their bills and facing harsh choices. They deserve better than that.</p> <p>\"It's all very well saying that the government has to live within its means, when it is taking the means to live from working people, denying them a fair pay rise and pushing them into debt.\"</p> <p>The PCS and Unite were particularly unhappy about the chancellor's speech. Mark Serwotka, general secretary of the PCS, criticised him for failing to do anything about low pay and expressed scepticism on whether the Treasury would agree to higher pay for staff at DWP.</p> <p>Tony Woodley, joint general secretary of Unite, condemned the chancellor for not taking stronger action against exorbitant rises in windfall profits by the utility companies. Earlier at the conference he had called for the nationalisation of all utility companies and backed the renationalisation of the rail network.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Thursday September 11 2008.

  "<h2>Tesco's green credentials</h2> <p>The Tesco boss Sir Terry Leahy argues that customers will lead companies like his to go green (Tesco chief: we must go green, September 3). However, the public will be able to judge the environmental record of companies only if they are straight about what they are doing.</p> <p>Sadly, Leahy's article is not a very helpful way for consumers to judge Tesco's track record. For example, he claims that \"group carbon intensity per square foot of sales space fell by 4.7%\", while forgetting to mention that because the company has grown by more than this, its total carbon emissions have actually risen, not fallen.</p> <p>The same is true of the commitment to halve carbon emissions from new stores, which is laudable until one realises that Tesco's ambitious plans for expansion will still mean the company's carbon footprint expanding. Yes, Tesco has cut down on its use of plastic bags, but more radical action, such as Marks &amp; Spencer charging for bags, has been much more effective. </p> <p>The science is clear: we need quickly to make substantial cuts in the amount of greenhouse gases we release into the environment. Relative cuts, like the ones proposed by Leahy, will not suffice.<br><strong>Jeanette Longfield</strong>, coordinator, Sustain: the alliance for better food and farming </p> <p>Among the flood of greenwash emanating from corporate spokespersons in recent years, Sir Terry Leahy's claims for Tesco's green credentials take the biscuit. All the carbon-saving and water-saving measures he mentions are sensible money-saving strategies to reduce costs.</p> <p>He does not mention other possibilities: the increase in carbon from the fertiliser-intensive farming necessitated by the buying policies of big retailers; the threat to sustainable local businesses by the Tesco's arrival in our high streets; the carbon occasioned by car use to out-of-town supermarkets; the food miles caused by the company's distribution system; or the oil used in its product packaging - not to preserve the vegetables, but to facilitate shelving.<br><strong>Brian Gascoigne</strong>, London </p> <h2> Publish and be sure</h2> <p>The [leaked] study of convicted sex offenders [by Bourke and Hernandez] on which Philippa Ibbotson based her article (The hidden offenders, September 3) seems to have been withdrawn from publication in the Journal of Family Violence.</p> <p>Social policy should be based on published research so that professionals can assess the results with knowledge of the scientific methodology that was employed.

They tended to be portrayed in Oliver's TV programmes as recalcitrant believers in chip butties, yet they have fought hard against the various companies that run much of our school meals service, to stop the privateers from making a profit at the expense of their jobs and conditions - in the same way they profited by giving school students crap food.<br><strong>Keith Flett</strong>, London</p>",
  "<p>When Waterstone's recently asked 150 MPs about their favourite summer reads, number five on the list was a book from an environment group that only two years ago almost no one had heard of. But in that time, the Transition Town movement has grown from a classroom idea to a sprawling international network, which many think holds some of the answers to our environmental problems.</p> <p>The idea behind transition towns is simple: if you have no faith that governments will take meaningful action on climate change and \"peak oil\", then you can come together as a community to do something about it. </p> <p>It's an idea gaining rapid ground. Last week saw the second anniversary of the setting up of the first transition town, in Totnes, Devon, and also the arrival of the 100th, Fujino in Japan. Communities in each have committed to break free from oil addiction and move, over a period of 10 to 20 years, from a high-carbon economy to a low one. Meanwhile, there are 900 \"mullers\", people considering setting up their own \"franchise\", including Ambridge, fictional home to Radio 4's Archers.</p> <p>It began in 2003 with Rob Hopkins, who while lecturing on sustainable living in Kinsale, west Cork, worked with his class to create an energy action plan in response to the problems posed by the advent of peak oil production. It was adopted by the local council as policy, and when Hopkins came back to England to finish his doctorate, he initiated Transition Town Totnes.</p> <p>\"This isn't what I was expecting at all,\" he says. \"All it is is a very simple idea and a proposition: maybe the future could be like this, so here are some tools you might use. But there is something about it that is really sticky, it really grips hold of people, like burrs. We are all in this together - it's a challenge that calls for us to come together on an unprecedented scale, rather than fracture down further and further. Rebuilding our communities is going to be pivotal in the next 10 to 15 years.\"</p> <p>Transition Network, the coordinating body, cheerfully states that it has no idea if it will work. \"It is a social experiment on a massive scale,\" says its website. But it presents communities with a 12-step guide to a low-carbon economy. Step one is to set up a steering committee to take the project forward. Steps two to 11 are about raising awareness, setting up working groups to discuss topics such as food and fuel, and liaising with local government. Step 12 sees the creation of a unique energy action plan.</p> <p>In Lewes, East Sussex, the transition group's co-founder, Adrienne Campbell, says: \"Doing it with other people is really important - this way it is like an adventure, a collective challenge. When you look at the issues on your own, it can really destroy you.\"</p> <p>The Lewes initiative started when five people got together and rallied hundreds more for a year of talks and films on peak oil and climate change. They now run \"reskilling\" days, teaching clothes' mending, foraging and gardening - skills we have lost but may well need again in a leaner future. Some 20 working groups meet regularly to work out how they want things to change. Regular liaison with the town council makes sure their ideas will leave the paper and get put into action.</p> <p>The original working group has now formed itself into the Ouse Valley Energy Services Company Ltd, and with the help of government grants is rolling out subsidised renewable energy technologies across the area.</p> <p>Lewes is planning on following in the footsteps of Totnes, which last year launched its own currency, accepted only by local businesses, in order to support the local economy and to start people thinking about the way they spend money.</p> <p>The whole thing has been described as \"a party rather than a protest march\", and it is to this concept that Hopkins attributes the movement's success. He says: \"It is positive and doesn't start out by trying to identify whose fault it is. It looks at what the opportunities are around peak oil and climate change, not the problems.\"</p> <p>Campbell believes so fervently in the idea that she has taken to working full-time and unpaid, supporting emerging groups in south-east England. The region, she says, has been particularly inspired by the Transition Town movement, with between 40 and 50 groups starting up.</p> <p>Just down the road at Transition Brighton and Hove, John Bristow, a steering committee member, says: \"The key thing is that we are increasing resilience in the face of future shocks. Times are getting harder with [problems of] food and energy security. As people face that and work together, you create a stronger community. We need shared experience to pull us together, to realise that, rather than waiting, we can prepare for the future, or create the kind of future we want.\"</p> <p>The movement is rapidly spreading beyond its grassroots. The Scottish government has agreed funding to encourage transition initiatives, and in July, South Somerset district council voted that it \"fully endorses the Transition Town movement and subscribes to the principles of the organisation's goals\". It has promised to offer support to all those wishing to join the initiative, with the goal of becoming the first transition district.</p> <p>Ultimately, it is the movement's optimism that gives it its momentum. It is filled with people who, rather than fear the onset of climate change and peak oil, see it with a sense of anticipation, as an exciting challenge, and a reason to discover values that are perhaps less tangible than a new car or flat-screen television, but are immeasurably more precious.</p> <p>\"The way we are doing things at the moment isn't working,\" Hopkins says. \"During the oil age, success and wellbeing were measured in how much oil you used. But now people are seeing that the future prosperity of where they live relies on them not being oil vulnerable. The imagination that kicks in when people realise that is extraordinary, and to see that in communities up and down the country is humbling. That is what gives me hope for the future.\"</p>",
  "<p>Something seems to be happening to \"old\" people. When I was young, the old seemed like a rare, delicate and almost invisible species - here one day, gone the next. Now they seem to be everywhere, hanging around much longer and making a lot more noise. Sir Mick Jagger is 65, but still strutting his stuff.</p> <p>The Office for National Statistics (ONS) recently announced that in the UK there are now more pensioners (over 60/65 years) than children (under 16). They constitute nearly 20% of the population, and are increasing, so we may no longer be able to regard the old as marginal, invisible and non-functional, or even as one category. The nature of being old has changed so dramatically, that our concept of \"old\" is out of date. It is time for a rethink.</p> <p>What is new is the number and age of the old. Consider the following: in the US, the percentage of the population over 85 was 0.1% in 1900, 1.5% in 2000, and is projected to be 5% in 2050. Thus there are 15 times more very old people than there were in 1900, as a proportion of the US population, and by 2050 there are expected to be 50 times as many. Similar figures can be found throughout the developed world, and the developing world is fast catching up.</p> <p>Before the modern era, even individuals who had survived the perils of childhood could still expect to live, on average, only to about 40 years old. As the French humanist Michel de Montaigne wrote in the 16th century: \"To die of old age is a rare, singular and extraordinary death, and so much less natural than others. It is the last and extremist form of dying.\" Thus, very old people are a new and \"unnatural\" phenomenon.</p> <p>But who are the old? According to current concepts, there are four ages of humankind: childhood, roughly 0-20 years; young adulthood, 20-40 years; middle age, 40-60 years; and old age, 60-80 years. However, more than 5% of the UK population is now over the age of 80, and this population is rapidly increasing. In fact, there are 10,000 people in the UK over the age of 100, and this population is predicted to increase to 250,000 in 2051.</p> <p>So the future is not just old, but very old indeed. Some scientists believe that ageing slows above 100 years and may even reverse beyond 120 years, holding out the prospect of some Shangri-La in the thin air of extreme ageing. We are voyaging into a new realm of human life that has hardly existed before, and about which we know very little. </p> <p>The \"old\" are no longer a homogenous population. We need to revise our concept of the ages to include: the young old (60-80); the middle old (80-100); and the oldest old (100-120). These are radically different phases of life, as different as youth from middle age, or middle age from old age. Dame Helen Mirren at 63 shares little or nothing with a centenarian in the dementia unit of a care home. </p> <p>The old are diverse in other ways. It used to be believed that we humans had a fixed maximum lifespan at the end of an invariant genetic programme of ageing, but we now know this is false. Ageing and lifespan are not programmed into our genes; they result from accumulating damage to our cells and bodies due to random events in our environment and cells. The result is that ageing itself is heterogeneous: different people lose different functions in different ways at different rates. But our attitudes and policies fail to take into account this vast diversity of the \"old\". Policies that are helpful for the young old may be harmful for the middle old. Strategies that work for the healthy old, may be useless for the ill old.</p> <p><strong>Medical advances</strong></p> <p>Loss of function has always been a defining feature of old age - after all, that is why older people retire. But medical and technological advances mean that many age-related losses of functions can be overcome, delayed or bypassed. Glasses, hearing aids, motorised wheelchairs, hip replacements and Viagra are just the most obvious examples of this denial of ageing. For these and other health and economic reasons, the quality of life of the young old has improved over the last 100 years. However, the functional problems of the middle old and oldest old are simply not being addressed, resulting in a starkly poor quality of life.</p> <p>We now tend to regard the age of retirement as the watershed between adulthood and old age. But the state age of retirement is a relatively recent invention, located at an arbitrary age. Up until the industrial revolution, retirement at a particular age was an option open only to a relatively few, rich Europeans. Everyone else worked until they dropped. </p> <p>The magic retirement age of 65 has been attributed to Germany's first chancellor, Otto von Bismarck, who in the 1880s, when pressed to pay pensions to war veterans, reluctantly agreed. When further pressed to set an age at which these veterans might receive their pensions, Bismarck is reputed to have demanded: \"How old are they when they die?\" His officials replied: \"Around 65.\" And Bismarck retorted: \"Then they get their pensions at 65.\" </p> <p>Germany was thus the first country to introduce a state pension, at a time when the average number of years spent retired was zero - which made the pension very economic.</p> <p>Now a woman who retires at 60, having worked for 30 years, would be expected to live another 25 years. This creates obvious economic problems, both for the individual and the state. Increased lifespan leads to increased healthcare costs, with a reduced fraction of the population working. Inevitably, that means that more old people will have to work, or work longer. Part of that will come from staying in paid work longer: retirement may no longer be an option for many healthy old. </p> <p>But many are already having to work as voluntary carers for aged spouses, and this will have to develop in the future to cover aged parents and aged strangers. Some healthy old people are happy to do voluntary work when they retire, but more will have to be done to empower the young old to help the older old. Perhaps a more general role for the young, healthy old as volunteers and community organisers would be strategic, as it is not sensible or economic for such a large proportion of the population to have no recognised role in society for such a long stretch of their lives. </p> <p>Old age seems as though it is natural, but of course the exact opposite is the case. Death from old age is very rare in wild animals, and was rare in humans up until a century ago. Only in the unnatural conditions of modern society and medicine can the exotic diseases and disabilities of old age bloom. Old age was created by our past and present culture. We may feel comforted by the large and growing number of centenarians in the UK. But according to a recent Medical Research Council survey, their quality of life is appalling, and one has to ask whether we are extending life beyond what is sensible and humane. </p> <p>During the 20th century, the relentless battle with mortality slashed death rates from infections, heart attack and stroke, resulting in a doubling of life expectancy in the world. But there was no comparable battle with ageing and the chronic ailments of ageing. The result is a massive expansion of disease, disability and dementia at the end of life. </p> <p>Currently, 30% of the UK old get dementia before dying, and this is likely to increase to 50% within a few decades. The reason for this expansion is that the prevalence of dementia increases exponentially with age; as average lifespan increases, many more live to an age where they get dementia. And dementia is just one of many such ailments of ageing that include loss of health, sight, hearing, mobility and memory, with associated depression, social isolation and confinement to care homes. </p> <p><strong>Chronic disease</strong></p> <p>According to the ONS, life expectancy in the UK increased by 2.2 years during the last decade, but healthy-life expectancy increased by only 0.6 years, so years of ill-health increased by 1.6 years. Death is currently preceded by about 10 years of chronic disease or disability, and this is increasing.</p> <p>Government health targets are contributing to this disaster by insistently targeting causes of death instead of chronic disease. And the recent proposals from the Conservatives on health targets repeat the same mistake in spades.</p> <p>This problem is one of the largest of the 21st century. If we do nothing about it, it will swallow up our health service, then our economy, and eventually ourselves. We must do something urgently to help the older old - before we join them.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Guy Brown is a senior lecturer at the University of Cambridge, and research scientist on cell life, death and degenerative disease.

  "<p>Despite heavy investment from the government and the sector, charities are still struggling to recruit volunteers. According to the government's 2007-2008 Citizenship Survey, volunteer numbers in England and Wales have declined since 2005. It revealed that 27% of respondents volunteered formally at least once a month, down from 29% in 2005, and the number of people volunteering at least once a year also decreased from 44% to 43%. Overall, current levels of volunteering are now back in line with 2001 figures. </p> <p>New research by youth volunteering funding body called \"V\" suggests the word \"volunteer\" is part of the problem. Of the 2,000 young people V and One Poll surveyed in July, 66% thought the term was off-putting. Some 21% said volunteering had a boring image, while 24% thought it was \"geeky\".</p> <p>And it is not just this age group that may shy away from using the v-word.</p> <p>\"My friends know I voluntarily work for a charity, but I don't generally say I'm a volunteer,\" says Suzanne Hewitt, 60, from Wolverhampton, who runs support groups and raises funds for the National Osteoporosis Society. \"I feel that sounds rather regimental, like perhaps I should wear a uniform.\"</p> <p>Mike Locke, director of public affairs at development agency Volunteering England agrees: \"The word volunteering does have some negative connotations. Many organisations find they're better off asking people if they'll help or join in. And at policy level, you're talking about things that don't get called volunteering in everyday speech. But I don't think that means we should invent a whole new word.\"</p> <p><strong>More than skin-deep</strong><br>One V initiative will focus on the idea of doing someone a favour, rather than volunteering. But more than a facelift is needed. </p> <p>\"Volunteering itself is changing,\" says Tracey Mealing, volunteer coordinator for healthcare charity Sue Ryder Care. \"Charities need to identify the reasons why people volunteer and recognise that it needs to be more mutually beneficial. At the moment we're not being flexible or engaging enough, or identifying suitably interesting roles for volunteers.\"</p> <p>\"They've always done work on the periphery. There are more skilled people out there that want to be more fully engaged,\" says Mealing. \"We are trying to be more flexible about when people work, and we're now able to link in with other partnership workers to offer NVQ qualifications to volunteers, so we're able to offer educational experiences.\"</p> <p>Dan Kjellgren, manager of the Ivy Project, a Devon-based youth volunteering organisation, cites the lack of support for volunteers with additional needs as a major barrier to recruitment. \"There is little or no funding available to provide the support required for many young people with additional needs, such as disabled people, young carers, those excluded from education and so on,\" he says. </p> <p>The Office of the Third Sector has pledged to create a \u00a32m access to volunteering fund for disabled people as part of the government response to the recent Commission on the Future of Volunteering, but this has yet to be set up and piloted.</p> <p>\"Many people who are claiming incapacity benefit want to volunteer and do community work, but there is a lack of funding to support this activity,\" says Kjellgren. \"The government is proposing claimants carry out tasks such as collecting litter and removing graffiti. Many claimants have a great deal more to offer but lack the necessary support.\"</p> <p><strong>Bureaucratic reform needed</strong><br>The report of the Morgan Inquiry, the independent inquiry into young adult volunteering in the UK published in June, warned that the benefits system is discouraging young adults from volunteering. It said that a \"rigid package of bureaucracy\" leaves potential volunteers concerned they will be denied access to benefit payments. It advised that greater recognition of volunteering as a legitimate job-seeking activity is also needed, along with better support from the business community. </p> <p>While the Morgan Inquiry specifically addressed the issues surrounding youth volunteering, its recommendations can be applied more widely. </p> <p>\"It would be much better if there was an expectation in the workplace that people get involved with meaningful volunteer placements, rather than just one-off volunteering days,\" says Fay Bensen, volunteer coordinator for educational charity Envision. \"Our volunteering takes place during lunchtimes over a nine-month period. This can be a concern for some volunteers who are not sure their employers will support them.\"</p> <p>But it is vital that charities focus on volunteer retention as well as recruitment, warns Dame Elisabeth Hoodless, executive director of Community Service Volunteers. </p> <p>\"Charities need to consider the volunteers they've got,\" she says. \"Are they being offered interesting roles in a supportive environment and welcomed into that? In some organisations, volunteers are perceived as being at the bottom of the pecking order. With that kind of climate, is it any surprise they don't show up the next week?\"</p> <p>Debbie Usiskin, head of volunteering strategy for disability charity Scope and vice-chair of the Association of Volunteer Managers, says: \"The government has put an enormous amount of money into the recruitment of volunteers, but has finally started to realise it also needs to invest in retaining them, with \u00a34m coming in March 2009 for the training and support of managers and volunteers.\"</p> <p>\"There's an assumption that because volunteers don't get paid, the whole process is free. Many organisations have not increased their capacity to support new volunteers. In order for people to keep volunteering, they need help and support, and the people supporting them need time to do that,\" Usiskin advises. \"If we don't invest in the management of volunteers, there's no point recruiting them.\"</p> <p><a href=\"www.wearev.com\">wearev.com</a></p> <p><a href=\"www.volunteering.org.uk\">volunteering.org.uk</a></p> <h2>Key facts</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The UK has 26 million volunteers</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> In 2007, 49% of people in England volunteered on a regular basis</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Volunteering contributes an estimated \u00a348.1 bn to the economy</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> 1.2 million full-time workers would be needed to replace the UK's total formal volunteers</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The most popular volunteering activity is sports, encompassing 45% of all youth volunteering </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> People aged between 18-24 are the most likely to be volunteers</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> 36% of people cite learning career skills as being their main motivation for volunteering followed by 27% who volunteer to make a difference</p>",

  "<p>Ministers and the country's leading electricity companies are expected today to finalise a \u00a31bn plan to improve energy efficiency and help cut soaring fuel bills. </p> <p>But the three-year package, due to be announced tomorrow is bound to disappoint some Labour MPs and leave trade unionists determined to redouble their calls for a windfall tax. </p> <p>The result of nearly two months of talks, the plans are likely for the first time to include a contribution from the independent power generators such as Drax. </p> <p>Gordon Brown is also expected to announce improvements to the cold-weather payment scheme and the restoration of up to \u00a3100m of cuts in the government's own warm-front programmes.</p> <p>The issue, however, has caused rancour within the Labour movement and yesterday the chancellor, Alistair Darling, came under pressure at the TUC conference to do far more to directly help those suffering from higher energy bills, which have reached an average of \u00a31,300. </p> <p>Tony Woodley, the joint general secretary of Unite, warned against relying on insulation measures to cut bills. \"This can't be addressed by lagging the loft, as some crackpots around the prime minister have suggested. Without help with fuel bills now, we'll be lagging the coffins of the elderly if we have a cold winter.\"</p> <p>Executives from the big six energy companies are expected to finalise the package with the government this afternoon. It is understood the two sides have agreed that the companies - Centrica, EDF Energy, Scottish and Southern Power, E.ON and NPower - will increase their contribution to the government's carbon emissions reduction target (Cert) scheme by at least 20% over three years. Final talks have covered increasing the additional contribution to 30%.</p> <p>One suggestion is that the big six suppliers should contribute a further 5%, with the rest coming from the independent power generators, Drax, British Energy and International Power. It is claimed that cavity wall and loft insulation can cut bills by \u00a3275 a household each year. But due to labour shortages and demand the Cert programme is unlikely to be able to insulate many extra homes before winter.</p> <p>By implication, Darling rejected the windfall tax, telling TUC delegates the priority was to ensure energy companies had the cash available to invest in new power stations and help cut Britain's dependence on oil and gas by building more.</p> <p>Ministers are privately pointing out that electricity firms have a commercial interest in improving efficiency. Reduced demand will ease pressure to build yet more power stations.</p> <p>But in an argument that will be replayed with extra fervour at the Labour party conference in Manchester in a fortnight, Woodley claimed greedy oil companies would make an extra \u00a315bn out of the British public in the next four years. He told the conference he had a message for the prime minister, who was to address the TUC general council at a dinner last night. He said: \"Gordon, you have written a book about courage. Take the words out of the page, sweep away the Blairite diehards, put people's interests before vested interests and bring in a windfall tax.\"</p> <p>Ministers will say they will keep the windfall tax on the table if they believe the energy companies are trying to pass on the cost of the energy efficiency measures in higher bills.</p> <p>In his address last night, Brown said that the government and unions must reform in face of the global challenges. \"We cannot wish away the new world and we should neither be protectionist nor shelter from it.\" Meanwhile, Downing Street played down suggestions that an article by Brown in Monitor magazine suggesting it was \"time to adapt and rethink New Labour policy\" was an attempt to abandon New Labour. He admitted \"we need to be honest with ourselves\". He said: \"While poverty has been reduced and the rise in inequality halted, social mobility has not improved in Britain as we would have wanted.\"</p>",
  "<p>A leading investor in Northern Rock has asked who is paying the professional indemnity insurance for the nationalised bank's independent valuer. </p> <p>Andrew Caldwell, valuations partner at accountants BDO Stoy Hayward, is being paid \u00a34.5m to assess whether the bank's former shareholders should be compensated for its nationalisation.</p> <p>Disgruntled former shareholders who say the bank should have been allowed to continue operating or be taken over have begun legal action. A judicial review is due to start next year and shareholders could pursue the individual who decides what - if any - compensation is due.</p> <p>SRM Global, which built a 10.5% stake in the Rock after its troubles emerged a year ago this weekend, yesterday expressed concerns about who was covering the cost of indemnity insurance for Caldwell, who will be assisted by a team from BDO Stoy Hayward and other professional firms.</p> <p>According to the Treasury, Caldwell must tell former shareholders and others of the basis on which he is going to operate in ascertaining compensation levels. His brief is to assess how much the shares would be worth if the lender had not been propped up by the Bank of England. Shareholders say Northern Rock's book value was equivalent to \u00a34 a share when nationalised, but the shares were 90p at that time. </p> <p>The Treasury referred all questions on the matter of how the \u00a34.5m fee would be used, and if it would be used to cover indemnity insurance, to BDO Stoy Hayward, which said: \"It is the firm's intention to conduct a fair, open and transparent valuation of the compensation scheme for the benefit of all shareholders. At this very early stage, it is impossible to determine the likely timescale for this work or the amount of compensation.\"</p>",
  "<p>Once upon a time - not so long ago, actually - the university admissions service Ucas was considered by many to hold the golden ticket to adulthood. Having selected your university choices, you'd sit tight and wait for the offers - offers that you knew would change the course of your life and cut those apron strings with a pleasing snip. </p> <p>How things have changed. Parents have been granted a licence to manage their offspring's university applications for the first time. One in 10 of this year's half a million university applicants have ticked a new box on the form that enables them to name a parent or guardian as their agent, allowing them to act on their children's behalf in the fight to get a place at university. \"Your experience of form-filling will be invaluable to your child!\" boasts the Ucas website.</p> <p>Welcome to the age of helicopter parenting, so named because these mums and dads hover closely overhead, rarely out of reach, whether their children need them or not. Even having arrived at university, students are increasingly found to be phoning mum and dad during lectures and asking them to attend open days and careers fairs. Huddersfield University has had to set up a \"family liaison officer\" to feed information to parents round-the-clock about their kids' progress.</p> <p>Graduation isn't even the rite of passage it once was. One major accounting firm reports that it has had mothers pretending to be their graduate children's secretaries so they can find out more about the job they're applying for and, at Hewlett-Packard, parents have gone as far as trying to negotiate their son's or daughter's salary or relocation package. </p> <p>No wonder the mobile phone has been termed \"the world's longest umbilical cord\". With parents admitting to calling their offspring several times a day well into their 20s, they are essentially micro-managing their lives. So used to being able to communicate with them 24/7 (not to mention chauffeuring them to every \"enrichment activity\", taking on their school projects, badmouthing teachers who tell them off and being their all-round best friend) that they think nothing of making calls both to and on behalf of their adult offspring. \"I want to make sure you don't offer my daughter an overdraft, as she doesn't deal well with debt\"; \"My son won't be coming into work today, he's got a cold\"; and \"My daughter always travels first class. Is she really expected to travel second class on business?\" are all genuine examples.</p> <p>Far from begging mum and dad to please, please give it up, many over-18s seem to welcome such indulgence. In one case, a new recruit to a transport company was overheard on the phone to his mother, saying: \"I have got to go to London tomorrow and they haven't even told me how to get there.\" \"The employer threw up her hands in anger and frustration - here was someone working for a transport company, was 21 and had spent three years at university who was aggrieved because he hadn't been given a detailed map,\" says Carl Gilleard, chief executive of the Association of Graduate Recruiters (AGR), who reports that such examples are not rare.</p> <p>Sue Beck makes no apology for offering to attend job interviews with her 25-year-old daughter and sees no irony in offering the explanation that children are \"slower to grow up these days\". \"Sometimes she'll ask me to do things like call the doctor to say she'll be late, and until recently, there were a few times when she wanted me to phone her work to say she'd be late or that she was ill. I'm happy to help. Why not?\"</p> <p>Bank managers, universities, employers, landlords and the rest of society could, of course, tell these parents and their offspring to get a grip. But what is actually happening, as Ucas illustrates, is quite the opposite. </p> <p>Newcastle Business School at Northumbria University is by no means exceptional in its decision to run special sessions for parents. \"In the past, parents wouldn't typically come to university open days, but in the past three years it's become the norm,\" says Tim Nichol, associate dean for undergraduate programmes. \"We felt the only way round it was to start running two sessions - one for the students and one for the parents, who seem to be particularly interested in the Ucas application system, as well as the finances, accommodation and even meeting the academics.\"</p> <p>Intrigued by just how much influence parents have over their offspring's decision, Nichol decided to carry out a survey. \"We found that 80% say their parents have a lot or some influence.\" Just 2% said they had none at all - a far cry from my own experience in the 1980s, when my friends and I would rather have given up drinking for a year than ask our parents where we should go to university. Most of us knew the answer already - as far away as possible - whereas a growing number of today's undergraduates are studying at the university nearest to their family.</p> <p>At Keele University, a staggering 70% of all complaints come from parents. Ranging from, \"Why hasn't my child got a place in medical school?\" to \"I realise that my daughter failed a couple of exams, but does that really mean she can't go into her second year?\" But Helena Thorley, academic registrar, believes there are advantages to this. \"Unlike many students, they understand organisations. So while parents might start off cross or defensive, once we explain why we can't prioritise their son out of the 500 other people who we're also finding accommodation for, they do seem to accept it and be able to explain to him.\"</p> <p>It's no coincidence that helicoptering has coincided with students - ie their parents - having to pay tuition fees, believe universities. And their financial involvement doesn't stop there, according to Hamptons estate and letting agents, which reports that more and more parents are paying for their undergraduate - and even graduate - offspring's rent upfront, often a year at a time. \"I've just let my own property to a 26-year-old whose parents have paid a year's rent in advance,\" says Phil Tennant, regional sales director. \"For any landlord, that's obviously nice, so of course we encourage it.\" Actually buying their offspring houses, as Tony and Cherie Blair did, is increasingly popular too. \"Alternatively, they'll pay a proportion. It might be that their daughter is starting at Goldman Sachs on a \u00a350,000 salary and mum and dad pitch in so that she can afford a one-bedroom flat in South Kensington, which start at around \u00a3325,000,\" says Tennant.</p> <p>Grandparents are even getting involved in over-18s' lives at Manchester Metropolitan University. \"In the past couple of years, we've seen a significant increase in the number of grandparents who drive them to half a dozen open days,\" says Susan McGrath, head of recruitment and admissions. \"Anything that increases the chances of applicants making good decisions is to be welcomed, although I think the parents and grandparents can influence their children too much sometimes. That worries me because an adult who makes their own decision is far more likely to stick with that decision and be successful.\"</p> <p>Parents have been known to call the clearing helplines saying things like: \"My daughter's out of the country/in bed and I need to get her a place.\" \"Personally, I'd never agree to that without speaking to the applicant,\" says McGrath, who adds, \"I think it becomes particularly dangerous when the parent acts as though they were the child, using language like. 'We would like ... '\"</p> <p>Other universities, including Liverpool, are drawing the line at careers fairs. It's not that they're judging parents. They understand all too well that parents have been encouraged to take an active role in their children's education and long-term future. In fact, many universities say they see increased parental involvement simply as a reflection of how friendly we are with our children now. It's just that it's becoming too difficult to identify who the jobseekers are.</p> <p>Donna Miller, European HR director for Enterprise Rent-A-Car, did a double-take when she started noticing parents at careers fairs two years ago. \"They come right up to us and say, 'What would my son be doing if he worked for you?' while the son is standing right there. It's like they're asking about a nursery place,\" she says. </p> <p>The next thing she knew, parents were turning up at their offspring's job interviews. \"Again, we were amazed, although we try to be polite and say, 'Gosh, it's lovely you're here, but can you wait in reception?' Most recently, we've seen parents responding to the job offer, asking, 'What will they be doing? Can you explain the benefits? My son doesn't understand what a stakeholder is.' We've even had parents turning up for the induction and they've been really surprised when we've said they can't spend the first week of their child's job with them. But this isn't a first day at school.\"</p> <p>Miller, who works both in the United States and UK, believes that what sociologists have called the \"infantilisation\" of society is more prevalent over here. \"It has become so common that we've taken the attitude, 'If you can't beat 'em, join 'em.' It's the way it is for this generation so if you can't include their parents, you risk missing out on talent.\"</p> <p>To this end, Enterprise increasingly involves parents and even offers to send them a welcome package. Snippets from the personalised letter from the MD include: \"With the recent hire of your son 'Brett', I would like to take this opportunity to tell you about Enterprise . . . \" and \"I am very happy that your son 'Brett' has decided to join us. You can be assured that the choice was a good one.\"</p> <p>Other employers take a different view. \"I was shocked when a mother called up and said, 'I've seen a job online. I'd like to inquire about it on behalf of my son,'\" says Liz Moss, UK HR manager at the PR firm, Lewis. \"I mean, if someone in their 20s who wants to work in PR - which is a communications industry - hasn't got the confidence to call us up himself, then I think it's only fair that we reject him.\" </p> <p>RWE npower is grateful for such attitudes. \"The more firms that attempt to stop mums and dads at the door, the more chance npower has of being an employer of choice among parents,\" says graduate recruitment manager Bob Athwal. \"Parents have become best friends, even mentors, to their children and why should we be frightened of that? I don't see what's wrong with them coming to careers fairs or induction weeks. In fact, I'd have no problem hosting a dinner just for parents to meet senior management - anything to reassure them. I intend to use this trend to our advantage.\"</p> <p>Isn't he worried that graduates whose apron strings haven't been cut might not make the most proactive employees? \"Not at all. Although it's mum and dad who are showing the initiative and asking the questions, you can see graduates taking it all in. They're probably finding out stuff about employers they wouldn't have otherwise. Also, the more we're questioned about things like salaries and benefits, the more it keeps us on our toes to be competitive.\"</p> <p>Sherrilynne Starky, MD at Strive PR, isn't convinced. \"The father of a 21-year-old new hire called me up the week before her start date to let me know she was particularly sensitive and emotional and would be best suited to work in a harmonious environment. That was three months ago. He was right - this week I gave her a bit of a pep talk asking her to think about the quality of her work. She immediately 'defriended' me on Facebook. Today's her last day.\"</p> <p>Not every helicopter parent wears the T-shirt with pride (there really are T-shirts available). \"My 20-year-old son is horrifyingly attached to me. This summer, he called us from a trip to Canada to ask what he should do because the car had broken down. I genuinely want him to make his own way in life, but it seems we've given him too comfortable a life and now he doesn't even want to move out,\" confesses Karen Jones. </p> <p>Sarah Briggs - a university communications manager who admits that she's only just weaned herself off helicoptering her two children, aged 20 and 25 - puts it down to her own experiences of growing up in the baby-boom generation. \"Our sheer numbers caused us to compete strenuously for places on sports teams and at the top of the class, for admission to the best colleges and later the best graduate and professional schools, and finally for the top jobs. As our children have come along, we have felt compelled to make the way easier for them, to clear away the obstacles that may lie in their path to success.\" </p> <p>Baby-boomers, Briggs believes, have made nurturing an extreme sport. Like many of her peers, she would regularly put in requests at school for specific teachers to ensure her kids got the best, as well as monitoring their deadlines and lining up their summer jobs. \"While my husband and I have worked hard to ensure that our children are independent thinkers, we still inject ourselves into their decision-making far more than our parents did in ours. 'Never leave anything to chance' has become our mantra in parenting.\"</p> <p>Dr Patricia Somers, an associate professor at the University of Texas at Austin - one of very few academics to have studied helicopter parenting - believes this rejection of the less-attentive child-rearing style of baby-boomers' own parents should not be underestimated. \"Many of them were latchkey children who don't want to replicate that same level of removal from their own kids' lives,\" she told Kay Randall in a feature that appears on the university website. When their children are called to the headteacher's office to be disciplined, it's often they who arrive at the office before the child, she explains. </p> <p>Somers believes technology is equally significant. One minute, you're setting up a nanny cam, the next you're regularly texting your 14-year-old - then your 24-year-old daughter. \"It's just extremely easy to cross the line between being involved in a child's life to being overinvolved.\" And - although this is more relevant to the US - she says parents' safety concerns have escalated massively since incidents such as September 11 and Columbine. \"They worry more about children being far away from home and feel helpless to protect them.\"</p> <p>Somers has found that helicoptering is not an exclusively middle- or upper-class phenomenon. \"All income levels are represented to some extent, as well as both genders and every race and ethnicity. We did find, however, some differences between how mothers and fathers hover.\" Indeed, she and her colleagues discovered that around 60% of helicoptering is by mothers who remain hyper-involved in the social, domestic and academic life of their sons. Meanwhile, fathers tend to intervene in and correct \"big picture\" issues such as bad grades or refunds, often invoking their real or imagined positions of power, title and support in order to intimidate staff. Fathers, it has been shown, are far more likely to go directly to senior university administration to solve a problem and employ threats to reach a favourable resolution. Some universities in the UK report that fathers have even threatened to sue if their offspring fail to get anything less than a 2.1.</p> <p>Such is the extent of helicoptering that some American universities have started offering counselling to students and introducing policies focused on gradual disengagement. The problem back here is that although there is undoubtedly some resistance to over-parenting, Ucas looks set to pave the way in the opposite direction - entrenching into our society even further the message that Generation Y are incapable of taking care of themselves, a diva generation unwilling or unable to learn from their own mistakes and address their own disappointments in life. And that's not fair on them.</p>",
  "<p>The growth of global media channels and 24/7 news networks means the work of charity media and communications departments has never been more important in getting vital messages out across the planet. While once consigned to a peripheral role within many voluntary organisations, press offices are now some of the busiest and most creative places to work in the charity sector. Media and communications departments are staffed by a huge variety of people with specialist skills, from press officers to film-makers, copywriters, designers and celebrity bookers. </p> <p>John McKie, ex-editor of the now-defunct pop magazine Smash Hits, works at development agency Christian Aid as an artist liaison, which means he manages relationships with celebrities to help raise the charity's profile.</p> <p>\"We reach millions of people through our media coverage, but sometimes it helps if you can add a celebrity in the mix,\" he explains. \"They might go and visit a project, and might be able to speak knowledgably about the issues. That can be a massive benefit to an organisation like us, and most charities have someone doing this kind of work.\"</p> <p><strong>Star attraction</strong><br>McKie's past jobs in music journalism mean he is accustomed to working with celebrities, and is not easily star-struck. But there are big differences between his past career and his current work. </p> <p>\"I didn't have to be an expert on the Mozambiquan civil war at Smash Hits, and I don't need to know much about Steps in this job,\" he points out. \"The main skills you need for this are perseverance, patience, a certain strategic brain, and it helps if you have people skills.\"</p> <p>Beth Jepson, multimedia officer at WaterAid, has made similar cross-over career moves. A degree in media professional studies - in conjunction with Mersey Television - led her to gain experience as a runner on the Channel 4 soap opera Brookside. From there, she got a job in admin at Save the Children and worked up to be the media unit co-ordinator before moving to WaterAid. \"My job at WaterAid is to make short films to highlight our work,\" she says. \"I sit in the press office, but my work spans the whole organisation. We use films to gain media coverage, or if we have an event or issue to push.\"</p> <p>This year is the International Year of Sanitation, so Jepson has made short viral films published on YouTube, called Pooing in Public, to shock viewers into understanding how vital sanitation is for public health. </p> <p>\"My job is an emerging one,\" she says. \"You can talk to supporters and journalists, but it's hard to capture what it means to live without access to a toilet. Putting these videos online is quite new and has been hugely successful. Charities are also starting to see the importance of giving a voice to the people they work with, which we can do more of through film.\"</p> <p><strong>Small charities, big ideas</strong><br>WaterAid and Christian Aid are high-profile organisations, with room for specialised jobs like film-making. But there are thousands of smaller, more obscure charities that also need to sell their cause.</p> <p>Jaime Eastham is the communications and membership manager of the Bat Conservation Trust - one of only two in her department. \"With a lot of charity PR, the cause is already sold and it's a matter of getting a bigger piece of the pie,\" she says. \"I like it that this is a more unusual area. Bats are a misunderstood animal and you have to really change people's minds.\"</p> <p>Eastham worked as a journalist in her native Australia and, after moving to the UK, worked in the press office at Action for Prisoners' Families - another difficult sell. The challenge is to find creative ways of getting your charity into the public consciousness, she says, and to think on your feet when stories break that are relevant to your organisation.</p> <p>\"Last year we partnered with the New Covent Garden food company during Halloween,\" she says. \"I also try and turn around negative stories. If a building development is held up by a roost of bats, I try to explain why. Then there was the story recently where a woman found a bat in her bra, after wearing it to work. I had dozens of calls that day, and in the end it wasn't such a negative story at all.\"</p> <p>The real difference for people working in charity media and communications is that they are promoting something they feel is important, often more satisfying than just pushing product at a public relations agency.</p> <p>\"I just find it more motivating to sell a cause rather than a product or service,\" says Eastham. \"Bats have recently been accepted as an 'indicator species', which the government uses to assess the health of wildlife as a whole. That was after lots of lobbying by us. I like knowing that what I do has made a difference.\"</p> <p><a href=\"www.christianaid.org.uk\">christianaid.org.uk</a></p> <p><a href=\"www.bats.org.uk\">bats.org.uk</a></p> <p><a href=\"www.wateraid.org/uk\">wateraid.org/uk</a></p>",
  "<p>In the run-down Anfield area of Liverpool last week, I watched some local young men playing football, guided by coaches from the Premier League giants Everton and Liverpool, with spectators who included Andy Burnham, the minister for culture, media and sport, and more men in suits than Breckside Park must have seen in its lifetime. The occasion was the first anniversary of Kickz, a community programme jointly funded by professional football clubs and the police in some of the country's most deprived areas. Burnham was there to announce that Kickz has been remarkably successful and that more professional clubs - now 39 in total - are to run projects. </p> <p>Kickz's annual report, just released, glows with positives: more than 7,000 young people enlisted on programmes (the target was 4,000), with 2,300 solid outcomes, including moving on to volunteering, qualifications or employment. Police forces nationwide are convinced that Kickz is \"clearly providing a positive contribution to the objective of reducing crime and antisocial behaviour in the target areas\".</p> <p>It is always striking how simple these sports projects are. Essentially, a football is rolled into a bunch of young people, the clubs' \"brands\" attract them, and expert, committed staff try to engage them in constructive progress. The cost is so small it makes you wince. The Football Foundation, the charity to which the Premier League clubs, Football Association and government contribute \u00a315m each annually, is providing \u00a34.7m over three years from September 2007. The Metropolitan Police contributes \u00a33m - there are 64 Kickz schemes in London - and Burnham's department puts in just \u00a31m. There are also local partners, set to increase from 2010 when the Football Foundation will withdraw central funding to 50%. For each project, the annual cost is just \u00a345,000. </p> <p>The genuinely challenging work Kickz does with youngsters who are offending represents a transformation in football clubs' community programmes, which the Premier League's chief executive, Richard Scudamore, rightly acknowledges seemed \"impossible\" a few years ago. The clubs, busy making money, were slow to accept that they could help with the troubles in their neighbourhoods, but their executives \"get it\" more now. They put real money in too - a small percentage of the Premier League's \u00a32.7bn TV revenue goes a long way in community programmes. </p> <p>So, a huge cheer for the clubs, and the power of football. Except that the session at Breckside Park was taking place days after the Abu Dhabi royal family launched a \u00a3200m takeover of Manchester City and spent \u00a332m on one player, Robinho, whom they are reported to be paying \u00a3160,000 a week. That's almost four years' funding for a Kickz project going into Robinho's bank account in one week. </p> <p>The Kickz participants mostly cannot afford to go to a match (some free tickets are given out as rewards), so in a generation, the top football clubs have ceased to be homes of social inclusion and have become businesses, obsessed with being \"global brands\" that exclude the young and the less well off. That puts into perspective the social inclusion work they do. Is this corporate social responsibility to salve their consciences and win friends within the government, or can it become central to the way modern sporting institutions see themselves?</p> <p>Burnham did not gush. He said the clubs should be doing this work, and could be doing more. \"People in these areas built these clubs, and the clubs have a responsibility,\" he said. But there is an alarm bell here for the government. The young people at Breckside Park told me there was nothing to do before Kickz, and nothing to do now except Kickz. They are demonised for hanging around the streets, but painfully little is provided for them. </p> <p>Think how much more the government, the improbably rich football clubs, businesses, social agencies - all of us - could do for young people in Britain if we tried a little harder. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> David Conn writes on football for the Guardian.</p>",
  "<p>We found Fajila and Sirajul tending tomatoes, peppers and other vegatables, but they were in no ordinary garden. This one had no soil, their plants were growing out of what looked like balls of dung, and the bed they were growing them in was a 40ft-long, 4ft-wide plot of tangled water hyacinths floating on land that is flooded most of the year. Fajila and Sirajul were waist deep in water, practising hydroponic farming. </p> <p>These weren't ordinary people, either. Until a few months ago, they were landless peasants from Deara, a village in the coastal area of southern Bangladesh, one of the poorest and most vulnerable places on Earth. People there face regular environmental hazards such as cyclones, floods, waterlogged land, silting rivers, arsenic in the drinking water, river erosion, and the intrusion of salt water. But now they are having to cope with climate change, too, and their imaginative use of hyacinths as new \"land\" to grow crops is part of a concerted attempt by the governments of Bangladesh and the UK to prepare vulnerable communities for present and future disaster.</p> <p>No one doubts that climate change is happening in Bangladesh. Government meteorologists report a 10% increased intensity and frequency in cyclones hitting the country, and in the last three years there have been two of the largest storms ever recorded. Peasant farmers report increased rainfall and chaotic seasons, and everyone says it is warmer. </p> <p>\"We are learning about climate change,\" says Anawarul Islam, chair of the Deara district of about 2,500 people. \"We are experiencing more rainfall every year. The water level in the sea is definitely rising. Every year, we have to increase the heights of the embankments, and the amount of waterlogging is growing. It has led to more homeless people, more social conflict, and more quarrels between neighbours. There is more poverty and less food security.\"</p> <p>\"It's far warmer now,\" says Selina, from the fishing village of Jelepara. \"We do not feel cold in the rainy season. We used to need blankets, but now we don't. Last year, there were heavy rains even in summer. There is extreme uncertainty of weather. It makes it very hard to farm. We cannot plan. We have to be more reactive. The storms are increasing and the tides now come right up to our houses.\" </p> <p>A hundred miles away, Julian Francis, a UK development worker with communities living in the chars - the large islands that form in all Bangladesh's vast rivers - is seeing river erosion increasing, almost certainly because of greater flows of water. Last week, in torrential monsoon rains, he went out on the mighty Jamuna river. \"I visited an area of Kulkandi where four villages with 571 families have been eroded,\" he says. \"People said the river had come about 1,200ft inland last year and another 1,000ft this year.</p> <p>\"Last year, 528 grants were made to families in one district by the Chars Livelihood Project. But since April this year, 518 grants have been made, and there is now a waiting list of more than 300. I was told the river had not been seen in such a furious state since 1988. [ It seems] a new island char had formed in the middle of the river and this has caused the river to change its course ... and this is the cause of the increased river erosion.\"</p> <p>Climate change may not be directly responsible for Bangladesh's waterlogged land, the intrusion of salt water or its river erosion, but it is turning a bad situation into a potential catastrophe, driving people such as Fajila and Sirajul to absolute poverty. Cyclone Sidr, one of the most powerful storms ever to have hit Bangladesh, made 3 million people homeless last November. Meanwhile, food price inflation has left 4 million extra people in absolute poverty this year, according to the World Bank last week.</p> <p>\"There has to be preparation for climate change,\" says Raja Debashish Roy, a government environment minister. \"We are experiencing many changes; some are coming very quickly and others will over years. There is a rise in salinity, more intense tidal waves , floods, droughts and cyclones. We are getting too much water in the rainy season and too little in the dry season. All this has implications for food security. We have to be coping with all these problems, some simultaneously.\"</p> <p>Roy is in London today for the UK-Bangladesh climate conference, at which Bangladesh will make public its strategy to cope with climate change over the next 10 years. Britain will commit \u00a375m to a new international fund for the country to adapt, and Bangladesh will itself contribute $50m (\u00a328.15m) a year. Other countries and global institutions, including Denmark and the World Bank, are expected to chip in. </p> <p>This is the first attempt by any major least developed country (LDC) to methodically address the threat of climate change, and is expected to become a model for others as more global money becomes available after a new Kyoto agreement is in place. \"Bangladesh is the most vulnerable country in the world in terms of the scale of the impacts expected,\" says Islam Faisal, the Department for International Development's (Dfid) climate change adviser in Bangladesh. \"It is the first to develop a strategy and an action plan. The money is not enough in itself to cover the costs of adaptation, but it should kickstart the process and allow the [Bangladeshi]government to access global money.\" </p> <p>Which is where Fajila and Sirajul come in. Their hydroponic garden, developed under a Dfid-funded disaster management plan, includes raising houses 3ft above the present high water line, introducing salt-tolerant crops, encouraging crab and duck farming, and rainwater harvesting.</p> <p>\"More than 70 [adaptation] initiatives have been identified,\" says Mamunur Rashid, director of the Bangladesh government's disaster management programme.</p> <p>One of the most successful is an education programme. A local NGO, Shushilan, employs a full-time theatre troupe to travel to festivals and villages, informing people about climate change and how to adapt to it. Another sends volunteers to communities, with educational \"flipcharts\".</p> <p>The initiatives are popular. \"Growing food like this is labour intensive, but we don't need fertiliser or pesticides, and the food quality is better than food grown in soil,\" says Fajila. \"At the start, we were very unsure whether it would work, but now we think we can live on what we grow.\" </p> <p>Rashid says: \"What was a scientific debate has become a practical one about development. Without actions like this, Bangladesh would be plunged deeper into extreme poverty. It's about climate change, but also about poverty reduction. It doesn't need new ideas to adapt to climate change, so much as developing what is already there. Climate change comes on top of multiple hazards and dificulties. It could tip people over the edge, or, if countries respond, it could help them.\" </p> <p>Roy is optimistic, too. He says: \"Bangladesh has always had floods, cyclones and disasters. People are used to dealing with such changes. We have a history of dealing with challenges. We are mentally equipped for climate change, but we do need support to prepare for it.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The UK-Bangladesh climate conference is being held today at the Royal Geographical Society, London.</p>",
  "<p>As the economic outlook darkens, the challenges facing the voluntary sector have never been greater. The impact that faltering global markets will have on UK charities will become one of the key issues to dominate the sector in the months and years to come. </p> <p>This supplement touches on the economic and logistical challenges facing large charities and small community groups working at the coalface of social change in the UK. At a time when the work of charities has never been so crucial, the futures of many hang in the balance as a squeeze on funding continues. </p> <p>We examine whether charities are taking advantage of the rise of venture philanthropy and the new breed of hugely wealthy givers. We also analyse the issue of commissioning, considered by some to be the sector's greatest opportunity and others its biggest threat. With the voluntary sector growing in size and number, the number of new volunteers is falling for the first time since 2001. Is the word \"volunteer\" to blame?</p> <p>Vivienne Hayes, chief executive of the Women's Resource Centre, spells out the need for organisation in the face of adversity and we hear from recruitment specialists who believe the credit crunch will actually help the sector get the personnel it needs to weather the storm ahead.</p>",
  "<p>Anyone who has ever wished they were an actor, a detective, an undercover agent, an investigative reporter or a global traveller would fit in perfectly at the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA). </p> <p>Campaigners at the charity spend as much as six months each year working undercover all over the world to expose environmental crimes from the sale of tiger-skins in China to illegal logging in Indonesia to ivory trading in Malawi. In stark contrast to the big conservation charities like Greenpeace and the WWF, the EIA's 20 staff work in an office above Caf\u00e9 Uno on London's Upper Street, Islington, and there is barely any money for marketing. Yet, for a tiny charity, it packs an almighty punch. Since it was launched in 1984, the team has fought dozens of global environmental battles, from playing an instrumental part in the banning of the ivory trade in the late 80s to helping stamp out the illegal sale of ozone-destroying CFC chemicals in the US in the 90s.</p> <p>\"We're small, but we have a niche, and that is an investigative approach, regarding these issues as crimes,\" says campaigns director and ex-journalist Julian Newman. \"My interest is about justice - organised criminal gangs looting the planet for their own profit and nobody really doing anything about it.\"</p> <p>The EIA was set up by people who had worked for big conservation charities, and felt there was a need for a more flexible, fast-moving operation, which could get evidence of environmental offences by working undercover on the ground, and then lobby governments for change.</p> <p>\"Our philosophy is to get close to these issues and not just sit at a desk in London writing reports based on other people's reports,\" says Newman. \"Actually going out into the field and documenting how these crimes are being committed gives us a strong voice in negotiations.\"</p> <p><strong>Eyes and ears</strong><br>With all the environmental problems in the world, the EIA focuses on crimes other organisations are not investigating, which it hears about through a global network of informers as well as its own research. A vast atlas takes pride of place in the office's meeting room, and a dedicated editing suite is crammed from floor to ceiling with hundreds of tapes of undercover footage.</p> <p>Typically, a group of two or three campaigners will spend up to six months briefing themselves for undercover missions. \"It takes a lot of preparation to be get close to targets and be convincing in your role,\" says Newman. </p> <p>Staff are trained with specialist skills such as how to analyse wildlife specimens, tell the difference between real and fake skins at a second's glance and use specialist industry terminology. Campaigners then work for several weeks or months in the field, wearing secret cameras and microphones to get the evidence they need to build convincing cases. </p> <p>They become consummate actors, posing, for instance, as Western investors, timber traders or chemicals dealers, using carefully-crafted aliases and carrying phoney business cards representing dummy companies. Every member of this not-for-profit group is passionate about their work - and they have to be, given the dangers of working undercover. Although EIA has stringent safety measures in place, campaigners' work is often nerve-wracking. Only once in the last 10 years has an investigation gone wrong, when two EIA staff were discovered filming illegal logging in an Indonesian forest by the company under investigation. They were held in a room, beaten up - one lost a finger - and threatened with a gun before escaping. </p> <p><strong>Funding sources</strong><br>The EIA's trips, governmental lobbying and training of local investigative partners are funded by a small, loyal membership and grants from foundations and the Department for International Development (DfID). \"We never have enough money but we do use our money very well,\" says Newman. </p> <p>Deborah Banks, head of EIA's tiger campaign, believes that being a small not-for-profit organisation is an advantage. </p> <p>\"The one thing that keeps me here is our size,\" she stresses. 'We don't have layers and layers of bureaucracy; we can change plans. There's a tenacity about the organisation.\" </p> <p>In the offices of other, larger environmental charities, the sofa in reception might be covered with neat cushions - at the EIA, it has been turned into a makeshift bed for a sleepy campaigner who has just flown in from the US. There is no faceless corporate red tape here, just a commitment to justice.</p> <p><a href=\"www.eia-international.org\">eia-international.org</a></p>",
  "<p>Nothing divides opinion in the voluntary sector quite like the debate over commissioning. </p> <p>On the one hand you have Steve Johnson, the chief executive of Advice UK, the umbrella body for voluntary sector advice centres, who is convinced that it poses a deadly threat to the future of many charities. Johnson is blunt about the damage he believes the growth of commissioning over grant funding will have: \"It's going to destroy scores, if not hundreds of advice organisations, never mind other types of voluntary sector bodies,\" he warns. </p> <p>On the other, you have advocates such as Stephen Bubb, chief executive of the Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations (Acevo), who believes the same process offers an unprecedented opportunity to access multimillion-pound funding streams and a chance to leave a lasting imprint on the nature of public services.</p> <p>The wholesale replacement of grant funding with commissioning, where government funding is allocated through public service contracts following competitive tenders open to private, public and voluntary organisations, is fast becoming an established reality for many charities. The tender document could soon become as common as the grant application form on the chief executive's desk.</p> <p><strong>Test of strength</strong><br>Bubb, who heads the umbrella organisation whose membership is dominated by large service-provision charities, says commissioning tests the voluntary sector's claim that it delivers responsive, client-based services. \"There is no doubt that procurement, competition and tendering has improved the professionalism of the sector,\" he says. \"There is nothing better than having to compete to win a contract to make you consider very carefully what it is you offer.\" </p> <p>Last year, Martin Narey, chief executive of the children's charity Barnardo's, told the House of Common's public administration committee's inquiry into third-sector commissioning that he wanted to see more competition and opportunity for the private and voluntary sectors to compete for large-scale contracts. The sector's big players also have their gripes with the commissioning process. Charities won just two of 16 contracts in the first round of the Department for Work and Pensions' (DWP) Pathways to Work programme in 2007, leading to the sector successfully calling for an independent inquiry into the DWP's commissioning procedures. </p> <p>Short-term contracts, the cost of entering the tendering process - which in the case of Pathways to Work contracts topped \u00a3100,000 - and a dearth of knowledge of the third sector among commissioners are also regularly cited complaints from across the sector. Nevertheless, Bubb still points to the \"huge opportunity for the sector to grow to the point where, as in Australia, we could be providing 50% of the training and employment market.\"</p> <p>But shift the focus away from the national service delivery charities to the third sector at a local level, and commissioning is frequently viewed as a growing threat to the existence of a large number of small and locally-focused organisations. </p> <p><strong>Recipe for extinction?</strong><br>Advice UK's Johnson describes commissioning as \"a recipe for extinction\" and warns that 90% of the UK's 20,000 voluntary sector advice agencies could close as a result of it. Charities are finding out that commissioning is being adopted not just by government departments, but also by local authorities and primary care trusts, and is being applied to core voluntary sector activities as well as large-scale public services. The sector is getting caught up in public service reform, says Johnson, and paying the price. </p> <p>He argues that for many local charities, commissioning does not just mean bidding to win large contracts in new government funding programmes but also competing for vital and long-held public funds against much larger private and public sector organisations or national charities. Lose the contest and you could be forced to close your doors.</p> <p>The provision of advice services is where the new battleground is most visible. Tenders for newly unified Legal Services Commission and local authority funding have been won by private sector company A4e in Leicester and Hull, leaving voluntary sector providers Leicester Money Advice and Hull Citizens Advice Bureau with the prospect of closure or of limping on with grossly depleted resources. Commissioning for advice services is in its early stages but, with tendering in 50 local authority areas expected in two years, the competition is going to get more intense.</p> <p>Commissioning is also spreading to areas such as children's services, third sector infrastructure support, bereavement services and women's refuges, which are more commonly the provision of local voluntary groups. But why, if local voluntary organisations are convinced they deliver a good service, are they so resistant to testing their mettle in a commissioning contest? </p> <p>The answer, many argue, is that commissioning does not test their real value. Service specifications are often narrow, written in isolation from providers, and do not measure their full role, such as the involvement of volunteers. </p> <p><strong>Systematic bias</strong><br>\"With the best will in the world, you cannot capture all indicators and outcomes in a contract. Some of the softer outcomes and unintended consequences are the real value of community and voluntary organisations in local communities,\" says David Harker, chief executive of Citizens Advice. A bias towards large-scale commercial or voluntary organisations not \"rooted in the local community\" is the result, he claims.</p> <p>Large contracts over wide areas also rule out charities whose mission is limited to a small, geographical area or a restricted beneficiary group. And financially, most charities find it difficult to afford the upfront costs of tenders and cannot cross-subsidise contracts as companies can. </p> <p>\"If you create a market environment, it follows that it's going to be conducive to for-profit organisations, who have a company constitution which is deliberately as flexible as possible and permits a higher level of financial risk,\" says Johnson.</p> <p>The solution, according to critics of competitive tendering, is to adopt a broader definition of commissioning. Commissioning does not have to mean competitive tendering. \"We are not against competitive tendering per se,\" says Kevin Curley, chief executive of the National Association for Voluntary and Community Action (Navca). \"Our argument is that commissioners need to be clear about what they are trying to achieve and they need to decide on the best method of funding to achieve those goals.\"</p> <p>Commissioning could mean a contest limited to voluntary and community organisations, or negotiating a contract or set of outcomes with an organisation deemed to have the best track record. </p> <p>\"It's about building upon what in this country is several decades of relationships between local authorities and organisations that provide services,\" says Curley. \"You have a contradiction at the heart of government policy but what they must do is develop a commissioning process which places a real value on local provision and the involvement of people in meeting local need.\"</p> <p><a href=\"www.acevo.org.uk\">acevo.org.uk</a></p> <p><a href=\"www.adviceuk.org.uk\">adviceuk.org.uk</a></p> <p><a href=\"www.navca.org.uk\">navca.org.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Clive Cowdery plans to brave the financial market turmoil by raising \u00a31bn through the flotation of his Resolution acquisition vehicle, which will be run by former City regulator John Tiner.</p> <p>Cowdery intends to use Resolution to make up to five acquisitions a year of insurers, banks and asset management companies struggling in the credit crunch. In total he expects to spend \u00a35bn.</p> <p>Recently thwarted in his attempts to take a stake in the troubled mortgage lender Bradford &amp; Bingley, Cowdery was shy about naming targets yesterday as he unveiled a new management line-up including Tiner, who was chief executive of the Financial Services Authority until last year. This month Cowdery was linked with Friends Provident and he was careful not to rule out any potential target.</p> <p>Cowdery, a philanthropist and insurance expert, does not intend to join the board of Resolution. This is the company's second incarnation. It was originally set up in 2003 as a vehicle to buy up life insurance companies. It expanded rapidly, reversing into stockmarket-listed Britannic, but was taken over by Pearl in May after a bitter battle. </p> <p>Cowdery kept the rights to the name Resolution, however, and intends to start again. The new company will be chaired by Mike Biggs, who was finance director of Resolution the first time round. Cowdery intends to raise the finance for deals by conducting rights issues or using the shares to help fund deals. </p> <p>He has decided to float Resolution because traditional City investors want to be able to participate in the restructuring of financial services companies. Four large investors - Prudential's M&amp;G, Standard Life, Legal &amp; General and Insight, part of HBOS - supported his unsuccessful attempts to bid for B&amp;B this year.</p> <p>Investors such as those are expected to participate in the flotation, which is scheduled for November. \"The whole beauty of it is that public markets want to do more in terms of restructuring,\" said Cowdery, who admitted that the shareholders are likely to already have stakes in the companies in the sights of Resolution.</p> <p>The terms under which Tiner has been hired are expected to be revealed in the prospectus published next month. Tiner will be chief executive and the former HBOS finance director Phil Hodkinson will be a director of the stockmarket-listed company.</p> <p>Cowdery will set the strategy and former colleagues from the previous incarnation of Resolution will play key roles, including Jim Newman, who will be finance director, as well as Ian Maidens and Brendan Meehan.</p> <p>\"Current market conditions in financial services are well suited to Resolution's capability to unlock shareholder value through restructuring,\" Cowdery said.</p> <p>Tiner, who is taking on his first major role a year after leaving the FSA, said: \"What I used to do at the FSA was to look out for the interest of consumers of financial services. Now I want to do it for shareholders of financial services firms who have ... been dealt poor returns for too long.\"</p> <p>The credit crunch has led to heavy falls in the share prices of banking groups. Shares in HBOS, for instance, have fallen more than 70% from their peak in the past 12 months as have those in Royal Bank of Scotland and B&amp;B. </p> <p>Tiner refused to make predictions for share prices but forecast that companies that had spent the last year fighting for their survival would soon turn to looking at their long-term business models.</p> <h2>Profile: John Tiner</h2> <p>John Tiner left the Financial Services Authority as chief executive in July last year barely four weeks before the credit crunch began. As the 51-year-old was named chief executive of the soon-to-float Resolution yesterday, he insisted that the collapse of Northern Rock - a year ago this weekend - was not the regulator's fault.</p> <p>\"I've seen the internal report,\" he said, adding he wished some of the internal processes at the regulator had worked better but that those failings had not caused the downfall of the once prolific mortgage lender.</p> <p>Tiner regards the past 12 months as his \"gap year\" when he took up a non-executive role at asset manager New Star. After his perfectly timed departure from the FSA, he is returning to the public arena to seek out deals from financial companies hurt by the credit crunch. </p> <p>Tiner, who drives a Porsche with the number plate T1NER, joined the FSA from Arthur Andersen, where he led the investigation into the collapse of Barings bank in 1995. By the time he left he was head of its global financial services practice - again leaving with impeccable timing as months later the Enron scandal in the US brought the accountancy firm to its knees. </p> <p>At the FSA he originally worked for executive chairman Sir Howard Davies before being named as the first chief executive when the roles of chief executive and chairman were split in 2003. Arguably his toughest task was the split capital trusts fiasco, which eventually led to payouts for investors in these vehicles.</p>",
  "<p>Rio Tinto, one of Britain's most blue-chip corporate names, has been thrown out of a sovereign wealth fund's investment portfolio for potentially subjecting it to \"grossly unethical conduct\" through its involvement in the world's biggest gold mine.</p> <p>Norway's finance minister, Kirsten Halvorsen, said yesterday that it was selling off the \u00a3500m stake held in Rio Tinto by its Government Pension Fund-Global, commonly known as the \"oil fund\".</p> <p>Halvorsen said the problems with Rio Tinto, the world's second-largest iron ore miner, concerned a joint venture with Freeport McMoRan, a company excluded by the fund in 2006, at a mining operation in the Indonesian province of Papua.</p> <p>\"Exclusion of a company from the fund reflects our unwillingness to run an unacceptable risk of contributing to grossly unethical conduct,\" she said. \"The council on ethics has concluded that Rio Tinto is directly involved, through its participation in the Grasberg mine in Indonesia, in the severe environmental damage caused by that mining operation.</p> <p>\"There are no indications to the effect that the company's practices will be changed in future, or that measures will be taken to significantly reduce damage to nature and the environment,\" she added in a formal statement posted on the ministry's website.</p> <p>The Grasberg complex is the biggest gold mine in the world, and the third biggest for copper. Environmental groups and local people are concerned with the environmental damage caused by dumping millions of tonnes of ore waste, or tailings, into the local river system and the harm that could be done by the stored overburden. Last year, a study published by War on Want claimed that local people had suffered serious human rights and environmental abuses.</p> <p>Rio Tinto, which is the target of a \u00a370bn hostile bid by its rival miner BHP Billiton, expressed frustration at the Norwegian move. The company said it had long been recognised as a leader in the field of environmental consciousness and was not even the operator of the Grasberg mine, which had anyway been given the green light by independent auditors.</p> <p>\"Our immediate response is one of surprise and disappointment,\" said Rio Tinto's spokesman, Nick Cobban, in London. \"We have an exemplary record in environmental matters - world leading, in fact - and they are given the very highest priority in everything we do.\"</p> <p>Ruth Tanner, campaigns and policy director at the anti-poverty charity War on Want, said she welcomed Norway's decision to exclude Rio Tinto and hoped other funds would follow its lead. \"The Norwegian government has again put its money where its mouth is to ensure a real ethical investment policy. Now other pension funds should follow Norway's example.\"</p> <p>Other British companies deemed too \"unethical\" by the Norwegians include the arms manufacturer BAE Systems and the support services group Serco, which was removed from the fund last year because of its involvement in the Atomic Weapons Establishment at Aldermaston.</p> <p>A host of US companies have also been deemed off limits by the Norwegian fund, including Asda's parent group, Wal-Mart, the technology group Honeywell and the defence company Lockheed Martin.</p> <p>The Norwegian ministry of finance also said it had considered but rejected a recommendation from the oil fund's council of ethics to exclude the biotech seed firm Monsanto. The government chose to keep its Monsanto shares and was working with that company to bring about a \"significant reduction in the use of child labour\" in cotton seed production in India.</p> <p>\"The ministry of finance has therefore decided not to exclude Monsanto Co from the portfolio,\" it said.</p> <p>Halvorsen accepted that it was difficult to give precise figures on the reduction in child labour but estimates put it at 90% in one Indian state and 70% in another.</p> <p>\"The Norwegian people's savings are making a difference for children,\" she said. No one at Monsanto was available for comment.</p> <p>The Government Pension Fund-Global invests oil and gas revenues in foreign stocks and bonds to save for when the hydrocarbons run out.</p> <h2>Backstory</h2> <p>The bulk of companies excluded from Norway's investment programme on ethical grounds are US firms that produce <strong>military hardware</strong>. Britain's leading arms manufacturer, <strong>BAE Systems</strong>, is also there, alongside Thales of France and Raytheon, Northrop Grumman and Lockheed. The Norwegians started their ethical \"sweep\" in 2005 and have extended it to include <strong>mining groups</strong> such as Rio Tinto, Vedanta and DRD Gold. One of the highest-profile exclusions was US retailer and Asda-owner Wal-Mart, for allegedly <strong>breaching human rights</strong>.</p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown should be careful what he wishes for. In his tub-thumping 2004 conference speech, he declared: \"I want us to build a shared national purpose, a British progressive consensus.\" He repeated the call for a \"progressive consensus\" a dozen times and for a while this was the animating Brownite theme. </p> <p>It seems the Tories were listening. Under David Cameron, the Conservatives have rebranded themselves as the party best placed to achieve \"progressive ends by Conservative means\". Cameron now claims that his party has better solutions than Labour to the problems of social injustice, poverty, inequality and unfairness. This is certainly not the consensus Brown had in mind.</p> <p>The Conservatives' claim to be a progressive party is a bold one, especially in the light of the Thatcher years. But a longer historical perspective helps. Cameron highlights Benjamin Disraeli's \"one nation\" Conservatism and William Wilberforce's campaign against slavery to show that his party can be on the side of the angels. But it speaks volumes that the Conservatives have to reach back more than a century to find their progressive forebears.</p> <p>Cameron's \"pick'n'mix\" approach to his party's history cannot disguise the fact that the establishment of the welfare state, including the National Health Service, was the single biggest progressive step in our nation's history, and which owed little to the Tories. Lloyd George laid the foundations; Atlee and Bevan finished the job. The Conservatives, at least until Thatcher, accommodated themselves to the welfare state - but they cannot claim parentage.</p> <p>It is foolish, however, to suppose that the Conservatives are prevented by some political law of gravity from being progressive in the 21st century. Successful political parties are never hostages to their past. To be progressive is to believe that societies ought to move forward, and that the measure of this advance is the expansion of freedoms and life chances for all - but especially the most disadvantaged. Iain Duncan Smith's long-standing interest in social justice helped to prepare the ground; and there are now a number of areas, including civil liberties, the environment and education policy, where the Tories can now plausibly claim to be more progressive than Labour. </p> <p>Of course there is a good dose of politics in this Conservative positioning. In their relentless efforts to lose the \"nasty party\" brand, it suits the Cameronites to be seen to care about inequality and unfairness. To some in their own party, it is all soggy liberalism. The ex-minister George Walden has suggested that, when considering an issue, Cameron asks himself: \"What would Diana have done?\"</p> <p>If he is losing friends on the right, Cameron is making them among floating voters - who like the sound of fairness and social justice, especially when it seems to be coming without a price tag - and in some unlikely corners of the left. In his outspoken attack on David Miliband last weekend, Unite's boss Derek Simpson declared: \"We might be better off with Cameron.\" </p> <p>Some Labour ministers are simply incredulous at the Conservative claims. \"People don't join the Conservative party because they are passionate about social justice,\" said one cabinet minister. Treasury minister Kitty Ussher described George Osborne's claim to stand for fairness as \"laughable\", given his policy to raise the inheritance tax threshold. The problem, though, is not that the Tories don't mean what they say about the importance of progressive goals. It is that in some key areas they have little idea how to achieve them without recourse to the state. </p> <p>The Conservative critique of Labour's policies on poverty and inequality is that they have dealt merely with the symptoms of the disease, without addressing the root causes. In his August speech on the theme of fairness, Osborne said: \"To tackle deprivation, it is not enough simply to transfer money - we need to tackle the complex mix of entrenched worklessness, family breakdown, drug and alcohol abuse, and rising indebtedness that perpetuate the cycle of poverty.\"</p> <p>An attack on poverty does require more than moving around money. But the hard fact is that, without Labour's redistributive policies, there would be much more financial hardship for the Conservatives to complain about. </p> <p>And when the Conservatives begin to flesh out their policies for tackling this \"complex mix\", the list includes an expanded health-visiting service for parents, tighter credit controls to protect people from debt, stronger rights of parental leave, and increased funding for schoolchildren from poorer backgrounds. Good stuff, but it is not clear what is especially \"Conservative\" about these approaches; indeed, such confident state action would be welcomed by those on the Labour party's left. It might help the Conservatives to accept that sometimes progressive ends can only be met by progressive means after all.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Richard Reeves is the director of Demos<br><a href=\"mailto:Richard.Reeves@demos.co.uk\">Richard.Reeves@demos.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Lavish parties tend to leave a hangover as the problems of daily life, put aside for the celebrations, come crowding back. China's Olympic party is not likely to prove an exception. The full legacy of the extraordinary events of 2008 in the People's Republic of China will take many years to emerge, but in the short term, a number of pressing problems are clear.</p> <p>The Olympics, with its political project of displaying China's power as much to its own population as to the rest of the world, has been the prime focus of domestic propaganda for several years, rallying people behind the nationalist theme with the promise to situate China as a restored power. It worked: recent opinion polls have reported a strong feelgood effect, with high levels of satisfaction with the government and the direction of the country.</p> <p>But when the Paralympics closes, the leadership might feel the absence of the mobilising appeal of the whole event, with its power to galvanise the country's patriotic instincts and minimise the growing divisions in income, prospects and privilege that are the breeding ground of discontent.</p> <p>A colder, greyer, post-Olympic world is coming into focus, a world in which most of China's customers are cutting back on spending, inflation at home is running at least at 10% with no relief in sight, eroding the country's competitiveness, and in which China must face the new challenges of maintaining high growth and social stability with the constraints of limited resources, energy shortages, concern over climate change and environmental exhaustion. </p> <p>For the past decade, China's cheap manufactured goods have helped its customers - in particular, the developed economies - to keep inflation low. Now, with its manufacturing costs rising, China is more likely to be a contributor to increasing prices internationally. Neither energy nor raw materials are likely to get cheaper, and the cost of migrant labour - hitherto the cheap input that has fuelled everything from rebuilding China's cities to servicing its coastal factories - has risen sharply as industrial zones have spread inland and workers have found jobs closer to home. Employees have already made gains in wages and conditions, and many manufacturers, including Chinese firms, are looking at cheaper production sites.</p> <p>Planners know China's development model to date, while impressive in its results, is unsustainable: it is too carbon-intensive, too polluting and too inconsistent in its effects. Like every Asian tiger before it, China, the biggest tiger on the planet, has to meet the challenge of moving up the value chain, from T-shirts to hi-tech, from low-end production to high-value innovation, from energy-intensive to climate-friendly production. In recent years the early coastal industrial zones have begun to enter that stage, with waves of factory closures the harbingers of a new phase in the country's development. </p> <p>Managing the transition will be a formidable task, and a race against the clock. It will demand action on the distortions created by the expensive energy subsidies that militate against efficiency and other anomalies in China's hybrid economy, all at a time when real incomes - the source of much of the satisfaction registered with the state - are being squeezed. Meanwhile, time is running short in other ways: the future pensions and labour headache of the world's most rapidly ageing population; an acute water crisis and a gathering health bill from chronic air and water pollution - these are only the most conspicuous items on the list. </p> <p>A recent report found 70% of the villages surveyed in north China facing increasing water shortages, with ground water falling rapidly and agricultural production being severely constrained. Two-thirds of the cities, too, are short of water. Air quality, according to a World Bank report censored by the Chinese government, causes more than 600,000 premature deaths a year.</p> <p>The great efforts to clean up Beijing for the games allowed the city's residents to rediscover the lost pleasures of clean air. But the emergency measures that proved necessary in Beijing cannot be sustained. A longer, nationwide cleanup is urgent or the cumulative costs - in health, lost production and environmental damage - will be huge.</p> <p>There is potentially another unintended consequence of the Olympics. Millions of people around the world watched a display that presented China as modern, powerful, energetic and rich. The opulence of the ceremonies, the magnificence of the venues and the sheer scale of games were designed to impress, and will have changed the perception of China for many, precisely as the government intended.</p> <p>But China is also engaged in the global negotiations for the post-Kyoto regime, and its participation is essential if catastrophic climate change is to be avoided. Like other developing countries, China is pressing the developed world to finance its move to a low-carbon model, an unprecedented deviation from business as usual for a country at China's stage of development. Under the Kyoto principle of the polluter pays, developed countries - which are responsible for most past emissions - acknowledge this obligation, but it was never going to be easy to persuade sceptical taxpayers to deliver.</p> <p>Before the Olympics, for most western taxpayers China was a huge and rapidly developing country of which they knew virtually nothing. After the show, the abiding impression is not of the poverty that continues to afflict much of the nation: those images of deprivation in parts of China that do not measure up to the dream were not on view. </p> <p>Any nation wants to present its best face at such a time, but it may prove counterproductive. If China is rich enough to stage that show, western taxpayers may ask, why do they need our money to pursue a track of clean development? Western politicians struggling to make the case for the kind of radical resource transfers required may find themselves wishing the Olympic party had been just a little less opulent.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Isabel Hilton is editor of <a href=\"http://www.chinadialogue.net\">chinadialogue.net</a><br><a href=\"mailto:isabel.hilton@theguardian.com\">isabel.hilton@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Polly Toynbee (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/16/carbonemissions.labour\">Carbon credits tick all the boxes. What's the delay?</a>, August 16) extols the virtues of personal carbon trading (PCT), saying it is the fairest way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. She claims PCT was \"killed by Labour cowardice\" after Defra civil servants \"guessed it would cost \u00a32bn a year to run [and] threw up sundry obstacles\".</p> <p>As an adviser to the Defra study, I'm not sure what Toynbee means by \"sundry obstacles\", but I take issue with her analysis. To explain why, a few preliminary remarks on emissions trading schemes are required. In such schemes, governments issue emissions permits to participants, free or by auction. Emissions reduction results from an annual decrease in the permits issued, while participants can trade permits among themselves so emissions are cut efficiently.</p> <p>Under what is known as \"upstream trading\", permits are issued to fossil fuel suppliers, which in the UK number in the hundreds. By contrast, under PCT - a \"downstream\" scheme - permits are issued to adult individuals and to organisations that consume electricity and combust fossil fuel for other purposes. In the UK, these number tens of millions.</p> <p>Given the numbers, PCT looks the more complex proposition. So what's the attraction? One attraction for Toynbee is fairness, as under PCT all adults receive an equal number of permits free. As she points out: \"Since low earners use less - 20% have no car, 50% don't fly - they can profit by selling [permits] to those with big houses, foreign holidays and gas-guzzling cars.\" But when she adds that PCT \"would be a powerful but voluntary agent for redistribution\" she is only half right, as such a scheme would have to be compulsory to make it work.</p> <p>Of course, one might argue that those with children and those who live rurally or in colder regions should receive extra permits. But assuming that equal shares are fair shares, supporters of upstream trading argue that, if permits are auctioned to fossil fuel suppliers and the auction revenue allocated equally among adults, the scheme is just as fair as PCT, but massively cheaper.</p> <p>While Toynbee is right to suggest that PCT is technically feasible - \"a Nectar or Oyster card shows how easily home and car fuel bills and airline tickets could be deducted\", she says - the Defra study estimated that it would cost \u00a31-2bn a year (and this was no \"guess\" but a careful calculation by the consultancy firm Accenture). In contrast, the projected cost of upstream trading was just \u00a350m.</p> <p>In response, supporters of PCT flag up a second attraction. They suggest that issuing permits to individuals may make them more \"carbon-conscious\", and that this may lead to the discovery of cheap emissions reduction or abatement opportunities that might otherwise be missed. The hypothesis is that PCT will lead to a cut in what economists call \"abatement costs\" that will more than offset its additional running costs, leaving PCT with lower total costs than upstream trading.</p> <p>After careful consideration, Defra rejected this hypothesis. It concluded that \"the costs identified are large and outweigh by many times the estimated potential benefits of personal carbon trading\". Nothing in Toynbee's article challenges this conclusion.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Richard Starkey is a research fellow at the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, University of Manchester <a href=\"mailto:r.starkey@manchester.ac.uk\">r.starkey@manchester.ac.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Michael Vaughan said this week that he was \"not sure where the speculation is coming from\" to suggest that he would quit Yorkshire next summer. This was curious, because other counties are certainly under the impression that the former England captain is fair game.</p> <p>A month after he stepped down as England captain, Vaughan yesterday received an ECB central contract which guarantees a six-figure subsidy to his county earnings, making him affordable to rival clubs. This prompted Lancashire, the county of his birth, to go on the record about the prospect of hiring him.</p> <p>\"We're aware, like other counties, that he is available and coming towards the end of his contract,\" said Lancashire's cricket manager, Mike Watkinson, in a statement. \"But we've certainly not spoken to him.\" Asked to clarify if this meant Lancashire had no ambition to hire him the club said: \"You can never say never in cricket.\"</p> <p>Warwickshire, where Vaughan's friend Ashley Giles is cricket manager, also supposedly harbour ambitions. Giles told this column yesterday: \"I've not spoken to Michael about it.\"</p> <p>So could it be that rather than hearing of Vaughan's availability from the man himself, counties are being tipped off by his agents, ISM? Surely not.</p> <p>\"He is under contract with Yorkshire until 2009,\" said Craig Sackfield of ISM. \"I have honestly not spoken to Michael about moving counties.\"</p> <h2>ICC launches fightback</h2> <p>The International Cricket Council will take its first steps against the Indian Premier League when its most senior focus group meets in Dubai today and tomorrow to consider the global game's business model. The ICC is under legal pressure from its $1bn (\u00a3567m) broadcast partner, ESPN Star, to reform its future tours programme and reassert itself over the IPL. The meeting of the Test nations' chief executives will today discuss how to \"take greater central ownership of international cricket outside ICC events\". It is clear the fightback against Twenty20 cricket is on. The ICC said yesterday: \"All three formats of international cricket should be protected and promoted, with Test cricket identified as the pinnacle of the sport.\" In order to deliver more premium cricket to ESPN Star, plans for a Test championship will be resuscitated, although the member nations' visions of how to coordinate this differ wildly.</p> <h2>Virgin territory</h2> <p>Patricio Apey's chances of extending his representation agreement with Andy Murray which expires at the end of the year have been boosted not only by the US Open finalist's improved form and ranking; there is also the matter of the improving standard of dinner invitations the Murray family have received. Murray and his mum, Judy, have eaten with Sir Richard Branson at his Oxfordshire mansion - the introduction to the Virgin billionaire was facilitated by Apey. The agent is a good friend of the chairman of the women's tour, Larry Scott, who is a close pal of Branson, who was in the players' box in New York this month.</p> <h2>City ponder change at top</h2> <p>The purchase of Manchester City has been conducted in such haste that only now have the club's prospective new owners sent an associate to conduct a review of the business. The assessment will lead to speculation that there will be a new executive team installed - the current executive chairman, Garry Cook, is in his first senior job in football after a 15-year career at Nike. Before taking on Cook, City made an offer last year to the deputy commissioner of Major League Soccer, Ivan Gazidis, but he could not be persuaded to leave the US. The club's new riches might mean a fresh approach would not be declined. The news may also present Peter Kenyon with an opportunity to return to the north-west and what was reputedly his boyhood club, before he joined Manchester United.</p>",
  "<p>Lance Armstrong, the seven-times Tour de France winner, yesterday said that he intends to make a second comeback to professional cycling and that he hopes to win an eighth Tour de France next year at the age of 37.</p> <p>If he were to manage the feat - and currently he has no confirmed team, no confirmed entry to the race and nothing more concrete than an interview in the magazine Vanity Fair - he would be the oldest cyclist to win the sport's major event. His spokesman confirmed that the Tour is \"the intention\", although the organisers were not available for any comment.</p> <p>\"I am happy to announce that after talking with my children, my family and my closest friends, I have decided to return to professional cycling in order to raise awareness of the global cancer burden,\" said the Texan, who survived testicular cancer to return to the sport and win the Tour seven times in a row amid what seemed like continual controversy. He added: \"I'm going to try and win an eighth Tour de France.\"</p> <p>There are reports that Armstrong will plan to race five events in 2009: the Amgen Tour of California, the Tour of Georgia, Paris-Nice, the Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9 stage race and the Tour de France. He said that he did not consider age an obstacle.</p> <p>Since his retirement in 2005, Armstrong has devoted himself to his cancer charity as well as running marathons. Most recently, racing in a 100-mile mountain bike event in the Rocky Mountains is said to have sparked his desire to return to the sport full time.</p> <p>He has yet to announce a team for this next venture. The squad that took him to his Tour successes was disbanded in 2007, although his manager, Johan Bruyneel, has moved to the Kazakh-financed Astana squad, relaunched this year after a spate of doping scandals. The Kazakh team were this year refused entry to the Tour. They said yesterday that they had no immediate plans to sign Armstrong. Full details of the American's comeback to the sport are to be announced on September 24. Yesterday, Armstrong said that if his team were refused a place in the 2009 race, he would appeal directly to the French president Nicolas Sarkozy. \"I've already put a call in to him,\" he said.</p> <p>Armstrong was never sanctioned over a positive drugs test during his career but was dogged by controversy, primarily over his close working relationship with an Italian doctor, Michele Ferrari, who was convicted of malpractice, although the charges did not involve Armstrong. Ferrari was later acquitted on appeal. In 1999 during the Texan's first Tour win, traces of a cortisone-based substance were found in his urine but he was cleared on the grounds that the drug was used to treat a skin complaint.</p> <p>In 2005, after Armstrong took his seventh Tour win, an investigation by the French newspaper l'Equipe revealed that the banned blood booster erythropoietin had been found in urine samples provided by the American during his first Tour win in 1999. No sanctions were taken because an inquiry commissioned by the International Cycling Union ruled that the testing had been carried out on an unofficial basis, for research purposes.</p> <p>He said he wanted to put to bed suggestions that he had cheated in winning the Tour. \"Many of the guys that got second through 10th, a lot of them are gone. Out. Caught. Positive tests. Suspended. Whatever. And so I can understand why people look at that and go, 'Well, [they] were caught - and you weren't?' So there is a nice element here where I can come with really a completely comprehensive program and there will be no way to cheat.\"</p>",
  "<p>The feeling is familiar. I had it four years ago and four years before that: a sinking feeling in the stomach. It's a kind of physical pessimism which says: \"It's happening again. The Democrats are about to lose an election they should win - and it could not matter more.\"</p> <p>In my head, I'm not as anxious for Barack Obama's chances as I was for John Kerry's in 2004 or Al Gore's in 2000. He is a better candidate than both put together, and all the empirical evidence says this year favours Democrats more than any since 1976. But still, I can't shake off the gloom. </p> <p>Look at yesterday's opinion polls, which have John McCain either in a dead heat with Obama or narrowly ahead. Given the well-documented tendency of African-American candidates to perform better in polls than in elections - thanks to people who say they will vote for a black man but don't - this suggests Obama is now trailing badly. More troubling was the ABC News-Washington Post survey which found McCain ahead among white women by 53% to 41%. Two weeks ago, Obama had a 15% lead among women. There is only one explanation for that turnaround, and it was not McCain's tranquilliser of a convention speech: Obama's lead has been crushed by the Palin bounce.</p> <p>So you can understand my pessimism. But it's now combined with a rising frustration. I watch as the Democrats stumble, uncertain how to take on Sarah Palin. Fight too hard, and the Republican machine, echoed by the ditto-heads in the conservative commentariat on talk radio and cable TV, will brand Democrats sexist, elitist snobs, patronising a small-town woman. Do nothing, and Palin's rise will continue unchecked, her novelty making even Obama look stale, her star power energising and motivating the Republican base. </p> <p>So somehow Palin slips out of reach, no revelation - no matter how jaw-dropping or career-ending were it applied to a normal candidate - doing sufficient damage to slow her apparent march to power, dragging the charisma-deprived McCain behind her. </p> <p>We know one of Palin's first acts as mayor of tiny Wasilla, Alaska was to ask the librarian the procedure for banning books. Oh, but that was a \"rhetorical\" question, says the McCain-Palin campaign. We know Palin is not telling the truth when she says she was against the notorious $400m \"Bridge to Nowhere\" project in Alaska - in fact, she campaigned for it - but she keeps repeating the claim anyway. She denounces the dipping of snouts in the Washington trough - but hired costly lobbyists to make sure Alaska got a bigger helping of federal dollars than any other state. </p> <p>She claims to be a fiscal conservative, but left Wasilla saddled with debts it had never had before. She even seems to have claimed \"per diem\" allowances - taxpayers' money meant for out-of-town travel - when she was staying in her own house. </p> <p>Yet somehow none of this is yet leaving a dent. The result is that a politician who conservative blogger Andrew Sullivan calls a \"Christianist\" - seeking to politicise Christianity the way Islamists politicise Islam - could soon be a heartbeat away from the presidency. Remember, this is a woman who once addressed a church congregation, saying of her work as governor - transport, policing and education - \"really all of that stuff doesn't do any good if the people of Alaska's heart isn't right with God\".</p> <p>If Sarah Palin defies the conventional wisdom that says elections are determined by the top of the ticket, and somehow wins this for McCain, what will be the reaction? Yes, blue-state America will go into mourning once again, feeling estranged in its own country. A generation of young Americans - who back Obama in big numbers - will turn cynical, concluding that politics doesn't work after all. And, most depressing, many African-Americans will decide that if even Barack Obama - with all his conspicuous gifts - could not win, then no black man can ever be elected president. </p> <p>But what of the rest of the world? This is the reaction I fear most. For Obama has stirred an excitement around the globe unmatched by any American politician in living memory. Polling in Germany, France, Britain and Russia shows that Obama would win by whopping majorities, with the pattern repeated in Africa, Asia, the Middle East and Latin America. If November 4 were a global ballot, Obama would win it handsomely. If the free world could choose its leader, it would be Barack Obama. </p> <p>The crowd of 200,000 that rallied to hear him in Berlin in July did so not only because of his charisma, but also because they know he, like the majority of the world's population, opposed the Iraq war. McCain supported it, peddling the lie that Saddam was linked to 9/11. Non-Americans sense that Obama will not ride roughshod over the international system but will treat alliances and global institutions seriously: McCain wants to bypass the United Nations in favour of a US-friendly League of Democracies. McCain might talk a good game on climate change, but a repeated floor chant at the Republican convention was \"Drill, baby, drill!\", as if the solution to global warming were not a radical rethink of the US's entire energy system but more offshore oil rigs. </p> <p>If Americans choose McCain, they will be turning their back on the rest of the world, choosing to show us four more years of the Bush-Cheney finger. And I predict a deeply unpleasant shift. </p> <p>Until now, anti-Americanism has been exaggerated and much misunderstood: outside a leftist hardcore, it has mostly been anti-Bushism, opposition to this specific administration. But if McCain wins in November, that might well change. Suddenly Europeans and others will conclude that their dispute is with not only one ruling clique, but Americans themselves. For it will have been the American people, not the politicians, who will have passed up a once-in-a-generation chance for a fresh start - a fresh start the world is yearning for. </p> <p>And the manner of that decision will matter, too. If it is deemed to have been about race - that Obama was rejected because of his colour - the world's verdict will be harsh. In that circumstance, Slate's Jacob Weisberg wrote recently, international opinion would conclude that \"the United States had its day, but in the end couldn't put its own self-interest ahead of its crazy irrationality over race\".</p> <p>Even if it's not ethnic prejudice, but some other aspect of the culture wars, that proves decisive, the point still holds. For America to make a decision as grave as this one - while the planet boils and with the US fighting two wars - on the trivial basis that a hockey mom is likable and seems down to earth, would be to convey a lack of seriousness, a fleeing from reality, that does indeed suggest a nation in, to quote Weisberg, \"historical decline\". Let's not forget, McCain's campaign manager boasts that this election is \"not about the issues.\"</p> <p>Of course I know that even to mention Obama's support around the world is to hurt him. Incredibly, that large Berlin crowd damaged Obama at home, branding him the \"candidate of Europe\" and making him seem less of a patriotic American. But what does that say about today's America, that the world's esteem is now unwanted? If Americans reject Obama, they will be sending the clearest possible message to the rest of us - and, make no mistake, we shall hear it. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"mailto:freedland@theguardian.com\">freedland@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>With the failure to reach verdicts in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/sep/09/3\">two</a> high-profile <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/europe/08/01/jury.bombings/index.html\">terror trials</a> in the last two months, jury trial in such cases is being questioned.</p> <p>This morning, certain senior officials and government ministers probably feel like the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Jutland#Two_points_to_port\">admiral</a> at the battle of Jutland who said \"there seems to be something wrong with our bloody ships today\". We have become used to the fact that on occasion obscure points of human rights law can scupper what look like common sense procedures \u2013 deporting Islamist extremists for instance. But juries are a different matter \u2013 they are held to embody the distilled fairness and impartial judgment of all of us. If they are having difficulty reaching verdicts maybe there is something amiss.</p> <p>Juries are central to English justice. Here it's 12 good men/women and true who ultimately decide criminal trials \u2013 not judges or panels of judges like the dodgy Europeans. We are proud of this. During the troubles in Northern Ireland we were forced to suspend jury trial in the province after a programme of intimidation and murder by terrorists. We had little choice, but the reputation of justice suffered nonetheless and the IRA made great hay in terms of propaganda from the so-called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplock_courts\">Diplock courts</a> where a judge sat alone (abolished in 2007).</p> <p>If on occasion the prosecution case is not as strong as initially thought and the jury won't buy it \u2013 all well and good. That is how the system should work. Juries are not meant to be comprised of 12 Jeremy Clarkson think-alikes. The authorities will have to take it on the chin. But juries repeatedly not being convinced \"beyond reasonable doubt\" by what the prosecution (and the intelligence community and a large chunk of the general public) consider to be strong cases is a different matter altogether.</p> <p>When the verdicts came in yesterday in the airline plot trial (which the jury, despite convicting three men for conspiracy to murder were not convinced was about airliners at all) the judge complimented the jury on their efforts in effusive not just polite terms. So he was satisfied that they had done their duty. I am sure he was right. But have the authorities given any thought to the sheer complexity and grinding detail that some present-day juries have to absorb? Is there a way of making some of these cases less complicated and time-consuming without loading the dice against the defendants?</p> <p>Finally I wonder if modern juries are not susceptible to a form of silent, subconscious intimidation. After all, when they leave the secure environment of Woolwich crown court some of them might not feel that they are resuming their lives in a well-ordered society. And as we have discovered in recent months, they can't necessarily be confident that their identities and addresses will remain secret for long.</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/08/tradeunions.labour1\">struggle</a> continues. This afternoon's business at the TUC tumbled through rural social exclusion, child poverty, a hair-raising call for the revival of the British coal industry, and an equally terrifying session about abused and vulnerable workers. Before all that, though, there was an hour or so focused on the state of the economy, and plenty of irate calls to arms. One delegate enthused about the benefits of nationalisation; another claimed that \"New Labour has reached the end of the line as far as privatisation and markets are concerned\"; yet another reckoned that \"capitalism can seriously damage your welfare.\" In support of an amendment \u2013 passed, as it happens \u2013 advocating the state ownership of \"utilities and services including water, gas, electricity, oil and the transport sector\", a fella from the dependably militant RMT at least had the good sense to cut to the quick: \"We want to go back to how it was before 1979,\" he said, to enthusiastic claps.</p> <p>Two hours later, Alistair Darling took his seat on the platform, and the realisation once again hit home. No matter that as business transfers its munificence to the Conservative party, 92% of the \"people's party's\" funding currently comes from the unions \u2013 when it comes to the big stuff, they are from Mars, while the government hails from Venus (or, as possibly evidenced by Darling's impossibly measured, joke-free schtick, Vulcan).</p> <p>Advance copies of his speech came in the bizarre form of 139 numbered paragraphs. They contained endless mentions of the word \"stability\", the usual claims that letting public-sector pay keep pace with prices would somehow \"entrench\" inflation, and three repetitions of an ungrammatical mantra that we will presumably soon be heartily sick of: \"Times are tough, but we'll get through it.\" In the case of those poor souls contemplating insane fuel bills and facing the choice of whether \u2013 as a TUC buzz-phrase would have it \u2013 to \"heat or eat\", the words will surely land just this side of being hopelessly crass. Oh, and while we're on the subject: Darling predictably nailed down the government's refusal to go for a windfall tax on the energy companies, and stuck to the idea that the best means by which to tackle fuel poverty lie in lagging the loft and cavity wall insulation. </p> <p>His brief Q&amp;A with delegates was testy but uneventful; his innate talent for closing down the possibility of any highly-charged debate via a benign kind of tedium was present and correct.</p> <p>But wait: at sentence number 77, we hit upon a possible revelation, which will doubtless be torn apart by sceptical Cifers, and doesn't quite fill me with visions of a re-energised government, but merits some serious attention. From the top, then (in the wake of yet another tribute to the wonders of \"stability\"):</p> <blockquote> <p>\"77. And that's why pay matters right across the board \u2013 in the private and the public sector \u2013 in the boardroom as much as on the shopfloor.</p> <p>78. You're rightly concerned about excessive bonuses \u2013 especially when people seem to get money for failing, not succeeding. And that's got to change.</p> <p>79. A bonus should be for hard work, not big mistakes.</p> <p>80. Excessive bonuses, which encourage traders to take excessive risks, at a time of easy global credit \u2013 one of the major reasons for the global credit crunch.</p> <p>81. We need to learn the lessons to prevent this happening again.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>In response to which, there was a smattering of muted gasps from the media corner, and quickfire conversations about whether anyone in the cabinet had uttered such heresies before. They haven't: this is a sharp departure from the kind of fawning nonsense dispensed by <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7289113.stm\">John Hutton</a>, possibly to be reprised by the blighted Mr Brown when he makes that supposedly make-or-break speech in Manchester. But what does it amount to? Cant? Lip service? Too little, far too late? A quiet promise of the kind of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/02/eu.france\">legislative action</a> already taking shape in Europe?</p> <p>On the last score, I wouldn't bet on it. There again, while the storm-the-winter-palace stuff still bouncing around the conference floor wouldn't allow for such cautious counter-measures, this is an interesting(ish) step. But enough to mend a relationship seemingly heading for the rocks and adding to the Brown government's sense of irreversible doom? Somehow, I doubt it.</p>",
  "<p>Alistair Darling today faced down calls for above-inflation public sector pay rises as he warned unions that such a move risked sparking a \"damaging\" inflationary spiral. </p> <p>Darling was met by a lukewarm reaction when he told TUC delegates in Brighton that a stable economy was \"not an optional extra\" for the government.</p> <p>The chancellor made his keynote speech to trade unions just a day after they backed a motion demanding the government rethink its pay restraint policy for public sector workers in the face of rising household bills.</p> <p>He refused to budge on the issue as he insisted there was \"good reason to be confident\" about the economy's future as long as the government did not sacrifice stability by allowing inflation to get out of hand. </p> <p>Darling told union leaders they were right to be concerned about \"excessive\" bonuses in private sector boardrooms, which he said were one of the major causes of the global credit crunch.</p> <p>But he went on to say that pay rises for ordinary workers had to be consistent with the government's 2% inflation target to avoid widespread job losses.</p> <p>Darling said: \"It would be so damaging for us to allow inflation to become entrenched, as it did in the past. </p> <p>\"That's why, in the private and public sectors, pay rises must be consistent with our inflation target. Otherwise every penny in pay rises will be very quickly swallowed up by higher prices. And we all remember the job losses that followed in the past once inflation takes a grip. </p> <p>\"Hundreds of thousands out of work, as happened in the 80s and 90s. We cannot allow that to happen.\" </p> <p>As the chancellor began his address, a small number of delegates held up banners saying that food, housing and education were \"not an additional extra\". </p> <p>The protesting delegates were members of the college lecturers' union UCU, which has been involved in a long-running dispute with the government over pay. </p> <p>Many of the 100-strong delegation from Unite, the biggest union in the country, wore bright yellow T-shirts bearing the slogan: \"Cut my pay - no way.\"</p> <p>The chancellor was challenged by Janice Godrich, a civil servant and president of the Public and Commercial Services union, about the plight of staff in the Department of Work and Pensions who were facing a 0% pay rise.</p> <p>Darling conceded that the primary cause of inflation was the rising price of oil and food, rather than public sector pay, before insisting that staging higher pay awards would fuel inflation and in turn \"completely swallow up\" the benefits of the increases.</p> <p>He said that while in the short term higher pay rises would prompt cheers for the government, the fallout would be felt later down the line.</p> <p>But he added that the government was looking at the lot of DWP staff, where lower pay was \"a particular problem\".</p> <p>The chancellor also poured cold water on union hopes for a windfall tax on energy companies to pay for help for those struggling with soaring fuel bills. </p> <p>He said the government will soon announce how it will help people reduce their bills on a permanent basis by making Britain's homes more energy efficient, and said the companies must \"face their responsibilities\" to help their customers through a difficult period. </p> <p>But he cautioned those calling for a windfall tax that the government's ambitions to invest in green energy and alternatives to oil and gas depended on \"continuous investment over many years\" from the power companies - something which energy producers have warned may be jeopardised by an additional levy on their profits. </p> <p>Darling also criticised those who \"knocked\" government plans to help curb future energy bills through better insulation \u2013 a move expected to be announced as part of a package of government measures due to be unveiled. </p> <p>He said that, as well as reducing bills, improving home insulation would also create jobs, and a balance needed to be struck between long-term investment and helping people who are feeling the squeeze. </p> <p>The chancellor said Labour had changed the country \"for the better, not at the expense of economic stability, but because of it\".</p> <p>He said: \"Let's not take for granted how we've changed the country. It is what the Tories want you to do - to pretend there has not been any change or progress. Of course we need to do more. But don't let that overshadow what we've achieved.\"</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama today called for new government funding for schools that operate outside the traditional state-sponsored educational system, effectively embracing one of John McCain's signature proposals.</p> <p>Obama pledged to double the amount spent on so-called charter schools, which enjoy autonomy from the strictures governing most state-sponsored schools.</p> <p>In remarks in Dayton, Ohio, today, Obama presented education reform as one of the most pressing issues facing the next president.</p> <p>\"Our kids and our country can't afford four more years of neglect and indifference,\" he said in prepared remarks. \"At this defining moment in our history, America faces few more urgent challenges than preparing our children to compete in a global economy.\"</p> <p>Charter schools have become a flashpoint between educators who want to shake up what they say is a system controlled by bureaucrats and teachers' unions and those who fear they will drain resources and energy from traditional state schools.</p> <p>Opponents of charter schools say they siphon money, teachers and students from other state-sponsored schools, creating a two-tiered system of free education in which the most motivated parents place their children in charter schools. Some educators are wary of for-profit schools, which are allowed in certain states.</p> <p>Conservative backers of charter schools say they encourage competition and innovation in traditional state-sponsored schools, and force bureaucracies and teachers unions to accept reform.</p> <p>\"When a public school fails to meet its obligations to students, parents deserve a choice in the education of their children,\" John McCain said in a speech last week. McCain went on to accuse Obama of ceding control of the nation's state-sponsored schools to teachers unions and \"entrenched bureaucracies,\" a message the Democratic candidate today sought to quash.</p> <p>Charter schools have blossomed across the country, beginning with two in Minnesota in 1991. By 2004, more than 3,000 had opened in 37 states, serving more than 750,000 students, according to the National Education Association, a teachers union that welcomes charter schools but remains cautious about the concept.</p> <p>Under his new plan, Obama would double federal funding for charter schools, paying particular attention to \"high-needs\" school districts, and limiting funding to states that \"improve accountability\" for the schools and intervene in failing charter schools. The federal government currently spends about $200m a year on charter schools. </p> <p>Among other measures, Obama would promote university-level coursework in high schools, boost financial aid for university students, and purchase computers and other technology for the classroom. </p> <p>He would also boost teacher pay, with raises for veteran instructors and teachers who work in \"underserved\" schools. Obama also endorsed the idea of so-called \"merit pay,\" an idea typically opposed by the Democratic-leaning teachers unions.</p> <p>\"When our teachers succeed in making a real difference in our children's lives, we should reward them for it by finding new ways to increase teacher pay that are developed with teachers, not imposed on them,\" he said. \"We can do this. From Prince George's County in Maryland to Denver, Colorado, we're seeing teachers and school boards coming together to design performance pay plans.\"</p> <p>Obama struck out at McCain in his speech today, saying the Arizona Republican has been in Washington for 26 years and \"he has not done one thing to truly improve the quality of public education in our country. Not one real proposal or law or initiative.

  "<p>The money on offer for beating the Texan billionaire Sir Allen Stanford's All-Star XI in Antigua may have encouraged as much cynicism as excitement but the national selector, Geoff Miller, introduced a note of old-fashioned chivalry into proceedings today when he confirmed that Steve Harmison had initially asked not to be considered for selection until after the money-spinning Twenty20 game takes place on November 1.</p> <p>Harmison, who this summer has made a triumphant return to Kevin Pietersen's new-look England side, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/sep/09/englandcricketteam.cricket1\">was named in the 15-man squad for the Stanford match</a> \u2014 in which each victorious player will win $1m (\u00a3565,000) \u2014 as well as the seven-game one-day series in India that follows it, and Miller explained: \"Steve did say that very early on, but we said to him we will pick this side \u2013 if he brings himself back into contention \u2013 on cricketing factors and not on monetary factors.</p> <p>\"That decision was taken out of his hands. I think he didn't want to be thought of as coming back into the side just for financial reasons. I'm sure that was the case and the quality he's shown since coming back into the side proves it.\"</p> <p>By naming a predictable squad for the non-Test leg of England's pre-Christmas assignments \u2013 only Alastair Cook's presence in the Stanford squad raises eyebrows \u2013 the selectors have done their best to avoid the insidious threat of dressing-room ill-feeling. Other names did crop up round the selection table, Essex's Graham Napier surely among them, but an England defeat cannot now be blamed on the presence of a newcomer and Miller was keen to play down the notion that unprecedented amounts of cash can throw team spirit off kilter.</p> <p>\"We've picked the side on cricketing factors and simply that,\" he said. \"There was no financial implication to it at all. I can understand if people feel there are negatives [about the game], but we're looking at the positives. We're a positive-thinking side, we've got a positive-thinking captain and we're trying to think positively.\"</p> <p>The danger is that some of the players will think a bit too positively when it comes to assessing their own fitness. The four non-playing members of the squad will pocket $250,000 (\u00a3141,250) each if England win \u2014 a quarter of what those in the final XI would collect \u2014 and there were concerns during the Test-series defeat to South Africa that Ryan Sidebottom, also named in the Stanford squad, turned out at Lord's and Edgbaston when not fully fit.</p> <p>\"We've got what we believe is one of the finest medical teams in sport and we have the protocol to make sure players are fit for these matches,\" said Hugh Morris, the managing director of the England team. \"It will be the same for Stanford as for any international match. Clearly we want the players to be fit and healthy performing in any match for England and this will be no different.\"</p> <p>The increasingly significant role played by one-day cricket in the international calendar was also reflected by the introduction of seven so-called increment contracts, whereby the cricketers involved \u2013 Tim Ambrose, Ravi Bopara, Samit Patel, Matt Prior, Owais Shah, Graeme Swann and Luke Wright \u2013 will receive an extra one-off payment, dependent on how often they appear for England, on top of their county salaries.</p> <p>\"One of the key recommendations within the Schofield report was that one-day cricket in this country lacked priority,\" explained Morris. \"We've made really good progress in the last 12 months culminating in the 4-0 win over South Africa, and the vast majority of the players with the incremental contracts are one-day specialists. We feel it raises the profile of one-day cricket and helps to prepare for the year ahead with two ICC global events [the Twenty20 World Cup and the Champions Trophy] in 2009.\"</p> <p>Morris also stressed that only \"a small window of opportunity\" was available to England players hopeful of competing in next spring's Indian Premier League. England play the final game of their Caribbean tour on April 3 and face Sri Lanka in the first Test at Lord's on May 7, which gives them little time to take part in the IPL, scheduled for April 10-May 29.</p> <p>\"We are continuing to negotiate with the players' representatives,\" said Morris. \"We have drafted a document which will very clearly state under what conditions players are allowed to go to authorised events and we're finalising documentation over the next week or so. The window for the IPL is quite short next year.\"</p>",
  "<p>Sightings of Britain's two indigenous species of seahorse \u2013 the spiny and short-snouted seahorses \u2013 are on the increase. But an argument is brewing between conservationists over how to protect the creatures that just a decade ago were extremely rare. </p> <p>Studland, near Bournemouth, is home to Britain's largest known colony, according to the <a href=\"http://www.theseahorsetrust.co.uk/\">Seahorse Trust</a>. But while seahorses became a protected species in the UK in April, the trust says that leisure boats anchoring off shore are destroying the eel grass they live and breed in.</p> <p>Steve Trewhella, a marine photographer, has been monitoring the population for the trust. \"We found a pregnant male at Studland four years ago and it was the only one ever seen in the UK.\" Since then, he said, \"their numbers have been snowballing. We're into the 40s now, and still finding more. At least half have been pregnant males. They're not that common in the world and definitely unique here.\" </p> <p>\"We know that eel grass is a really important habitat for a range of species and there's no doubt [boats] cause a disturbance,\" said Ian Alexander, team leader of the region for Natural England, the government body charged with conserving, enhancing and managing the natural environment.</p> <p>\"But it is premature to say the level of protection isn't good enough, because we don't have the data,\" said Alexander. </p> <p>\"Seahorses have definitely become more common in the last five years, but it's happened with the boating community already there. Boating pressure has been static over the period when numbers have been increasing.\"</p> <p>Although the British seahorse survey, set up in 1994 and part-funded by Natural England, has improved knowledge of seahorses using sightings by the public - around 700 in 14 years \u2013 all sides agree that much is still unknown about them. It is the perceived lack of enthusiasm of Natural England and the Crown estate, which owns the seabed, to do more to protect the seahorse habitat, that has angered some.</p> <p>Trewhella said: \"You've got moorings scouring the grass, which is as diverse as any reef and in the bank holidays there are more of them. Some people have said 'well they must be doing ok with the boats there' but we need a closed area to see if it regenerates. Is it in decline? We have no idea.\" </p> <p>He said the opportunity for study should be unmissable: \"There's never been an opportunity to study wild seahorses in the UK. We've watched them courting - things we've never seen before. Each male can give birth to up to 300 young and be pregnant again within 24 hours.\"</p> <p>Neil Garrick-Maidment, director and founder of the Seahorst Trust, which runs the survey, said the wording of the Wildlife and Countryside Act protecting the species gives room for complacency. \"It's a site of international importance. The Act says both the seahorse and its habitat are protected, but if you aren't aware that the moorings off the beach are illegal then you can say you didn't know. </p> <p>\"We're not trying to be killjoys, we're just saying be careful where you put your anchors- don't put them in the eel grass.\"</p> <p>Trewhella also believes that the act should be better enforced. \"Imagine a 50kg anchor in a six-feet depth of water and times that by hundreds of boats. Natural England said they only conserve against intentional damage - it's a get out clause.\"</p> <p>Resolving the issue of the seahorses' habitat will require cooperation. While Natural England represents the government's position, the Crown estate owns the seabed and the National Trust owns the beach. </p> <p>Alexander recommends a voluntary approach: \"Anchoring is a public right. Boats have been persuaded in other parts of the country to keep clear. Voluntary is the right way to go. We all have a vested interest to ensure that the eel grass is protected.\"</p>",

  "<p>I don't particularly regret the failure to waste 90 minutes of my life watching England <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/sep/08/worldcup2010qualifiers.englandfootballteam2?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=football\">squeeze past</a> the postmen of Andorra on Saturday. </p> <p>But it is disgraceful that no highlights are available on terrestrial television of a national World Cup qualifying game, or for the much bigger test in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/sep/09/worldcup2010qualifiers.englandfootballteam\">Croatia</a> on tomorrow. </p> <p>The Football Association is not to blame. The rights to away games are sold by the host association. <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/international/article4710196.ece\">Setanta Sports</a> made the highest bid, seeking to challenge Sky Sports' dominance as a specialist sports broadcaster, and have the rights to every England away match so far.</p> <p>Fans won't be treating them as the plucky underdogs after their refusal to sell on the terrestrial highlights. They say no bid was high enough. This isn't very convincing. After all, they either receive something for the highlights package \u2013 or nothing. They have an important exclusive product in the live England game from which they can make a return. But they clearly want to aggressively exploit that as the \"only\" way to watch England, by blocking half an hour of highlights on BBC or ITV late in the evening. </p> <p>Some people can afford another monthly subscription: the only way to get the game at home. Others cannot, especially in a downturn. Some people can watch the game in a pub. Others have family responsibilities and cannot. Many of England's youngest fans will miss out.</p> <p>Football matches and clubs are not competitive products where I can switch allegiance from England to Italy, or from Everton to Liverpool on grounds of performance or price. That is why regulation matters. </p> <p>The British \"crown jewels\" list guarantees that the Olympics, the World Cup and European Championship finals and Wimbledon appear on free-to-air television.</p> <p>Qualifying matches are not covered \u2013 and can go to cable or satellite. But the FA sells a package of live and highlights rights: England's home games will be on Setanta and ITV. </p> <p>For away games, broadcasters have previously sold on the highlights rights if the game has been live on Sky. Setanta are relatively new players and have set out their stall \"early doors\": they will employ Vinnie Jones-style \"take no hostages\" tactics on England's supporters, going in much harder than Murdoch.<br> In the long-term, the right approach would be a Uefa-wide rule that highlights packages must be sold to terrestrial broadcasters. (For some detailed proposals see my <a href=\"http://fpc.org.uk/publications/global-sport\">Foreign Policy Centre pamphlet</a> on sporting governance). It would hardly be rocket science to agree a fair arbitration process to prevent last-minute poker games over the price of a crucial game on which qualification depends. </p> <p>Smart companies know they do best from involvement in sport by promoting their empathy with the fans. Setanta have decided on the old-fashioned model of a two-fingers salute: we have paid a lot of money and we are here to screw you all for every penny we can get. But how clever is it to have England's fans chanting \"BBC, BBC\" and \"<a href=\" http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/article-1053340/Charles-Sale-Setanta-targeted-travelling-fans.html\">We hate Setanta</a>\" as it is reported that they did on Saturday.</p> <p>The broadcaster is under <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/organgrinder/2008/09/setanta_desperately_needs_more.html\">financial pressure from the City</a> to demonstrate that it can compete with Sky. It should now face a storm of media, public and political pressure to compete fairly \u2013 or at least one which ensures that they come out of the episode with their reputation and future commercial prospects damaged.</p> <p>Perhaps this shows the limits of cuddly corporate social responsibility and the odd nudge to do the right thing. But let's at least try. Here are a few ideas for practical pressure, but others may have better ideas.</p> <p>David Triesman, the FA chairman should make a clear, public statement pushing Setanta to sell the terrestrial rights at a fair price. If it is a row about money, then Triesman should offer to find expert arbitrators involved in UK rights sales. (It may be too much to hope that he will suggest that ignoring the FA and supporters' concerns would be a factor in future rights deals). </p> <p>Andy Burnham, the sports minister (and fellow Evertonian) had a strong record in promoting supporters' trusts as a backbencher. He and his opposition shadows should press this issue on a cross-party basis.</p> <p>Newspaper campaigns would help too. And, if Setanta won't back down on England highlights, why not remove references to them from editorial coverage and match listings, certainly for international fixtures and perhaps for their Premiership games too? They can pay for their advertisements but let's cut the free publicity out. (There may be valid concerns about Murdoch-owned papers being too happy to give the opposition a kicking. Setanta deserve a fair deal but forfeit any sympathy if they want to score stupid own goals). </p> <p>Of course, supporters can vote with their wallets. I am not able to take a purist approach. I've had a Sky subscription for a few seasons. Setanta has been spending a lot of money to tell us how many big Premiership games and international fixtures it has got. I could have been tempted, but I am definitely going to be sitting them out now.</p> <p>If the England campaign is going to be a long hard slog, then the maddening tension will work just fine on Radio Five Live: perhaps it will be a blessing in disguise.</p> <p>This time, England may squeeze through. But Setanta Sports has got its international debut all wrong. Every supporter knows how hard it can be to break a jinx. A speedy relegation may beckon.</p>",
  "<p><strong>A WHOLE LOTTA ZOLA</strong></p> <p>Following Roberto Donadoni's Radcliffe-esque withdrawal from the race to become West 'Am manager shortly after it became it became apparent he hadn't a hope of winning it, only one name remains on the club's Shortlist of Geezers Wiv Sumfink Abaht 'Em Wot Might Take Over From Curbs An Keep It On The Deck In The Irons Tradition. It's no secret that name is Zola, although speculation is still rife over the exact identity of the bloke (or bird) 'oo will end up barkin' orders from the dug-out when the 'Ammers take on West Brom at the 'Awforns on Saturday. Here, the Fiver profiles the remaining runners and riders ...</p> <p><strong>Emile Zola:</strong> An influential French novelist known for his series of 20 novels called <em>Les Rougon-Macquart</em>. The most important exemplar of the literary school of naturalism.<br> <strong>Pros:</strong> A major figure in the political liberalisation of France and in the exoneration of the falsely accused and convicted army officer Alfred Dreyfus.<br><strong>Cons:</strong> Died from carbon monoxide poisoning in September 1902.</p> <p><strong>Gorgonzola:</strong> A mould-inoculated, fetid cheese named after a village that lies north of Milan in Northern Italy.<br> <strong>Pros:</strong> Goes well with claret. Unlikely to look or smell out of place when surrounded by Upton Park season ticket holders.<br> <strong>Cons:</strong> Takes several months to mature; months the club's impatient owners aren't prepared to wait for success.</p> <p><strong>Gianfranco Zola:</strong> Lantern-jawed Italian football wizard from Sardinia who stands four inches tall in his socks. Used to play for Chelsea, news that may come as a shock to the thousands of fans who've followed the club through thick and thin since 2005.<br> <strong>Pros:</strong> Unlikely to bang his head on the dugout roof when jumping to his feet to celebrate a Mark Noble screamer from 30 yards.<br> <strong>Cons:</strong> Has no management experience. Could get frustrated trying to coach players who aren't fit to lace his little boots. Used to play for Chelsea, not that notoriously fickle 'Ammers fans will mind if he turns out to be any good.</p> <p><strong>Zola Budd:</strong> Famously barefoot British distance runner from Bloemfontein, Orange Free State in South Africa.<br> <strong>Pros:</strong> Won't let players' heads be turned by talk of boot deals. Not afraid of employing rough-house tactics in the heat of battle. <br> <strong>Cons:</strong> Was encouraged to come and work in Britain in the 1980s by the Daily Mail, a newspaper no longer renowned for the welcome it extends to unemployed foreigners.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"I know David has spoken well of Preston North End over the years. If he has still got our phone number then we'd be delighted to hear from him.

It's almost like he thinks he's one of us when he's winning and a foreigner when he's losing. Which is typical of a bitter Scotsman.</p> <p>Anyway, it seems this perfidious thinking has knacked the mental process of the underperforming British players in Fabio Capello's squad, who are nowhere near as good as their English counterparts who won the World Cup in 1966. And that comes from none other than Tim Sherwood, who was managed by British legend Kenny Dalglish when Blackeye Rovers beat foul-mouthed Scotsman Sir Alex Ferguson's American-owned Manchester United to the title in 1995.</p> <p>\"If [so far unimpressive Italian manager] Capello gets them in a room and says: 'It will never come out from here and I will give you the perfect alibi - how many of you do not want to play for England anymore?' 70% of that squad would put their hands up.\"</p> <p>Yeah, and the Fiver bets it would be the 70% whose bloodline doesn't go back to King Arthur, Tim. Still, at least players from Chelsea - the team out-tacticalised by no-nonsense British genius Sir Alex Ferguson in Big Cup final - still want to play for England. Tim?</p> <p>\"Does Frank Lampard really want to be out there taking that sort of abuse? I don't think he does.\"</p> <p>Gah! What do you expect from a man shacked up with a Spaniard? Elsewhere, Darren Fletcher has launched a defence of Scotland manager George Burley after his side's loss to Macedonia, where some English people might have gone on holiday once.</p> <p>\"George has really got our backing in this campaign. You can see the effort he's putting in.

Which, given he plays for Serbia, is a little baffling.</p> <p>To impress Juande Ramos, Spain's Fernando Morientes is clicking castanets and heels, showing some thigh and performing some elaborate hand gestures with a fan.

  "<p>Gordon Brown today admitted it was time to \"adapt and rethink\" Labour's policies as he attempts to revive his party's fortunes ahead of the autumn conference season.</p> <p>The prime minister conceded the government \"must do more\" after Labour has suffered a series of byelection defeats and dire poll ratings</p> <p>Echoing his speech in Downing Street on the day he took over as PM 15 months ago, Brown expressed his desire for change in \"the way we govern\".</p> <p>In a pre-conference article for <a href=\"http://www.epolitix.com/latestnews/article-detail/newsarticle/brown-admits-labour-must-rethink-policy\">the Monitor</a> magazine, the prime minister stressed that the economic challenges facing the UK were global in nature.</p> <p>He went on: \"I believe that Britain is well placed to withstand the shocks that these transformations bring, but if we are to seize on the opportunities these new challenges present, then the country, the government, and New Labour must do more.</p> <p>\"Whether global or domestic, deep-seated or just fleeting, the pressures that we face in the short term and the long term have all changed since New Labour first came into government.</p> <p>\"And so, the way we govern must change too. That is why in Manchester this year it is time to adapt and rethink New Labour policy.\"</p> <p>Brown also described his determination to demonstrate he can provide the leadership required.</p> <p>\"What I ask of our country, our government, and our party, cannot be done without leadership.</p> <p>\"So, at conference in Manchester and in the weeks that follow, I will set out how I - and our party, and our government, and our country - must rise to conquer those challenges and to ensure fairness for all,\" he said.</p> <p>The prime minister also acknowledged that improvements in social mobility under Labour had not matched expectations and had to be stepped up.</p> <p>\"We need to be honest with ourselves: while poverty has been reduced and the rise in inequality halted, social mobility has not improved in Britain as we would have wanted,\" he said.</p> <p>\"A child's social class background at birth is still the best predictor of how well he or she will do at school and later on in life.</p> <p>\"Our ambitions for a fairer Britain cannot be satisfied in the face of these injustices.\"</p>",
  "<p>George Bush will argue today that the withdrawal of 8,000 troops from Iraq is testament to the success of US strategy in Iraq, particularly his decision \u2014 in the face of widespread opposition \u2014 to launch last year's \"military surge\".</p> <p>The surge that began early last year has led to a big drop in sectarian violence, although Bob Woodward in his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/05/usforeignpolicy.usa\">new book</a> cites other contributing factors: the decision by the Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr to rein in his Mahdi army militias; the so-called Anbar Awakening, in which Sunni fighters allied themselves with US forces to fight against al-Qaida, and an assassination campaign against extremist leaders.</p> <p>But a reduction of 8,000 troops over the next few months will still leave US troop levels in Iraq at about 140,000, posing a big problem for Bush's successor. </p> <p>In fact, the pace of the reduction in combat troops is both slower and smaller than had been anticipated. US commanders see little alternative to keeping a big troop presence in Iraq for now because the situation remains fragile, although Baghdad has made it clear in current talks on a security pact that it would like all US combat forces to leave by 2011.</p> <p>Some strategists, notably Fred Kagan \u2014 one of the advocates of the surge \u2014 have argued that this is no time to ease military pressure on al-Qaida and the Shia militias. In a recent article <a href=\"http://www.aei.org/publications/filter.all,pubID.28324/pub_detail.asp\">Kagan wrote</a>: \"Now is exactly the time to continue the pressure to keep them from regaining their equilibrium. It need not, and probably will not, require large numbers of American casualties to keep this pressure on. But it will require a considerable number of American troops through 2009.\"</p> <p>He went on to argue that the US needed to maintain current levels through the Iraqi provincial elections later this year, and that consideration of force reductions made sense only after those elections and until the incoming commander in Iraq, General Ray Odierno, has assessed the new situation. </p> <p>Odierno is set to take over from General David Petraeus, who has been named to take over US central command, in charge of military operations in the Middle East, East Africa and Central Asia.</p> <p>Toby Dodge, an analyst at Queen Mary, University of London, said Bush's decision was a compromise between Petraeus and Admiral Michael Mullen, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff.</p> <p>He said: \"Petraeus wanted a slower withdrawal because he thinks the gains are reversible, while the other commanders wanted to shift troops to Afghanistan and to save the army from being broken, so Bush compromised between the two camps.\"</p> <p>Although the violence has dropped largely because of the surge, Dodge also believes the progress that has been achieved is clearly reversible. </p> <p>\"The Iraqi army is a work in progress and the police is still completely divided along sectarian lines.\"</p> <p>Kagan's pre-occupations are widely shared by US military commanders in Iraq, who are worried that violence may flare up during provincial elections \u2014 originally scheduled for this month but postponed after the failure of the Iraqi parliament to agree on a new electoral law. Iraq's parliament legislature must pass the law by the end of this month if elections are to take place this year. </p> <p>The law has been held up partly by disagreements among ethnic Kurds and other minorities about the unresolved status of the oil-rich city of Kirkuk. There is also concern over Iranian-backed Shia militias. US officials fear that many of the militia leaders, who have fled after a government spring offensive in Baghdad and Basra, may be just biding their time.</p> <p>The success of the Sunnis in the Anbar awakening poses its own problems. Until now, these volunteers \u2014 about 100,000 \u2014 have been paid by the Americans. But the Shia-dominated government of Nouri al-Maliki, the prime minister, has said it would take over payment and find them jobs. But these Sunni volunteers view Maliki with suspicion, especially following the arrest of several Sunni leaders. For all these reasons, the next several months are seen as crucial and the potential for slippage from past security gains is very real.</p> <p>So Bush has had to be cautious about reducing the US troop presence in Iraq. But there had to be some give because American forces are so stretched. For the US military the drawdown in Iraq will mean little respite as Bush will be sending 4,500 extra troops to Afghanistan, where Nato is having a hard time with an emboldened Taliban, which is not only exacting a heavy toll on western forces, but stepping up suicide attacks in neighbouring Pakistan.</p> <p>In his speech, to be delivered at the US National Defence University, Bush devotes plenty of attention to Afghanistan, evidence of how badly Nato's war effort is faring in this front on the \"global war on terror\". In the past three months more American soldiers have died in Afghanistan than in Iraq.</p> <p>\"Afghanistan's success is critical to the security of America and our partners in the free world. And for all the good work we have done in that country, it is clear we must do even more,\" he says in the text of the speech released last night.</p> <p>Current US deployments to Afghanistan include 14,000 troops that are part of a Nato force and an additional 19,000 under separate US command. As Bush shuffles American troops around, one thing remains certain: American forces are fully stretched and are likely to remain so well into next year.</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.segway.com/individual/models/i2.php\">Segway PT</a> (personal transporter) has the potential to do for personal transport what the mobile phone did for personal communication. It's a funny looking device, with two wheels side by side, handlebars in front of you, and an on/off button. When you switch it on, two huge gyroscopes power up beneath your feet, and keep the Segway upright and more stable than an ordinary bicycle.</p> <p>To move forward or back, you just lean, well, forward or back. To move left or right you simply move the handlebars accordingly. And that's it. The average training time required is 90 seconds. Yes, in one and a half minutes you'll be competent to use a Segway PT.</p> <p>It's range is 24 miles - good for most urban journeys, though I also use it in a rural area from village to village. And that's not all. With a top speed of 12.5mph, it's actually 5mph faster than the average speed of London traffic. The case to leave your car at home is therefore compelling. No wonder over 600 police forces around the world are already using them \u2013 it also triples the area a foot patrol can cover.</p> <p>Frustratingly, our Department for Transport seems unable to commit to their use in the UK. Why? Who knows. There's no clear logical or safety-related reason to oppose such sensible technology. It's proven to be safe and efficient in hundreds of cities and towns, and even at Heathrow airport!</p> <p>So, a simple request to the folk at the ministry: let's have some common sense please.

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/riotinto\">Rio Tinto</a>, one of Britain's most blue chip corporate names, has been thrown out of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/sovereignwealthfunds\">sovereign wealth fund</a>'s portfolio for allegedly subjecting it - potentially - to \"grossly unethical conduct\" through its involvement in the world's biggest gold mine.</p> <p>Norway's Ministry of Finance said today that it was selling off the \u00a3500m stake held in Rio Tinto by its Government Pension Fund - Global, commonly known as the \"oil fund\". </p> <p>Kristin Halvorsen, the Norwegian finance minister, said the problems with Rio Tinto, the world's second-largest iron ore miner, concerned a joint venture with Freeport McMoRan, a company excluded by the fund in 2006, at a mining operation in Indonesia. </p> <p>\"Exclusion of a company from the Fund reflects our unwillingness to run an unacceptable risk of contributing to grossly unethical conduct. The Council on Ethics has concluded that Rio Tinto is directly involved, through its participation in the Grasberg mine in Indonesia, in the severe environmental damage caused by that mining operation,\" she said.</p> <p>\"There are no indications to the effect that the company's practices will be changed in future, or that measures will be taken to significantly reduce damage to nature and the environment,\" she added in a formal statement posted on the website of the finance ministry in Oslo.</p> <p>The Grasberg complex is the biggest gold mine in the world, and the third biggest for copper. Last year, a study published by War on Want claimed that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/nov/20/mining.riotinto\">local people had suffered serious human rights and environmental abuses</a>.</p> <p>Rio Tinto joins a list of other British companies deemed too \"unethical\" including arms manufacturer BAE Systems, and support services group Serco which was removed from the fund last year due to its involvement in the UK's Atomic Weapons Establishment.</p> <p>A host of American companies have also been deemed off-limits including Asda's parent group, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/walmart\">Wal-Mart</a>, technology group Honeywell and defence company Lockhead Martin. </p> <p>Rio Tinto expressed frustration at the move by the Norwegians, saying it was long-recognised as a leader in the field of environmental consciousness and was not even the operator of the Grasberg mine which had anyway being given the green light by independent auditors.</p> <p>\"Our immediate response is one of surprise and disappointment,\" said Rio Tinto spokesman Nick Cobban in London. \"We have an exemplary record in environmental matters, world leading in fact, and they are given the very highest priority in everything we do.\" </p> <p>The finance ministry also said it had considered but rejected a recommendation from the fund's Council of Ethics to exclude biotech seed maker Monsanto. The government chose to keep its Monsanto shares and had worked within the company to bring about a \"significant reduction in the use of child labour\" in cotton seed production in India. </p> <p>\"The ministry of finance has therefore decided not to exclude Monsanto Co from the portfolio,\" it said. </p> <p>Halvorsen said the magnitude of the reduction in child labour was uncertain, but estimates put it at 90% in one Indian state and 70% in another. </p> <p>\"The Norwegian people's savings are making a difference for children,\" she said. </p> <p>No one at Monsanto was immediately available for comment. </p> <p>The Government Pension Fund - Global invests most of Norway's oil and gas revenues in foreign stocks and bonds to save for the future when the hydrocarbons run out.</p>",

But, after a \u00a310m investigation and trial lasting more than two years, the jury could not agree on the main allegation - that eight men planned to blow up seven airliners on their way to North America from Heathrow.</p> <p>The Crown Prosecution Service today said it had yet to decide whether to request a retrial and was involving police in its deliberations. It has until the end of the month to make a decision.</p> <p>What is clear, however, is that more evidence might have been gathered had Rashid Rauf, a man believed to have been a key figure in the alleged plot, not been arrested in Pakistan.</p> <p>His arrest on August 9 2006 came as a surprise to British police and intelligence officers involved in the surveillance of the alleged plotters in the UK. It is understood that Rauf was arrested at the request of US authorities, who wanted to strike as soon as they heard about the alleged plot.</p> <p>Rauf's arrest was unwelcome in London. The US action triggered arrests in Britain that were forced on the security and intelligence agencies sooner than they expected, or wanted.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article4710870.ece\">Writing in today's Times</a>, Peter Clarke, who retired as head of counter-terrorism command in 2008 and led the liquid bomb plot inquiry, said Rauf's arrest was \"not good news\" as officers were at a \"critical point\" in building a case against the plotters.</p> <p>He wrote that Scotland Yard decided in \"a matter of minutes\" that all 20 suspects had to be arrested to prevent them destroying evidence and fleeing or mounting \"a desperate attack\".</p> <p>Professor Michael Clarke, the director of the Royal United Services Institute, said that there was a \"different approach\" between counter-terrorism in the UK and the US, with the former focusing on establishing the strongest criminal case possible.</p> <p>\"For the British, the evidence will never be better than the night before the plot is sprung. For the Americans, when you see a plot you break it,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.</p> <p>He added that he was \"pretty sure\" that the US president, George Bush, discussed the matter with the then prime minister, Tony Blair. That may lend weight to the theory that Bush put pressure on the UK intelligence agencies to act swiftly.</p> <p>Officials familiar with the investigation made this clear to the Guardian today. They said that since the investigation was an international one, \"the situation was not entirely under our control\".</p> <p>They added that there was always a balance to be struck between intelligence officers wanting to pursue a surveillance operation and the overriding responsibility of the police to protect the public.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the whereabouts of Rauf are unknown. In December 2007, he escaped from police guards in Pakistan by slipping out of the back door of a mosque he had been allowed to pray in.</p>",
  "<p>More wet weather was predicted across Britain today as experts warned many areas were already saturated with rain.</p> <p>Scattered showers are expected across south-west England and Wales, while Scotland is forecast to experience heavy rain and wind.</p> <p>On Wednesday and Thursday a brief respite should see most of the country becoming fine, with heavy rain only expected across parts of Northern Ireland. But by Friday, much of England and Wales will again be hit by storms and further downpours.</p> <p>John Hammond, a spokesman from the Met Office, said: \"That's clearly not going to be very helpful given the large amount of rain we have already seen this month.</p> <p>\"It's an early prediction but arguably it's angling to be one of the wettest Septembers ever.\"</p> <p>So far, Britain's recent storms have already claimed the lives of six people. Yesterday, insurers said the cost of the cleanup could run into tens of millions of pounds.</p> <p>On Sunday, a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/09/flooding.weather\">three-year-old girl had a lucky escape</a> when her father saved her after being sucked into a storm drain. Leona Baxter was splashing in a puddle when she was swept into the hidden drain and pulled under a torrent of gushing water.</p> <p>Her 34-year-old father, Mark, a sergeant in the RAF, waded into the river Wear in Chester-le-Street, County Durham, and revived the youngster, who had stopped breathing.</p> <p>Others were less fortunate. Seventeen-year-old Louise Ferreira, from Thamesmead in south-east London, died when the 4x4 she was travelling in plunged into floodwater in a remote part of Powys, mid Wales on Friday.</p> <p>On the same day, engineer Alex Wright, 27, was surveying a trench in Stroud, Gloucester, when the mud walls around him collapsed and he was buried alive.</p> <p>Meanwhile, questions have emerged over flood defences after it was revealed plans for preventative measures were shelved in one of the worst-affected areas.</p> <p>Environment Agency proposals for the historic market town of Morpeth in Northumberland, where 1,000 properties were damaged and 400 residents evacuated, were put out to consultation but never implemented. Instead, residents found themselves issued with giant expanding pillows, designed to soak up water, which proved ineffective.</p> <p>Today, the historic Abbey in Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, which came to represent the severity of last year's floods, was once again surrounded by water.</p>",
  "<p>Russia said today its troops would stay in the breakaway Georgian provinces of Abkhazia and South Ossetia for a long time to come, a day after Moscow agreed to pull its forces out of other Georgian territory within the month. </p> <p>Yesterday's deal, between France's president, Nicolas Sarkozy, and his Russian counterpart, Dmitry Medvedev, specifically excluded Abkhazia and South Ossetia. </p> <p>The future of the two enclaves, which Moscow recognised as independent last month, will be discussed at an international conference in Geneva on October 15. </p> <p>But Russia's foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, said Russia's military presence in Abkhazia and South Ossetia was necessary in order to avert Georgian attempts to regain control. </p> <p>He said troops would remain for the foreseeable future, though he did not indicate how many soldiers would be based in the area. Russia would sign formal agreements with both regions on the extent of the military presence. </p> <p>Lavrov's comments will heighten tensions with Georgia, which regards South Ossetia and Abkhazia as inseparable parts of the country. </p> <p>In a cautious welcome to yesterday's deal, Georgia's president, Mikhail Saakashvili, reiterated his country's claim to the regions. The Russians, he said, \"should get the hell out of the territories they control\". </p> <p>Describing the deal as \"momentous\", Sarkozy said Moscow had agreed to scrap its checkpoints inside Georgia within a week and had promised to remove all forces from areas adjacent to South Ossetia and Abkhazia within a month. </p> <p>The agreement also envisaged the deployment of a 200-strong force of EU observers to Georgia by October 1, Sarkozy said. </p> <p>Sarkozy, the current EU president, led yesterday's negotiations, together with the European commission president, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, and the EU's foreign policy chief, Javier Solana. </p> <p>The deal appears to mark a major achievement for Sarkozy. He was criticised widely after Moscow failed to implement his previous, August 12 ceasefire agreement, which called on Russia to pull its troops out. </p> <p>\"All has not been resolved,\" Sarkozy said. \"We are aware of that. But what has been resolved has been considerable.\" Welcoming the deal, he added that both the EU and Russia had avoided \"a cold war that we don't need\". </p> <p>In a press conference yesterday afternoon, after four hours of talks, Medvedev made clear that Russia's withdrawal of forces depended on Georgia's signing a \"non-aggression pact\" with South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Medvedev said Russia would continue to provide \"military assistance\" to the breakaway provinces. </p> <p>However, in a sign of continuing tension with Russia, the US administration said it was cancelling a much-heralded civilian nuclear cooperation deal with Russia, which the US president, George Bush, sent to Congress for approval in May after two years of tough negotiations. </p> <p>The US secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, said in a statement yesterday: \"We make this decision with regret. Unfortunately, given the current environment, the time is not right for this agreement.\" </p> <p>Earlier, in Moscow, Medvedev bitterly criticised the US, which he said had encouraged Georgia's \"aggression\" against South Ossetia, as well as its attack on August 8. The US was also \"actively\" rearming Georgia, he claimed, adding that Russia would no longer accept a \"unipolar model\" of world affairs in which the US decided \"the rules of the game\". </p> <p>Asked whether the Kremlin planned to invade any more of its neighbours, Medvedev looked irritated. Referring to Georgia, he said: \"This is an individual situation. Everything else is just plots ... Some people are trying to look at Russia like the Soviet Union. Russia is different. But Russia needs to be taken into account.\" </p> <p>Assuming Russia fully withdraws its forces, talks could resume in October on an EU-Russia cooperation deal, Sarkozy said. EU countries suspended the talks last week in protest at Russia's actions in Georgia. </p> <p>According to Russia's Kommersant newspaper, Moscow plans to establish diplomatic relations with Abkhazia and South Ossetia today.</p>",
  "<p>Water. Not the first thing that comes to mind when you think of Zambia \u2013 it's a landlocked country, after all, with the nearest stretch of coast 1,000km away. But memories of my trip there are going to be dominated by it. From mist rising off glassy patches of river in the morning sun, to the noise and spray of Victoria Falls, there's one reason: the Zambezi.</p> <p>Lusaka, the country's unglamorous capital, may feel like a long way from the river that gives Zambia its name, but it's the best base for any traveller here. Six hours by road to the south-west lies Mosi-oa-Tunya (\"The smoke that thunders\" \u2013 the name for Victoria Falls in Lozi); three hours to the south-west are the altogether calmer delights of the lower Zambezi.</p> <p>I decide to head south-west first. My host, Katy, an adoptive Lusakan, is used to the Zambian roads, and in a 4x4 we set off for Kanyemba lodge for the weekend. The first 150km or so of road are extremely smooth. After that, it turns into a dirt track and we have to take a pontoon to cross the Kafue \u2013 the croc-infested tributary that gives us our first taste of river country. After a boneshaking half an hour or so, we're there \u2013 on the green banks of the Zambezi itself.</p> <p>It's vast \u2013 more than three times as wide as the Thames in central London \u2013 and separates Zambia from neighbouring Zimbabwe. We dump our bags in one of six thatched rondavels and walk down to the terrace. There, a motor boat awaits us. We climb aboard and sit in canvas chairs. Somehow bottles of beer have appeared in our hands. This is the life. </p> <p>The boat glides out across the river, making for the opposite bank. In between are reed-covered islands and sandbanks. Apart from the hum of the motor, the only sounds are the breeze in the grass and the odd exotic birdcall. After the past few days of airport waiting rooms and transfers, I finally feel as though I've arrived. One of our party spots the first big animal \u2013 we are on a kind of safari, after all \u2013 and it's a huge, mean-looking crocodile, about 10 metres away from us on the edge of one of the islets. Suddenly, it flicks itself into the river, the flash of its tail the last thing we see. There'll be no dangling of fingers in the water on this trip. </p> <p>On the sandy cliffs that form the Zimbabwean bank, emerald-green bee-eaters perch outside their nests. Herons, ibises, egrets, they're all here, and if I was a birdwatcher I would probably have already fainted with excitement. As it is, I'm content to watch the pods of hippos \u2013 there seem to be hundreds \u2013 and listen to them as they grunt to mark out their territory. There are also elephants, of course, which regularly swim to the islands in search of fresh vegetation. Because you're on the water, and not in danger of being charged, you can get much closer than on land. And the elephants don't seem to mind \u2013 they just carry on munching. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337260652\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2008/09/03/zambezi220.jpg\" alt=\"Along the Zambezi, Zambia\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Along the Zambezi. <br> Photograph: David Shariatmadari</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Shariatmadari</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After watching the sunset, followed by a spectacular moonrise, we return to the lodge in time for dinner, cooked by the chef, Eddison, before choosing our activities for the following day. From a choice of canoeing, walking safaris and village trips, we settle on an excursion to the lower Zambezi national park \u2013 an hour and a half downriver. That means an early start, but it gives us the chance to see the river at its most beautiful, as the first rays of sun warm the surface and send wisps of vapour into the still-freezing air. </p> <p>The park is sandwiched between the hills of the Zambezi escarpment and the river itself. It is home to lions, leopards and buffaloes as well as plenty of hippos, impala and baboons. There are elephants, too, but, sadly, the park managers are currently struggling to deal with a serious poaching problem. The night before our visit another had been shot. Between April and mid-July this year, 17 were killed in the park - the highest level of poaching in recent memory. The guides blame a surge in demand for ivory being used to supply the Chinese medicine trade. </p> <p>The next day we laze around before getting Riccardo, the Italian-Zambian owner of the lodge, to show us his latest project \u2013 the Kanyemba bushcamp, which (despite the name) is definitely aimed at the higher end of the market. It's located on an island that was once a holding place for captives in the Indian Ocean slave trade and, if you can put that grisly fact out of your mind, it's hard to imagine a more luxurious back-to-nature experience. The chalet we saw was like a treehouse with a five-star bedroom attached. There's even a bath and power shower with a view out over the reeds. </p> <p>After the stillness of the Lower Zambezi, next up is Victoria Falls, some 500km upstream. To get there you have to travel back to Lusaka (it would be nice to go by river, but one of the world's largest dams \u2013 the Kariba \u2013 blocks the way). After that it's an hour's flight or about six hours' coach drive to Livingstone, a town named in honour of the first European to set eyes on the falls 150 years ago. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337260653\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2008/09/03/falls220.jpg\" alt=\"Victoria Falls, Zambia\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Victoria Falls, Zambia.<br> Photograph: Corbis</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patrick Ward/Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Vic Falls is, of course, firmly on the tourist map and as a result there's a wider range of places to stay, from the backpacker hostel of choice, Fawlty Towers, to the five-star Royal Livingstone. The conventional wisdom says that the falls are better from the Zimbabwean side \u2013 here, again, the Zambezi forms the border between the two countries \u2013 but when you're right in front of the gigantic sheets of water, getting soaked and enjoying the sight of double rainbows, you're unlikely to feel short-changed. </p> <p>The remarkable thing about the falls is that, right until it tips over the edge, the Zambezi is still that calm, wide, island-dotted river. And then it plunges into a narrow gorge and changes character completely. To fully appreciate it, don't just walk along the ridge that faces the falls \u2013 go down to the \"boiling pot\" to see what happens when this huge body of water is forced into a channel only 50 metres wide. This is the roaring, white-water Zambezi, and there are no lazy hippos here. </p> <p>Back in Lusaka, I'm left to consider the relative merits of the two faces of this great river. The falls might be one of those see-before-you-die sights. I couldn't have visited Zambia and not gone. But the magic of Kanyemba was something totally unexpected, and for that reason, when it comes to watery experiences, the lower Zambezi wins hands down. </p> <h2>Getting there</h2> <p>Flights to London from Lusaka via Nairobi from \u00a3600, inc tax.<br>http://www.<a href=\"http://www.kenya-airways.com/home/\">kenya-airways.com/home/</a><br><a href=\"http://www.kanyemba.com/bushcamp/kanyembaislandbushcampeng.html\">Kanyemba Lodge</a> costs \u00a3166 per person per night including all meals and activities, with reduced rates for residents and last-minute deals.

  "<p>\"Cricket must be the only business,\" wrote the journalist Pat Gibson in 1975, \"where you can make more money in one day than you can in three.\" Today at 2pm we will discover which England players are to be given the chance to make more money in three hours than they can in an entire season. It is a measure of the way the game has changed that the squad to travel to Antigua for the $20m Twenty20 match on November 1 will create far more of a stir than the names to tour India or - even if Michael Vaughan is included - the recipients of a new batch of central contracts.</p> <p>Money talks - screams - in cricket like never before, and it has added an unprecedented frisson to the role of the England captain. If Kevin Pietersen has so far fretted over little more than how many overs to give Steve Harmison or whether to include Luke Wright at the expense of Ravi Bopara, he must now deal with the potentially divisive issue of the bottom line. A Sky Sports panel including Nasser Hussain recently picked its squad for Antigua and left out Ian Bell. That would mean an established England player missing out on a crack at over GBP560,000 (the plummeting pound raises the stakes by the day). And it would test Pietersen's much-trumpeted man-management skills to the full.</p> <p>Some may point out that Pietersen, rarely quiet on the subject of remuneration when he was in the rank and file, is reaping what he has sown. But to hold several chunks of silly cash in the palm of your hand is not one of the tasks any cricket captain expects when he takes the job. And although Pietersen will have no say in the squad, his views will count when the XI is selected in Antigua. As burdens go, it verges on the distasteful.</p> <p>This stance may be dismissed as bleeding-heart wishy-washiness in some quarters. Giles Clarke, the business-orientated chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board, makes no effort to disguise his glee at the gladiatorial nature of the contest, and Peter Moores - who will share $1m with his fellow back-room staffers should England win - has reminded us more than once that international cricket is a tough environment.</p> <p>It certainly is. But Allen Stanford's money has made it tougher in a different way. The selectors and Pietersen must now be utterly ruthless because the format leaves them no option. There can be no planning for the future, no experimenting with batting line-ups, no sentiment, no fun - all of which take place even in Test cricket. We will discover which players are considered the big-game cricketers and which the captain regards as flaky. We may, just may, see the emergence of rifts that cannot be repaired. As long ago as May, Vaughan denied agitating behind the scenes over a share of the spoils for Test players. Imagine what the tension must be like now.</p> <p>While Vaughan was playing down rumours of his own irritation, Moores was busy formulating an acid test: \"If it's deemed to be unfair,\" he said, referring to the distribution of the Stanford wonga, \"it'll cause its own dramas.\" Yet the unique nature of this glorified circus-act means that the definition of what is fair or not is very much up for grabs. Will Ryan Sidebottom regard it as fair if his efforts over the past year, in part responsible for preventing England from bombing completely in New Zealand, are ignored? Will it be fair if Graham Napier waltzes in for an England debut, thus providing a graphic twist to the words of the senior pro who told Mike Atherton on his Test debut that you play your first game for love and the rest for money?</p> <p>Cash squabbles have always played their part in the life of the professional cricketer. Pure greed causes problems of its own. Whoever makes the squad this afternoon, Pietersen's responsibilities are about to move onto a whole new level.</p> <p><em>Extract taken from <a href=\"http://sport.guardian.co.uk/thespin/0,,806133,00.html\">the Spin</a>, guardian.co.uk/sport's weekly take on the world of cricket.

  "<p>With the depressing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/flooding\">torrential rain</a> and flooding at the weekend, water shortages are the last thing on our minds here in these wet, northern climes. In fact, perhaps we need a collective \"sun dance\" to implore the powers that be to deliver us an \"Indian summer\". </p> <p>Despite the misery, we are fortunate, as more and more areas in the world are beset by water shortages. Over the past week alone, the <a href=\"http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2008%5C09%5C05%5Cstory_5-9-2008_pg11_3\">water table</a> in the Pakistani capital, Islamabad, has fallen to dangerous levels (a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/30/world/asia/30water2.html\">common problem</a> across the subcontinent), Kyrgyzstan has <a href=\"http://www.cacianalyst.org/?q=node/4931/print\">cut electricity production</a> to save water, and Californian farmers <a href=\"http://www.centralvalleybusinesstimes.com/stories/001/?ID=9720\">have complained</a> of lower yields due to water rationing.</p> <p>The Middle East and North Africa, the driest population centre on the planet, is particularly vulnerable to water shortages. According to the International Water Management Institute, every country in the MENA region suffers from physical <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/21_08_06_world_water_week.pdf\">water scarcity</a> or is approaching it.</p> <p>Yemen \u2013 fabled for the fertile <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_history_of_Yemen\">ancient kingdoms</a> of Arabia Felix \u2013 is expected to be the <a href=\"http://www.uaedailynews.com/middleeast/650.html\">first country</a> in the region to deplete its ground water. </p> <p>The Sea of Galilee in Israel has reached the <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/main.jhtml?xml=/earth/2008/08/29/eaisrael129.xml\">lowest levels</a> ever recorded, with fears that, if the government continues to pump it at current rates, the country's main fresh water reservoir could reach the point of no return. </p> <p>And the situation is likely to deteriorate if climate change models prove to be accurate. Earlier this year, the UN released a report estimating that a 3\u00b0-4\u00b0C rise in temperatures could lead to <a href=\"http://www.scidev.net/en/news/un-climate-danger-for-middle-east-north-africa.html\">a drop</a> of up to 35% in agricultural output. However, more <a href=\"http://www.scidev.net/en/middle-east-and-north-africa/news/middle-east-climate-predictions-less-certain-.html\">localised analysis</a> by Australian scientists suggests that some parts of the region, such as Iraq, may see more rainfall.</p> <p>Nevertheless, the forecast looks dry for the Middle East. But lack of rain is not the real problem, according to <a href=\"http://portal.surrey.ac.uk/portal/page?_pageid=822,512805&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL\">Jonathan Chenoweth</a> of the Centre for Environmental Strategy. \"I believe the looming water crisis is primarily a problem of distribution and management rather than supply,\" he <a href=\"http://environment.newscientist.com/channel/earth/mg19926700.100-looming-water-crisis-simply-a-management-problem.html\">wrote</a> in a recent New Scientist article. </p> <p>In addition to water efficiency and desalination technologies, the major pillar of his strategy would be for arid and semi-arid countries to import \"<a href=\"http://www.worldwatercouncil.org/index.php?id=866\">virtual water</a>\" in the form of food because agriculture consumes some 90% of water supplies. These countries would shift to less water-intensive sectors, such as trade and services. </p> <p>Although largely unspoken, this is the direction in which the Middle East has been heading for decades. In fact, the term virtual water was probably <a href=\"http://www.al-bab.com/arab/env/liquidassets.htm\">coined</a> by Tony Allan of SOAS in reference to the region. Without it, the region may have suffered severe famines by now. For instance, Egypt, with some of the most productive land in the world, imports more than half of its food owing to water shortages and population growth.</p> <p>Soon-to-be-published research carried out by Chenoweth suggests that \"by importing virtual water, a country could offer a high quality of life with as little as 135 litres of water per person per day\".</p> <p>While this theory is promising at certain levels, it seems to overlook some crucial issues. While the more developed Middle Eastern countries with a smaller population, such as Israel, Lebanon and Dubai are successfully shifting their economies towards trade and service, it is difficult to see how many others will be able to reduce their economic dependence on agriculture and manufacturing. </p> <p>Egypt, for instance, has a large educated population and its economy has a robust and rapidly growing service sector, including IT. Nevertheless, agriculture accounts for 14% of the country's GDP and employs a quarter of the labour force. In addition, cash crops and cotton textiles and clothes are among Egypt's main exports. Moreover, other large sectors of the economy, such as steel, manufacturing and chemicals are heavy water users.</p> <p>If Egypt, a middle income, relatively developed country has such difficulty shifting its economy towards water-light sectors, what of less-developed countries? Sudan, for instance, overall has abundant water supplies, yet it is unable even to meet food shortages within its own border. The situation is even worse in Ethiopia where I personally witnessed UN food aid being distributed only miles away from the source of the Blue Nile, Lake Tana.</p> <p>What Chenoweth's analysis also seems to overlook or understate is that water-rich regions may have an abundance of water but they are already sailing pretty close to the wind in terms of food output. While growth in Middle Eastern agriculture is crippled by the absence of water, it is highly unlikely that largely temperate regions, such as the EU, will be able to translate their water abundance into significantly higher agricultural production, since most of their arable land is already in use. </p> <p>The current food crisis may be an early indication that we are slowly approaching an agricultural ceiling. In addition, the energy crunch suggests that the kind of globalisation of trade required to shift virtual water effectively may be unsustainable.</p> <p>Then, there's the issue of food security. How can countries dependent on virtual water ensure a sufficient flow of food to sustain their populations? What if a more severe crisis in the future forces major food exporters to cut off exports? Alternatively, if wealthy and arid countries, such as the <a href=\"http://www.menafn.com/qn_news_story_s.asp?StoryId=1093211103\">Gulf states</a>, buy up large tracts of farm land in poor countries to ensure their food security, this will help these countries to boost their agricultural output and develop their economies. But we could also be looking at future artificial famines rather like the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Irish_Famine#Food_exports_to_England\">Irish potato famine</a> which, interestingly, <a ref=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Irish_Famine#Ottoman_humanitarian_aid_during_the_Great_Famine\">prompted</a> the Ottoman sultan and native Americans to send humanitarian aid to Ireland.</p> <p>If virtual water is to be successful in feeding the world, we need robust and effective international mechanisms to ensure that this redistribution is implemented equitably and that neither suppliers nor recipients go hungry in lean years. In addition, development programmes in poorer arid countries will need to find ways of reducing dependence on sparse local water resources and controlling population growth.</p>",

  "<p>Output from Britain's factories fell for the fifth month in a row in July, the longest run of decline for seven years and one which will renew calls for cuts in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/interestrates\">interest rates</a>.</p> <p>The Office for National Statistics said manufacturing output fell 0.2% from June to stand 1.4% lower on the year. That was a bigger drop than City pundits had expected.</p> <p>In the latest three months to July, production fell 1.1% from the previous three months, the worst figure since November 2005 while the year-on-year fall of 1.7% was the weakest since May 2003.</p> <p>\"There seems little doubt that the manufacturing sector is now in recession, with output set to contract in the third quarter after plunging 0.8% in the second quarter. Manufacturers are now being hit hard by muted domestic demand, weakening activity in key export markets, elevated energy and commodity prices, and tight credit conditions,\" said Howard Archer, economist at Global Insight.</p> <p>The wider measure of industrial production, which includes North Sea oil and gas production as well as utility sales of electricity, also fell more than expected in July, by 0.4%, taking output down 1.9% year-on-year.</p> <p>Part of that drop, though, was down to routine maintenance work on rigs lowering oil and gas extraction output. </p> <p>The figures came hot on the heels of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/09/economics.retail\">weak shop sales figures from the British Retail Consortium (BRC)</a> and the lowest property transactions figures ever recorded by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.</p> <p>\"Markedly contracting industrial production in July, following on from a weak BRC survey for August, reinforces belief that the economy will contract in the third quarter and is well on its way into recession. We believe that the Bank of England could well respond by cutting interest rates from 5% to 4.75% in November,\" said Archer.</p>",
  "<p>The UK government should develop a comprehensive set of standards covering all aspects of the impact our food has on the environment and society, according to an influential food policy adviser.</p> <p>Prof Tim Lang, who coined the term \"food miles\" and is an adviser to the cabinet office, said that consumers are baffled by conflicting advice about food. He said the government should set up an independent body of experts to integrate information on all aspects of food's impact, including how healthy it is, its environmental effects and the social consequences of the way it is produced.</p> <p>This could be translated into easily accessible information on food labels for consumers such as \"food flowers\" in which each petal indicates a food's impact in a different area.</p> <p>He acknowledged that this would be an extremely complex task, but said that consumers wanted reliable information. \"The classical approach to this is to let prices and the consumer decide. But health and environment, justice and equity are all surely reasonable and decent aspirations,\" Lang told the <a href=\"http://www.the-ba.net/the-ba/FestivalofScience/\">British Association Festival of Science</a> in Liverpool, \"We need a food system to improve standards across a variety of equally important fronts.\"</p> <p>He hoped that his proposed \"omni-standards\" would help consumers to navigate contradictory information. For example, the nutritional evidence for eating fish is very strong and the government advocates eating two portions of fish a week. However fish stocks are in crisis and overfishing is having a significant ecological impact. \"Which evidence do I listen to and shape my behaviour by?\" he said.</p> <p>Similarly, green beans from Kenya are good for you and if they are Fair Trade they may help the local economy where they are grown. However, he said each green bean stem has 4 litres of embedded water and they must be transported thousands of miles.</p> <p>Lang said that at present, scientists and NGOs often focussed on only one part of the problem. \"Actually we are part of the problem. We've got to come together and start piecing information together,\" he said.</p> <p>Communicating the information to consumers will not be easy, but he said packaging could have basic data in the form of a graphical representation of a food's social, health and environmental footprint. More information could be made available via interactive screens in the supermarket or online.</p> <p>Lang acknowledged that the practicalities of putting together a panel of experts to formulate the standards would be fraught with difficulty. One issue would be whether NGOs should be included directly. </p> <p>\"If I was off the record and there weren't microphones here I would say something more interesting,\" he said. </p> <p>\"I think there are very interesting tensions within government I will say very tightly \u2013 very interesting nuances between the various departmental chief scientists of their various positions.\"</p>",

  "<p>I may not agree with a word they say, but I sincerely hope that the <a href=\"http://blogs.iht.com/tribtalk/business/green/?p=192\">six Greenpeace protesters</a> accused of causing criminal damage to Kingsnorth power station in Kent are found not guilty. The six are on trial at Maidstone Crown Court for causing \u00a330,000 of damage after they daubed the word \"Gordon\" on a smokestack chimney (they had planned to write \"Gordon, bin it\", but were arrested before they could finish the job). The right to protest has taken quite enough of a battering under New Labour without some forms of protest now being recast as \"criminal damage\".</p> <p>However, I am perturbed by the justifications put forward by the protesters for their paint-protesting antics. Instead of defending themselves on the basis that they, like the rest of us, should have the right to protest as loudly and spectacularly as they please, they have used scientific fact to defend their actions. Their defence team has pushed forward <a href=\"http://www.businessgreen.com/business-green/news/2225363/nasa-scientist-defends \">a scientist</a> and even <a href=\"http://www.medwaymessenger.co.uk/news/default.asp?article_id=47512\">an Inuit</a> to argue that the \"criminal damage\" at Kingsnorth was justified, scientifically, in order to prevent even greater damage being done to the environment by Kingsnorth's smoggy chimneys.</p> <p>This could set a dangerous precedent. In defending the protest in such narrow terms, Greenpeace is killing the spirit of political protest and possibly limiting the scope of demonstration in the future. The Kingsnorth demo represents a worrying shift from protest based on political ideals, which represent real people's interests, to protests carried out in the name of Science. This was no democratic protest springing from a desire to engage with and persuade the public, but rather a form of elite action, sanctioned by the findings of scientists. It was more akin to a religious demonstration executed by true believers in the gospel truth of global warming, than a protest built on passion or political conviction.</p> <p>This changes the nature of protest. In the past, protest involved fighting in public to try to establish the truth. In my teen years and my 20s, I went on more loud and rowdy protests than I care to remember, from opposing police racism in east London in 1993 to challenging the Nato bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999. And every protest involved having lively debates with fellow marchers, having political run-ins with members of the public, and, of course, fighting tooth and catapult against mainstream \"truths\" about war, racism and other big issues in order to establish the real truth \u2013 as we understood it \u2013 about world events.</p> <p>By contrast, protest driven by scientific fact is about imposing an elite, already established \"Truth\", as discovered by scientists in laboratories, on to public debate. It has no time for true and meaningful engagement with the public, but rather is about arrogantly hailing The Truth from on high \u2013 from on top of a smokestack in the case of the six Greenpeace protesters, where, like Moses on Mount Sinai, they declared the climate change commandments. </p> <p>And because they claim to represent \"the future of the planet\" or \"future generations\" or even \"the biosphere\", these new protesters don't have to worry about engaging with the living, breathing, messy, awkward mass of the population. In the past, we tried to make our protests as populous as possible, on the basis that the more people we had the more powerful we were. Today's green protests get their power from scientific fact rather than from an engaged, agitated throng; they demonstrate on behalf of the planet rather than in the name of a convinced public. Thus their protests can appear aloof and elitist, the very opposite of democratic engagement.</p> <p>If scientific fact becomes the measuring stick of protest, a key justification for political action, then some forms of protest will be implicitly delegitimised. At a time when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/jun/14/greenxenophobes \">some leading greens</a> claim there is scientific evidence that immigration leaves an ugly \"carbon footprint\", what will happen to those of those who want to protest for open borders and utterly free migration? What if we want to demand industrialisation in the Third World in order to increase material equality across the globe? Would such a protest be \"unscientific\", and thus illegitimate?</p> <p>The right to protest is important precisely because it allows the public to take ideas seriously, to have heated debates about the best way forward for a certain workplace, local community or for society itself, and to act on those ideas in the public realm, either by marching peacefully or fighting angrily. New Labour would like to disarm us of this right; it is also being inadvertently degraded by the new caste of Truth-wielding, greener-than-thou protesters who seem to think themselves above us rather than with us.</p>",
