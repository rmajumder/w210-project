  "<p>Getting Americans to leave home is like getting treacle to run uphill. So the arrival of nearly 5,000 diehards from San Diego and New Orleans in London this week to support the Saints or the Chargers at Wembley on Sunday would, on the face of it, appear to support the view that sport really is going global in a major way. </p> <p>I'm not sure. While their support looks to be an act of faith on a par with believing Sarah Palin is not a moose-murdering wind-up doll, 5,000 is hardly an invasion.</p> <p>Their game travels, their fans don't. </p> <p>Sports of all kinds are looking to expand outside their saturated home base, from football's 39th game to the tentative take-up here of American basketball, to the low-key marketing of cricket in the United States and Canada. But administrators from all corners of the sporting world arriving in London for a gabfest on Friday might like to consider this: what is it they are selling and to whom? </p> <p>Because, for all the attractions of American football, not to mention the basketball that lit up London's O2 Arena last weekend, the invention of the Indian Premier League and the prospect of cricketers earning $1m each in Antigua in two weeks, there is no substitute for the integrity of a sporting event or the context in which it is played. </p> <p>That comes with history and tradition. You can't invent it. Which is why next Sunday's NFL game, although a 'real' fixture, is still an imported oddity. It is real for the fans from San Diego and New Orleans, not quite as significant for the sport's enthusiasts from Brighton and Birmingham. </p> <p>The NFL, having seen the extraordinary local response in Britain to the 'real thing' for the second year in a row, might have been misled. They will reckon it a worthwhile exercise and will believe there is a still considerable market here for their product. They point out they could have sold out Wembley five or six times over so, notionally, if you had a stadium big enough, that's an audience of, say, 630,000, and a lot of hot dogs and fancy shirts. </p> <p>But, believe me, whatever the audience - live and on television - this game won't cause an earthquake in sport. It will not persuade the majority of us to suddenly embrace the NFL to the exclusion of life-long interests. It should be viewed for what it is: a nice day out. </p> <p>True, the visitors will be joined by 85,000 locals, a few of them fanatics, a lot of them bi-curious football fans who quite like the occasional game of 'gridiron'. And many of these newbies will go back to their laptops and satellite subscriptions and follow the fortunes of their adopted NFL teams with the enthusiasm they once devoted to their stamp collections. </p> <p>But, be honest, on Monday, most of us will have forgotten about it. Eyes will return to the Premier League, or the upcoming fights of Joe Calzaghe and Ricky Hatton, the Heineken rugby, Andy Murray's ankle, Monty Panesar's arm-ball. </p> <p>I 'quite like' American football. I enjoyed seeing a couple of the NBA play-off games in Boston not long ago. But, like 99 per cent of people in this country (bar a few sportswriters who, around Super Bowl time, exhibit a knowledge of quarterbacks, wide receivers and yardage that remains hidden from their associates the rest of the year), I can't pretend to follow those sports with anywhere near the intensity I do cricket, rugby, boxing and football. </p> <p>And where do these polymathic sports nuts get the time? Surely they've got books to read, films to see, hills to walk, University Challenge to watch, mortgages to worry about, friends to entertain, anniversaries to remember, wives to apologise to, beers to drink, political arguments to have, newspapers to read - and columnists to ignore. </p> <p>I suspect the sort of passion most of us connect with is that which springs from being disappointed by a football team for 40 years. I got mine from reading every cricket book in my local library before I was big enough to fit into my father's pads, and from listening to Sonny Liston knocking out Floyd Patterson on the radio with him. And watching the Barbarians do amazing things against the All Blacks. </p> <p>Real passion, as opposed to the confection being gift-wrapped at Wembley on Sunday, is 50,000 rugby supporters ringing Thomas Cook for packages on the Lions tour to South Africa next June. It is the 10,000 or so expected in New York next month to watch Calzaghe and Roy Jones Jr at Madison Square Garden; and the 20,000 or so who will follow Hatton to Las Vegas a couple of weeks later. And then there are the kings of fandom, cricket's Barmy Army. </p> <p>What is significant about these phenomenal numbers is that they are holding up at the very time other sports are competing for money that is becoming increasingly scarce and in a marketplace that we are told is being opened up. </p> <p>British fans of British sports are still the most loyal in the world. They might be tempted to stray now and again, but they always find themselves coming home.</p>",
  "<p>Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the French economist who heads the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/imf\">International Monetary Fund</a>, is under investigation for allegedly abusing his position by engaging in a sexual relationship with a senior official.</p> <p>The inquiry, confirmed by an IMF spokesman, threatens to distract the organisation at a time when it is trying to focus its efforts on helping countries to withstand the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/creditcrunch\">global financial crisis</a>.</p> <p>Yesterday US President George Bush held talks with European leaders amid growing evidence that the world is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/globaleconomy\">sliding towards recession</a>.</p> <p>French officials and politicians reacted angrily to the Strauss-Kahn story, which appeared in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/wallstreetjournal\">Wall Street Journal</a>, accusing the US administration of 'playing dirty' by 'at the very least' pointing reporters to the IMF internal inquiry.</p> <p>According to the newspaper, Strauss-Kahn had an affair with Piroska Nagy, a senior official in the fund's Africa department who was brought up in Hungary. The affair reportedly ended after her husband, Mario Blejer, a prominent economist and former president of Argentina's central bank, discovered incriminating emails. </p> <p>Nagy then left the IMF and part of the inquiry centres on the possibility that she may have received an excessive payout for a person of her position.</p> <p>Masood Ahmed, the IMF's chief spokesman, said: 'There was an allegation concerning improper behaviour of a personal nature on the part of the managing director. All allegations, particularly relating to senior management, need to be investigated.' But the handling of the investigation has drawn criticism from the IMF because not all board members were informed about it before the newspaper made its inquiries. </p> <p>There was also anger in Europe. 'It's very odd that it comes just at the moment when people are talking about the IMF and its head taking a lead role in creating a new global financial order which will not necessarily be to the advantage of wealthy, right-wing Americans,' one French economist and government adviser told The Observer</p> <p>Strauss-Kahn, a former finance minister, is a leading member of the French Socialist party and is known for his moderate left-wing views. In a statement on Friday he said the 'incident which occurred in [his] private life' took place in January 2008 and that 'at no time did [he] abuse [his] position as the fund's managing director'.</p> <p>This is the second time that a major international financial institution has been hit by scandal in recent years. In June last year the then World Bank president Paul Wolfowitz, one of Bush's closest allies, stepped down following a scandal over a promotion and pay rise for his long-term companion who worked at the institution.</p> <p>At yesterday's meeting with Bush, French President Nicolas Sarkozy and European Commission president Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso hoped to pave the way for an unprecedented summit this autumn to overhaul the global financial regulatory system. In France, as elsewhere in continental Europe, there have been strident calls for a fundamental reform of 'liberal laissez-faire capitalism' in recent days.</p> <p>Sarkozy has attacked tax havens, hedge and sovereign wealth funds and big pay bonuses for risk-taking executives, as well as the American dominance of ratings agencies. However, Bush and many close aides are not convinced about the need for fundamental reform. </p> <p>'Our European partners are taking bold steps. They show the world that we're determined to overcome this challenge together. And they have the full support of the United States,' Bush said during a speech at the US Chamber of Commerce last week.</p> <p>However, the President, who leaves office in January, did not specifically mention calls by European leaders to reform the Bretton Woods financial system under which the world has operated since 1944. White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said that the US focus was on the immediate crisis. 'I think the most important thing we can do is ... stop the bleeding before we move on to the next project,' she said.</p> <p>Barroso and Sarkozy met Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper on Friday and agreed on the need for an international summit to forge a new vision for the world economy before the end of the year. Gordon Brown has already said he would back such a plan.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/banking\">Banks</a> will face new curbs on home <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/repossessions\">repossessions</a> to prevent families from being evicted when they fall into financial difficulties, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury has promised.</p> <p>The pledge was made by Yvette Cooper in an interview with The Observer as the government braces itself this week for official confirmation that Britain is entering recession for the first time since the early Nineties. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/unemploymentdata\">Rising unemployment</a> is expected to trigger a wave of mortgage defaults as people who lose their jobs find themselves unable to keep up payments on their homes. Repossessions have already increased to 19,000 in the first half of this year - a 40 per cent increase on the previous six months. Experts believe the figure will climb to 26,000 in the second half of 2008. The total number of people suffering negative equity is expected to rise to around two million as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/houseprices\">house prices</a> plunge.</p> <p>Ministers believe that after pumping billions of pounds of public money into rescuing banks, taxpayers will expect greater leniency from their lenders when they struggle to meet mortgage payments. 'We need a more responsible approach to repossessions,' Cooper said in the interview. 'What we are looking at is something looking much more widely at all of the banks, because I think repossession needs to be lot rarer. We need to do everything that we can to keep people in their own homes.'</p> <p>However, with figures this week expected to show Britain's economy shrinking over the last quarter - the first of what is widely expected to be the two quarters of negative growth required to confirm a recession - Cooper warned that the government could not stop the economic tide. </p> <p>'It's clearly going to be tougher times ahead. I don't think any government can prevent economic slowdown, faced with the kind of global problems that we have had,' she said. 'What we can do is step in and, by dealing with the problems in the banking system, prevent the worst of the credit squeeze hitting people.'</p> <p>Her words reflect a battle that is developing between Labour and the Tories over how to tackle problems in the real economy that are now squeezing ordinary Britons.</p> <p>There were signs last night that Labour, more than the Tories, is benefiting from the crisis: a survey published today for the political website <a href=\"http://www.politicshome.com\">Politicshome.com</a> shows the Prime Minister's popularity ratings bouncing back to the levels he last enjoyed in April, before the summer's leadership doubts. And a separate ComRes survey for today's Independent on Sunday shows the Conservative lead has been cut to just nine points - the smallest gap between the parties since last March. </p> <p>Seeking to stop Brown's 'bounce', Tory leader David Cameron has called today for new measures to keep people in jobs, including a VAT holiday for small businesses, which would enable them to defer paying tax bills for up to six months, and putting pressure on councils to pay what they owe to small businesses faster.</p> <p>Writing in The Observer, Cameron adds: 'We intervened to prevent the beating heart of our economy - the financial system - from collapsing. We've got to do the same for its lifeblood. Small and medium-sized businesses employ over 13 million people and turn over \u00a31,440bn a year.' The Tories will unveil further measures on jobs and homes, amid fears their consensus agreement with Labour over the banking crisis has left them sidelined. </p> <p>But as President George Bush confirmed last night he would convene a summit of world leaders to address the economic crisis, following lobbying from EU leaders, Chancellor Alistair Darling sought to reinforce the message that Labour would help hard-working families through the looming recession.</p> <p>He told the Sunday Telegraph: 'You will see us switching our spending priorities to areas which make a difference.' Areas that could benefit include housing, energy and small businesses. Capital projects, including two new aircraft carriers, as well as London's \u00a316bn Crossrail transport project, would go ahead. </p> <p>The spotlight will fall on homeowners this week with the publication of a report commissioned by housing ministers on private renting. Academic Julie Rugg's study is expected to highlight concerns over the buy-to-let bubble, and show how landlords of multiple properties are now falling behind on payments, potentially impacting tenants, forcing them to move.</p>",
  "<p>After being accused of precipitating the present financial crisis by short-selling banks, hedge funds are now turning their attention to student loans.</p> <p>Jim Chanos, founder and president of Kynikos, one of the best known short- selling hedge funds in the US, has student loan companies high on his list to short for the foreseeable future.</p> <p>'This industry has much in common with the sub-prime mortgage industry,' Chanos said. 'Things do not look very bright.'</p> <p>They don't. More than two-thirds of American university students rely on loans to pay for college, but loan applications are being turned down in record numbers as the near collapse of the credit market is making all but the most secure loans impossible to write.</p> <p>More than 137 lenders that participate in a US government-backed student loan programme have been forced to suspend operations in recent weeks as the wheels of the global credit market have ground to a halt. Another 33 companies have stopped issuing loans to students at private universities.</p> <p>As a consequence, applications for government student aid have soared in recent weeks, according to data from the US Department of Education, as more and more students are finding it hard to make ends meet. </p> <p>Applications for Federal Student Aid are up 17 per cent to nine million students this academic year, 1.3 million more than last year.</p> <p>David Wyss, chief economist at Standard &amp; Poor's in New York, said the financial situation for many US students is dire. 'There are two reasons this has gone bad. Firstly, of course, the financial markets have locked up. But also there have been some changes to the law which make the provision of student loans a lot less attractive to lenders.'</p> <p>Almost a year ago, the US Congress axed a $21bn subsidy package to student loan companies, making it harder for them to turn a profit.</p>",
  "<p>Every so often, a famous actor or producer will contact Seymour Hersh, wanting to make a movie about his most famous story: his single-handed uncovering, in 1969, of the My Lai massacre, in which an American platoon stormed a village in South Vietnam and, finding only its elderly, women and children, launched into a frenzy of shooting, stabbing and gang-raping. It won him a Pulitzer prize and hastened the end of the Vietnam war. Mostly, they come to see him in his office in downtown Washington, a two-room suite that he has occupied for the past 17 years. Do they like what they see? You bet they do, even if the movie has yet to be made. 'Brad Pitt loved this place,' says Hersh with a wolfish grin. 'It totally fits the clich\u00e9 of the grungy reporter's den!' When last he renewed the lease, he tells me, he made it a condition of signing that the office would not be redecorated - the idea of moving all his stuff was too much. It's not hard to see why. Slowly, I move my head through 180 degrees, trying not to panic at the sight of so much paper piled so precipitously. Before me are 8,000 legal notepads, or so it seems, each one filled with a Biro Cuneiform of scribbled telephone numbers. By the time I look at Hersh again - the full panorama takes a moment or two - he is silently examining the wall behind his desk, which is grey with grime, and striated as if a billy goat had sharpened its horns on it.</p> <p>And then there is Hersh himself, a splendid sight. After My Lai, he was hired by the New York Times to chase the tail of the Watergate scandal, a story broken by its rival, the Washington Post. In All the President's Men, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein's book about their scoop, they describe him - the competition. He was unlike any reporter they'd ever seen: 'Hersh, horn-rimmed and somewhat pudgy, showed up for dinner in old tennis shoes, a frayed pinstriped shirt that might have been at its best in his college freshman year and rumpled, bleached khakis.' Forty years on, little has changed. Today he is in trainers, chinos and a baggy navy sweatshirt and - thanks to a tennis injury - he is walking like an old guy: chest forward, knees bandy, slight limp in one leg. There is something cherishably chaotic about him. A fuzzy halo of frantic inquiry follows him wherever he goes, like the cloud of dust that hovers above Pig Pen in the Charlie Brown strip. In conversation, away from the restraining hand of his bosses at the New Yorker, the magazine that is now his home, his thoughts pour forth, unmediated and - unless you concentrate very hard - seemingly unconnected. 'Yeah, I shoot my mouth off,' he says, with faux remorse. 'There's a huge difference between writing and thinking.' Not that he has much time for those who put cosy pontification over the graft of reporting: 'I think... My colleagues! I watch 'em on TV, and every sentence begins with the words: \"I think.\" They could write a book called I Think.'</p> <p>But we must backtrack a little. Before the office, there is the breakfast joint. Hersh and I meet at the Tabard Inn, a Washington hangout so gloomily lit I could do with a torch. He has poached eggs and coffee and 'none of that other stuff, thanks'. (I think he means that he doesn't want potatoes with his eggs). Like everyone in America just now, he is on tenterhooks. A Democrat who truly despises the Bush regime, he is reluctant to make predictions about exactly what is going to happen in the forthcoming election on the grounds that he might 'jinx it'. The unknown quantity of voter racism apart, however, he is hopeful that Obama will pull it off, and if he does, for Hersh this will be a starting gun. 'You cannot believe how many people have told me to call them on 20 January [the date of the next president's inauguration],' he says, with relish. '[They say:] \"You wanna know about abuses and violations? Call me then.\" So that is what I'll do, so long as nothing awful happens before the inauguration.' He plans to write a book about the neocons and, though it won't change anything - 'They've got away with it, categorically; anyone who talks about prosecuting Bush and Cheney [for war crimes] is kidding themselves' - it will reveal how the White House 'set out to sabotage the system... It wasn't that they found ways to manipulate Congressional oversight; they had conversations about ending the right of Congress to intervene.'</p> <p>In one way, it's amazing Hersh has anything left to say about Bush, Cheney and their antics. Then again, with him, this pushing of a story on and on is standard practice. Though it was Woodward and Bernstein who uncovered the significance of the burglary at the Watergate building, Hersh followed up their scoop by becoming one of Nixon's harshest critics and by breaking stories about how the government had supported Pinochet's 1973 coup in Chile, secretly bombed Cambodia and used the CIA to spy on its domestic enemies. His 1983 book about Nixon, The Price of Power, is definitive. So far as the War on Terror goes, Hersh has already delivered his alternative history - Chain of Command, a book based on the series of stories he wrote for the New Yorker in the aftermath of 9/11 and following Bush's invasion of Iraq. Among other things, Hersh told us of the bungled efforts to catch Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan; of the dubious business dealings of the superhawk Richard Perle - a report that led to Perle's resignation as chairman of the Pentagon's Defense Policy Board (Hersh alleged that Perle improperly mixed his business affairs with his influence over US foreign policy when he met the Saudi arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi in 2003. Perle described Hersh as 'the closest thing American journalism has to a terrorist' and threatened to sue before falling oddly silent); and of how Saddam's famous efforts to buy uranium in Africa, as quoted by President Bush in his 2003 State of the Union speech, were a fiction. Most electrifying of all, however, was his triple salvo on the abuse of Iraqi prisoners in Abu Ghraib. It was Hersh who first revealed the full extent of this torture, for which he traced the ultimate responsibility carefully back to the upper reaches of the administration. 'In each successive report,' writes David Remnick, the editor of the New Yorker, in his introduction to Chain of Command, 'it became clear that Abu Ghraib was not an \"isolated incident\" but, rather, a concerted attempt by the government and the military leadership to circumvent the Geneva Conventions in order to extract intelligence and quell the Iraqi insurgency.' As Remnick points out, this reporting has 'stood up over time and in the face of a president whose calumny has turned out to be a kind of endorsement'. Bush reportedly told Pakistan's president, Pervez Musharraf, that Hersh was 'a liar'; after the third of his reports on Abu Ghraib, a Pentagon spokesman announced that Hersh merely 'threw a lot of crap against the wall and he expects someone to peel off what's real. It's a tapestry of nonsense.'</p> <p>Earlier this year, Hersh turned his attention to Iran: to Bush's desire to bomb it and to America's covert operations there. But while Hersh believes the President would still dearly love to go after Iran, the danger of that actually happening has now passed. Events, not least the sinking of the global economy, have moved on. So he is shortly to write about Syria instead, which he has recently visited. In the dying days of the Bush administration, he says, it is noticeably easier to meet contacts - Cheney, the enforcer, is a lot less powerful - and the information he is getting is good. By coincidence, it was in Syria that he first heard about what was going on inside Abu Ghraib, long before he saw documentary evidence of it. 'I got in touch with a guy inside Iraq during the Prague Spring after the fall of Baghdad, a two-star guy from the old regime. He came up to Damascus by cab. We talked for four days, and one of the things we talked about was prisons. He told me that some of the women inside had been sending messages to their fathers and brothers asking them to come and kill them because they'd been molested. I didn't know whether it was GIs playing grab ass or what, but it was clear that the women had been shamed. So when I first heard about the photographs, I knew they were real. Did I think the story would be as big as it was? Yeah. But was it as big as My Lai? No.' Only a handful of relatively lowly military personnel have so far been punished for their part in the abuse, and Colonel Janis Karpinski, the commander of the Iraqi prisons, was merely demoted (from Brigadier General), in spite of the fact that the Taguba Report, the internal US army report on detainee abuse that was leaked to Hersh, singled her out for blame. 'And John Kerry wouldn't even use it [Abu Ghraib] in his campaign. He didn't want to offend the military, I assume.'</p> <p>Four decades separate My Lai and Abu Ghraib. You have to ask: wasn't it appalling for him to be investigating US army abuses of civilians all over again? Didn't he think that lessons might have been learnt? Yes, and no. It made him feel 'hopeless', but on the other hand, war is always horrible. In 1970, after his My Lai story, he addressed an anti-war rally and, on the spur of the moment, asked a veteran to come up and tell the crowd what some soldiers would do on their way home after a day spent moving their wounded boys. With little prompting, the traumatised vet described how they would buzz farmers with their helicopter blades, sometimes decapitating them; they would then clean up the helicopter before they landed back at base. 'That's what war is like,' he says. 'But how do you write about that? How do you tell the American people that?' Still, better to attempt to tell people than to stay feebly silent. What really gets Hersh going - he seems genuinely bewildered by it - is the complicit meekness, the virtual collapse, in fact, of the American press since 9/11. In particular, he disdains its failure to question the 'evidence' surrounding Saddam's so-called weapons of mass destruction. 'When I see the New York Times now, it's so shocking to me. I joined the Times in 1972, and I came with the mark of Cain on me because I was clearly against the war. But my editor, Abe Rosenthal, he hired me because he liked stories. He used to come to the Washington bureau and almost literally pat me on the head and say: \"How is my little Commie today? What do you have for me?\" Somehow, now, reporters aren't able to get stories in. It was stunning to me how many good, rational people - people I respect - supported going into war in Iraq. And it was stunning to me how many people thought you could go to war against an idea.'</p> <p>As for the troop 'surge' and its putative success, he more or less rolls his eyes when I bring this up. 'People are saying quietly that they are worried about Iraq. This is nothing profound, but by the time the surge got going, ethnic cleansing had already happened in a lot of places. There was a natural lull in the violence. The moment we start withdrawing, and relying on the Shia to start paying members of the Awakening [the alliance of Sunni insurgents whose salaries were initially paid by the US military, and who have helped to reduce violence in some provinces]...' His voice trails off. 'And the big bad bogeyman is Saudi Arabia. There's an awful lot of money going to Salafist and Wahabist charities, and there's no question they'll pour money into the Awakening, and they're so hostile to Shi'ism and to Iran that how can you possibly predict anything other than violence? How do we get out of this? There is no way out. We have a moral obligation to the people of Iraq that goes beyond anything that anyone's talking about. The notion that it's their problem, that we should just leave... I mean, can you believe what we've done to their society? Imagine the psychosis, the insanity, that we've induced.' He stabs the yolk of one of his poached eggs, and sets about his toast like he hasn't eaten in days.</p> <p>Seymour M Hersh (the M is for Myron) was born in Chicago, the son of Yiddish-speaking immigrants from Lithuania and Poland (he has a twin brother, a physicist, and two sisters, also twins). The family was not rich; his father, who died when Seymour was 17, ran a dry-cleaning business. After school he attended a local junior college until a professor took him aside, asked him what he was doing there and walked him up to the University of Chicago. 'Chicago was this great egghead place,' Hersh says. 'But I knew nothing. I came out of a lower-middle-class background. At that time, everyone used to define themselves: Stalinist, Maoist, whatever. I thought they meant \"miaowist\". Seriously! Something to do with cats. Among my peers, they all thought I would write the great novel, because I was very quick and cutting. I've just read Philip Roth's new novel [Indignation], and the arrogance of his character reminded me of that certitude. I was always pointing out other people's flaws.' He went to law school but hated it, dropped out and wound up as a copy boy, then a reporter for the local City News Bureau. Later he joined Associated Press in Washington and rose through its ranks until he quit for a stint working for the Democrat senator Eugene McCarthy. Pretty soon, though, he was back in journalism. 'Using words to make other people less big made me feel bigger, though the psychological dimension to that... well, I don't want to explore it.' His wife of 40 years, Elizabeth, whom he describes as 'the love of my life' in the acknowledgements of Chain of Command (they have three grown-up children), is a psychoanalyst. Doesn't she ever tell him about his ego and his id? He looks embarrassed. 'No, no... marriage is... different. When you live with someone you don't... The hardest part for her is when she tells me to take out the garbage and I say: \"Excuse me? I don't have time. I'm saving the world.\"' Later, however, he tells me that journalism, like psychoanalysis, is about 'bringing things into focus'. </p> <p>He was a broke freelance working for a new syndication agency when he got wind of My Lai. A military lawyer told him that a soldier at Fort Benning, a Georgia army base, was facing a court martial for murdering at least 109 Vietnamese civilians. Hersh rocked up in Benning and went on a door-to-door search, somehow avoiding the officers on base, until he found Lieutenant William L Calley Jr, a boyish 26-year-old otherwise known as Rusty. He asked the former railway pointsman if they could talk, which they did, for three hours. They then went to the grocery store, got steaks, bourbon and wine, and talked some more at the apartment of Calley's girlfriend. Calley told Hersh that he had only been following orders, but nevertheless he described what had happened (it later turned out that soldiers of the 11th Brigade killed 500 or more civilians that morning). Soon after, 36 newspapers ran the story under Hersh's byline. Some, however, did not carry it, in spite of the fact that Calley's own lawyer had confirmed it, among them the New York Times. The scoop caused not only horror but disbelief. Hersh, though, was not to be put off. 'By the third story, I found this amazing fellow, Paul Meadlo, from a small town in Indiana, a farm kid, who had actually shot many of the Vietnamese kids - he'd shot maybe 100 people. He just kept on shooting and shooting, and then the next day he had his leg blown off, and he told Calley, as they medevac-ed him: \"God has punished me and now he will punish you.\"' Hersh wrote this up, CBS put Meadlo on the TV news, and finally the story could no longer be ignored. The next year, 1970, he was awarded the Pulitzer prize. </p> <p>How does Hersh operate? The same way as he's always done: it's all down to contacts. Unlike Bob Woodward, however, whose recent books about Iraq have involved long and somewhat pally chats with the President, Hersh gets his stuff from lower down the food chain. Woodward was one of those who was convinced that WMD would be found in Iraq. 'He does report top dollar,' says Hersh. 'I don't go to the top because I think it's sorta useless. I see people at six o'clock in the morning somewhere, unofficially.' Are they mostly people he has known for a long time? 'No, I do pick up new people.' But with new contacts he must be wary; there is always the danger of a plant. His critics point to what they regard as his excessive use of unnamed sources. Others accuse him of getting things wrong and of being gullible. A low point came in the Nineties, when he embarked on a book about Kennedy, The Dark Side of Camelot. Hersh was shown documents that alleged the President was being blackmailed by Marilyn Monroe, and though he discovered that they were fake in time to remove all mention of them from his book, the damage to his reputation had already been done - and the critics let rip anyway, for his excitable portrayal of JFK as a sex addict and bigamist. There was also the time, in 1974, when he accused the US ambassador to Chile, Edward Korry, of being in on a CIA plot to overthrow President Allende. Some years later, Hersh had to write a long correction; it ran on page one of the New York Times. As a Jew, his mailbag since 9/11 has also included letters from readers who denounce him as a self-hater (later, at this office, he shows me one of these: its author, an MD with a Florida postcode, accuses him of being a 'kapo' - the kapo were concentration camp prisoners who worked for the Nazis in exchange for meagre privileges). </p> <p>His supporters, though, believe that his mistakes - and even the wilder allegations he sometimes makes in speeches - should always be put in the context of his hit rate. A former Washington Post reporter, Scott Armstrong, once put it this way. Say he writes a story about how an elephant knocked someone down in a dark room. 'If it was a camel, or three cows, what difference does it make? It was dark, and it wasn't supposed to be there.' Hersh himself points out that, since 1993, he has been up against the stringent standards of the New Yorker and its legendary team of fact checkers. 'By the way, all my inside sources have to deal with the fact checkers, and they do. People find it hard to believe that, I don't know why.' And then there is his editor, David Remnick. 'I never love editors,' he says. 'But David is smart and he has great judgement.' How often does he check in with Remnick? 'I'm sure he would tell you less often than I should. He gets pretty angry with me. Sometimes we have these rows where I won't take his calls. He says no to a lot of stuff - stuff I think the editor would die for! Admittedly, it is not the Seymour Hersh weekly. But sometimes he'll say: \"We are not going to publish this kind of stuff 'cos it's frigging crazy.\"' It was Tina Brown, formerly of Tatler and Vanity Fair, who brought him to the New Yorker. 'What's-her-name... yeah, Tina. She gave me a lot of money, and she said: \"Just go do it!\" But she used to worry. She'd call me up and say, \"I sat next to Colin Powell at dinner last night and he was railing about how awful you are.\" So I would say, \"Well, that's good.\" And she'd say, \"Is it?\" And I'd tell her, \"Yes, it is.\"'</p> <p>Does it worry him that he is sometimes described as the 'last American reporter'? Who is coming up behind him? 'A friend of mine wants to put $5m into a chair for investigative journalism for me, but why would I want to do that? Look, the cost of running my kind of work is very high, and a lot of stories don't even work out. I know a wonderful journalist who works on the internet. I called friends of mine at the Times and the Post. But he hasn't been hired because he would cost a lot of money.' But Hersh is in his seventies (he is a year younger than John McCain, though you'd never know), he can't keep going forever. Or can he? Most reporters start out hungry but somewhere along the way are sated. Not Hersh. 'I have information; I have people who trust me. What else am I going to do? I love golf and tennis and if I was good enough, I'd be professional. Since I'm not, what am I gonna do? Why shouldn't I be energetic? Our whole country is at stake. We have never had a situation like this. These men have completely ruined America. It's so depressing, my business!' Yet he seems chipper. 'No, I'm not chipper. I don't know how to put where I am... I don't take it that seriously. I've been there: up, down, back up. I do a lotta speeches, I make a lotta money, I proselytise.' Does he like making money? 'Are you kidding? I do!'</p> <p>After we finish breakfast, he takes me to the office. He is eager to put off the moment when he must get on with his Syria piece. The more time he wastes with me... well, the morning will soon be over. Inside he points out a few choice interior-design details - the Pulitzer (it nestles among dozens of other awards), the framed memo from Lawrence Eagleburger and Robert McCloskey to Henry Kissinger, their boss at the State Department, which is dated 24 September 1974, and reads: 'We believe Seymour Hersh intends to publish further allegations on the CIA in Chile. He will not put an end to this campaign. You are his ultimate target.' Then he roots around in a cairn of paper for a while - quite a long while - eventually producing a proof of one of his articles with Remnick's editing marks on it. I've never seen anything so harsh in my life. Practically every other sentence has been ruthlessly disembowelled. 'Yeah, pretty tough, huh?' He also shows me one of his own memos to a contact. It makes reference to the current administration. 'These guys are hard-wired and drinking the Kool-Aid,' it says, deadpan. He laughs. He's getting cheerier by the minute. Soon it will be time for lunch! Now he puts his feet on the desk, removes one training shoe and jauntily waves the sweaty sole of a white sock at me. A couple of calls come in. He is concise bordering on cryptic. Finally an old Times colleague arrives. 'I knew this guy when he had hair!' Hersh shouts as this fellow and I pass in a small area of floorspace not yet covered by books or papers. I'm leaving, but Hersh doesn't get up and he doesn't say goodbye. A breezy salute - and then his eyes fall ravenously on his pal.</p>",
  "<p>Warning lights are flashing in eastern and central Europe, where Hungary and Ukraine are seeking bail-outs from the International Monetary Fund to avoid the turmoil that threatens to bankrupt Iceland.</p> <p>A number of countries have had their credit ratings slashed to junk status amid worries that the next leg of the credit crunch is about to explode. Economies are on the verge of collapse after years of easy credit that fuelled an unsustainable property and consumer boom, roaring inflation and widening current account deficits.</p> <p>A research paper by Lars Christensen, head of emerging markets research at Denmark's Danske bank, written before Hungary and Ukraine appealed for international aid, makes for unsettling reading.</p> <p>Here is what he says about Bulgaria: 'We see a major risk that the Bulgarian boom could turn into a serious bust. A property market bubble threatens economic stability.'</p> <p>Elsewhere, Estonia is already in the lurch: 'The hard landing has become a reality; Estonia faces years of sub-trend growth to reduce the excesses.' </p> <p>Latvia looks like a basket case: 'Larger imbalances here make the economic adjustment more painful.'</p> <p>In countries such as Hungary, the economy is in free fall as foreign banks and investors withdraw capital, leaving an acute shortage of credit. The Hungarian banks can't help because they are over-leveraged and face calls from overseas institutions for loans to be repaid, threatening the local banking system with meltdown.</p> <p>If banks in emerging markets implode, it puts a further strain on the international financial system when even a small shock could lead to more panic-selling on global stock markets, as well as undermine efforts to restart interbank lending and restore credit lines.</p> <p>'Are there more Icelands out there?' asks Christensen. 'Yes, quite a few, it's worrying.'</p> <p>What happened in Iceland is instructive. It's not the Icelandic government that has gone bust, as the Russian government did a decade ago, but the Icelandic banks. But that has a devastating effect on Iceland's economy; as confidence has drained away, the currency has gone into free-fall. </p> <p>For Iceland, which is heavily dependent on imported goods, that means costs for businesses and consumers go through the roof, raising the spectre of shortages in the shops, especially where companies have lost money in the banking collapse. And that is quite apart from the devastating effect on confidence flowing from the failure of three of the country's biggest banks.</p> <p>The value of Icelandic bonds - debt instruments sold to global investors in return for interest payments - have recorded sharp falls. Standard &amp; Poor's has slashed Iceland's debt to just above investment grade; other countries are faring worse, with Ukraine and Serbia reduced to junk status.</p> <p>Even more alarming, billions of euros worth of credit default swaps, linked to emerging market debt, could leave institutions that underwrote these contracts - banks, hedge funds and insurance companies - with huge liabilities. Credit default swaps make up a $60 trillion market that has grown massively since 2000 and is largely unregulated. CDS products are used by investors to offset the risk of a country defaulting or its prospects deteriorating. They have often been comfortingly described as being like insurance contracts. If only it were that simple. </p> <p>A parallel derivatives industry has grown up around CDSs, with the risks passed on to speculators prepared to buy swaps in the hope of making a profit when they sell them on. </p> <p>'It is a bit like shorting a bank share,' says a London-based stockbroker. 'Except that you are betting on the contract's value rising; the more risky the outlook, the more valuable the swaps contract.'</p> <p>If a country defaults, the liabilities must be paid by the CDS counterparty or counterparties. But CDS prices are an indicator of how close the market believes a country is to defaulting. For example, the cost of using a CDS to insure against Iceland today stands at $15 for every $100 of insurance, up fourfold in three years. Further afield, Pakistan is judged to be very close to default - perhaps a 90 per cent chance - with the cost at $30 for every $100. For Argentina, the price is $24.</p> <p>It is quite likely that many banks in emerging markets will go bust as they have over-extended themselves.</p> <p>But what happens if a country defaults? For answers, look back to the Russian banking crisis of 1998, where the state (which owned all the banks) was forced to disclose that it was no longer solvent.</p> <p>International investors fled, dumping Russian assets, which led to a run on the currency. Wages to state employees went unpaid, causing widespread social unrest. The Russian stock market lost 75 per cent of its value. There was political upheaval.</p> <p>The International Monetary Fund eventually stepped in with a $23bn financial package and the Russian government was forced to devalue the rouble. Eventually, calm was restored and global panic was narrowly averted.</p> <p>But remember that crisis was against a backdrop of relative economic stability. The credit crunch, however, has seen the MCSI emerging markets index lose $1.8 trillion of value in a year, while many exchanges in developing countries have notched up a 50 per cent fall in share prices. The West's banking system (not to mention the state of the global economy) remains fragile. Another systemic shock is the last thing it needs.</p>",
  "<p>Poised, smart and ready to serve, Carly Fiorina - at one time the most powerful female executive on the planet - scents power.</p> <p>There's still a chance that the most intense, volatile and bitter presidential election campaign in living memory could spring a stunning final twist, delivering the Republicans to victory.</p> <p>If John McCain triumphs, Fiorina will follow in his slipstream. As a close friend and economic adviser to the Republican candidate, it is a sure bet that the first and only woman to run a Fortune top 20 company will be catapulted into office.</p> <p>'We'll see,' the former chief executive of Hewlett-Packard said last Friday at her Washington home. 'We never expect anything.'</p> <p>With Fiorina, though, expectations are generally pretty high. The daughter of a law school professor from Austin, Texas, she is a fiercely ambitious corporate ball breaker. Starting as a secretary, the 54-year-old penetrated the male dominated preserve of technology companies by drinking beer mugs of vodka and attending meetings held in strip clubs to shatter the glass ceiling as no other woman had ever done in America.</p> <p>It is an achievement that still stands even if it ended in humiliation. Fiorina was forced unceremoniously to bid farewell to her $3m salary and the corporate jets after a merger she had bulldozed through caused Hewlett-Packard to lose an estimated $14bn in value. </p> <p>Still, Fiorina has since dusted herself down. A long standing friendship with McCain has led her to reinvent herself as 'Carly the politician', giving much needed ballast to his economic team - an area in which McCain himself confessed he was no expert. </p> <p>The talk was that Fiorina was being lined up to become Treasury Secretary. And then, last month, disaster. On a radio interview, Fiorina was asked whether she thought Sarah Palin had the experience to run a large US corporation as she had done. 'No I don't,' Fiorina replied. 'That's not what she is running for.' Later, on television, she was asked to clarify those remarks and she compounded the error by saying: 'Well, I don't think John McCain could run a major corporation.'</p> <p>The comments could not have come at a worse time. Even as the markets were collapsing and voters were losing their jobs, savings and homes, a key figure in McCain's team was questioning the candidate's experience. Since 17 September McCain's lead has disappeared. Obama has not looked back. </p> <p>A well-placed Republican insider said: 'This is the most intense campaign and you have to surround yourself with experienced people. She does not qualify in that department. She's not a political person. </p> <p>'For McCain it has to be a seriously calculated, strategic team. She's very bright and a good executive, but politics is not as easy as people think. It's a lot tougher even if you are a smart woman.'</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, Fiorina is furious about the incident. 'Do you know what I said?' she asks. 'The Obama campaign literally cut and pasted those remarks to say what they wanted. They pushed it on the radar. I was given a silly question. I gave a hypothetical answer.' </p> <p>But McCain has another big problem with Fiorina, and it dates back to her sudden departure from Hewlett-Packard after winning a bitter merger battle with rival computer giant Compaq.</p> <p>The saga ended in Fiorina being summarily dismissed as she was preparing to fly to the Swiss Alpine resort of Davos for the meeting of world leaders and the business elite. But she received an estimated $24m severance package.</p> <p>To many, this is an example of rewarding failure. Not to Fiorina, though, whose self-belief remains intact. After all, the subsequent performance of HP, she says, more than vindicates her merger strategy. And it is true that analysts recommend HP shares as a defensive bulwark in plunging markets. But her huge payout has drawn comparisons to the rewards Wall Street bankers have scooped as markets collapse. </p> <p>'My pay package, which Obama has falsely stated, was voted on by shareholders. It's a matter of public record. The way it was handled is the way McCain believes it should be handled.' </p> <p>But isn't the financial crisis caused in part by the style of buccaneering capitalism you epitomised? 'I completely reject that,' she says. 'The current financial crisis has been caused by people lacking in common sense and judgment, greed, unethical behaviour and a fixation with short-term stock prices by everybody from analysts and investors. We had people betting the farm that real estate would rise forever.'</p> <p>It is the kind of homespun talk that could win over voters, but they don't appear to be listening to her or McCain. Voters see the dotcom collapse, the failure of Enron and the present crisis as three financial disasters under a Republican administration. 'Greed is a bipartisan affliction. It's not about political parties. When business people lose common sense, that's a problem,' she says.</p> <p>According to Fiorina, 'the great problem is markets not having confidence with decisions they made'. Is this a criticism of George Bush and his Treasury Secretary, Hank Paulson? 'I think right now, people are doing their best whether it's Gordon Brown or Hank Paulson. There's plenty of blame to go around.'</p> <p>As the US and Europe sink under a wave of debt, there is an increasing sense that American global dominance is disintegrating. So much for the neo-conservative vision of a 21st century ruled by the United States.</p> <p>'Asia without question is emerging as a financial powerhouse. This certainly is different to the 20th century. But American leadership is going to depend on the same things it always has. Innovation and entrepreneurial spirit,' says Fiorina. 'Political power is based on economic power. As long as the US is innovative our growth will be assured.'</p> <p>But will it be a US with McCain as its leader? He's 72. He must be pretty tired. 'They're all getting pretty tired. They have been doing this for two years. But John McCain is a great fighter. He is a man of extraordinary strength and vigour. He described this process as a privilege. He will fight to the last day.'</p> <p>Republican insiders now believe that even if McCain does pull off a victory, Fiorina is no longer in line for the Treasury Secretary's job she covets but a position as an ambassador or some other junior role.</p> <p>That would be a disappointment to the woman who accepts that she 'had to do crazy things to function in a man's world'. When she attended that meeting in a strip club she said her male colleague attempted to intimidate her. But she 'focused on the job' because 'every day you have to earn your stripes'.</p> <p>Twice married, she seems to live by buzzwords and motivational phrases. 'Tough choices, inspired commitment, real results,' her website proclaims. In two weeks, the eyes of the world will be focusing on just one result.

  "<p>Sir Fred Goodwin, departing chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland, called it 'more of a drive-by shooting' than a negotiation; another banking executive likened it to lobbing a nuclear bomb at the industry.</p> <p>The military analogies are appropriate enough. Five men have so far fallen victim to the \u00a337bn rescue package drawn up by the government to rescue three of Britain's biggest banks - Sir Fred, his chairman Sir Tom McKillop, and Johnny Cameron, the head of his investment banking arm, along with HBOS's chairman Lord Stevenson and chief executive Andy Hornby. And the pain of the bail-out will have spread far further before the banks can claim to have returned to health.</p> <p>There are the taxpayers, for example, who are already coughing up some \u00a36,700 each to finance the \u00a3400bn rescue plan and are likely to face the lethal combination of higher taxes to fund the deal and rising unemployment as the banks are forced to retrench, restructure and repair the damage from two decades of profligate expansion. </p> <p>Some of that unemployment will emanate from the banks themselves. Stephen Hester, the British Land chief executive parachuted in to take over from Goodwin, will not reveal the detail of his strategy until the new year. But it is already clear that large swathes of the business will be deemed too risky and capital-intensive - including areas such as syndicated loans, structured credit and proprietary trading. That could mean significant job losses among the 25,000 employees of the global markets and investment banking business.</p> <p>He is also likely to be looking for businesses to sell. The sale of the Direct Line and Churchill insurance businesses is already well under way, but some have suggested that he may even consider selling Citizens, its US banking business - though insiders point out that its largely retail franchise is a reliable source of capital.</p> <p>Hester himself says that the business will have to become more focused on the UK - last year, 40 per cent of its revenues came from outside Britain, and that was before the acquisition of Dutch bank ABN Amro - although he insists that does not mean it will shed all its overseas assets. </p> <p>The cuts will not be confined to RBS: staff at HBOS and Lloyds TSB - and even Barclays - are likely to be waiting nervously for the tap on the shoulder and the redundancy letter. Lloyds' chief Eric Daniels has dismissed earlier suggestions that as many as 40,000 of the combined 140,000 workforce are under threat as a result of the merger, but the stark profits warning that accompanied HBOS's \u00a312bn capital-raising from the government suggests that there could end up being even more casualties as Britain's biggest mortgage lender is forced into a painful retrenchment.</p> <p>HBOS says there has been a 'significant deterioration in credit conditions and falling property prices with associated increased provisioning'. It added that profits would also be hit by more write-offs on toxic loans and higher funding costs. That alone would have justified Lloyds TSB rewriting the terms of its acquisition had Daniels not already got a cast-iron excuse: while Hornby had asked the government for just \u00a33bn, the government - backed by the regulators - insisted it needed four times that, more than double what Lloyds TSB itself is raising. Combined with the collapse in HBOS's share price since the deal was announced, Daniels barely had to bother with brinkmanship tactics as Hornby and Stevenson quickly realised they had nothing left to bargain with. They had no choice but to accept a scaling-back of the offer from 0.833 Lloyds shares for every HBOS one to 0.605.</p> <p>Despite the downgrading, Daniels will have to work hard to prove it was a bargain. Two months ago, his bank was being hailed as one of the few survivors from the bruising credit crunch: its focus on the UK market and conservative lending strategy meant it had avoided the high-risk lending and toxic assets that have brought rivals to their knees.</p> <p>But its takeover of HBOS has highlighted its own short-term financing problems: while HBOS was the most dependent of the remaining high-street banks on raising funds from the wholesale markets, rather than from depositors, Lloyds is next in line: combining the two simply makes Lloyds TSB more risky.</p> <p>As Ian Gordon, banking analyst at Exane BNP Paribas, says, the government's rescue package has exposed 'one myth - that of Lloyds TSB's supposed superior ability to raise capital and funding. Lloyds TSB is now completely reliant on the good faith of the government if it wishes to pay a dividend to ordinary shareholders at any point in the next five years before it is able to call the preference shares itself.'</p> <p>The dividend issue is a particularly contentious one: while banks and their investors are pressing the government to water down its condition that the banks repay the \u00a39.5bn of preference shares being issued as part of the deal, the government is reluctant to allow any concessions which mean that shareholders take money out of the company while taxpayers are still providing support. But without at least some prospect of a dividend, it will be hard to persuade existing investors to take up any of the new shares, increasing the cost to the taxpayer. That means some reinterpretation of the rules looks inevitable. </p> <p>The 'gold-plated' capital requirements set by the government meant that Barclays chief executive John Varley decided against taking up the government's offer to subscribe for preference shares, preferring instead to raise \u00a36.6bn from existing and new shareholders by next March. He has been making the most of his bank's ability to go it alone, claiming that his rivals will be 'hobbled' by what is effectively state control; if existing shareholders eschew the capital-raising, the government will end up with close to 60 per cent of Royal Bank of Scotland and more than 40 per cent of a combined HBOS and Lloyds TSB. </p> <p>Certainly, Barclays appears to have escaped too much damage from the crisis. RBS joined HBOS in issuing a stark profits warning, saying its results will be below what it expected when it announced interim results in July and warns that there could be more write-downs to come - particularly, the City assumes, with a new chief executive at the helm. Barclays, by contrast, said its profit in September had 'significantly exceeded' the run-rate for the first six months of the year. Bob Diamond, its forceful president and head of its capital markets business, has also won plaudits for 'bottom-fishing' by buying the US business of Lehman Brothers from the receivers after it went bust last month.</p> <p>But the Exane analysts point out that its write-downs are markedly lower than at RBS. While the Scottish bank has written its holding of asset-backed securities and other toxic mortgage assets down to as little as 21p in the pound, Barclays' are still at more than 60p. While that may reflect older, and therefore better-quality, holdings, there is still considerable suspicion that far more provisions will be needed.</p>",
  "<p>Ivan, a thick-set Serbian ex-military policeman who now works as a bodyguard for foreign companies in northern Iraq, has a good sense of humour. He jokes that the country is 'boring' now. Before commercial flights to the country started after the 2003 war, he and his twin brother Stojan used to ferry European businessmen in heavily armed convoys across the mountainous and largely lawless border from Turkey into Iraq. 'That was fun,' he smiled wistfully. But though security in Iraq has since improved, for Westerners it is still one of the most dangerous places on earth. 'Last week I had to eliminate someone,' he explains, without going into detail. The foreign businessmen who have just stepped off the plane at Erbil airport in the north of the country decide against pressing him further. He hands his new charges body armour and then they join their round-the-clock heavily armed security detail. It's a unique welcome, Iraq-style. </p> <p>On Monday, in more serene surroundings at the Sheraton Park Lane opposite Buckingham Palace in London, Hussain al-Shahristani, Iraq's oil minister, met executives from Shell, BP, ExxonMobil, Chevron, Total and dozens of other foreign oil companies. On the table were eight contracts to develop Iraq's eight largest oil fields, which Baghdad hopes will almost double the country's production to 4.5 million barrels of oil per day (bpd). Last month, Shell agreed to invest up to $4bn to form a joint venture to produce gas in the south. It has also become the first oil major to open a permanent office in Baghdad, though most foreign oil executives remain reluctant to visit the capital because of safety fears, despite pressure from the Iraqi oil ministry to attend meetings there. Five years after the US-led invasion of the country, the long-awaited - and controversial - foreign-led development of Iraq's vast oil resources looks set to begin in earnest. </p> <p>But as security improves and Baghdad starts to draw up contracts, many questions remain, says Samuel Ciszuk of Global Insight. Addax Petroleum, a Swiss oil company, is one of a handful of small foreign firms already operating in Iraq. Managers at its huge Taq Taq field near Erbil know from experience that Iraq is not an easy place to do business. There has been no production at the field since July because the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), which governs the semi-autonomous region, has not extended the company's licence. </p> <p>More importantly, the longer-term plans of Addax and its Turkish partner, Genel Enerji, to increase production at the site to 150,000 bpd are clouded in uncertainty. No pipeline runs from the field, so trucks have to carry the oil, selling it to the local market, usually at a discount to going rates. Addax says that only a maximum of 60,000 bpd can be moved this way. But no construction work on a pipeline has begun because Baghdad has banned the KRG from exporting oil from the region. The ban will only be lifted once the long-awaited national oil legislation - which will set out who controls the oil and how to exploit it - is passed. The problem is, Baghdad and the KRG have been locked in stalemate over the new law for the past two years, and no one knows when it may get signed.</p> <p>Herish Muharam Muhamad, chairman of the regional board of investment, was adamant when he spoke to The Observer that the KRG should have control over the region's oil. 'When we talk about oil and natural resources, we are talking about our constitutional rights,' he said. 'If our friends in the rest of Iraq think we should not be doing this, it's not our problem.' The continuing stand-off leaves companies like Addax in limbo. </p> <p>The oil majors are also anxiously watching the tortuous negotiations, which continued last week. The eight contracts outlined in London on Monday offer attractive terms, but the worry is that the new oil legislation - whenever it is passed - could change the terms retrospectively. </p> <p>Despite the problems, Iraq remains hugely attractive. It holds an estimated 112 billion barrels of reserves, the second largest in the world. Much of the country remains unexplored and production costs are among the lowest in the world. With resource nationalism limiting the opportunities for oil majors to boost their production, Iraq is a valuable prize. </p> <p>But foreign oil companies have to tread warily in a country often suspicious of their motives. Baghdad has refused to offer production-sharing agreements - preferred by companies as they allow them to book a share of a country's reserves - because Iraq wants to retain sovereignty over its oil. John McKeon, a former director of Circle Oil who knows Iraq well, says: 'The Iraqis are suspicious of the foreign companies and who is behind them. They want to get a good deal for the nation.'</p> <p>When Addax executives visited Shiwashok, a dusty village of primitive huts near its Taq Taq field, Mr Sadi, a village elder, told company executives about the severe summer drought and asked for more water supplies from the company. They promised to oblige. In a complicated country, Addax - like all foreign oil companies in Iraq - knows it needs support with the KRG, Baghdad and among ordinary Iraqis for its gamble to pay off.</p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling must have congratulated themselves last Monday morning as share prices across the world rocketed. After hours of adrenaline-fuelled late-night talks with Britain's cash-strapped banks, the Treasury had hammered out a \u00a337bn bail-out plan and Brown had persuaded leaders across Europe and the US to follow suit.</p> <p>But just 48 hours after greeting the Brown proposal with heady euphoria, financial markets swung back into a dangerously black mood. Traders had been focused on the threat of a total collapse of the world's financial system - what IMF managing director Dominique Strauss-Kahn called 'meltdown'; but once that fear had been eliminated, with the promise of massive government intervention, investors began fretting about the next worst possibility - a long, painful recession.</p> <p>Gloomy unemployment figures released in Britain last Wednesday morning and, later, news that retail sales in the US had fallen by 1.2 per cent in September, the third successive month of declines, switched the focus firmly back to the economy. At the same time, UK banks raised questions about the conditions Darling had imposed on the bail-out deal to ensure taxpayers got their money's worth. The brief bout of exuberance dissipated and a fearsome sell-off got under way. By the end of the week, the markets had made up some of the lost ground, with Wall Street and the FTSE ending Friday on a calmer note, and veteran investor Warren Buffett saying there were bargains to be had; but no one was under any illusion about the sickly health of the world's economies.</p> <p>When shaken G7 finance ministers signed up to the principle of bailing out their banking systems in Washington last weekend, they knew their actions would be too little, too late to prevent the financial turmoil from sparking a worldwide economic crisis. As Ben Bernanke, the cerebral professor in charge of the Federal Reserve, put it in a speech on Wednesday: 'Stabilisation of the financial markets is a critical first step, but even if they stabilise as we hope they will, broader economic recovery will not happen right away.'</p> <p>John Higgins, senior market economist at consultancy Capital Economics, says the markets should settle down but that will not be the end of the story: 'We do think that what's happened over the past week is a watershed, but the key point is not to confuse bank recapitalisation with economic recovery.'</p> <p>Brown may be chary of mentioning the 'R-word' - recession - but there is a growing consensus among economists that in the UK and much of Europe, one is already well under way. Russell Jones, senior strategist at RBC Capital Markets, says the second half of this year, and the first half of next, are looking, 'distinctly recessionary' in the US too, as the grim cocktail of tighter credit and shattered consumer confidence take their toll.</p> <p>Research by analysts at Credit Suisse on the usual characteristics of recessions in Europe and the UK shows they tend to be long - lasting an average of almost two years - and involve a sharp rise in unemployment. It adds that Britain's spendthrift consumers are entering this particular downturn in a much worse financial state than their eurozone counterparts, with large debts and few savings tucked away for impending rainy days.</p> <p>Banks may no longer be about to go bust, but even with government support they are likely to be cutting back on lending - and consumers and firms are now so nervous about the future that there may be few takers for loans anyway.</p> <p>As one indication of the devastation that can be wrought on economies when it gets harder to borrow, Jones points to 1979, when the Carter administration in the US introduced direct controls on lending to rein in a booming economy. Activity collapsed, as firms and families struggled to get loans. Output in the following quarter plunged at an annual rate of 7.8 per cent, making it the weakest three months since the Great Depression. 'That gives you some idea what happens when the credit tap turns off,' Jones says. 'This kind of dysfunction can have a huge impact.'</p> <p>Six months ago, economists were hopefully clinging to 'decoupling', the idea that rising powers such as China and India would carry the torch, even as the US and Europe slipped into recession. The oil price continued to soar, as though, despite a looming downturn in the US, still the world's biggest consumer of crude, consumption would be held up by China's insatiable appetite.</p> <p>But the longer the financial turmoil has continued, the wider its effects have spread, and the harder it has become for any economy to escape. The oil price has plunged in the past month, dipping below $70 a barrel last week, as it finally dawned on investors that, just like the price of property and shares, commodities had experienced an unsustainable bubble.</p> <p>By next year, the IMF now expects economies everywhere to have caught the West's cold, with the only hotspots in Africa, and some of the less exposed South American economies.</p> <p>In Geneva, last Thursday, the UN's development arm, Unctad, warned that many developing countries were now concerned they would be in the firing line, without the resources to prop up their own banks and rescue their economies from deep recession.</p> <p>'The impact on developing countries will be much deeper than was anticipated,' says Supachai Panitchpakdi, the former World Trade Organisation boss who is now head of Unctad. Perhaps most alarmingly, there are growing fears about the health of China. When Beijing copied the co-ordinated rate cut by other central banks on 8 October, it was seen as a gesture of solidarity, a sign that China was keen to join the international onslaught on the crisis. But analysts say it was also a genuine attempt to offset the hit to exports, as US consumers, who have sucked in billions of dollars' worth of cut-price Chinese goods, tighten their belts.</p> <p>Tom Albanese, boss of the mining giant Rio Tinto, sparked widespread alarm in the markets last Wednesday, when he warned that he expected China to be 'pausing for breath' in the next 12 months. Optimists say this 'pause' will be an ideal opportunity for China to carry out a long-awaited rebalancing, from heavy dependence on exports, to generating its own virtuous circle of growth through demand at home. Pessimists warn that if you take the impetus of strong global growth away, China could suffer badly.</p> <p>Globalisation and the internet were meant to usher in the 'weightless economy' as developing countries competed to provide cheap services across the globe. But exporting old-fashioned goods also remains crucial to the success of many developing countries.</p> <p>For some, the credit crunch will mean full-blown financial crisis. So far, Iceland has provided the most graphic illustration of what happens to an economy when financial boom turns to bust. But a string of other emerging economies, from South Korea to Ukraine, now appear to be on the brink of crisis.</p> <p>Even in Western Europe, the financial fall-out is far from over. Almost every day, another powerful symbol of the sector's prowess bites the dust. Switzerland is almost as well known for its smooth, secretive bankers as for Toblerones, but last Wednesday acting finance minister Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf was forced to announce that she would rescue its biggest bank, UBS.</p> <p>Berne will spend $54bn buying toxic assets from UBS. Widmer-Schlumpf was so busy dealing with the crisis that she opted not to fly to Washington for the IMF meeting last week. She is standing in for her colleague, Hans-Rudolf Merz, who suffered a heart attack last month.</p> <p>UBS's rival, Credit Suisse, has managed to avoid holding out the begging bowl to taxpayers only by raising $8.75bn on its own, much of it from the Qatari Investment Authority.</p> <p>Turning to cash-rich Middle East states such as Qatar is one solution more Western governments may have to take in the coming months. Another unpalatable but increasingly plausible-looking solution to the crisis is to ramp up public spending - unthinkable until recently, particularly in the UK, but perhaps the lesser of the evils if a serious recession is looming.</p> <p>As the downturn bites, Kevin Gaynor of RBS says the bank rescue package only tackles one element of what he calls a 'three-legged stool'. Credit is becoming more expensive and harder to come by, which is the problem policy-makers were trying to tackle by propping up crisis-hit banks. But this process is being driven in turn by falling asset prices; which are being driven by declining incomes, among both consumers and firms.</p> <p>Gaynor believes governments will only stop the rot by adopting a 'significant and sustained growth stimulus package' in the US and Europe: spending billions of dollars on infrastructure projects to create jobs and soak up some of the many thousands made unemployed. Already, politicians once firmly wedded to the power of the free market have adopted radical state-funded solutions. But economists are increasingly coming round to the idea that governments will have to throw a lot more money at this crisis before it is over.</p> <h2>The damage: experts' views</h2> <p>'By restricting flows of credit to households, businesses, and state and local governments, the turmoil in financial markets and the funding pressures on financial firms pose a significant threat to economic growth.'</p> <p><strong>Ben Bernanke, chairman, US Federal Reserve</strong></p> <p>'Once concerted government action is taken, the effects will take time and it is clear that there will be tough economic times ahead.

But at times the wild gyrations of leading indices have defied logic. Why, for instance, have shares sometimes rallied strongly without any apparent explanation?</p> <p>One theory is that the development of a large number of financial instruments enables investors to 'short' stocks in a bigger way than in previous bear markets.</p> <p>As stock-market historian David Schwartz says: 'When large short positions have built up, as they have today, a major buying opportunity can emerge at the same time.' That sounds obtuse, so how does it work? </p> <p>First, punters short the shares of companies where they believe the price will fall. The process involves borrowing shares from a financial institution such as a bank, which charges a fee, then selling them straight away in the hope of buying them back at a later date for a lower price when the time comes to return them. The short seller pockets the difference between the sale price and the purchase price. It offers the opportunity of making a large profit.</p> <p>But what if shares go up? When that happens, or there is a belief that it might, short sellers rush to cover their positions by buying back shares at once in a desperate bid to avoid losses. </p> <p>The accompanying buying frenzy pushes prices higher than they would probably go otherwise, tempting other investors back into the market. That partly explains the rallies that have punctuated the gloom of recent weeks.</p> <p>But when you consider the much broader market falls, investors are not behaving that irrationally given that banks, housing and commercial property all hit the skids. For institutions that have 'gone long' - that is, held on to shares in the belief that things might get better - the past few weeks have been terrifying.</p> <p>When the US bail-out package was initially blocked by Congress at the end of last month, it caught everyone unawares and led to a sharp decline in the value of shares. At times like that, the herd mentality kicks in.</p> <p>Markets are forward indicators of what investors believe is in store in the next year or two. Recent worries have revolved around a possible collapse of the entire Western banking system; that now seems less likely, but the sell-off has continued because of the fear that, despite government intervention, a deep global recession looms. </p> <p>Don't be surprised, however, if there is another big rally at some point in 2009, or even earlier. If investors believe recovery is within sight, shares could rise at exactly the same time as tens of thousands of workers are being laid off and businesses are going bust. Markets and economic reality do not always work in sync.</p> <p><strong>Richard Wachman</strong></p>",
  "<p>What kind of country are we, and how do we want to be seen? How best to get the message through?</p> <p>Stamps haven't been the modern method for quite a while but perhaps we have misjudged things. On Tuesday the Royal Mail released six stamps celebrating Women of Distinction. The design was powerful and forthright, befitting its subjects: the suffragist Millicent Garrett Fawcett and her sister, women's health champion Elizabeth Garrett Anderson; family planning campaigner Marie Stopes; family allowance pioneer Eleanor Rathbone; civil rights activist Claudia Jones; and equal pay advocate Barbara Castle. So we may ask, how far can we go?</p> <p>British achievers have been represented in sticky miniature since Shakespeare in 1964. Once you had to be dead to appear, but then Queen drummer Roger Taylor (alive) accidentally appeared on a stamp for Freddie Mercury (dead) in 1999, and the reins were loosened for sports players. Being dead has never been qualification in itself, as artist Steve McQueen discovered last year when his sheets of stamps replacing the Queen's head with soldiers killed in Iraq met with unease from the Royal Mail. But the act itself posed a perplexing dilemma: should stamps be used for modern campaigns - the environment perhaps? Or lower interest rates? Or an ending of the closure of local post offices? Or what else?</p>",
  "<p>The title of Margaret Willes's book about bibliophiles, <strong>Reading Matters </strong>(Yale \u00a319.99), is both a slick pun and a stern admonition: reading matters because it is in danger of becoming a lost art, like calligraphy or stenography. We live, as Henry Hitchings says in <strong>How To Really Talk About Books You Haven't Read</strong> (John Murray \u00a312.99), a book which he ironically addresses to non-readers, in a period not so much of illiteracy as of alliteracy. We surf, browse, scavenge information from cybernetic sources and gut words to send curt txt msgs, but we lack the time and patience to retire into books, adjusting to their steady, sedentary tempo and burying ourselves in the remembered experience they store and guard. </p> <p>Willes extols this imperilled activity in a study of the book trade that begins in the benighted medieval days when only one book existed - the so-called 'good book', with its store of commandments and pre-emptive parables. Luckily, later readers and collectors refused to accept the Bible's monopoly of truth, and treasured books for defiantly secular reasons. Samuel Pepys loitered in bookshops to flirt with nubile fellow-customers; Jane Austen's heroines joined libraries to acquire and assert an intellectual freedom that was otherwise forbidden.</p> <p>For Willes's most obsessive collectors, books do more than furnish rooms: they change the nature of those rooms, turning a house into a multi-cameral head. Thomas Jefferson - whose personal collection became the basis of the global Library of Congress - installed modular, portable shelves in his home at Monticello, mobilising his books to match the associative leaps of thought. In Lincoln's Inn Fields, the architect John Soane lined his breakfast room with glazed bookshelves, piling spare volumes on tables or under windows. Social activities like eating or conversing were edged into corners: like a book, Soane's house was the retreat of a solitary, preoccupied thinker.</p> <p>The grand consummation of Willes's narrative arrives in the 1930s, when Penguin democratised ownership of books. Consumerism, which ended by glutting the world with pulp fiction, began with high, idealistic hopes. Allen Lane shocked stuffy booksellers by dispensing paperbacks from a 'Penguincubator', a slot-machine which disgorged volumes by Shaw or HG Wells when you fed it a sixpence. </p> <p>Lane's warehouse was the crypt of a Marylebone church (designed, as it happens, by Soane). Petty cash was stuffed into tombs with metal doors, and 'books were hurled down chutes from the churchyard, packed in brown paper parcels and sent upwards in an ancient lift formerly used for bodies'. Reading here did more than brighten life; it overcame death, briskly quickening cadavers.</p> <p>In their books of what used to be known as bookchat, Henry Hitchings and John Sutherland deal with less noble uses of literature. Hitchings treats it as a social accessory, a bluffer's currency that can help you win the competitive games that yuppies play at dinner parties. In Sutherland's often touching memoir about his adolescent reading during the 1950s, <strong>Magic Moments</strong> (Profile \u00a310.99), literature's value is as a vault of smut. Sutherland spends hours locating a missing, unreadably filthy page of Ulysses in Colchester Reference Library; he and his schoolmates obtain a copy of Lady Chatterley's Lover and frenetically read it, one-handed, in their dormitory. </p> <p>Hitchings, of course, has read all the books that his anti-intellectual cronies can't be bothered with. He is an efficient crammer, who even teaches his dopey pupils how to pronounce the tricky names of foreign fellows like Proust and Flaubert. But the irony of Hitchings' enterprise misfires. Why does a serious scholar, the author of a superb account of Samuel Johnson's compilation of his dictionary, bother pretending to be as much of a philistine as his oafish, affluent friends? Because no publisher these days would pay for a book in praise of great books, Hitchings is compelled to adopt a subtler, sneakier tactic, mocking what he actually holds dear. </p> <p>At his best, he drops his blokey persona and writes like the enthusiast for literature that he truly and a little shamefacedly is. He has a fine line in appreciative fervour, and is fond of calling literary flourishes 'gorgeous': he applies the adjective to Dante's 'fortunate isles laden with golden fruit' and to the rollicking obscenity of Molly Bloom in Ulysses. He also finds some 'gorgeously expressive passages' in the Bible, which would have scandalised the medieval clerics who refused to view that sacred book as a work of art. His real concern isn't arming people to talk about books they haven't read; secretly he aims to turn them into readers. But too often an edgy, evasive jocularity returns to make light of this mission. In England, Hitchings says, it's not done to talk about feelings, and it's equally poor form to have feelings about books. </p> <p>John Sutherland has fewer compunctions about describing his delight. But whereas Hitchings sings the praises of Homer and Virgil, Sutherland can only recall his callow affection for the patriotic blather of Nicholas Monsarrat and the sleazy violence of James Hadley Chase. He writes well, however, about the tedium of adolescence in the days before electronic entertainment, when boredom made readers of us all. 'Books,' he says, 'filled the yawning chasms between the young person's daily reveille and lights out.' I, too, was grateful for the 'vastly long' volumes published by Penguin Classics: empty aeons of idle time could now be filled in by toiling through Cervantes or Rabelais. It's not an unworthy motive for loving books.</p> <p>The frivolity of Hitchings and the nostalgia of Sutherland seem trivial when set against the urgent, even desperate anthems for books written by the Venezuelan librarian Fernando B\u00e1ez. In his deprived childhood, reading helped B\u00e1ez to forget his hunger, fear and misery; he was inconsolable when the flooded Orinoco river carried off the cheap volumes he treasured. His <strong>A Universal History of the Destruction of Books</strong> (Atlas \u00a314.99) grieves over such calamities and assails the vandals who have deliberately ransacked libraries - Calvinist iconoclasts, Nazi book-burners, and the crass American generals who allowed looters to pillage the museums and galleries of Baghdad. For B\u00e1ez, books cannot be reduced to adjuncts of social and sexual display, as they are by a 'hedge-fund guru' known to Hitchings who bones up on 'the latest cool fiction so he can impress women at parties'. Books encapsulate our collective memory: if they are destroyed, how will we know what it means to be human? </p> <p>A great book, in Milton's estimation, was 'the precious life-blood of a master spirit', and nourished the soul of whoever read it. Sam Savage's fable <strong>Firmin</strong> (Weidenfeld \u00a310.99), about a bibliophilic rat who eats his way through a Boston second-hand bookshop, literalises Milton's metaphor. Firmin chews paper because there is no other food available. Absorbing his diet of words, he somehow learns how to read, which enables him to roam the world without leaving home: he travels up an African river with Marlow in quest of Kurtz and cheekily fondles Tolstoy's Natasha as he waltzes with her. Despite his mawkish cuteness, Firmin has a sharply critical bite. He dislikes 'rat literature' on principle, despises Ratty in The Wind in the Willows, and contemptuously pisses on Stuart Little. </p> <p>As paper becomes obsolete and printed words disappear into digits flickering on a screen, literature needs such cultists. B\u00e1ez quotes a grateful tribute to the profession they shared by his fellow librarian Borges, who described the book as the most astonishing of all the instruments invented by man. Other technologies augment our limbs or organs: the plough fortifies our arm, the microscope and telephone extend our eyes and ears. But the book is a tool that allows us to exercise the imagination. As Firmin discovers when he hops across oceans and abridges centuries, reading multiplies life. </p> <p>\u2022 To order any of the above for a special price with free UK p&amp;p, go to <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/home.do\">observer.co.uk/bookshop</a> or call 0870 836 0885</p>",

  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Will Lewis Hamilton become the formula one world champion today?</strong> It's the only question that matters and the young Briton has put himself in exactly the right position to do it by qualifying on pole position for the Chinese grand prix. It is 50 years to the day since Mike Hawthorn claimed Britain's first ever drivers' title - for Ferrari - and if Hamilton can do it today he'll become the ninth Brit to see his name etched on that trophy.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>So, what does Hamilton need to do to avenge last year's disappointment and win that title?</strong> Here are some scenarios if all three title contenders finish the race. If the following happens, Hamilton does it...<br>1 Hamilton wins and Felipe Massa finishes the race no higher than fifth<br>2 Hamilton finishes second, Massa finishes no higher than seventh position and Robert Kubica does not win<br>3 Hamilton finishes third, Massa finishes out of the points, and Kubica does not win or finish second</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>Of course,</strong> I could spent hours doodling and plotting different situations - a meteor wipes out the McLaren prat perch; a giant duck plucks Massa from his cockpit - but there's less than 30 minutes to go until the start of the race, so let's not bother. Instead, we'll re-cap that starting grid:</p> <p>1. Lewis Hamilton, Britain, McLaren<br>2. Kimi Raikkonen, Finland, Ferrari<br>3. Felipe Massa, Brazil, Ferrari<br>4. Fernando Alonso, Spain, Renault<br>5. Heikki Kovalainen, Finland, McLaren<br>6. Sebastian Vettel, Germany, Toro Rosso<br>7. Jarno Trulli, Italy, Toyota<br>8. Sebastien Bourdais, France, Toro Rosso<br>9. Nick Heidfeld, Germany, BMW<br>10. Nelson Piquet Jnr., Brazil, Renault<br>11. Robert Kubica, Poland, BMW<br>12. Timo Glock, Germany, Toyota<br>13. Rubens Barrichello, Brazil, Honda<br>14. Nico Rosberg, Germany, Williams<br>15. David Coulthard, Britain, Red Bull<br>16. Mark Webber, Australia, Red Bull<br>14. Kazuki Nakajima, Japan, Williams<br>18. Jenson Button, Britain, Honda<br>19. Adrian Sutil, Germany, Force India<br>20. Giancarlo Fisichella, Italy, Force India</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>Mystic mog:</strong> what are your predictions for the race Gem, I can hear you cry from under your duvets. Well, to say the start isn't going to be easy for Hamilton is to understate the mental challenge of getting over last weekend's Fuji fluff-up, to ignore the bright-red danger to his side and immediately behind and to banish from memory last year's Shanghai surprise, when the Briton's world title chances creepy-crawled into the gravel here. Running mate Kovalainen should be up there in a supporting role, but he's on the third row having qualified behind Alonso - the man who has said he will help Massa to win the title. Sheesh! I think Hamilton will make a mint start, repel Ferrari's challenge and drive to a cool victory... but I think Massa will finish in second place and take the showdown to Sao Paulo. We've seen a catalogue of mistakes from both the big title challengers this season, but I think this race is too critical to mess up. The again, we probably thought that last year...</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>For the record,</strong> Hamilton has said he will use last weekend's erroneous start as an experience not to repeat and that he's driving for points, not the title, today. Here he strides, out to the grid, a quick thumbs up for the camera. What a cool cucumber.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>I've not mentioned Robert Kubica, have I? </strong>Well, given that he's back down in 12th on the grid, he's a little difficult to spot. Understeer and poor balance wrecked his qualifying and he's said that it's unlikely he'll win the title now. Personally, I think it should go to Hamilton or Massa anyway - they've been the boys to watch - but while there's a mathematical possibility you never know.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>Good morning Gary Naylor, </strong>thanks for your email and a blindingly obvious scenario that I overlooked: 'Lewis and Massa finish together in a Parisian courtroom and nobody wins?'</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>The weather looks fine</strong> at the moment, warm and dry, but rain is predicted in the closing stages. No sleet forecast, though.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>Did I just hear a muffled cackle escaping from Alonso's helmet? </strong> I wonder how he's going to help Massa to win the title? Hop into the Ferrari? Lend him his lucky kecks? Get in front of Hamilton and hit the 'tacks' and 'oil slick' buttons?</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>The cars are heading around to prepare for the start, </strong>Hamilton is on the harder tyre but both Ferraris are on the soft option. BMW have just told Kubica over the intercom that there could be rain fairly soon...</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>Hamilton's engineer tells him</strong> 'brakes are good, brakes are good'. Phew! That'll make things a bit easier. Official weather forecast: 40 per cent chance of rain.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>Start:</strong> Here we go... Hamilton makes a good start and retains the lead. Clean into the first corner this weekend... Top three same as at the start but Kovalainen battling Alonso.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>Lap one: </strong> Hamilton leads from Raikkonen, Massa, Alonso and Kovalainen. The Finnish McLaren driver had got past the Renault but Alonso reclaimed the position. Behind them it's Heidfeld, Vettel and Kubica - the Pole up to eighth after a strong first lap.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>Lap two: </strong>Trulli has pitted for a new nose after a clash at the first corner on the first lap. He must have collided with Bourdais - who has dropped to 18th position.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>Lap three:</strong> Hamilton's lead over Raikkonen is 2.5seconds and Massa is 4.1seconds off the man he is fighting for the title with.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>Lap four:</strong> Trulli pits again, this time to retire, our first non-finisher of the race. Webber is fighting Barrichello for P10. Hamilton just shy of 5seconds ahead of third-placed Massa - the McLaren is flying.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>Lap five: </strong>Here's the order - Hamilton, Raikkonen, Massa, Alonso, Kovalainen, Heidfeld, Vettel, Kubica, Piquet, Barrichello, Webber, Glock, Rosberg, Coulthard, Button, Nakajima, Bourdais, Sutil, Fisichella</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>Lap six: </strong> Ferrari must be concerned about Hamilton's superior pace. He's steadily pulling away at the head of the field - now 3.5seconds over Raikkonen and 6.1seconds over Massa. The Brazilian's pace in particular should be worrying the boys in red. Hamilton has just done a 1min36 (the new fastest lap) and Massa's almost a second slower.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>Lap seven: </strong>Webber has taken tenth from Barrichello at the final corner.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>Lap eight:</strong> Hamilton still the only man to set a 1m36 and there's not much else to report other than his stonking pace.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>Graham Wayne</strong> has sent me a riddle. At least, I don't have a clue what he's on about. But that could be because I should by rights be tucked up in bed. He says: 'Hamilton gets away properly without taking to the countryside. And this despite the little seen interference to his car on the grid when some very confused US Republicans were caught smearing lipstick on his tyres...'</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>Lap ten: </strong>Webber has passed Piquet for ninth at the final corner. Piquet's engineers kindly tell him not to worry, as the man from Down Under is running light. Aw, that's nice of them. So much for Briatore's tough love.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>Charlie Whiting </strong>has stuck his hand outside the window and now says there's just a 20 per cent chance of rain.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>Lap 11: </strong>Raikkonen has set the fastest lap with 1m36.612s and Massa has also dipped below the 1m37 mark as the Ferrari's get up to Hamilton's pace.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>Lap 13:</strong> Webber pits - as insinuated by the Renault engineers. Hamilton had a slide running through turn two but still sets a time four tenths up on Raikkonen. Rosberg has passed Glock.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>Lap 14:</strong> The Ferrari mechanics are in the pit lane... but McLaren's boys in bacofoil haven't jumped up. Massa pits!</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>Lap 15: </strong>Alonso also pitted at the same time. Massa rejoins in eighth behind Kubica and Alonso comes in behind Piquet in tenth. Now the McLaren engineers come out.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>Lap 16: </strong>Raikkonen pits at same time as Hamilton. The McLaren gets out first - keeping to harder tyres - and they rejoin separated by Vettel, which is more good news for Hamilton. Sutil has retired.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>Lap 17:</strong> Massa has kept on the softer tyres. Hamilton is 5.6seconds ahead of Raikkonen. And Kovalainen - yet to pit - leads from Heidfeld.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>Lap 18:</strong> Heidfeld has now pitted. A bit further down the grid, Barrichello is holding his own in tenth. It might not be in the points, but it marks a good afternoon for the Brazilian Honda driver.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>Lap 19:</strong> Kovalainen now pits, as does Vettel, with both staying on the harder tyre. Hamilton leads again. This is looking good for the Brit.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>Lap 20:</strong> Hamilton's lead over Raikkonen is now 6.9seconds. Kubica - who has yet to pit - is in third ahead of Massa. The Brazilian's deficit to Hamilton is 14.1seconds...</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>Graham Wayne </strong> - who I hope isn't the only person reading this LbL - says: 'stand by for rain \u2013 it's my real worry now, that everything will go weird in the wet \u2013 but Hamilton is looking like a champ to me...' I wish he was, Graham, but if Massa finishes in third then he won't be champ in this race. Graham also adds that his humour is still warming up. Anyone else know any good jokes?</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>Lap 23:</strong> There really isn't much to report at the moment... Raikkonen's pace is pretty much matching Hamilton's. Piquet pits.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>Hello Kate Connolly!</strong> Nice to hear from you again. \"I can't believe that James Allen just wasted valuable commentary time telling us about Lewis Hamilton's little brother taking his GCSEs,\" you grumble. Me neither. I mean, I know there isn't too much excitement at the moment, but really. \"Who's your favourite driver? Not necessarily who's the best driver, but who do you find yourself rooting for? You know how I love Kubica, and I'm also rather partial to poor old Bourdais myself, which means I spend a lot of time being dismayed, and outraged after last race. He was robbed!\" I certainly agree that Bourdais was robbed - although my post-race blog picking on the stewards raised a bit of ire. Personally, I'm rooting for Hamilton. He's been the most exciting driver to watch the season and has the most commitment in races. He may have made mistakes, but he hasn't put in dismal performances like Massa in Silverstone.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>Lap 27: </strong>Kubica has not pitted and Raikkonen has now made up time on Hamilton. The Ferrari driver has reduced the gap to 6.4seconds. Massa is 15.4seconds behind Hamilton.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>Graham Crawford emails:</strong> 'Will Alonso now make no attempt to get past Massa, to further his grudge against Hamilton? That would be rather disgraceful, wouldn't it? (Being paid millions to race and not racing.)' <em>Sooo</em> true Graham. Alonso is 6.4seconds behind Massa but I can't see him putting his foot down. Half the race is now run - not exactly a thriller, is it?</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>David Goodrum</strong> is stuck at work and following the LbL but has no jokes. Who are you rooting for David? Do you want Hamilton to sock it to Massa?</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>Lap 29: </strong>Coulthard and Fisichella have pitted. Two of the oldest and two of the slowest in this race... cruel but accurate.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>Marcus Gearey </strong>(fab racing name <em>Gear</em>ey) asks how many coffees I've downed this morning. None is the answer, as there were no shops open on my way into the office at 6.30sm sadly. \"I've had 2 pit stops,\" says Marcus. \"I took on a double espresso at 7AM but had to take on an extra single 15 minutes ago. If it carries on at this stultifyingly dull level of excitement I may need another splash and dash though I figured perhaps with a cheeky dash of chocolate sprinkles for a level of excitement sufficient to drag me to the kitchen in the first place. Can I promote my \"hilarious\" F1 comedy website pitflaps.com? I had 14 hits last month which I believe may be some sort of internet-indifference record though I'd be grateful if anybody could confirm as I could do with the publicity...any publicity.\" Let's all check it out...</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>Lap 32:</strong> Webber and Nakajima have both pitted. Raikkonen has flicked the bird to Fisichella when he lost a second getting past the Force India. The order is still the same at the front and Hamilton's lead over Raikkonen is 8seconds.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>Bear with me... this is great.</strong> Brian Garvey says: \"Lewis Hamilton and Philippa Masa walk into a bar. Lewis asks for a pint and Massa asks for... a... hm... hm... ?... hm... - a shandy. Barman asks: why the big paws? Because Massa was dressed a bear!</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>Lap 35:</strong> A right front puncture for Heikki Kovalainen! This isn't good for McLaren's constructors' title hopes. He's crawling round trying to get to the pits...</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>Good morning Simon Woods!</strong> 'The TV keeps telling me that Hamilton will want to turn the revs down a bit... but doesn't he still have his joker engine change to use?' Yes, I believe he does. But perhaps you're only allowed to use it if you can prove your current unit is bust? Sorry, I don't have a definitive answer on this one.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>Lap 37: </strong>Alonso has pitted and the Ferrari mechanics are preparing for a driver... it's Massa. Martin Whitmarsh is shown timing the rival's stop.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>Ben emails from Sao Paulo:</strong> 'Spare a thought for me - not only did I have to wake up for a 5am start, but I'm a lone Brit amongst friends and family all rooting for Massa. While Hamilton seems to be handling the pressure ok so far, I wonder how he'd fare if he knew that his eventual victory would mean unashamed mockery on my part of every Brazilian I meet (which is everyone everyday)?'</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>Lap 39: </strong>Hamilton and Raikkonen both pit and change to soft tyres. Again no dramas.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>Dave Goodrum emails: </strong>'Would love to see Hamilton win it, but would like to see Massa finish high enough for the racing to continue. I always think that the edge goes off if the championship is decided too early. Plus I enjoy the bitching that's been going on between the drivers, I think its great!' Dave you wag, enjoying all the tit-for-tat. I'm getting a bit fed up of it personally and, although I understand your reasons, I fear that if the title goes down to the finale it'll be Massa who wins it, not Hamilton. Which wouldn't be good for Ben from Sao Paulo...</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>Lap 40:</strong> Just two seconds between Raikkonen and Massa... how obvious will he make it when he lets Massa past? Not very.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>Lap 42:</strong> Vettel has pitted from sixth position, but it's a bit of a tardy stop. The German is quietly having another good race. Kovalainen has passed Rosberg... for 15th... as he fights his way back from the puncture.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>Tim in Spain</strong> has just sent an interesting email: 'Morning all, presumably Alonso imagines he is already on Ferrari's payroll? According to the totally biased press over here Ferrari are desperate to get rid of Raikkonen, who is all washed up in their opinion, and replace him with the perpetually whining (my opinion) Alonso. Having said that I am rooting for Massa, so carry on doing nothing Fernando.'</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>Martin Warren asks:</strong> 'Why the change to soft tyres when the others seemed to be doing the trick - thanks?' The drivers have to use both specifications of tyres during the race - those are the rules. Massa appeared to be happier with the balance on the softs earlier but now they have no choice but to run him on the harder tyres.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>Lap 46: </strong>Button has made the second and final stop in a dismal race. Not that it's his fault...</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>Katie has emailed to say:</strong> 'I don't think you're allowed to use your 'joker' at the last race.' And she's completely right... here's the rule:<br><em><br>From 2008, a driver will not be penalised the first time he needs a replacement engine during the season, unless it is at the final event of the championship.</em><br>So Hamilton might ease off somewhat, with his 15second lead and less than 10 laps to go.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>Lap 49:</strong> Massa has eased past Raikkonen. It's a team game, so you can't really criticise them. Hamilton only looks set to extend his lead by two points... unless there's rain or an earthquake or a stampede of termites in the next few laps.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>Lap 50: </strong>Our order, then, is: Hamilton, Massa, Raikkonen, Alonso, Heidfeld, Kubica, Glock, Piquet, Vettel, Coulthard, Barrichello, Nakajima, Bourdais, Webber, Rosberg, Button, Fisichella. Kovalainen has retired through brake issues.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>A handful of laps left</strong> then and it looks certain that the drivers' title will go down to wire in Brazil in a fortnight. What's the betting that Hamilton's car will appear on the Interlagos grid covered in bubble wrap to protect it from hits from Alonso and Raikkonen? And the Toro Rossos? The McLaren will only need to finish fifth to win the title there if this race finishes with its current order...</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>Lap 54:</strong> Hamilton's advantage over Massa is just under 16seconds. It doesn't look like he's turning down the wick much.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>Last lap:</strong> Wake up everybody, it's over! A dull race but a safe one for Hamilton, who takes the flag. He's done the best he could and now the title will be decided in Brazil in a fortnight. Thanks to Raikkonen, Massa crosses the line in second position.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p>Here is how they crossed the line:<br>1 Lewis Hamilton<br>2 Felipe Massa<br>3 Kimi Raikkonen<br>4 Fernando Alonso<br>5 Nick Heidfeld<br>6 Robert Kubica<br>7 Timo Glock<br>8 Nelson Piquet<br>9 Sebastian Vettel<br>10 David Coulthard<br>11 Rubens Barrichello<br>12 Kazuki Nakajima<br>13 Sebastian Bourdais<br>14 Mark Webber<br>15 Nico Rosberg<br>16 Jenson Button<br>17 Giancarlo Fisichella</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>What it means: </strong>Hamilton has proved that he has the mental strength to cope with the pressure of this world title fight. With a seven point advantage, he has to finish no higher than fifth in Interlagos - even if Massa wins - to claim the title. McLaren must have both cars finish if they want to keep in the hunt for the constructors' title, as Ferrari's advantage is now 11 points after Kovalainen failed to finish. We're set for a fantastic showdown in Brazil in two weeks so join us then.</p>",
  "<p>Thirty years ago when I was irresponsible, full of beans and working for an evening newspaper there used to be a technique to divert the attention of the libel lawyer. The trick was to write a wholly outrageous allegation into the first few paragraphs of a story, then place the fact that you wanted to publish lower down. The libel lawyer would skid to a halt beside your desk clutching several sheets of copy - newspaper articles were then typed with three pieces of carbon paper and presented with one paragraph per page - and gibber that you could not call someone a glue-sniffing pederast in print. A tussle would ensue but after several minutes you would surrender the allegation. I lost count of the times my treasured fact got into print.</p> <p>The government's tactics on the counter terrorism bill remind me of this - at least in effect. We know how much Jacqui Smith wanted 42-day detention without charge from her graceless capitulation in the Commons, but look at what remains in the bill and you will see that she's far from defeated. You may go further and reach the conclusion that in their claim to defend our free society the government, Home Secretary and the Home Office have become its greatest threat.</p> <p>Still intact are the measures for post-charge questioning, which may add to the presumption of guilt; the confiscation of property without trial; extra punishment without trial beyond the original sentence; a new offence for volunteer workers of not giving police information; and a new offence of providing information about the armed forces. </p> <p>This last measure was raised in a letter from Lord Rea, Sir Geoffrey Bindman and others to the Guardian in June: 'We fear this will become yet another convenient tool for use against the peace movement,' they said. Others believe that the bill's measures will, 'provide for the possibility of travel bans and long-term daily reporting or surveillance arrangements for anyone convicted of an offence under anti-terrorism legislation, without any regard for the seriousness of the offence'.</p> <p>In other words we have still got one hell of a fight to preserve British liberty, and while there are many other serious calls on our attention these days we should pay attention to Ms Smith who towers over our democracy like some comic-strip super-villain dominatrix. She is wrong, corrosive and arrogant.</p> <p>As Moli\u00e8re said: 'A woman always has her revenge ready.' Having been defeated by what for most was a heart-warming majority in the Lords she announced a draft bill for extended detention without trial that she said she would keep until a time of crisis when she could push it through Parliament without opposition. What does that say for her respect for the calm deliberations that defeated 42 days last week or the government's opportunistic use of the menace of terrorism?</p> <p>The Home Secretary is remorseless. Last Wednesday she announced a typical New Labour consultation on the government's Interception Modernisation Programme that will gather and store the information from all emails, internet connections and phone calls. 'I want this (consultation),' she said, 'to be combined with well-informed debate, characterised by openness, rather than mere opinion, by reason and reasonableness.' I wonder how 'openness' trumps 'mere opinion' in her mind. At any rate it is clear 'reasonableness' in this context means going along with the government and giving up our freedoms, as we have been doing for 10 years now.</p> <p>Let us just be clear that this new proposal represents a very great threat to individual privacy and in practice it is no different from the original idea of collecting the content of all emails and phone calls. 'The government is proposing to record - for life - the details of everyone you call or write to and what websites you visit,' said Phil Booth of NO2ID. Keith Vaz, chair of the Home Affairs select committee, Lord Carlisle, the government's independent reviewer of terror laws and the left-wing backbencher John McDonnell - none of them in the front rank of civil libertarians - all expressed grave alarm at this idea.</p> <p>So did the Times and Daily Mail. So did the audience of BBC's Question Time: when Geoff Hoon, the new Secretary of State for Transport said he would go a long way to undermine civil liberties to stop people being killed by terrorists, the mockery of the audience, to say nothing of the guilt and irritation on Hoon's face, was palpable.</p> <p>Two years ago I wondered in these pages when the penny would drop with the British public and the media about the attack on civil liberties. It is plainly beginning to. The public is worried about the shoddy laws the government tries to rush past them with its phony calls for consensus and reasonableness.</p> <p>A small incident in Liverpool last week seemed to indicate something was happening. When police tried to break up a demonstration in support of the Freedom Not Fear organisation, it was passers-by who shouted, 'free speech' and 'you're a disgrace' as the police made arrests.</p> <p>The change of attitudes has come about partly because of the government's appalling record on data security. Not a week goes by, it seems, without a security lapse. Last week the Armed Forces minister Bob Ainsworth was forced to admit that the Ministry of Defence has lost a hard drive which may contain the details of 1.7 million people. This follows the news that the Home Office has lost a mere 43 laptops and 93 cell phones in three years, that a memory stick containing records of 84,000 prisoners has gone missing and that the personal details of 18,000 NHS staff vanished in the post. When the government asks the public to trust it with their data the response is: 'Why the bloody hell should we?'</p> <p>We have got a long way to go and that is due to the authoritarian habits that have become so deeply ingrained in government departments, principally in the Home Office. The worry must be that whatever the government, the Home Office rolls on with its own agenda, a state within a state bent on increasing the power of centralised authority.</p>",
  "<p>There's a woman in front of me at the checkout having a bad till moment. She's digging through her pockets, searching for change - she hasn't got enough. She's only trying to buy two things, and the queue is long. 'I've got to have the eggs, because I'm baking this cake, and I've got to have the fags for my friend,' she says, humiliated. 'She's waiting in the car.' The man on the till shrugs. The queue looks away. </p> <p>So she swaps the Marlboro for the cheapest generic cigarettes from the shelf behind the till and asks him to total it again. She is still short. She moans. And then someone puts her out of her misery and gives her 50p: 'Thanks so much, you're a love,' she smiles (and now we all wish we'd been the generous one). 'Nearly nine quid! Since when did eggs cost more than fags?' she says in apology to all of us.</p> <p>It is a good question. The cigarettes were \u00a34.18 for 20 - and the dozen own-brand organic eggs, \u00a34.26. That seemed incredible - so I went to look at the shelf. The prices were laid out clearly - this was a high-street branch of Tesco. Large organic eggs were 35.5p per egg. Free-range eggs were 26.4p each. Standard Scottish eggs were marginally more expensive than free range, at \u00a31.67 a half dozen. What was that about?</p> <p>In September Alistair Darling was interviewed in the Guardian, and announced that we were facing the worst recession in 60 years. The interviewer tested the chancellor of the exchequer's street awareness by asking him the price of half a dozen eggs: 'Around \u00a31.20,' he told her. I'd checked, and that week he was just about right. But here, just four weeks later in the poorer part of a Scottish city, eggs were 30 per cent more expensive. And this at a time when, as farmers had told me, their biggest cost, the price of chicken feed, has at last been going down. </p> <p>'The truth is, no one can really work out what the supermarkets are doing with prices on fresh food,' says Anna Bassett, the Soil Association's poultry expert, and a former chicken farmer herself. 'You look back through the records and see the strangest things. Most people agree egg prices are up by 35-39 per cent on the past 18 months. But then you look at Tesco's organic price, for instance, and see that it's hardly changed. Could be because of a discount, or the effects of some contract with a supplier. All we know is that someone is making some money: it's the processor or the retailer, but it damn well isn't the farmer.'</p> <p>The job: investigate the allegation that supermarkets have been taking advantage of the global food-price rises to carve some extra profit for themselves. It didn't seem like the hardest thing I've done for OFM. Line up few tearful chicken farmers, some smug retail buyers, a confused punter or two - it should all fall into place pretty easily, I thought. For a start almost everyone seems convinced the charge is justified - from the Daily Mail to the governor of the Bank of England. The average punter believes the supermarkets are guilty of extortion, just like the petrol companies with the oil-price rise. And the Office of Fair Trading has started an investigation into illegal price fixing.</p> <p>But I was wrong. It wasn't easy at all. This story swiftly disappeared into the misty realms of cost accountancy and the perverse habits of the British egg buyer. It took me to egg farmers who turned out to be too terrified of their customers to speak to me, even anonymously, and finally to the mysterious and unaccountable corporate giants that run Britain's egg business. These last have a code of omerta that makes the supermarket executives seem positively chatty.</p> <p>Some facts about eggs are indisputable. One is that the price of chicken feed for laying birds nearly doubled between October 2006 and June this year, because of the global rise in the price of cereals and fuel. In the same 18 months egg prices soared. According to the British Free Range Egg Producers Association (free range accounts for 50 per cent of all sales by value) in that time farmers saw the price of their eggs at the farm gate rise by 26 per cent. But the price charged in the supermarkets rose 39 per cent. One newspaper survey, looking at prices between May 2007 and May 2008, put the gap even wider - an 18 per cent rise in the price paid to farmers but 47 per cent in that asked of us in the supermarkets. </p> <p>The profit gap translates into a lot of money. Eggs more than triple in price between the hen and the supermarket checkout. At the time of writing, my local Tesco was selling a dozen large free-range eggs for \u00a33.16; the average price to farmers was 91p. </p> <p>We now pay more for eggs than ever before in modern history - so much so that the most expensive, organic, are going the way of holiday homes and other pre-recession fripperies. They're a luxury people are deciding they can do without: organic eggs are seeing the sort of collapse in sales that normally comes with a food scare. In September, sales were down 18 per cent on a year ago. </p> <p>Supermarkets, meanwhile, seem to have done nicely out of the food price rises so far - all of them except M&amp;S have recently reported healthy profit rises, including on like-for-like food sales. Yet they all also fiercely resist any accusation that they've taken the opportunity to increase margins on food - rather the opposite. Tesco and Sainsbury's say they've held back from passing rises on to customers.</p> <p>So what about that price gap on eggs? I asked several major supermarkets if they'd care to try and explain it. Waitrose said that it had agreed with its suppliers that egg prices would match their increased costs; this is confirmed by farmers who supply them. Only recently, since the drop in demand for organic, has Waitrose started to push for price cuts.</p> <p>Asda, which consistently sells eggs cheaper than its mainstream rivals, had a more complicated response. Sarah Bishop, the company's egg buyer, wrote as follows:</p> <p>'The retail price is up, but I am not making any more profit as a result. The price in store reflects the cost price I am now having to pay. The eggs that I buy are bought via an egg packer, who in turn buys them from a range of British egg producers. The egg packer is now charging me more money for my eggs, a lot more than they were charging 18 months ago. It's possible that they haven't passed all of this increase back to their own suppliers, which may help explain the discrepancy you've highlighted.' I asked Sarah if she'd tell me the name of Asda's egg packer, so I could see what they thought of this explanation. She wouldn't.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Anna Bassett at the Soil Association was unimpressed by the Asda statement. 'If everyone else in the chain has had to reduce the margin they take, it's not good enough just say we haven't increased our price.' Maintaining profit margin in an era of rising prices means of course that you will earn more money. If you sell a cake for \u00a31, on the basis that 10p of that will be profit, your margin is 10 per cent. If you commit to maintain the margin, and the cake price rises to \u00a31.50, you will make 15p. So in pure cashflow terms, price rises can be very good news for companies that manage to maintain their profit margin. During this price crisis, most supermarkets have done exactly that - which is why their food- sales results have been surprisingly healthy.</p> <p>And the egg farmers? I found it very hard to find any who would speak to me, on or off the record. 'It is just too dangerous to put your head up. Most of us sell to one packer: you might say all our eggs are in one basket,' said one large-scale free-range producer. 'If the packer found out I'm complaining to the media, I could lose all my business overnight.' </p> <p>This did not surprise the National Farmers' Union at all. 'We tried to get farmers to come and give evidence when the Competition Commission was investigating supermarkets,' Anna Davies of the Scottish NFU told me. 'It was almost impossible, they were so nervous - even under conditions of strict anonymity.' The Commission, which reported earlier this year, found that there was no need for curbs on supermarkets' purchasing or pricing practices.</p> <p>Tom Vesey has 16,000 free-range laying hens in Monmouthshire. He did speak to me, in his role as president of the British Free Range Egg Producers Association. 'I'm not whingeing,' he told me. 'And certainly our problems aren't as bad as they are in the pig or the lamb sector. But there's no question that the retailers have maintained or improved their margins - as they do in any price rise. And if they take more than their fair share, that's just not on. Plain greedy. But you'll never get the truth out of them.'</p> <p>But actually, the supermarkets were fairly open about the price of eggs. It's the packers who are at the centre of this puzzle - the five large British companies who take eggs from farmers, sort, grade and box them, and send them on to the shops. They also process eggs - raw liquid egg, used in catering, is an internationally traded product. Noble Foods, based in Hertfordshire, but with plants all over the UK, is the biggest packer. The company was formed two years ago by the merger of the packers, Dean's and Stonegate: now it is a giant bestriding the egg business. Noble owns chicken farms, and sells chicken meat and feed. It's agreed in the industry that Noble is so dominant that in effect it decides the egg price. A crucial component of the British food industry, then. But they don't talk to journalists. Not at all? 'Not often to me, and I'm in the trade,' said one agriculture journalist (who asked that I didn't name him either). What was going on here? I felt like I was in an episode of The Wire.</p> <p>Tom Vesey warned me that it was hard to pick apart the packers' costs - they don't tell him much either. One of the absurdities of egg consumption - or egg marketing, you may think - is that in Britain we demand large eggs. 'It's ridiculous - large eggs are too liquid, they spread all over your plate. It's hard to force a hen only to lay large ones,' said Tom. Breakages are also a hazard of the business. And so it is said that a packer must buy 120 eggs to sell 100. Demand for eggs is also scarily unstable - up in cold weather, and down in hot. The packing industry has seen other cost rises, notably in fuel and power bills - as have the farmers and the supermarkets. Yet no one has seen the rise of nearly 100 per cent in their core cost that egg farmers did in their chicken feed. (Feed is about 50 per cent of the cost of producing an egg.)</p> <p>I could not find any packing company that could explain its costs to me. Noble Foods' marketing director, Finn Cottle, gave a written statement merely saying that eggs remain 'relatively cheap' and without any explanation of Noble's role in the price chain. But I did get to speak to John Holt, who works at Noble in the purchasing of eggs from farmers. He agreed that farmers' costs had gone up excessively. 'I'm glad to say we as a company have managed to increase the prices paid to them proportionately.' How about the price that packers are asking retailers - and then consumers - to pay? 'Well, some of this product has been sold too cheap, too long: it's now being sold at a more sensible price that reflects the cost of production. The consumer is just not used to it.'</p> <p>Reasonable though this may sound, there are savage knock-on effects. For one, organic egg farmers are facing a catastrophe: many are now having to sell their much more expensive eggs 25 per cent cheaper, at free-range prices, because \u00a34 a dozen is just proving too much for credit-crunch era consumers. Farms are already closing, and others are dropping their organic certification. </p> <p>So that's the verdict: the egg price spike is the fault of the middlemen, who appear - though it can't be proven - to have upped their share of the egg price. The supermarkets have taken their usual profit margin, and in doing so increased their earnings. And the farmers? Well - it's the best ones who will suffer first, those who feed their hens organically and let them have the space and freedom you and I would think of as humane. As the balloon sinks, such extravagances are the first baggage thrown overboard.</p> <p>I thought eggs would be simple - and they are, at least when compared to other staples that have risen sharply over the past 18 months. The value chain in lamb, for instance, is much more complex, and the workings of the international market Byzantine. Yet the end result to farmers is the same: they seem to be receiving far from their share of the profit rise - not their 'fair' share, but a share that might keep them in business. </p> <p>Scottish lamb farmers, for instance, are in deep distress this autumn as they see the prices hardly more healthy than they were a year ago. And then a foot-and-mouth disease scare had meant a temporary ban in exports of British lamb, and so prices were at rock bottom. Yet lamb cutlets in your supermarket or butcher are 25-30 per cent more expensive than they were a year ago. This spring organic lamb was, bizarrely, cheaper at market than conventionally produced lamb. Yet no change in the differential in the prices was seen at meat counters. It seems the retailers decided it was too confusing, and too dangerous, to alter the premium that customers are accustomed to paying for organic.</p> <p>Other fresh-food producers are livid about the price gaps, too. DairyCo, which represents milk producers, said in September that British farmers lost over half a billion pounds in nine months in 2007 because the farm-gate price of milk lagged behind the retail rise. In 2007 supermarkets took 9.3p profit per pint of milk - in 1997 they took only 2.5p, says </p> <p>DairyCo. According to the National Farmers' Union, the average loaf of bread has increased by 30p, but the increase in the price of wheat would only justify 10p. Records kept by the British pig producers show the price of pork rising radically in supermarkets in June 2007, while the line on the graph showing the price to farmers hardly wobbles. Only this summer did the gap begin to narrow again. </p> <p>We asked seven major supermarkets to assure us that price rises over the last 18 months represented no more than the fair reflection of rises in costs. All those that replied denied taking excessive profit during the last two years, and most pointed to their current schemes to reduce prices on many lines.</p> <p>As OFM went to press, the supermarkets were just starting a new price war, an inevitable phase in their eternal round of price boosting and discounting. Asda announced cuts in 5,000 staple lines which its CEO, Andy Bond, said could cut average shopping bills by 50 per cent (I asked for details of exactly how this would be possible. I'm still waiting). Rivals were swift to react: Tesco, Morrisons and even M&amp;S responded with announcements of new discount lines. </p> <p>Asda's boss clearly believes some of his rivals are profiteering. In a debate on Word of Mouth, The Observer's food blog, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2008/sep/24/asda.response.food.price.war\">Bond told me</a>: 'There is no excuse in my mind for any retailer to take advantage of the difficult economy to make even more profit... Those companies that choose to make a quick buck at their customers' expense will live to regret it when the economy picks up.'</p> <p>I asked Steven Esom what he thought. Esom used to be head of foods at Marks &amp; Spencer: before that he worked for Waitrose and Sainsbury's. He's seen as a radical innovator in British food retail, one of the few who can envision a future where mass supermarket shopping is not all about stripped-down value and the endless drive to be cheapest. It's not, of course, a good time for this view: Esom left M&amp;S in July, and the company has since reported a six per cent drop in food sales.</p> <p>Given that, he's surprisingly optimistic about the future of fresh food as the recession begins to bite. 'We spend a lower proportion of our income on food than any other country in western Europe, and that proportion has dropped very fast over the past 20 years. But I think all the work that has been done in the past five or six years, by government, supermarkets and the media, means we're in much better position to understand the value of food. People genuinely want to buy local and organic - probably local first. The work that's being done in schools now will bear fruit - even my six-year-old daughter is coming home with a food diary as homework. All this will bring change for the better, for producers and consumers.'</p> <p>But for now? As stickers in the supermarkets scream 'Discount!' and farmers are closing up the chicken sheds? 'Well,' he sighs, 'you've got one set of retailers who care about quality and their customers and will do the right thing. And you've another set of retailers who don't. It is a dance.' </p> <h2>The supermarkets' response</h2> <p>During OFM's investigation into allegations of profiteering by supermarkets during the 18 months of soaring food price rises, we sent two questions to seven major retailers: Morrison's, Asda, Tesco, Sainsbury, Co-op (Scotland), Waitrose and Marks &amp; Spencer. Morrison's and Co-op decided not to respond. Some supermarkets responded after this month's Observer Food Monthly had gone to print.</p> <p><strong>Question 1:</strong> Can you assure the public that any rise in the price of staple foods in your shops over the last 18 months represents no more than the fair reflection of the rise in your costs and/or those of your suppliers? </p> <p><strong>Asda</strong><br>Absolutely. The rise in wheat and dairy prices over the last year or so has had a knock on effect on food prices. As always, we're dedicated to continually lowering prices - only last month we announced 5,000 price rollbacks from the weekly shopping basket. We run a lean business. By taking costs out of our supply chain and increasing efficiencies, we're able to maintain our position as Britain's best value retailer (Grocer). </p> <p><strong>Sainsbury</strong><br>It is not true to suggest that we have profiteered from cost price increases, we will remain competitive to offer our customers the best value and also remain committed to paying a fair price to all our suppliers.\"</p> <p><strong>Tesco</strong><br>Yes, we are working hard within the business to keep costs down. Just last week we announced a 3p cut off a litre of fuel so whenever we can make savings we pass these on to the customer. </p> <p><strong>Waitrose</strong><br>Yes we can. In fact the information we previously sent (see below) shows that in many categories we have absorbed a disproportionate amount of increasing farm gate prices ourselves without passing these on to our customers.</p> <p><strong>Marks &amp; Spencer</strong><br>Since July we have invested margin in price reductions, many of which are on a key range of every day items and staples where we are committed to delivering competitive pricing without increasing prices elsewhere to subsidise this. We have also adopted a more promotional stance to offer our customers better value. </p> <p><strong>Question 2:</strong> Most retailers have announced recent profit rises. If you have had an increase in (annual or six-monthly) profits on food sales, how is that explained? <br> <strong>Asda</strong><br>Over the past 12 months we've seen an increasing amount of shoppers coming through our doors. For example, the amount of AB shoppers coming to ASDA has increased by 12% - this has helped us achieve a good sales performance in a difficult climate.</p> <p><strong>M&amp;S</strong><br>Could not comment, because results were not due till November 4th. But it has been widely reported that food sales at M&amp;S are down about 6% on the year.  <strong>Tesco</strong><br>We understand the strain on the purse strings in the current climate and are doing everything we can to help, our Discounter range is a great quality, great value range which has been introduced to help customers at this difficult time. You will also notice that our trading profit margin in the UK has actually gone down from 5.90% to 5.85% from August 2007.</p> <p><strong>Waitrose</strong><br>At our latest interim results we didn't announce profit increases. However Waitrose takes a long term view and building long term sustainable relationships with our suppliers is vital to our business.</p> <p><strong>Sainsbury:</strong> <br>Did not respond.</p> <p><strong>M&amp;S made this extra statement:</strong> <br>We have an industry-leading position on paying a fair price to our suppliers. In 2005 - in an industry first, we launched the M&amp;S 'Milk Pledge' which guarantees our dairy farmers a fair price for milk, removing the uncertainty of the milk industry's price fluctuations so our dairy farmers have greater security. Last year we launched our industry-leading 'Lamb Pledge', which guarantees a fair price for the entire UK season, this was strongly supported by the British farming community and the NFU. We are also currently in discussions with our British pork farmers to establish a 'Pork Pledge' which again will guarantee a market leading price for the whole season <strong>Waitrose added a long dossier on its policies with suppliers. Here is part of it.</strong><br> Waitrose is investing in its supply chain for the long term and absorbing much of the increased farm gate prices to protect its farmers \u2013 and protect customers from price inflation. This is because the integrity of our supply chain and allowing our farmers to develop sustainable businesses is fundamental to the long-term success of the business.</p> <p>Cattle prices have risen by between 25% and 30% over the last 12 months. Although average retail prices have risen too, they have remained behind the increases seen for livestock. For much of the year they have averaged around 5% and 6%.</p> <p>The price that Waitrose has paid our dedicated farmers groups for UK Lamb have risen between 10% and 40% year on year over the period May to August 2008. The average retail prices have risen by 6-7%.</p> <p><strong>Examples of Waitrose supply model practice:</strong></p> <p><strong>Dairy</strong></p> <p>Waitrose Select Farm Milk Scheme: <br>The Waitrose Select Farm Scheme launched in 1999. The initiative is a long-term commitment between Waitrose, its supplier Dairy Crest and its forward-thinking group of dairy farmers. Waitrose has paid its farmers a premium in return for quality and after nearly a decade in operation, the effect on our supply chain is striking. The rate of investment in farms that supply Waitrose is now double the national average.</p> <p>Dairy Pricing at Waitrose:<br>The price we pay at our farmers reflects the costs they face, particularly with the increased cost of animal feeds. The Waitrose Select Farm Milk scheme involves working in partnership with farmers and elected farmer representatives to agree fair pricing, allowing Waitrose to consistently pay a market-leading price for its milk. Customers expect high quality food produced with high standards of animal welfare and environmental protection. In order for our Select Farm milk producers to achieve these high standards and enable them to make a return for their farm businesses, Waitrose will pay a higher price. </p> <p><strong>Beef</strong></p> <p>During 2007, Waitrose was unique in introducing a structured pricing system for its beef farmers. Farmers were given information about what prices they could expect from Waitrose each quarter, up to 18 months in advance. This meant they could plan their businesses and know exactly what income to expect from Waitrose. The scheme has been well received and is operating successfully. </p> <p><strong>Pork</strong></p> <p>At a time of crisis for the British pig industry, Waitrose has become the first major retailer to commit to buying all of its fresh pork and bacon from British farmers. Waitrose already sources 100% of its fresh pork and more than 90% of its bacon from the UK but plans a full-scale switch to British before the end of the year.</p> <p>The step is in stark contrast with the food retail industry in general which still sources large quantities of pork and bacon from overseas. Britain currently imports one third of its pork and nearly 60% of its bacon from systems that would not necessarily be legal in the UK.</p> <p>The Waitrose move comes as the British pig industry faces one of the most challenging times in its history with nine out of 10 pig farmers considering quitting for good. Farmers in the UK are currently losing around \u00a33 per pig, but Waitrose has a unique payment model for its pig farmers that takes into account the cost of production for the farmer. This ensures farmers receive sustainable and stable returns. The model has been described by BPEX (the British Pig Executive) as \"the closest thing to ideal within the industry\". </p> <p><strong>Chicken</strong></p> <p>Waitrose works with a dedicated group of chicken farmers, whom it knows and trusts. The farmer's costs for chicken feed and bedding are paid up front, meaning that they are protected from fluctuations in market prices. On top on this Waitrose pays a fair price for per kilo with farmers being rewarded for quality produce.</p> <p><strong>Eggs</strong></p> <p>Our egg supply chain is run by the Guild of Blacktail Columbian Farmers. (Black Tail Columbian hens are a variety of laying hen which are exclusive to Waitrose). We involve farmers in open and honest discussions on price. This body has an executive committee consisting of four farmer representatives and determines the price paid per dozen eggs.</p> <p><strong>Lamb</strong></p> <p>Waitrose supports its lamb farmers by paying them a premium for quality meat. When the lamb market collapsed last year, Waitrose took the decision to protect its supply chain by introducing a base level price which was 50 pence per kilo above the market rate. The market in 2008 is considerably stronger than in 2007, but Waitrose will continue to make significant investment to secure the continuity of supply for 2008 and the future. </p> <p>\u2022 Visit Word of Mouth, the OFM blog to join the debate: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2008/sep/24/asda.response.food.price.war\">Andy Bond, CEO of Asda and Alex Renton</a> on whether supermarkets are taking advantage of global price rises to increase profits; <a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/foodblog\">observer.co.uk/foodblog</a></p>",
  "<p><strong>Frieze week </strong><br>Various venues, London, ends today</p> <p>The great thing about the imminent possible crash in the art market is that there are no victims. By which I mean, there are no victims other than enormously rich people. Even better, some of the enormously rich people who may lose their shirts are bankers.</p> <p>It's hard, then, on the first morning of the Frieze art show, when the entire art market seems to be hanging in the balance, to really empathise in perhaps the way I should. Although I do feel a couple of pangs. Poor Gwyneth, for example. </p> <p>There she was, cruising the booths during the strictly VIP-only time slot - in fact there are five 'VIP' time slots, but 11am-1pm on the first day is strictly for billionaires, Guggenheim curators and Hollywood stars - when I stop her to ask for her opinion of what she thinks might happen to the art market. (I'd snuck in with Martin Parr, the celebrated Magnum photographer, who was my access-all-areas pass for the week.) </p> <p>'Are you a... reporter?' she says employing exactly the same intonation for 'reporter' as I might for, say, 'paedophile' with a tone of such utter world-weariness that, should she ever go for the method approach, will almost certainly be worth recalling if she's ever cast as a political prisoner, for example, who's been incarcerated in Stalin's gulag for the last 40 years. </p> <p>Then there was the owner of a small London gallery who desperately needs to go to lying classes before next dealing with the press. 'Have you sold anything?' I ask. 'Yes.' 'What?' 'Stuff.' 'Could you tell me exactly what?' 'No. I can't. Goodbye.'</p> <p>And Timothy Taylor and his wife Lady Helen Windsor - he's the owner of Timothy Taylor Gallery - whom, an hour into the fair, I ask for his opinion on the state of the market. 'It's not that I don't have an opinion. It's that I don't really want to tell it to you. We'll just have to wait and see.'</p> <p>'So you're sanguine?'</p> <p>'Yes, sanguine.'</p> <p>'Not nervous, then?'</p> <p>'Of course, I'm nervous.'</p> <p>'So, sanguine and nervous?' </p> <p>'Yes. Now if you'll excuse me.'</p> <p>And the director of Christie's, whom I nobbled at the Vanity Fair/Christie's party on Wednesday. The auction house is holding a big sale of contemporary art tonight, and nobody yet knows whether it will achieve record prices, or, more likely, be the beginning of what may come to be known as the Great Art Bloodbath. At the party, though, it was all non-stop flowing champagne and high brittle laughs, and wild, brushfire rumours, one of which I helped to start. </p> <p>The director of the second most important museum in the Netherlands told Martin Parr, who told me, who, in turn, quoted it to the senior director of Christie's: 'Make the most of it - it's the end of an era, it's going to be the last auction party for a very long time.' </p> <p>It felt a little bit cruel, repeating this to his face, to be honest. The auction houses have done their best to hype up prices as far as they'll go, and they won't get much sympathy from anyone if they do crash. But still. </p> <p>'No! I think there's going to be many of them for a long time to come!' he said with the kind of utterly unconvincing delivery of someone lying through their teeth that Gwyneth might want to study should she ever get to play, say, the chairman of a major merchant bank.</p> <p>It does feel like the end of an era, though. It has to be, doesn't it? If the whole financial world is going up in flames, how can art remain the only exception? At the Christie's party, I find myself taken under the wing of the legendary writer and art world observer, Anthony Haden-Guest, who gallantly sweeps me around the room ('Come on! Let's schmooze! More champagne!') and tells me that art is the canary in the coal mine, 'only the mine has collapsed and the canary's still singing'. </p> <p>When I tell him what the director of the second most important museum in the Netherlands said to Martin Parr, who told me, he says: 'Wow! Hello Scott Fitzgerald!' Although a better comparison, I realise when I get home and google him, is Tom Wolfe's Bonfire of the Vanities. Haden-Guest is widely believed to have been the model for Peter Fallow, the English journalist at the heart of the novel.</p> <p>And what greater bonfire of the vanities is there than the global contemporary art market? For greed and speculation and quite monumental displays of egotism, there's almost nothing to match it. It's been a magnet for masters-of-the-universe types, functioning as a sort of magical money machine - prices always go up! - and has trumped even property for no-effort-whatsoever returns since, in an amazing double-whammy, it simultaneously confers cultural prestige on whoever owns it.</p> <p>Art auctions are the ultimate free-market economies. They're capitalism at its purest - since art has no intrinsic value, it's simply worth whatever anyone is prepared to pay for it. A year and a half ago, I covered the London auction sales, for this newspaper, when record after record was broken. </p> <p>All art has boomed but none more so than contemporary - the art world's very own version of sub-prime. I had a week of Eighties flashbacks: Harry Enfield Loadsamoney types waving their arms around. Dr Sarah Thornton, an art insider who's just published the excellent Seven Days in the Art World, tells me that last year was pretty much what she now considers the absolute peak.</p> <p>'There's been records broken since, but May 2007 was the very height of it. There'd be 10-15 people bidding on every lot. The Russians had moved in. And the Abu Dhabi buyers and Qataris. And at that point the Americans were still buying. It was just total madness.'</p> <p>I'll say. Even the auction staff, while issuing press releases claiming works were bought by 'informed private buyers' and studiously avoiding words like 'rampant speculation' and 'over-inflated bubble', couldn't help making comparisons with the Eighties ('it's surpassed anything we saw back then'). When, to refresh your memory, the art world went crazy, crazy, crazy and then crashed and burnt.</p> <p>And it's this week that it's all come home to roost. The week of Frieze and the never-ending gallery parties, it was all anyone could talk of. Everybody who's anyone in the art world comes to Frieze. It's only been going since 2002 but now boasts 152 galleries from 27 countries. All the big collectors fly in. The museum curators. The billionaires. And the liggers, hanger-onners, professional partygoers, and the very thin, very blond women in heels and designer dresses who, in another context, I would assume to be prostitutes but who are actually either already married to hedge-fund managers or desperately trying to lock one down before they disappear as a species. </p> <p>Jessica Morgan, the curator of contemporary art at the Tate, tells me that it will all come clear in November at the New York sales, but this week's event at Frieze and the sales in the London auction houses this weekend are the first test. 'There's a lot of denial out there,' she says. 'The thing is that I'm about to be 40, so I have very distinct memories of the early Nineties. I left to go to the States because there were no opportunities here. But anybody younger than me has no memory of it. They think it's going to be fine, and it's not going to be fine. We're about to wake up into a very different world.' </p> <p>Just not quite yet. Every night this week there were private dinners for 150, vast parties, ridiculous attempts by anybody and everybody to jump aboard the art bandwagon while it's still the most glamorous show in town (Mulberry threw not one but two parties to showcase five exclusively designed 'totes' - to me and you, it's a shopping bag - designed by five artists you've never heard of). In Home House, a swanky private members' club, I chatted to Zaha Hadid at a glitzy party thrown in her honour by Lacoste, for whom she's designed some shoes, since everyone else seemed too cowed to (or possibly scared - at one point she barked at a man who might have been the chief executive of Lacoste to turn the music down). It's a bit unclear what it had to do with Frieze. Or why one of the world's leading architects would be designing shoes, for that matter. 'How did the collaboration with Lacoste come about?' I ask. She shrugs. 'They rang me up and offered me money.'</p> <p>The most hyped party of them all was White Cube's, thrown by London's trendiest gallery, the alma mater of Damien Hirst and Tracey Emin. The first person I see is Jefferson Hack, Kate Moss's ex (she turns up later), who's relating an anecdote about masturbation to someone, and I'm just taking in the demolition chic (it's in a Georgian townhouse in Soho, which is about to be turned into a hotel and filled with breeze-blocks and chandeliers and enormous double beds) when the PR gets stroppy and bans Martin from taking photos. 'But you're an art gallery,' I say. 'You support art.' </p> <p>But no, the fear seems to be that Martin Parr might be moonlighting for Heat. Which may tell you everything you need to know about White Cube and its position at the heart of the art-celebrity nexus.</p> <p>We head to its arch-competitor's do, instead, held by the Haunch of Venison (where they're up on their art: every time I catch sight of Martin he seems to be having his photo taken). Roman Abramovich and Dasha Zhukova are allegedly in attendance, although they somehow manage to evade being Gwyneth-ed by me. There's champagne and more champagne and margaritas, and models in courier outfits, complete with motorcycle helmets, patrolling the room offering the type of funky canap\u00e9 only an art party could come up with (pizza served out of a takeaway box) and hundreds upon hundreds of very thin, very blond non-prostitutes. Rafael Lozano-Hemmer, the hottest Mexican video artist of the moment, is DJing, and for six or more hours, more than 600 people attempt to drink the place dry.</p> <p>'Do you think it was like this in 1929?' a filmmaker called Chris Mitchell says to me. 'We're standing here as the entire world economy is collapsing and there's as much free booze as you could ever possibly want. We're in the land of unlimited excess, where it's all free champagne and lavish parties, and it's very hard to believe the government has just nationalised the banking system, isn't it?'</p> <p>It is. The conventional wisdom is that the art market is about 18 months behind the rest of the market but there are still people around who say things like, 'it's a safe haven, like gold'. Harry Blaine, the director of the Haunch of Venison - a man with a vested interest if ever there was one (he's about to open a vast new 35,000 square foot gallery in the old Museum of Mankind) - tells me that's rubbish. 'People cite \"the flight to art\" but of course it's going to be affected. The fact is that before everybody could call themselves a genius, myself included. Whereas now I think we're all going to have to be a bit more considered.'</p> <p>It's all about confidence. And it's waning. Pia Sarma, an art lawyer, tells me: 'There's been a huge upswing in legal work in the past six weeks, which is never a good sign. The galleries aren't paying the artists. They've got hugely overextended credit lines, and I'd say that there's quite a number of them who are in trouble.' </p> <p>And the mood, too, has gone - the appetite. Two very thin, very blond women, whose husbands are both in finance, tell me: 'We've been told specifically not to buy. Even if one could afford something, it would be poor taste at the moment to buy, wouldn't it? It'd be like wearing really flashy clothes.'</p> <p>It's not a sell-out, that's for sure, like other years. The big galleries are still doing solid business, the small ones less so. There are still people buying. I bump into Sultan Al-Qassemi, a commentator and member of the Sharjah royal family, whom I met two weeks ago in Dubai, and he tells me excitedly how he's just bought a piece. During the week, the beginnings of a consensus emerges: the top of the market just might pull through, but the middle and lower end looks precarious. </p> <p>But still, what a rollercoaster ride it has been, the last decade. And the culmination of everything, of the record prices, and the frenzied sales, and the phenomenon of artists-as-celebrities, came at the very moment that everything else began to collapse. On the day Lehman Brothers went down the pan, Damien Hirst defied all expectations at the Sotheby's auction with his work going for an unprecendented \u00a3111m.</p> <p>Conspiracy theories abound. Why did the chairman of rival auction house Christie's buy the top lot? Was he trying to keep the market propped up? Was White Cube secretly on commission after all? But you have to hand it to Hirst. He pulled it off. Steve Lazarides, Banksy's agent, tells me he was in New York for an exhibition the day the bank went down. 'And I just put the duvet over my head, and thought, \"We're totally fucked!\" But actually we're up and up and up.'</p> <p>For how much longer, though? Not even the artists seem to want it. I speak to at least half a dozen who would welcome a return to more realistic prices. Grayson Perry tells me about an artist he knows whose paintings are now worth so much 'he's almost too constipated to paint, because he knows every brushstroke is worth thousands of pounds'. 'It's not good for you, for your work,' he argues, 'where everything you do has value, any little doodle. I call it the Picasso Napkin Syndrome.' </p> <p>And anyway, he says, a crash might see off some of 'the hair gel people'. Hair gel people? 'You know the chancers and Johnny-come-latelys who've been attracted by the celebrities and glamour.' </p> <p>Ah yes, the glamour. A German artist called Via Lewandowsky tells me his theory that art is a parallel religious system, and Damien Hirst is its Jesus. What differentiates it here from Berlin? The glamour, he says. What does that even mean? I ask. 'Your churches are better equipped,' he says. Eh? 'Your parties, your galleries, they're all so much... more.'</p> <p>They are. Or, at least, they were. We don't yet know how Frieze 2008 and its parties and dinners and rococo excess will one day be viewed, but at the art coalface - pressed hard up against a nicely chilled glass of champagne - it felt like the beginning of the end.</p> <h2>Frieze 2008: Top five</h2> <p>Smoking booths, bars and tattooed pigs...

  "<p>If, after 30 years of effort, the only solution on offer to a problem is to 'try harder', you know there's something wrong with the premise. So it is with City pay. The credit crunch has written it out in huge red letters: incentive pay may work for Chinese peasants, but in situations of any complexity, and especially where the quality of the decisions made is only apparent in the long term, pay that truly reflects performance is not only unachievable: the attempt to make it so is catastrophically counterproductive. </p> <p>In a recent interview, ex-Lloyds TSB chairman Sir Brian Pitman disarmingly noted that banking was essentially a simple commodity business. Unless you are brilliant at identifying undervalued assets (ie, you are Warren Buffett) or a venture capitalist who can transform an idea into an income stream, the only way to bump up profits is by taking greater systemic risk (known as 'beta' in the trade). </p> <p>If, in the first half of this decade, British banks have been colossally profitable, it is because highly incentivised bankers have devised ever more complex instruments to disguise risk as value creation ('alpha'). The crunch may have dramatically revealed the difference between the two, but the bonuses have already been paid. Systemically, high profits, high pay and high risks go together; and they do so because - an exquisite irony - as long as banks act in unison, they will be underwritten by a tacit but iron-clad state guarantee. </p> <p>As Martin Wolf wrote in that well-known socialist organ the Financial Times, 'either banking should be treated as a utility, with regulated returns, or it should be viewed as a profit-seeking industry that operates in accordance with the laws of the market, including, if necessary, mass redundancies'. Since the latter is unacceptable, he concluded, we have to move towards the former - and regulation must include pay above all.</p> <p>In this context, the dire warnings from the free-market champions about the perils of interfering with today's pay-setting methods take on a surreal air. If companies and shareholders really are 'better at setting salaries than bureaucrats', as The Economist affirms, given that 'better' has resulted in the almost complete meltdown of the global financial system, what, please, would 'worse' look like? </p> <p>The same objection applies to the argument that paying bankers less would choke off innovation. If this is innovation, give us less of it. Let's be clear: the cause of the crisis is not impersonal economic entities such as capital flows, asset bubbles or credit default swaps; it is the behaviour of human beings strongly incentivised to devise fake innovations, and pass off 'beta' as 'alpha', in ways that, as a torrent of impending investigations and court cases will soon show, were on the very edge of legality if not beyond it. </p> <p>As for the final argument, the tired old threat that if City folk aren't paid 10 times more than anyone else they'll leave - let them. Bloated way beyond 'normal' size, in bubbles of their own, the City and Wall Street were destined to deflate anyway as the economy rebalances away from financial smoke and mirrors towards the boring, neglected tasks of long-term investment, innovation and organisation-building. </p> <p>Beyond that, the offshore island that is financial services needs re-attaching to the real economy. One way of doing this is via pay. Since the bureaucrats are now shareholders, we have a one-time chance to do so. As Will Hutton has noted, despite official disclaimers, the government is in the business of running banks, whether it likes it or not. It has already told them to stop paying dividends and start lending again.</p> <p>But it should also be thinking far more radically about pay. It's the whole system of corporate governance, based on aligning executives and shareholders, that's broken. That's what we've been trying vainly to make work for 30 years. It's time to face up to the evidence: it is simply a recipe for increasing pay whatever the performance. This year, FTSE 100 CEOs' pay climbed by a 'gravity-defying' 11.5 per cent, according to IDS. And, bang on cue, the FT reported last week that companies are already softening performance targets ahead of the downturn.</p> <p>The government should take on board what a slew of top-performing companies have known for years - internal equity in pay is more important than external. Directors shouldn't be aligned with shareholders: they should be aligned with the company as a whole. If that puts off some candidates, fine. John Lewis has no trouble attracting good people despite limits on top pay and bonuses that are shared equally. Whole Foods Market (publicly quoted, note) is even more extreme, paying its top people no more than 19 times its least paid.

  "<p>Twenty-five years ago, when Margaret Thatcher was in Number 10, recession meant factory gates clanging shut in the industrial heartlands of the North and the Midlands. Government figures are expected to confirm this week that a new recession has already begun: but this time it's different. Its centre is hundreds of miles farther south, in London; and rather than sclerotic, strike-bound heavy industry, it is the banks, whose go-getting drive symbolised the capital's economic renaissance, that have gone cap in hand to the taxpayer. In the Brown recession, it will quite definitely be grim down south.</p> <p>'It's definitely a south of England thing,' says Peter Spencer, economic adviser to the Ernst and Young Item Club. 'The downturn is in the City, most obviously. The initial shock hit anything to do with the credit markets; but we're now looking at a second leg, which is to do with the collapse in share prices. From the south of England's point of view, that means a whole swath of businesses that feed off the equity market will suffer.' From hoteliers to lawyers, cleaners to management consultants, the drying up of big-money deals in the capital will trigger a surge of business failures and unemployment.</p> <p>When Mrs Gaskell wrote her novel North and South in the mid-nineteenth century, the manufacturing powerhouses of Leeds and Manchester drove the economy. But since the Jarrow March in 1936, economic hardship and the North have been entwined. In the Eighties the region became almost synonymous with recession as dock workers, miners and manufacturers lost their jobs in droves, pushing the dole queue above three million. Harry Enfield's character 'Loadsamoney,' a crass Cockney, and his Geordie opposite 'Bugger-All Money', satirised the deep divide with the prosperous South. This recession, though, will strike at the aspirational heartlands of the south-east, hitting bankers, buy-to-let landlords, estate agents and a host of service industries that have grown up around the finance and property boom.</p> <p>The early Nineties recession took its toll on the South with negative equity, home repossessions, white-collar job-losses and small business failures. But it was only a foretaste of the misery heading south this time. Economists from right-wing think tank Policy Exchange argued recently that northerners should up sticks, because their home region was unlikely ever to recover from the devastation of the Thatcher years. London and its hinterlands, however, are braced for a dose of what the North has already endured. In our post-industrial economy, the service sector is a crucial source of prosperity. A recent analysis by the HSBC bank revealed that almost one in four of Britain's workforce, 23 per cent, are employed in retail or leisure, the sectors next in the firing line.</p> <p>London Mayor Boris Johnson's economic advisers issued their latest prognosis on the capital last week, with a grim warning that cash-strapped households are likely to be forced to cut back their spending for the next two years. That would be the first outright fall in spending since the early-Nineties recession. 'London's economic performance may well be more sensitive to the ongoing dislocation and job losses in the financial markets than the rest of the UK,' they said, predicting two years of falling employment and weak growth.</p> <p>The call is now out for the capital to recalibrate its job market by boosting manufacturing, creative industries, health and education. 'We do need to go down this path,' said Tony Travers, director of the Greater London Group at the London School of Economics.</p> <p>James Purnell, the work and pensions secretary, said he expected future unemployment to be different from the Eighties, when job losses were concentrated outside the south-east and largely felt by unskilled workers. He said: 'If you look at the picture of employment and unemployment, it was [in the Eighties] very unevenly spread.' Purnell said that this time it would spread more evenly and would affect the middle class.</p> <p>Department store chain John Lewis, the bastion of middle England, is already seeing a drop in sales, and supermarkets are reporting that newly price-conscious consumers are turning away from costly organic ranges, and plumping for own-brand bargains instead. Discounter Aldi, which drew large crowds to its new store in Hull earlier this month, boasts that it is tempting shoppers away from Waitrose, Tesco and M&amp;S.</p> <p>Fears that Londoners are tightening their belts are backed up by evidence from researchers at SPSL, who track the number of shoppers hitting high streets up and down the country. They say the south-east saw a drop in the number of consumers in stores in September, compared with the same month last year, while shoppers were still flocking to northern England and Wales.</p> <p>One reason for the evaporation of optimism in the capital may be the rapid pace of job losses. Unemployment is rising at its fastest rate for 18 years, and a breakdown of official figures shows that lay-offs so far have been heavily concentrated in the South. London and the south-east have accounted for more than half of the job losses in the country between June and August.</p> <p>Graham Capper of London First, the lobby group funded by the capital's biggest companies, said: 'When bankers, traders, accountants and lawyers fall on their swords they're not going to sign on for jobseeker's allowance. What happens is when they feel less successful, they spend less on shopping and services.' </p> <p>Howard Archer, expert on the UK economy at consultancy Global Insight, says the downturn is spreading into some unlikely corners. 'The services sector is not just financial services and the City. Estate agents are being hit really hard - and people like personal trainers will be suffering, too. Apart from debt collection and repossession - and maybe pawnbrokers - few areas will be completely immune.'</p> <p>The South, too, has been bearing the brunt of the house price crash. Prices are falling right across the country; but apart from Northern Ireland, where the downturn began earlier, the worst-hit areas are East Anglia and the south-west, where prices are so far down by more than 10 per cent from their peak, closely followed by the south-east and outer London. And in the pockets where financial services professionals are especially concentrated, things are even worse. Lucian Cook, director of research at upmarket estate agent Savills, says family-sized homes in some of the plush areas of west London favoured by investment bankers have already dropped in price by an extraordinary 17 per cent since the beginning of the year.</p> <p>'We're talking about anywhere from Fulham to Richmond,' he said. 'This is a service sector recession, and job losses in the City are having quite an impact.' </p> <p>In many areas further north, meanwhile, away from the estate agents' windows, it is business as usual. Damian Waters is the regional director for the north-west branch of the CBI. He says: 'We are not immune from the downturn in financial services, as Manchester, for example, has a high proportion of financial institutions. But the north-west is a very diverse economy.'</p> <p>He insists that most manufacturers have not so far noticed a drop-off in demand, and that factories are running at full tilt: 'The problem is capacity and how to fulfil orders.' He added they were also benefiting from the recent fall in gas and electricity prices as well as a weaker pound, which makes exports more competitive.</p> <p>High-profile regeneration projects such as the Sage music centre in Gateshead, and the Lowry gallery and theatre in Salford, have helped to transform former industrial cities, bringing long-abandoned buildings back into use as bars and loft apartments, and attracting a new generation of young professionals back into town centres.</p> <p>Of course, a rising tide doesn't lift all boats, and although parts of the North have reinvented themselves, there are pockets which are still reeling from the industrial devastation of the Thatcher era. The north-east pit village of Easington Colliery is known as the UK's incapacity benefit capital. The former working class community in Co Durham has been an unemployment blackspot since the closure of the mine, with more than 8,000 out of a population of 81,000 claiming sick pay. Nearby, in Teesside, the deprived former dock area of Middlesbrough, Middlehaven, is bedevilled by unemployment, and in 2006 was found to have the lowest life expectancy in England at just 67.8 years. </p> <p>In the former coalfield regions, hundreds of millions of pounds has been poured in to build industrial estates, new roads and retrain hundreds of thousands of people thrown out of work. 'We have still got health problems, access to service problems, and education and skills problems. It's very deeply entrenched,' said Janet Bibby, chief executive of the Coalfields Regeneration Trust. 'There are still three generations of unemployed. If we stop now we will lose ground.'</p> <p>While the recent City job losses have commandeered hundreds of column inches, more than a million manufacturing workers have been made redundant over the past decade, almost unnoticed by the wider world. Now, some in the Cinderella sector of manufacturing hope one positive outcome of this white-collar recession could be a resurgence of interest in industry. Dougie Rooney, national officer for energy for the Unite union, met officials from the Department of Business last week to discuss how people who have lost their jobs in the City could retrain to work in manufacturing or the energy sector.</p> <p>As the multi-billion-pound nuclear building programme gets under way, he wants the government to promise to buy British whenever it can, to create new jobs and compensate for a shrinking finance sector. 'We need to get more people into the energy sector. Some of these people losing their jobs in the City will have degrees in maths or chemistry. I'm not saying we'll go back to the days when you open the factory gates and 10,000 people walk in. But there are plenty of manufacturing, design and energy companies who can make the kit we need - they just need the signal from the government,' he says.</p> <p>The London-centric bias of the economy is likely to reassert itself once the recession is over, but even David Cameron's Conservatives now accept that we need a better balance between regions and between finance and industry. The longer the downturn goes on, the less chance there is of any region escaping unscathed. But the topsy-turvy, white-collar recession is an Exocet aimed straight at the pockets of the comfortable southern middle-classes. The poor will suffer too, but the Brown slump will destroy the old certainty that recessions don't happen to People Like Us.</p> <h2>Britain then and now</h2> <p><strong>The charts</strong></p> <p><strong>1981</strong> Adam and the Ants have their first number one with 'Stand and Deliver'.</p> <p><strong>2008</strong> Teenagers download Pink's 'So What', sending it to the top of the charts.</p> <p><strong>The TV</strong></p> <p><strong>1981</strong> Kids are watching Dangermouse and his sidekick, Penfold, and are about to discover Postman Pat</p> <p><strong>2008</strong> Talent shows Strictly Come Dancing and The X Factor grip the nation.</p> <p><strong>The fashion</strong></p> <p><strong>1981</strong> It's all about pixie boots, shoulder pads and jeans with zippers on the sides.</p> <p><strong>2008</strong> Skinny jeans, bright clashing colours and jumpsuits are back in vogue.

  "<p>This is where I work, but it's more like a second home to me, really. When I decided to move here from my old studio in Bloomsbury five years ago, I did think about having a 'proper' office for my design company (I'm the creative director), but the first one I looked at was a horror. So I bought this two-storey apartment in south London. </p> <p>Downstairs is a darker, more private space where I read and think, and this upstairs area is the design studio I share with 12 colleagues. I love the idea of having people work in an environment that feels like home, and here we can enjoy all the things about it that are good, like a proper kitchen. We eat together, both in here and up on the roof. The building is near the brilliant Borough food market, so we have easy access to good ingredients. I'm a great believer in the conviviality of shared meals. I try and eat in here with clients, too, as it creates a completely different, more relaxed atmosphere. </p> <p>I don't have a desk. I'm always working with other people, sitting with them round a table. My work is all about people and talking - I'm not a lone genius. I think the desk as a piece of status furniture is totally overegged. I have avoided proper office furniture, so the table is just a basic trestle. I didn't economise on the chairs, though. The swivel ones in here are by Eames. </p> <p>The studio had to be white. The work that passes through brings in lots of colour, so we needed a plain backdrop to keep our heads clear. It makes the most of the light as well, which means you get a real sense of being part of the outside. I think that's massively important: buildings should feel part of their surroundings.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"mailto:www.studioilse.com\">studioilse.com</a></strong></p>",
  "<p>In Rochester, Northumberland, the last village before Scotland, Rupert Mitford, the 6th Baron Redesdale, and Paul Parker, a pest controller, are examining a map. We are in Redesdale's kitchen, in a cottage that borders the Otterburn army base. Chinook helicopters fly low up the valley, the last stop before Helmand and Basra. Redesdale and Parker, however, are organising battle lines of their own. </p> <p>Redesdale, in a lived-in tweed jacket, eventually locates his home on the well-used Ordnance Survey. 'This house was ground zero,' he says. 'In the first six months we had cleared everything to here,' he gestures towards a wooded area to the south. 'May to June we got down to this line here. July we did Newcastle.'</p> <p>Parker, shaven headed, chips in, in his broad Geordie, tracing his finger along the Tyne. 'We were doing the damage in this area. They can swim, but they'd rather use the bridges. We hammered them here and here and here. Now we are really hunting them down in ones and twos.'</p> <p>Redesdale continues, with boyish excitement. 'We developed what we called our killing strategy. Hit them in the woods. Dipton Woods: we took 2,000 out. If you clear a woodland you suck all the surrounding population to it. Then you hit them again. Suck 'em in, hit them.'</p> <p>'Slaley Forest,' Parker says. 'We took 3,500 out of there. In the winter there's no cover and you can pick them off with the .22 rifle. They all get together in the cold. You can get eight or nine with a couple of shots. All huddled together. We just annihilated them.'</p> <p>Redesdale is a tall, consummately charming, slightly distracted man, who attended public schools in north London and studied archaeology at Newcastle. He can trace his bloodline back to the Norman conquests; the Mitford sisters were his great aunts. Having been relieved of his hereditary peerage in Blair's reforms, he became the youngest elected life peer and is now, at 41, the Liberal Democrat spokesman for the environment in the second chamber. Parker, who grew up in the west end of Newcastle, was not much for school. Once he was seven or eight he was off in the fields, rabbiting, shooting crows and starlings and selling them to local butchers for pies. He and Redesdale, who rents him a house up the road, are an unlikely double act. Together, camouflaged crusaders, they form the Red Squirrel Protection Partnership.</p> <p>This is not a resurgent Tufty Club. 'We only call ourselves the Red Squirrel Protection Partnership because if we called it the Grey Squirrel Annihilation League people might be a bit less sympathetic,' Redesdale announces, chuckling. 'But we do nothing with red squirrels apart from save them by killing grey squirrels!' </p> <p>In the two years of their existence, Redesdale and Parker have been remarkably successful. While other conservation groups go in for education or re-habitation, they favour genocide. With a recruited army of 900 volunteers - grannies and game wardens, families and farmers - they have slaughtered 19,500 grey squirrels in the past 18 months and claim to have cleared England's northernmost county of the rodent. The grannies, Redesdale suggests, tend to be the most bloodthirsty trappers. 'It's like: \"Can you beat it to death with a hammer and let me watch?\" We had one old dear who went inside and came back out with a sort of elephant gun: \"Do you want to shoot it with this?\"'</p> <p>Parker and Redesdale are now making plans for Yorkshire, if they can find funding. Parker really dreams, however, of getting down to London, 'taking out - what is it? - Hampstead Heath, the parks. Hit them in their own backyard.' This, Redesdale adds, despite the fact that his partner gets a nosebleed if he leaves Northumberland, and on the one occasion he tried London had a panic attack on the tube. Even so, the baron does not rule out the capital. Lately, he confesses, he has been testing kill traps in Tufnell Park.</p> <p>I first met Redesdale a few weeks earlier, in the House of Lords' tearoom. There he explained how his private army came together. A couple of years ago, he said, he felt he had been lacking purpose in his life. He had the peerage, his work, his wife, Helen (a lawyer), four wonderful kids, a house in north London, and the cottage and several hundred tenanted acres in the valley that bears his name, but he was lying awake wondering about the meaning of it all. 'Now,' he said, trying to suppress a giggle, 'I lie awake working out how to kill squirrels.'</p> <p>A man needs a hobby. In this case it began when Redesdale was asked to make a speech in the Lords about the plight of the red squirrel in March 2006. He had spent every summer of his childhood, the second youngest of seven children, and the only boy, in the woods around the cottage in Rochester; since these were strongholds of the red squirrel he knew a good deal about the subject. Most of all he knew, as every English schoolboy knew, how the native red thoroughbreds had been forced back by the rapacious American greys and now stood on the edge of extinction.</p> <p>The debate itself proved a catalyst in Redesdale's thinking. It was moved by Earl Peel, who described the red squirrel as 'an iconic creature, immortalised by Beatrix Potter'. These days, however, Peel went on, 'Squirrel Nutkin must think to himself, \"How could it have all gone so wretchedly wrong for me?\" Why couldn't he, like Tommy Brock, have employed a top public relations firm and secured himself as a logo for a major conservation body?' </p> <p>The grey squirrel was presented by Peel as the scourge of all right-thinking people, carrier of the brutal squirrel pox which wiped out any reds that came into contact with it in days. A scavenger, it was the black-eyed destroyer of trees and bird populations. Peel ended with an impassioned plea. 'Walking as I do through St James's Park from time to time, I cannot help noticing the absence of common or garden birds. Where are the tits?' he asked. 'Where are the warblers?'</p> <p>Redesdale picked up in the debate where Peel had left off. 'In Regent's Park,' he began, 'a grey squirrel came up to my son and me and actually climbed up my leg to look in my pocket...' Before he was able to add 'in search of nuts', Lord Hoyle butted in. 'In St James's Park one ran up my trouser leg and bit me!'</p> <p>These peer-bothering trouser rats were even now on the march. 'I have some woodland in Northumberland that has red squirrels,' Redesdale went on. 'Last year, however, we found our first grey squirrel - it had been killed in the road - so it will surely not be too long before the grey squirrels arrive. I am just on the edge of Kielder Forest, and it is very depressing to think that that last bastion is under threat...'</p> <p>Of course, no pillar of the establishment likes to see bastions threatened and this roused others to the fray. Lady Saltoun of Abernethy, who had red squirrels dancing on the lawns of her estate, had no doubt what we were dealing with. 'Red squirrels are rather like quiet, well-behaved people,' she observed, 'who do not make a nuisance or an exhibition of themselves, or commit crimes, and so do not get themselves into the papers in the vulgar way grey squirrels do.'</p> <p>The grey squirrels' celebrity-seeking hoodie behaviour was the least of it. Battalions of vulgarian American rodents were fanning out across Europe. Lord Chorley, who wondered if he might be the only member present who had taken tea with Beatrix Potter herself, in 1941 (she put him in mind of Mrs Tiggy-Winkle), spoke darkly of how, contrary to what the New Labour government had recently claimed, grey squirrels were right now massing on the continent. 'There are three colonies, if that is the right word, in Italy. At least one of them is in the process of crossing the Alps. If they get to Germany there will be a complete invasion taking place.'</p> <p>By the time Lord Inglewood took the floor, emotion was running high. 'Squirrels are said to be good to eat,' he declared. 'The great chef Brillat-Savarin created a banquet of grey squirrels stewed in Madeira, together with partridge wings en papillote and roast turkey.' Mr Jamie Oliver had to be summoned. Inglewood finished with a stirring call to arms. 'The red squirrels have had Chamberlains and not Churchills!' he cried. 'But it is Churchills that they need!'</p> <p>Cometh the hour, cometh the man. Rupert Redesdale is far from a bloodthirsty fellow - he had never killed anything in anger since he had been on Operation Raleigh in Africa in his gap year and it had been his turn to throttle a chicken - but something about the squirrels' plight stirred old emotions in his blood. He was a Mitford after all.</p> <p>It was, he decided, not just the pox that was killing red squirrels, it was bureaucracy. A whopping \u00a3626,000 of Lottery money had recently been awarded to a group called Save our Squirrels, drawn from various nature conservation agencies, but the money had been given on the understanding that none of it would be used to pursue what seemed to be the only hope of salvation for the beleaguered native rodent: it could not be spent on culling greys. </p> <p>Redesdale spoke to the relevant office at Defra to point out the absurdity of this. There were more than 2m greys and only, at best, 160,000 reds. Appeasement was not an option. Defra suggested to him that as they were coming to the end of their budgetary year there might be some funds available. So Redesdale sat up over the following weekend and produced a grant application. It was a strange kind of document. In the space marked 'turnover' he wrote 'nil', in that for 'product' he listed 'dead squirrels'. Still, he got the money, nearly \u00a3150,000 of it, and then sat at his kitchen table and worked out how best to spend it.</p> <p>The original plan was to start lots of little squirrel groups all over the county, spread the word about the danger and get people to start trapping. In the event, Redesdale, a man who never quite seems in control of his laughter, found he was spending more time on team-building than on carnage. Save our Squirrels wanted to be involved. They had four full-time squirrel preservation officers who came to meetings. </p> <p>There was much discussion about whether it was possible to use the 'k' word - 'cull was OK, kill apparently was not,' Redesdale recalls. There was fear of reprisals. At the first board meeting of the RSPP they spent an hour discussing what they would do when the first death threat came in. 'We decided we were quite lucky because they had just arrested most of the Animal Liberation Front,' Redesdale remembers. (They have so far received four letters of complaint, one suggesting a grey squirrel zoo.)</p> <p>Just when he was starting to despair, however, Redesdale met Paul Parker. The pest controller was of the opinion that 'you can be through the area and have cleared it of squirrels by the time you have bought the biscuits for a coffee morning'. They worked on a new foolproof trap, and found a local man to knock up 1,000 in his shed. And it was then, Redesdale recalls, that they really started motoring.</p> <p>There are some pest control vans that favour discretion. The kind that, if parked in a restaurant car park, might keep the patrons guessing about their purpose. Paul Parker's van is not one of those. On back and sides, in the largest possible type, are the words 'Bees, wasps, bed bugs, squirrels, fleas, cockroaches, rodents, rabbits. You hate them, we love them!' There is, too, a squirrel hotline number. If a grey is spotted anywhere in the county, Parker will be on its case immediately with his traps and his rifles. In this way, he reckons, he has been covering up to 4,000 miles in a week.</p> <p>At any moment his phone could ring and we could be off to Hexham or Corbridge. From six in the morning people start calling and they don't stop until late at night. 'At 11 o'clock they've just come in from work, and there's a squirrel in the trap, they want me to shoot it. I can have 10 to do before I wake up in the morning.'</p> <p>This morning, however, Parker's phone is stubbornly silent. There is, it seems, not a squirrel to be shot for 50 miles in any direction. We set off anyway on Parker's regular rounds, checking traps for nuts, catching up with his volunteer army, and while we drive he recounts tales of more memorable mornings. There was the drive-by shooting near Blaydon: 'We were doing about 40 and there's a grey by the side of the road, brushing its hair: I lined him up with the air rifle, bang, straight through the chest.' And Stumpy, the last grey in Slayley, who had lost half his tail. 'He was a swine, took us a couple of weeks to get him. We just fed him, waited until he eventually dropped his guard, and then: bam!'</p> <p>Parker is a superstitious man. In particular he will not pronounce the name of his most resolute adversary. When they crop up in conversation, rats are thus always 'long tails' or 'tin hats'. ('Pig' and 'monkey' are problematic words for him in this regard, too.) As we drive over bridges, he somewhat disconcertingly lifts his feet from the car's pedals. 'Devil's water,' he says. </p> <p>Mrs Sanderson, in Hexham, is a kindly looking woman, and at 82 the oldest volunteer in the RSPP. She is also among its most successful squirrel catchers. Over the past year or so she has taken about 40 squirrels from the trap under her bird table, though more, she muses, if you count all the nursing mothers among them. 'There would be the starving little ones with those, too, I suppose.'</p> <p>She remembers the days when the reds used to come to the back door of her council house. She hasn't seen one for years, but at least the traps give her something to watch with her breakfast. 'You are just willing them to get in there,' she says of the greys, 'when they come sniffing around, destroying everything.' At first, when Parker came to shoot a squirrel she wouldn't watch. But now she does. 'I give him a bag to carry them out in, too,' she explains. 'Actually it's one from the RSPCA.'</p> <p>I mention that a colony of unusually large black squirrels, a colour mutation of the grey, is establishing a stronghold in Cambridgeshire, because the females there seem to prefer the muscular new breed. Mrs Sanderson winces at the idea. Last night she dreamt that she opened her front door and there were two red squirrels on the steps there talking to her. 'They will come,' Parker reassures her, 'don't you worry.' Since the grey squirrel cull, red squirrels have started re-establishing themselves all over the county. One was recently seen in Jesmond Park in Newcastle. 'It gives people round here hope,' Parker observes, 'and they will be back here, too.'</p> <p>We wander out to inspect Mrs Sanderson's trap, in vain. We move on, scanning the horizon, in search of the last grey squirrel in Northumberland. </p> <p>By mid-afternoon we are at a quarry with Reg Ord, another member of Lord Redesdale's squirrel army. Ord, 42, is an infamous bouncer in Newcastle's Bigg Market (a 'nightclub ejection technician,' he suggests). As broad as he is tall, with a neck like a sack of cement, Ord's day job is manning a Tarmac weighbridge. The company gives him an hour a day for conservation projects - the certificates are on the walls of his Portakabin. In corners of the quarried land Ord thus puts out strips of tin to attract newts - 'mostly palmates', Ord says, 'plus the odd great-crested' - and he shoots squirrels. He's had 500 since he started, just around the site here, but none today.</p> <p>Parker suggests this is a sign they are winning, but Ord is not happy. Thing is, someone has been messing with his traps. Stamping on them, driving over them. He shows us the flattened items at the back of his Portakabin, all the while recounting tales of his history as a doorman. 'I've been shot at and stabbed and hit with lumps of wood and bricks and bottles. They only ever try it once, mind. Bloke phoned me up three in the morning, told me how he was going to shoot me, the calibre of the rifle and all. The police wanted me to wear a vest, but I had an idea who it was. Next time he came in the bar I really gave it to him...' Ord recalls the encounter with some relish. 'Had no calls since.'</p> <p>If you had a hankering to liberate grey squirrels, I can't help thinking, it is probably not Reg Ord's squirrel traps that you would choose to stamp on first. Does he have an idea who is doing it?</p> <p>'I've got my suspicions, but you cannot prove nowt. I'll find out though. And when I find the fucker, he'll have it, too.'</p> <p>We drive on. Parker's phone sits on the seat beside him, mute. The story is the same with all the other trappers we meet. On the way home, at the bridge near Corsham, after a squirrel-free day, Parker lifts his feet from the car pedals. 'Devil's water,' he says.</p> <p>The longer you spend in Northumberland the more you realise what a very long way from anywhere else it is. The Observer's photographer, Gary Calton, and I are staying in a curious country house hotel in Otterburn that was recently converted into a hostel for asylum seekers. When there was a local protest at the prospect of the incomers, however, it reverted to being a hotel. We are the only guests. They are preparing for a wedding at the weekend, at which all of the party will be dressed in orangutan costumes.</p> <p>Overnight, I begin to develop a theory that the suspicion about incomers has also fuelled some of the zeal of the squirrel operation. The greys, adaptable and robust, are evidence of Darwin in action. They hugely outbreed the reds - four to eight in a litter, three or four times a year. They also out-eat them. Reds, vegetarians, need a lot of seeds. The greys will eat anything. They will take mince pies from children's hands. In Scotland they will drink Irn Bru. There was a story of squirrels addicted to crack cocaine in Brixton. </p> <p>If there is a class war aspect to this struggle, the aristocracy brought it on themselves. The first grey squirrels came to Britain as amusing mementoes of the New World in the early 19th century. The gentry kept them in cages as pets. It is thought that in 1876 a Mr Brocklehurst, who had brought a pair over from America, released them to see how they would fare in the wild. </p> <p>With all of this in mind I go to sleep thinking even the House of Lords can't stop evolution. The following morning, though, Redesdale puts me right. </p> <p>'Your problem is that you have never seen a red squirrel,' he says. And it's true, I haven't. 'The first time you see a red squirrel you will get it immediately. The hairs stand up on your neck. Half the primates in the world are about to go extinct and here is an extraordinary animal native to this country that is about to disappear because we can't be bothered to save it. Paul and I have proved it can be done. The RSPCA says what we do, though legal, is unethical; Save our Squirrels call us cowboys. But how can it possibly be ethical to let a wonderful native animal be lost to future generations for ever?'</p> <p>Parker, still in his combat gear, is teary-eyed when it comes to reds.</p> <p>'I think they are mystical animals. There is something so spirited about them; I saw my first one back in the Seventies, but every time they still affect me the same way. To think they have been here since the Ice Age and we might be seeing the last of them here is something I really don't want to think about.'</p> <p>The news has been carrying items about how the ancient red squirrel population in Formby, Lancashire, has been quickly devastated by squirrel pox with the arrival of the grey. The conservation groups had given red squirrels 10 years in Northumberland; Redesdale reckons they had four, tops. Now at least they have a fighting chance. 'We have to keep vigilant,' he says, 'have to keep pushing the greys back.' </p> <p>Having failed to find a grey squirrel to shoot yesterday, today we are going in search of a red squirrel to photograph. The grounds of Eshott Hall in the northeast of the county are considered a good bet. For several hours, therefore, Gary and me and Paul Parker and Redesdale study the tree canopy for the movement of red squirrels - unlike the grey they rarely come to ground, and when they do they move like quicksilver.</p> <p>Eventually, with legs cramping up, we spot a pair high up in the tree under which we are crouching, whispering. Redesdale and Parker are right, it is a perfectly charged moment (though partly a relief to see any squirrel at all). Smaller than the greys, the red squirrels chase each other across the high branches. When they sense us they stop stock-still, and then they chatter furiously. Parker says it has been like this on the few occasions he has had a red in the traps. When he has let it go it has been away like liquid, but has always stopped halfway up a tree to fix him with a stare and chunter at top speed. 'It's like, \"Hey mate, you got the wrong man there.\"'</p> <p>Watching these squirrels Parker becomes reverential, almost spooked. 'The greys are just tin hats really. They are nothing like the reds. You see a red and every one is different, they have individual characters. Sharp eyes, little tufts on their ears. They respect the place they live in. A grey squirrel is just a grey squirrel.'</p> <p>Wondering whether it is possible for a squirrel to show respect, we leave Eshott and go in search of a fabled man who feeds red squirrels from his hand in Kielder Forest. We are led to his cottage at the side of Kielder Lake by word of mouth. Everyone knows the squirrel man. And when we get there we immediately see why he has his reputation.</p> <p>Having spent most of the day scanning treetops for red squirrels, suddenly they are everywhere, standing on their hind legs, hopping up to the cottage door. Don Clegg is a retired woodwork teacher with a hint of red about his beard. There have been squirrels coming down from the forest here for 20 years. At the moment they have about seven that arrive for monkey nuts every morning and in the afternoons. Over the years the numbers have dropped, but now they are coming back again. </p> <p>Clegg is all for Redesdale's campaign. They had Bill Oddie up here but, like the squirrels, like the SOS group, like the Wildlife Trust, he sat on the fence, wouldn't say that killing greys was the answer. To Clegg it's a no-brainer. What does he think makes the reds so special? </p> <p>'It's simple really,' he says, 'it's just like they belong here.'</p> <p>That evening over supper, Redesdale tells some tales of his Mitford aunts in their natural habitats. His relations with them were distant but formative. Jessica told him not to be so stupid when he boldly announced he wanted to be an army chaplain at the age of 16; Debo, Duchess of Devonshire, recently invited them all to tea at Chatsworth and they fretted about taking their son who was in the middle of potty training; Redesdale's father was absolutely scared stiff of Nancy. All the time he talks, though, the conversation comes back to squirrels. I wonder if he has ever eaten any. Somewhat sheepishly, he admits he hasn't. It seems to me the next day might be a good moment to start.</p> <p>We meet Parker in the morning behind enemy lines near the Angel of the North. On this side of the Tyne there are still plenty of greys and he has put some traps down here to assess the reserve strength of the population. He has his daughter Bronwyn with him in the van. 'She loves to tell her friends at school what she gets up to with her dad and the squirrels,' Parker says proudly. 'I don't,' says Bronwyn flatly.</p> <p>We walk up a hillside in the woods, checking traps. Two contain squirrels, both juvenile males apparently, anxiously checking the mesh for an exit. Parker takes them back to the van.</p> <p>'I shoot them in the back of the head,' he says. 'You have to shoot them just behind the ear. If you hit them in the middle of the skull you can miss the brain.'</p> <p>He lets them into the killing trap and trains an air gun through the mesh. The car door is open and a Queen CD is playing. As the squirrels find their way over to the gun barrel, 'Don't Stop Me Now' is booming. As squirrels number 19,547 and 19,548 are dispatched, thick blood seeping from their wounds, 'Another One Bites the Dust' might seem more appropriate.</p> <p>Parker puts the carcasses in the back of his van. He's had a call from Mrs Sanderson, who has caught another squirrel in her trap this morning, and we are to meet Lord Redesdale at her house. 'We are like the fourth emergency service,' he says.</p> <p>Along the way, Parker discusses the possibilities for a new kill trap that will dispense with the need for shooting. It's like a huge mouse trap, he says, but they have had a few near misses with fingers in setting it up, so it's not quite right yet. </p> <p>I wonder if he has a sense that the squirrels know they are being hunted now?</p> <p>'When it gets down to the last few in a wood, I'd say definitely,' Parker suggests. 'When they are on the back foot they all know about it. Then it's a question of getting into their minds, under their skins.'</p> <p>At the back of Mrs Sanderson's house another squirrel, out-thought, is awaiting its fate. Redesdale is already there and Parker suggests that he takes the shot.</p> <p>'If I must,' he says. He stands over the cage and shoots the squirrel, with some aplomb, from the hip. Blood stains Mrs Sanderson's patio, but she's impressed.</p> <p>'My, you are a good shot,' she says of Redesdale's marksmanship from two inches.</p> <p>'Well, he's a lord, he has to be,' Parker observes.</p> <p>We all stare down at the squirrel, just now a livewire. 'When you start you get very nervous. But after a while you get to know how to relax into it,' Redesdale says. </p> <p>The first 17,000 are the worst, I suppose.</p> <p>The peer is confident there was no suffering. 'It was a bit bothered, but it wasn't too bothered, and then it was dead.'</p> <p>It is decided with something just short of enthusiasm that we will have the squirrels for tea. For a year now the RSPP has been supplying Ridley's Fish and Game of Corbridge with dead squirrels, and a market has developed for the meat. Parker gets 75p a squirrel and David Ridley, who runs the business, sells them oven ready at \u00a32.25 wholesale, \u00a33.25 over the counter. There has been a good deal of mail-order interest, mainly from restaurants and individuals in London. Over the summer demand has far outstripped supply.</p> <p>The only problem, Ridley suggests when we get there, is that unlike rabbits, squirrels take a long time to skin. One of his skinners has it down to a fine art. He blowtorches them first to get rid of the fleas and then gets to work on the fur. Even so it still takes three minutes per animal. </p> <p>That skinner is not around today so Parker does the squirrels himself on a bench alongside a deadpan pigeon plucker. While Parker tears at the squirrels' stubborn skins, David Ridley discusses ways of cooking squirrels. 'They have no fat on them and they live mostly on berries and nuts so the flesh is sweet. I've roasted them. I've flash-fried them with fresh thyme.' One restaurant has done well with a confit of grey squirrel served with pine nuts; Ridley and Redesdale have been discussing the possibility of the canap\u00e9 market. And yes, each squirrel they sell does indeed have to carry the label 'May contain nuts'.</p> <p>Back at Redesdale's cottage, we present him with the flayed rodents, now under cellophane. He looks at them with forced cheer.</p> <p>There must be times when he regrets becoming the squirrels' champion. </p> <p>'It's like everything,' he suggests, smiling. 'It seemed like a good idea at the time.' </p> <p>Is that how Helen, his wife, feels about it, I wonder. Over the past couple of days she has offered an affectionately ironic chorus to her husband's obsession. </p> <p>'There is,' she says diplomatically, 'no doubt they are doing brilliantly for the reds, but it can take over rather.'</p> <p>'I'll cook 'em!' Redesdale suggests brightly, before displaying a rather worrying unfamiliarity with the hob controls.</p> <p>Eventually the squirrel sizzles dutifully in the pan. Small tufts of fur still cling to its flanks. Redesdale pokes at it with a spatula and laughs a little nervously. </p> <p>'What is it?' asks his elder daughter.</p> <p>'It's squiwwel!' her sister confirms.</p> <p>'Perhaps I should have quartered it,' Redesdale says. The skinned squirrel lies spatchcocked on its back, paws upwards.</p> <p>Paul Parker is due but there is no sign of him; Bronwyn, who has joined us for supper, suggests he is feeling a little tired. Or maybe he's sampled Redesdale's cooking before.</p> <p>At the stove, Redesdale discusses other media opportunities. 'We have been approached to do a TV series,' he confesses. 'BBC3 I think.'</p> <p>It might, I suggest, make a nice antidote to Springwatch - Northumberland Slaughter</p> <p>'Isn't BBC3 the comedy channel?' Lady Redesdale wonders, drily.</p> <p>Redesdale serves up the squirrel. He cuts a piece off and tucks in with some bravado, offering a commentary while chewing. 'This is the saddle. It's not bad, there's no fat on it.' In a reluctant John Selwyn Gummer moment he feeds a little to his children, and gives a sizeable pink-looking haunch to me. We all chew ruminatively on the slightly raw squirrel and think for a moment. 'It tastes like chicken,' we agree. </p> <p>'Very good chicken,' Redesdale suggests, optimistically. Not for the first time, his wife raises an eyebrow. </p> <p>On the draining board two more skinned rodents are waiting to be cooked. The more he eats, though, the more Redesdale brightens. 'This is rather wonderful,' he declares. 'We can now officially eat them into extinction!' He returns to the flesh and bones on his plate with the look of a man who has woken with the solution to a problem that had troubled him the night before.</p> <p>'One down,' I say, swallowing a gamey mouthful, 'and only 2m to go.'</p>",
  "<p>A pink sunrise over Green Bay. As the breath stands out in the freezing cold of an autumn Wisconsin morning, the roads around Lambeau Field are already stirring. It is game day for the Green Bay Packers - the American football team formed on a local street corner in 1919 and owned by their fans - and the Atlanta Falcons are in town.</p> <p>Gazebos, grills, hammocks, makeshift bars, tables and deckchairs have been left in preparation outside homes overnight. And when Lambeau Field's vast car park is opened four hours before the midday kick-off, the tailgate parties begin, as they do in every other available space around the stadium. </p> <p>On the back of cars, station wagons, pick-ups and vans, thousands of soon-to-be-very-drunk Cheeseheads, as Packers fans are known, many wearing hats shaped like a triangular cheddar slice, hang posters and pennants, and position armchairs and sofas. Music blares, barbecues are fired, bratwurst and steaks dipped in marinade, whisky, wine, vodka and endless crates of beer appear. A very merry time begins.</p> <p>'Look at my tattoos,' says a man who calls himself Santa. He is an enthusiastic 51-year-old with a long grey beard and flowing hair and must weigh around 20st. He is tailgating with friends behind an ambulance, which is parked next to a van that has two gigantic pink flamingos on the roof. Draped over the ambulance are bras - red, green, yellow, orange, blue, black, brown, and some that need cleaning.</p> <p>'There's Rudolph the Reindeer, this one's a little girl whispering into Father Christmas's ear,' Santa says pulling up his Packers shirt to show his tattoos. 'It's my job, every year I give out presents. I start 31 October. You want a beer? Soon I'll get the grey drained from my beard. It takes three goes for that. Then the hairdresser uses white toner to make it like Santa Claus. Every week it costs $175 (\u00a3100) for a retouch.' </p> <p>All of Green Bay, a tiny city of around 100,000 people on the shores of Lake Michigan, seems to have congregated here, as it does on each of the eight regular-season home games of the NFL season. Since 1960, every game at the stadium named after founder and first head coach, Earl 'Curly' Lambeau, has been a sell-out. There are 80,000 people on the season-ticket waiting-list and, with 30 or 40 becoming available each year, tailgating is how many Cheeseheads get closest to their beloved team. In a state with the second lowest beer-tax - six cents - and ranked America's worst for alcohol abuse, this means a lot of drinking. </p> <p>Santa's friend Dave will not reveal his surname 'in case my wife finds out'. He is wearing a sticker that says The Optimistic Gent, is drinking beer and is the ambulance owner. </p> <p>'We just got more,' roars a tipsy Santa pointing to a star-spangled bra. Bleary eyed, Dave explains. 'In 2000 when they began redoing the stadium we did a campaign, \"Support the Legend.\" And we kept on. Bras give support, right?' he says, not quite sure the joke is understood. </p> <p>Dave produces a collection of photographs - there are hundreds - that feature the owners of the bras swaying free in the cold Wisconsin wind. In place to protect the modesty of the topless women - who range in age - are Packers stickers shaped like Playboy bunnies. </p> <p>'It's freezing, there isn't much else to do in Wisconsin,' Dave says. 'So you drink and follow the Packers.' Which is what occurs until noon and beyond for a game the Packers will lose 27-24. Some Cheeseheads go into Lambeau Field, some pile into tents in the so-called Tundra Zone to watch on TV. Some just keep on drinking. </p> <p>The Packers' status as the only community-owned professional team in America has been in place since five local businessmen - known as the Hungry Five - formed the Green Bay Football Corporation to rescue the team in 1921. This makes the Packers unique, an anomaly, and Cheeseheads are fanatical followers. 'I came alone and it cost me around $2,500,' says Michael, a nurse from Denmark. 'My wife's not too pleased, but what can you do?' </p> <p>The term Cheesehead was appropriated from fans in detested rival city Chicago, who taunted them about Wisconsin being America's dairy capital. In 1987 Ralph Bruno made the first cheddar hat and wore it to a baseball game between the Chicago White Sox and the Milwaukee Brewers, the team from down the road, and an official name for one of the most loyal tribes in sport was born. In Britain only Newcastle are, perhaps, comparable. Except the Packers are a slickly run organisation. And boasting a record 12 NFL championships, the team of Lambeau, legendary coach Vince Lombardi, on-field generals Bart Starr and Brett Favre, also know how to win - fans call their very modest home city Titletown, USA and are not laughed at. </p> <p>Then there are the Packers' 112,015 shareholders. Many are third or fourth generation, with no thought of selling. 'I bought them for my mom and when she died I had them framed,' says Tom Parker, a fan who has hired the 'same driveway we got last year to tailgate with 20 friends' on a nearby street. </p> <p>'It's a fairy tale type story,' says Starr, their great quarterback who was MVP in the Packers' Super Bowl wins in 1967 and 1968. 'How it occurred is amazing. Now it may be small, but in those days Green Bay was tiny.' </p> <p>The team was formed in 1919 by Lambeau and George Calhoun, the sports editor of the Green Bay Press-Gazette following a chance conversation on the street. Calhoun had followed Lambeau's football career as a high-school full-back and at Notre Dame University. During Christmas 1918 Lambeau caught tonsillitis and after six bedridden weeks decided to stay in Green Bay for the winter rather than return to college. Wanting to continue playing, Lambeau squeezed $500 from the Indian Packing Company, a local meat-packing business, for whom he worked as a clerk. </p> <p>Calhoun, meanwhile, advertised in the Gazette for players. Two years after forming, the Packers joined the American Professional Football Association, forerunner of the NFL, and in 1929 they won the first of their 12 championships. </p> <p>Calhoun, who also liked a beer - one tale tells of him quickly downing 18 from a 24-tin crate - served as the Packers' media man until 1947, publishing a weekly press release called the Dope Sheet, which was revived two years ago. Lambeau retired from playing in 1929, aged 32, but continued coaching the Packers for another 20 years and was one of the initial inductees into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Lambeau was finally forced out in a power struggle in 1949. </p> <p>In 1923, 1935, 1950 and 1997, the Packers issued shares. 'Other NFL teams have one owner, we have the community,' says Packers president Mark Murphy. 'Forty-five directors are voted in and approved by the shareholders. An executive of seven run the business.' </p> <p>After Lambeau left the Packers, having won six NFL titles, that business became a decade of losing until Lombardi's arrival in 1959. 'I was drafted in 1956. We had a losing season that year, in '57 and '58. He immediately turned it around,' says Starr of a genius who became a head coach at the relatively late age of 45, yet would have the Super Bowl trophy named after him. </p> <p>When Lombardi retired in 1968 he had masterminded victory in Super Bowls I and II. The second was reached in an amazing game against the Dallas Cowboys on New Year's Eve 1967. </p> <p>Known as the Ice Bowl, it also gave Lambeau Field its Frozen Tundra nickname. 'You don't want to know how cold,' Starr says. 'Bitter. Unbelievably.' The official temperature, with wind chill, was a staggering -36F. Unsurprisingly, the undersoil heating failed. With Dallas leading 17-14, Starr, who says he still suffers frostbite, had driven the Packers from their 32-yard line to within inches of the Cowboys end zone when he called a time-out with 16 seconds left. </p> <p>Starr takes up the story. 'I ran to the sidelines and said to coach, \"There's nothing wrong with the running play. The problem is the backs are slipping. I'm upright so I can shuffle and lunge behind them.\" So help me God. At a crucial, cold time like this, all Vince Lombardi said was, \"Then run it and let's get the hell out of here.\" I was chuckling running back to the line.' </p> <p>Starr scored with the play to win the game. Victory over the Oakland Raiders in Super Bowl II followed. But it would be 29 years until Favre inspired a third Packers' win of the Lombardi Trophy, renamed following the coach's premature death, aged 57, in 1970. When Favre's victorious team returned home, 200,000 Cheeseheads awaited. </p> <p>How much, then, of the future depends on that support? 'Many people own shares, but it's symbolic,' says Scott Schwartz, whose 'Game Day' book is signed by Cheeseheads from all over the world. 'We don't have much of a say.' </p> <p>A Packers source explains. 'The stock is basically a donation. The most recent sale in 1997 made around $100m - each share was $200 - and older ones were made worth 1,000 of the new issue, so a few whose families or businesses bought stock in the first sale have most voting power.' </p> <p>Yet other fans seem more than happy with their contribution. And while a further scheme would again rely on the goodwill of a local community where the average salary is $33,000, the Packers have invested elsewhere. </p> <p>There is a 30-year waiting list for the 166 luxury boxes installed during the 2003 face-lift. That also raised capacity to 72,928, while doing an admirable job of retaining the stadium's original 1950s style. Land around Lambeau Field has also been bought to develop. </p> <p>Next Sunday at Wembley, the New Orleans Saints 'host' the San Diego Chargers. This follows last year's first regular-season game played there, in which the New York Giants beat the Miami Dolphins. The NFL have begun a programme where each team will give up a home game in order to expand the sport worldwide and Packers officials are in full support, but it is clear the fans are not keen. 'We would not like it - to Europe, to Madison in Wisconsin, anywhere,' says lifelong Cheesehead Marty Hendricks. 'People build their fall weekend around games and tailgating with friends and family. And I don't think most fans care too much about the NFL going global.'</p> <p>\u2022 Sky Sports is broadcasting more than 125 live NFL games this season via its interactive coverage on Sky digital</p> <h2>Take your medicine: rugby doctors set the standard</h2> <p>So, American football fans think they are party animals? In which case, they really should hop across the Pond and take a look at English rugby union supporters if they want to see true professionals at work.</p> <p>Take Twickenham, where bountiful quantities of the finest wines, spirits and beers are sunk with unfathomable zeal in the West car park. Mind you, the patrons who frequent the most famous car park in sport would not be so vulgar as to use the word 'tailgating'.</p> <p>But it's not just the West car park that resembles a lake of alcohol on Twickenham match days. Wander around the bars or the nearby pubs, and you will see pint upon pint being downed more quickly than it takes Usain Bolt to run 100m. That said, Bolt probably does a better rendition of 'American Pie' and 'Sloop John B' than most England supporters.</p> <p>Then there is the annual Army v Royal Navy match at Twickenham, which regularly attracts more than 40,000 spectators, some of whom can barely put one foot in front of the other - and that's before they even arrive at the ground. Perhaps not surprising, given that they will have been availing themselves of copious amounts of the hard stuff since leaving their military bases in the early morning.</p> <p>But there is simply nothing to match the final of the United Hospitals Challenge Cup, the world's oldest rugby tournament, which takes place at Old Deer Park, the home of London Welsh, in early spring. Flour bombs and egg-throwing are not quite as prevalent as they once were, but some of the imbibing among the on-looking medical students knocks Twickenham's finest wreckers into a cocked hat.</p> <p>It is a sight to behold as some of the country's most eminent surgeons-in-waiting - a number of them swigging voraciously from rapidly emptying bottles of whisky, brandy and port - stagger around so helplessly, they are quite possibly unaware that a game of rugby is actually taking place. Now, those are party animals.</p> <p>'It is a bit tamer than it used to be,' says Terry Gibson, the president of the United Hospitals RFC. 'But there is still a party atmosphere, with a lot of jocular ragging and people enjoying themselves in the bar.' No kidding. <strong>Christopher Lyles</strong></p>",
  "<p>Peter Morgan's <strong>Frost/Nixon </strong>began its award-laden life on the Donmar Warehouse stage in 2006 and, now pretty much intact as a movie, opened the 2008 London Film Festival with all the pomp and fanfare befitting a heavyweight Oscar contender.</p> <p>Although the film is directed by Ron Howard, it is Morgan, the screenwriter behind The Queen, The Last King of Scotland and Stephen Frears's television drama The Deal ('Blair/Brown', perhaps?) who is the unifying force here, as well as the piece's two original stars, Welshman Michael Sheen and Italian American Frank Langella. Actors using Morgan's words have done well of late - Helen Mirren winning everything for The Queen, and Forest Whitaker triumphing similarly for his Idi Amin. Similar accolades surely await Langella's Nixon, a performance which has already won a Tony. </p> <p>This film version recaptures the intimacy of theatre and is a perfect example of Morgan's art, taking the viewer into the mental workings of powerful men, their decisions and revisions, their pain and perspiration as they wrestle with conscience, duty, ambition and ego. His Elizabeth Windsor, Amin and Nixon have a Shakespearean grandeur - like Cleopatra, Lear or Coriolanus -, providing complex parts for screen actors, just as playing Blair and Frost has seen Sheen's star soar - his next work on a Morgan script will reveal the tortured ego of Brian Clough, the biggest 'ead ever, in The Damned United</p> <p>Back to this film, which you can't see until January but to which the opening night audience thrilled. The action, set in 1977, centres on David Frost's overweening pride in securing the first TV interviews with the post-Watergate pariah that was Richard Nixon.</p> <p>Displaying considerably more elan than in his adaptation of The Da Vinci Code, Howard orchestrates this battle of testosterone like a boxing match - in Nixon's corner is the rigidly loyal Kevin Bacon; tending to Frost is Matthew Macfadyen (playing John Birt, before he became the cut man at the BBC), aided by Oliver Platt and an excellent Sam Rockwell. Tension is immaculately built through the revelatory power of television's close-up, and there's an undeniable, journalistic thrill in watching a president being held to account, especially with its relevance to the current political climate. Superb, sweaty stuff.</p> <p>Spike Lee's <strong>Miracle at St Anna </strong>was rather good, too, despite its two and three-quarter hours. I once sat through a Venice festival screening of all four and a half hours of his amazing New Orleans doc, When the Levees Broke, with barely a hint of fatigue setting in, and this feature is just as energetic, fascinating, wild and surprising. Lee, working with cinematographer Matty Libatique, creates a collage of references sampling war films (from Saving Private Ryan to The Dirty Dozen), Italian neo-realism and courtroom drama. The film, based on James McBride's book, has a wonderfully dramatic start that sends us spinning back to war-torn Italy in 1944 and a troop of black Buffalo Soldiers (including Derek Luke, Omar Benson Miller, Michael Ealy) hiding in a Tuscan village, miraculously holding off Germans. It's uneven, but this is passionate, often brilliant work and a fresh addition to the American war movie canon. </p> <p>Two British films debuted in the opening days. <strong>Franklyn </strong>is an ambitious and original romance, starring Ryan Phillippe, Sam Riley and Eva Green. The first feature from Gerald McMorrow, it mixes gothic futurism with a modern urban love story.

  "<p>When a politician claims that he always saw the storm on the horizon, it is often more informative to read what he was saying when the sun was still shining. Before I listened to the latest thoughts from Gordon Brown and David Cameron on the crisis of capitalism, I first reminded myself what they were saying before the boom went bust. </p> <p>Let's start with Gordon Brown in June 2005 giving the Chancellor's annual speech to the City at the Mansion House. Addressing the bow-tied ranks of money-changers, he paid lavish homage to 'your unique innovative skills, your courage and steadfastness'. They had his personal thanks 'for the outstanding, the invaluable contribution you make to the prosperity of Britain'. Though even the financiers may have wondered what courage had to do with it, they clapped long and hard. </p> <p>Having hosed them with adulation every time he visited the City, Gordon Brown surpassed himself when he returned in 2007 to deliver his final Mansion House speech as Chancellor before he moved into Number 10. 'A new world order has been created,' he proclaimed. Britain was 'a new world leader' thanks to 'your efforts, ingenuity and creativity'. He congratulated himself for 'resisting pressure' to toughen up regulation of their activities. Everyone needed to follow the City's 'great example', emulate this 'high value-added, talent-driven industry'. 'Britain needs more of the vigour, ingenuity and aspiration that you already demonstrate.' Thanks to their 'remarkable achievements', we had the huge privilege to live in 'an era that history will record as the beginning of a new Golden Age'.</p> <p>Or, as it turns out, an era that history will record as ending in the Great Crash of 2008. Their 'ingenuity' engineered the most seismic financial crisis in 80 years. Their 'aspiration' has destroyed swaths of their own industry and the rest of the economy. Their 'vigour' is propelling us into recession. What he then hailed as a 'Golden Age', the Prime Minister now deplores as an 'Age of Irresponsibility'.</p> <p>David Cameron has had some fun at the expense of the Prime Minister. Which might make you assume that the Tory leader had foreseen, as Gordon Brown had not, that it would all turn to dust. So here is Mr Cameron in June 2006, offering his thoughts on 'the new global economy'. He trumpeted 'the victory of capitalism, privatisation and liberalisation'. Not to be out-grovelled by Gordon Brown when talking about bankers, the Tory leader lauded the 'highly innovative' City as 'the biggest international finance centre in the world'. Mr Cameron happily noted that 'there are more than 550 international banks and 170 global securities houses in London', numbers that may now be subject to downward revision. The Cameron of this pre-bust vintage gave the credit for all that reckless - sorry, 'innovative' - trading to 'critical Conservative decisions' when the Tories were in government. It proved that 'light regulation' and 'low regulation' were 'keys to success'. </p> <p>Just over a year ago, in September 2007, Mr Cameron made a speech at the London School Of Economics. The financial markets were already experiencing what was then politely termed 'turbulence', but the Tory leader chose to amplify his thesis about the ascendancy of unconstrained capitalism. In a section entitled 'The End Of Economic History?', he answered the question by declaring that: 'The debate is now settled.' 'Liberalism' had prevailed. The left's silly idea that markets required tight regulation had been thoroughly discredited. 'The result? The world economy more stable than for a generation.' He drizzled sycophancy on the heads of the bankers, drooling that 'our hugely sophisticated financial markets match funds with ideas better than ever before'. What a pity the casino got so sophisticated that it traded trillions of dollars of toxic bets that no one understood, including the gamblers themselves. </p> <p>I could fill every column until Christmas with the foolish eulogising of the animal spirits of ungoverned markets by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. I could probably fill this entire newspaper with embarrassing quotes from senior politicians about the erstwhile masters of the universe. A generation of leaders, here and in much of the rest of the world, fell under the thrall of high finance. The commanding heights of politics were surrendered to the bankers. Right-leaning politicians did so from ideological conviction, left-leaning politicians did so because they came to believe that it was the only way to power. The markets were allowed to set the rules for the politicians. Leaders couldn't tax wealth more than the markets were prepared to allow. They couldn't spend, borrow, intervene or regulate without the permission of the gods of the dealing rooms. When Bill Clinton was in the White House, he would rage about the way in which his presidency was dictated to by 'a bunch of fucking bond traders'. One of his senior aides, James Carville, joked: 'I used to think if there was reincarnation, I wanted to come back as the President or the Pope or a .400 baseball hitter. But now I want to come back as the bond market. You can intimidate everybody.' </p> <p>This side of the Atlantic, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown took a short spoon to supper with the devil. He seemed such a seductive fellow when the financial sector was growing four times as fast as the rest of the economy. The credit boom kept house prices rising, shop tills ringing, tax revenues flowing, the country feeling prosperous and voting Labour. The financial alchemists of the City appeared to have invented a perpetual motion machine for producing cheap money. No one in government wanted to ask awkward questions about ballooning debt and obscene bonuses that incentivised ever more reckless bets. Mr Brown made his wildly hubristic claim to have abolished 'boom and bust'. In so much as the Tories raised an objection, it was that Labour was over-constraining the 'wealth creators' with bureaucratic red tape. </p> <p>Vince Cable was alone when he wandered the battlements of the City of Gold crying his warning that it would all end in tears. That the Lib Dem has been proved utterly correct doesn't seem to be doing his party much good in the polls, but at least it has made him Britain's most popular politician. </p> <p>Gordon Brown and David Cameron are meanwhile scrambling to reposition themselves for the world of the bust. The Prime Minister would prefer we forgot that drivel about a 'Golden Age' and look out those of his old speeches in which he argued for a global surveillance system of financial markets. Mr Cameron would be obliged if we'd pretend we hadn't heard him extolling the gamblers and concentrate on his more recent call for 'economic responsibility'. </p> <p>The Prime Minister's strategy is to try to internationalise not just the solutions to this crisis, but also the culpability for it. He would have us blame those greedy bankers who were once his heroes and the America that he once so admired. Mr Cameron is conversely keen to localise the blame around the Prime Minister. The Tory party has been uncomfortable supporting the government and unnerved by the sight of Gordon Brown feted as some sort of superhero. The Tory leader has been reassuring worried colleagues: 'I will pin the tail on the donkey.' Hence his speech on Friday which broke the pseudo truce by heaping culpability on the Prime Minister. </p> <p>This parochial blame game takes place in the context of a much more important global realignment of the balance of power between finance, government and the rest of society. The barons of capital have been devoured by their own excesses. Forced to go running to the state for help, large chunks of their firms now owned by the taxpayers they previously treated with contempt, the bankers are now the supplicants to the politicians. Humiliation has been visited not just on the individual chief executives and chairmen who have lost their jobs; an entire class has been discredited in voters' eyes. High finance will not vanish, but its numbers, glamour and power will shrink. Charles Leadbetter, always an insightful analyst, draws a useful comparison with what happened to the trades union leaders. Those barons grew over-mighty in the Sixties and Seventies until they met their nemesis in the shape of Margaret Thatcher. They are still with us, but they lost their ability to mesmerise politicians and intimidate everyone else. High finance has similarly been dethroned. </p> <p>There is no appetite, beyond the denuded ranks of revolutionary socialists, for a command economy anything like the model so discredited by the experiment with the Soviet Union. Governments have taken over banks out of necessity not ideological conviction. But there has been a shift. The intellectual and political climate now favours those sceptical about the more exaggerated claims made for markets. George Bush has been forced to nationalise banks. It looks increasingly likely that he will be succeeded by Barack Obama governing with the help of big Democrat majorities in Congress. David Cameron, who as recently as his party conference was inviting us to regard him as the son of Thatcher, is now denouncing 'irresponsible capitalism'. Gordon Brown has rediscovered a purpose for his premiership and a potential legacy in the reform and regulation of global finance. </p> <p>The full extent and shape of this power shift will take time to become clear. This much is already certain. Political leaders will not fawn before money as they once did. The era of uncritical awe for financiers is over. The epoch of blind faith in the market is done with. When our leaders go to the City in future, they will no longer take knee pads with them.</p>",
  "<p>The 2008 US presidential election is perhaps unique in having transformed global politics before the result is even known, for two reasons.</p> <p>First, there is the simple fact of Barack Obama's candidacy. There is no doubt that Mr Obama's campaign has been damaged by racist agitation - some discreet, some more overt. There are sections of American society that will clearly never be reconciled to the idea of a black President. But no Western European country has come so close to installing a non-white citizen to its highest office of state.</p> <p>Second, the eruption of a massive economic crisis in the middle of the campaign - and the candidates' different responses - has revived an argument about the nature and moral purpose of capitalism not seen for more than a generation. However different the British and American political systems and cultures may be, we can be sure those arguments will soon cross the Atlantic.</p> <p>It is Mr Obama who has responded to the global financial crisis with greater agility and confidence, and earned a substantial poll lead as a result. He backed the Republican-devised banking bail-out, while tailoring his own message to address voters' resentment at an incumbent administration that has been a loyal friend to the very rich. Roughly speaking, Mr Obama intends to raise taxes for relatively wealthy Americans, cut them for the middle classes and temporarily suspend them for businesses that create jobs.</p> <p>John McCain, by contrast, offered shrill, populist attacks on Wall Street's 'casino capitalism' without acknowledging that his own party built the casino. He favours corporate tax cuts and has accused Mr Obama of planning a 'redistribution of massive amounts of wealth' that amounts to 'socialism'.</p> <p>Both candidates have made spending promises that they would struggle to honour in office. Government revenues will shrink in a recession and a huge tranche of national wealth has just been diverted to shore up the financial system. To borrow David Cameron's favourite image of fiscal austerity, the cupboard is bare.</p> <p>Restocking that cupboard - or rather, finding a way to plug the gaping hole in public finances without putting yet more burdens on taxpayers or ramping up unsustainable levels of national debt - is one of the biggest policy challenges on both sides of the Atlantic.</p> <p>Mr Cameron is lucky that he can get away with simply describing the problem with a nifty metaphor. There is unlikely to be an election before 2010. While Gordon Brown's sure-footed handling of the immediate crisis has created a modest recovery in Labour's poll ratings, that temporary advantage could easily be eliminated in a long, ugly recession. </p> <p>The Tories are counting on the fact that Labour's long incumbency will do to Gordon Brown in 2010 what the Republicans' stewardship of the economy is doing to John McCain. Mr Cameron wants to be the candidate of change and renewal. Despite his party's traditional preference for Republican Presidents, the Tory leader would gladly see Barack Obama installed in the White House. That would at least demonstrate that inexperience is no bar to electoral success.</p> <p>But the awkward fact for Mr Cameron is that his handling of the financial crisis so far has more of the John McCain about it than the Barack Obama. The Conservatives, like the Republicans, are so steeped in pro-business, pro-market ideology that they struggle to find a coherent language to express solidarity with ordinary people who are both anxious about their own finances and outraged by government indulgence of the super-rich.</p> <p>The extraordinary rhetorical U-turns spun from pure political expediency that David Cameron and George Osborne have recently performed, attacking irresponsible bankers and exorbitant bonuses, sound like empty populism.</p> <p>Gordon Brown can reasonably be accused of hypocrisy in suddenly turning on the bankers whom he once assiduously courted. But he can also mobilise a language of social equality and fairness that is embedded in the political tradition from which he hails. He could feasibly now start looking at ways to mitigate the effects of a serious recession by transferring some wealth from the super-rich to the poor.</p> <p>Indeed, if Obama wins, and that is the course he takes, even the Tories could start talking about redistribution. That would really signal historic change.</p>",
  "<p>Five months into the job, Boris Johnson has already made his mark as Mayor of London by getting rid of the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir Ian Blair. It is about time people started addressing him as Mr Mayor - he has earned it. But apparently nobody does - the young, eager-beaver staff at City Hall call him Boris, just as they called Ken Livingstone Ken. For such an incredibly important job, the mayoralty carries few if any trappings of power - no official car (Boris cycles to work), no official residence, no chain of office, no mayor's banquet, hardly even an expense account.</p> <p>Boris of course is 'running late', so I chat to a nice young press officer about how City Hall has changed since Livingstone's day. 'It's more open,' he says. Apparently it used to be divided into cubicles, but one of Boris's first acts was to have all the partitions knocked down to make it open plan. His own office is still separate but, according to the press officer, Boris is very approachable. 'More so than Ken?' 'Probably, yes.'</p> <p>Boris eventually emerges only 10 minutes late and greets me as an old friend, though I haven't seen him since I interviewed him five years ago. I was hopelessly charmed by him on that occasion - and then subsequently uncharmed when I read of his affair with Petronella Wyatt. This time, almost the first thing I see on entering his office is a copy of Woodrow (father of Petronella) Wyatt's Journals lying on the coffee table. Does Boris have some death-wish desire to remind me of the scandal? </p> <p>The second thing I see is a man who looks exactly like Charles Moore, Boris's former editor at the Telegraph and predecessor at the Spectator, whom Boris introduces as his director of communications. Poor Charles Moore, I think, how embarrassing to work for a man who used to work for you. It is only when he speaks with a Welsh accent that I recognise him as Guto Hari, formerly of the BBC.</p> <p>Meanwhile Boris is flinging open cupboards and showing me the famous wine collection he inherited from Livingstone's day. 'It took me about a month to find it because I didn't open any of the cupboards.' It looks very enticing, but Boris says it's too early to crack open. He is drinking again, though? (He gave up alcohol for the whole mayoral campaign.) 'Oh God, yes. I did find it one of the most tedious things I've ever done. The only thing was it did help me lose weight a bit, but I soon made it up again with eating. I think giving up alcohol is cruel, cruel, one of the cruellest and most deceitful things you can do to your body. I've taken more out of alcohol than alcohol has taken out of me. It's a great gift of the gods, in my view.'</p> <p>Then it's over to the window to admire the view. 'Best view in London,' he says, 'absolutely fabulous, but you can't see it because you can't clean the windows. Well, you can, but it costs thousands of pounds, you have to get a cherrypicker. If you want to blame Norman Foster [who designed the building], do.' It is true that the windows are absolutely filthy - nevertheless it is still a great view, looking over Tower Bridge and the Tower of London.</p> <p>Boris is still whirling about in a flurry of displacement activity, but eventually Guto Hari and I, acting as a pair of sheepdogs, herd him to the table. I tell him that when I interviewed him five years ago he was trying to have his cake and eat it, to be an MP and edit the Spectator at the same time. 'Well, I still am! Let's not beat around the bush here. My policy on cake is still pro having it and pro eating it!' But actually, although he still writes a weekly column for the Telegraph, he now seems to have committed himself wholeheartedly to politics.</p> <p>He is, he says, thrilled to be mayor. 'It's the most wonderful job in British politics. Every day I wake up in a state of wonderment that I have been elected - obviously knowing that millions of other people wake up in a state of wonderment that I have been elected too! It is just brilliant fun, but also very hard. I realised that if you're going to make a difference you've got to work really flat out.' He works at least 12 hours a day, and says he has never worked harder in his life except for one period at Eton. 'When I was about 16 I worked ferociously hard for two terms and laid the foundations for all future activity - I thereafter never really did any academic work. But it's a bit like that now - I'm having to run pretty fast on my hamster wheel.' (Note the intellectual arrogance - two terms' work was enough to get him through A-levels and Oxford. According to his Oxford tutor, if he had done just a bit of work, he could easily have got a first. It didn't matter though - everyone accepts that he is brilliant.)</p> <p>Many of his friends, he says, were surprised he even wanted to be Mayor of London. He had a comfortable seat as MP for Henley; he was earning reportedly \u00a3250,000 from the Telegraph as well as extras like \u00a325,000 a show for Have I Got News For You. But his friends obviously underestimated his ambition. Has he lost any friends as a result?</p> <p>'Yeah. It's true that there's a whole lot of people I might have hung out with or had lunch with that I haven't seen much of for the past five months and I do feel bad about that.' He thought he would miss the House of Commons but he doesn't at all. 'That's the most amazing thing about coming here, that not for one second have I thought, \"Golly, I wish I was on my hind feet in the House of Commons\" - no way! Better to reign in heaven than serve in hell or whatever the quote is.' ('Better to reign in hell than serve in heaven', actually - Satan in Paradise Lost</p> <p>The first time he ever thought of being mayor was in about 1995 when he'd just come back from Brussels, where he was the Telegraph's EU correspondent, 'and I remember hearing someone on telly talking about having a Mayor of London and I thought \"Wow, that would be a wonderful job!\" And then, like so many things, it faded into the background. And then when Ken Livingstone was elected, like many people my age I was a bit of a Livingstone fan in those days. Obviously I particularly enjoyed it when he was sticking it so firmly up the Labour Party - I thought that was great.' </p> <p>But about three years ago someone in the Tory party suggested he might stand as mayor, and 'my natural vanity and competitive spirit was piqued, but again I just filed it away as something I might do one day. But then I got increasingly interested in doing it, and finally decided to go for it. But I don't think you could say the Tory party was beating a path to my door! They were trying all sorts of other people - Greg Dyke, Brian Paddick - I was by no means their first choice. But having exhausted all other options, they then decided that they would put their shirt on me.'</p> <p>At the time, I told him, I thought he was a sort of joke candidate.</p> <p>'Did you really? That's both fascinating and insulting! But that was my own feeling of insecurity, because it was quite a thing to go up against Ken. In a way it was like Apocalypse Now - there was this deeply revered fellow, the Marlon Brando character who'd been a colonel and done incredible things at a fantastically young age, but then he'd gone up river and holed up in his lair and allowed things to go to his head. So I felt like Captain Willard, sailing up the long river. But I approached him with that sort of feeling of reverence, at the sad obligation of having to dispatch him.' </p> <p>But he is still on surprisingly good terms with Livingstone and having dinner with him soon. Livingstone sometimes turns up at Mayor's Question Time, which Boris says is actually quite helpful, 'because this office has no constitutional opposition, so it's an important discipline to have someone who can say, \"Well, I would do it this way.\" And Ken is public-spirited enough to want to do that. He does genuinely love London.'</p> <p>Boris has definitely changed since his Spectator days. (Incidentally, he told me that, though he loved the Spectator, he thinks in retrospect he stayed there a year too long.) He said during the mayoral campaign that, in order for Londoners to take him seriously, he would have to learn to take himself more seriously, and he seems to have achieved it. He looks smarter for a start and uses less of the 'Cripes, Crikey' Just William mannerisms. I wondered if, at age 44, he was quite relieved to shed some of his buffoon image?</p> <p>'Yes. The terrible truth, Lynn, is that the buffoon stuff clings to you like a burr and I'm afraid there's only so much auto-lobotomy I can do! The inner buffoon has a way of emerging! But I think the truth is that people did recognise that I was extremely serious about the mayoralty. At the end of a pretty exhausting nine-month campaign - it really went on and on and on - the proposition that I wasn't going to take it seriously was tested more or less to destruction.'</p> <p>He has also managed to suppress some of his old desire to be liked and learnt to be more ruthless. 'You have to. And indeed you realise that there's a great selfishness in endlessly trying to be liked - it is terribly selfish. People elect you to do the tough things, because that's what you're there for. So yes. We had to reduce the London Development Agency considerably and lost about 93 people, and it's tough. And there will be things that I will have to do in the future which will also be tough. But to shirk them is selfish.' </p> <p>Whether getting rid of Sir Ian Blair counted as tough is debatable, but it certainly marked a bold annexation of power. Simon Jenkins called it the moment when the mayoralty came of age. Actually, we can almost presage the change in Boris from his novel, Seventy Two Virgins, published in 2004. ('Ohmigod,' says Boris when I mention it, 'you've read my novel? That's the most exciting thing I've heard for weeks.') The protagonist, Roger Barlow, is an MP, older and less intelligent than Boris, but similar in many respects. He is coolly observed throughout the novel by his American research assistant, Cameron, who finds him puzzling. She admires him in some ways - 'He worked prodigiously hard. He got things done' - but she looks in vain for 'a knuckle of principle in the opaque minestrone of his views' and keeps wondering what, if any, are his ideals, his values, his core beliefs. He seems to say one thing to one person, the opposite to another; he also often spoils what should be a serious speech by putting in throwaway jokes. The Cameron commentary in the novel is tantamount to a critique of the old buffoon Boris by the new serious Boris, and perhaps an insight into the self-analysis that led him to change.</p> <p>The novel also offers some insight into his views on women - always his weak point in my view. He has never been a friend to working women and there are plenty of digs at them in his columns. In the novel, Roger Barlow belatedly decides that he is going to work at his marriage. He makes a list of things he must do - pick up wet towels and put the electric toothbrush back on its stand; not fart under the duvet or leave half-eaten tins of tuna under the bed. Above all, he resolves, 'I'm going to start listening properly when she talks to me. I'm going to communicate. I'm going to stay awake after lights out, because it's always worth it in the end. I'm going to understand that the important thing is not to solve problems, but to discuss them. After 15 years, I'm going to get the point that marriage is not a final act; it's like a meeting of the European agricultural ministers, an endless negotiation of insolubles.' It doesn't sound too hopeful.</p> <p>According to his biographer and friend, Andrew Gimson, Boris has had no end of affairs, not just the two with Petronella Wyatt and Anna Fazackerley that made it to the tabloids. Gimson takes the line that, of course, we can't expect politicians to live like monks, ho ho, but I feel this is never a great selling point with women voters. Given that everyone agrees that Boris's wife, Marina (daughter of the late Charles Wheeler), is just about the nicest woman in the world, and also given that Boris's mother was made so unhappy by his father's philandering that she had a long and serious nervous breakdown, you'd have thought Boris would have learnt to keep it in his trousers, or at least be very, very discreet. But, according to Gimson, he was always canoodling with women in the backs of taxis, and it was pure luck that no cabbie ever shopped him.</p> <p>One of the great quotes in Gimson's book, though unfortunately unattributed, is: 'As well as being a philanderer, he's a great family man.' I can see it might be true in an odd way, and asked Boris if it was. This brought on one of his yelping, snorting, hair-rummaging routines to give him time to devise his answer and eventually it came: 'I took a sort of vow ages ago that when bowled any kind of ball like that, the great thing to do is to watch it very carefully for as long as possible as it flies through the air, and then you stick your bat straight out, put your foot forward, block it and retire into your crease. That's the only way to deal with that one.' </p> <p>Right. So he doesn't want to take this opportunity to deny that he is a philanderer or to say that he is a reformed character? More yelps - and then the sturdy blocking of the ball.

  "<p>Apart from one tiny spot of grease on her pink jumper, you would never know that Anjum Anand, TV chef and cookbook writer, is halfway through cooking lunch for 13 guests - four of whom are celebrated chefs - as she ignores her fiercely sizzling pan of stuffed chillies to fasten her three-year-old daughter's wristwatch. She is still smiling as Mahi skitters off to play with her cousin Maia, and turns her attention back to her frying pan. In short, Anand, 36, is far from the sweaty, exasperated mess that most of us turn into the moment our dinner-party guests are out of sight. In spite of the collection of Michelin stars sitting in her living room, snacking on Quorn samosas and waiting for lunch, she is unfazed and virtually immaculate.</p> <p>'I was a bit nervous about cooking for such a lot of chefs,' she says, pushing chillies around the pan, 'but I thought they would probably enjoy some simple home cooking, nothing fancy, because it would be different for them, and it's less scary for me.' Consequently, today's lunch is Anand's take on traditional Punjabi dishes (her family is from the Punjab and her parents emigrated from Delhi to London some 45 years ago), but with her signature twist - which is to take Indian specialities and make them both simpler and lighter. The roomy top-floor flat she shares with her daughter and husband is in Belsize Park, north London, but she got the lunch ingredients from West Hendon, about 25 minutes away. 'There is one road of Indian shops where I always go, because I know they do the freshest raw ingredients. I do my \"Indian shop\" there once a week. But I get my spices from India - my mother-in-law, who stays every summer, brings them over for me: she'll check out what I've got and say, \"Your cumin is too weak\" or whatever, and get me fresh ones.'</p> <p>Her guests are having those little samosas to start with, accompanied by a fresh and zingy green chutney made with coriander and mint. Then there will be chickpea curry with bhatura, a puffed-up fried bread, or rice for anyone who is avoiding oil, spiced potatoes, crispy strips of deep-fried okra and stuffed chillies with a calming yoghurt sauce flavoured with cumin seeds. There's also a salad of tomato, cucumber, red onion and coriander, topped with grated coconut. 'That's not traditional,' Anand points out. 'I'm making this in the south-Indian style.' Just before serving the salad she rustles up a dressing by quickly frying some cumin seeds, mustard seeds and curry leaves, which she tosses into the salad with the juice of a lemon. </p> <p>There is no meat or fish for lunch today, as Anand's husband (who is away) is a Jain, and so she never cooks meat in the house. 'I sometimes feel a little bit as though our guests suffer for his vegetarianism,' says Anand, 'so I made these Quorn samosas taste as much like keema [minced meat, usually lamb] as possible. One of the chefs actually did think they were meat!' </p> <p>Anand herself won't be eating much either. 'Twice a year there is a fast for nine days, which I have been doing since I was 16. A lot of women in India do it, although I only know four girls here who do. It coincides with Indian harvest time and it's for the Hindu goddess Durga. It means I will not eat any grains: no wheat, rice, lentils, chickpeas or anything that can be made into flour, and no onion or garlic, only root vegetables, fruit and yoghurt, and certainly no meat. So today I will just be eating the potatoes.' For Anand this is as much about having a detox as about religion: 'At home when I was growing up, this would be a time of prayer, which is not so much the case now, but none the less, it still feels like a very good thing to do.'</p> <p>As a teenager, Anand struggled with her weight, and it was this that led her to look at adapting the food she ate at home - in the end she lost over 30 kilos. 'I lived at home until I married four years ago, so in my early twenties, I went into my mother's kitchen and asked her lots of questions - why was she doing this or that, why do you use oil here or there?' The more she learnt, the more hooked she got, and so in order to figure out how to fit cooking into a career, she went to work in a hotel kitchen as a waitress, for a catering company and even in a fast-food restaurant, though her degree is in European business. </p> <p>'It's so much fun working in a team - I loved working in a restaurant environment - and it's what I miss most when I'm working alone, writing recipe books. But it was very hectic and I realised that to make it work I would have to give everything to the industry for years, and I wanted a family. When we got married my husband and I sat down and we realised that this kind of work wasn't going to be compatible with that.' </p> <p>Still determined to forge a career in food, Anand went straight to Books for Cooks, London's biggest dedicated cookery bookshop and asked them if they had any books on healthy Indian food, which they didn't. Next she researched the names of the publishing houses that produced cookbooks, and the editors who worked on them. </p> <p>'I even downloaded a sheet on how to write a book proposal off the internet.' Finally, her first book, Indian Every Day, was published in 2005. This got her noticed by the BBC, which gave Anand her own series last year, Indian Food Made Easy, and which was so successful that her next starts in November, along with a third book, Anjum's New Indian. Now, it's her mother who uses Anand's cookbooks.</p> <p>'Terrifyingly, they've just shown the last series in India,' she says, mixing a handful of pomegranate seeds into her homemade Indian lemonade (still water, lemon, sugar, mint and a touch of salt - a relic from the days when it was made for workers in the fields). </p> <p>'I really expected people to turn around and say, \"Who is this girl from London, who has never even lived in India, to tell us how to cook our food?\" but the reaction has been amazingly positive. I think that what is happening in India now is that a lot more women are working, and there simply isn't the time to cook elaborately. My recipes have just come at a good time because I'm not removing any of the flavours that they love, but I am making them easier to achieve. For example, I have a recipe for oven-fried chilli chicken, which is very easy and which I get emails from India asking for, but 40 years ago, most people in India didn't have ovens. Also, I've come at a good time as there are no young cooks on television in India.'</p> <p>At the dining table, everything is ready to be served up, and Anand is still showing no sign of nerves, despite the presence of Vineet Bhatia and his wife Rashima (of Michelin-starred Rasoi Vineet Bhatia in London), Alfred Prasad (head chef at Michelin-starred Tamarind) and his wife Sunita Panjabi, plus Mehernosh Mody (chef at La Porte des Indes) as well as award-winning chef Udit Sarkhel and Radhika Verma from Mango and Silk. They are joined by Anand's friends Angela and Meera, plus her husband's brother and his wife Nivedita who are visiting from Calcutta, and two in-laws. </p> <p>Conversation veers from the credit crunch, to the etymology of the word Parsi, to the advantages of cooking with pomegranate seeds. More or less the only point of agreement is that Anand's lunch is delicious, something she hears with a flicker of relief. Silence only falls again when the dishes are cleared and dessert appears - carrot and kheer, made with cardamom, cooked carrot and sweet, thickened milk. Then, suddenly, it's three o'clock and the chefs have to head back to their own kitchens, no doubt considerably less calm than Anjum Anand's.</p> <p><strong>Rich chickpea curry</strong></p> <p>A rich, spicy chickpea dish from the region of Punjab that is normally paired with a soft, fried flat bread called bhatura but naan works well, too. Serve with a raita or yoghurt. </p> <p>Serves 6</p> <p>4 tbs vegetable oil</p> <p>1\u00bd tsp cumin seeds</p> <p>1 tsp carom seeds</p> <p>1 medium onion, made into a fine paste with the help of a splash of water</p> <p>20g ginger, peeled, halved lengthways and half sliced into thin julienne</p> <p>3 fat cloves garlic, peeled</p> <p>3 medium tomatoes, quartered and pur\u00e9ed </p> <p>3 x 400g cans of chickpeas, drained and rinsed</p> <p>\u00bd tsp red chilli powder</p> <p>2 tsp coriander powder</p> <p>salt to taste</p> <p>1 tsp garam masala</p> <p>\u00bd tsp dried pomegranate powder</p> <p>Heat the oil in a large non-stick saucepan. Add the cumin and carom seeds and once they have sizzled for 5 seconds add the ginger julienne and the onion paste. Cook until the onions have browned well, around 10-12 minutes, stir often once the moisture has reduced.</p> <p>Meanwhile pur\u00e9e the garlic and remaining ginger with a splash of water to a smooth paste. Pour this into the pan once the onions have cooked and cook until the moisture has reduced and the paste fries for 20-30 seconds. Add the pur\u00e9ed tomatoes, salt and all the spices. Bring to a boil then simmer, covered for 20 minutes or until the masala has completely reduced and the oil has been released. Add the chickpeas, stir well then add enough water to come close to the top level of the chickpeas. Bring to a boil, simmer for 5 minutes and serve. <br><strong><br>Fried spiced okra</strong></p> <p>Chaat masala is a blend of spices and is the key flavouring in this dish, but if you don't have any and prefer a simpler dish, give the recipe a go anyway as this is the best way to cook okra. They need to be cooked when you want to eat them as they do not reheat well.</p> <p>Serves 4-6</p> <p>400g okra, wiped clean with damp kitchen paper, topped and tailed</p> <p>4 tbs gram flour</p> <p>vegetable oil, for frying</p> <p>1 tsp chaat masala</p> <p>\u00bc tsp salt</p> <p>\u00bc tsp red chilli powder</p> <p>\u00bc tsp dried mango powder</p> <p>Slice the okra pieces lengthwise into quarters. Toss with the gram flour. Heat the oil to a moderate-high heat in a large saucepan. Add all or half the okra, depending on the size of your pan. Fry for about 8 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the okra becomes crispy, with some just turning a rich golden brown colour. Turn the okra onto a plate lined with kitchen paper to drain, then tip into a bowl with the chaat masala, salt, chilli and dried mango powder and toss together. Serve hot.</p> <p><strong>Carrot kheer</strong></p> <p>I'm not convinced that words alone will persuade you to try a chilled dessert of creamy, thickened milk with softened floating threads of sweet carrots . But in just the same way that carrot cake may seem initially unpalatable, the proof is in the tasting, so do give this a go.</p> <p>Serves 6</p> <p>1 litre full-fat milk</p> <p>250g carrots, peeled and grated</p> <p>3-4 tbs sugar</p> <p>good pinch of saffron strands</p> <p>-\u00bd tsp green cardamom seeds, powdered</p> <p>2 tbs pistachios, chopped</p> <p>2 tbs flaked almonds, toasted caramelised pine nuts, to serve</p> <p>Heat the milk in a wide, heavy-based saucepan, stirring and scraping the base with the spoon frequently to make sure the milk does not catch and burn. Keep cooking until it reduces by about one third - this takes about 25 minutes. </p> <p>Add the carrots and continue cooking for another 15-25 minutes or until they are soft and the milk is as thick as you like it - I like it quite thin but others like it quite thick; you will need to keep up the stirring though. Stir in the sugar, saffron and cardamom powder, cook for another 2 minutes and taste for sweetness. Chilling any food dulls its sweetness, so you may need to add a little more than you think. Cool and then place in the fridge, covered with clingfilm as milk absorbs flavours from other food in the fridge. When ready to eat, serve in bowls sprinkled with the nuts.</p> <p><strong>Stuffed jalape\u00f1o chillies in yoghurt</strong></p> <p>Most supermarkets sell these large, fat green chillies which are ideal for stuffing. If using jalape\u00f1os, try to find large ones as the stuffing takes away from the heat, as does the yoghurt. SERVES 4 </p> <p>8 large, fat green chillies</p> <p>1 medium-large potato, boiled, skin removed and mashed</p> <p>2 tbs vegetable oil, plus an extra 1 tsp</p> <p>1 tsp mustard seeds</p> <p>\u00be tsp cumin seeds</p> <p>\u00bd tsp large fennel seeds</p> <p>2-3 tbs water</p> <p>2\u00bd tbs desiccated coconut</p> <p>7 tbs yoghurt</p> <p>salt, to taste</p> <p>15 curry leaves</p> <p>for the stuffing:</p> <p>\u00bc tsp turmeric</p> <p>\u00bd tsp ground cumin </p> <p>\u00bd-1 tsp lemon juice, to taste</p> <p>1 tbs chopped onion, softened in 2tsp </p> <p>vegetable oil (optional)</p> <p>salt, to taste</p> <p>Blanch the chillies in boiling salted water for 2 minutes, then drain on kitchen paper. Slit the chillies on the straightest side to make a pocket. Scoop out the seeds and membranes and discard. Add the stuffing ingredients to the mashed potato and mix together well. Stuff the chillies with just enough mixture to fill. Heat 2 tbs of the oil in a large frying pan. Add \u00bd tsp each of the mustard and cumin seeds and, when they pop, add the fennel seeds. </p> <p>Cook for another 20 seconds, then add the chillies. Saut\u00e9 over a low heat, making sure they do not lose their shape, about 7-9 minutes. Meanwhile, whisk the water and coconut into the yoghurt and season. Heat the remaining oil in a small pan and add the remaining mustard and cumin seeds and the curry leaves. Cook for 20-30 seconds and stir into the yoghurt. Leave to cool while the chillies finish cooking. To serve, place the chillies on a plate and pour the yoghurt over. </p> <p>Anjum's New Indian (Quadrille, \u00a320) is out now.

  "<p>Britain has jumped out of the frying pan of the financial crisis and into the fire of a severe economic slowdown, the Ernst and Young Item Club will warn this week, just days before the release of GDP figures widely expected to provide the first official confirmation that a recession is already underway.</p> <p>'Even if the equity markets stabilise and we begin to see capital flowing around the international banking system again, we are still looking at a domestic and global economy that will be in recession for the next 12 months,' said Peter Spencer, the Item Club's economic adviser.</p> <p>The first official reading of GDP for the third quarter of this year will be published on Friday, and City analysts expect it to show a sharp decline, after growth ground to a halt between April and June. The usual definition of a recession is two successive quarters of contraction.</p> <p>'This will be seen by most as confirmation of the UK's first recession for 18 years,' said Danny Gabay, of consultancy Fathom, adding 'at this stage the big unknown is how big, deep and long a recession is likely to unfold'.</p> <p>Item expects GDP to decline outright next year by 1 per cent - the first full-year decline since 1991. It predicts a gradual recovery in 2010, with the economy recording growth of just 1 per cent.</p> <p>Spencer said consumer spending would be hit hard over the next two years, as households try to rebuild their finances in the face of sickly income growth and plunging property prices.</p> <p>'Last year consumers were able to handle the income squeeze by borrowing and dipping into their savings. This year it is a very different story with credit harder to access and far more expensive,' he said.</p> <p>He expects the Bank of England to follow up its co-ordinated half-point rate cut earlier this month with further reductions, beginning with another half-point in November, and taking them down to 3 per cent. Mervyn King, the Bank's governor, will set out his assessment of the economic outlook in a speech this week.</p> <p>Michael Saunders, of Citigroup, warned that despite the \u00a337bn bank bailout, which has begun to restore some calm to money markets, 'most of the economic pain lies ahead'. He said the economy has been pulled out of balance by 'the lemming-like willingness of households and businesses to see higher debts as a way to riches', and now that they are seeing the value of their homes and investments decline, they are likely to be tightening their belts for a long time.</p>",
  "<p>Britain is ignoring the dangers posed by one of the world's worst air pollutants: ozone. Researchers say that levels of the gas - a powerful contributor to global warming and the cause of hundreds of deaths a year from respiratory illnesses - are rising at an alarming rate. </p> <p>They have also warned that measures to curtail the gas are failing. As a result, ozone-related deaths, of which there are about 1,500 a year in the UK, could rise by 50 per cent over the next decade. Stronger international treaties need to be set up to counter the threat, they insist.</p> <p>'A lot more interest needs to be taken in ozone - not only as a cause of global warming but as an immediate threat to human health and to the environment,' said Professor Piers Foster of Leeds University, an author of the most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. 'It could have a significant impact on the planet.'</p> <p>Ozone is produced by the impact of sunlight on atmospheric pollutants, including car exhausts, and is strongly associated with smogs caused by traffic fumes. Hot summers, in areas polluted with nitrogen oxides and volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) emitted by vehicles, produce peak levels of ozone. Unlike ozone in the stratosphere, which protects Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation, ozone in the lower atmosphere is harmful to humans, animals and plants.</p> <p>The EU has introduced measures to reduces these pollutants, mainly by ensuring three-way converters are fitted to cars, and this has helped reduce ozone production in Europe. But countries such as Russia, China and India are still major emitters, and ozone from these nations is constantly being blown over Britain. As a result, levels are continuing to rise at a rate of 6 per cent per decade.</p> <p>'The trouble is that ozone production is controlled by a patchwork of local laws and regulations,' said Professor David Fowler of the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, Edinburgh, leader of a recent Royal Society working group on ozone. 'Weather systems and jet streams transport ozone and the pollutants that trigger its production far from its point of origin. In addition, shipping is a major producer. </p> <p>'So you could introduce all sorts of measures to cut down local emissions, but these reductions would be overwhelmed by the ozone and the nitrogen oxide pollutants being swept over the country from marine and from foreign sources. Until we get an integrated network of international agreements in place, we will never get round the problem. At present no efforts are being made to set these up, however.'</p> <p>Rising production of ozone is alarming because the gas is the third biggest contributor to global warming. Only carbon dioxide and methane have bigger impacts. But unlike them ozone also affects health. It is a powerful oxidant and damages lung tissue. In 2003 it caused more than 1,500 deaths in the UK - mainly among children and the elderly - and that figure is set to rise to about 2,400 a year by 2020.</p> <p>In addition, the gas has a serious impact on the ecology. Ozone enters plants through respiratory pores in their leaves and harms their ability to photosynthesise foodstuffs. Plants are left weak and undersized. It is estimated that in 2000, ozone caused \u00a35bn damage to crops in Europe, a figure that is rising by the year.</p> <p>Even worse, trees and vegetation damaged by ozone cannot properly absorb carbon dioxide and the gas therefore has a double impact on the climate: it helps raise the temperature of the atmosphere and it hinders the planet's ability to cope with other greenhouse gases. Thus limiting ozone production should be given greater priority, a point stressed by Professor Peter Cox of Exeter University.</p> <p>'We estimate that these effects on plants could double the importance of ozone increases in the lower atmosphere as a driver of climate change,' he said. 'So policies to limit increase in ozone must be seen as an even higher priority.'</p> <h2>The danger hole</h2> <p>Ozone is harmful at sea level but in the stratosphere, six to 31 miles high, it forms a <strong>protective layer </strong>which blots out the sun's powerful ultra-violet radiation. In 1985, scientists discovered a <strong>growing hole</strong> in this layer over Antarctica which had been caused by <strong>made-made chemicals</strong> in the atmosphere. Bans on these products should close the ozone hole, but not until 2060.</p>",
  "<p>It must have been sometime in 1979, or maybe 1980, when I saw Freddie Toal on the evening news. I remember that I was sitting in the living room of a flat in Kensal Rise, north London with some friends, when someone shouted out his name and I looked up and there he was, bedraggled and barely recognisable; a lad from home. </p> <p>He was not someone I knew very well, but I distinctly remembered him from the early years of the Troubles when we had both been involved in the rioting that was part of daily life in the Nationalist areas of Armagh. Back then, Freddie Toal had longish black hair and wore the young, working class uniform of denim jacket and jeans. On the news that night, though, he was wearing only a blanket, and was standing in a cell in the Maze prison. His hair was long, his face gaunt and the walls around him were smeared with his own excrement. He looked familiar but utterly altered.</p> <p>'For a long time, when I was on the blanket, I had no real idea what I looked like,' he says, some 30 years later, his long hair now gone, his speech quiet and measured. 'The only time I ever saw my face was this one time when the screws were sweeping piss into our cells. The sun suddenly shone through the window and, for a few seconds, I saw my reflection in a pool of piss. It sounds funny but it took me a while to register it was me. I looked like a wild man.'</p> <p>In Steve McQueen's much anticipated film, Hunger, which opens at the end of the month, there is a scene that must surely have been based on that image: two young men, scared but defiant, standing in a shit-smeared cell. It is powerful but not nearly as haunting as the footage that inspired it. The film tells the story of Bobby Sands, the leader of the IRA hunger strike of 1981, and the most iconic Republican figure to emerge out of the Troubles. It does not tell the whole story though, ending instead at the moment of Sands's death. The nine men who followed his example are mentioned only in a footnote. The mass protest that attended their deaths is never alluded to, nor the murderous violence that occurred across the already beleaguered province at the time.</p> <p>Both Freddie Toal and his close friend, Sean McGerrigan, were in the Maze prison at the same time as Bobby Sands. Having seen the film, I wanted to hear their story. We arranged to meet in a community centre near the Roman Catholic cathedral in Armagh, the town that we all grew up in and where, to varying degrees, we were politicised by the early years of the Troubles. I never graduated beyond the rioting stage, though, nor did I embrace hardcore Republicanism. I guess I was too interested in girls and rock music, and could not wait to leave Armagh. And, besides, I was scared of guns, and of those that wielded them. Back then, the Brits - and the RUC - were the enemy but I did not hate them enough to even think about killing them. Nor did I really believe in dying for Ireland; it just did not enter my mind.</p> <p>At that time, you only found out for certain who was 'involved' when they were 'lifted' by the British army in a dawn raid, or went 'on the run' across the border, or, in some cases, were shot dead while on what the IRA called 'active service'. Freddie Toal was 20 when he was arrested on a dawn raid in 1977. He was subsequently charged with, as he casually puts it, 'possession of rifles and carrying out some knee-cappings in the town'. Sean McGerrigan followed him into the H Blocks the following year. He was just 17 when he was 'lifted' from his family house in nearby Callan Street in 1978; he was subsequently charged with attempted murder and possession of firearms. </p> <p>In a way, his arrest was not that surprising. His brother, Peter McGerrigan, whom everyone knew by his nickname, Jake, was shot dead by a single bullet fired by a British soldier on the Windmill Hill housing estate in 1973. He was the first IRA volunteer to be killed by the British army in Armagh. He was just 18 years old. 'Jake McGerrigan was the year above me in school,' remembers Freddie Toal. 'He was the first of my generation to die fighting for Ireland. At his wake, I knew I had to avenge his death. The first thing I did was join the Fianna \u00c9ireann [Young IRA]. Before that, I just rioted and threw stones, but then I wanted the gun. If you had told me back then, at 17, what was ahead of me, I would not have believed you.'</p> <p>The blanket protest was already under way when he entered the H Blocks in January 1977, and he went straight on it. In 1976 the British government had decided to phase out special category status for convicted terrorists as part of a bigger process known as 'criminalisation'. Both Republican and Loyalist prisoners, who had until then been granted special category status, were now to be treated as common criminals. The protest began on 14 September 1976, when Kieran Nugent, the first IRA man to be convicted for terrorist offences under the new policy, reputedly said to a prison guard: 'If you want me to wear that uniform, you're going to have to nail it to my back.' He was given a blanket and escorted to his cell. Other IRA prisoners followed his example, and in 1978 the mass blanket protest turned into the dirty protest when IRA prisoners refused to leave their cells following another violent dispute, this time over a demand for extra towels in the communal washrooms. The prisoners' policy of non-cooperation meant that they were often confined for days on end in their tiny concrete cells with just a blanket, a mattress and a Bible. Refusing to wash or slop out, they began emptying their urine out over the floor and smearing their excrement on the walls.</p> <p>Another emotive scene in Hunger shows two prisoners sleeping on dirty mattresses while maggots wriggle in the mounds of rotting food and excrement that have been pushed into the corners. Was it, I ask Toal, who remained on the blanket for four years, really that bad? 'It was worse,' he says. 'For years afterwards I had nightmares about it. I'd wake up drenched in sweat, thinking I was back there.' </p> <p>Back then, the most vivid description of their conditions came from Cardinal O'Fiaich, the then-Roman Catholic Primate of All Ireland, who visited the prison in 1978. 'I was shocked by the inhuman conditions prevailing in H Blocks 3, 4 and 5, where over 300 prisoners are incarcerated,' he said. 'One would hardly allow an animal to remain in such conditions let alone a human being.' O'Fiaich compared the H Blocks to 'the slums of Calcutta', adding: 'The stench and filth in some of the cells, with the remains of rotten food and human excreta around the walls, was almost unbearable. In two of them I was unable to speak for fear of vomiting.'</p> <p>His public statement prompted a response from the Northern Ireland Office, which began: 'These criminals are totally responsible for the situation in which they find themselves. It is they who have been smearing excreta on the walls and pouring urine through the cell doors. It is they who by their actions are denying themselves the excellent modern facilities of the prison.' </p> <p>The conflicting tone and message of those two statements, the one emotive and outraged, the other detached and clinical, prefigured the coming battle of wills between Republicans and the British state. In the eyes of the British government, led by Margaret Thatcher, the prisoners were simply murderers and gangsters and were to be treated accordingly. To the Nationalist population of Northern Ireland, who were becoming increasingly agitated about conditions inside the H Blocks, they were political prisoners standing up for a defining principle of Republicanism. To complicate matters further, word was filtering out of the Maze about the often violent ill treatment of the Republican Catholic prisoners by their mainly Loyalist Protestant prison officers.</p> <p>Toal and McGerrigan also talk quite calmly about the beatings they say they received 'on a regular basis' from their mainly Loyalist prison officers. They often occurred, they say, when they were being returned to their cells after Sunday Mass, or after a visit from someone on the outside.</p> <p>The IRA leadership inside the prison communicated with their counterparts on the outside through 'comms', tiny rolled up pieces of paper inscribed with minuscule writing that were secreted in prisoner's mouths, anuses, or underneath their foreskins. Toal describes how he was often 'grabbed by my hands and feet by four screws and spread over a mirror on the floor like a chicken, while a so-called medical officer officer stuck his fingers inside my ass.'</p> <p>Did they ever feel like giving in, abandoning their protest? 'What you have to understand was there was incredible camaraderie in there,' says McGerrigan. 'You always took strength from the fact that there were so many men on the protest. After a beating, the prisoners would often start singing Republican songs though the doors just to do the screws' heads in.' Toal concurs, though at times he has a haunted look when he talks about his experiences. 'It never entered my head to give up but I was always afraid of breaking under the beatings. You always had to be strong, not show weakness, keep your principles.'</p> <p>They tell me there were some 'decent screws' but that most of them were, as McGerrigan puts it, 'just plain sectarian'. One senior prison officer in the Maze at that time was a man called Paddy Joe Kerr, one of the few Catholics in the Northern Ireland Prison Service. He grew up close to where Sean McGerrigan did, and joined the prison service before the Troubles started. 'He had the power to stop the beatings but he never did,' says Toal. 'He was systemised against us,' adds McGerrigan. In 1985 Paddy Joe Kerr was shot dead by the IRA on the steps of Armagh cathedral as he and his young son were leaving Sunday Mass. </p> <p>By 1980 there were over 400 IRA prisoners on the blanket in the Maze and in Armagh women's prison. Their conditions and harsh treatment had now become a major focus of protest. More chillingly, the IRA had responded to the brutality inside the prison by targeting prison officers on the outside. By January of that year, 18 had been killed. As the dirty protest dragged on, and morale among the beleaguered prisoners began to waver, certain influential IRA men inside the H Blocks began to put pressure on the Army Council on the outside to be allowed to use the most extreme tactic of all: a hunger strike. </p> <p>The hunger striker has an almost mythological status in the annals of Irish Republicanism. Before 1981 the most celebrated hunger striker was Terence McSwiney, Lord Mayor of Cork, who died in Brixton prison in 1920 after 74 days. One part of his inaugural speech could just as easily have described the Republican mindset half a century later: 'The contest on our side is not one of rivalry or vengeance, but of endurance. It is not those who can inflict the most but those who can suffer the most who will conquer.' </p> <p>On 27 October 1980 the first IRA hunger strike inside the H Blocks began. It ended in confusion on 18 December in what the Irish writer and historian Tim Pat Coogan called 'a burst of prison poker, which the authorities at first believed they had won'. No lives were lost but Republican prisoners realised quickly that they had been outplayed, and that none of their demands for special category status had been met. In November the Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, had spelt out the British government's stance: 'Let me make one point about the hunger strike in the Maze Prison. I want this to be utterly clear. There can be no political justification for murder or any other crime. The government will never concede political status to the hunger strikers or to any others convicted of a criminal offence in the province.' The stage was set for the second and final round of what would be a bloody and protracted battle, and one in which Thatcher would face someone even more intransigent than herself. </p> <p>Freddie Toal recalls the moment he met Bobby Sands. 'It was 18 December 1980, the day the first hunger strike ended. He came into our cell. I remember he was stroking his beard as he spoke and you could see by the look of him that he was shattered. There were screws behind him so he spoke in Irish. He just said \"Ni bhfuair faic\" (\"We got nothing\"). Then he told us that there was going to be another hunger strike, and this time it would be to the end. He said: \"I will lead it, and I will die.\" That was the last thing he said to us.'</p> <p>The second IRA hunger strike, which began on 1 March 1981, was planned by Sands to develop in ever more dramatic stages, one man following another to his death. Sands himself was the first to die after 66 days without food. By then he had become a British MP, having famously taken the Fermanagh and South Tyrone seat on 9 April 1981. In death he became, for a time at least, an icon. An estimated 100,000 people attended his funeral in Belfast on 5 May, streets were named after him in Paris and Tehran, and according to Tim Pat Coogan: 'The French government offered the Dublin government two gestures of solidarity, which Dublin declined. One was to boycott the British royal wedding, the other that President Mitterrand attend Bobby Sands's funeral.' </p> <p>Another nine IRA prisoners would starve themselves to death before the hunger strike was called off in October 1981. In the tense seven months it lasted, violence in Northern Ireland reached a pitch that recalled the dark days of the early Seventies: 61 people died, over half of them civilians, including a girl of 11 hit by a plastic bullet; 30 members of the security forces were killed by the IRA.</p> <p>I went home to Armagh for a short family visit in the late summer of 1981, and I can still remember the mood of dread, anger and simmering violence that seemed to have taken hold of the place. In a bar frequented by middle-class Catholics, school teachers, doctors and the like, I heard a collective hiss of pure hatred turn into a tumult of abuse when Margaret Thatcher appeared on the television in the corner. There was a cheer when the bar manager reached up and switched channels. Thatcher, it seemed, had galvanised the Catholic middle classes into voting for Sinn F\u00e9in. They have continued to do so, in ever-increasing numbers, ever since. </p> <p>Before the hunger strike, Sands had collected the names of over 70 IRA men who were prepared to fast until death. I ask Toal and McGerrigan if either of them considered putting their names forward. 'No, never,' replies McGerrigan. Freddie Toal just shakes his head. </p> <p>The following day I travelled up to Belfast to meet a man who did volunteer for the IRA hunger strike. His name is Pat Sheehan. He spent 55 days without food, and was approaching death when the hunger strike was called off, mainly because of intervention from relatives of the starving men. Sheehan is currently, he says, 'self-employed', and lives in a well-off, middle-class neighbourhood on the outskirts of west Belfast. He has a degree in philosophy, obtained while in the Maze Prison. The night before, he had watched Hunger, and was eager to talk about what he called 'the weird mixture of feelings it brought up'. </p> <p>Did the film, I ask, chime with his experiences of the H Blocks at that time? 'Most of the time, it did. The camaraderie was missing, though. But everything else was pretty accurate, the conditions, the beatings, the grimness of the blocks. It brought it all back.' </p> <p>Sheehan was arrested in February 1978 and charged with causing an explosion in the centre of Belfast. He received a 15-year sentence and moved to the H Blocks in March 1979. 'You were given a blanket and you went down to your wing,' he says, smiling at the memory. 'I was feeling apprehensive, a bit scared, and half expecting a beating from the screws as a welcome. It seemed very quiet, then I heard someone shout in Irish, \"New man on the block!\" and all hell broke loose. There was cheering and shouting and men banging the pisspots on the doors. I thought, the morale is high, the lads aren't cowed. It was,' he says, grinning, 'like walking out on to Croke Park to play for your county in an All-Ireland Final.' </p> <p>Sheehan said he put his name down for both IRA hunger strikes 'without hesitation'. He agrees now that this was 'a brutal thing to do' to his family. 'Absolutely, absolutely,' he says, nodding, 'but the thing was, and this came across in the film, we were absolutely focused. You had to be. So that nothing could deflect you.'</p> <p>When his parents and his older sister came to visit him, he waited for the right moment to break the news to his father. Instead, his father broke some bad news to him. 'He hung back after the others left, and whispered to me that my sister had just been diagnosed with leukemia and given five years to live. Looking back on it now,' he says, quietly, 'it might seem very callous of me to have gone ahead with a hunger strike in those circumstances, to take that decision when they were going through this awful moment. But I had made up my mind. I could not let the other men down.' </p> <p>How did his family react to his decision? 'They were devastated. Absolutely devastated. I can still remember the look on their faces when I told them. It was a terrible thing to see.' He says that his father 'became politicised during the hunger strike even though he was anti-violence to the day he died'. </p> <p>Nine men had already died when Sheehan began his hunger strike, and the 10th, Mickey Devine, died soon afterwards. 'In a way, you couldn't let their deaths affect you too much. I wasn't surprised when Bobby [Sands] died because we all knew he was going to go the whole way. It was more the inevitability of it that was terrible, but we stayed strong because we had to.'</p> <p>Was there a moment during his own hunger strike when he had any doubts about his decision? He thinks for a moment. 'Well, I was going into uncharted territory, so of course I had some doubts. Would I be able to carry it through to the end? I was as sure as I could be but, strangely enough, as time went on and I grew weaker physically, I became stronger psychologically until there was no doubt in my mind. Day by day, I became more certain.'</p> <p>Sheehan talks with remarkably little emotion of what he went through in the 55 days he inched closer to death. He says the worst part was 'the terrible realisation that you were not just feeling sick but becoming seriously ill, your own body rebelling against you'. In the last few days of his ordeal, he says, he was 'still lucid and very, very calm' but could only 'see shadowy, ghostly figures coming in and out of the room'. One of them was a doctor, who told him that even if he ended his fast, he would be permanently damaged and, in fact, might not even live. </p> <p>He tells me proudly that he has 'no lasting effects' from the hunger strike, and, in fact, 'recovered remarkably quickly'. In this, he is the exception: other surviving hunger strikers have had severe problems, usually with their eyesight and kidney function. Sheehan was 'almost totally blind' and 'lapsing in and out of unconsciousness' when the hunger strike was called off. A priest had granted him absolution, given him Communion, and performed the Last Rites over his bed. </p> <p>Can he describe how it felt to be pulled back from the brink of death? He sighs and shakes his head. 'To be honest, I had mixed emotions. On a purely personal level, I was glad that I had survived, but on another level I have to say I felt somehow disappointed, especially as the days went by and I received medical attention and started to recover. I think I had what is called survivor's syndrome. I felt guilty, definitely, about the lads who had died, about their families. And, in terms of the bigger political picture, I felt that stopping the hunger strike would demoralise and undermine the whole struggle.' </p> <p>The year after the hunger strike ended was, according to Sheehan, 'the most demoralising time for Republican prisoners'. Both Toal and McGerrigan had said the same thing. The following year, though, the prisoners had achieved all their aims, and more besides. Segregated from their Loyalist counterparts, and wearing their own clothes, they effectively ran the prison. 'When I was brought into prison in 1990,' the Republican activist and author Danny Morrison told me recently, 'a prison officer asked me if I had everything I needed. Then he said goodnight to me in Irish. Mad!'</p> <p>Why then, one has to ask, did those 10 men die? In one way, as Steve McQueen remarked recently: 'It was as if the whole history of the Troubles, and of Britain's relationship to Ireland, was distilled in that moment. It came down to two opposing and immovable forces: Margaret Thatcher and Bobby Sands.' Morrison, who was an envoy between the Sinn F\u00e9in leadership and the prisoners in 1981, concurs. 'I remember saying to Bobby, Thatcher will not back down. I came away knowing that his mind was set, too, though. He knew what he had to do and how it would end.' </p> <p>'Too long a sacrifice can make a stone of the heart', wrote WB Yeats in his poem, 'Easter, 1916', about the death by execution of Irish Republicanism's founding heroes, among them P\u00e1draig Pearse, whose belief in blood sacrifice and martyrdom seemed at the heart of the IRA hunger strike of 1981. In retrospect, though, the tumultuous events of that time and in particular the election of Bobby Sands, can be viewed as a pivotal moment in Republican thinking, when Pearse's dark ideology reached its terrible crescendo then finally faded. It was the moment when, to paraphrase Danny Morrison, belief in the ballot box began to replace belief in the bullet. Everything that has happened since, including the Good Friday Agreement and Sinn F\u00e9in members taking their places in the Northern Irish Assembly as democratically elected representatives, has emerged out of that terrible summer of 1981. </p> <p>'Things change very slowly,' says Sean McGerrigan, 'and not in the way you expect. People might say that those men died in vain, but they died as part of a greater struggle. There will be a United Ireland but not in the way we envisaged it happening years ago.' </p> <p>Freddie Toal nods his consent. 'It was inevitable what happened,' he says. 'The environment we grew up in politicised us, and the H Blocks politicised us even more deeply. And if you came though what we did on the H Blocks, you have a special bond with the other men who did the same. Maybe it's hard for you to relate to that, just as it is hard to understand why we had to take up the gun, or why someone would choose to starve themselves to death for a principle.' </p> <p>He is right, of course. I have not been through what they have been through. And, despite our shared upbringing, and all that has happened since, I still do not fully understand what drove them to take up the gun or fuelled their monumental endurance, their unshakeable certainty. Nor, though, can I understand why, whatever their reasons for being imprisoned, they were treated in captivity as if they were less than human. Perhaps that is the unanswered question that still echoes most loudly, and alarmingly, in our fragile democracy in these still troubled times. </p> <h2>The toll - Hunger's strike dead</h2> <p><strong>Bobby Sands, aged 27 </strong><br>1 March-5 May 1981 (66 days on strike)</p> <p><strong>Francis Hughes, 25 </strong><br>15 March-12 May (59 days)</p> <p><strong>Raymond McCreesh, 24</strong><br>22 March-21 May (61 days)</p> <p><strong>Patsy O'Hara, 23</strong><br>22 March-21 May (61 days)</p> <p><strong>Joe McDonnell, 29</strong><br>9 May-8 July (61 days)</p> <p><strong>Martin Hurson, 24 </strong><br>28 May-13 July (46 days)</p> <p><strong>Kevin Lynch, 25</strong><br>23 May-1 August (71 days)</p> <p><strong>Kieran Doherty, 25</strong><br>22 May-2 August (73 days)</p> <p><strong>Thomas McElwee, 23</strong><br>8 June-8 August (62 days)</p> <p><strong>Michael Devine, 27</strong><br>22 June-20 August (60 days)</p> <h2>Northern Ireland - a history of protest</h2> <p><strong>1965</strong> The Prime Ministers of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland meet for talks, a move which provokes tension among Unionists. </p> <p><strong>1966 </strong>Loyalist paramilitary group the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) forms in response to the perceived revival of the IRA, on whom they declare war.</p> <p><strong>1968</strong> Protests by the newly formed Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA) descend into violence with loyalists attacking demonstrators.</p> <p><strong>1969</strong> <strong>12 August</strong> Simmering tensions erupt during the Battle of the Bogside which sees violent confrontations in Londonderry between police and nationalists and lasts three days.

  "<p>Google is not the only online phenomenon to be 10 years old this year. Blogging has also come of age - though there will be disagreement about even that, for the blogosphere is an argumentative place. But at least the etymology of the term is not disputed. It comes from 'weblog', a term coined by Jorn Barger in December 1997. This was abbreviated a year later by Peter Merholz to 'blog' (both a noun and a verb). Web-based blogging tools began to emerge in 1998 and went mainstream with the launch of Blogger.com in 1999. From 1998 anyone who could type and press 'send' could become a global publisher, and a new organism entered our media ecosystem.</p> <p>Initially, blogging had a bad press, at least in the press. Editors derided it as vanity publishing by egomaniacs. Who did these oiks think they were, imagining people would be interested in their views? Working journalists - incredulous that people would write for no financial reward - ridiculed blogging as self-indulgent insanity.</p> <p>It turned out that this was an epic misjudgment, but it took a few high-profile casualties to bring home the message. In 2002 the Republican majority leader in the US Senate, Trent Lott, was brought down by a story that was ignored by the mainstream media but kept alive within the blogosphere. Then in 2005 the career of Dan Rather, the celebrated American TV network anchorman, was unceremoniously terminated when he (and his colleagues) casually dismissed bloggers' criticism of the evidence used in a 60 Minutes documentary about George W Bush's national service.</p> <p>One network executive sneered that the people who disputed the authenticity of the (faked) documents relied upon by the programme were nothing more than strange little men who sit at home and 'write in their pyjamas'. Big mistake: the guys in pyjamas knew their stuff.</p> <p>Since then, disdain for blogging has been more muted, but has not entirely disappeared. The most enduring criticism has been that bloggers are not reporters but commentators and are thus parasites on 'proper', professional journalism. This took a bit of a knock during the early days of the Iraq war, when bloggers in Baghdad were the only reliable reporters of what was actually going on. In fact, the professional/amateur criticism is a somewhat simplistic representation of an emerging symbiotic relationship in which journalists and bloggers react to, and feed off, one another.</p> <p>A more insightful perspective comes from regarding blogging as a new literary genre. This is the line taken by Andrew Sullivan, a magazine editor who has metamorphosed into an \u00fcber-blogger, in an essay published in The Atlantic (see <a href=\"http://bit.ly/1IiA0f\">http://bit.ly/1IiA0f</a>). Blogging is to writing, he says, 'what extreme sports are to athletics: more free-form, more accident-prone, less formal, more alive.'</p> <p>Sullivan writes: 'Every writer since the printing press has longed for a means to publish himself and reach - instantly - any reader on Earth. Every professional writer has paid some dues waiting for an editor's nod, enduring a publisher's incompetence, or being ground to dust by a legion of fact-checkers and copy editors. With one click of the Publish Now button, all these troubles evaporated.'</p> <p>So they did - to be replaced by obstreperous criticism from readers of blogs, who have no compunction about pointing out flaws in a blogger's argument and other lapses of fact or character. This openness to immediate criticism and/or rebuttal is another revolutionary aspect of blogging. What we are seeing, wrote Clay Shirky some years ago (available online at <a href=\"http://bit.ly/fkxik\">http://bit.ly/fkxik</a>), is nothing less than the 'mass amateurisation of publishing'. What's happening is a radical shift from the old ecosystem in which publications (newspapers, magazines and books) are filtered and edited before being published, into a world in which anything can be (and is) published.</p> <p>All that remains is for English departments in universities to start studying blogging styles, for example the way in which accomplished online writers use hyperlinks. If you read the work of established bloggers or contributors to slick online publications such as Salon or Slate what you see is a move from having hyperlinks clumsily embedded in a document to the use of links to provide an ironic counterpoint to the main line of the piece. It's all very, er, postmodern. But what do you expect? It is 2008.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:john.naughton@observer.co.uk\">john.naughton@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

  "<p>If foods define decades (think prawn cocktail for the Seventies, balsamic vinegar for the Nineties), then the food of the Noughties is surely the smoothie. Of course, by smoothie, I mean the Innocent kind. The brainchild of three Cambridge graduates, Innocent was set up in 1999, and today has a 72 per cent share of the UK's \u00a3170m smoothie market, selling more than two million drinks a week. But Innocent's epoch-defining character is not just a question of numbers. Few products better reflect the times we live in, or tell us more about what we want our food to be.</p> <p>Innocent's appeal lies in the fact that its smoothies, while seeming so simple (so innocent, in fact), manage to press all the right ethical and social buttons. First of all, there's health. From its name onwards, Innocent makes a great show of how 'natural' and 'pure' its smoothies are. And for once this seems justified, because they contain only fruit and fruit juices. But the 'purity' tag has a second dimension: ecological friendliness. Innocent smoothies are not only good for you; they are good for the world, too. Actually it's debatable how beneficial to the environment a company that ships fruit from all over the globe can be; but Innocent certainly goes out of its way to convince us that it cares passionately about the planet. </p> <p>And this helps get round another problem. The biggest obstacle faced by ethical foods has always been their kooky, 'alternative' image. Now, thanks not only to Innocent but to the likes of Green &amp; Black's and Caf\u00e9direct too, the ethical has become mainstream. Such brands are no longer confined to the health-food shop; you're just as likely to find them in the supermarket. Buying them reflects well on you as a person - if for no other reason than that it proves you have the money - but, crucially, it does not make you a snob. </p> <p>Innocent was one of the first companies to cotton on to all this, and it has mined the potential of ethical consumerism more effectively than anyone else. In doing so, it has helped transform our understanding of what it means to be ethical, tying it up with notions such as aspiration and health. Unquestionably, the existence of Innocent smoothies has made us feel better about ourselves. But has it helped the planet? That's open to debate.</p>",
  "<p>The decision by Ed Miliband, the energy and climate change secretary, to commit Britain to cutting its greenhouse gas emissions by 80 per cent by 2050 is welcome. Recent research has made it clear that the government's previous target of a 60 per cent reduction would be insufficient to help halt profound climate change this century. New measures were required.</p> <p>But we should note that setting goals is the easy part of fighting global warming; implementing them is harder. This point is demonstrated in the report in The Observer today on Britain's wind energy programme. This is supposed to ensure that a third of all UK electricity is generated by onshore and offshore turbines by 2020. But it is now facing collapse, a victim of rising costs, planning blockages and poor investment. Government action is falling well short of its rhetoric.</p> <p>The failure to insist that carbon capture devices be fitted to the proposed new coal-fired power plant at Kingsnorth provides another example. Without such machinery, vast amounts of carbon dioxide will be pumped into the atmosphere, making nonsense of the UK's commitment to combat global warming. Transport policy is similarly unenlightened. The government backs motorway construction schemes and continues to call for cuts in petrol prices, ignoring the environmental implications. It also refuses to include aviation fuel in its climate change calculations - as if ignoring its consumption means it will no longer be heating the planet. Likewise, a commitment to the expansion of UK airports seriously undermines our claim to be climate change champions.</p> <p>The government must establish a consistent attitude to global warming and back this with significant investments. It should provide a national electricity grid that can carry power from remote wind turbines to cities; develop a wave and tidal power energy programme that will take advantage of our marine expertise; and create carbon capture schemes that will allow us to build a new generation of coal power plants.</p> <p>It is also clear that the world's current economic crisis provides no excuse for failing to make proper investments and hard political decisions. The 2006 report by Sir Nicholas Stern showed the costs of acting will be vastly outweighed by the costs of not acting. The government must therefore be resolute - and consistent.</p>",
  "<p>Apologists for neo-liberalism assume not only that states should be run like companies, but also that, as far as possible, they should not intervene in the economy. The market, they insist, regulates itself. But, more than 50 years ago, the Nobel laureate <a href=\"http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/1970/samuelson-bio.html\">Paul Samuelson</a> contradicted this idealisation of markets in graphic terms: absolute freedom for the market will lead to Rockefeller's dog getting the milk that a poor child needs for healthy development, not because of market failure, but because \"goods are placed in the hands of those who pay the most for them\". </p> <p>This distributional quandary lies at the heart of the capitalist system, which is one of never-ending competition fueled by the drive to maximise profits. In such a world, there is no room for a social conscience. </p> <p>It is the state that, to a greater extent in some societies than in others, must fill the gap. The market economy is unsurpassed as a system for creating wealth, but only social compensation ensures that this wealth is distributed in a just manner. Europe's social-market economies, far more than the Anglo-Saxon neo-liberal model, regard mitigating the inequalities created by markets as the state's duty. </p> <p>In fact, the market economy can function only if the state does intervene. The US financial crisis demonstrates what happens when markets are given free rein. Rather than regulate themselves, market players destroy themselves, however much they might be marveled at as golden calves. </p> <p>Indeed, investment bankers transformed stock markets into a surreal circus. For the most part, they resembled high-wire artists juggling borrowed money without a safety net. They threatened to crash \u2013 until the state stepped in. In Fellini's film <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/77281/strada\">La Strada</a>, the circus artists lived on the margins of society; in the Wall Street Circus, they lived like gods, making millions. </p> <p>That's over for a while. Wall Street has collapsed. The present crisis, the fall of Wall Street, is to neo-liberalism what the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 was to communism. </p> <p>The global dimension of this crisis surprisingly also has a positive side. The international community is now charged with thinking about how to reorganise the financial sector and minimise the risk of similar catastrophe in the future. Until now, a major part of the problem was countries' unwillingness to cooperate. Previous demands for stricter regulations came to nothing because of financial sector opposition. When should this stance change if not now? </p> <p>A start needs to be made at the European Council meeting of the heads of state and government in Brussels in mid-October. It is crucial that the European Union accepts the challenge of the financial crisis at the highest level, draws the appropriate conclusions, and takes the logical next steps. </p> <p>So what lessons are to be learned from the failure of the neo-liberal economic model? </p> <p>First, markets need clear rules. Stronger regulation means legally binding, globally applicable rules and standards. While important areas of economic policy are subject to rules that allow penal sanctions, the financial sector has a special status that is no longer acceptable. </p> <p>Those areas of the financial sector that have suffered the most reputational damage are the ones least subject to regulation and supervision: the derivatives market, hedge funds and private equity funds, and the ratings agencies. Voluntary codes of good conduct have been a dismal failure. We urgently need globally applicable regulatory minimum standards similar to those, say, within the WTO. </p> <p>We need a democratically legitimised world finance organisation, equipped with the necessary regulatory instruments, which would supervise major global financial institutions. This organisation should also have authority to create conditions for greater transparency, and to implement better early warning systems and instruments for crisis management. </p> <p>The newly created regulation need not apply to everyone. But only those financial institutions that subject themselves to these rules would be able to rely on the support of the public authorities in case of a crisis. This would ensure both fiscal stability and fiscal innovation \u2013 in contrast to the present situation, in which no one obeyed any rules and, when crisis erupted, taxpayers had to come to the rescue. </p> <p>Second, welfare state institutions should be strengthened. The crisis has made clear that the provision of people's elementary needs must not be made dependent on speculation and stock market curves. Expansion of public financing for pensions, nursing care, and health insurance is therefore crucial. </p> <p>Finally, we need a European economic stimulus program \u2013 a Big Bargain \u2013 and we need it now. The crisis in international financial markets has had a noticeable impact on Europe's real economy. Some large EU countries are on the brink of recession. Japan in the early 1990s waited too long to act and missed the right opportunity to enact countermeasures, which is why Japan has still not recovered from its long stagnation. </p> <p>Public investment in infrastructure (such as a massive expansion of the European railroad network), as well as climate protection and environmental technology, will be needed. To strengthen purchasing power and to stimulate consumption, tax cuts on low- and medium-income households are essential. </p> <p>Of course, EU member states should determine the concrete form that such economic stabilisation programs take for themselves. But that shouldn't stop European governments from working together closely. To be effective, any stimulus program will need Europe's nations to act in concert. </p> <p><em>Alfred Gusenbauer is the Federal Chancellor of Austria. </em></p> <p><em>Copyright: Project Syndicate/Institute for Human Sciences, 2008. <br><a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org/\">www.project-syndicate.org</a></em></p>",
  "<p>Somewhere along the road between the start of his campaign to become London mayor and his post-victory visit to Whiteleys shopping arcade, a backseat voice whispered in Boris Johnson's ear. The future mayor had been <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7188239.stm\">hinting</a> to voters on the affluent west side of town that the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/london/content/articles/2006/10/30/westernextention_feature.shtml\">extension of the congestion charge zone</a>, imposed on their territory against their wishes by Ken Livingstone last year, would be removed if he secured victory. But by the time he was <a href=\"http://davehill.typepad.com/london3ms/2008/07/western-extensi.html\">pressing the flesh</a> in Queensway his stance had become more flexible. The promised consultation on the future of the scheme would now offer more than a straightforward choice between retention and abolition. There would be a third way too; a middle way; an <a href=\"http://www.tfl.gov.uk/tfl/roadusers/congestioncharging/westernextension/options.aspx#option-three\">\"option three\"</a>. </p> <p>Who was that backseat driver? What directions were conveyed? What does option three mean politically? Anti-Ken ultras regard Johnson's shifting as shiftiness, preparing the ground for a great betrayal. Rather than righting a centrally imposed and therefore emblematic Livingstone wrong Johnson has, they think, been persuaded from the path of righteousness by devious Transport for London Kenites. </p> <p>More plausibly, the London assembly's Lib Dems believe the The Blond's nuancing shows that his localism lacks conviction. They say the extension has harmed business and market traders \u2013 notably in Portobello Road \u2013 and actually added to central London congestion overall because a generous discount scheme means those smart westerners have seized the opportunity to drive in both parts of C-charge zone for a value-for-money fee. </p> <p>Meanwhile, supporters of the extension are keeping mum. Perhaps they've been heartened by Johnson's seeming to let slip before a <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/7592859.stm\">BBC camera</a> a preference for option three, which could introduce payment on account, a free period in the middle of the day or increase residents' discount to 100%. For pro C-chargers, the latter represent far less bad outcomes than they'd feared. </p> <p>My bet is that we will indeed end up with one of the two forms of option three, though I wouldn't stake my car on it. Londoners' wishes are to be gauged not only with reference to a new consultation but also to scientific polling of 2,000 Londoners and 1,000 businesses. Should these data howl a resounding \"no\", Johnson would be hard put to contradict it. Yet the indications are that many locals have indeed warmed to the charge, and their views will carry weight. If the extension stays, albeit in adapted form, the mayor's critics will cry fudge and fix. Would they have a point?</p> <p>It's arguable. The Blond's abolitionist hints were heavy. But though his transport manifesto \u2013 no longer accessible online, as it ought to be \u2013 pledged to abide by the result of a new consultation, it didn't say what the consultation would comprise. Johnson also made general noises about \"listening to Londoners\". In view of what he's learned about the climate of opinion he can, at a stretch, claim that option three means he's been able to hear them more clearly. </p> <p>Of itself, that is desirable. The arguments are finely-balanced. Vehicle congestion and air quality in the extension area seem not to have improved, but that doesn't mean none of its goals have been achieved. No one disputes that 30,000 fewer vehicles now enter that part of the zone each day, meaning that both congestion and engine emissions would increase if it went. So would road conditions for pedestrians, buses and cyclists. Against this must be considered retailers' loss of trade, a situation they fear will worsen thanks to a large new shopping centre just outside the zone in Shepherd's Bush. Why, they ask, would people pay \u00a38 to shop with them inside the zone instead?</p> <p>Then there are the economics. Johnson is pressing ahead with other pro-motorist measures \u2013 which he claims are pro-environment too \u2013 including the re-phasing of traffic lights and reconsideration of the planned removal of a busy roundabout at Elephant and Castle which is part of a major regeneration. But losing the western extension would lose him income: <a href=\"http://www.tfl.gov.uk/tfl/roadusers/congestioncharging/westernextension/pdf/western-extension-supplementary-information.pdf\">TfL says (pdf)</a> \u00a370m a year. Even half that amount would be significant to an administration committed to \"value-for-money\".</p> <p>It's an untidy situation and politically tricky. Fed-up fans and foes alike suspect he's bottling out, but I reckon it's just the latest case of Boris coming to terms with the complex compromises of office. That is the true meaning of option three.</p>",
  "<p>As the growing season starts in Bolivia, thousands of families are struggling to cope with droughts in five of nine regions. The lack of water threatens to destroy a significant part of this year's staple cereal crop, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinoa\">quinoa</a>. </p> <p>Some farmers have begun growing drought-resistant crops, like Brazil nuts, to adapt to this change in climate. (Bolivia now exports 75% of the world's Brazil nuts, compared to just 20% from Brazil.) These efforts have been painfully slow, however, because they require not only fresh investment, but also expensive research to determine which parts of the country will be most vulnerable to droughts \u2013 and flooding. In other words, knowing what to prepare for, when to do it and where. </p> <p>It is worth pointing out that Bolivia as a nation is responsible for less than 0.1% of the global emissions of carbon dioxide. This is mainly because it is the poorest country in South America and relatively under-developed as a result.</p> <p>Clearly, to pull itself out of poverty, Bolivia needs to develop. The challenge will be to implement a development strategy that takes carbon emissions into account. I am a climate change adviser for <a href=\"http://www.cipca.org.bo/\">CIPCA</a>, which works with indigenous farmers around the country to help them improve their yields and adapt to climate change. In the UK, we receive support from<a href=\"http://www.christianaid.org.uk/\">Christian Aid</a>, which is lobbying heavily in Europe for tighter controls on emissions.</p> <p>It is good news that the British government yesterday pledged to cut UK emissions by 80% by 2050. But it is also important that the EU agrees to a strong target \u2013 at least the 30% cut by 2020 currently being discussed. I have come to London to take part in Christian Aid's <a href=\"http://www.christianaid.org.uk/ActNow/Countdown-to-Copenhagen-climate-change/Index.aspx\">Countdown to Copenhagen</a> campaign to lobby the British government to push for a fair climate deal at the UN summit in Copenhagen in December next year.</p> <p>In Bolivia, there is a growing political awareness that we too need to develop in an environment-friendly way. Nonetheless, there is also recognition that no development is entirely free of environmental consequences. Bolivia is already feeling the consequences of other countries' carbon-heavy development, and many feel that it should not be doubly jeopardized by having its own development unduly constrained by environmental concerns.</p> <p>An idea which is gaining currency is the <a href=\"http://www.christianaid.org.uk/ActNow/Countdown-to-Copenhagen-climate-change/Index.aspx\">Greenhouse Development Rights Framework</a>, which basically argues that countries must cut their emissions and pay for adaptation measures in relation to the amount they have emitted in the past. In other words, Bolivia has less responsibility for creating the problem, so it should receive more help in solving it.</p> <p>Bolivia, at the heart of the South American continent is a country with a comparatively substantial proportion of its population \u2013 around 40% -\u2013 still living in rural areas and depending mainly on traditional small-scale farming activities. This, along with a poor development of its economy and extremely high income inequalities (partly as a result of decades of having applied the IMF and World Bank liberalisation policies) has contributed to a high degree of vulnerability in the country as a whole. In La Paz, for example, scientists fear that the accelerated melting of the Andean ice caps will mean that there is not enough water to supply the city by 2009. The only way to combat this is to build large reservoirs to capture water in the rainy season for use in the dry season. But this costs money, which the government does not currently have.</p> <p>The great challenges ahead for Bolivia will be skilfully managing its key natural resources \u2013 its huge reserves of natural gas, in particular \u2013 and reinvesting the revenues in improving basic services such as health care, education and public infrastructure. Bolivia has the potential to lead the way in redefining the concept and paradigm of development. </p> <p>Unfortunately political unrest over constitutional reform threatens to derail this process. The moneyed elite in the eastern lowlands are pressing for greater autonomy after the government announced it will redistribute land and petroleum royalties to the country's indigenous majority.</p> <p>Last month, tensions over the constitution erupted into violence with 30 people killed in the northern province of Pando. I hope this conflict is not allowed to scupper Bolivia's development.</p>",
  "<p>It might seem an odd time to be leaving <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour\">the Labour party</a>; after a decade of courting the City, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/gordonbrown\">Gordon Brown</a> is nationalising banks, and promising to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/14/gordonbrown-foreignpolicy\">get tough with global capitalism</a> (not to mention Iceland). Our first chance in a decade to alter the ideological landscape of British politics. If I tolerated <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq\">Iraq</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/cashforhonours\">cash for honours</a>, and <a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/person/0,,-3623,00.html\">Alan Milburn</a>, then why quit now? </p> <p>The thing is, while the fundamentals of the world economy transform around us, the fundamentals of the Labour party remain unchanged. </p> <p>I'm leaving the Labour party because its internal culture has decayed to such an extent that \u2013 to borrow a term adored by New Labour \u2013 it no longer has the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2001/apr/01/voluntarysector.comment\">social capital</a> necessary to function in its core marketplace. There is a revolt going on in Labour's backyard, demonstrated in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/glasgoweast\">recent byelections</a>, and it doesn't even realise it. The party's inner life is, at best, introverted, and at worst, boring. Beyond the perks of being in power, membership of the Labour party today has very little value.<br> The simple truth is that the Labour party is rotting. Some members have stayed purely out of habit. They aren't really that interested in politics, at least not any more, but they have no place else to go. Most, however, are interested primarily in their career prospects. Everybody seems to have a position, some rung on the ladder. And they talk to each other like workers talk to managers and like managers talk to executives in any large organisation. Yet given that so few will end up in positions of genuine influence, I couldn't logically explain why anyone joins the party any more.  Neither camp can be entrusted with the vital task of providing links between the Labour party and its traditional supporters, or society in general. They don't even have the inclination. Working out what society wants is what focus groups are for. It goes almost without saying that most members of the Labour party today wouldn't know what to say to the poor even if they knew how to find them. </p> <p>By accident or design, Labour has virtually ceased to function outside the formal processes of representative democracy. Local parties work tirelessly on local election campaigns. They work, a little less tirelessly perhaps, on general election campaigns. But they no longer have the capacity to make their presence felt in the day-to-day life of Labour's heartlands.</p> <p>I am not talking about the party's <a href=\"http://www.annblack.com/partnership_made_easy.htm\">policy-making procedures</a>. After 18 years in opposition a little discipline was necessary. But Labour members are now self-disciplining. Despite what the media thinks, most members are too busy arranging the deckchairs to care whether it's Gordon Brown or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidmiliband\">David Miliband</a> or <a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/person/0,,-6347,00.html\">Jon Cruddas</a> at the helm.</p> <p>I remember bumping into fellow members around the time of the leadership election, and asking who they were supporting for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labourdeputy\">deputy</a>. I was surprised by almost all of their answers \u2013 only then did I realise that despite, in some cases, many years of friendship, I had little idea of what my comrades thought about politics. People seldom express opinions in the Labour party. We can't be bothered to argue with each other any more. Nationalising the banks, anyone? We are in the middle of the most momentous, and fascinating, transformations in the history of capitalism. The boundaries between state and market are being redefined as we speak. But the problem is that the Labour party isn't speaking.</p> <p>Some party members still like to think of themselves as leftwing, but they've spent so long defining themselves against the rest of the left they don't know what they actually believe. Do we like this banks thing or not? What do we say to our friends and colleagues outside the party about it? The crucial and largely informal mechanisms by which a party deliberates with its constituencies have entirely dried up for Labour.</p> <p>I'm not simply deserting a sinking ship. As implausible as it seemed a month ago, Gordon Brown might even win the next election. But with a party in decay the government's long-term development is rudderless. So nationalise, baby, nationalise: the damage is already done.</p>",
  "<p>There's a mood of anxious euphoria among <a href=\"http://www.snp.org/\">Scottish National Party</a> <br>supporters as they make their way to Perth for their annual <br>conference this weekend. Triumphalism at the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/glasgoweast\">Glasgow East byelection</a> victory has been laced with concern that the economic landscape has changed out of all recognition since July. Yesterday, the Irish government introduced an austerity package of tax increases that underlined the extent to which the Celtic Tiger economy, which the SNP has always held up as the model for an independent Scotland, is not what it was. </p> <p>Mind you, neither is the UK economy. Austerity is likely to be <br>the name of the game in Britain too now that the public accounts have been shredded by the banking bail-out. Ireland has a fiscal <br>deficit of 6.5%, double the Maastricht limit, and Britain is heading <br>exactly the same way. The immediate presentational problem remains with the SNP, however, since the predominantly unionist Scottish press has been <a href=\"http://news.scotsman.com/opinion/Why-global-crisis-has-left.4602208.jp\">quick to point</a> to Ireland and Iceland as salutary lessons in the folly of separatism. What Alex Salmond has to do this weekend is persuade Scots that an independent Scotland would not end up like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/commentisfree+world/iceland\">Iceland</a> \u2013 bankrupt, alone and waving the begging bowl at Russia.</p> <p>Actually, there's a lot of residual sympathy in Perth for the <br>Icelanders, a rugged, independently minded people used to adversity. <br>Questions are being raised, and will be raised further as the weekend <br>progresses, about the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/10/iceland-gordonbrown\">heavy-handed way</a> the UK handled the Iceland default, employing anti-terrorist legislation to seize banking assets. There is a suspicion that Gordon Brown may have been hoping to make an example of Iceland \"pour encourager les autres\".</p> <p>Over the weekend, SNP leaders intend to come out fighting on <br>behalf of all the small northern European countries that the Labour <br>Scottish secretary Jim Murphy has labelled the \"arc of insolvency\". He will be accused of insulting Scotland's neighbours, and failing to <br>note how Norway's \u00a3200bn oil fund has functioned as an economic <br>stabiliser. The SNP has called for a similar oil fund in Scotland. <br>Not that it would be worth quite as much as a few months ago. The <br>collapse in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/oil\">price of oil</a> to less than $70 a barrel blows another hole in the Scottish accounts, according to Labour.</p> <p>Some nationalists could be forgiven for consoling themselves with traditional Scottish fatalism. Just our luck, they'll be saying over a dram. Scotland finally elects a nationalist government, wins huge public support, and what happens? The greatest financial crisis in 80 years. You couldn't make it up.</p>"
