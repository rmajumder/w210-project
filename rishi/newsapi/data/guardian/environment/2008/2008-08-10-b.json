  "<p>Britain could create the \"glue\" to reunite a divided society and set out its future aspirations by embracing a bill of rights which goes much further than existing rights to embrace positive social and economic freedoms, a group of MPs and peers told ministers yesterday.</p> <p>\"A UK bill of rights and freedoms would be a constitutional landmark. It would provide a framework both for protecting the liberty of the individual against the intrusion of state power, and for protecting the 'little person' against powerful interests,\" the committee's chairman, Andrew Dismore MP, explained yesterday.</p> <p>Such a move could open up the gradual prospect of individuals - especially the \"vulnerable and marginalised\" - being able to go to court to enforce the right to decent housing, healthcare or education for a child with special needs. </p> <p>It might also prevent failed asylum seekers being denied benefits as is currently official policy, the joint Lords-Commons committee on human rights (JCHR) says in a new report. Such changes might help offset \"the popular misconception that human rights are a charter for criminals and terrorism\".</p> <p>The committee, chaired by Labour's Dismore, is aware of the political sensitivities involved. Any proposal that might give greater power to courts to allocate public resources - money or services - would be seen as infringing the prerogative of elected ministers and MPs. So the JCHR's remedy would allow court rulings to be merely influenced by a new \"underpinning\" of human rights - rather than create \"directly enforceable duties,\" the report explains.</p> <p>The committee, which monitors a range of human rights issues, opposes suggestions that right should be conditional on good behaviour, though it does propose inclusion of \"civic duty\" to fellow citizens.</p> <p>It also rejects ministerial suggestions that the bill of rights ideas now being discussed within Gordon Brown's government - a process being led by Jack Straw, the justice minister - should be called a British bill of rights. So as to include Northern Ireland it should be a UK bill of rights and freedoms.</p> <p>But the scope envisaged by the JCHR would embrace new areas of international human rights and contain the specific guarantee of the right to asylum. It would also include the right to \"a healthy and sustainable environment\" - the kind of aspiration that might tilt a court ruling more positively in that direction.</p> <p>Historically, rights have been largely focused on the legal and political kind that include freedom of speech, access to justice and the ballot box - as well as \"negative freedoms\" such as those from arbitrary arrest and imprisonment or religious persecution. The Dismore committee wants the government - or an incoming Tory government, which has also promised a bill of rights - to build on \"positive freedoms\" of the kind first expounded by the US president Franklin Roosevelt as part of his Four Freedoms in 1941.</p>",
  "<p>As if they were not busy enough striving for trophies, the top four have to deliver major stories as well. At least Chelsea put their heart and soul into the mission and never shy away from melodrama. Luiz Felipe Scolari is the third person in under a year to be Stamford Bridge manager so it is as well that he is the master of acclimatisation, having been in charge of clubs in Brazil, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Japan.</p> <p>Scolari has done well enough to enjoy a permanent place among the elite in his profession. Nobody pulls rank on someone who has won the World Cup. His standing was unharmed as manager of Portugal when there was a curious tolerance of the team's defeats, as hosts, to Greece in the games that opened and closed Euro 2004. Overall, Scolari has no apologies to make for his CV.</p> <p>For all the rhetoric about the ravishing football supposedly insisted upon by Chelsea's owner, Roman Abramovich, there has always been beauty enough for Scolari in winning ugly. It was only the critics who winced when his Gremio side, with its roughhouse habits, took the Copa Libertadores in 1995. Scolari is not dissimilar to Jose Mourinho and Chelsea fans will be cheered if he is better at tending the relationship with the owner.</p> <p>His problem lies in the fact that Chelsea are a less composed side now after being runners-up to Manchester United in successive campaigns. Losing the Champions League final to them was a further dose of misery. Sir Alex Ferguson's hurtful musings about Chelsea's prospects led to some totting up of the ages of the respective squads at Old Trafford and Stamford Bridge, but his real insinuation was that Scolari's group had slender scope for development.</p> <p>At trophyless Chelsea, the Brazilian will have to work hard to convince his players that they are really capable of regaining domination of English football. Ferguson's assignment is the converse of that. He is the only manager to have won the Premier League title in three consecutive seasons and now has to remember quite how he preserved the freshness. The difficulty is exacerbated because surgery has ruled Cristiano Ronaldo out of the start of the programme, even if United could be scornful about Real Madrid's efforts to whisk him away forever.</p> <p>Longevity of achievement comes when there are additional figures ready to dominate. It would have been folly to assume that Ronaldo would offer as much for a second year in a row even if he were utterly committed to United and totally fit. Eyes were bound to settle on Wayne Rooney, who has been a paragon of industry and humility.</p> <p>Some, surely including Ferguson, still wish for echoes of the explosive self-confidence he had as a youth at, for example, Euro 2004. The manager was happy to muse recently on the importance of finding a role that really suits Rooney. It is an exercise whose outcome will also matter to Fabio Capello as England settle down to World Cup qualifiers.</p> <p>Premier League rivals would prefer the low-profile Rooney since life is already hard enough without him on the rampage. The strain is felt almost everywhere. Even if the top four is viewed as a league apart, its bottom two clubs, Arsenal and Liverpool, might wince at the notion of being relegated from it. </p> <p>Ars\u00e8ne Wenger has had a lot to reckon with and while he is not the type to rail against his employers, the need to pay off the Emirates Stadium has its impact on the wages or transfer fees that can be agreed. Morale, for all that, may be improved by an opening stretch of amenable fixtures. The club's usual low-key build-up to the season could also be an advantage since they have avoided the debilitating travels of United and Chelsea, who seemed on a global treasure hunt in July, looking for long-term marketing income.</p> <p>Liverpool met a high price when agreeing to pay Tottenham \u00a320.3m for Robbie Keane, but the extra power in attack, and the option of switching from 4-2-3-1 to a gung-ho 4-4-2 against the weaker sides, with the Irishman pushed up from a deeper role to partner Fernando Torres, might save the club from drawing over a third of their League matches, as they did last season. It remains to be seen if new full-backs will endow Liverpool with the deftness which is sometimes lacking on their flanks.</p> <p>They cannot afford miscalculations. Everton, despite limited means, came fifth last year and several others see themselves surging nearer the top. Portsmouth, with Peter Crouch to partner Jermain Defoe in attack, are on the move. Aston Villa, too, could rise although expanding the squad has been a demanding project. There is the same craving for progress at West Ham and at Fulham, where the outlay has been eye-catching this summer. Roy Keane, with Sunderland, committed himself to a recruitment spree. </p> <p>Tottenham were also in the mood to galvanise themselves from the moment they concluded that the Croatian midfielder Luka Modric's energy and skill would compensate for his lack of heft. Exciting as Juande Ramos's retooled line-up should be, the solidity of the defence is crucial and there will be relief if Ledley King's troublesome knee allows him to appear regularly.</p> <p>The potential of Manchester City under the management of Mark Hughes, so long as he is in harmony with Thaksin Shinawatra, was made manifest in the \u00a318m purchase of the Brazilian striker Jo from CSKA Moscow. Hughes may have put himself on the side of the wealthy at just the right moment, stepping down at Blackburn as some important players there approached the final year of their contracts. Paul Ince, his successor at Ewood Park, will have excelled if he keeps the club stable.</p> <p>There are severe tests elsewhere and Kevin Keegan's circumstances at Newcastle are intriguing now that the owner, Mike Ashley, is being financially circumspect. With an imbalanced squad, the club may be prone to lurches. Middlesbrough, with a youngish group and an emphasis on speed, may be better placed to upgrade their status.</p> <p>Mere survival will ensure exultation for the newcomers: West Bromwich Albion, Stoke City and Hull City. Each of them must study the shrewdness in the market place that, over recent years, has so bolstered Wigan and Bolton. Then again, everyone in the Premier League other than Manchester United is in the scrambling quest for transformation.</p> <h2>Big four: How the new man compares</h2> <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson</strong></p> <p><strong>Stressbuster </strong><br>More than once a furiously chewed piece of Extra has prevented an apocalyptic meltdown on the Old Trafford touchline.</p> <p><strong>Drinks cabinet </strong><br>Once owned a pub in Govan, but in the prawn sandwich era has moved on to wine, which he buys and sells for profit.</p> <p><strong>Favourite word </strong><br>Youse. </p> <p><strong>Bete noir </strong><br>Pesky bloated footballing supergiants trying to tap up a club's best player.

  "<p>Professor Bob Watson's warning that Britain should prepare for global warming of four degrees should not lead to defeatism (Prepare for global temperature rise of 4C, warns top scientist, August 7); it should spur our government to do all they can to prevent it. </p> <p>If a four-degree rise is devastating for the UK, it would be a catastrophe in the world's poorest countries. The UK government must do all it can to secure a strong international climate deal at Copenhagen next year. It must also do the right thing at home. The government claims to be leading the way with its climate change bill, but the current target of 60% emissions cuts by 2050, if applied globally, would deliver a four-degree rise in temperature. Gordon Brown must be more ambitious.<br><strong>Paul Cook</strong><br>Advocacy director, Tearfund </p> <p>The call for the UK to brace itself for a global temperature rise of 4C highlights the contradictory nature of the UK's energy policy. The government now recognises that billions of pounds will need to be spent on staving off coastal erosion and making agriculture more resilient. Yet by backing a new generation of coal-fired power stations, the cabinet risks exacerbating the damage done. Expanding coal-fired power generation would be like eating a cheeseburger on a treadmill when you have a heart condition. The government must heed scientific experts and put the country on track for an 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.<br><strong>Julian Oram</strong><br>World Development Movement</p> <p>You suggest that the most significant impact on the UK would be flooding. Not so. The most significant impact would be the collapse of the world economy. Your leader (August 7) at least acknowledged the scale of the problem, though the suggestion that stabilising emissions at the present level would prevent catastrophic temperature rise is a misinterpretation of the science, which says we need drastic cuts now to give us a chance of staying near 2C. Given this state of affairs, why are we not taking to the streets and demanding that action is taken?<br><strong>Tony Hamilton </strong><br>The Campaign to Take Global Warming Seriously </p> <p>A 4C rise would make parts of Africa and South America uninhabitable. It would cause populations to move away from the equator on an unprecedented scale. Such changes will lead to starvation and disease on a huge scale - and wars. These horrors will have profound implications for international development and trade and foreign policy. </p> <p>Many refugees will seek the least affected, temperate, latitudes. Western Europe, Turkey, Russia, Chile, Argentina and India will all face major influxes of desperate people. This challenge will demand new approaches to foreign policy and international institutions.</p> <p>A four-degree rise would cut world food production substantially, leading to higher food prices and malnutrition. New policies on agriculture and trade will be needed. Truly, a four degree rise will transform the world.<br><strong>David Flint</strong><br>London </p> <p>Human and environmental poverty are linked global issues which cry out for equilibrium. George Monbiot is right about coal (The stakes could not be higher. Everything hinges on stopping coal, August 5) and Arthur Scargill is right about nuclear power (Coal isn't the climate enemy, Mr Monbiot. It's the solution, August 8). UK energy requirements can be met through renewables and efficiency. Developing economies, already committed to coal, need CCS technology as soon as we can develop it. And the UK needs to pursue a green economy with sustainable livelihoods at its heart.<br><strong>Robert Patrick</strong><br>Glasgow</p> <p>The discussion following George Monbiot's article illustrates that denial of global warming is still widespread. The scientific evidence is irrefutable that there is a large risk that we will cause widespread human suffering and irreversible destruction should we continue to emit large amounts of greenhouse gases. Denial of these risks is more than wishful thinking; it is avoiding responsibility, focusing attention on minor issues, and postponing action.</p> <p>The coal industry has a credibility problem because it has not yet built a single large-scale CCS demonstration plant. However, estimates suggest it represents one solution to electricity production, negating the need for new coal-fired power plants without CCS.</p> <p>Investors in coal-fired plants are well informed about the risks of climate change. They must, therefore, take the full financial risks of possible future shut-downs. As a society, we can ill afford to allocate resources to power plants that may have a very short lifetime.<br><strong>Jan Sunner</strong><br>University of Portsmouth</p> <p>Your enthusiasm for CCS and Scargill's support for new coal-fired power stations on the basis that they are CCS-ready merits significant caution. CCS remains an unproven technology. Energy efficiency is the most cost-effective means of reducing carbon emissions. There is a risk that placing our faith in the successful deployment of CCS could be used to justify many years of pollution while we sit back and hope the technology works.<br><strong>Adrian Wilkes</strong><br>Environmental Industries Commission </p> <p>Arthur Scargill's views on nuclear power are misguided. Compared to coal power, nuclear power is cleaner, safer and more efficient. The waste produced is a fraction of the amount produced by coal and can be stored safely in zeolites deep underground. Uranium-238, the main nuclear fuel, emits only alpha radiation which cannot penetrate the skin. I would happily sit in a room with it while Arthur Scargill gets to grips with his CO2.<br><strong>Ashley Ferrari</strong><br>Leeds</p>",
  "<p>High street banks, including Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC and Barclays, face a consumer boycott if they continue to channel billions of pounds of new investment into coal projects, campaigning groups warned last night.</p> <p>The warning came as 50 campaigners were arrested over the weekend at the climate camp set up to protest against building a new coal-fired power station at Kingsnorth in Kent. Clashes with police occurred at E.ON's site near Hoo in Kent over the weekend as climate campers dug in for a week of protests.</p> <p>In detailed estimates published in a report by a coalition of environmental groups, RBS is accused of helping to provide an estimated $16bn (\u00a38bn) to E.ON and other companies utilising coal over the past two years, with HSBC providing $10bn and Barclays $5.79bn. </p> <p>\"Coal is the dirtiest and most inefficient fossil fuel there is,\" said Duncan McLaren, chief executive of Friends of the Earth Scotland, which is part of the green coalition that published the report. </p> <p>\"RBS is providing the financial means for companies to build unabated coal-fired power stations and dig new coal mines all over the world, yet still refuses to disclose full information on the fossil fuel projects it helps finance or to take any responsibility for the emissions that result.</p> <p>\"People are coming from all over the country to protest against the proposed new coal-fired power station at Kingsnorth. If RBS and the other banks don't stop financing such climate-trashing projects they risk a similar public backlash.\"</p> <p>Kingsnorth is in the front line of a global dash for coal, with at least 100 coal projects on the blocks around the world, particularly in China, which opens the equivalent of two coal-fired stations a week.</p> <p>Environmental groups are looking to target banks that fund coal projects while trumpeting their own green credentials. The campaigners are particularly incensed by the fact many high street banks advertise themselves to students and other consumers as having a modern and positive attitude to green issues through energy efficiency and other measures. </p> <p>They point out that the Co-op Bank, by contrast, has introduced an ethical investment policy prohibiting it from financing any coal, oil or gas projects. </p> <p>Research for the report shows that RBS participated in 27 different loans to coal projects around the world between May 2006 and April 2008, while Barclays made 17 loans and HSBC was involved in three projects. The banks also play a role in acting as financial advisers to new projects and structuring the loans.</p> <p>The report calculates that, overall, British banks were involved in consortia responsible for $108bn of lending to coal projects worldwide in the two years to this April, although this does not represent banks' individual exposure.</p> <p>Banks are susceptible to consumer pressure for change, according to the report, which cites the high-profile boycott of Barclays in the 1980s over its financial involvement in apartheid-era South Africa. In 2006 HSBC acknowledged that its \"most significant impact [on climate change] is the investment and lending decisions we make\".</p> <p>Student unions at six British universities , including Leeds, Warwick and Edinburgh, have passed motions in support of the campaign and reiterated the warnings to banks that they must show they have changed their ways as early as next year or face the consequences, said Platform, another group involved in the coalition.</p> <p>Kevin Smith of Platform said its new report, Cashing in on Coal, was only a partial picture based on what information it could find. \"Banks have a duty to give the public a full disclosure about fossil-fuel financing so that account holders can choose whether they want their money to be used to support new coal projects like Kingsnorth power station,\" he said.</p> <p>A spokesperson for RBS defended the bank's corporate lending practices. \"We fund a balanced portfolio of generation assets. That covers a spectrum from being the biggest funder of renewable generation projects globally to also supporting the oil sector, which supports 300,000 jobs in the UK and our generation sector, on which the UK depends.\"</p> <p>The energy minister, Malcolm Wicks, justified pressing ahead with Kingsnorth as long as it was \"carbon capture ready\" in an interview with the Guardian last week. The as yet unproven technology of carbon capture storage is thought capable of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 90%.</p> <p>Wicks insisted that the stakes were high for developing clean coal tech nology. \"If we do not meet the challenge,\" he said, \"all is lost on global warming.\"</p> <h2>Backstory</h2> <p>Power producers are involved in a dash for coal because it is cheap and abundant. Gas and oil have soared in price and are being depleted more quickly than expected. According to a study by MIT, coal can provide usable energy at a cost of $1-2 (52p-\u00a31.04) per million British thermal units compared with $6-12 per MMBTU for oil and natural gas. Worldwide reserves of coal are also estimated to be enough to last for 150 years. However, in order to reduce carbon emissions, companies are looking to new, unproven technology.</p>",
  "<p>When Michael Grade replaced Charles Allen as the head of ITV, the sense of relief was almost tangible. Allen's approach - maintaining profitability by cost cutting and seeking regulatory relief in the face of declining on-air performance and difficult market conditions - seemed to have run out of road. What ITV needed was a creative leader and a strategy for the new, digital, multimedia world. And Grade certainly talked the talk, with a \"content-led\" growth strategy that would see global production and distribution revenues double to \u00a31.2bn. Half of that increase would come from filling more of ITV's schedule with in-house programming - up to the 75% maximum was the stated aim - which the company would then make hay with in global markets. Yes, ITV's traditional broadcasting business needed to combat falling reach and share, but the promised increases in production and online revenues were a reason for investors to see ITV as a good long-term bet. </p> <p>And yet, just 18 months on, last week's interim results had Michael Grade reading a script that could have been written for his predecessor. Having admitted that the ambitious targets in production and online were now not going to be met, he railed against an \"Antiques Roadshow of regulation\" from which he demanded immediate relief - as well as offering up a further \u00a335m a year of cost cuts to placate investors. Grade was able to point to significant improvement in ITV's on-air performance - better than its commercial competitors - but much of that has arisen from schedule alterations and plans developed under the old regime.</p> <p>So what is it about ITV that has turned Michael Grade into Charles Allen? Both men - although only Grade is noted for it - alighted on content as the key to corporate growth. ITV is essentially two businesses. The broadcasting side generates the lion's share of the revenues and 80% of the profits, but given the market conditions spawned by digital developments it cannot grow substantially. The content side is smaller but has in theory the capacity to grow. The problem is that, like Allen, Grade has not convinced investors that he knows how to make that happen, or is prepared to do what's necessary. </p> <p>If content is to be the source of long-term growth then there needs to be joined-up thinking between broadcasting and production - using ITV on air to create programming brands that can be exploited globally. This might mean favouring in-house productions over independent suppliers, and encouraging the content division to sell shows to broadcasting competitors. But both of these strategies might damage ITV's on-air performance in the short term - and neither Grade nor Allen have been prepared to go there for fear of frightening investors. What's more, on the evidence of last week's announcements, Grade's \"content-led\" growth strategy is not just moving slowly - it's going backwards. Production by ITV for its own network has fallen to an all-time low of 45%. </p> <p>So there you have it: network performance improving but in a market on the brink of a downturn, a growth strategy that's stuck and a share price that's dropped 65% since the current executive chairman took over. If what little shareholder confidence remains is to be retained, then short-term profitability must be the priority. And there's only two places that's going to come from - regulatory relief and cost-cutting. We even heard briefing to the effect that Michael Grade was the right man to lead ITV at this time on account of his close relationships in the corridors of power - so helpful when seeking regulatory relief. Sound familiar?</p>",
  "<p>A wave of a suicide bombings and police shootings left 11 people dead in western China yesterday, as Uighur Islamic separatists attempted to steal global attention from the Beijing Olympics.</p> <p>In what appears to be one of the most widely coordinated assaults in Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region in recent memory, the militants threw or carried homemade explosives into a dozen government sites in Kuqa city, killing a security guard, injuring two police officers, destroying two police cars and damaging trading and commerce offices.</p> <p>The separatists' most ambitious assault involved wheeling a tricycle laden with explosives into a public security bureau just before dawn. One attacker was shot, another blew himself up and two were captured, according to the state-run Xinhua news agency.</p> <p>Six hours later, police tracked down some of the alleged militants in the local marketplace. In the ensuing battle, two militants were reportedly shot and three blew themselves up with homemade bombs. One suspect is in detention. Another is in hospital, but at least six are thought to be at large. The entire Kuqa county, home to 400,000 people, has been cordoned off, business has been suspended, and paramilitaries with machine guns were patrolling the streets.</p> <p>The clashes came less than a week after Xinjiang witnessed the deadliest attack on Chinese security personnel in a decade. Last Monday, two alleged Muslim jihadists in Kashgar droved a lorry into a rank of jogging paramilitaries, then killed survivors with bombs and knives. The attack claimed 16 lives, and the authorities linked it to threats made earlier by three separatist groups who want to create an East Turkestan homeland for ethnic Muslim Uighurs in the region.</p> <p>On Thursday, the previously unknown Turkistan Islamic party released a video threat to attack buses, trains and airplanes during the Olympics.</p> <p>Kuqa is more than 1,850 miles from Beijing, but Olympic organisers have identified Uighur \"terrorists\" as the main threat to the games. Organisers sought to reassure athletes, journalists and tourists that yesterday's attack would not disrupt the sporting event. \"I do not believe this will have an impact on the Olympic games,\" Wang Wei, vice-president of the organising committee, told reporters.</p> <p>Exiled Uighur leader Rebiya Kadeer claimed that China is exaggerating the threat posed by separatist extremists as an excuse to impose its will on Xinjiang's the Muslim population and their peaceful campaign for more freedom. </p> <p>\"We advocate the principle of non-violence, and the promotion of freedom, democracy and human rights through peaceful means. We also sincerely hope for a peaceful Olympic games.\"</p> <p>She accused the Chinese authorities of a heavy handed crackdown in Kashgar and throughout East Turkestan in the name of the Olympics, saying that Uighurs have endured higher rates of execution and detention, forced relocation, police monitoring, passport confiscation, and the destruction of places of worship. Many Uighurs are unhappy that an influx of Han Chinese over the past 50 years has made them a minority in their homeland.</p> <p>Tibetan exile groups also continued to use the Beijing games to draw attention to what they say are human rights abuses in the Himalayan region.</p> <p>Five activists, including a Tibetan woman from Germany, Padma-Dolma Fielitz, were dragged from Tiananmen Square after displaying a Tibetan flag and a banner reading: \"Tibetans are dying for freedom\".</p> <p>The continuing unease among many Tibetan communities was highlighted by reports that two women were shot and wounded in Aba county town - the scene of some of the worst violence in March's wave of unrest. According to the Free Tibet Campaign, the shots came from a building that is being used as a Chinese barracks for military reinforcements sent into the area last month, apparently to ensure there are no protests during the Olympics.</p> <p>George Bush has used his visit to Beijing for last Friday's opening ceremony to raise the issue of religious freedom and improved human rights. Before meeting the Chinese president, Hu Jintao, and watching American swimmer Michael Phelps win gold in the 400-metre individual medley, the US president and his wife, Laura, attended a church service in Beijing to underline his message.</p> <p>\"You know, it just goes to show that God is universal, and God is love, and no state, man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion,\" he said, as parishioners exited the church.</p> <p>But the Chinese authorities remain concerned about extremist groups. More than 100,000 police and paramilitaries have been deployed in Beijing, along with 300,000 surveillance cameras in one of the biggest security operations mounted in China. They were unable, however, to prevent the apparently random murder on Saturday on the father-in-law of the US men's volleyball coach. </p> <p>Todd Bachman was stabbed to death, and his wife, Barbara, and a Chinese guide were seriously wounded in the attack at Beijing's 13th-century Drum Tower. The killer, Tang Yongming, leaped to his death after the attack. The motive remains a mystery. Tang - who recently retired from a job at a factory in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province - had arrived in Beijing on August 1. The 47-year-old, who divorced two years ago, had no criminal record.</p>",
  "<p>The best-selling action hero of the 21st century - Lee Child's ex-military cop Jack Reacher - has no home and no baggage. He roams the US via a succession of cheap motels, wearing the Primarky clothes he bought last week and will throw away next week. He couldn't care less about house prices. Houses just slow him down.</p> <p>Much the same, perhaps, might be said for the chief spokesman of Poles in Britain who, having caught the Daily Mail on the back foot, used its columns last week to note that as Poland's currency almost doubles against the pound there is suddenly \"more concern over departures than arrivals\".</p> <p>Mobility of labour is top of many wish lists. The single market in manpower that Brussels helped invent has become reality and feeds on itself. Bulgaria's labour minister recently announced visa quotas for Moldovan and Vietnamese workers brought in to do the sundry dirty jobs at home that 1.7 million Bulgarians have gone to Italy, Spain and the rest to do these past few years. Mobility is a global tide that never turns. So what on earth is this howl of house price angst about?</p> <p>The whole point about mobility is that it puts bricks and mortar on the periphery. Westward ho! the wagons. America's early prosperity was founded on road trips, trail drives and constant questing. Who wanted a little grey homestead to weigh them down?</p> <p>Yet that, in essence, is what the sub-prime crisis is all about. Mexicans, Guatemalans and Colombians move with the market; modern Americans put down roots and stick. And that, in turn, is where traditional British ambition becomes total confusion. </p> <p>Houses in Britain are too expensive - too few in a too crowded land, which guarantees riches from ownership once you get on the hallowed property ladder. So apparently governments must build hundreds of thousands extra a year to bring the price down - except, when it falls by an average 20 grand or more, that's disaster, and (in an early dose of dithering) stamp duties must somehow be waived to get the ladder rising again, thus ensuring a better (or fatter) life for those who can clamber aboard. </p> <p>It somehow becomes the state's job to make sure the carousel of expectation keeps turning. But as prices tumble and repossessions soar by 48%, the smug, snug days are over - and the home itself is a curse, not a blessing. Everyone, it seemed, could buy their own mini-castle - and sit back and see its value increase as though by magic. Everyone had the problem of inheritance tax pending as the rich list awaited.</p> <p>It was self-deluding. Fifteen years ago, as Spanish unemployment hovered near 20%, we guessed where the cracking point would come. It didn't, because those who had come to the city from the countryside simply went back again until things improved. </p> <p>Already, you can see parallel convulsions happening across Europe. President Sarkozy, who didn't want Polish plumbers, is letting them in. Bulgarians can go home to Sofia and send the Vietnamese back where they came from. It's a pragmatic, hardnosed, unlovable process.</p> <p>But we haven't shed our illusions. The headlines see ownership - and rising value - as a right. We assume that when Poles arrive here they'll stay, because that's what we would do in their place. And nobody wants precisely what a government that has sniffed the wind should be encouraging: thousands more cheap apartments for short-term lets, not sale, the underpinning of 21st-century flexibility. Relocation, relocation: this isn't a world of nests, illusions and desperate housewives any longer. It's a world where Jack Reacher and Kirstie Allsop head for the nearest motel.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:p.preston@theguardian.com\">p.preston@theguardian.com</a></p>",

  "<p>When Middlesbrough bought Dean Windass from Bradford City in 2001 the manager, Bryan Robson, made much of his new signing's bullish power and rugged frame. Unfortunately this was followed shortly afterwards by the news that the striker would miss several games after jarping his back lifting a bag out of the boot of his car.</p> <p>Seven years later and the Hull City forward is back in the Premier League, now at an age when experience will have taught him to approach such domestic tasks with a deal more circumspection. Windass is entering a period of life when most men have started to eye up comfort-fit slacks and abandoning any thought of ever again being able to look down and see their feet. If he makes it to April the forward will become only the fifth outfield player in the history of the English game to play in the top flight past his 40th birthday. </p> <p>The burly Humbersider may look as solid as a butcher's block and possess the face of Brian Glover's harder brother but even he is unlikely to break the record set by Sir Stanley Matthews. The great winger played his last game for Stoke City in 1965 at the tender age of 50 years and five days, calling to mind the great US basketball coach Wimp Sanderson's crack, \"I'm so old, when I started out the Dead Sea wasn't even sick.\"</p> <p>Nor does it seem likely that Windass will surpass Manchester City's Billy Meredith, who turned out at Maine Road in 1924 when well on his way to his 50th birthday. However, should he avoid doing himself further bag-related mischief, the Hull veteran may yet overtake two oldsters of more recent vintage, Gordon Strachan (40 years and 83 days for Coventry City in 1997) and Teddy Sheringham (40 years and 270 days for West Ham United in 2006).</p> <p>Thanks to better medical treatment, training methods and rule changes that now confine \"reducer\" tackles to after-dinner speaker circuit anecdotes of life with Terry Hurlock, the chances of players going on till well past the point when they are having to tell their team-mates that actually it's the Ting Tings who sound like Blondie not vice versa are greatly increased. In football the average age of spectators has risen and so has the average age of the players, with few Premier League dressing rooms these days lacking the influence of blokes who can remember when football was still a contact sport and aren't afraid to mention it at least once a day. Nevertheless it takes a special type of man to cross into his fifth decade while still wearing shorts to do his day job.</p> <p>A tough upbringing seems to be one factor. The majority of these long serving footballers experienced hardship during their lives. Windass did shifts in the Birds Eye frozen pea factory. Meredith worked down a coal mine. Matthews grew up during the Depression. Strachan once went to the pub with Paul McGrath, Bryan Robson and Norman Whiteside (the fearsome trio took him home afterwards in the boot of the car), while Sheringham had to put up with being called \"Edward\" by Brian Clough. </p> <p>Diet is also a factor. Matthews was said never to eat an ounce of fat while Strachan existed on an eccentric diet of porridge, bananas and seaweed. Asked if the seaweed made him fitter he replied: \"It made me swim faster.\" John Burridge, one of half-a-dozen goalkeepers who have played in the top flight in their forties, was another veteran who took a fastidious approach to food, rejecting the traditional 1970s player staples of steak and chips in favour of boiled rice, steamed fish and vegetables. </p> <p>Fruit also played a big part in the life of the much-travelled Budgie, apples and oranges were less a foodstuff than a training aid. As a former Aston Villa team-mate Andy Gray recalls of their time sharing a house together: \"On Friday nights Budge would come down into the sitting room wearing his goalkeeping gloves and sit down on the sofa in front of the TV. My job was to test his reflexes by hurling bits of fruit at him when he least expected it.\"</p> <p>Windass has his own exercise and fitness regime designed for him by his wife Helen, a Humberside policewoman. Matthews ran up and down sand dunes. Peter Shilton - another post-40 'keeper - focused on bodybuilding using a lethal, spring-loaded device called a bullworker, which could be bought at most sports shops in the 1970s and was probably responsible for loosening the teeth of more adolescent boys of the babyboomer generation than Cresta soda and Curlywurly bars. When not catching satsumas and palming away pears, Burridge used to hang from the banister by his feet.</p> <p>As this suggests eccentricity may also aid longevity. Meredith - nicknamed \"Old Skinny\" - played with a toothpick in his mouth. The toothpick was actually not his first choice. When he started playing for City he used to chew tobacco during matches but the kit man complained about the brown marks his nicotine-stained spittle made on the shirts and he was ordered to cut it out. </p> <p>The Welsh Wizard was a firebrand who founded one of the first players' trade unions. Windass has displayed no interest in labour organisation but he does like the music of Paul Weller and has displayed a distinct unwillingness to kowtow to the authorities, picking up three red cards in a single game when playing for Aberdeen and two years ago earning a five-match ban for shouting abuse at referee Darren Drysdale in the Valley Parade car park.</p> <p>As the old Chinese proverb has it, \"Before thirty, a man seeks injury; after thirty, injury seeks him.\" However fit they are and no matter what they eat and drink the older player is going to have to face life with a body that creaks and wheezes like a broken harmonium. Aches and strains are commonplace for the ageing footballer. Recounting his final years of ice packs and heat treatments Strachan would note: \"My bum has been through every temperature known to man.\" </p> <p>He may lack pace and it may sound as if he's making popcorn whenever he gets out of a chair but a veteran brings experience and wisdom to his team. \"It's not nice to get old but it's nice to ripen,\" Brigitte Bardot once remarked. As he puts his favourite track \"A Town Called Malice\" on the dressing-room stereo and has to explain to his team-mates once again who Mrs Thatcher was, Dean Windass will surely know what the French sex kitten meant.</p>",
  "<p>Bradford &amp; Bingley this morning begins a critical final week for its tortuous rights issue, having reached the home straight with shareholder support for the vital cash call still hanging in the balance.</p> <p>Shares in the mortgage bank languished close to the 55p issue price for almost two months and executive chairman Rod Kent is preparing for support from City and private investors to be thin when the rights issue closes on Friday at 11am.</p> <p>Only 8% of shareholders took up their rights last month in a deeply discounted \u00a34bn cash call by B&amp;B's much larger rival HBOS. Kent is expected to use this as a benchmark, claiming any level of acceptance greater than 8% would be an outstanding result. </p> <p>This would leave the vast majority of the new shares in the hands of sub-underwriters to the rights issue. These include six high street banks - Abbey, HBOS, HSBC, Lloyds TSB, Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays - which between them have guaranteed more than half of the \u00a3400m being raised by B&amp;B. Four institutional shareholders - Legal &amp; General, Standard Life, Prudential's M&amp;G and HBOS's Insight - have also pledged to take a portion of any unwanted rump.</p> <p>One of the most eventful capital raisings in British corporate history, B&amp;B's rights issue has been on the brink of collapse on at least three occasions, but each time has been righted by the increasingly resourceful Kent. The issue has had to weather a profits warning, the shock departure of a chief executive through ill health, a damaging credit-rating downgrade, a desertion by investors and a shareholder rebellion.</p> <p>Last Friday shares closed down fractionally at 54p. They have been changing hands at around the rights issue price of 55p since early June and would need to climb sharply this week for undecided B&amp;B shareholders to be galvanised into taking up their rights.</p> <p>More than a third of investors at the bank are small shareholders - a legacy of its previous incarnation as a building society - who are not expected to take up their rights unless they perceive substantial value in the new shares over and above those already trading on the stock exchange. Small shareholders held 27% of equity at HBOS before its rights issue and their lack of interest left a large hole in the fundraising.</p> <p>The strain that rescue rights issues from B&amp;B, HBOS and other banks have suffered this year has prompted calls from many institutional investors for a radical reform to the capital-raising process. Critics claim the protracted timescale of a UK cash call is no longer appropriate in modern, fast-moving markets.</p> <p>The trading environment for all British mortgage banks has worsened markedly over the period of B&amp;B's rights issue. In June, terms for the cash call had to be hastily redrawn after the mortgage bank issued a profits warning, citing a sharp rise in the level of loan repayments in arrears. </p> <p>Northern Rock, Alliance &amp; Leicester and HBOS have all since posted figures showing a rising trend of arrears across the mortgage market for the first half of 2008, with little sign of it abating. These updates will only heighten investor fears about the health of B&amp;B's mortgage book. </p> <p>The appetite for financial stocks may also have been hit after a humbling week for the banking sector, during which a parade of management teams unveiled plunging profits. </p> <p>B&amp;B, which had been due to post its half-year figures - including an arrears update - last week, has delayed reporting results until August 29, well after the closure of its rights issue.</p>",
  "<p>Traders are braced for heavy falls in oil and commodity prices this week, heralding the end of the so-called commodities boom, after the US dollar posted its biggest one-day gain against the euro for eight years on Friday.</p> <p>Analysts said the spread of economic contagion beyond the US has reduced demand expectations for commodities and interest rate forecasts, especially for the eurozone, which makes other currencies less attractive against the dollar.</p> <p>Last week's comments from Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the European Central Bank, that third-quarter growth in the eurozone will be \"particularly weak\" was taken to mean interest rates will be held or even reduced. That would narrow the gap between interest rates in the US and Europe, which helped fuel the dollar's decline.</p> <p>The euro suffered its biggest one-day drop since December 2000 on Friday, falling below $1.50 at one point . The euro has lost 10 cents in the past few weeks.</p> <p>Against the pound, meanwhile, the dollar pulled back to just under $1.92, its strongest performance since November 2006. Currency traders will be watching this week's economic data in the UK for further signs of weakness and the potential for rate cuts. Weakness in the Japanese economy also saw the dollar strengthen against the yen.</p> <p>The dollar's strength has been boosted by declines in the oil price on expectations that the weakening global economy will see demand fall, with traders switching their funds out of oil futures and into the foreign exchange market. Oil has declined 21% from its early-July peak of $147.27 a barrel. The weakness in the oil market also helped US shares on Friday with the Dow Jones Industrial Average shooting up more than 300 points.</p> <p>Investment bank Lehman Brothers said last week that oil prices have peaked for the next few years as supplies increase and demand drops. China, for instance, has ended its inventory building ahead of the Olympics while Saudi Arabia has upped supplies.</p> <p>The investment bank said in a note to clients: \"In our view, the recent correction in oil prices was overdue and softness awaits in the next 12 months.\"</p> <p>Speculators have been abandoning oil and those who remain in the market are taking short positions, according to traders, betting that the crude price has further to fall.</p> <p>Paradoxically, the strengthening dollar is likely to exacerbate traders' desire to get out of other commodities even though they are priced in the US currency, so on the face of it should rise in value.</p> <p>Many commodity speculators, whom some economists blame for keeping prices high, have been pulling out of the market in recent weeks as it has become more obvious that the global economy is cooling and therefore demand will tail off and prices decline. Any short-term support in commodity prices provided by the strong dollar will give them the chance to get out even faster, accelerating declines in the price of metals and soft commodities.</p> <p>The Jefferies-Reuters CRB index, which tracks commodities across the globe, plunged 10% last month, its biggest drop since 1980.</p>",
  "<p>Unusually for a high-flyer in the civil service, Sir David Serpell, who has died aged 96, made his public reputation after retiring. His Whitehall career over, Serpell made the front pages in 1983 as author of a controversial report on the sorry state of the British rail network.</p> <p>As an official in the Ministry of Transport, Serpell claimed (in a radio interview) to have persuaded Richard Beeching to become chairman of the British Railways Board in 1961. Serpell himself joined British Rail's board (1974-82) after retiring as a permanent secretary. That (incestuous) closeness between the ministry and the industry did not extend to the Treasury, where Serpell had served, or No 10, which never much liked trains. Indeed Serpell's career was not just bound up with the railways, it calibrated their decline. His \"hatchet job\" of a report was one of the last official expressions of anti-rail thinking. Serpell survived into a 21st century that prizes rail not as a problem, but the solution to environmental and economic problems.</p> <p>Nothing in Serpell's background prefigured a connection with the railways. He was born to an affluent West Country family, a link which haunted him when his rail report was published with maps showing no line surviving west of Exeter. His father was a solicitor in Plymouth who supported not just an undergraduate education, at Exeter College, Oxford, but several years of high-class roaming as an assistant at a Nazi-era school and a student at universities in France and the US, where he met his first wife, Anne Dooley, the daughter of a professor. They married in 1938 and were divorced in 1971.</p> <p>Bright enough to enter the civil service with ease on his return to the UK in 1937, Serpell moved on and up, establishing his career as wartime private secretary to Gwilym Lloyd George, the Independent Liberal who became minister of fuel, light and power in 1942. Blooded, as high flyers were (and still are) by a spell at the Treasury, beginning in 1945, he became a deputy secretary (now grade 2) at the Ministry of Transport in 1960 just as the prime minister, Harold Macmillan, was saying a rail network created in the 19th century had to adapt to a country where a third of families now owned a car. In 1963 Serpell was a member of an official committee on a tunnel under the Channel.</p> <p>With time out at the Board of Trade and the Treasury in the fraught months prior to sterling devaluation, Serpell became permanent secretary at transport in 1968, presiding, in 1970, over its merger into the portmanteau Department of the Environment. </p> <p>The former Labour MP Tam Dalyell has claimed that Serpell was uncomfortable about delivering Beeching's cuts because he was a believer in the environmental importance of railways. But it is difficult with any civil service career to attribute specific contributions by an individual to policy. Serpell was a Treasury official when a culture of under-investment in rail was engendered. Did he have anything personally to do with the introduction of breath-testing for motorists beyond issuing a circular to departmental officials telling them not to drink and drive? </p> <p>Even once papers are released under the 30-year rule, it is rare to find an individual mandarin's finger prints. This friend of Beeching had, earlier in the 1950s, negotiated terms for the supply of Iranian oil, only shortly before the deposition of the Tehran government with American help: conspiracy theorists start here.</p> <p>Whitehall has a way of looking after its own, and after his retirement in 1972, Serpell went on to chair a quango, the Nature Conservancy Council. In 1978, he was commissioned by Peter Shore, the Labour environment secretary, to conduct a review of Ordnance Survey. Worth re-reading in the light of modern arguments about the ownership of cartographic data, his report missed the boat when the incoming Thatcher government decided to make Ordnance Survey an arm's length body with commercial objectives.</p> <p>Personally, Serpell was regarded as a stickler for the rules - one of his senior colleagues said he was a martinet. Railways seize the imaginations of many, but Serpell was never accused of flights of fancy. Michael Heseltine, a junior environment minister who could be accused of many flights of fancy, blamed Serpell for trying to turn him into a training machine for callow graduate entrants to the civil service instead of furnishing his private office with experienced doers. But sometimes doers need to be fended off, for the sake of orderly and fair government. Serpell's protege at environment, Ian Bancroft, was sacked by Margaret Thatcher for not toeing the line.</p> <p>Serpell's reputation was damaged by his rail review. Sir Peter Parker, the then chairman of British Rail, had long wanted a strategic view of the network's future - he was after something Serpell said officials had sought for decades and never found: public objectives for the public transport system. The Thatcherites, especially special adviser Alan Walters, wanted to cut and privatise. The secretary of state, David Howell, stood haplessly in between. </p> <p>Serpell, though he had worked on an alternative investment strategy as a member of the BR board, was not the first choice as a review chair. (Amazingly, the Liberal leader David Steel had been considered.) Serpell offered a traditional civil service approach - the neutral presentation of options, however outlandish - which in the circumstances was inadequate. The membership of his panel was rigged; Howell prevaricated over how long-term it should be; British Rail, its survival and high public interest at stake, plotted and leaked. </p> <p>Commissioned in May 1982 in the midst of strikes, Serpell reported at Christmas. Before then and publication in late January 1983, the Guardian published juicy excerpts from a study envisaging (but not recommending) sawing off chunks from the national network. Serpell did not seem aware, or to care, that an options review in such political circumstances was never going to be the academic exercise his background and demeanour fitted him for. A cartoon in the Sunday Times showed Parker pulling the switch to send a Thomas-style locomotive with Serpell's face (he had a striking resemblance to Roy Jenkins) into the sidings. A botched privatisation aside, the subsequent history of British railways has been about increased demand, new construction and almost Victorian levels of optimism.</p> <p>Serpell, who was knighted in 1968, married his second wife, Doris Farr, in 1972. She died in 2004. He is survived by the three sons of his first marriage.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> David Radford Serpell, civil servant, born November 10 1911; died July 28 2008</p>",
  "<p>These are not sanguine times for American newspapers. \"Reductions in force\" (RIF) sweep through our cubicles like the Black Death. And, while this plague affects both national and provincial papers, it seems most dire at regional dailies such as my own, threatening publications' curtailment or extinction. </p> <p>I recently succumbed to the reaper's scythe at the Orlando Sentinel. The paper is part of the Tribune Company, owners of the Chicago Tribune (which last month shed 80 newsroom jobs), Los Angeles Times (150 newsroom jobs) and Baltimore Sun (55 newsroom jobs), among others. </p> <p>In the run-up to the latest round of cuts, the subject naturally consumed every discussion among my colleagues; there were hushed conversations in the corridors and rumour-laden emails flying between staffers. With near-unbearable stress, sleepless nights and rollercoaster emotions, the gloom was both palpable and inescapable. Despite everyone's best efforts, parties had a fin de si\u00e8cle feel.</p> <p><strong>Decision time </strong></p> <p>First came the redundancy offers. Journalists frantically calculated how long their severance packages would last before deciding whether to accept the company's offer (I declined). To complicate matters, top editors were deliberately vague about how many layoffs would follow the voluntary departures, and what the criteria for them would be. </p> <p>Employees had two scenarios - why they would and wouldn't get RIFed. I weighed it up: on the one hand, I was a target as I was at the upper end of the salary range; on the other, my beat - religion - was important to my Southern readers. Plus, I have a national profile, have won prizes and written three books.</p> <p>Backup \"Plan B\"s abounded. Everything from writing books and seeking university posts to more dire prospects, such as becoming a colourfully-vested Wal-Mart greeter. Our pop music critic joked, with gallows humour, that he could always return to his first job of decades ago: piloting Disney World's Jungle Cruise. </p> <p>At increasingly grim staff meetings in the newsroom, details emerged. We turned editors' percentage targets into hard numbers and, inevitably, began looking around the room. Finally, in order to provide a fig leaf of dignity, both the \"voluntaries\" and the \"involuntaries\" were called in one at a time to supervisors' glass-walled offices to receive the news. There were some surprises, some tears, and no official list was posted. </p> <p>Because I was headed for a vacation outside the country, I came in the week before to see my boss, and got the bad news face-to-face: I was out. Kicking me from the newspaper nest might turn out to be a good thing, I rationalised. I had my own Plan B firmly in place: to finally finish a book I have been working on for 13 years. But regardless of how well-prepared you think you are, the prospect of the job chop is one thing; the reality quite another. </p> <p>How - and why - have American newspapers come to such a death spiral? Nationally, every quarterly report shows significant drops in newspaper advertising sales and circulation - with no bottom in sight. Ink-on-newsprint is imploding at an accelerating rate; the only thing rising is our readers' average age. </p> <p>Despite a monopoly market, papers in the normally prosperous American Sunbelt have gone from double-digit annual returns to the precipice of profitability. Notwithstanding the Florida real estate market's dramatic downturn (exacerbated by the sub-prime mortgage crisis), the state's newspapers are still making money. In the case of Tribune dailies, it's just not enough to service the crushing debt load resulting from the highly-leveraged buyout that took the company private.</p> <p>The response has been to talk about transformation but then to default to traditional austerity measures, cutting thousands of newsroom jobs across the country. A Baltimore Sun writer observed recently that her social life seems to revolve around colleagues' leaving parties. Regional papers have jettisoned national and international coverage, except where strong local interest exists (Cuba and Israel in Miami; Ireland in Boston). We shrink paper size; experiment with \"alternative story forms\"; create frenetic redesigns. </p> <p>Our stories got shorter, simpler and more intensely local - always with a sharp eye toward how they would be illustrated, sometimes with heartbreaking results. Major stories can turn into \"charticles\". This is not why most of us got into this business. Does all this sound desperate? It gets worse. Some papers have changed the title of marketing directors to \"Innovation Officer,\" resulting in some cases in a barrage of high-octane memos that can read like manic, barely coherent musing.</p> <p><strong>Saturation point</strong></p> <p>In part, the fault is in the stars - which is to say, in the changes in culture which have produced such a media-saturated environment. But the fault is also in the newspapers being produced. Grown complacent - fat, dumb and happy - the industry became boring and irrelevant.</p> <p>The great minds that lead us missed two significant internet threats. Craigslist and eBay have gobbled up our classified advertising goldmine; and newspaper strategists chose a business model based on giving away our information rather than finding a way to extract some revenue for it. Both developments have been financially disastrous.</p> <p>There's also a problem we cannot control. Journalism's statesmen and academics may differ, but many reporters have concluded that the fault is neither in our stars, nor in ourselves - but in our audience. Middle-aged readers say other media now trump newspapers. But more and more, reporters mutter, Americans - especially younger people - choose apathy and superficiality, the luxury of living in a normally prosperous superpower. If they want any information, they can get it from blogs - the hobbyist, derivative haven for karaoke journalists. </p> <p>Do I sound bitter, or just resigned? Maybe my future communications mission should be to help turn apathy into engagement - again. Daunting perhaps, even quixotic, but definitely needed.</p>",
  "<p>The most widely anticipated contest of the 2008 Olympic Games turned into one of the more one-sided last night but there were multiple consolations for one billion Chinese fans who watched their nation's basketball side defeated 101 points to 70 by the United States, not least the confirmation that in Yao Ming they have a sporting hero worthy of this, the ultimate sporting stage.</p> <p>On this night of nights the gentle giant from Shanghai was a man possessed, the heart and soul of a country united by the outlandish dream of beating the most powerful basketball nation on earth. It was entirely fitting that he opened the scoring in this contest, sinking a three-point shot from what seemed like downtown Beijing.</p> <p>\"I shot the ball and it just went in,\" said the seven-foot five-inch Yao, who has spent his entire career parked under the basketball net, flipping in two-point shots from all of six inches.</p> <p>Fleetingly home hopes soared.

They even do cheerleaders these days, not to mention hot dogs on sticks.</p> <p>But if East was more than a match for West when it came to unspeakable grub and sparkly Lycra, it came up woefully short when the court was cleared and whistle blown. There was a simple reason for this; in basketball one against five are never good odds.</p> <p>This US squad - replete with NBA stars - has talent to burn, boasting global brands James (Cleveland Cavaliers), Kobe Bryant (LA Lakers), the old-school legend Jason Kidd (Dallas Mavericks) and a fistful of hungry young guns - Chris Paul (New Orleans Hornets), Carmelo Anthony (Denver Nuggets) and Dwayne Wade (Miami Heat) - to name but three.</p> <p>China had Yao although, on a night when most of his team-mates froze in the spotlight, one or two did not, most notably the point guard Chen Jianghua, who briefly took over the burden of responsibility. One move, which saw him dribble from one end of the court to another, stripping the great Bryant of his dignity en route, will live long in the memory. The two points gave the home side an 11-9 lead.</p> <p>Alas for Chen, alas for China, Bryant is a prideful man who is disinclined to put up too long with such public humiliations and he quickly restored the US's lead with a couple of baskets. In the end the Los Angeles Lakers star - widely acknowledged as the greatest individual talent in the game - scored 13 points, many of them sculpted by athleticism and agility of which others can only dream.</p> <p>Yet it says much about the talent available to the US coach, Mike Krzyzewski, that Bryant took second billing on the night to his team-mates, James, who scored 18 points, and Wade, who shot a perfect seven out of seven shots, scoring 19 points.</p> <p>China's top scorer was, naturally, Yao, who managed 13 points, the majority of them in the first half, when the two sides exchanged the lead. But it is exhausting work carrying a nation of 1.3 billion people on your back and eventually not even the big man was capable of stemming the tide.</p> <p>Four points up at the end of the first quarter, the US established a 49-37 advantage by half-time. Thereafter it was simply a question of by how much, as the greater size and strength of the American players wore down their opponents.</p> <p>With defeat inevitable, and vital qualification games ahead, the Chinese coach, Jonas Kazlauskas, took the precaution of resting his star but even from the bench Yao struck an imposing figure as he cajoled his team-mates in pursuit of a dignified ending.</p> <p>That they did not - a 31-point defeat is not the result the Chinese nation had imagined, not even in its darkest moments - was a pity but from a neutral's perspective it was hardly unexpected. Nor was it hard to explain. \"Psychologically it was very difficult for us to play in this game because these guys [James, Bryant] are heroes to some of our players,\" said Kazlauskas afterwards.</p> <p>This was an honest appraisal from an honest man but he had no reason to feel so glum. In Yao Ming China he has the greatest hero of all.</p>",
  "<p>Goody. At last Guardian readers have responded to an issue raised in this column. That some may have done so rather rudely is neither here nor there. The issue is up and running, which is what counts. My argument was and is that Gordon Brown's eco-towns will need innovative design if they are not to be environmentally catastrophic and totally dysfunctional. My view of vernacular architecture is that it is a thing of the past - often lovely to look at, terrible to live in. I thought I had made that clear, but some readers didn't get it.</p> <p>Last year, Elaine Knutt enthused on the website of Building Design, the architects' magazine, that: \"The best minds on the planet will soon be invited to submit ideas for the 10,000-home settlements . . . Planning new towns from scratch, we can design the integrated transport and renewable energy systems that allow residents to live without negative impact on the environment.\" We can, we could - but we won't.</p> <p>In 2007, housing minister Yvette Cooper described the proposed development of Northstowe, north-west of Cambridge, as a \"prototype for eco-towns\". The shelves of local libraries groan under the tons of bumf that \"master-developer\" Gallagher Estates and English Partnerships have produced in support of their proposal, lavishly illustrated with artists' impressions of a town very like Stevenage or perhaps Harlow. The text is a farrago of buzzwords - \"sustainability\", \"carbon neutrality\", \"balance between the built and the ecological environment\", \"energy efficiency\" - but there is nothing in the way of an integrated plan, unless the Cambridgeshire Guided Busway represents \"integrated transport\". The developers are considering the possible role of biomass boilers for schools, and ground-source heat pumps for some commercial buildings. At some stage in the future, they might consider \"district heating networks with energy centres powered by bio-mass and large-scale turbines\", but not yet.</p> <p>I doubt the Northstowe developers have any intention of replicating on a grand scale the 12 eco-houses of the much-feted Great Bow Yard at Langport in Somerset. Though Northstowe's houses are likely to be cheaply built, they are unlikely to be cheap to buy. It is equally unlikely that they will be carbon neutral, though they may very well make a virtuous display of solar panels.</p> <p>In a letter to the Guardian, Liz Wilhide accused me of not knowing my eco from my elbow, because I said that \"solar panels were best installed en masse on flat roofs\". According to her: \"They work most efficiently at a tilt angle of 30-40 degrees because of our latitude, which makes the pitch of the average British roof eminently suitable.\" By the average British roof, I suppose she means the roof of the usual British house, which is not pitched at 30-40 degrees, but at what roofers call 5/12, five inches rise for 12 inches extent, which gives you an angle of 23 degrees or so. The most elegant English urban domestic architecture affords no glimpse of the \"average\" roof. Queen Anne houses hide their lead and slate behind balustrades, as do the Georgian terraces of Bath. It is the mock farmhouses of the leafier suburbs that make a feature of a steeply pitched roof, as do Scandinavian eco-homes. The steeper the pitch, the greater the proportion of the construction cost invested in the roof. There is little chance that the 9,500 homes to be crammed into 189 hectares in Northstowe will have eaves, let alone acres of steeply pitched roofs.</p> <p>Ms Wilhide should have realised that I did not say that the panels should be laid flat on the flat roof, but \"installed\" on it. Your solar panel should, like the sunflower, follow the sun. If no part of your roof lies along the east-west axis with a slope to the south, there is nowhere a solar panel laid on it will work worth a damn. Mounted on pivots on a flat roof, the panels can stand correctly oriented to catch all the available sunlight. More importantly, there could be enough of them and they could be big enough to make the operation worthwhile, if not exactly cost-effective. In Canada, Ontario Solar Farms pays rent to private owners for the use of flat rooftop space for the installation of photovoltaic systems. Though southern Ontario is 10 degrees or so closer to the equator than we are, the tilt of the panels is closer to 70 degrees than 40. In England, solar panels are best hung on a south-facing mansard as they are in Great Bow Yard, but the visual impact plus the installation cost represent a high price to pay for heating a third of the hot water used by the average household.</p> <p>Northstowe will consist of an inner core of shops and businesses within a ring of three-storey townhouses, surrounded by tracts of two-storey housing. It would be possible to build the commercial buildings and the inner terraces of housing under a single roof run, which could accommodate a solar farm of hundreds of massive panels. But it is doubtful whether the energy harvest would justify the initial cost; there just isn't enough sun. The planners will have to commit to something more efficient. Quickly.</p>",

  "<p>Draft government proposals to soften the blow of rising fuel bills by spreading relief across all British families with children this winter have been disclosed by a senior Whitehall official who was overheard discussing options on a Leeds to London train, it was confirmed last night.</p> <p>But claims that ministers may give \u00a3150 to all 7.5 million families which claim child benefit - a far wider net than expected - was dismissed as inaccurate speculation at a stage when the government's detailed response to turmoil in the global food, fuel and financial markets is still being developed. </p> <p>Ministers are casting around for ways of paying for such help at a time when the Treasury's revenues are falling and its costs rising as the economy dips sharply. One favourite option is a windfall tax on energy giants or their carbon emissions. Help had been expected to be focused on poor families and elderly poor. </p> <p>Child benefit is a universal one, not means-tested, payable to youngsters up to 16, or to 18 for those still in education or training. Though Gordon Brown has long favoured targeting extra benefits to the neediest, a universalist gesture would have greater political impact for No 10.</p> <p>Sir Brian Bender, permanent secretary at the Department of business, enterprise and regulatory reform, added to their woes by discussing fuel options with a junior colleague on the 3.05 from Leeds to London two weeks ago. They were overheard by a media executive who later identified Sir Brian from official photographs.</p> <p>Officials at the department do not deny that their boss was on the train, but will not discuss what he said. \"We are looking at ways of dealing with the issue, no decisions have yet been taken,\" a spokesman said. </p> <p>Bender did not mention the \u00a3150 option - which is said to be inaccurate - but his remarks made front pages yesterday. </p> <p>The incident follows a week of media-driven speculation over government action to help stabilise the falling housing market, stalled since the US sub-prime crisis. The chancellor, Alistair Darling, and housing minister Caroline Flint have been accused of dithering over a possible stamp duty holiday and thereby of creating even greater uncertainty. They deny it.</p> <p>Last night the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Philip Hammond said: \"Britain faces yet more confusion on the back of this new speculation about the government's plans. If Gordon Brown had acted prudently and put money aside for a rainy day during the good years, as all our competitors did, he wouldn't be floundering now, floating all sorts of ideas that he doesn't know how to pay for.

  "<p>'Why on earth,\" says Anne Portehault, chaining her bicycle to a railing opposite the H\u00f4tel de Ville in Paris, \"would I want to put a cycle helmet over my hair? I would look ridiculous.\" Well, not ridiculous, I counter, but you would certainly look less chic and enviably coiffed than currently. The 39-year-old is angry enough that from the autumn, Parisian cyclists will be required to wear fluorescent jackets. \"They only cost a couple of euros but they make anyone who dresses well - such as me - look absurd. That yucky yellow - I've got nothing to match it in my wardrobe. What am I going to do?\"</p> <p>But what about the danger of your brains spilling out of your head after being knocked over by one of the French capital's aggressive drivers? Isn't ridiculousness a small price to pay? I remind Portehault that it was nearly on this spot, outside the BHV department store on the Rue de Rivoli, in 1980 that the life of one of France's great penseurs, Roland Barthes, was brought to an end when he was run over by a van. \"I pay a lot of attention to the traffic,\" replies Portehault. \"I'm very careful when I cycle. So, no, I don't think looking ridiculous is worth it.\" </p> <p>It's worth pointing out that it's not only Parisian women who worry about their hairdos being mangled by helmets. A young man chaining his bicycle to a lamppost, who declines to give me his name, says: \"I've spent ages gelling my hair. I'm not going to ruin all that work, thanks very much.\" I find Marco Simioni, 45, a Paris-based architect and artist who originally hails from Vicenza, poised to ride off on a hired cycle. \"I've only been cycling for four months and I try to be very careful, but it's true I run a risk not using a helmet. It's a risk I'm prepared to take.\"</p> <p>I've come to Paris to find out why there is such a difference between French and British cyclists when it comes to wearing helmets. A few years ago, when I worked in Paris for the Guardian, I always wore a helmet when I cycled through the Marais to my office near the Op\u00e9ra Garnier and looked in disdain at the flowing locks of my more hirsute fellow cyclists as they cheated death and looked glamorous. Now, thanks to mayor Bertrand Delano\u00eb's bicycle rental scheme, V\u00e9lib, which was introduced just over a year ago, there are more Parisian locks flying in the wind than ever.</p> <p>In France there is a slang phrase \"C'est relou\", which translates as \"It's boring.\" \"C'est relou de porter un casque,\" several cyclists told me. It's boring to wear a cycle helmet. But not just boring: ugly, unstylish, fundamentally un-French.</p> <p>\"There is a great cultural difference between the English and the French,\" says Anne Portehault. \"We are very, very independent and very rebellious. This is the home of liberty, after all.\" Portehault, who rides horses in the morning and works in an American law office in the afternoon, doesn't use the sturdy V\u00e9lib bikes that can be hired from ranks one finds every 300m in Paris. Instead, she favours a venerable yellow number dating from the 1960s, which used to belong to her sister. \"It works but it looks rubbish. So no one's going to steal it.\"</p> <p>I'm not sure that Gallic rebelliousness tells the whole story of why, if you cross the Channel, helmet-wearing cyclists become much rarer. Perhaps, and this is just a theory, the British are more risk-averse than continentals. Indeed, the difference is not just between Britons and continental Europeans, but between many anglophone countries and others. Cycle helmets are common in the UK, the US, New Zealand and Australia. But if you go to some of the cities where cycling has a prouder history than in Britain - cities such as Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Berlin or Shanghai - you will find very few cycle helmets. </p> <p>Of course, it's unfair to over-generalise. On a nearby side street, I find a Parisian cyclist wearing not only a helmet, but a fluorescent jacket and sensible gloves. Why, I ask 35-year-old Laurent Marin, do you not bend your knee to Paris's prevailing sartorial strictures for cyclists? \"A few years ago I was cycling at the Porte de la Villette when I saw a motorcyclist was run over by a car. It was horrible. I rang my wife and said: 'I'm going to be late because I'm going to buy a helmet.' Now I won't let my wife or my children go cycling without helmets.\" Courier Felix Nizard, 20, tells me that he wears a cycle helmet his friend gave him. It seems several sizes too big, I say. \"Yes, but it looks kind of cool with the advertising all over it,\" he retorts. \"I feel happier wearing it now with all the V\u00e9libbers around. They are making the city more dangerous.\"</p> <p>The number of cycle journeys has grown exponentially in Paris since the introduction of the V\u00e9lib scheme, and many of the inexperienced users do indeed \"cycle like idiots\", as Marin says. That said, there have only been three reported cases of V\u00e9libbers being killed. On France's bicycling blogs, this is a hot issue. One blogger, a man who styles himself Ludovic Bu, wrote recently: \"The figures are clear: three deaths in a year and 24m journeys on V\u00e9lib bicycles. That amounts to a 0.0000125% probability of killing yourself while using a V\u00e9lib bicycle.\" But he adds that in Paris last year, 53% of those who died or were injured on Paris streets were motorcyclists, 22% pedestrians, drivers of four-wheeled vehicles 18% and cyclists only 7%. \"Thus, one can well see that it is less dangerous to travel on a bicycle than on a motorbike, on foot or by car.\"</p> <p>I'm not at all sure these figures warrant the inference that cycling in Paris is safe, but that doesn't matter: such rhetoric contributes to a blithe attitude on the part of Parisian cyclists towards sustaining death or serious injury. It makes them less likely to even consider whether wearing a helmet would be worthwhile.</p> <p>Delan\u00f6e's aim, according to many Parisians I spoke to, is to make Paris more like Amsterdam, where cycling is such a venerable and popular mode of transport that cyclists ride without helmets with a confidence that actually has some foundation. One Dutch idea that both the British and French authorities might consider introducing is the law of \"strict liability\" whereby, in any collision between a cycle and a car, the motorist is deemed to be responsible. This makes motorists much more wary. And what about the woonerf, a street or group of streets where pedestrians and cyclists have legal priority over motorists, and where motorised traffic is restricted to a speed limit of \"walking pace\"? In Germany, they have similar zones called Verkehrsberuhigter Bereich, where motorised speed limits are restricted to 7km/h. If only Paris's Rue de Rivoli or, say, London's Embankment became woonerven or Verkehrsberuhigter Bereich tomorrow, then I might consider leaving my helmet at home. But they aren't, so I won't.</p> <p>Matt Seaton, the Guardian's former cycling columnist and author of On Your Bike!: The Complete Guide to Cycling, distinguishes sharply between cycling in continental northern Europe and elsewhere. \"In northern Europe, especially in countries such as Holland and Denmark, there is much more of a consensus that bicycles have priority. In Britain, it's much more of a war of all against all. France is somewhere in between. In Britain our road environment is much more of a free market and that may make cyclists ride more quickly and aggressively than they do in the rest of Europe.\" </p> <p>It is also worth pointing out that in Britain we tend not to ride the sit-up-and-beg bicycles common in Holland; we ride mountain bikes and racing cycles that, you might well think, facilitate aggressive cycling. I once saw a cyclist respond to being abused by pedestrians for jumping a zebra crossing by leaping off his bike waving a D-lock like a mace. There is a medieval flavour to London's cycle scene. In that road environment, British cyclists dress up like extras from Rollerball or Blade Runner, almost as if they are going to war and expecting serious injury. The cycle helmet is part of the uniform. </p> <p>But is wearing a helmet actually going to save one from injury? This is a vexed issue among cyclists. The fact that London's tousle-haired Tory mayor Boris Johnson now eschews a cycle helmet has focused the debate. \"It's a very bad example for the leader of a capital city to set,\" said Simon Turner, a 41-year-old cyclist who suffered permanent brain injuries as a result of falling from his bicycle in Richmond Park. \"He's saying, 'Don't worry, take the risk.'\" </p> <p>\"In my efforts to do the right thing,\" Johnson replied in a newspaper column, \"I have ended up giving offence to both opposing factions. As soon as I started to wear a helmet , I was denounced as a wimp. As soon as I was pictured not wearing a helmet, I was attacked for 'sending out the wrong signal'.\" Cyclists, he argued, should have the right to choose \"hatless, sun-blessed, windswept liberty\" or \" helmeted security\".</p> <p>What would happen if Boris's brains were spilled, say, at the cycle lights next to Islington Central Library on Holloway Road near the mayor's home? Would cyclists pull up to his twitching, prone form, solemnly remove their helmets and say, \"Told you so\"? The issue was recently aired in the London Evening Standard, where columnist Dr Mark Porter defended Johnson's decision to cycle helmetless on the grounds that in over 20 years in medicine he had never had to treat a cyclist with a life-threatening head injury. \"Indeed, the Bicycle Helmet Research Foundation estimates that the average cyclist would have to pedal the roads for more than 3,000 years to suffer a serious head injury, let alone one that would be mitigated by a cycle helmet,\" wrote Porter. \"Research suggests that the mere donning of protective gear such as helmets encourages cyclists to take more risks on the road, and therefore, paradoxically, increase their risk of serious injury.\" Porter added that he was happy for his children to cycle without helmets.</p> <p>This column provoked a letter from Dr Andrew Curran, consultant paediatric neurologist at Alder Hey hospital. \"The probability of having an accident resulting in a serious head injury which could be mitigated by a helmet is mercifully low: there are many kinds of high-impact crashes where a helmet, or any form of body protection, would not save you. But the issue is that if an unhelmeted child is involved in a non-fatal crash resulting in a serious head injury, there is a 50 to 70% chance it will result in a serious cognitive deficit . . . It seems sensible that, just as we immunise children against serious diseases they are very unlikely to catch, we ensure they take precautions against the possibility of head injuries, however rare. The blase attitude of Boris Johnson and cycle campaigners on this point surprises me.\"</p> <p>The rise in cycle helmet use in the past quarter of a century suggests that Johnson is swimming against the tide. From the mid-80s onwards, a steadily increasing proportion of cyclists has worn helmets. The Department for Transport found in 2006 that cycle helmet-wearing had risen from 28.2% on major roads in 2004 to 30.7% in 2006, while on minor roads the figures were 9.6% and 13.8%.</p> <p>The total number of deaths of cyclists in the UK has been falling almost steadily since 1934, when there were 1,536 cyclist deaths. In 2007, there were 136. No one, however, has yet demonstrated that the rise in helmet use has made any contribution to that decline. Indeed, there is a statistic that associates a rise in helmet use with an increased risk of cyclists suffering </p> <p>serious head injuries. When cycle helmets were made compulsory in Australia the number of people cycling fell by a third, and although the number of serious head injuries fell, too, it only fell by 11%. So, despite a large rise in Australia in helmet use, the risk of head injury among those who continued to cycle actually rose. Of course, one can't infer from this that cycle helmets cause serious head injuries, but the statistical association of a rise in both helmet use and in head injuries is embarrassing for those who advocate helmets.</p> <p>What is a bicycle helmet supposed to do? The short answer is that it is supposed to reduce the risk of both skull and, more importantly, brain injuries caused by the brain jolting around inside the skull as the result of collision. According to the DfT's paper Bicycle Helmets: A Review of Effectiveness, \"While simple fractures to the skull can heal, brain injuries, unlike those to other body regions, do not and can lead to long-term consequences. \"A bicycle helmet is supposed to perform three functions, namely: \"reduce the deceleration of the skull; spread the area over which the forces of impact apply; and prevent direct impact between the skull and impacting object.\"</p> <p>The DfT paper concludes: \"There is now a considerable amount of scientific evidence that bicycle helmets have been found to be effective at reducing head, brain and upper facial injury in bicyclists.\"</p> <p>How are they supposed to do that? According to the DfT: \"These three functions can be achieved by combining the properties of the soft, crushable material [usually polystyrene] that is incorporated into helmets, usually referred to as the liner . . . and the outer surface of the helmet, usually called the shell.\" Historically, helmets had hard shells but now the tendency is for there to be no shell at all or a very thin shell.</p> <p>The blogosphere, however, seethes with sceptics who argue that bicycle helmets do not work when they are struck by fast-moving vehicles or when a cycle helmet hits a kerb or road at speed. Some argue that they may produce a false sense of security and a cavalier attitude to risk. \"Their design-intended strength is equivalent to a impact speed of about 12.5mph,\" writes cycling blogger Patrick Herring. \"They were never intended for collisions with cars. They're not a cycle-equivalent of motorbike crash helmets (and you can't wear one of those because your brain would boil). They work by the outer shell keeping the polystyrene in place whilst it absorbs the deceleration by being crushed. Counter-intuitively, if the shell breaks in the initial contact the total energy absorbed is a lot less: a broken helmet is one that didn't work.\"</p> <p>This, he says, means that above about 12.5mph the helmet has little effect; certainly it won't make a 30mph crash feel as if it happened at 17.5mph. </p> <p>One psychological study, meanwhile, suggests that helmets make cyclists more, not less, vulnerable. Two years ago, Dr Ian Walker, a travel psychologist at the University of Bath, had his bicycle fitted with a special sensor and then went off riding, sometimes wearing a helmet, sometimes not, and sometimes wearing a wig intended to make him look like a woman. It is, incidentally, marvellous that a) there is such a thing as a travel psychologist and b) that they get to do such fun-sounding research.</p> <p>The sensor measured the proximity of passing traffic. When Walker rode bareheaded, cars gave him a wider berth than if he was wearing a helmet. They gave, on average, an extra 85mm. Dr Walker concluded that this was because his dearth of proper kit indicated a lack of cycling competence that might result in wobbling, unannounced 45-degree turns, unscheduled wheelies etc. Helmetless, he looked more vulnerable. When he wore a helmet, motorists passed closer. On two occasions they passed so close that they hit him. \"One of the main findings,\" says Dr Walker, \"was that a behaviour intended to reduce risk (putting on a bicycle helmet) might paradoxically increase one's overall level of risk because drivers react to its presence by changing their behaviour.\"</p> <p>But it's what Dr Walker did next that I find particularly suggestive. He cycled about wearing a black wig that made him look - at least to his satisfaction - like a woman from the rear. He found that motorists gave him a wider berth than normal, which he ascribed to a gender effect: motorists are more considerate of women rather than men cyclists. Of course, there is another possibility, namely that Dr Walker was so poor a female impersonator that motorists, possibly out of solidarity with real women, or conceivably because they thought he looked barmy, steered clear. I haven't seen the photos of the experiment, so I can't be sure.</p> <p>What I find interesting is that this research suggests that women cyclists with more hair than is fair (or men cyclists impersonating such women) are less likely to be run over than mugs like me who wear cycle helmets. Which brings us back to Anne Portehault. </p> <p>I forgot to tell her that there is a new, putatively stylish cycling helmet cover devised to \"encourage females to cycle\". The \"cycle head dress\" is essentially a hat that you can put over your helmet to make yourself look chic. Have a look at their range at <a href=\"http://hi1-designs.com\">hi1-designs.com</a>. </p> <p>Portehault probably wouldn't have liked the cycle head dress. After all, Parisiennes like her have no need of helmets or helmet covers, and they have research from Bath University to support their lifestyle choices. There she goes now, cycling down the Rue de Rivoli, one of Paris's more terrifying one-way boulevards, wind in her hair, as chic as can be as the photographer takes her picture. You'll have to excuse me for feeling more than a little jealous. If only I had more hair and was a woman, I think as she rides off towards the Palais de Louvre, I might feel safe without a helmet as I cycled. Or maybe I should get a wig.</p> <p><strong>Have your say: Should cyclists wear helmets?</strong> <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/news\">blogs.theguardian.com/news</a></p>",

Ordinary people, maybe - but they have mind-boggling tales to tell.<br><a href=\"http://www.thislife.org\">thislife.org</a></p> <h2>Rob Long's Martini Shot</h2> <p>Although not quite as buttock-twistingly uncomfortable as Curb Your Enthusiasm, the weekly Martini Shot, from Cheers producer Rob Long, is a four-minute dose of the farcical shenanigans required for people like him to keep afloat in Hollywood. Long takes a swipe at the business with a clenched fist, albeit one hidden under lots of self-deprecation - after all, he's got to keep working in Tinseltown. Alongside the embarrassing lunches and bungled pitches, Long takes a serious look at how TV and film are getting to grips with the internet and the shifting sands of audiences and money. <br><a href=\"http://www.kcrw.com/etc/programs/ma\">kcrw.com/etc/programs/ma</a></p> <h2>Sound Transit</h2> <p>The front page of Sound Transit looks like a portal for a chic travel agent. Inside, you are invited to \"book a transit\": you specify a city and country for the start and end points of your journey, as well as the number of stopovers. Dipping into its growing archive of field recordings from around the world, the site then mixes you an MP3 journey, taking you through sounds captured in the locations specified. Each section fades gently through to the next to create an audio trip. You can download or send the MP3 to friends - or just search for individual sounds and locations. These phonographic communities are building audio maps of cities, allowing you to hear - as well as see - around the world.<br><a href=\"http://soundtransit.nl/\">soundtransit.nl</a></p> <h2>Radio AM 1710 Antioch OTR</h2> <p>\"I'm just a footloose cowpuncher that's anxious to make some money.\" So said the Lone Ranger back in 1944. And now, thanks to Antioch Old Time Radio - broadcasting from a house just inland from Lake Michigan - you can spend your whole life listening to lines like that, from US radio dramas from the 30s, 40s and 50s. There are 18,000 shows on the server, divided into police, detective, science fiction, suspense, mystery, family comedy and more. If only laptops came in Bakelite. <br><a href=\"http://radio.macinmind.com\">radio.macinmind.com</a></p> <h2>Philosophy Bites</h2> <p>Melvyn Bragg gets away with opening his BBC show In Our Time with lines such as: \"Hello, in 1822 the Irish philosopher William Thompson put forward a theory . . .\" But generally, in broadcast, things have to be more digestible. Philosophy Bites is a 10- to 20-minute show where philosophers are interviewed on \"bite-sized\" topics such as \"Do you own your own body? If not, who does?\" and \"Can a nation be collectively responsible for actions?\" David Edmonds and Nigel Warburton, philosophers and broadcasters, take turns to run these miniature debates. The episode with Hugh Mellor, discussing the nature of tense and time, is mesmerisingly convoluted.<br><a href=\"http://www.nigelwarburton.typepad.com/philosophy_bites/\">nigelwarburton.typepad.com/philosophy_bites/</a></p> <h2>Lost and Found Sound by the Kitchen Sisters</h2> <p>Buster Keaton singing at a party, the recordings of a 19-year-old marine in the Vietnam war, a five-year-old Sofia Coppola being interviewed by her father, Francis Ford . . . these and many other recordings have been unearthed by Davia Nelson and Nikki Silva, aka the Kitchen Sisters, in collaboration with Jay Allison. Most of these treasures are sent in by the public, perhaps people who had stumbled across a box of old tapes in an attic - and they are played as part of National Public Radio's All Things Considered show, which encourages listeners to phone or send in stories of recordings of interest. Also available through the Kitchen Sisters website is their sonic memorial to the World Trade Center - another idea that relied upon the public sending in recordings and phone messages related to 9/11.<br><a href=\"http://www.kitchensisters.org\">kitchensisters.org</a> and <a href=\"http://www.npr.org\">npr.org</a></p> <h2>Speechification</h2> <p>Speechification gathers the best - as it hears it - of speech radio: \"A blog of Radio 4. Not about Radio 4 but of it. We point to the bits we like, the bits you might have missed, the bits that someone might have sneakily recorded. Other speech radio from around the world will no doubt find its way here too.\" It's a credit to the BBC that there's so much of its output featured here, but there is also choice material from other international stations. You can even hear Will Self talking about psychogeography while he walks from La Guardia airport to Manhattan.<br><a href=\"http://www.speechification.com\">speechification.com</a></p> <h2>Radio Lab</h2> <p>Presenters Jad Abumrad and Robert Krulwich recently asked their readers whether their show was a \"science\" show or not. Listeners emailed to say that they had never considered it a science show because it was too \"groovy and playful\". As the presenters' biographies reveal, Emmy-winning Krulwich has \"explored the structure of DNA with a banana, explained arbitrage by wearing Groucho glasses and illustrated the Texaco-Pennzoil battle with Barbie and Ken dolls\"; while Abumrad is also a musician who has written scores for films. The result is a polished combination of interviews, anecdotes and experiments. Laughter - a show examining why we have evolved to chuckle - features a scientist tickling a rat.<br><a href=\"http://www.wnyc.org/shows/radiolab\">wnyc.org/shows/radiolab</a></p> <h2>Touch Radio</h2> <p>Touch, an independent arts organisation that turned 25 last year, is home to artists such as Christian Fennesz, Biosphere and Chris Watson. Touch Radio features challenging and entertaining material, including field recordings, interviews and live performances. There are audio diaries from Chris Watson, where he illuminates his work as a wildlife sound recordist in the Galapagos Islands, taking in the Alcedo volcano. If you are truly tired of words by this stage, you will find an antidote in Touch 10: The Bits Inbetween by Vicki Bennett, whose own show on WFMU, a glorious mashup (<a href=\"http://peoplelikeus.org\">peoplelikeus.org</a>), will leave you in a spin. <a href=\"http://www.touchradio.org.uk\">touchradio.org.uk</a><br><strong>Pascal Wyse</strong></p> <p><strong>From dubstep to Danny DeVito:</strong></p> <h2>Sub FM</h2> <p>Acclaimed, award-winning station dealing in what it terms \"online pirate soundz\". Its backbone is dubstep and grime, but the remit stretches from roots reggae to sub-genres so cutting edge you occasionally wonder if they made them up. What, for example, is \"niche\"? <br><a href=\"http://www.subfm.com\">subfm.com</a></p> <h2>WFMU-FM 91.1 FM</h2> <p>Home to an acclaimed country and western show hosted by singer Laura Cantrell, WFMU describes its output thus: \"Rock'n'roll, 78rpm records, jazz, psychedelia, hip-hop, hand-cranked wax cylinders, punk rock, gospel, exotica, R&amp;B.\" And, if that's not enough, there's \"Andrew Lloyd Webber soundtracks in languages other than English\".<br><a href=\"http://www.wfmu.org\">wfmu.org</a></p> <h2>FiP</h2> <p>Largely presenter-free French station, with an implausibly eclectic playlist. A typical selection involves Cameroonian singer Sally Nyolo, followed by Jethro Tull, the theme from The Godfather, then Serge Gainsbourg.<br><a href=\"http://www.radiofrance.fr/chaines/fip/endirect/index.php\">radiofrance.fr/chaines/fip/endirect/index.php</a></p> <h2>Rock-It Radio </h2> <p>One of the joys of internet radio is the way it gives a global voice to monomaniacal music fans. Mock their trainspotterish obsessions if you want, but they know what they're talking about. Rock-It Radio takes the gold, collating doo-wop, rockabilly and related shows from around the world - including game attempts at recreating the 1950s radio experience, jive-talking DJs and all.<br><a href=\"http://www.rockitradio.net\">rockitradio.net</a></p> <h2>KCRW</h2> <p>Another US public radio station, this time broadcast out of Santa Monica college and famed for its influential Morning Becomes Eclectic show. Its live sessions are great (recent visitors include Spiritualized, Goldfrapp and Vampire Weekend), while the rest of the station's music programming is fascinating - not least its guest DJ series, which recently featured Danny DeVito playing opera.<br><a href=\"http://www.kcrw.com\">kcrw.com</a></p> <h2>Erol Alkan</h2> <p>The hip DJ, producer and brains behind London's legendary Trash nightclub hosts a series of consistently superb mixes on his website; you can subscribe via iTunes. Those under his own name tend towards electro and indie, while those from Beyond the Wizards' Sleeve find him in partnership with Richard Norris of the Grid, playing obscure 60s psychedelia, kitschy soundtracks and their own \"nu-Balearic\" remixes of current artists. Many are recorded live in clubs, injecting a palpable sense of dancefloor excitement. <br><a href=\"http://www.erolalkan.co.uk\">erolalkan.co.uk</a></p> <h2>Resonance FM</h2> <p>Rightly famed for producing some of the most avant-garde radio in the UK, Resonance was the home of Talking a Life for a Walk, in which a woman recorded herself perambulating around London with her 18-month-old son while playing the saxophone. It also plays brilliant music largely ignored elsewhere, devoting shows to krautrock, Middle Eastern pop, dub reggae and trad folk. Particularly recommended is Max Tundra's splendidly eclectic Rotogravure, where disco collides with afrobeat, post-rock, folk, techno and (occasionally) the Buggles. <br><a href=\"http://resonancefm.com\">resonancefm.com</a><br><strong>Alexis Petridis</strong></p>",
  "<p><strong>No place for privacy on the moral high ground</strong></p> <p>Norman Fowler suggests (When the personal becomes political, August 4) that \"politicians should be ready to say that private affairs are politically irrelevant\". Up to a point.</p> <p>Some politicians still wag their fingers at the rest of the population about \"traditional family values\" from the tiny territory that is the moral high ground, usually voting accordingly. </p> <p>Should such aficionados of call girls (Lord Archer), mistresses (Lords Archer, Coe and Parkinson and MPs James Gray and Piers Merchant) and massage parlours (Joe Ashton) really be in a position to complain if their opponents decide that their extracurricular activities warrant public comment?<br><strong>Ben Summerskill</strong>, chief executive, Stonewall </p> <p>\u00b7 I agree with a good deal of what Norman Fowler writes, but his analysis of his own government's proposals for a law of privacy is well wide of the mark.</p> <p>What was proposed was a tort of infringement of privacy, to be enforced by the victim in the civil courts, with a defence of public interest for the person or organisation alleged to be doing it. </p> <p>That would have put the law pretty much where it is now after the Max Mosley case, where the judge took care to distinguish - as the original proposal did - between what interests the public and what is in the public's interest to know. </p> <p>The difference is that, if the government hadn't got cold feet, we would have got to the same position 13 years earlier.</p> <p>The reason it failed was not because the government was trying vainly to \"decide which media investigations are justified and which are not\". That would have been down to the courts. It failed because the majority of newspapers deliberately conflated those two concepts that Mr Justice Eady kept apart, and claimed that the only purpose of the proposal was to protect politicians from having their private lives exposed. </p> <p>The Major government duly took fright - perhaps understandably, in the circumstances, but had they had wider interests in mind, they could have stood their ground. Because, as was clear to anyone who read the green paper itself, rather than the version the media touted, merely reporting insignificant peccadilloes would have been unlawful, whereas exposing hypocrisy wouldn't. The conclusion that Norman Fowler wants would have been provided.</p> <p>And, more importantly, people other than politicians would also have been able to use the law, to protect themselves against the media and against others who intrude unjustifiably on their privacy.<br><strong>Se\u00e1n Langley</strong>, Buckland, Surrey </p> <p><strong>Support your local </strong></p> <p>Why do the publishers not withdraw their magazines and newspapers from all the supermarkets and support the local newsagents instead (That's Asda price, August 4)?

  "<p>We need to get prepared for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/06/climatechange.scienceofclimatechange\">four degrees of global warming</a>, Bob Watson told the Guardian last week. At first sight this looks like wise counsel from the climate science adviser to Defra. But the idea that we could adapt to a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/07/carbonemissions.climatechange\">4C rise</a> is absurd and dangerous. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climatechange\">Global warming</a> on this scale would be a catastrophe that would mean, in the immortal words that Chief Seattle probably never spoke, \"the end of living and the beginning of survival\" for humankind. Or perhaps the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/08/kingsnorthclimatecamp.climatechange\">beginning of our extinction</a>.</p> <p>The collapse of the polar ice caps would become inevitable, bringing long-term <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2007/dec/05/climatechange.flooding?picture=331454811\">sea level rises</a> of 70-80 metres. All the world's coastal plains would be lost, complete with ports, cities, transport and industrial infrastructure, and much of the world's most productive farmland. The world's geography would be transformed much as it was at the end of the last ice age, when sea levels rose by about 120 metres to create the Channel, the North Sea and Cardigan Bay out of dry land. Weather would become extreme and unpredictable, with more frequent and severe droughts, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/08/climatechange.flooding\">floods</a> and hurricanes. The Earth's carrying capacity would be hugely reduced. Billions would undoubtedly die.</p> <p>Watson's call was supported by the government's former chief scientific adviser, Sir David King, who warned that \"if we get to a four-degree rise it is quite possible that we would begin to see a runaway increase\". This is a remarkable understatement. The climate system is already experiencing significant feedbacks, notably the summer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/10/climatechange.arctic\">melting of the Arctic sea ice</a>. The more the ice melts, the more sunshine is absorbed by the sea, and the more the Arctic warms. And as the Arctic warms, the release of billions of tonnes of methane \u2013 a greenhouse gas 70 times stronger than carbon dioxide over 20 years \u2013 captured under melting permafrost is already under way.</p> <p>To see how far this process could go, look 55.5m years to the Palaeocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, when a global temperature increase of 6C coincided with the release of about 5,000 gigatonnes of carbon into the atmosphere, both as CO2 and as methane from bogs and seabed sediments. Lush subtropical forests grew in polar regions, and sea levels rose to 100m higher than today. It appears that an initial warming pulse triggered other warming processes. Many scientists warn that this historical event may be analogous to the present: the warming caused by human emissions could propel us towards a similar hothouse Earth.</p> <p>But what are we to do? All our policies to date to tackle global warming have been miserable failures. The Kyoto protocol has created a vast carbon market but done little to reduce emissions. The main effect of the EU's emissions trading scheme has been to transfer about \u20ac30bn or more from consumers to Europe's biggest polluters, the power companies. The EU and US foray into <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/biofuels\">biofuels</a> has, at huge cost, increased greenhouse gas <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbonemissions\">emissions</a> and created a world <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/food\">food crisis</a>, causing starvation in many poor countries.</p> <p>So are all our efforts doomed to failure? Yes, so long as our governments remain craven to special interests, whether <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/10/emissionstrading.utilities\">carbon traders</a> or fossil fuel companies. The carbon market is a valuable tool, but must be subordinate to climatic imperatives. The truth is that to prevent runaway greenhouse warming, we will have to leave most of the world's fossil fuels in the ground, especially carbon-heavy coal, oil shales and tar sands. The fossil fuel and power companies must be faced down. </p> <p>Global problems need global solutions, and we also need an effective replacement for the failed Kyoto protocol. The entire Kyoto system of national allocations is obsolete because of the huge volumes of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/energy\">energy</a> embodied in products traded across national boundaries. It also presents a major obstacle to any new agreement \u2013 as demonstrated by the 2008 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/08/g8\">G8 meeting</a> in Japan that degenerated into a squabble over national emission rights.</p> <p>The answer? Scrap national allocations and place a single global cap on greenhouse gas emissions, applied \"upstream\" \u2013 for instance, at the oil refinery, coal-washing station and cement factory. Sell permits up to that cap in a global auction, and use the proceeds to finance solutions to climate change \u2013 accelerating the use of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/renewableenergy\">renewable energy</a>, raising energy efficiency, protecting forests, promoting climate-friendly farming, and researching geoengineering technologies. And commit hundreds of billions of dollars per year to finance adaptation to climate change, especially in poor countries.</p> <p>Such a package of measures would allow us to achieve zero net greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, and long-term stabilisation at 350 parts per million of CO2 equivalent. This avoids the economic pain that a cap-and-trade system alone would cause, and targets assistance at the poor, who are least to blame and most need help. The permit auction would raise about $1 trillion per year, enough to finance a spread of solutions. At a quarter of the world's annual oil spending, it is a price well worth paying.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Oliver Tickell's book Kyoto2 has just been published <a href=\"http://www.kyoto2.org\">kyoto2.org</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To read Bj\u00f6rn Lomborg's response to this article, go <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/15/carbonemissions.climatechange\">here</a></p>",
  "<p>A wave of a suicide bombings and police shootings left eight people<br>dead in western China yesterday, as Uighur Islamic separatists<br>attempted to steal global attention from the Beijing Olympics.</p> <p>In what appears to be one of the most widely coordinated assaults in<br>recent memory, the militants threw or carried home-made explosives<br>into a dozen government sites in Kuqa city, killing a security guard,<br>injuring two police officers, destroying two police cars and damaging<br>trading and commerce offices.</p> <p>Their most ambitious assault involved wheeling a tricycle laden with<br>explosives into a public security bureau just before dawn. One<br>attacker was shot, another blew himself up and two were captured,<br>according to the state-run Xinhua news agency.</p> <p>Six hours later, police tracked down some of the alleged militants in the<br>local marketplace. In the ensuing battle, two militants were reportedly shot and three blew themselves up with bombs made from bent pipes, gas canisters and liquid gas tanks.</p> <p>One suspect was detained, one was taken to hospital, and at least six were thought to have got away. The entire county of 400,000 people has<br>now been cordoned off, business suspended and roadside<br>operations shut. Paramilitaries with machine guns were patrolling the<br>streets.</p> <p>The clashes come less than a week after Xinjiang witnessed the deadliest attack on Chinese security personnel in a decade. Last Monday, two alleged Muslim jihadists in Kashgar drove a lorry at high speed into a rank of jogging paramilarites, then killed the survivors with bombs and knives, eventually claiming 16 lives.</p> <p>The authorities linked the earlier attack to threats made by three separatist groups who want to create an \"East Turkistan\" homeland for ethnic Muslim Uighurs in the region.</p> <p>On Thursday, a previously unknown group calling itself the Turkistan Islamic party released a video threatening to attack buses, trains and planes during Olympic fortnight.</p> <p>Kuqa is more than 3,000 kilometres from Beijing, but Olympic organisers have identified Uighur \"terrorists\" as the main threat to the games. They sought to reassure athletes, journalists and tourists that Sunday's attack would not disrupt the sports event.</p> <p>\"I do not believe this will have an impact on the Olympic games,\" said Wang Wei, the vice president of the games' organising committee. He blamed the assaults on \"East Turkistan terrorists\".</p> <p>Overseas Uighur groups claim the Chinese government is exaggerating the threat posed by separatist extremists as an excuse to impose its will on the Muslim population in Xinjiang.</p> <p>\"The goal of our organisation, and of the vast majority of Uighurs around the world, is to peacefully resolve the problems facing Uighurs in East Turkistan,\" said the US-based Uighur freedom movement leader Rebiya Kadeer. \"We advocate the principle of non-violence, and the promotion of freedom, democracy and human rights through peaceful means. We also sincerely hope for a peaceful Olympic games.\"</p> <p>She accused the Chinese government of a heavy-handed crackdown in Kashgar and throughout East Turkistan in the name of the Olympics, saying Uighurs had experienced higher rates of execution and detention, in addition to forced relocation, police monitoring, passport confiscation, and the destruction of places of worship. Many Uighurs are unhappy that an influx of Han Chinese over the past 50 years has made them a minority in their homeland.</p> <p>Tibetan exile groups also continued to use the games to draw attention<br>to what they say are human rights abuses in the Himalayan region.<br>Five activists, including a Tibetan woman from Germany, Padma-Dolma<br>Fielitz, were dragged off Tiananmen Square after displaying a Tibetan<br>flag and a banner reading saying: \"Tibetans are dying for freedom.\"</p> <p>The continuing unease in many Tibetan communities was highlighted by<br>reports from the Free Tibet Campaign that two women were shot and<br>wounded in Aba county town - the scene of some of the worst violence in<br>March's wave of unrest. According to the group, the shots came from a<br>building being used as a barracks for military reinforcements<br>sent into the area at the start of the month, apparently to ensure<br>there are no protests during the Olympics.</p> <p>George Bush used his visit to Beijing for the opening ceremony to raise the issue of religious freedom and improved human rights. Before meeting the Chinese president, Hu Jintao, and watching swimmer Michael Phelps win gold in the 400-metre individual medley. The US president and his wife attended a church service in the Chinese capital to underline his message.</p> <p>\"Laura and I just had the great joy and privilege of worshipping here in Beijing, China,\" he said as parishioners exited to Onward Christian Soldiers. \"You know, it just goes to show that God is universal, and God is love, and no state, man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion.\"</p> <p>But the authorities remain concerned about extremist groups. More than 100,000 police and paramilitaries have been deployed in the host city - along with 300,000 surveillance cameras - in one of the biggest security operations ever mounted in China.</p> <p>They were unable, however, to prevent the apparently random murder on Saturday of the father-in-law of the US men's volleyball coach. Todd Bachman was stabbed to death and his wife Barbara and a Chinese guide were seriously wounded at Beijing's 13th-century Drum Tower. The killer, 47-year-old Tang Yongming, leapt to his death after the attack.</p> <p>His motive remains a mystery. Tang - who recently retired from a job at a factory in the eastern city of Hangzhou, in Zhejiang province - had arrived in Beijing on August 1. The 47-year-old, who divorced two years ago, had no criminal record.</p> <p>\"His neighbors said they hadn't seen any abnormal behaviour from him before left Hangzhou,\" said a spokesman for the Zhejiang public security bureau.</p> <p>Bush said he was saddened by the stabbing, but thanked his Chinese counterpart for responding with speed and sympathy to the attack. \"I appreciate that a lot,\" Bush told Hu.</p> <p>Violent attacks on foreigners are extremely rare in China. The US<br>ambassador, Clark Randt, visited the survivors in Xiehe hospital, after<br>which the embassy issued a statement saying the attack \"appears to be<br>a senseless act of violence\".</p> <p>\u00b7 This article was amended on Monday August 11 2008. </p>",
  "<p>\"Abolishing council tax and bringing in local income tax remains party policy and will be a manifesto commitment at the next general election,\" said the <a href=\"http://www.libdems.org.uk/\">Cowley Street</a> insider. I had rung Liberal Democrat HQ after reading Patrick Wintour's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/aug/07/liberaldemocrats.taxandspending\">report</a>. It said the party was planning to play down its support for local income tax and back a reform of council tax instead. And I scented a row.</p> <p>But the insider was adamant. Yes, Vince Cable \u2013 the Lib Dems' shadow chancellor \u2013 wants to do more work on implementing and selling local income tax, but the idea is not being junked.</p> <p>\"Can I call you 'a friend of Vince Cable'?\" I asked eventually, thinking of this article.</p> <p>\"I would be honoured,\" the insider replied.</p> <p>And we Lib Dems would all be honoured to be friends of Vince. He has inherited Ming Campbell's knack of seeming above the party fray, and added a talent for the wounding phrase that is all his own.</p> <p>The result is that Cable tends to get what he wants when it comes to Lib Dem economic policy. It was at his instigation that the party <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/jun/08/liberaldemocrats.incometax\">dropped</a> its headline-friendly support for a 50% top rate of income tax two years ago. But his desire for a rethink on local income tax really does appear no more than a question of detail and timing.</p> <p>It is not as if a Lib Dem government would be short of other things to do. Conventional wisdom says the party has no policies, but the reverse is true. The long decades out of power at Westminster have left it with a whole alternative universe of policy. That universe is a pleasant place to live \u2013 in it Britain has been playing a central role in Europe for 50 years and cherishing the environment for more than 30 \u2013 but the party is not always clear about the mechanics of bringing the real one more into line with it.</p> <p>So if Cable believes something as fraught as reform of local government finance is better treated as a medium-term objective, no one should get too excited. Besides, if the Liberal Democrats want to place ourselves firmly on the side of the poor, maybe we should be in favour of property taxation?</p> <p>I was a newly elected Liberal Alliance councillor back in 1986 when the Thatcher government began consulting over the introduction of the poll tax.<br>Conservative members didn't want it phased in over 10 years: they wanted it at once. You could see the pound signs in their eyes as they calculated how much they and their neighbours would save.</p> <p>As a dutiful Liberal \u2013 it was party policy even then \u2013 I moved an amendment calling on my council to support a local income tax in its reply to the consultation. After it was voted down, one of the county ladies on the Tory benches came over and asked: \"Do you realise why the rates are unpopular? It's because you can't hire a sharp accountant to get you out of them, the way you can with income tax.\" She was right, and I have had a soft spot for property taxes ever since.</p>",

By the way, I've just looked at one of the many, many bits of paper they hand out in the press box and LeBron and Kobe played identical minutes in the first half...The US coach isn't trying to cope with competing egos, is he??</p> <p><strong>11.20pm</strong> US 51 China 39..and thoughts turn to newspaper piece I have got to write as soon as I have finished this blog.. My mate Matt thinks I should start with the intro \"If Chairman Mao had been buried instead of embalmed he would have been rolling in his grave last night after China was defeated...\" Check the Times for that one in the morning Don't buy it, though. Look over someone's shoulder.</p> <p><strong>11.15pm (That would be Beijing time)</strong> I get the impression from emails that some of you know rather more about basketball than you should. Such as Daniel Lockersten, who writes to explain that FIBA rules disadvantage the USA because \"In the NBA, when a player is in the post, he can defend by placing his hand on the Offensive players back, and use is forearm to help shield him away. FIBA rules allow you only to use your forearm reducing the leverage a player can get. This is a disadvantage because Dwight Howard will probably foul out in the middle of the third quarter..\" Eh?</p> <p>Anyway, game on. The third quarter starts...</p> <p><strong>11.07pm</strong> Speaking of numpties who should not be allowed to be in charge of the TV remote, far less a global superpower, Gareth Davies emails \"I have to rather sheepishly admit that the BBC digital multichanel service IS showing the game. Finally i discover the reason for all the excitement about \"the red button\".\" Cheers Gareth for making me look even more ridiculous than I already am.</p> <p><strong>11pm (Beijing time)</strong> Half-time and its the USA 49 China 37. Here are some general thoughts. China have done about as well as expected, probably a bit better, largely because of Yao. But one man can't beat five on his own, especially when the other five include LeBron James. He's scored 11 points thus far and has struck about the same number of Chris Eubank poses. He's a cocky sod, but, geez, he is good; athletic, strong and determined. What a player. If I was the Chinese coach, I would rest Yao for most of the second half and save him for games the Chinese need to win to get through to the quarters. Now if you will excuse me for a couple of minutes while I must nip along and give Dubya a slap on the ear for all that nonsense in Iraq.</p> <p><strong>10.53pm</strong>USA 49 China 36. BBC election night impersonation alert! With one minute and three seconds of the second quarter remaining the Guardian Blog is about to call the result of this game. USA wins!! Oh well, it was nice while it lasted.</p> <p><strong>10.50pm</strong> It's now 35-29 to the US. More importantly, the tarzan cheerleaders are back out, only this time they're dressed in green bikinis. Yeuch. And they're dancing to classical music. Double yeuch. Yao looks knackered and no wonder. He's holding this together. I really, really fear for the Chinese if he goes off for an extended period of time. My mate Matt from the Times here has made a good point (for once in his life)..This USA team really is LeBron's team. Odd, given that Kobe is the man (as we used to to say back in the hood in Stirlingshire).</p> <p><strong>10.45pm</strong> Gareth Davies writes \"Why are the BBC showing repeats of a rainy cycling race instead of this clash of civilisations!\". Gareth, if knew that I would be pulling down 400 grand a year as the Director General of the BBC instead of trying to write a blog and watch a game of basketball at the same time..oh, its now 31-29 to the USA. Lots of exciting stuff, most of which I missed because I was reading emails.</p> <p><strong>10.41pm</strong> Second quarter starts with a three-pointer for China. USA come back with four straight points. No Yao on the court. I wonder if he's not quite fit. This is beginning to look a little bit ominous.</p> <p><strong>10.36pm (Beijing time)</strong> End of the first quarter and its the USA 20 China 16. Here are some general thoughts. I'll keep it simple for those with limited basketball knowledge, such as me. This really is quite exciting. There's an artistic dance troupe on the court right now. No offence, but where are the cheerleaders in the tarzan outfits??</p> <p><strong>10.33pm</strong> 16-16. China back in the game thanks to some nifty ball-handling and shooting by the point guard Chen Jianhau. Lots of complaining from the US bench about the referring...stop it, please.</p> <p><strong>10.27pm (Beijing time)</strong> Mmmm. Dunks by LeBron and Dwiight Howard and a three by Kobe and all of a sudden its 16-11 USA.</p> <p><strong>10.20pm</strong> China 11 USA 9. Time out called by the Chinese and here come the cheerleaders...anyway..back to the game...It's a messy affair thus far with lots of turn-overs and an absolutely shocking air ball by LeBron James. Yao is playing as if his life depended on it, blocking shots, setting screens, hitting his shots. He can't keep this up for 40 minutes...can he?</p> <p><strong>10.15pm (beijing time)</strong> Tip-off. US wins the ball. But loses it and...Yao shoots a three-pointer. I'll say that again for anyone who I'm joking: Yao shoots a three-pointer. The last time Yao shot a three-pointer Mao was the left-winger in Chinese communist party under-11 football team.</p> <p><strong>10.12pm</strong> Dubya's here. I can't see him but I can see lots of stern-faced men in black with their fingers to their ear and mysterious bulges under the jackets. I wonder what they do for a living?</p> <p><strong>10.05pm (Beijing time)</strong> Ten minutes to go and no sign of Dubya. Time to introduce the team. Yao gets the biggest cheer of the Chinese team but - get this - Kobe Bryant gets a louder cheer than Yao. Carlos Boozer gets booed.</p> <p><strong>9.57 (Yes, Beijing time)</strong> It might just be me, but it looks like the Americans are larking about in the warm-up. A bit cocky, if you ask me, although looking at the fresh-faced and distinctly smaller Chinese team they can probably afford to be cocky. Stand by for an avalanche of men-against-boys analogies.</p> <p><strong>9.52pm</strong> Oh oh. Here come the Yanks and the place has...gone mental. They love their basketball, the Chinese. Which gives me the chance to show off the results of my extensive pre-game research. Did you know that 300 million play the game in China, which is more than the population of the USA?</p> <p><strong>9.41pm (Beijing time)</strong> Yao Ming has just led the Chinese team out for the warm-up and the place has gone mental. Hair standing up on the back of the neck time. The crowd is cheering practice lay-ups like they're windmill dunks in the last seconds of the NBA finals. Maybe someone should tell them it won't be this easy when the game starts.</p> <p><strong>9.38pm (Beijing time)</strong> Croatia have beaten Australia. Hurrah! As in hurrah that's finished, now let's get on with the big game. But first some new from the press box, where a bloke from Germany is arguing with a bloke from Argentina over the last available seat. There is but 30-something minutes to tip-off and the question on everybody's lips is: what exactly is in those sausages on a stick? Actually, I'm lying; the question of the moment is \"Where will G Dubya and Ho Jintao sit?\"</p> <p><strong>9.20pm (Beijing time)</strong> Aggh. I forgot to say that the 9.18pm entry was at 9.18pm Beijing time. I guess I was distracted by the cheerleaders.</p> <p><strong>9.18pm Cheerleader Update!</strong> In a sensational development on the eve of the biggest sporting event in Chinese history a troupe of blonde-haired, Farah Fawcett-type cheerleaders have just wandered on to the court. Very fetching, too, in their Jane (as in the close friend of Tarzan) outfits.</p> <p><strong>9.11pm (Beijing time)</strong> The boss has just called from London to tell me to type in that all times are \"Beijing\" times. Rookie mistake. Anyway Croatia are still beating Australia, not that anyone within 50 miles of this building cares.</p> <p><strong>8.56pm</strong> I'm new to this live blogging lark so forgive me if I don't get the tone and style right. I was, ahem, being wittily self-deprecating when I said I didn't know the difference between FIBA and NBA rules.., but thanks anyway to Sternslovchild for that helpful and extremely tedious link. Anyway, back to the basketball arena, where Croatia are beating Australia 52-43 and a bloke from the half-time acrobatic team fell on his head and had to be helped off the court.</p> <p><strong>8.15pm (two hours before tip-off)</strong>Decided against sausage-on-a-stick for dinner and had a meal in a restaurant near the arena. Very nice too, even if we didn't know what we ordered and the waiters gathered round to laugh at us as we drank from our finger bowls. The rain was lashing down as we headed back but it didn't dampen the entrepreneurial spirit of the local touts. \"Pssst. Want tickets mate? Got two together three rows behind Ho Jintao and Dubya,'' one of them asked me. Or at least that's what I think he said.</p> <p><strong>Preamble</strong> \"Eagerly anticipated\" is one of those phrases journalists use when they can't think of anything original to write, or when they want an excuse to let the bosses know they arrived 12 hours before a sporting event just to make sure they get a seat in the press box.</p> <p>So let me begin by saying this: tonight's Olympic basketball match between China and the United States is the most eagerly anticipated sporting contest in Chinese history. I know this because - attention bosses - I arrived at the Olympic basketball stadium at 9.45am Beijing time this morning to get a seat and compile a list of eight things you should know before tonight's tip-off.</p> <p>1. The Chinese public appear to be crazy about basketball. The arena was packed when I got here just after breakfast. For Russia and Iran! 2. The food at the concession stands in the arena is - how can I say this politely? - limited: bags of crisps, Snickers bars and little sausages on sticks. Mmmmm. 3. Yao Ming, the star of the Chinese basketball team, arrived at noon and watched most of the Germany versus Angola match from the VIP section. He is very, very tall indeed, even when he is sitting down. 4. <a href=\"http://deadspin.com/5035136/the-george-w-bush-female-athlete-inspection-continues\">This chap</a> will be at tonight's game, assuming he drags himself away from the beach volleyball. 5. The United States team better not kid themselves they only have to turn up to win the gold medal. Greece played Spain in one of the afternoon matches and both looked capable of given LeBron and friends a decent game. 6. Tonight's game will be played under FIBA rules, which are markedly different from those applied in the NBA. This will be a disadvantage for the Americans, apparently, and hopefully someone reading this will send me an email explaining why. 7. Tonight's game will also feature Chinese cheerleaders, who are markedly different from NBA cheerleaders in that none of them have Farah Fawcett hair. 8. The US will win by a country mile because they have four great players and China has one.</p> <p>Now, if you'll excuse me I'm off to have a wholesome meal of Snickers and sausage on a stick before game time. Join me again just before tip-off.</p> <p>Post your thoughts and questions to Lawrence below, or you can email him at <a href=\"mailto:lawrence.donegan@guardian.co.uk\">lawrence.donegan@guardian.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>How much is the west, and specifically the US, to blame for the war between Russian and Georgia?</p> <p>Quite a lot, according to some commentators, who happen to be American. Steve Clemons at Washington Note sees a <a href=\"http://www.thewashingtonnote.com/archives/2008/08/georgiarussia_c/\">\"high quotient of American culpability\"</a>.</p> <p>He argues that when Kosovo declared independence earlier this year, the price of Russian cooperation on other global issues rose considerably and that chances of a clash over Georgia's breakaway border provinces increased dramatically.</p> <blockquote> <p>By pushing Kosovo the way the US did and aggravating nationalist sensitivities, Russia could in reaction be rationally expected to further integrate and cultivate South Ossetia and Abkhazia under de facto Russian control and pull these provinces that border Russia away from the state of Georgia ...</p> <p>At the time, there was word from senior level sources that Russia had asked the US to stretch an independence process for Kosovo over a longer stretch of time - and tie to it some process of independence for the two autonomous Georgia provinces. In exchange, Russia would not veto the creation of a new state of Kosovo at the security council. The US rejected Russia's secret entreaties and instead rushed recognition of Kosovo and said damn the consequences.</p> </blockquote> <p>However, it could be argued that Russia and Georgia were heading for a clash over South Ossetia, with or without Kosovo independence, as the issue has been simmering for years. </p> <p>Vladimir Putin, the Russian president turned prime minister, in his public statements seemed to put more importance on Georgia's ambitions to join Nato. At its summit in Bucharest this year, <a href=\"http://www.nato.int/issues/nato-georgia/index.html\">Nato agreed that Georgia would become a member</a> of the western military alliance, which would not have gone down well with the Kremlin.</p> <p>What is not in dispute is that Georgia's president, Mikheil Saakashvili, overplayed his hand or walked into a Russian trap, but that is almost besides the point. James Sherr, an analyst at the Chatham House thinktank, argues that what the episode shows is Russia's determination to protect its owns interests whatever it takes. <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/2531270/Georgia-Russia-demands-to-be-regarded-as-number-one.html\">He writes in the Sunday Telegraph.</a></p> <blockquote> <p>... Russia has (in Putin's words) \"earned a right to be self-interested\" and that in its own \"zone\", it will defend these interests irrespective of what others think about them. For Russia, the broader implications are also becoming straightforward. To its political establishment, to the heads of Gazprom and Rosneft, to its armed forces and security services and to their advisors and \"ideologists\", the key point is that the era of western dominance is over.</p> </blockquote> <p>On Politico, Ben Smith looks at how Barack Obama and John McCain, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0808/12409.html\">the two US presidential hopefuls have reacted to the crisis</a>. He notes that Obama took a very mainstream position, calling for negotiations, but that McCain took a much more confrontational stance towards Russia. Smith concludes that McCain's position \"put him more closely in line with the moral clarity and American exceptionalism projected by President Bush's first term\". Of course now in the last days of his presidency, Bush has become much more pragmatic. The \"axis of evil\" rhetoric has been jettisoned and the US is talking to both North Korea and Iran.</p>",
  "<p>Police investigations, commissions of inquiry examining the errors committed during the Lebanon war of 2006, repugnance at former president <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moshe_Katsav\">Moshe Katsav</a>'s alleged sex crimes, and now prime minister Ehud Olmert's announcement that, with charges of corruption swirling about him, he will resign in September: all of this suggests profound wounds in Israel's moral tissue. </p> <p>Old Israelis like myself are stupefied by the scope and scale of today's corruption and the multiplying investigations. Is corruption something that has always existed here but was somehow hidden until now? Are we learning of it because our prosecutor and police are bolder and better equipped nowadays? </p> <p>I do not believe that corruption is coming to light just because law enforcement is somehow better, or because citizens, like the presidential staff who accused President Katsav of sexual crimes and harassment, are more courageous. What is coming to light is a much deeper evil, a loss of values within Israeli society and its government, such as never existed before. </p> <p>This moral deterioration is most prominent in the behaviour of today's accused, who are much more impudent and aggressive than in the past. I remember how in the 1970's, when suspicion of corruption arose with respect to a Labour party minister, the minister took his own life. So did a director of a great bank, a brilliant economist, when he was suspected of financial crimes. </p> <p>When <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinchas_Sapir\">Pinchas Sapir</a>, prime minister Golda Meir's finance minister died, all that he owned was a modest apartment in Tel Aviv and some small savings. David Ben Gurion, Israel's founder and most prominent political personality, spent the last 11 years of his life living in a little wooden house in the desert kibbutz Sde Boker. Today, that house's extreme modesty still surprises visitors.<br> Former Prime Minister Menachem Begin also lived until his death in a simple apartment in Tel Aviv. Not the smallest shadow of the slightest suspicion of corruption ever disturbed his peace. </p> <p>True, corruption has also become more common in other countries in recent years, and many democracies are stained by links between politics and finance. Economic interests are supplanting ideology as the motor of politics, and money serves as the key instrument in elections. But how is it that Israel, which only a few years ago was hardly touched by fraud and corruption, is now swept by them? </p> <p>The recent episodes of corruption, I believe, are rooted in the division, beginning in 1967, of two altogether distinct sets of norms and values. On the one hand, the moral and jurisdictional principles of the democratic state have continued to be applied in Israel in accordance with the tradition of the rule of law. On the other hand, in the Palestinian territories, a new system of values has been progressively established. </p> <p>These two systems operate side by side, but the border that separates them has gradually become more porous, and the open breaches in it have become ever greater. Unlike colonial states, in which colonisers came from distant metropolises (and only in small numbers) the Palestinian territories are just across the border from Israel. </p> <p>In the West Bank the organs of jurisdiction operate in a completely different way. Palestinian lands are illegally confiscated. Jewish settlers act outside the law and commit provocative acts harming Palestinians, rarely incurring any penal sanctions. Injustice and exploitation are an everyday occurrence, justified by references to security or the ideology of Greater Israel. </p> <p>The boundaries between the two types of legalities could not remain impenetrable forever. Little by little, the state of occupation, which should have been temporary, became a stable reality, and the policy of creating Israeli settlements in the heart of the Palestinian population strengthened the connection between Israel and the occupied territories. The norms of a colonial and militarist regime have begun to infiltrate the governing organs of Israel's democracy, perverting their proper activities. Politicians, functionaries, army officials \u2013 usually coming from the right \u2013 introduced into Israeli political life the disgraceful norms in force in the occupied territories. So corruption has grown. </p> <p>Fortunately, Israel's judicial system remains independent and rests on foundations of proven integrity. The presence of many women in the magistrature and the police has also contributed significantly, in my view, to reinforcing the system. But when inadmissible norms become tolerated in silence, even the strongest juridical system becomes destabilised. </p> <p>Nor should we forget that the global economy, with which Israel is deeply integrated, creates infinite and complex opportunities for financial crimes. </p> <p>In these conditions, a strong judicial system and police force do not always suffice to contain corruption. The support of public opinion is also needed. </p> <p>I have the impression that the latest disturbing allegations of corruption among politicians and state functionaries have awakened Israel's citizens from their stupor. They are now demanding that the rule of law and justice return to their central place in public life. Of course, the true test will be whether such demands are reflected in September's parliamentary election. </p> <p><strong>Copyright: <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org\">Project Syndicate</a>, 2008.</strong></p>",
  "<p>It was an excruciating evening for the British women's gymnastics team in Beijing. The group were forced to watch - huddled together in the stands - as rival countries decided their fate after the team put in a poor qualifying performance earlier in the day. A place in the team final, plus two individual places for Beth Tweddle and Rebecca Downie in the uneven bars and the all-around individual final, were at stake.</p> <p>The team had been hoping to make an Olympic final for the first time in their history, but the results of their qualifying session left them precariously placed in fifth position at the halfway point of the day. It went down to the wire with France's team performance on the last apparatus the deciding factor. In the end France nailed it, squeezing Britain into ninth place - just 0.75pts short of making history.</p> <p>It was not all bad news though, a ninth place qualifying finish was a record for Britain's women's team and there was better news for Beth Tweddle and Becky Downie in the individual events.</p> <p>Earlier in the day Tweddle had left the National Indoor Stadium in tears; Britain's best ever gymnast and world champion on the uneven bars in 2006 faced an agonising five-hour wait to find out whether she would make it through to the finals of what many believe could be her last Olympics. Tweddle had faltered on her speciality apparatus, the uneven bars, losing two crucial points. Going into the last qualifying session of the day her score of 15.650 left her in eighth and final place for the individual competition.</p> <p>In the end she managed to hang on, but it will take some confidence-building for the former world champion to regain her composure and fulfill her dreams of winning an Olympic medal next Monday (11.45am BST).</p> <p>Commonwealth bronze medallist 16 year-old Becky Downie qualified for her first ever Olympic final in the all-around individual competition in 24th place; she competes at 4.15am BST on Friday.</p> <p>The Great Britain head coach Colin Still had been bitterly disappointed with the performances of Tweddle and his team. \"There was more in the tank and they never released it,\" he said. \"Training had gone well, but out there I thought they produced maybe 10% less than what they had trained. Hopefully [in the final] they'll release what they can achieve and then we'll see. They are inexperienced and I think it was nerves that got to them.\"</p> <p>Britain had been under pressure from the start, as they began their rotation on the vault with 16 year-old Hannah Whelan missing her landing to end up on her rear. Imogen Cairns did well to recover focus for the team but more trouble was to follow on the uneven bars. Both Downie and Tweddle underperformed and from there on, despite good and consistent scores, there was just too much to do. As Japan - unexpectedly - held their own, a tough battle emerged between the two nations to clinch fourth place in the midway stage. Japan won out by just 0.75pts. Australia, Russia, Brazil and France all qualified ahead of Britain after that and there was no way back.</p> <p>The results for the other competing countries were also by no means straightforward. The USA - much hyped favourites to win big in Beijing boosted by their star performer 16-year-old Shawn Johnson, current world all-around champion - had expected to qualify in pole position. Instead China took that honour 1.475pts ahead, although Johnson qualified as best individual all-around, with Russia showing their strength by finishing hot on the heels of the US in third place by just 2.4pts.</p> <p>China, hoping to reclaim their global team dominance after losing to the USA in last year's world championship finals, had romped into the overall lead, but they too were not without individual errors. He Kexin lost her grip on the uneven bars and fell in a mistake that shocked the crowd. There were tears as the group huddled round the diminutive gymnast, shielding her from the TV cameras.</p> <p>Within the US team it will be interesting to watch who comes out on top in the finals - with Johnson and Nastia Luikin battling it out for the all-around title having qualified in first and second place. It will be a battle of styles old and new as Liukin, daughter of former Soviet union Olympic champion Valeri and rhythmic champion Anna Kotchneva, with her slim legs and elegant lines, takes on the new breed of powerhouse pocket rockets such as Johnson.</p> <p>Despite a convincing qualifying result, the Americans too had their share of disaster. On the uneven bars, 2005 all-around world champion Chellsie Memmel suffered a fall and Liukin crashed as she landed. Worse still Samantha Peszek, who had been scheduled to compete on all four apparatus, strained her ankle in the warm up and was only able to compete on the uneven bars, a development which was said to have badly affected team spirit.</p> <p>With China, USA and Russia separated by less than four points at the top, the team final on Wednesday (3.30am BST) looks likely to be one of the tightest fought competitions in recent years.</p>",
  "<p>When personal finances are being squeezed by rising prices and economic fears, debates about bills of rights could seem irrelevant. But it is at such times that the lack of agreed values is most felt. As the experience of other countries shows, a national bill of rights, articulating fundamental rights and freedoms, can be a powerful statement of that society's aspirations. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/parliamentary_committees/joint_committee_on_human_rights.cfm\">Joint Committee on Human Rights</a> (JCHR) today publishes its report, <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt200708/jtselect/jtrights/165/165i.pdf\">A Bill of Rights for the UK (pdf)</a>? In it, we conclude that the UK needs a modern bill of rights and freedoms, to capture the best of our traditions and reflect our aspirations for the future.</p> <p>The purpose of the classic bills of rights \u2013 Magna Carta in 1215, France's Declaration of the Rights of Man in 1789, and the American Bill of Rights of 1791 \u2013 was to protect the individual's liberty against the intrusive power of the overbearing state. Liberty was conceived in the negative: an absence of restraint. </p> <p>In the middle of the 20th century, however, conceptions of liberty and human rights began to change. <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/history/presidents/fr32.html\">President Roosevelt</a>, whose interventionist New Deal rescued the US from the Great Depression, redefined freedom to include not merely absence of restraint but absence of want and fear. Liberty now included the right to economic security.</p> <p>In our modern parliamentary democracy, a bill of rights should combine these two human rights traditions.</p> <p>Of course, any modern bill of rights should include our traditional rights, such as trial by jury. It should protect against intrusive state surveillance without justification and safeguards. It should also include more recent concepts, like fair administrative decisions and equality.</p> <p>However, it should also incorporate new economic and social rights such as health, housing, education and an adequate standard of living. The civil and political rights we already enjoy are pretty meaningless in the face of destitution, homelessness or appalling health. When constituents come to my advice surgeries, claiming their \"human rights\" are being infringed, their problems are usually about health, housing, education or benefits \u2013 not currently recognised as \"human rights\" at all! Whilst such expectations might be integral to our way of life, they lack the justified recognition of fundamental individual rights. As <a href=\"http://www.constitutionalcourt.org.za/site/judges/justicealbiesachs/index1.html\">Justice Albie Sachs</a> of the South African constitutional court told the JCHR, a country that does not include economic and social rights in its bill of rights is a country that has \"given up on aspiration\". </p> <p>There is also a powerful case to include the right to a healthy and sustainable environment, and for specific recognition of particularly vulnerable groups such as children, disabled people, minorities, workers (including migrants) and crime victims.</p> <p>A bill of rights enshrining these additional rights would be a real advancement on the <a href=\"http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts1998/ukpga_19980042_en_1\">Human Rights Act</a>. Yet this need not compromise our tradition of parliamentary democracy. The Human Rights Act is a parliamentary model of human rights protection. Courts have an important role, but parliament has the final say. </p> <p>Our new bill of rights could build on this unique relationship between the courts and legislature. It could provide, for example, that economic and social rights are not directly enforceable by individuals against the government, but make it the government's duty to achieve the progressive realisation of those rights, with a limited role for the courts to review the measures taken. </p> <p>A bill of rights should be a statement of the rights and freedoms to which everyone in the UK is entitled, and not dependent on the fulfilment of certain responsibilities or duties. In this era of globalisation and corporate power, when the state increasingly relies upon the private and voluntary sector to discharge its functions, and people expect choice over their provider of state services, a modern bill of rights should apply to private entities performing public functions. </p> <p>A UK bill of rights should protect the vulnerable against the powerful. As well as reining in intrusive state power, it should oblige the government to address sidelined issues such as older people's vulnerability in residential accommodation or the education of children in detention. Social housing residents, older people in residential accommodation, patients receiving NHS care, disabled people arranging services through direct payments \u2013 they could all then rely on their human rights, even if their provider is private. </p> <p>It would empower people to protect their environment against the polluting effects of big business. And in uncertain economic times, it would ensure that government is reminded of its responsibility to protect our social and economic security.</p> <p>A UK bill of rights can provide the glue that binds us together as a cohesive society, united by a formal restatement of the values underpinning our beliefs and way of life, which makes us both what we are as a nation and what we aspire to be. It can contain the set of rights and freedoms that guide our responses to the challenges we face, from global economic insecurity, to international terrorism, to climate change. It can release the potential of our traditions to transform our future, rather than root us in the past. </p> <p>There is an unprecedented consensus in this country about the need for a modern bill of rights. It is an opportunity that should not be missed.</p>",
  "<p>We don't have room in print for all your letters and blog pingbacks, but do here. Energy policy turns out not to be so boring after all...</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/jul/31/motoring.energy\">LITHIUM FUTURES</a> Electricity as it exists in most countries is a highly polluting form of energy. It is clean at the point of use (which is why you, Panorama and lots of other people presumably think it is environmentally friendly) but mostly it is generated using fossil fuels - and this is the problem. Somewhere, typically miles away from the user, is a power station belching out CO2 and NOx. Typically, electricity is no more than 20% efficient because of losses in the power station and distribution losses so 80% is wasted. So it is worse than gas and an electric car is far worse, for example, than a diesel in terms of CO2 emissions expressed as grams/km. So please stop perpetuating the myth that electricity is a clean fuel. Global warming is such an important topic that the public deserve to be well informed. John Miles, Professor School of Engineering, Cardiff University</p> <p>&gt;&gt; A lot of time and blather is being spent trying to figure out what the car of the future will run on.

A powerful assist could come from a sharp reduction in the cost of making those lithium-based batteries--that would make the cost of developing and manufacturing the vehicles significantly cheaper, and therefore less risky to the carmakers. <a href=\"http://www.plentymag.com/blogs/edge/2008/07/green_car_round_up.php\">plentymag.com</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/jul/31/microsoft.windows\">MOJAVE</a> &gt;&gt; Microsoft's 90% stranglehold on operating systems is perfectly OK on the trust-o-meter, even though it gives Europe fits. Which would be all right, if it were any damned good. But Microsoft's operating system underpins a whole menagerie of functionalities that don't function -- at least not well. What can be said about a system so vulnerable that it writes pothole-filling patches at the rate of 60 last year alone? Five a month?

I can understand that the user statistics are interesting to you, but there are better choices than bit.ly, which has two major flaws. First, using mixed upper and lower-case letters means I can't read and memorise the short form then type it into my browser. Second, if I set up a bookmark to bit.ly, the webpage which appears has an additional \"/go\" appended, so I can't just type the short URL on the end. XRL is worse. It replaces the bookmarked URL by an entirely different one which doesn't accept the short URL at all. Notlong is also out, since you have to type the short URL before \"notlong.com\". In short, if you don't like TinyURL, only Qurl, ElfURL and SnipURL (not in fact case-sensitive, as far as I can tell) are really user-friendly. Please, please consider using one of these! Romilly Bowden, Bognor Regis [<em>In response, we're creating simpler URLs with bit.ly - Tech.Ed</em>]</p> <p>&gt;&gt; I remember several years ago when the right answer to this was given wrong on University Challenge; but you'd think that, after all this time, The Guardian's Technology section would know what URL stands for. Tip: it's uniform, not universal. <a href=\"http://devilgate.org/blog/2008/07/31/whats-that-stand-for/\">devilgate.org</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/jul/24/news.computing\">CAN TOUCH THIS</a> With regards your discussion on whether or not touchscreen technology will take over from the mouse (or keyboard) you did not even touch (excuse the pun) on the reason touch technology has become so popular. This (in my humble option) is simply down to the emergence of \"cheap\" multi-touch displays. Multi-touch has lead to a slate of new ideas on how one can interact with modern technology, with computers unusually being one of the last to join in on this new approach (phones are way ahead at the minute) mainly for practical reasons which are currently being addressed. I agree with you when you say it is unlike to over take the keyboard in most workplace environments (at least in the near future), given you can already use your 10 fingers to work with a keyboard. This is the subtle difference between why I see touch becoming a \"mouse-killer\" and not a keyboard-killer. A mouse is so annoying and I don't know about you but it gives me a terrible pain the my \"mouse-finger\"! A touchscreen display (with an adjustable arm to move it closer to you and into a suitable position) would be far more superior given with multi touch you would now have 10 pointers to manipulate the screen rather than just the one with the mouse (imagine using a keyboard with one finger,annoying!!!). When the hardware and software is in place to take advantage of multi=touch on a PC, the touchscreen will be a \"mouse-killer\" which is already taking over accessible areas like handheld devices (i.e. mobile phones &amp; laptops). I could go on further about were I see it being used in workplaces and the likes but I won't as I've written enough already!

However, if you go sideways, there are some intriguing parallels to this. Freeing data and knowledge sets allows an individual to come up with and explore new ideas. It also means that potentially some revenue will be lost if there are charges involved.

I shall send a copy of your article to no 10 and ask what the PM intends to do about it. I think Miliband understands what is required slightly better than Brown. John Ellis, Llandysul</p> <p>Good letter, and similar to one my father wrote to me thirty years ago. This is the galling thing, all this has been known about for decades. I picked up a geography text book printed in '84 just recently and it pinpointed all the human problems back then, about which we have done virtually nothing: overfishing, habitat destruction, overpopulation, finite material sources, water care. The list is scary. Personally I've never had much truck with a society that puts consumerism at the top of the list and from which our wealth is apparently subservient to and quite frankly, being a bit of a part-time doom merchant, I'm reasonably happy this is all kicking off at last. After the Twin Towers were dropped one of the first things [George] Bush said was, \"keep on spending\". It rather gave the game away. You're right about [David] Cameron. Silly me, I wrote to the Tories five years back that they had to absorb environmental policies to get anywhere, so sucking the life out of the Greens and Liberals. And Labour has been such a crashing failure I find myself in a situation where I am considering a vote for the blues next time around. Saying that I shall have to sign off anonymously. Paul Scott, Eastbourne</p> <p>Finally someone who speaks a bit of common sense. We should have been acting 10 - 15 years ago on this issue. We have the greatest 'natural' resources in wind and sea power and refuse to utilise them. David Alford (no post town given)</p> <p>Why doesn't the government want individuals to generate their own energy? Because if all of us were generating our own energy from solar imagine how much revenue the government would lose from the decline in profits from the energy companies. Unless of course they come up with some clever way of taxing us for sunlight........... Paul Wake, London</p> <p>Great article, it's a shame you didn't write that to Thatcher/Major when they were destroying our energy infrastructure during their last term. Anthony Burton, Leamington Spa</p> <p>Like your drift, but the fact is that the only real solution is to go largely nuclear, urgently - I'm not against solar panels or tidal barriers, but wind farms are ugly, low-yield and pathetically unreliable. You need to be a bit more realistic in advising the \"immovable object\" on what has to be done. Investment should be put into finding a best-of-breed solution for nuclear waste storage/recycling/etc, which is the only issue worth addressing on energy policy. Oh, and the planners need to be told to stop forcing builders to install gas-fired central heating (!) and to insist on electrically-driven systems. Brian Crabtree (no post town given)</p> <p>May I just add a few thoughts to your brilliant article (I genuinely hope Gordon Brown will read it). Simply swapping coal-fire plants to renewable/green energy sources will not be enough solve the UK's energy-problem. It is the culture and the attitude that should be changed, while installing alternative energy sources. This country has been generous with energy since the industrial revolution. Once the UK was abundant in coal, wood, cheap labor in the colonised territories and industrial goods imported from its colonies. But the good, old days are over and British people seem not to realise it. Almost half of the food we buy ends up in the bins [and] Jeremy Clarkson, prophet of fuel-burning is more popular and known than any scientists or activist who design or promote green energy. Buying dirt-cheap clothes from Primark and not thinking about the consequences (where the clothes come from and who suffers from the consequences) is acceptable and a norm. Wasting energy is the very part of the UK's culture and lifestyle. I came to the UK to fulfill my dream, to study music and become a musician. After two years of living here I am full of fury and anger. You have choices and alternatives which I do not have where I am from (Hungary): with my partner we use eco-detergents and washing powder, switch of electrical devices before leave home, use public transport instead of cars, will change energy provider soon, etc. Most people in London, where I live, never get to this stage. It is the culture of 'I-want-it-and-I-want-it-now-whatever-the-price-is'. It is the culture of the Beckhams, Rooneys and Jordans. I work with poor, young people who want cars advertised on TV, fancy clothes, iPhones and gadgets. Many of them become criminals to get these goods. Again, I am full of anger. With my partner we will get married soon and want children and it is the British and Western culture that screws up my children's future. Once an excellent Guardian article about green lifestyle stated clearly: positive changes of a society start from the people, never from the government. We should not expect Gordon Brown to save us. The countdown has started and if the British society keeps wasting energy and resources, no wind farms and solar panels will save the UK. Greg Lorincz, London</p> <p>Brilliant! Couldn't have put it better myself!! Brown's only hope is to grasp the nettle and do something decisive on this critical front. Who do you blame most for this mess - the Thatcher dash for gas, energy privatisation and destruction of coal mining? Or the subsequent Labour dithering over nuclear and lack of \"carrot\" for renewables - esp solar. Surely solar panels should now be obligatory on all new housing? Is our planning permissions process so labyrinthine than nothing ever seems to get done? e.g. I remember talking about the prospect of a Severn barrage when I was at school 35 years ago. Can't see it happening until people are actually starving! Are there worthwhile pressure groups people can join? (not just Greens - I want a realistic, coherent national energy policy that includes Nuclear) Are other countries doing much better than us....think I can guess the answer! Do you think new technology can feasibly make coal fired stations Carbon neutral (ish) or is that just wishful thinking? BTW..... How do the French dispose of their nuclear waste? Anyway thanks for an inspiring and thought provoking article. Paul Sherrard, Bath</p> <p>Here are some of the major issues. 1: Energy is the nation's lifeblood and should have its own Minister of State like Defence, Health and Transport. It is quite absurd that with all the challenges to our energy supply, national &amp; international, Energy has been hived off as a subsidiary of the Department of Business, Enterprise &amp; Regulatory Reform. 2: Given that gas supply, like oil, is likely to remain in the hands of private speculators there are vital issues such as the provision of adequate gas storage facilities and the infrastructure to import store &amp; distribute LPG which need urgent review. It is by no means axiomatic that these facilities are best supplied by 'the market'. We do not, for example, expect the transport industry to build our roads. 3: Electricity is a secondary fuel but is of equal or even greater importance to oil and gas in terms of security of supply at the point of use. It is largely generated by carbon-emitting processes - about 70% of our electricity is generated in this way and despite all our efforts to develop renewables is likely to remain thereabouts for the foreseeable future. We therefore need to reduce demand for electricity. 'The market' is unable to achieve this objective. 4: Virtually all our electricity generating capacity will need to be replaced in the next 2/3 decades. Will 'the market' oblige? 5: The major primary fuels available to us for electricity generation are coal (indigenous or imported), gas (ditto) and nuclear. These all have technically feasible but very expensive waste disposal problems (CCS in the case of coal &amp; gas). Are these to be left to 'the market' to resolve? 6: The national electricity grid was built by the nationally owned Electricity Council and is now in the hands of a private company (\"National Grid\") which is responsible for the management &amp; refurbishment of the system including new connections to off-shore wind farms. Who picks up the bill? 7) In the longer term there are possible developments such as solar-generated hydrogen from North Africa which may be best coordinated by the EU but will require major government input. David Hayes, Bristol</p> <p>That was a welcome call for some more visionary leadership, but there is one aspect which needs bringing to the forefront. Invariably articles on energy seem to get trapped into comparing the alternative forms of energy resources and the methods of harnessing them and do not put the use of energy in the context of conservation, recycling and control relative to the need for energy. We have people like E-ON making a case for burning coal on the basis of false claims that otherwise our energy requirements will not be met - virtually trying to blackmail us into accepting their use of coal CO2 energy capture 'or else' - and claiming that energy conservation will not reduce demand sufficiently to avoid enduring reliance on fossil fuels. 'We cannot conserve our way out of the energy crisis or global warming' seems to be their mantra. The truth is that we have simply build our lives around a profligate use of primary energy from fossil fuels that everything is designed without thought of conservation or recycling of heat and power or the use of freely available ambient energy sources. Since in order to survive, let alone enjoy a sustainable civilized way of life, we are going to have to learn to operate within the limits of resources and without spoiling our habitat, we still have to abandon on sustainable energy systems and adapt to the use of infinite clean energy resources, and to simply stop wasting heat and power. The technology is there - it has been keeping space stations operating for years now - but it is not space science, and more importantly after the initial capital investment it is virtually free. Because highly energy efficient products, buildings and processes are relatively new, and there is no established sustainable development industry at this stage, that initial capital investment is going to be relatively expensive. There are no fundamental reasons though why they should be more expensive than current systems - there are no particularly rare or expensive materials or processes involved and most of them are readily available and in use already. As far as buildings are concerned for instance the basic conservation measures of thermal insulation, air-tightness, ventilation control can be met with cheap materials and good detailing - and almost remove the need for space heating altogether and together with the use of energy efficient lighting and equipment reduce heat and power requirements by 70% to 90% - putting the energy demand well within the capability of alternative energy systems. Keith Lodge, Chairman, ECOZEST Ltd, Ruthin</p> <p>&gt;&gt; sensible advice. <a href=\"http://jebin08.blogspot.com/2008/07/energy-in-uk.html\">jebin08.blogspot.com</a></p> <p>&gt;&gt; It will fall on deaf ears no doubt.

Companies holding licenses to operate WiMAX at the moment are simply not showing the imagination and drive of the first Wi-Fi operators which made that technology such a success. The result - people will miss out on technology that really could make a difference to them. Daniel Heery, Alston</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/aug/01/filesharing.tv?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=technology\">TV AND FILESHARING</a> I was shocked to just read your article equating TV show filesharing with music filesharing. It smacks of jumping on the bandwagon and dangerously stoking flames of an issue that is already ridiculously misunderstood and manhandled. It's inaccurate and poorly argued. \"Did you notice how The Dark Knight came out at the same time all over the world?\" It didn't. You argue for half the article that TV filesharing is terrible for creators and TV channels, and then sulkily admit that it may help shows after all. The issues are different. I disagree music piracy has the impact it's hyped to have, but I'll play along for now. With music, you get a lossless copy. With TV shows, you get a TV recording with TV channel icons littered over the screen. So it's not exactly the same product. TV piracy is out of a certain necessity, music is not. You acknowledge that TV has borders, and that's the main reason for most people's piracy. Music is usually released at the same time, so there is less excuse for it. TV piracy does not cause viewing figures to drop. In my real world experience, buzz created by people who've seen a show before it airs on TV has led other to watch. I myself started a long chain of people to have an interest in Lost, back when I first heard about it after seeing a preview on an American DVD I bought. All the people I told about it watched it when it was on terrestrial TV and bought the DVDs, and they told more people. Every show I've pirated, I own the DVD of, and watch on TV when I get the chance. The Battlestar Galactica reboot owes its success to piracy. This is acknowledged by the producers. The people who care enough about TV shows care enough about them to purchase them on DVD and watch them when they come on TV in their country. Last year, and maybe this year, producers admitted they leaked pilots to generate buzz. Why are new shows leaked but somehow episodes of new seasons manage to stay in the can? Piracy would still occur if TV was borderless, but people would download them at a fraction of what they do now. The piracy of TV in the UK would be dramatically reduced if shows were aired simultaneously, and everyone could access legal streaming sites like Hulu. But no, there are artificial borders. The entertainment site Digital Spy has forums, on which one viewer of Heroes created a topic called \"No more downloading\" because the BBC had secured rights to air the new series a couple of days after the US. \"Doctor Who is very popular in the US\". It's also one of the few British programs that US people like to pirate. Why is it popular then? Surely it shouldn't be popular by your estimations of the effect you think piracy has? Your conclusion that there are going to be more reality programmes is possibly correct, but not for the reasons you give. Unfortunately, people still watch them and the credit crunch means channels will have smaller budgets. If they believed people would watch them as much as drama, soaps etc, Channel 4, 5 etc would make all their programmes reality-based. More cost-effective. Nothing to do with piracy. Your ultimate conclusion I agree with, that TV needs to stop with its borders, but most of everything else is inarticulate and going in different directions. You suggest they should release low quality versions so they'll want the DVD... but that happens anyway; anyone who cares enough to download gigabytes of a TV shows will want the DVD. Oh dear.

'Smiley Miley', as the typically imaginative British press have dubbed her, is a long way back.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>03.52am: Stephanie Rice wins gold and sets a new world record</strong> (4:29:45). And she lets off a primal scream/woop as she does it. The Zimbabwean Kirsty Coventry takes silver and Hoff gets bronze. Miley is in 6th - and it's a poor time, well off her best. 'Smiley Miley' lives up to her (awful) nickname - the British press: the best in the world - by giving a very cheerful interview afterwards. She's still got the 200m to look forward to.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>03.58am: Men's Basketball</strong> - Russia beat Iran 71-49, with the naturalised American JR Holden scoring 19 points. That ain't Olympism, surely.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>04.00am:</strong> Zhang Lin gets a huge cheer on the podium - he's the first Chinese man to win an Olympic medal in the pool. The South Korean anthem then blares out for Park Tae-Hwa.</p> <p><strong>Bush Watch:</strong> Word reaches me across the newsdesk that George Bush stumbled in the stands at the Water Cube. Must have been all that overly vigorous flag-waving. If there's a photo of him on his keester, I'll find it.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>04.08am:</strong> It's raining in Beijing, delaying the start of the tennis. But acid showers don't put off the male volleyball players: China beat Austria 2-0.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>04.14am: Team GB</strong> - Chris Cook finishes 7th in the 100m breaststroke semi-final in 1:00:81. It's one second off his personal best and he doesn't make the final. ''I'm just not on form. That time should have been easy for me to do,'' he says afterwards.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>04.19am: Men's handball</strong> Defending champions Croatia beat Spain 31-29.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>04.23am:</strong> I asked for emails to lift my Olympic spirits. Instead I receive this from Tom Stone, who's obviously under the absurd illusion that human rights are more important than Yngling: ''The Beijing Olympics are a disgrace. Don't watch it, don't blog about it, don't acknowledge it is happening - without at least first thinking about what this the world's greatest sport's event is supposed to represent.''</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>04.26: Brit Watch</strong> - Another final in the pool. Britain's women are in lane eight for the 4x100m freestyle relay, the slowest qualifiers. China were the fastest. You make the prediction.</p> <p>I could be mishearing things. The BBC commentators were questioning whether Stephanie Rice was an underwear model or not. Adrian Moorhouse reckons she would be very good at it: \"She is very fit...\"</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>04.32am</strong> Britain are in equal fourth, surpassing all expectations at the half way stage.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>04.34am:</strong> But they've fallen away now. The Netherlands take gold. Silver to the US. Bronze to Australia. Great Britain take a second off the domestic record but even that's not enough to catch the four Dutch ladies cavorting in victory at the end of the pool.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>04.42am: Team GB Archery</strong> - a quarter-final against Japan for the women's team of Naomi Folkard, Charlotte Burgess and five-time Olympian Alison Williamson. Britain lead by two.</p> <p>''The hooter for the timing on the archery is clearly the horn off a 1993 Volkswagen Jetta. It's unmistakeable. I'm surprised Eddie Butler didn't pick up on it,'' says Gareth Bennett.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>04.44am:</strong> An email from far, far away! ''Good Morning you poor soul,'' writes Matt, who I warm to immediately since <em>no one else understands me</em>. ''I'm in Seoul spending a Sunday afternoon watching the Korean Olympic coverage on TV. I can't understand the commentary but it appears Park Tae hwan has won 14 gold medals today; either that or they are showing his 400m race on a constant loop. The commentary was hilarious of the final 25 metres: another 50 and I think the commentator would have soiled himself. Oh, and Korean coverage is making me long for the BBC's.''</p> <p>The BBC coverage has been ... Barry Davies-less so far. And that's not a good thing.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>05.02: Team GB</strong> - It's very close in this one. All level with one end to go. Eddie Butler says the word ''sultry'' for the 9th time - it's hot out east, he seems to be stressing - and there goes the car horn again.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>05.10am:</strong> Team GB make the semi finals of the women's archery, seeing off Japan 201 to 188. A 9, 10, 10 in their last set ended the sultry Japanese resistance. They will now face China at 9am-ish BST.</p> <p>Tired of reading my London-based witterings?

He lays down the gauntlet to Michael Phelps <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/10/phelps_might_truly_be_touched.html\">here</a>.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>05.13am:</strong> What are Asians making of this Chinese Olympics? ''I don't think the Koreans see any problem with China hosting the Olympics or its human rights record or the rampant nationalism on display: the Korean personality is quite similar. I'm convinced they are more concerned with winning more medals than Japan and protesting about USA beef imports,'' says our Korea correspondent, Matt.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>05.22am:</strong> Give just a hint of self-loathing, and the supportive emails positively roll in. ''Don't despair,'' counsels Christian Wolff. ''I'm relying on Guardian updates here in Bangalore, since Indian state TV Doordarshan seems determined to ruin my Olympics experience - despite possessing exclusive national broadcast rights, most of their coverage consists of two elderly gentlemen sitting in a studio re-capping the success of one female badminton player and the failures of the archery team, while completely ignoring any of the LIVE events going on in Beijing...''</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>05.25am:</strong> The gymnastics are in full swing. Tumbles, tinny classical music, impossibly young Chinese girls looking terrified of the consequences of failure... Speaking of the BBC coverage, Victoria Bingham writes: ''Is is just me or do Matt Baker's excitable Geordie mutterings seem wildly out of sync with the grace of the gymnastics. Shouldn't they have him on canoeing or something. He'll be well used to that. That's all they do on Blue Peter, isn't it?''</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>05.30am: Gold for China in the women's 10m air pistol final</strong>. Guo Wenjun takes gold. Russia's Natalia Paderina wins silver with bronze going to Georgia's Nino Salukvadze.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>05.34am: </strong> Andy Bull gets very excited by women's fencing. Read his theatre review <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/10/olympics_zagunis_the_golden_gi.html\">here</a>.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>05.39am:</strong> A missive from Down Under. ''The Aussie commentators seem a bit disappointed that they didn't win three golds in the pool this morning,'' writes Paul Meek in Brisbane, who immediately emphasises that he's a Kiwi. ''Yesterday was the first time they hadn't won a medal on the first day since 1996 - oh, the humanity! And not sure whether Stephanie Rice has been an underwear model, but she did do a bit of modelling for the local FHM earlier in the year.''</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>05.45am:</strong> ''Despite actually being in an Olympic city (Hong Kong) I am also bizarrely reliant on your commentary to keep me up-to-date,'' writes the magnificently monikered Kester Bramley. ''All the action is on free, terrestrial TV but since my building has no aerial I have what Pink Floyd called \"45 channels of shit on the TV to choose from (choose from)\" but no Olympics. I could go out and watch the equestrian events, I suppose - but trottage, or whatever it is called, on a Sunday? Would rather sit by my screen hoping for a blitz of Gary Naylor insights thanks.''</p> <p>Oh, Naylor, Naylor, wherefore art thou, Naylor? It's dawn in London. We expect him soon.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>05.50:</strong> Fencing and judo are continuing apace. To the Beijing University of Technology for the women's badminton (I almost felt like an anchorman just then), where defending champion Zhang Ning of China has recovered from a shaky start to beat Thailand's Salakjit Ponsana in three sets, 21-23, 21-17, 21-7.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>06.00am: Olympic spirit shames world leaders into stopping all wars for good</strong> - Georgia's Nino Salukvadze took bronze in the 10m air pistol final. After putting down her pistol on her final shot, she wiped tears from her eyes and embraced her Russian opponent, Natalia Paderina. \"I've been really nervous,\" she said afterwards. \"Since yesterday I thought we would leave the Games. The Russian political leaders, our political leaders and other state political leaders should sit and talk about this.\"</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>06.05am:</strong> We've made it past 6am and the reward on the BBC is ... well, i'll let Conor O'Kane explain: ''You sit up all night with Rishi Persad, and what's your reward? Adrian bloody Chiles. That's what the license fee is being used on, flying him to Beijing? As if that's not bad enough, he's forgotten the delightful Christine Bleakley from the One show, so we get Hazel Irvine and her massive teeth.''</p> <p>I think it might be bedtime, Conor.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>06.13am:</strong> By all accounts the tennis has finally got underway. It's been a long rain delay, meaning the Murrays won't be playing their first doubles match for a while yet.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>06.16am: Team GB</strong> In the sailing, the 49er races have started. Steve Morrison and Ben Rhodes have three 30 minute races today. They're currently fourth in the opener. Also in Qingdao, Britain's Yngling crew of Sarah Ayton, Sarah Webb and Pippa Wilson are leading from the front.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>06.29am: </strong> Germany beat Angola 95-66 in the men's basketball.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong><strong>06.30am:</strong> Team GB Gymnastics</strong>. Qualification phase - Subdivision 2: GB, Italy, Japan and the US. </p> <p>The shiny-blue-leotarded Great Britain team is warming up for the vault. Remember that Beth Tweddle's hip injury means she will only compete on the asymmetric bars and the floor disciplines.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>06.35am:</strong> Conor O'Kane has had a coffee and comes back for more. He obviously pays attention to his sailing, too. ''One of the 49er class boys in the sailing, Stevie Morrison, hopes his boat's name 'Little Miss Pipe Dream' will prove to be apt. The Dictionary says: 'A pipe dream is a fantastic hope or plan that is generally regarded as being nearly impossible to achieve.' Little Miss Easy Prospect might have been better...''</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>06.40am: Team GB </strong> A good start on the vault for 16-year-old Becky Downie. Her 15.050 is so good it quite literally makes her American opponent cry. </p> <p>In other gymnastics news, the Americans' leotards are awful: garish red, an ugly great big star, the balance is all wrong. The Italians have gone for delightfully classic white with sparkly bits.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>06.52: </strong> Heads up: Former Bluebells bassist Lawrence Donegan will be blogging live from the China v US basketball game at 2pm BST.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>07.00am: Team GB Cycling</strong> - The women's road race is coming up shortly. Nicola Cooke, Emma Pooley and Sharon Laws will take 3 and a half hours to complete the 72km route.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong><strong>07.03am:</strong> Team GB</strong> Ben Rhodes and Stevie Morrison made a solid start in their first 49er class race, finishing fourth in Qingdao.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>07.06am: There's no accounting for taste.</strong> Sean Dickinson emails from Shanghai to dispute my gymnastics analysis: ''Just wanted to wake you up if you weren't already asleep which, judging by your presumably worsening eyesight and taste, is evidenced by your lack of appreciation for yellow stars on skimpy red leotards.''</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>07.11am: Team GB Cycling</strong> The women's road race is go!</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>07.14am: Gymnastics</strong> Rebecca Wing opens on the beam for GB. I'm told it was good. </p> <p>Sean Dickinson is pining for the green fields of Hollyoaks: ''Go Tweddle! She's from my hometown of Chester, and what she did looked impressive to me.''</p> <p>Beth Tweddle's score of 15.65 puts her fourth in the bars - the top eight go through. She hit the bar with one of her feet during her routine, costing her points.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>07.17am: Team GB Yngling</strong> <strong>Sarah Ayton, Sarah Webb and Pippa Wilson are first in the overall standings</strong> after placing fourth in their third race. Holland and Finland follow close behind.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>07.23am:</strong> In the men's Judo (66kg), a showdown between a Russian and a Georgian has been narrowly averted. Miklos Ungvari of Hungary beat the Georgian Zaza Kedelashvili to set up a quarter-final with Russia's Alim Gadanov. The two countries will just have to settle their differences on the battlefield.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>07.30am: Road race</strong> 110.6km to go. The riders are all bunching together. No one's yet made the break. Speaking of breaks, I'm off in 30 minutes. Must...keep...typing....But never fear: Alan Gardner will see you through to the end with a laughably easy three-hour shift.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong><strong>07.34am:</strong> Team GB</strong> News of Ben Ainslie in today's Finn event. He's finished fourth place in race three, which puts him second overall.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>07.38am: Team GB Gymnastics </strong> Sixteen-year-old Hannah Whelan does a jig or two in her floor routine. Folkish violins accompany her smiles and wiggles. Then she attempts some real gymnastics. Oh dear. A stumble. Then a pike. Not bad.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong><strong>07.46am:</strong> Team GB Sailing</strong> Ben Rhodes and Stevie Morrison finish third in the second 49er race. That puts them second overall. One more race to come today.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>07.55am: Team GB Gymnastics</strong> Beth Tweddle's floor routine begins. She needs it to go well. </p> <p>It's decent - 14.950 - but she is unlikely to make the final. Overall, Britain lie fifth after four rotations. Team qualification in the top eight will be struggle. Becky Downie is hovering close to individual qualification but there a lot of women to come.</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>08.13am:</strong> Hello all. Taimour has headed off to stare blankly into space somewhere, and I'll be your Olympic guide for the next few hours. News on Beth Tweddle, and the GB women road racers asap...</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>8.20am: Team GB rowing</strong> Wellity, well, we have a real medal hope to discuss, ladies and gentleman. Zac Purchase and Mark Hunter are going in the mens lightweight double sculls, and they've apparently set their hearts on gold. The pair have started smoothly and are holding a comfortable advantage, with two to go through.</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>8.27am: Team GB rowing</strong> Purchase and Hunter are safely through into the semi-final, winning by a length and only 3.7sec outside the world record. Good start for the boat boys.</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>8.35am: China have picked up another gold</strong>, in the women's synchronised 3m springboard. Guo Jingjing and Wu Minxia, the reigning world and Olympic champions have wrapped things up again. Russia took silver, with Germany collecting bronze.</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>8.45am: We got mail.</strong> And yes, it's the first of the day from Gary Naylor. \"I note from your 7.00am update,\" notes Naylor, \"that 'Nicola Cooke, Emma Pooley and Sharon Laws will take 3 and a half hours to complete the 72km route.' Unless all the competitors are stopping for a pleasant Sunday afternoon picnic with a glass or two of Pimms, I suspect that an average speed of 20km per hour won't secure a medal.\" Well, you know how the British like to do things Gary.</p> <p>In fact, after some <a href=\"http://en.beijing2008.cn/news/sports/headlines/cyclingroad/n214522963.shtml\">rummaging</a>, I can scribble in my official correction highlighter that the women will not be cycling a mere 72km... it'll be more like double that, once they've got up into the mountains (where it's pouring, apparently), and done a wee jaunt along the Great Wall. They're not there yet, though.</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>8.54am: Team GB</strong> Cooke, Pooley and Laws are safely ensconced in the peloton... although they may as well be in the pool, the amount of rain that's washing around their wheels as they head out of Beijing.</p> <p>Meanwhile, <strong>Billy Joe Saunders</strong> has given his opponent, Turkey's Adem Kilicci, an absolute tonking in the welterweight class. He won 14-3, and will fight again next Sunday.</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>8.59am: News from Beijing.</strong> Apparently, such is their hatred for the west*, the Chinese equivalents of Adrian Chiles and Hazel Irvine have started mocking our athletes' weight. \"Watching here in Beijing on TV, my flatmate just informed me that the Chinese commentators amusingly said the British women couldn't succeed in diving because they were too fat,\" emails Nicky Goh. \"To qualify it slightly, they did go on to say that with their weight, it was extremely unlikely they could achieve the necessary body strength to allow for the turning power necessary.\" Oh, that's all right then.</p> <p>*Of course, we know they don't hate us really</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>9.04am: Team GB archery</strong> Eddie Butler's mellifluous tones are telling me about the women archers, who are up against the Chinese. Win, and they're guaranteed a medal; lose, and they'll have to duke it out for bronze. Currently, it's in the balance.</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>9.08am: Team GB rowing</strong> Some more success in the mens lightweight four, where Chambers, Clarke, Lindsay-Fynn and Mattick are through in their heat, coming home behind China.</p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p><strong>9.15am: Team GB archery</strong> At the halfway stage, the British girls trail by just two points, but they need to keep hitting the bullseye to make up ground on their opponents. Interestingly, the announcer in the archery arena appears to be American.</p> <p>Oh, and on that subject, it's the clash of civilisations, sorry, China v USA in the basketball later today, and Lawrence Donegan will be <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/10/china_v_usa_usa_usa_live.html\">blogging about it LIVE</a>. It doesn't start till 3pm, though, so stick with me until then.</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>9.23am: Team GB archery</strong> China will take on the winners of Korea v France for the women's team gold medal. The Brits can still take bronze though, and it's no shame losing to the Chinese, who've won every gold in female arrers since the 1984 Olympics.</p> <p>In the <strong>cycling, the women's team are well positioned out in a very wet road race.</strong> Pooley is right up at the front, and all three managed to avoid a nasty crash that happened a short while ago.</p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>9.32am: Team GB</strong> Ben Ainslie is second in the overall standings in the Finn, having won the fourth race ahead of Zach Railey of the USA. Railey currently heads the field, with a score of 11, but Ainslie is just five points behind on 16 (the lower the better).</p> <p>In the rowing, it's the women's heavyweight quadruple sculls, where China are out in front, with one spot in the final up for grabs. In fact, they're <em>miles</em> out in front...</p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p><strong>9.35am: Team GB rowing</strong> Britain's women's heavyweight four, who are the reigning world champions, will go next against the Germans, with both expected to be China's main oppo in next Sunday's final.</p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>9.39am: Correction corner.</strong> My hideous ignorance of the archery has been revealed. \"I think you'll find it is the South Koreans, not the Chinese, who have won all those women's archery gold medals,\" says Philip Reynolds, all the way from Wellington, NZ. \"And it's not called the bullseye; it's called the gold or (in Olympic archery) the ten.\" I was employing the vernacular, Phil.</p> <!-- Block 80 --> <p><strong>9.43am: Team GB rowing</strong> The women's quadruple scullers are moving well out on the water, putting some deep blue between them and the German team.</p> <!-- Block 81 --> <p><strong>9.45am:</strong> GB being reeled in by Germany, can Grainger and her crew hold on...? Less than 500m to go.</p> <!-- Block 82 --> <p><strong>9.48am: Team GB rowing</strong> There was enough left in the tank and the ladies will take their place in the final. They'll be up, as ever, against the Chinese. You can get some background on Katherine Grainger and the GB quad <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/08/olympicsrowing.britisholympicteam\">here</a>. Sir Steve (Redgrave) reckons they did pretty well out there.</p> <!-- Block 83 --> <p><strong>9.52am: Cycling</strong> There's a Russian out in front in the road race, and she's putting some pressure on the field. The <strong>British trio are still well in contention for a medal</strong>, though. They've been cycling for nearly three hours now.</p> <!-- Block 84 --> <p><strong>9.55am: Team GB rowing</strong> In the lightweight men's quadruple sculls the chaps have pulled hard and qualified in second. I imagine they'll all be off for an erg now, to celebrate.</p> <!-- Block 85 --> <p><strong>10.00am: Team GB cycling</strong> Emma Pooley has made a break on the climb, and she's in a group tailing the Russian, Boyarskaya. Cooke is back in fourth with a strong finish up her sleeve. Hopefully.</p> <!-- Block 86 --> <p><strong>10.05am:</strong> It seems the media centre in Beijing is falling apart. At least the BBC's studio is. A violent squall has halted the women's archery bronze play-off - where we could be looking at a <strong>first medal for Team GB</strong> - and the women's cycling road race is similarly pluvial. But the real drama, as I say, is at BBC hq, where someone has joined Hazel Irvine in the studio holding a bucket. They're crouched discretely behind the sofa... but I can definitely see them holding the bucket.</p> <!-- Block 87 --> <p><strong>10.12am:</strong> Nigeria are playing Japan in the football. I'm backing the Super Eagles there. Hopefully we're going to get a GB medal before long, with real prospects in the cycling and the archery. I'd be reet chuffed to break such news, I can tell you.</p> <p>A Chinese rider has slid into the storm drain in the women's road race. Plenty of names still in the mix... <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/09/longo_joins_elite_group_of_sev.html\">Jeannie Longo-Ciprelli, the oldest lady in the field</a> has just had a go at the front!</p> <!-- Block 88 --> <p><strong>10.19am:</strong> The cyclists have just reached the highest point along the Badaling Great Wall, and with twelve kilometres to go Tatiana Guderzo of Italy is leading.</p> <!-- Block 89 --> <p><strong>10.27am: Medal news.</strong> While we wait for Britain to get on the medal table, Thailand have snapped up their first gold. The improbably named Prapawadee Jaroenrattanatarakoon (or Charoenrattanatharakul if you want to go with the Guardian's Olympic guide) has bossed the field in women's 53kg weightlifting. Apparently she used to be known as Junpim Kantatian, which is altogether less of a mouthfull. Yun Jin-hee of South Korea took silver and Anastassia Novikava of Belarus bronze.</p> <p>Elsewhere, the rowing has been suspended for the day due to the weather.</p> <!-- Block 90 --> <p><strong>10.31am:</strong> 1km to go in the women's road race. Nicole Cooke, fifth in Athens, appears to have lost contact... but apparently she's recovered.</p> <!-- Block 91 --> <p><strong>10.33am: Team GB</strong> Cooke leading with 100m to go.</p> <!-- Block 92 --> <p><strong>10.34am: Team GB GOLD!</strong> Nicole Cooke has claimed the first British medal of Beijing 2008. Some confusion on the broadcast for a moment there, with the Italian Guderzo's name flashing up on screen as the winner... But Cooke is jubilant!</p> <!-- Block 93 --> <p><strong>10.38am:</strong> Cooke, swathed in one of those plastic ponchos you get at festivals, is enjoying this. Several vigorous fist pumps, and the Welshwoman couldn't care a jot about the rain now.</p> <!-- Block 94 --> <p><strong>10.42am:</strong> A big hand should go to Emma Pooley, who finished 23rd, for her earlier efforts in chasing down the leader on the climb. Cooke really seemed to benefit from her team-mates' support, something she lacked four years ago. That's the 200th gold medal at Olympic Games for Great Britain.</p> <!-- Block 95 --> <p><strong>10.45am: Team GB archery</strong> The BBC's rainfall woes in the studio appeared to have been dealt with... and we're off to the Bronze medal match in the women's team archery.</p> <!-- Block 96 --> <p><strong>10.49am:</strong> The clouds are lowering above the archers, as Britain complete their first end (of four) with a score of 48. The French are just behind on 46.</p> <!-- Block 97 --> <p><strong>10.52am:</strong> The American guy on the mic is doing a neat job, as the second end gets under way. He might well be Chinese, of course, with a nifty Yankee drawl, but hey...</p> <!-- Block 98 --> <p><strong>10.55am:</strong> And after the second end, it's all square, 97 each.</p> <!-- Block 99 --> <p><strong>10.56am:</strong> Hold on... one of the French arrows has been remarked, and they're ahead.</p> <!-- Block 100 --> <p><strong>11.01am:</strong> Good start to the third end, with a full ten for GB, but it's still tight as we head towards 18 completed arrows. Six more will decide where this bronze is going. GB: 149 plays France: 150.</p> <!-- Block 101 --> <p><strong>11.03am:</strong> \"Isn't archery just darts for posh people?\" wondered Gary Naylor some time ago. Three arrows left and France look like they're going to sneak it... three points the advantage.</p> <!-- Block 102 --> <p><strong>11.06am:</strong> Nine, 10, eight for GB. France need 25 points to win from three...</p> <!-- Block 103 --> <p><strong>11.08am: France win the bronze medal.</strong> Gah! No success in the women's team archery, then. Two points the margin of victory, and the GB arrer-wielders obviously weren't posh enough. \"No - darts for posh people is d'arts,\" counters Philip Reynolds. Touch\u00e9, Naylor?</p> <!-- Block 104 --> <p><strong>11.12am: Medal ceremony.</strong> Nicole Cooke \"conquered the course and tamed the opposition\", apparently. In fact, she beat them in a bike race. And she's being awarded a gold for her troubles now. Sing with me: \"God save our gracious Queen...\"</p> <!-- Block 105 --> <p><strong>11.18am:</strong> Nigeria have knocked one in against the Japanese to take a 1-0 lead in the football. Sharp side-foot finish in the box by Obinna Nsofor. And Everton's Victor Anichebe has taken the field.</p> <!-- Block 106 --> <p><strong>11.22am: The Cooke report.</strong> So, we've picked up our first necklace of the Games, and it's a shiny gold one to boot. Read about Nicole Cooke's success in the women's road race <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/10/olympics.cyclingroadrace\">here</a>.</p> <!-- Block 107 --> <p><strong>11.31am:</strong> The indomitable Koreans have opened up a lead against the Chinese in the women's team archery final. Meanwhile, the Croatian water polo team reckon the moustaches they have grown for the Olympics will help them go all the way. \"It's for good luck, but we can't talk about it, it's a secret, if I tell you, it will ruin it,\" Igor Hinic told Reuters, ruining his precious secret in one flap of the tongue.</p> <p>Maybe they're right, though. It worked for Mark Spitz, after all. In fact, it's Spitz Day here at Rebranded Website, and we're all sporting handle bars.</p> <!-- Block 108 --> <p><strong>11.35am: South Korea win gold in the women's team archery</strong>, setting a new world record in the process. China will have to settle for silver.</p> <!-- Block 109 --> <p><strong>11.42am:</strong> Dave Godman, meanwhile, has trawled his way right down to the 5.22am entry to concur with Christian Wolff's struggles to comprehend Indian television's coverage of the Games.</p> <p>\"You only watch the Olympics on the state channel here [India] if you have a finely tuned appreciation of surreal farce,\" says Dave, avoiding the opportunity to stick a knee in the ribs of the BBC's (excellent) coverage. \"Eight years ago I watched in a hotel room. Random live visual feeds were appearing on the screen, with no sound commentary. It was left to the two talking heads in the studio to figure out what was going on. At one point a handball game manifested, but neither of the commentators had ever seen a handball game before.\" Them and me both, to be honest.</p> <!-- Block 110 --> <p><strong>11.47am:</strong> Nigeria are 2-1 ahead now. No Joseph Yobo there, of course, because the Nigerian FA forgot to include him in their squad. Much to the delight of Everton fans, presumably.</p> <!-- Block 111 --> <p><strong>11.53am:</strong> Turns out Victor Anichebe scored Nigeria's second, ultimately the winner. Will England regret not calling him up when they still could? It's not like the national set-up is exactly overflowing with confident strikers...</p> <!-- Block 112 --> <p><strong>11.59am: Team GB swimming</strong> Gemma Spofforth and Elizabeth Simmonds have made the semi-finals of the women's 100m backstroke, after finishing 3rd and 4th in their heats respectively.</p> <!-- Block 113 --> <p><strong>12.05pm: Cricket corner.</strong> Steve Harmison has knocked over a couple of wickets in the Test. You can follow the action with Carrie Dunn <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/10/englandsouthafrica.overbyover\">here</a>.</p> <p>Lots of stroking going on at the Water Cube, meanwhile.</p> <!-- Block 114 --> <p><strong>12.10pm: Medal news.</strong> China have another gold, this time <strong>in the women's judo 52kg weight category.</strong> Xian Dongmei beat An Kum Ae of North Korea to retain the title she won in Athens. The crowd quite enjoyed that.</p> <!-- Block 115 --> <p><strong>12.19pm: Team GB swimming</strong> Robbie Renwick from Aberdeen is racing in the men's 200m freestyle. He appears to be in second...</p> <!-- Block 116 --> <p><strong>12.21pm:</strong> Renwick came home in third, and is in with a shout of making the semis. The Baltimore Bullet (surely a more nautical nickname would work better?) Michael Phelps has just flopped into the pool for a lazy 200m of his own. Britain's Ross Davenport is also racing.</p> <!-- Block 117 --> <p><strong>12.27pm:</strong> Phelps, sans tache, finishes in second, but is surely saving himself for the crunch. Davenport was sixth.</p> <p>Turns out no one else on the desk has gone with the spirit of Mark Spitz Day, and I'm the only one who turned up with a stylish facial accoutrement. Bah.</p> <!-- Block 118 --> <p><strong>12.35pm: Medal news. Japan have taken gold in the men's 66kg judo</strong>, Masato Uchishiba triumphing against Benjamin Darbelet of France.</p> <p><strong>Team GB swimming</strong> Despite his third place, Robbie Renwick's slower heat has meant he will not be in the semis, his time just a hundredth of a second short. Davenport, who was in Phelps' heat, is through though.</p> <!-- Block 119 --> <p><strong>12.38pm: Team GB badminton</strong> Tracey Hallam is thwacking a shuttlecock back and forth against Kristina Ludikova of the Czech Republic in the women's singles round of 32.</p> <!-- Block 120 --> <p><strong>12.42pm: Team GB swimming</strong> Kate Haywood and Kirsty Balfour are off in the women's 100m breaststroke...</p> <!-- Block 121 --> <p><strong>12.44pm:</strong> Haywood finished third, Balfour fourth, and they're both potential semi-finalists.</p> <!-- Block 122 --> <p><strong>12.47pm:</strong> They're both through, with the 11th and 14th best times respectively. The Australian Leisel Jones broke the Olympic record in that final heat, so she's the fish to catch. Haywood and Balfour will need to get to the final before I'm going to be lured into medal talk, though.</p> <!-- Block 123 --> <p><strong>12.55pm:</strong> In the Olympic football, we've got Netherlands versus the US, and Jacqui Oatley on the mic. Real Madrid's Roysten Drenthe hammers a left foot volley over the bar for the Dutch, as Aston Villa newbie Brad Guzan practises semaphore.</p> <p>Earlier, Ronaldinho scored twice in Brazil's 5-0 larruping of New Zealand. Argentina nicked it 1-0 against Australia, while Cameroon beat Honduras 1-0.</p> <!-- Block 124 --> <p><strong>1.02pm: Team GB swimming</strong> Liam Tancock, the British hope in the 100m backstroke comes home third in his heat after torpedoing off the platform. He'll be back in the semis later.</p> <!-- Block 125 --> <p><strong>1.06pm:</strong> Tancock goes out quick, that's what he does. He's pleased, as is Gregor Tait who's also in the semi-finals.</p> <p>And you'll be smiling when you've cast your mince pies over <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/gallery/2008/aug/10/olympics2008?picture=336400711\">these photos from today</a>.</p> <!-- Block 126 --> <p><strong>1.10pm: GOAL! USA 0-1 Holland</strong> Ryan Babel finishes from close range after some confusion in the box. Liverpool's wingman gets his first goal of the tournament.</p> <!-- Block 127 --> <p><strong>1.14pm: Team GB boxing</strong> Bradley Saunders has stopped his Ghanaian opponent Samuel Kotey Neequaye in the first round of their light welterweight match-up. Biff boff.</p> <!-- Block 128 --> <p><strong>1.18pm:</strong> Just getting a replay of that Saunders fight, and he really crunched the little fella with a body shot. Layed him flatter than a new patio.</p> <!-- Block 129 --> <p><strong>1.31pm:</strong> The geriatric form of Brian McBride is trundling around the more deserted parts of the pictch, ie. the Dutch half. How old is he? Answers in an email.</p> <p>Meanwhile, shattering news for all male Olympic-watchers: <strong> Anna Ivanovic has PULLED OUT</strong>. \"This is one of the worst moments of my career,\" she said. And I can only echo that statement.</p> <!-- Block 130 --> <p><strong>1.34pm:</strong> Half time score update:</p> <p>Serbia 1-2 Ivory Coast<br>USA 0-1 Netherlands<br>Belgium 1-0 China<br>Italy 2-0 South Korea</p> <!-- Block 131 --> <p><strong>1.38pm: Team GB swimming</strong> In the women's 400m freestyle, Jo Jackson has just finished second to Katie Hoff, the US bellwether in the pool, in a time that is just under a tenth of a second outside Hoff's <strong>new Olympic record.</strong></p> <p>Rebecca Adlington, who is being tipped as a British gold medal prospect, goes in the next heat.</p> <!-- Block 132 --> <p><strong>1.44pm:</strong> Adlington pushes the current world record holder Federica Pellegrini all the way in their heat, the Brit finishing second with the second-quickest time overall.</p> <p>Pellegrini also <strong>broke the Olympic record just set by Hoff</strong>, as it goes.</p> <!-- Block 133 --> <p><strong>1.50pm: Team GB badminton</strong> Gail Emms and Donna Kellogg are playing their Chinese opposition in the women's doubles. Earlier, Tracey Hallam progressed in her singles match, with a 21-18, 21-13 victory.</p> <!-- Block 134 --> <p><strong>1.53pm:</strong> The US men's 4x100m freestyle relay team has just set a new record over in the Water Cube. And Michael Phelps wasn't even near the pool. Apparently they're the US B-team. It's those Speedos, I tell you, should be banned...</p> <p>Great Britain are about to go in the second heat.</p> <!-- Block 135 --> <p><strong>1.58pm: Team GB swimming</strong> The British lads have gunned their way through that heat, finishing in fourth and sealing a spot in the final. They <strong>smashed the British record by five seconds</strong>, in the process.</p> <!-- Block 136 --> <p><strong>2.01pm: China have hoovered up another gold, this time in the men's 56kg weightlifting.</strong> Long Quinquan won from Anh Tuang Hoang of Vietnam and Indonesia's Eko Yuli Irawan.</p> <!-- Block 137 --> <p><strong>2.06pm: GOAL! USA 1-1 Netherlands</strong> Sacha Kljestan hammers a strike through the Dutch stopper after Freddy Adu's clever reverse pass. Yes, that Freddy Adu.</p> <!-- Block 138 --> <p><strong>2.12pm: Team GB hockey</strong> The girls from Blighty are taking on the Germans as I type, with the scores currently tied nil all. Someone has just been shown a green card - which means little to me, but is \"akin to a professional foul\" apparently. The best news though is that the legendary Barry Davies is providing the verbal annotation.</p> <!-- Block 139 --> <p><strong>2.17pm: GOAL! USA 2-1 Netherlands</strong> Jozy Altidore, newly-signed by Villarreal, has put the septics in front. Meanwhile, according to Sean Dickinson in Shanghai, someone in the China-Belgium game has been \"sent off for what appeared to be hitting someone [else] off the ball when the ref's head was turned\". If that's clear.</p> <!-- Block 140 --> <p><strong>2.25pm: Team GB hockey - GOAL! Germany 1-0 Great Britain</strong> \"Beautifully done,\" exclaims Barry Davies, as the GB ladies turn their opponents inside then out. Moments later Germany take the lead from a penalty corner.</p> <!-- Block 141 --> <p><strong>2.30pm: GOAL! Germany 1-1 Great Britain</strong> Back in the game. A penalty corner at the other end and the ball squirts into the goal off the wet surface.</p> <!-- Block 142 --> <p><strong>2.33pm: GOAL! Germany 2-1 Great Britain</strong> Ach, as soon as they're level there's a loss of concentration at the back by Britain and the red-clad Germans have the lead again.</p> <!-- Block 143 --> <p><strong>2.35pm: Olympic football - GOAL! USA 2-2 Netherlands</strong> The 34-year-old Gerald Sibon, who once played for Sheffield Wednesday, drills a free-kick under the wall and past Brad Guzan. That will certainly change the state of Group B - although I'm not entirely certain in what way.</p> <!-- Block 144 --> <p><strong>2.46pm:</strong> Final scores in the football for you:</p> <p>Serbia 2-4 Ivory Coast<br>USA 2-2 Netherlands<br>Belgium 2-0 China<br>Italy 3-0 South Korea</p> <p>It appears the hosts ended up with just nine men on the pitch in their loss to Belgium. Seems like the <a href=\"http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200407/16/eng20040716_149849.html\">inventors of football</a> are as adept at rolling over as we are.</p> <!-- Block 145 --> <p><strong>2.50pm: Team GB badminton</strong> After that flurry of GOALs I forgot to inform you that Emms and Kellogg were defeated in their first round doubles match against China's Zhang Jiewen and Wei Yili, losing 21-19 21-13.</p> <p>Still 2-1 to Germany in the hockey.</p> <!-- Block 146 --> <p><strong>2.55pm: Pat on the back dept.</strong> As this mbm prepares to roll up its bumper Olympic guide and head into the Beijing sunset, David Lloyd's email lands:</p> <p>\"I've been living in north China for around 18 months now, generally having a great time in an amazing country. So I've obviously been looking forward to these Olympics for a long time as you might imagine. To date however it's not been the best of starts. I was up at 5.30am to witness the torch relay but couldn't get within 30 metres of the road barrier, then the typhoon in South China kept me and my mate stranded just long enough to miss the football match in Tinajin last Wednesday night, for which I had tickets. Now to cap it all, I find that of the endless CCTV channels showing Olympic coverage, including the specially set up one, none have any spoken or written English language coverage. Considering all the effort the Chinese have put into these games, that's a big oversight if you ask me, especially when considering the tens of thousands of English speakers who've travelled here specially, not to mention the good ol' expat community.\"</p> <p>Glad to have been of service, David. We'll be here all fortnight.</p> <!-- Block 147 --> <p><strong>3.01pm: Team GB hockey - GOAL! Germany 3-1 Great Britain</strong> Looks like a wrap there then.</p> <p>With day two drawing to a close, I shall bid you all goodbye. If you fancy following the almighty ding-dong that's bound to ensue between China and the US in the basketball, slam-dunk you way across <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/10/china_v_usa_usa_usa_live.html\">to Lawrence Donegan's blog</a> now. And if diving and histrionics are more your thing, why not <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/aug/10/portsmouth.manchesterunited\">join Paul Doyle for the FA Community Shield</a>. That's it from me, cheerio.</p>"
