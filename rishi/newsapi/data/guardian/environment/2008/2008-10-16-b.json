  "<p>It has been a demanding transition, calling for a readiness to accept immersion in an entirely new way of thinking. The players have had it easy by comparison. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/fabio-capello\">Fabio Capello</a> is the person who has really put everything at risk. The \u00a36m a year was undoubtedly a consideration, but he could have sniffed out lucrative wages in club football if, in his sixties, he had decided to settle for the comfort of familiarity.</p> <p>Capello has been ready for the battle, prepared to grapple with a foreign language when others would have relished the excuse to depend entirely on an interpreter, who inevitably keeps interrogators at one remove. The image the Italian projects is of an autocrat whose mastery of every football issue is beyond dispute. No manager, of course, has actually been flawless.</p> <p>Nor is Capello viewed everywhere as above reproach. Wrong-headed as it looked in the wake of a La Liga title, Real Madrid sacked him because his style of play was incompatible with the club's idealised sense of itself. Without that, the FA would have had to find compensation as well as the funds to cover the grandiose salary. As it is, the departing chief executive, Brian Barwick, can be proud that, after the ill-starred pursuit of Luiz Felipe Scolari, he placed the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/england\">England</a> team in such strong hands.</p> <p>One of Capello's characteristics, it is now apparent, is a willingness to reconsider. There must be trial and error because he is not simply dealing with a new squad of Englishmen, but also encountering opponents who have a few wisps of mystery attached to them. There was nothing of that when he was going about his business in Serie A and had a complete appreciation of every person on the books of all rival clubs. In Spain, too, it cannot have been so hard to familiarise himself with the other teams in La Liga.</p> <p>Capello is to be applauded for the series of alterations he has made on the way to scooping all 12 points from the first four fixtures in Group Six and so making it feel that England are already on the verge of qualification for the 2010 World Cup. In some of these games he has been taken by surprise to a degree that would once have been unthinkable to him. No matter what videos and reports were scrutinised, Belarus remained a little alien.</p> <p>How well briefed can he truly have been, for instance, about the captain Alek-sandr Kulchy, who makes a living at the Russian club Rostov? The dossier cannot have predicted that he would have been so influential that England's team had to be reshaped at the interval. Steven Gerrard, detailed to stay in the centre and push up on the holding midfielder, then shut off the valve through which Belarus's play had been flowing.</p> <p>The rethink has been the key tool for Capello. Andorra were holding England until Stewart Downing was removed, with his replacement, Joe Cole, bagging two goals. There was no breakthrough against Kazakhstan either before Shaun Wright-Phillips came on as part of the switch to 4-4-2. Capello is to be congratulated in all of this. Not even this celebrated manager can be in the right on every occasion and problem-solving of this precision is rare.</p> <p>It is tough for Capello to be sure of the wisest policy. When people, for instance, complain about the occasional misuse of Wayne Rooney on the left they are prone to making the ludicrous assumption that neither the England manager nor Sir Alex Ferguson have noticed he is better in the vicinity of a centre-forward. They are profoundly conscious of that, but have other topics to address as well.</p> <p>When England accommodate Rooney as one of the strikers in a 4-4-2 they risk being outnumbered in midfield. If he is, instead, on the flank in a nominal 4-3-3 he and the player on the right can both shuttle back so England, if need be, get 10 men behind the ball. Various benefits have to be calculated. For the time being, Rooney, with five goals in three England matches, is doing so much harm to the opposition that it is essential to let him stay near to Emile Heskey.</p> <p>A different verdict will be reached on days when circumstances alter, as they are bound to. In the most important aspects Capello is not dogmatic at all. He changed his mind about Heskey, whose worth for his country had really been appreciated by Steve McClaren, even if he got few plaudits for the astuteness since his line-up could not reach Euro 2008.</p> <p>Capello has been doing wonderful work. Alluding to his background in club management, he spoke of the switch from operating with footballers he might have known for 10 years to training an England squad in 10-day bursts. In defiance of the restrictions, he seems to be engendering confidence and a hard-nosed commitment to victory. The Italian is warming, in addition, to people like Gerrard, who deplored his own England form ahead of the Belarus match. \"You need players with humility,\" he said. \"It is about respect for other players, for managers.\"</p> <p>All of England's improvement has come in the midst of experimentation. There should be even better times to come when Capello can open with a line-up that has absolutely no need of further tweaking.</p>",
  "<p>For a generation now, the received wisdom has been: \"Market good, state bad.\" But how do we square this equation with the collapse of the market economy and the idea that only the state can bail it out?</p> <p>For those of us concerned with the public sector, these issues are raised with particular intensity. Where does this leave the market-driven values we've been taught to internalise? What will it mean for public policy and the public service ethic? </p> <p>From Thatcher onwards, we have been told how hopeless public welfare is and how damaging state intervention has been. Welfare claimants have been held up as figures to despise and suspect. The state has been cast as wasteful, bureaucratic, inefficient and dependency-creating. Welfare claimants have been stereotyped as draining the wealth which the market has generated, their dependency presented as a burden on the rest of us through their cost in high taxation. </p> <p>Where once we heard that the welfare state would put an end to social evils, more recently we have been encouraged to believe that it's the cause of social breakdown, and \"benefit scroungers.\" The market and the private sector, we are told, alone have the competence, expertise and experience to provide efficient goods and services. They can convert us from clients and claimants patronised by the state to public consumers with choice and control. </p> <p>Yet now, without apparent embarrassment or hesitation, state intervention is advanced as all that stands between us and economic meltdown. </p> <p>The banks, we are told, so distrust each other that only unprecedented injections of state money may make it possible for them to do business together again. For years the Daily Mail and the Sun have run poisonous campaigns against asylum seekers and people on income support to reclaim an imagined few millions. Governments promote campaigns to snoop on welfare claimants. These campaigns rarely generate enough money even to pay for themselves. Yet now we are encouraged to spend hundreds of billions of public money to bail out the banks and private sector that preached the mantra of independence and individual responsibility.</p> <p>Are we really going to pretend that all this hasn't happened, carrying on as before as if the market hasn't now faced its equivalent of the fall of the Berlin Wall? Will we still be looking to bright young management consultants at \u00a31,000 plus a day, few of whom have even run a corner shop, to teach central government, local authorities and primary care trusts to be 'business-like'?</p> <p>What about the big voluntary organisations who tell us they must pay their chief executives the salary packages of the private sector if they are to get the brightest and the best? Many such charities have increasingly divested themselves of services as their metropolitan offices and fundraising departments have got larger and glitzier.</p> <p>What will go into the large organisational hole now filled with the \"visioning\", team-bonding babble lapped up from the commercial sector? This is the same private sector that has now for years been featherbedded by profit-taking from public utilities, government sell-offs, wasteful PFI schemes and government tax credit subsidies for low wages, operating within a globalised economy that exploits the majority world and its people and damages the environment.</p> <p>From Enron onwards, we have all known that the private sector bore no relation to the lean and efficient paragon we were told it was. No one's saying the private sector is all bad, just that it has been grossly oversold. Meanwhile the merits of public service values have been treated as, at best, worthy but dull. The current economic crisis should remind us of what we can gain from enduring values of collectivity and mutuality. Our energies must now be spent on updating them to match the challenges of the future.</p> <p>\u2022 Peter Beresford is professor of social policy at Brunel University</p>",
  "<p>The fish, of course, were first. The banks didn't come until much, much later, and with them the high-interest savings accounts and insanely leveraged investment vehicles, and the marauding young men with names such as Thor and Bj\u00f6rg\u00f3lfur whose debt-driven raids on bastions of the British high street made them, for a few brief years, the stars of the global credit party. </p> <p>But always, out there, were the fish. And as a shell-shocked Iceland now stares national bankruptcy full in the face, it's to the fish that it will have to return. And maybe to Bj\u00f6rk. But more of her later. </p> <p>There are no two ways about it, Reykjavik docks smell. Pay the taxi driver, in coins stamped with the image of an alarmingly large cod, open the car door and you're assailed by an overpowering stench of herring, haddock, halibut, saithe, whiting and something called deep sea redfish. </p> <p>Up the stairs, in an air-conditioned office with a picture window that looks out across clear water to the looming slopes of Mount Esja, </p> <p>Eggert Gudmundsson, boss of the country's biggest fishing business, HB Grandi, is in philosophical mood. </p> <p>\"All this, what has happened,\" he says, \"it has not been led by that big a group of people. We are hardworking, we Icelanders, but we are also a bit excitable. We are maybe more hunters than farmers. If we see a way to make quick money, we will jump. And a lot of people, that's true, jumped. Now we are all going to have to work very hard together to get ourselves out of this. We will have to go back to what we know.\"</p> <p>A few hundred yards away, just off Reykjavik's main shopping street, in a chaotic studio scattered with shining skulls, acrylic-coated ravens and T-shirts bearing the apposite message He Who Fears Death Cannot Enjoy Life, the artist J\u00f3n Saemundur Audarson is thinking out loud, too. </p> <p>\"There's shame, yes,\" he says, \"and humiliation. And anger at the country losing so much, all because a few boys were playing around with other people's money. But this whole thing, this long big spending spree, it was just a phase, you know? It hasn't changed Iceland. This could even be good for us. Take us back to what we really are.\"</p> <p>Palme Vidar, with the wisdom of 73 years, is equally ruminative. \"This is a small country,\" he says. \"We have always swung, between feast and famine. There have been terrible times before, too, when the sheep bubble burst and the herring fleet failed. We always hang on. And you know, we were not going in a good direction. When I was a boy, if you went to the harbour to fish and you got wet, you could not fish again until the next day, because you had only one pair of trousers. Today people have too many trousers.\"</p> <p>There's a lot of thinking going on in Iceland these days. </p> <p>In 1936, the poets WH Auden and Louis MacNeice came here for the summer. Iceland was, at that time, one of the poorest, most inward-looking and isolated countries in Europe. This bleak volcanic outcrop in the middle of the North Atlantic was, for them, \"holy ground\", ancient and mystical. Auden delighted in the dreamlike qualities of the landscape, but was dismayed by the insularity of the people, their life and culture. </p> <p>The food was dreadful, he complained, especially the putrefied shark's meat in sour milk. The outside world seemed not to touch a population numbering fewer than 120,000 (even today, Iceland has barely 300,000 inhabitants, not much more than, say, Doncaster). Reykjavik itself, Auden moaned, was \"the worst possible sort of provincial town as far as amusing oneself is concerned, and there was nothing to do but soak in the only hotel with a licence\".</p> <p>He wouldn't recognise it now, that's for sure. In the clean and, for the moment, still-prosperous streets of Reykjavik, Porsches jostle for parking space with enormous new 4x4s. Designer bars, all black leather, cream walls and ironically stuffed animals, rub shoulders with concept stores piled high - really - with Icelandic fashion. Restaurants offer \"modern Icelandic cuisine\", which turns out to be fish cooked in an exotic and over-complicated manner, but at least looks pretty cool. </p> <p>The transformation was absurdly swift. In 1943, Iceland was still a forgotten outpost of Denmark. In the 70s, it fought a series of nasty little fishing wars with Britain (and won, which might perhaps give Gordon Brown pause for thought when the lawsuits start flying - as they may well do - over his freezing of Icelandic banks' assets in the UK). It had no functioning stock market until 1990. Then, in the mid-1990s, it privatised its banks, slashed corporation tax, and a couple of Viking entrepreneurs made a shedload of money in Russia. From nowhere, Iceland suddenly topped the UN Human Development Index last year as the most developed country in the world, and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development declared it, per capita, the fifth richest nation on earth. Icelandic companies owned everything from Hamleys to West Ham United to Saks Fifth Avenue. Since then, obviously, it's all gone a bit pear-shaped. </p> <p>\"Things just get worse every day,\" sighs Erla Hlynsdottir, standing, understandably bemused, outside the clapboard former restaurant from where the prime minister has just addressed the nation. \"I have nothing, actually, so I've nothing to lose. But you wake up each morning and there's something else bad. First one bank's nationalised, then two, then all three. Then we ask Russia for help. Then your government says it's suing us. The stock market shuts. And now we're banging on the doors of the International Monetary Fund. How deep in this really are we?\"</p> <p>Pretty deep, is the answer. Iceland (or, to be fairer, a few dozen risk-happy Icelandic bankers and businessmen) has borrowed way, way too much, piling up debts worth maybe 10 times the country's entire GDP. Worse, it borrowed cheap and it borrowed abroad, which looked a good deal at the time but is now terrible, because in a global credit squeeze those debts cannot be refinanced. </p> <p>The national currency, as Professor Olafur Isleifsson of the University of Reykjavik puts it, has gone \"a very long way south\" and won't be coming back any time soon, so even if those debts could be rolled over, there aren't enough kronur in Iceland to make the repayments. </p> <p>Since the Reykjavik stock market has also sunk without trace (it reopened this week after a short closure, and instantly plunged 76%) and inflation is firmly in double-digit territory, the question is quite simply whether the government can possibly bail everyone out. At present, it seems not. An International Monetary Fund rescue package looks inescapable.</p> <p>Twenty years ago, a world financial crisis might barely have touched Iceland. Today though, it is, in the economists' phrase, globally engaged. And while by a cruel irony it never even touched the toxic sub-prime stuff that proved everyone else's downfall, it is still the meltdown in microcosm: driven, like the rest of us, to the brink of ruin by profit-hungry risk-takers who had closed their eyes to the dangers of what they were doing. Iceland is suffering more than the rest of us because, proportionately, it is so much more exposed. </p> <p>If a couple of banks go bust in America, observes the country's ever-courteous prime minister, Geir Haarde, \"it's dramatic, but not fatal\". If a couple of banks go bust in Iceland, on the other hand, \"that's this country's entire financial sector disappeared\". What Iceland has learned from this whole frightening experience, he wearily concludes, \"is that it is not wise for a small country to take a lead in international banking\".</p> <p>Iceland is certainly heading for hard times. The private jets (there were once so many that a local MP fought for flight restrictions at the airport); the Range Rovers bought with baskets of Japanese yen and Swiss francs; the magnums of Veuve Clicquot and Louis Roederer in the designer bars; the foreign holidays to Mexico and Grand Bahama are history. In the newpaper small ads, desperate men are now offering up to \u00a33,500 to anyone prepared to take their new car - and the foreign loan that paid for it - off their hands.</p> <p>But this will cut deeper than that. The discount Bonus supermarket has enough imported food left for about a fortnight, and the manager is not sure quite where the foreign currency will come from to buy more. According to the Icelandic trade federation, foreign suppliers are suddenly demanding payment up front. Shipments of food, medicines and oil are being given priority, but there is a real chance that Iceland will soon be running short of such \"non-essential\" goods as clothes. </p> <p>\"It's going to be very tough for a lot of ordinary people who understand nothing of all this,\" says Asbj\u00f6rn Jonsson, a third-generation fisherman. \"People are afraid. Ordinary, cautious Icelanders invested their savings in bank stocks, thinking they'd be more secure. Now we don't know what will happen tomorrow, let alone next month. Well, we know now that money is not made in banks. It's made by real people working hard at real jobs.\"</p> <p>Throughout these few rollercoaster months of credit crunch, stockmarket turmoil and, finally, wholesale inter-government rescue of the global financial system, economists, commentators and (mainly left-leaning) politicians have been suggesting that it would mark the end of the unbridled, deregulated capitalism unleashed in the Thatcher-Reagan years; the death of the masters of the universe and their unreal, incomprehensible \"fictitious economy\". Things will have to get real again.</p> <p>If that's so, then Iceland might, eventually, be all right. \"The fundamentals are good,\" is the mantra being endlessly repeated on the streets of Reykjavik, from prime minister to banker to economist to struggling small businessman to student. And it is, largely, true. At least, unlike some countries one could name, Iceland has a real economy. Finnur Oddsson, managing director of the chamber of commerce, describes it with a fluency born of much recent practice.</p> <p>Iceland, he says, has spectacular natural resources: the fish, of course, but also a surfeit of green energy (the island is a world leader in geo-thermal power, heating more than 90% of its homes this way and attracting big investment from energy-intensive industries such as aluminium). The average age is just 37, unemployment currently (though maybe not for much longer) stands at 1%, and women account for 46% of the workforce. </p> <p>\"It's going to be a long and rocky road getting out of this,\" predicts Oddsson. \"But longer term, Iceland is solid. For crying out loud, we're only exploiting about 30% of our energy potential right now - if we increase that, we can virtually write our own GDP.\"</p> <p>(Tourism looks like being an increasingly important little earner, too: what with the krona now being worth half was it was in April, interest in flights to Iceland from the UK alone is up 400% in a month.)</p> <p>Gudmundsson also has reason to be optimistic. \"I've just come from a meeting with the company's employees,\" he says. \"They were worried; I told them they needn't be. Look: what Iceland needs above all is a sustainable source of foreign currency, which means exports. Fish are half of Iceland's exports, and this company is 10% of Iceland's fishing business: we are responsible for one in every 20 euros Iceland earns. We're a company this country really cannot do without.\"</p> <p>There is a big issue, all concede, in the vulnerability of the krona. Iceland's future security is, unquestionably, in the euro, but that is unlikely to happen without some form of EU membership, now being seriously envisaged in Icelandic political circles for pretty much the first time. Unfortunately, the last thing the all-important fishing industry wants is to place its well-managed stocks in the hands of the catastrophe that is EU fisheries policy.</p> <p>\"But something's got to change,\" says Helga J\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir, a literature student and part-time waitress, striding along a wind-lashed pavement to work. \"This can't be allowed to happen again. We got in out of our depth, that seems plain. Maybe in this new kind of world where everything is connected we just need to be a part of something bigger. We need security.\"</p> <p>And Bj\u00f6rk, then? A short walk from the stench of the docks is Hotel 101, the hippest of Reykjavik's many boutique hotels, and its bar, quite the coolest in a town that, over the past 10 years, has acquired a somewhat unlikely reputation for cutting-edge culture. (The hotel, by the way, was designed by Ingibj\u00f6rg P\u00e1lmad\u00f3ttir, wife of Jon Asgeir J\u00f3hannesson, whose investment outfit Baugur bought half the British high street - and now may end up in big trouble unless it can flog its debts to the boss of Bhs, Sir Philip Green, or someone like him.)</p> <p>Sitting in the bar is young Charlie Strand, a half-British, half-Icelandic photographer and writer who has just published a book, Project: Iceland, chronicling the lives of some of the artists, musicians and designers in the vanguard of this unexpected flowering of far-Nordic talent. He's not altogether sure where it all comes from, he admits.</p> <p>\"Maybe it's because the arts are so new here, there's no tradition anyone has to follow. The landscape, nature, definitely has something to do with it: there's a kind of mental freedom here, a desire to do things your own way. There's no celebrity culture, none at all. That helps. And no one makes real money being an artist in Iceland, which says a lot about their real motivation. But it's true to say there's a very unusual level of creativity here. And there's beginning to be a big interest in it from abroad.\"</p> <p>If Bj\u00f6rk Gudmundsd\u00f3ttir is \"the grand queen of edge\", Strand lists a host of other musicians following in her wake: Sigur R\u00f3s, of course, but plenty of other critically acclaimed Icelandic acts are now capable of filling a venue with knowledgeable fans almost anywhere in the world: Mugison, the dance act GusGus, rockers Minus. \"There are bands here,\" sighs Strand, \"if they were in England, seriously, they'd be millionaires, in a fortnight.\"</p> <p>Visual artists such as Hrafnhildur Arnad\u00f3ttir, the Icelandic Love Corporation and Ragnar Kjartansson are exhibiting abroad to rave reviews; young Icelandic fashion designers are now working with big name collections in Paris, Antwerp and New York, and selling far beyond the country's borders. For a place a very long way from anywhere and with about as many inhabitants as Cardiff, it is, genuinely, an accomplishment.</p> <p>Can it help pull Iceland out of its present trough? Maybe not, quite yet, financially. J\u00f3n Saemundur's T-shirts are worn by the likes of Metallica, Placebo and Quentin Tarantino; his work, inspired by 14 years of living with HIV, is on display at the Icelandic National Gallery; he performed on stage this summer at Glastonbury. But he too has watched aghast in recent months as the amount he owes on his foreign-currency mortgage has doubled.</p> <p>In times like this, though, he says, creativity is important. \"Our culture can give us strength,\" he says. \"We are proud people, you know, and we've been through worse. When the volcano went up, a couple of hundred years ago, people were living in holes in the ground. There was never money here, not until well after the war. We can feed ourselves, you know. We have a lot of fish.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on Friday October 17 2008. In the article above we had Jon Saemundur Audarson as Anderson. This has been changed.</p>",
  "<p>The western <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/globaleconomy\">financial crisis is turning global</a> as capital-flows throughout the developing world have been transformed by the credit crunch into destructive riptides for scores of economies.</p> <p>Many boom nations of eastern Europe, Asia and Latin America are among those abruptly stalling, leaving governments wrongfooted by an investment exodus. Economists have been drawing up a critical list of vulnerable countries - identifying those struggling with giant current account deficits, undercapitalised banks, overheated stockmarkets and exposures to short-term overseas borrowing.</p> <p>\"The three Baltic states along with Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Bulgaria and Romania - and of course Iceland - are at the top of the list,\" said Nick Chamie, of RBC Capital Markets. He singled out Hungary, Romania, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia as least able to mimic the recent western bank bail-outs that have helped more mature economies reduce some of the most damaging effects of the crunch.</p> <p>Officials from the International Monetary Fund rushed to Kiev earlier this week. A succession of Ukrainian governments have failed to tame a foreign credit-fueled consumer boom and soaring inflation. An emergency IMF loan of up to $14bn (\u00a38.1bn) is being lined up as the local currency, the hryvnia, plummets. </p> <p>The move follows Iceland's crisis talks with both the IMF and Russian officials as it seeks rescue loans following the collapse of its banking industry, which had made loans equivalent to more than three times the country's GDP. The IMF has also been approached by Hungary and Serbia. </p> <p>Neil Shearing, an economist with Capital Economics, said Hungary, the Baltic and Balkan states, and Turkey all appeared to be slipping towards a similar balance-of-payments crisis. </p> <p>At an EU summit in Brussels yesterday Gordon Brown, President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, and others called for tomorrow's meeting of European leaders and George Bush at Camp David to be devoted to the redesigning of global capitalism. Sarkozy and the head of the European commission, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, are to lobby Bush to assent to a Bretton Woods II conference of at least 15 of the leading economies.</p> <p>\"The priority for us is the Saturday summit with the US president to prepare for the world summit which the world needs to recast the capitalist system, the financial and monetary system,\" said Sarkozy, who chaired the Brussels session.</p> <p>The spectre of contagion from the western financial crisis reached South Korea this week, when credit rating agencies warned that seven banks were heavily reliant on short-term foreign funding which, if recalled, could wreak havoc on the local financial system.</p> <p>Russia's rapid growth has spawned hundreds of banks, many of which have drawn funding from the international money markets. Several have been forced to seek government bail-outs.</p> <p>Brian Coulton, global head of economics at Fitch Ratings, said that shockwaves hitting the Russian banks were likely to be dealt with comfortably by the mountain of foreign reserves built up by the Kremlin. </p> <p>India, Brazil and China are not the brittle economies they once were and are expected to be among the least affected as the world economy slows.</p> <p>\"Taking emerging markets as a whole, the economic fundamentals are stronger than they were five years ago,\" said Coulton. \"But that is very much an aggregate picture. There will be some economies that fare much worse than others.\"</p> <p>Analysts at Standard &amp; Poor's agree that while the emerging markets boom has run out of steam, even a violent exodus of western credit is unlikely to trigger domino sovereign debt defaults as once it might have done.</p> <p>The burgeoning crisis has generated a rare mood of consensus in the EU behind swift and radical action. </p> <p>Brown said he wanted the world summit to take place before the end of the year. Sarkozy called for a November summit and has signalled his preference for New York as the venue. But the Japanese prime minister, Taro Aso, sounded sceptical yesterday, telling parliament in Tokyo that the situation was not yet bad enough to warrant such a step.</p> <p>Sarkozy admitted that there was no full agreement on how to proceed, but dismissed suggestions that a world summit should wait until a new US president was in the White House in January.</p> <p>\"We would otherwise have a meeting in the spring and that's much too late ... We must have a summit before the end of the year. Europe wants it. Europe will get it.\"</p> <h2>Shaky states</h2> <p>The creditworthiness of at least 10 countries around the world has more than halved in the last six months as the global credit crisis deepened, according to the credit data firm Markit. The cost of insuring against default sovereign debt issued by Ukraine with a face value of $10m, has jumped fivefold since April to $1.7m a year. This indicates the markets believe there is a strong chance the government - in emergency talks with the IMF since Wednesday - could go bust, with creditors recouping little of their loans to the country. The likelihood of heavy losses is even greater for those holding Icelandic sovereign debt. The cost of insuring $10m of Icelandic debt is $1m a year, more than three times what it was six months ago. Other countries with sharp deteriorations in their creditworthiness include Kazakhstan, Argentina, South Korea and Serbia. Meanwhile, despite the rash of bank bailouts in the UK, the cost of insuring $10m of government debt for this country remains relatively low, rising from $140,000 to $410,000 since April. This makes the cost of protecting UK sovereign debt against default almost exactly the same as the cost for buying similar protection on debt issued by McDonald's.</p>",
  "<p>The broken society has been replaced by the broke society in the headlines, but there are still plenty of policymakers, not least at Tory headquarters, drafting manifesto pledges for mending it. Today's report from the Millennium Cohort Study, the third in a series studying more than 15,000 children born in the first school year of the century, will provide them with a feast of statistics, not all of which substantiate the \"feral children\" and \"barbarian estates\" that crowd the imaginations of some on the right. For they show that the great majority of families, in every part of the United Kingdom, feel their children are growing up in a safe environment, attend the school of their choice and are happy with their lives. The catch is that the statistics were assembled in 2006, at the peak of the good times; without hard choices now, the next in this triennial series will not make such optimistic reading.</p> <p>Today's survey is a high-definition picture of Tony Blair's society. The overall impression is prosperous, but there is a mass of fine detail that confirms the central message of other surveys - that class remains the dominant influence on a child's chances. The wealthiest fifth have an income six times greater than those at the bottom. A third of children born since 2000 have experienced poverty. And the advantages and disadvantages that these figures imply are almost exactly mirrored in the life chances of the next generation. From the income, the educational achievements and the age of parents, it remains possible to deduce with depressing accuracy the outlook for their children. Although it is far from universally true, to be poor is to be more likely to be a young single parent, prone to illness - nearly half of all mothers under 30 had been diagnosed as depressed or anxious by the time their child was five - and under qualified for work. The right will interpret this as confirmation of their analysis of a broken society that might be patched up by, say, incentivising marriage. But young parenthood, it is clear from these statistics, is first of all a symptom of poverty and only later a cause. </p> <p>As recession starts to bite, tackling poverty must get the same attention as restoring financial stability. If hundreds of billions of taxpayers' money is there for the banks then there must also be cash there for people who rely on benefits and who risk further marginalisation as job opportunities disappear and welfare reform designed for more prosperous times comes into effect. This month's inflation figures, which dictate benefit uprating, fail to reflect the real rise in living costs for the poorest, the cost of food and fuel. Without action now, the next Millennium Cohort Survey will be bleak reading indeed.</p>",
  "<p>Looking for voters on a warm evening this week, Megan Tirpak and Jenn Gooding went door to door in a middle class neighbourhood of Morrisville, North Carolina. They found a cricket match - half a dozen children of South Asian descent who had set up a wicket in a driveway and were bowling a tennis ball.</p> <p>\"We're volunteers with the Obama campaign and we have early-voting information for you,\" Tirpak, a 25-year old college student, told a man standing nearby. The scene helps to illustrate why Barack Obama could be the first Democrat to carry the state since Jimmy Carter in 1976.</p> <p>In recent years North Carolina has seen an influx of educated workers to its burgeoning hi-tech and pharmaceutical sectors who are turned off by the Republicans' social conservatism. More than half the voters that Tirpak and Gooding encountered in Morrisville were immigrants. North Carolina is also one-fifth African American. </p> <p>Those factors, plus the efforts of thousands of volunteers like Tirpak and Gooding, have allowed Obama to pull level with, or even ahead of McCain in North Carolina polls. In a sign of Republican trepidation, McCain campaigned here on Monday.</p> <p>The cricketers are too young to vote, but the man watching them assured Tirpak and Gooding of his backing for Obama and gladly accepted the proffered campaign literature. \"Ah, I can vote at my son's school,\" he said. </p> <p>Tirpak has spent every evening this month going door to door to persuade a computer-generated list of likely Obama voters to get to the polls.</p> <p>\"The Obama campaign is everywhere,\" said Andrew Taylor, a political scientist at North Carolina State University. \"They have volunteers, they are calling everybody, including registered Republicans, and you don't hear anything on the McCain side.\"</p> <p>The discrepancy between Obama and McCain's field strength is plain: until last week Obama had 45 field offices across the state, compared with fewer than 20 for McCain. McCain has since opened more, but most only operate part time.</p> <p>Obama's massive volunteer corps in North Carolina and elsewhere seems to vindicate Democrats who in the spring said that the bitter and protracted primary battle with Hillary Clinton would ultimately benefit, not damage, the nominee.</p> <p>Ahead of North Carolina's May primary election, Obama staff and volunteers worked feverishly to register new voters and compile supporter lists. When Obama staffers returned in force over the summer, they reconnected with existing networks of volunteers who had spent the summer at fairs, baseball games and other events to register voters, gather names of likely supporters and spread the word about Obama. Figures from the state board of elections show the Democrats have made huge gains in the past year. Now 2.8 million Democrats are registered, compared with 2 million Republicans, with an additional 1.4 million independents.</p> <p>Unlike typical field operations, the Obama effort this year is notable for the level of autonomy afforded to groups of volunteers and for the close coordination between volunteer groups and paid field staff. Most political campaigns treat volunteers merely as labourers, assigning them rote tasks under staff management, while the Obama campaign divides entire neighbourhoods among different volunteer organisations. The volunteers also recruit more volunteers.</p> <p>Faulkner Fox, a writer and yoga instructor, helped to found the campaign group Durham for Obama in the winter. Now she and her husband, a Duke University professor, manage more than 100 volunteers who go door to door at weekends. Fox, a mother of three, spends 40 hours a week on campaign efforts, without pay. She has amassed detailed knowledge of the abilities of her workers and the environment on the ground, including \"which Wal-Marts would let us work in front of them, and which would not\".</p> <p>Before running for office Obama was a community organiser in Chicago and led a voter registration drive there. Fox attributes the intensity of the Obama campaign's field operation in part to that experience. She mocks the Republicans' apparent rejection of community organising as a political tool, evident in speeches at their September national convention.</p> <p>\"The Republican party was like, 'what is a community organiser?',\" Fox said. \"Well, on election day, you're going to find out.\"</p>",
  "<p>The American photographer William Claxton, who has died aged 80, was best known for his moody black-and-white portraits of jazz musicians and Hollywood stars. His skill, in addition to a powerful technical achievement, was to combine his own passions with his chosen medium, compiling a record of a particular cultural aspect of US life from the 1950s to the 90s based on his friendships and partnerships. </p> <p>His books on the musician Chet Baker and Steve McQueen contain seminal images, and a short film, an early \"fashion video\", Basic Black (1967), as well as The Rudi Gernreich Book (1991), produced with his wife, the model Peggy Moffitt, illustrated his somewhat unexpected venture into fashion.</p> <p>Claxton was born and raised in a comfortable home in Pasadena, California, and went to UCLA (the University of California, Los Angeles) to read psychology. He had by then taken up photography as a hobby, and his hefty 4in x 6in Speed Graphic camera accompanied him on visits to assorted jazz dives, where he began to shoot, even in the darkest of cellars. In 1952 he struck lucky at the legendary Haig club, where the Gerry Mulligan band was playing with Baker. There he met Dick Bock, founder of the Pacific Jazz label, who took Claxton on as art director and house photographer, providing him with the first opportunity to develop his work for a mass market. </p> <p>His psychology course was jettisoned. He concentrated instead on revolutionising his photographic style, which, he now recognised, he had inherited from the 1940s. \"Most of the jazz photography before me showed sweaty musicians with shiny faces in dark, smoky little bars. That was jazz to most people. But being on the west coast, I wanted to bring out the fact that musicians were living in a very health-conscious environment. So I purposely put them on the beach or in the mountains or on the road in their convertibles.\"</p> <p>He shared with McQueen a passion for fast cars, and this led to the celebrated image of the actor driving his Jaguar convertible along Mulholland Drive in LA, peering up over the rim of his sunglasses. Taken in 1962, the photograph was a departure from Claxton's earlier work, which might show, for instance, a young Frank Sinatra or Marlon Brando in Hollywood mode, slick in jacket, tie and felt hat. His graphic signature, however, was even then less in the setting than in its geometry: Sinatra leans at an angle into the frame, in precise mimicry of his built backdrop; Brando hunches soulfully before a hotel entrance whose glass panels outline his tipped stetson.</p> <p>These portraits take their place alongside a pensively youthful Dennis Hopper (1955), his face part-concealed by his hand in the field where he rests. A ground-level view is again taken of John Cassavetes (1962), sprawled with arms outstretched on the ground, his scowling demeanour competing for attention with shale on the beach in the foreground. Portraits of other film stars followed, from a kooky Shirley MacLaine, poking out her tongue, to Ursula Andress, throwing her head back in abandon. Male actors and directors look serious by comparison: Spike Lee intently studies a roll of film through outsized spectacles and Benicio del Toro (in a more recent portrait) is a black-and-white duet, his dark hair set against a shaft of sun creating pale highlights.</p> <p>Claxton broke into colour for fashion photography, which he began in the early 1960s. His wife was concerned about modelling a topless swimsuit for the designer Rudi Gernreich, and finally decided to go ahead, provided Claxton would photograph it. He took up the challenge: this was the period of op and pop art - although perhaps surprisingly this most striking portrait, the \"Rouault\" swimsuit, shows Moffitt in a geometrically arranged pose, sporting a laced network of red and black. In 1991, his fashion images were collected in The Rudi Gernreich Book, published by Benedikt Taschen, who described Claxton as \"... a great photographer who touched the lives of his friends through his generosity, charm and kindness\". </p> <p>Nowhere is this rapport with his subjects clearer, however, than in the images evoked by Claxton's first love. In his book Young Chet (1993), he wrote: \"Jazz is musical improvisation, it is the art of the moment. In the recording of jazz, the inspiration and inventiveness of this moment is made permanent by technology, giving pleasure many years after the performance.\" </p> <p>He added: \"Photography is jazz for the eyes. All I ask you to do is to listen with your eyes.\" The roll call reaches from Muddy Waters, strumming before a picket fence, tapping his white spats, through Billie Holiday in her heyday, illuminated against a blacked-out stage, and Lena Horne, slumped in an outsized dressing-gown, to Bob Dylan, Tom Jones, Joni Mitchell and Barbra Streisand. </p> <p>He also shot in the grotesque style, as in a painful portrait of Judy Garland in her dressing room, without make-up and swathed in a towel, arthritic hands grasping a wild-eyed face, as a bottle is handed over her bare shoulder; and a preposterous one of Isaac Hayes, commanding the entire frame in a fake fur robe and jangling bling, fat hands planted on spread knees. </p> <p>Claxton's immensely successful portfolio was reproduced in Time, Life, Vogue, Paris Match and Interview, and in more than a dozen large-format art books. He held dozens of exhibitions and his work, including Basic Black, is held in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York. He was a founding member of the Recording Academy, the organisation that initiated the Grammy awards, and is survived by his wife Peggy and son Christopher.</p> <p>\u2022 William James Claxton, photographer, born October 12 1927; died October 11 2008</p>",
  "<p>Our family had a real fire for longer than most - well into the early 70s. My dad would kneel reverently before it every morning, piling scrolled-up news-papers into a pyramid before putting on the coal. If it was particularly cold, I would lie on our sofa under a blanket, watching him. Sometimes I would scroll up a newspaper myself, and risk exposing my arm to the cold in order to pass it to him. When the fire got going, I thoroughly enjoyed it: I had earned that heat.</p> <p>The eventual installation of our own gas fire seemed like a bereavement. It seethed sinisterly. You lit it by poking in a match and waiting tensely, with averted face, for the boom. This was not progress as far as I was concerned, and in my adult life I have always try to live in a place with a fire. I will not rent a holiday cottage unless it has one, and real fires draw me repeatedly to places such as the White Horse and Griffin restaurant and hotel in Whitby, or the George hotel in Stamford. </p> <p>But now, suddenly, I am no longer alone in my pyromania. According to the Solid Fuel Association, sales of wood-burning and multi-fuel stoves are up 40% on last year.</p> <p>The motivating factor is the high price of electricity, oil and gas. Whereas gas bills have doubled in a year, new types of stoves are ever more attractive and efficient, and can be linked to central heating systems. The queasy economic and political times are also promoting a survivalist mindset. \"I know at least half a dozen people who've had gas fires disconnected and open fires put in because they're worried about the Russians cutting off our gas,\" says Martin Glynn, the Kent-based spokesman for the National Association of Chimney Sweeps. Jim Lambeth, general manager of the Solid Fuel Association, adds: \"Any solid fuel is seen as safe. You've got it stacked there in the back yard. It's like your piggy bank.\" </p> <p>I light my fire almost every evening between October and April, and if I had a stove I'd keep the glass door open, which would be less efficient but allow me to see the dancing of the flames. Some might think I've gone off the rails morally. Once, when I called my local council here in north London and asked, as a matter of purely academic interest, about the law relating to my firelighting activities, a spokeswoman replied in a disapproving tone, \"We are against any sort of burning, but there is no law relating to it.\" As regards the law she was completely wrong, as we shall see. But what interested me was the priggish tone. </p> <p>The original reason for disapproving of open, or real, fires was smoke. Domestic fuel burning was partly responsible for the smogs of the 1950s. These gave us Margery Allingham's terrific crime novel, The Tiger In The Smoke: \"The sky was yellow as a duster and the rest was granular black, overprinted in grey and lightened by occasional slivers of bright fish colour as a policeman turned in his wet cape.\" But they also killed hundreds of people. They prompted the clean air legislation, which was later consolidated in the Clean Air Act 1993.</p> <p>This designated most towns and all cities as Smoke Control Areas, within which only smokeless solid fuel may be burned, except in the case of appliances approved for burning non-smokeless solid fuel. Ordinary, untreated coal is not smokeless, except in the case of anthracite, which burns too slowly for household use unless you're a particularly skilled firelighter, which I like to think I am. Since it is now fashionable for politicians to admit to drug use, I don't mind declaring that I have in the past experimented with anthracite and untreated wood (which is also not smokeless) while living in a smokeless zone. I've given up now - I'm a reformed character - but it's easy to see how I was tempted down that path. Logs are openly sold at all my local petrol stations, albeit at twice the price they'd be in the countryside. And whereas chimney inspectors apparently patrol German cities, they are not often seen on our own streets. I now confine my own wood burning to the use of twigs to get the smokeless briquettes going, and this is allowed under the smoke-control legislation. </p> <p>Another objection to real fires, whether burning smokeless fuel or not, is that they are environmentally unsound. The issue is quite complicated - or at least it always has been to me - and I once found myself in a moral tangle when starting a fire with a taper made from a Green party leaflet. An open fire is generally an inefficient way of heating a room. Most of the heat goes up the chimney, so more emissions are generated than strictly necessary. But wood as a fuel is considered carbon neutral in that one is only releasing the CO2 captured by the growth of the tree - and trees are renewable. I also wonder whether the labour involved in making a fire might be beneficial here. Our own gas central heating is currently bust and, what with times being hard, we aren't inclined to get it fixed. Whereas I always used to turn on the central heating when I felt cold, I don't just make a fire at the drop of a hat. I put on a jumper instead. And I am more willing to endure a cold day because it increases the satisfaction of lighting a fire in the evening. A fire gives you a reason to be cold.</p> <p>But the final objection to fires is that the firelighter commits the sin of being cosy. When I send out my Christmas cards, which typically feature Mr Pickwick warming his considerable bottom before a roaring blaze, while proclaiming in a speech bubble, \"This ... This is indeed comfort\", I foresee the recipients sneering, especially those that think of themselves as modern. These are the types who might have a flat-screen TV on their chimney breast, which obviously dictates no fire below. Or they might have some display of revolving lights, or a \"flame effect\" fire. Anyone of such pallid tastes would no time for Charles Dickens, whose insecure childhood - according to his biographer Peter Ackroyd - gave him \"an acute sense of, and need for, 'home', and in speaking after the comforts of the hearthside, he reflected the spirit of the times\".</p> <p>It was perhaps an attempt to reconnect with naturalness in the machine age that made the Victorians such lovers of the hearth. They always preferred open fires to the iron stoves that took off in the rest of northern Europe. They liked the look of them, and the mood they created. </p> <p>Open fires need more work than stoves, but I enjoy the work, the sense of practising a traditional craft. When I go out collecting sticks with my sons, I say, \"If it won't snap, I don't want it\", just as my father did to me. I know that you can't cut corners; that you need at least 30 rolled-up sheets of newspaper in the grate before you even think about making your pyramid of kindling. But then again, you might be able to revive a sluggish fire by stretching a sheet of newspaper across the top of the fireplace so as to improve the draw of the blaze. And I know that a room in which a fire burns must be ventilated to reduce the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning, especially if one is burning logs, which I never do, as I keep saying. </p> <p>The hearth is the focus of my house, and the television comes a poor second. A fire is more visually interesting than 90% of TV programmes, and has better dialogue, in fact, than most. </p> <p>I keep my invitations (I currently have none) on the mantelpiece and if my wife would let me, I'd keep my unanswered letters skewered there by a dagger, as Sherlock Holmes does. </p> <p>We're in for a cold winter, apparently. Personally I am looking forward to it.</p> <p><strong>What about the environment?</strong><br>Buy a stove - and burn wood</p> <p>Open fires might look great but they will leave any eco aspirations you might harbour up in smoke. Up to 90% of the heat generated will be lost up the chimney. Worse, perhaps, open fires can create considerable draughts, sucking cold air inside the home through any openings they can find. It is far, far more efficient to install a stove, where the heat, exhaust and airflow can all be controlled.</p> <p>The first thing to consider is whether you live in a smoke-control area. If so, you can only use an \"exempted\" stove to burn wood or smokeless solid fuels such as anthracite. (Visit <a href=\"http://www.uksmokecontrolareas.co.uk\">uksmokecontrolareas.co.uk</a> for more info.) Next you need to have your chimney checked out. Chances are it will need to be lined first. Buying a good stove (look for a \"clean burn\" stove) and getting your chimney in order will probably set you back about \u00a31,000. And remember that planning laws mean it must all be done by a HETAS qualified fitter (<a href=\"http://www.hetas.co.uk\">hetas.co.uk</a>).</p> <p>Solid fuels such as anthracite are fossil fuels, so it's best to use wood - broadleaf is better than conifer. But it must be well-seasoned - a process that can take a year or more - and cut to the right size, otherwise it will burn inefficiently and add to your costs by tarring up your stove and chimney.</p> <p>Look for a local supplier that sources timber from sustainable sources (ie a replacement tree is planted when one is cut down). Tree surgeons often sell off their waste wood, but nets of logs on sale in most garages are usually very expensive and poorly seasoned. A well-seasoned log will feel light because it lacks moisture.</p> <p>Finally, when using your stove, keep the door shut and use the air vents - wood should be vented from below, whereas solid fuels are vented from above. And have your chimneys swept twice a year.

  "<p>They said it would never happen. Oil was not supposed to fall below $70 a barrel, which is reckoned to be the minimum level at which producers in Canada's tar sands and in deep-water facilities off the west coast of Africa - the most expensive places in the world to pump oil - can make a profit. These are the so-called marginal cost producers and their economic models were meant to establish a floor on prices. </p> <p>What is going on? The most straightforward factor is an old-fashioned shift in the balance between supply and demand as recession approaches; the latest inventory data from the US confirms stockpiles are rising. Colder economic breezes are also reaching Asia, where China has been the major source of new demand for oil in recent years.</p> <p>Then there is renewed strength in the dollar, the currency in which oil is traded. Research house Capital Economics calculated that a quarter of the surge in the price of oil from $20 a barrel in 2002 to the peak of $147 in July this year could be explained by dollar weakness; that currency factor is now unwinding.</p> <p>There is also the other financial unwind - the liquidation of portfolios by speculators. This effect is impossible to measure precisely, but the hedge fund industry is in turmoil. Are hedge funds still holding big, long positions in oil? Actually, they are probably short by now. Either way it is clear the financial authorities are making it harder to speculate in either direction by cranking up margin requirements - in other words, the up-front deposit required to trade. </p> <p>When that has happened in the past, price volatility has usually followed.</p> <p>In the short term, we can probably expect more of the same. The marginal cost of production is a theoretical figure. When demand evaporates, higher-cost producers should be forced out of business and production should shift to cheaper locations. That assumes, of course, lower-cost producers are willing and able to increase production. Opec is unwilling: the cartel yesterday brought forward its next meeting, suggesting it will cut output soon. The tactic is not guaranteed to work, however - it rarely did in the 1990s, when cheating on production quotas was the norm. Julian Jessop, chief international economist at Capital Economics, says the downward pressure on price would still prevail. </p> <p>\"Even allowing for Opec output cuts in response to weakening demand, oil prices could plausibly drop to $50 again in the next year or so,\" he argues.</p> <p>If he's right, the politics of oil become interesting. Iran, it is sometimes said, needs an $80 price in order to fund its social welfare programme; the Saudi Arabian budget, according to the same back-of-the-envelope calculations, balances at $55. Are those reasons to worry about political instability? Maybe not. Perhaps Russia might be less beligerent in its foreign policy, and more encouraging to investment from overseas.</p> <p><strong>Blunt argument</strong></p> <p>In fact, the people most worried about the market are the western oil companies, which must make investment decisions based on the oil price. Just now they can see their shipping costs falling, but very few other overheads are declining in price. Their argument is that the west, let alone the Middle East, needs an $80 oil price to provide an economic incentive for oil exploration or investment in cleaner sources of energy. In the long term, that blunt economic argument is surely correct, implying energy prices will trend higher eventually. The energy crisis probably won't go away that easily.</p> <p>In the short term, though, anything seems possible. A deep global recession and disarray among Opec members could be the dominant themes in the next couple of years. Does the bottom for oil lie at $60, $50 or even $40? We know commodity prices always overshoot economic fundamentals. Boom and bust has always been the story.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:nils.pratley@theguardian.com\">nils.pratley@theguardian.com</a></p>",

  "<p>Of all the adjectives that could be applied to AC/DC, \"unique\" is perhaps the least likely. There must be hundreds of bands exactly like them in bars and pubs around the world, ruining locals' attempts to have a quiet pint, performing songs called things like Spoilin' for a Fight, attempting to leaven their hackneyed blues-rock with a few risqu\u00e9 gags about tits and bums. And yet, in one sense, AC/DC are unique. It's impossible to think of another band that's been praised so much and rewarded so lavishly for doing so little, at least artistically.</p> <p>Their sound is like Noel Edmonds' hairstyle: it was hoisted into place at some point in 1974 and has remained almost entirely unaltered ever since. Those who queue up to buy Black Ice, like those who queued up to buy its 15 predecessors, do so knowing precisely what they're going to get. There will be staccato guitar riffs, Angus Young's admirably unflashy and economical soloing and songs with rock'n'roll in the title. And there will be smutty puns. No one over the age of 12 or outside the offices of Viz has ever made so much capital from the words \"big\", \"hard\" \"stiff\", \"up\" and \"balls\".</p> <p>You could perhaps compare AC/DC's dogged single-mindedness to that of the Ramones, but even they felt the need to briefly adopt the warp-speed stylings of hardcore punk in the mid-80s, which by AC/DC's standards marks them out as worrying dilettantes. And the Ramones split up after 22 years. Nothing - not line-up changes, changing tastes nor even death - can flatline AC/DC's career. If the global warming doomsayers' worst predictions are realised and the world is entirely subsumed beneath a flood, there seems the distinct possibility you will find AC/DC bobbing about atop the deluge, still gamely performing a hard-edged blues-rock number, probably called something like Balls Deep.</p> <p>A cynic might say that the kind of person who can distinguish a good </p> <p>AC/DC album from a bad one is like those faintly disturbing wine buffs who can tell you the terroir in which grapes were grown just by holding a glass to the light: it's a specialist skill garnered through a lifetime of intensive research, a considered judgment based on infinitesimal differences, entirely beyond the ken of ordinary mortals. The cynic has a point, although it's pretty obvious even to a layman that much of the band's thrilling early malevolence departed with their late lead vocalist Bon Scott - a man rejected by the Australian army on the grounds of being \"socially maladjusted\" - and that their sound reached a peak of perfection on Highway to Hell and Back in Black, the albums made immediately before and after Scott's death. </p> <p>There are moments when Black Ice boasts the same irresistible appeal to the lower self with which those albums are packed, when AC/DC's sound seems fundamental and undeniable: the crunching chords with which the chorus of Rock 'N Roll Dream introduces itself, the gripping slide guitar riff of Stormy May Day, the way Young's guitar weaves and stabs around Brian Johnson's vocal during War Machine's verses, She Likes Rock 'N Roll's gleefully idiotic chant of a chorus. Equally, there are moments where the most remarkable thing about AC/DC seems to be the prodigious feat of memory that enables the members to recall which song they're playing. </p> <p>But Black Ice clearly isn't a record particularly interested in what the layman thinks: if you've sold 200m albums worldwide, you don't really need to go around touting for new clients. It's a record aimed at the band's existing audience, and far more important than any qualitative highs and lows is the fact that everything you might expect is present and correct. Black Ice delivers not just songs called Rock 'N' Roll Dream and She Likes Rock 'N Roll, but one called Rock 'N Roll Train as well: a veritable bumper harvest. If there isn't actually a song with \"balls\" in the title, there is at least Big Jack, the titular hero of which can boast among his many attributes \"a full sack\". It's business as usual, and it's a brave or foolhardy soul who would bet against business being extremely brisk.</p>",
  "<p>The Football Association will enforce the legal requirement for bookmakers to assist in its match-fixing inquiries after launching a probe into allegations of a betting sting at Derby County's recent 2-1 win over Norwich City in the Championship.</p> <p>Bookmakers noted unusual betting patterns during the match at Carrow Road on October 4. Punters in the far east are believed to have placed a flood of money during half-time, although industry observers report that the betting patterns indicated that the punters thought Norwich would win.</p> <p>Bookmakers who are known to have offered their assistance to investigators and the two clubs involved say they have not yet been contacted by the FA but its chairman, David Triesman, said last night that the inquiry would be \"thorough\". </p> <p>\"It will be days before people begin to go through all the information that is needed to get a sense of what may or may not have happened so it is too early to talk about a timescale,\" said Lord Triesman. \"My insistence is that it's thorough.\"</p> <p>The Gambling Act makes provision for all sports governing bodies to demand the assistance of British-based bookmakers when investigating threats to their competitions' integrity. The FA will call on that legislation to widen its inquiries. But the investigation will be a stiff test of the FA's anti-corruption processes because the markets were made by betting operators in the far east. It is unclear whether Soho Square's links with the global gambling industry are as robust as those in the UK.</p> <p>Derby's manager, Paul Jewell, insists his club have no case to answer. \"We've not heard from the FA and we don't expect to either,\" he said. \"If it needs investigating they'll investigate it but there's certainly nothing for us to hide. </p> <p>\"It's comical. I'd like to say I've been paid out so it doesn't really matter but it's something that as far as I'm aware is nonsense. It's just such a big surprise that Derby went down to 10 men and won a game.\"</p> <p>Jewell made light of a situation he considered \"laughable if [the allegation] wasn't so serious\", self-deprecatingly alluding to his club's 51-week winless sequence. Since the win over Sheffield United in mid-September that ended that dismal run, his team have strung together five games without defeat. The win over Norwich a fortnight ago made it 12 points from a possible 18.</p> <p>During that match Roy Carroll, Derby's goalkeeper, was sent off five minutes after half-time and Sammy Clingan converted the resulting penalty to equalise. But Derby secured the win five minutes from time, after a defensive mix-up involving Norwich's goalkeeper and centre-half allowed Nathan Ellington to score from close range.</p> <p>The Norwich North MP, Ian Gibson, who attended the Championship match, initially drew attention to the FA's investigations by tabling a parliamentary question to the culture secretary demanding swift action in the inquiry. </p> <p>However, even Gibson reflected that the circumstances of the game were not immediately considered anything other than the normal course of a football match. \"No one who was there thought it suspicious,\" he said.</p> <p>The Norwich chief executive, Neil Doncaster, said his club had yet to be contacted by the FA but he was not pleased with how the matter was raised. \"It is certainly slightly disappointing that the MPs concerned have talked to the media before picking up the phone and talking to us.\"</p> <p>Jewell was also not amused by the intervention of a parliamentarian. \"MPs are having a tough time at the minute because the country's struggling,\" he said. \"Maybe they're trying to deflect the blame.\"</p>",
  "<p>Tartan, says Jonathan Faiers in his new book about the fabric, is the immediately recognisable symbol of a fiercely independent nation. He's right, of course. But is it something we Scots can really embrace as a fashion item? Every couple of years or so, the fabric of our national dress sashays down the catwalk, like that crazy old aunt we love but don't know how to cope with when she comes to stay. What is a fashion-conscious Scot to do?</p> <p>I knew tartan was coming, and I thought I was prepared. I had seen the ad campaign by D&amp;G, the reappearance of plaid on Alexander McQueen's runway, and the bold prints at the House of Holland show. But I didn't quite realise how huge the trend would be this season. It's literally everywhere. You can't move on the high street for the belts, dresses, shoes, bags and even beads (thanks, Topshop) covered in cheap tartan print.</p> <p>A trip round Primark at the moment stirs horrific memories of country dancing at school ceilidhs, and awkward teenage snogs on the dancefloor, bedecked in Royal Stewart - the bright red tartan that Queen Victoria declared the clan tartan of the United Kingdom, and favoured by shortbread-tin, tea-towel and trinket-box manufacturers the world over.</p> <p>And so our dilemma begins. Do we proudly buy into the trend, or do we ignore it, fearful that we look contrived and cliched in the fabric? Such fears are not unfounded. </p> <p>I decided, in a show of national pride and as a fashion experiment, to embrace the trend, and thought I looked the bee's knees with my tartan puff-sleeved blouse, high-waisted flared jeans and wedge heels. \"Long live the Bay City Rollers,\" shouted a passerby as I worked my look on Glasgow's Buchanan Street. </p> <p>Is tartan to be worn only in certain circumstances: to that ceilidh, to the football, as part of the Tartan Army; or as fancy dress in a \"look at us in our ridiculous tartan outfits - we've come as Fran and Anna\" kind of way. (Singing sisters Fran and Anna were the epitome of tartan kitsch. Google them - it's worth it.)</p> <p>As much as Emma Plazalska, from Scotland-based designer boutique chain Cruise, loves House of Holland's bold blue tartan for this season, it's not for her. \"I just can't bring myself to wear it. I adore Kelly Osbourne in the jacket, and Mary Kate Olsen works tartan well, in a clumsy, thrown-together way, but it's just not for me.\" It's not, it seems, for her employer either. \"We haven't bought into the trend heavily at Cruise. Aside from a few select Westwood pieces, we just haven't gone down this route - our customer base hasn't demanded it from us.\"</p> <p>At this year's Scottish Fashion Awards, Henry Holland won the best use of tartan by an international designer award. Event founder Tessa Hartmann introduced the category for the first time, in the third year of the awards, because \"global brands have been hurling themselves into a highland fling with the use of our precious fabric in the past 12 months, and it's wonderful for us as a nation.\"</p> <p>She believes the explosion of tartan on the high street this season can only benefit Scotland. \"The Scottish government and VisitScotland should send out a global message of thanks to the fashion world, for fashion editors and consumers have rekindled their love affair with tartan and that can only benefit the industries involved.\"</p> <p>James Sugden, the group managing director of Johnstons of Elgin, won't argue with that. \"Tartan is never far from the catwalk, but this season we are definitely seeing an increase in sales. We probably haven't been as busy on tartan for some five years.\"</p> <p>There is, of course, a huge difference between the sumptuous fabrics woven by companies such as Johnstons and used by the likes of Westwood and McQueen, and the cheap copies in high-street stores. For Mary McGowne, director of the Scottish Style Awards, tartan invokes cliched memories, of \"the Bay City Rollers and the World Cup in 1978\". However, she is not against wearing tartan, provided it is a quality item. \"I have a pair of wide-legged plaid trousers from one of Alexander McQueen's very first collections, and they have stood the test of time. </p> <p>I wouldn't be averse to wearing a piece of vintage tartan. An elaborate cape would be perfect for a romantic Highland retreat. However, I believe tartan only really works to stunning effect when interpreted by someone like Westwood, who has the amazing ability to merge painstaking craft and plush heritage fabrics from textile houses like Lochcarron, with her theatrical signature silhouettes.\"</p> <p>Howie Nicholsby, creator and designer of 21st Century Kilts, who has \"kilted out\" the likes of Vin Diesel and Madonna, is a huge fan of his national fabric. \"We must support any surge in tartan as a fashion trend. Designers such as D&amp;G, Westwood and Commes Des Gar\u00e7ons all use cloth woven in the Borders. My bugbear is not tartan as a trend, but the mislabelling of the kilt - when something that is clearly not a kilt is called such. That cheapens our national dress for me. And some people just don't suit tartan. It's not a forgiving pattern, you know.\" </p> <p>Westwood's use of tartan, so triumphant in her iconic 1993 Anglomania collection, is second to none. Forget clans, the rights and wrongs of wearing tartan, and any of the stuffy tradition that can go with it. Westwood has torn up the rule book year after year and constantly mixes different tartans, all made to order at Lochcarron. Westwood loves the fabric so much she has a tartan carpet in her design studio in Battersea.</p> <p>\"Tartan looks wonderful with everything,\" she says. \"Even other tartans. The idea that this tartan belongs to this house or another was developed by the Victorian tourist industry.\"</p> <p>It is true that we Scots can get a bit precious at times about our tartans. Can a Campbell really wear a McGregor? And how dare these English wear a kilt? But, as Faiers explores in his book, many like to wear our fabric as a display of genuine affection for our nation. The French have a penchant for tartan that goes way back to the auld alliance. My Gallic sister-in-law wore tartan skirts to school (and graduated to a Scottish husband) as did, and still do, many Scottish schoolgirls. But sometimes the wrong use of tartan comes back to prove that perhaps our wariness was right.</p> <p>The mini-kilt has developed an identity all of its own, and not a very savoury one. Unfortunately, as Faiers explains, the mini-kilt has become a sexual item - a favourite of the Japanese \"kogal\" girls who \"sexualise their school uniforms\". Think Go-Go Yubari, the kilted schoolgirl assassin in Kill Bill, and you get the idea.</p> <p>But bad taste aside, maybe Lorraine Pringle, marketing director of Warehouse and a proud Scot, sums it all up perfectly. \"When I see tartan in fashion it just makes me smile and think of home.\"</p>",
  "<p>Well, it was nice while it lasted. The action by the world's central banks to prevent a death spiral in global financial markets prompted a relief rally, but it lasted just 48 hours. Now it's back to business as usual, with shares tumbling, awful economic news and banks whingeing about their bail-out terms.</p> <p>In all likelihood, state intervention means there will not be an implosion of the financial system leading to a 1930s-style depression. Central banks have made it clear that they will do whatever it takes to keep markets functioning and, although not everybody has woken up to the fact yet, they mean it. But just because the worst case has been avoided does not mean that we are heading rapidly back to the world as it was 15 months ago. Far from it. Nothing that has happened this week will prevent a severe global recession, with the UK - heavily dependent on housing and finance - one of the main casualties.</p> <p>Even so, there were reasons to be cheerful yesterday. One is that the Bank of England has got the message and is likely to cut interest rates aggressively over the coming months. Too late to prevent a significant rise in unemployment, of course, but welcome nonetheless.</p> <p>A second is that the Treasury is adopting a relatively robust line with the banks over dividends. The time for the banks to bargain over dividend policy was last weekend, during negotiations on the structure of the bail-out. It is absurd for the banks to say now that they want the money from the state but don't like the terms. In any event, for banks that are short of capital, dividends to share-holders are a luxury they cannot afford. The priority is to build up their capital base and if they can do that without recourse to the taxpayer, then of course they should be free to pay dividends. If they can't, the public mood is so hostile towards the banks that the government may lose patience and decide that total nationalisation of the most troubled institutions is the only logical outcome. Which it could well prove to be, given the state of the markets.</p> <p>The final piece of good news was the announcement yesterday by Ed Miliband, the new secretary of state for energy and climate change, that he will introduce a feed-in tariff so that those who invest in small-scale electricity generation can sell excess power back to the grid. This sends out an important signal that ministers are serious about tackling climate change and are not, like Italy or Poland, using the financial crisis to wriggle out of their commitments.</p> <p>Comparisons with the 1930s cut both ways. While the outlook for growth and unemployment is far less bleak than it was in the Great Depression, there are now two other threats: climate change and peak oil. All in all, the world is in a far more precarious position than it was when Roosevelt arrived in the White House in 1933 with his New Deal, and there is a need for the same urgency that marked last week's wholly necessary recapitalisation. It can be done if, as last weekend showed, there is the will.</p> <p>Earlier in the summer the New Economics Foundation put out a pamphlet calling for a Green New Deal. This called not just for tougher controls of the global financial system but for large-scale investment in renewable energy and wider environmental transformation that would create a new army of green-collar workers. The UN has latched on to the idea and will call next week for redirection of investment away from speculation and into programmes that foster natural environment. Gordon Brown is calling for a Bretton Woods II to reshape the global institutions in a post-bubble world; a Green New Deal should be the starting point for discussions.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:larry.elliott@theguardian.com\">larry.elliott@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The days of soft-touch regulation of the City are over, <a href=\"http://www.guprod.gnl/business/regulators\">the head of the financial watchdog</a> said yesterday, as he revealed that a new cadre of higher-paid regulators would ask tougher questions about the health of financial institutions <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/marketturmoil\">in the wake of the credit crisis</a>.</p> <p>In an interview with the Guardian, Lord Adair Turner admitted that the Financial Services Authority had tried to regulate <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/banking\">Britain's big banks</a> \"on the cheap\" in the past, but said a more stringent regime was on the way. \"There will be more people asking more questions, and getting more information, than we were getting before,\" Turner said. \"There is no doubt the touch will be heavier. We have to make sure it is intelligent and focused on where the risks really are.\"</p> <p>With shares remaining volatile in markets across the globe, London's FTSE 100 closing at its lowest in more than five years, and controversy about the terms of the Treasury's bank bail-out plan, the chairman of the FSA said it would take time for the plan agreed with the banks at the weekend to have an impact.</p> <p>The world economy was on course for a recession, he added, but it would avoid a slump. \"There's no chance of a 1929-33 depression. We know the lessons, and we know how to stop it happening again.\"</p> <p>Turner said the FSA was recruiting staff in order to stiffen up regulation of banks and other institutions considered too big to fail. \"We'll have more people looking at the high-impact, systemically important firms with major knock-on effects than we did before,\" he said. \"We will pay more than necessary to attract the correct quality of people from outside. Poachers turned gamekeepers are very attractive to hire. The FSA, in relation to systemically important firms, was [until now] trying to do regulation on the cheap.\"</p> <p>One result of the crisis of the past 15 months, Turner said, was to free the FSA from the charge that it was stifling the City with bureaucratic controls. \"If a year and a half ago, the FSA had wanted higher capital adequacy, more information on liquidity - had said it was worried about the business models at Bradford &amp; Bingley and Northern Rock - and had wanted to ask questions about remuneration, the fact is that we would have been strongly criticised for harming the competitiveness of the City of London, for red tape, and for over-regulation,\" he said.</p> <p>\"It [the crisis] frees one from the danger that one is going to be criticised in that over-sloganised way, which has been used for the past 15 years to cover up the defects in that argument. We are now in a different environment. We shouldn't regulate for its own sake, but over-regulation and red tape has been used as a polemical bludgeon. We have probably been over-deferential to that rhetoric.\"</p> <p>In a fresh day of turbulence on global markets, an 11% fall in Tokyo's Nikkei index triggered a sell-off on European bourses. The FTSE 100 in the City followed Wednesday's 7% drop by falling a further 5.4% to close 218.2 lower at 3,861.4. Markets in Paris and Frankfurt fell in tandem with London.</p> <p>But there was brighter news from Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average ended up 4.7%, buoyed by falling oil prices and bargain hunting among traders.</p> <p>Gordon Brown demanded the oil companies fully pass on lower energy costs to motorists, after the cost of crude slipped to $66 a barrel yesterday - less than half the peak of $147 a barrel reached in early July.</p> <p>Some supermarkets have cut pump prices to just under \u00a31 a litre, but this is still 7p higher than when oil prices were last at their present level in the spring of 2007.</p> <p>The AA said last night that forecourt prices were falling more rapidly than they had risen when crude was surging in the summer, but the prime minister said that they had further to fall.</p> <p>\"The public know that when oil prices go up, it's reflected very quickly in the pump price. What they want to know is, when oil prices come down, that is also reflected in the pump price,\" Brown said at the EU summit Brussels, where he called for a global summit for the G8 and leading developing countries in America next month to tackle the financial crisis.</p> <p>\"I want to see the competition between supermarkets and oil companies reflected in lower prices at the pumps,\" he said.</p> <p>The stand-off between the City and the government over dividends to banks continued yesterday when Tim Breedon, chief executive of Legal &amp; General, one of Britain's largest institutional investors, told the Treasury that the block on any shareholder pay-outs agreed to by banks participating in the government's bail-out plan was a \"weakness\" in the bail-out.</p> <p>If the banks were able to keep paying their dividends, as well as making the interest payments on the government's preference shares, City institutions might be more willing to buy some of the bank shares that the government would otherwise be left holding, Breedon added.</p>",
  "<h2>Waterford Crystal staff fight factory closure plans</h2> <p>Trade union leaders vowed yesterday to fight plans that will almost spell the end of glass-making at Waterford Crystal's last remaining factory in Ireland. With the prospect of 280 job losses, leaving only 70 staff at the plant at Kilbarry, besides those employed at the firm's visitor centre, unions blamed bad management for bringing home-grown manufacture to a standstill. Unite members were expected to lobby the taoiseach, Brian Cowen, and government officials over the cuts. \"Alongside Guinness [Waterford crystal is] one of the last iconic brands,\" said Unite's regional organiser, Walter Cullen. <br><strong>Press Association</strong></p> <h2>Google could make \u00a3100 million from new gambling ad law</h2> <p>Google is to relax its global ban on gambling adverts for web users in England, Scotland and Wales.

Analysts reacted positively to the group's comments on global demand for handsets this year - Nokia said it expected phone volumes to rise by 10.5% to 1.26bn in 2008 as sales in emerging markets offset falling demand in western Europe - and expressed relief that it had not delivered a gloomy outlook for next year. <br><strong>Dan Milmo</strong></p>",
  "<p>The image of the Chinese superman flying in to save western capitalism is one we are likely to see aired a good deal (If China spends its trillions, recession could be averted, October 15). Various notions have been advanced of how China might splash out, including a huge loan to Washington with IMF-style strings, to establish its status as a responsible superpower which bailed out the US and saved Americans from repeating their sins.</p> <p>However, whether Beijing, under its present consensus-seeking leadership, is ready to move to centre stage in this way must be doubted. While the leadership stresses its willingness to help with global rescue plans, its first priority is domestic. Its system protects it from the kind of financial woes that have hit the west, and the contribution of exports to growth is often overstated. But the Communist party plenum which ended on Sunday warned of \"hardships\" ahead, and the PRC's global involvement means it would be significantly affected by a downturn in its main markets in Europe and the US.</p> <p>Even before the present crisis hit, the Shanghai stock exchange had nosedived, small factories were closing down and the government had slowed the appreciation of the currency to help exporters. \"Caution and flexibility\" were laid down by the plenum as the policy guidelines, along with the focus on protecting growth which has become the watchword since March. The consumption Beijing is concerned with is that of the Chinese, not westerners. If it spends its trillions, it will be at home, not in propping up others. After some nasty experiences with investment in the west, \"caution\" points to going on with the traditional purchases of US bonds rather than a superman act.<br><strong>Jonathan Fenby</strong><br>London</p>",
  "<p>It was John McCain's best performance of the three presidential debates. He kept attacking, kept his opponent on the defensive and kept the initiative, booming at one point: \"I am not President Bush.\" But it was not enough. The more Mr McCain laboured on Wednesday night to paint Barack Obama in lurid colours - he accused him of extremism on abortion and class warfare on taxes - the more he appeared to make his opponent's case for him. The epithets may seem hysterical to European ears, although to large swathes of the US television audience, they are probably less so. But the blanket nature of the charge, the fact that if we are to take Mr McCain's words literally, Mr Obama is rotten to the core (he consorts with washed-out terrorists), speaks also of the accuser's frame of mind. The lack of judgment that Mr McCain has shown at key points in this campaign, and in his choice of running mate, is important. As president, he would be routinely called upon to make judgments about real terrorist threats, so the relish with which he invents imaginary ones is disturbing. </p> <p>Mr McCain came across as aggressive and cantankerous, the neighbour who would yell at kids skateboarding down his drive, the old man who loses his rag too quickly because of his heart condition. Mr Obama became by comparison cooler, younger, fitter and more cerebral - in a word, more presidential. Mr McCain's performance invoked pity, Mr Obama's respect.</p> <p>Mr Obama could have thrown a fair pile of dirt at Mr McCain's running mate, Sarah Palin. Invited explicitly by the moderator of the debate to do so, Mr Obama declined, praising her energy as a campaigner instead. In short, he was not playing that game, even though his television advertising tells a different story. Mr McCain may have warmed the cockles of supporters, like Ms Palin, who urged him to put the knife in and then twist it. But there is a cost to be paid in appearing too keen to finish off your opponent. In the heat of battle, Mr McCain lost sight of the two qualities that helped him defeat his rivals for the nomination, his honourable record as a soldier and his independence as a politician. In trying to give the Republican base the raw meat they craved for, Mr McCain forgot himself, and in so doing turned neutral, uncommitted voters away in droves.</p> <p>Cast the net wider, to the international polling commissioned by the Guardian and seven other leading newspapers in France, Belgium, Switzerland, Poland, Canada, Japan and Mexico, and the judgment for Mr Obama is starker still. He would win by a straight majority in six of the eight countries surveyed. In Britain, Mr Obama is ahead of his Republican rival by 64% to 15%. Of more concern to a future US president is the finding that only a minority in the countries surveyed describe relations with the US as friendly. This confirms the other source of anguish that is at the heart of this election. America has lost international standing among its natural allies such as Britain and France, and its immediate neighbours Mexico and Canada. This is the bequest of a president who launched two wars, could finish neither, and leaves office on the brink of a global recession. But it also has implications for the three remaining weeks of campaigning.</p> <p>It means that Americans are turning against the Republican candidate not just because he has been too closely associated with the failing economic policies of the ancien regime, although that is the primary reason for Mr McCain's slippage in the polls. The revolt is also caused by evidence that America has lost its place in the world and squandered the privileges it enjoyed to set the economic and military world order. This thought should trouble Europe, which has neither the political unity nor the military might to replace the US role on the world stage. Mr Obama will not easily be able to turn this round, if he is elected. But that he should be elected president, few around the world now dispute.</p>",

I refer not to the issues - the economy, the war and so on - but the political, strategic and organisational dynamics that give the impression of a campaign about to implode. The situation in Roanoke, and the surrounding area, exposes five central weaknesses with the McCain campaign thus far.</p> <p><strong>1) His <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/oct/03/uselections2008.sarahpalin1\">own supporters don't like him</a></strong>. Or at least they don't like him enough. This counters the dominant narrative of the primary season that Democrats were bitterly divided while the Republicans quickly rallied around their candidate. I have yet to meet a Democrat here who supported Hillary Clinton who bears a grudge against Barack Obama. That doesn't mean they don't exist. But Obama only won this town narrowly, I've met a lot of Democrats and they all seem to be behind him. On the other hand, the Republicans have no great love for McCain. They respect him - or at least they respect his military service. But most did not vote for him (Huckabee won Virginia and Roanoke) and they talk about him in much the same way that Democrats spoke about Kerry in 2004. He's the candidate they've settled for, not the one they wanted. They do however love Sarah Palin who has galvanised many into action. But at the end of the day huge support for the number two just doesn't have the same impact. <br> <strong>2) He has few effective surrogates.</strong> In the two and a half weeks that I've been here, the Democrats have had <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global/video/2008/oct/14/bill-clinton\">rallies and meetings with Bill Clinton</a>, Indiana senator <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2008/oct/06/uselections2008.barackobama\">Evan Bayh</a> (standing in for <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/deadlineusa/2008/oct/05/uselections2008\">Joe Biden </a>whose mother-in-law was dying) and former Democratic National Committee chairman <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/oct/01/uselections2008.virginia\">Terry McAuliffe</a>. On Friday, Barack Obama is coming. The Republicans have had no one and as of yet plan to have no one. If you cast about for those who might speak for him, you can see why that would be. Obama can count on his wife, Michelle Obama, Biden, Biden's wife Jill and the Clintons to speak for him. McCain could not send out his wife, Cindy, George W Bush or George HW Bush to stump for him. Indeed, for the first few weeks he would barely send Palin out on her own, either because she was not ready or was in preparation for her debate. So while the Obama camp has been covering huge amounts of electoral turf, getting free local television coverage and energising their supporters on the way, the McCain campaign has all too often been travelling in a pack and leaving little opportunity for anyone, including him, to come to a place like Roanoke. <br> <strong>3) Neither he nor Palin has been here. </strong>A look at the election results of 2004 shows that Bush won by racking up huge majorities in small county after small county which in the end more than compensated for his poor showing in the cities. He didn't just win them. He won them big. If McCain is going to win Virginia, he has to take the southwestern region of the state by a sizeable margin. At present, that is not going to happen. Local Democrats say that Obama needs to win 40% in this area to be viable in the rest of the state. A<a href=\"http://www.tricities.com/tri/news/local/article/latest_mason_dixon_poll_shows_s outhwest_virginia_favors_mccain_over_obama/14598/\"> poll taken 10 days ago</a> gave him 39%. Given other trends, it's almost certainly much higher now. A visit, particularly by Palin, would make a huge difference in a region like this. Instead they both went to Virginia Beach (see point 2) and then she headed to Richmond - a city he is never going to win.<br> <strong>4) He is being outspent and has been outorganised.</strong> Last month, Roanoke city, which is Democratic, saw more than three times the increase of registered voters as the county, which is heavily Republican. The Obama campaign has <a href=\"http://obama.3cdn.net/716d686803fcf88101_7gdymv24j.pdf\">48 offices </a> and a further 19 sub-offices in Virginia. The <a href=\"http://virginia.johnmccain.com/content/sitecontentmain.aspx?guid=\" 6e4ed930-3f71-\" 4f83-a7ca-42ea9e218a26\">McCain campaign has 21</a>. Obama has spent more than <a href=\"http://www.roanoke.com/politics/wb/180256\">twice as much as McCain in television ads in the region</a>. The combined effect of those advantages is that while Obama's message is constantly being relayed on the airwaves and in person while volunteers mobilise the base, the physical and political presence of the McCain campaign is at best patchy.<br> <strong>5) He shouldn't have to either come here or spend money here.</strong> Virginia has not voted Democratic since 1964. The last time before that was 1948. The very fact that McCain should be spending money, organising and campaigning here tells you just how much trouble he is in. In North Carolina, Indiana and most recently Missouri, Obama is encroaching heavily into what should be McCain's safest territory. He is forcing McCain to spend money and time in places that ought to be safe or risk losing them entirely. The last place a Republican presidential candidate needs to be thinking about three weeks before polling day is southwest Virginia. But if McCain doesn't think about it, he can't win the state. And if he doesn't win the state, it's difficult to see how he can win the country.</p>",
  "<p>Today, the Food and Agriculture Organisation's <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/getinvolved/worldfoodday/en/\">World Food Day</a> obliges the world and its leaders to consider the issue of global hunger. A particular theme this year is climate change and its impact on poverty and hunger. While the role of climate change is significant, the matter of political will casts a broader shadow across world hunger. This year's World Food Day is, as a result, somewhat hollow.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.irrawaddy.org/highlight.php?art_id=14410\">Burma</a> stands as a case study for the combined effects of poverty and hunger, climate change and politics. In short, the stresses created by these dynamics have created a collapsing system in which the majority of Burmese are in danger of being crushed.</p> <p>The actions of Burma's military regime represent a situation whereby climate change and its impacts on hunger are actively utilised for political gain. Currently, for instance, there are reports that the regime is creaming off 10% of post-cyclone aid coming into Burma in the wake of <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7408423.stm\">this May's disaster</a> as \"exchange transfer costs\". It's a clear case of profiting from the effects of climate change and hunger.</p> <p>Under the military, rural communities have been decimated by being forced to destroy vegetable and other staple croplands and to replace them with the regime's designated exportable cash crops, such as tea and biofuels.</p> <p>A life-threatening famine is emerging in Chin state, western Burma, for instance, while the junta does nothing. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/10/burma.famine\">Plagues of rats</a> gorging on a rare crop of bamboo flowers are razing community plots and destroying any remaining semblance of food security. Again, politics stands in the way of necessity.</p> <p>As the government elected in Burma's last free and fair elections, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Coalition_Government_of_the_Union_of_Burma\">National Coalition Government of the Union of Burma</a> is committed to raising Burma's understanding and action on climate change issues, both domestically and regionally, in direct contrast to the current regime.</p> <p>We will seek to aim funding, such as that which we may be able to attract from foreign donors and investors, to better manage Burma's exposure to climate change and to alleviate hunger. We would look to develop rural investment opportunities as a means of improving the sector's sustainability profile and to help rural communities develop strategies and technologies designed to better manage climate change.</p> <p>We aim to develop trade relationships that incorporate sustainability issues and would target 100% self-sufficiency in staple crops where sustainable. We would investigate options for improving regional trade exchanges and would discuss the implementation of early warning systems, identifying and tracking climate change focal points and developing joint disaster risk management strategies.</p> <p>Our approach to climate change and hunger in Burma would essentially be to focus on Burma's farmers \u2013 around 65% of the country's workforce \u2013 to help them understand climate change and how they might better manage their surroundings, while looking to energise the agricultural sector and industrialise and modernise the economy in environmentally and socially sustainable ways.</p> <p>Such goals might be well attuned to the World Food Day programme. The FAO have looked to encourage such agendas. We are making the connections between hunger and climate change the world community is encouraging.</p> <p>We might expect to be held up as a positive case for the World Food Day. Yet, our policies remain trapped in the black hole of Burma's untenable military regime and are themselves starved by the failure of international political will.</p> <p>Rather than emerging as a positive case study of a nation's approach to hunger and climate change, Burma is something of a black mark. Today, Burma stands as an example of how climate change and hunger, rather than being being tackled by the international community, are actually being <br>substantiated by inherent political weaknesses and shortcomings of the current methodologies.</p> <p>The global community remains thwarted by the military junta's stonewalling. As our country's rightfully elected government, we are denied government even as our people starve and climate change, one of hunger's creators, is ignored.</p> <p>While the broad agendas of World Food Day are worthy of support, no one can deny the political barriers which act as obstacles to activism around climate change and hunger alleviation. Were World Food Day instead focused on questions of political will and global political dysfunction, we might begin to get to the crux of the issue. It's a point the case of Burma proves only too well.</p>",
  "<p>There is nothing uniquely African about corruption \u2013 or war, or arms trafficking, or the power of petroleum to encourage excessively selfish behaviour among men. If any good could come of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/07/france\">Angolagate</a>, it might be this: a lesson for the many millions of westerners who still manage to delude themselves with the idea that Africans are somehow nastier and greedier (or, in the case of mainstream media and pop-star portrayals, simpler and sweeter) than the rest of us.</p> <p>Among those accused in the arms-to-Angola scandal is a long list of French businessmen and senior government officials, many of whom served during the presidency (1981 to 1995) of the late Fran\u00e7ois Mitterand. His own son, 61-year-old Jean-Christophe, is accused of \"complicity in illegal trade and embezzlement\" and of having received over $2.6 million in bribes. Yet I hear no moans and groans in Britain about the corrupt bloody French. Despite its name, Angolagate is more a reflection of French greed and French politics than Angolan corruption, even if several Angolans probably did also walk away with large wads of wonga.</p> <p>In 1993, just months after a first and very flawed election had collapsed the year before, the <a href=\"http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/60187963.html?dids=60187963:60187963&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Feb+13%2C+1993&amp;author=SCOTT+KRAFT&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&amp;desc=Renewed+Heavy+Fighting+Dashes+Hopes+in+Angola+Africa%3A+Prospects+for+peace+were+short-lived.+Foreign+governments+are+losing+patience+with+combatants.&amp;pqatl=google\">Angolan war escalated</a> considerably. The central highland cities of Kuito and Huambo were among the worst affected, split down the middle between forces loyal to the ruling Movimento Popular da Liberta\u00e7\u00e3o de Angola (MPLA) and the then rebel army, Uni\u00e3o Nacional para a Independ\u00eancia Total de Angola (Unita).</p> <p>Angolan President Jos\u00e9 Eduardo Dos Santos was desperate, and feared he would finally be defeated by his oldest and most brilliant enemy, Unita leader Jonas Malheiro Savimbi. So the story goes, he called up an old socialist comrade, <a href=\"http://sg.news.yahoo.com/afp/20081012/twl-angola-france-corruption-weapons-6b0205e.html\">Jean-Bernard Curial</a>, who also happened to be the Africa advisor to Mitterand's Parti Socialiste (PS). The networks swung into action, and soon huge arms deals were under way involving the Angolan, Slovakian and Russian governments. All almost well and good: the only sticking point was the conservative French ministry of defence, which favoured Savimbi's rightwing Unita over the still seemingly socialist MPLA.</p> <p>As Global Witness's <a href=\"http://www.globalwitness.org/media_library_detail.php/671/en/angolagate_trial_opens_global_witness_comment_\">Alex Yearsley</a> puts it:</p> <blockquote> <p>There was a double French policy concerning Angola, a hangover from the Cold War if you like. And those battles \u2013 between right and left, between who gets into the French presidency and who doesn't - have continued. This is how the Angolagate trial should be understood. The French political establishment are having their dirty laundry put on show in the death throes of a trial that was supposed to be about corruption, arms dealing and money laundering.</p> </blockquote> <p>With this in mind, it will be interesting to see how far President Nicolas Sarkozy will go to protect his <a href=\"http://www.france24.com/en/20080523-sarkozy-angola-mend-ties-angola-france\">new-found friendship</a> with Dos Santos. Observers in Paris expect the French investigating judge, Philippe Courroye, to subpoena senior Angolans - including the president - who have been named in the indictment, and accused of financially benefiting from the arms deals. But Sarkozy will not want to upset the Angolan leader, who heads what is one of Africa's largest oil-producing nations pumping out close to 2 million barrels a day.</p> <p>The trial is expected to last five months, which would push proceedings into March next year \u2013 the same year that marks Dos Santos' 30th in power, and the same year in which he has promised to hold presidential elections (the first in 17 years). The last thing he needs is details of backhanders and arms deals splattered across the newspapers. If he is embarrassed publicly, he will ensure that French interests suffer in Angola's oil, energy and construction sectors. Which is why we should be watching Sarkozy closely.</p> <p>Incidentally, earlier this month, Dr Edward George, an economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit, <a href=\"http://www.eiuresources.com/mediadir/default.asp?Criteria=FullName&amp;Locator=WORLD&amp;SearchTerm=%20&amp;TopName=Edward%20George\">reported that</a> the French presidency is alleged to have intervened in another case involving another African leader, this one being Cote d'Ivoire's President Laurent Gbagbo. Gbagbo's wife, <a href=\" http://allafrica.com/stories/200810100149.html \">Simone Gbagbo</a>, was linked to the 2004 disappearance of French-Canadian journalist, <a href=\"http://www.rsf.org/print.php3?id_article=28839\">Guy-Andr\u00e9 Kieffer</a>.</p> <p>Earlier this year, she and an Ivorian minister received a summons from a French court seeking to hear evidence from them. The court had also communicated with an anonymous witness who wanted to give evidence about Kieffer's disappearance. This all sounds like progress, except that the witness lost his nerve and refused to testify, citing pressure and intimidation from the office of the French presidency.</p> <p>All of this amounts to gloomy news for those Angolans who would like to see some measure of justice and equality introduced onto the Angolan political scene. They have just seen the MPLA take a landslide victory of almost 82% in legislative elections that were far from being truly <a href=\"http://allafrica.com/stories/200809270014.html\">free or fair</a>. The party, as Angolan writer Sousa Jamba told me, is \"above any criticism, and it will be a long time before the Angolan establishment will be ready for any scrutiny.\"</p>",
  "<p>A darkening sense of dread over global economic prospects dominated another miserable day for world stockmarkets as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/marketturmoil\">shares tumbled downwards</a> on fears that banking bail-outs may not be adequate.</p> <p>After Japan's Nikkei index suffered its worst fall since 1987, the FTSE 100 index slumped by 218 points to 3,861 with sharp falls on banking stocks and in energy firms, which were hit by lower oil prices.</p> <p>Dismal US figures on manufacturing output compounded the pessimistic mood.

We will pay more than necessary to attract the correct quality of people from outside. </p> <p>\"Poachers turned gamekeepers are very attractive to hire. The FSA, in relation to systemically important firms, was trying to do regulation on the cheap.\"</p> <p>The financial crisis of the past 15 months, Turner said, meant that the FSA was now freed from the charge that it was stifling the City with bureaucratic controls.</p> <p>\"If a year and a half ago, the FSA had wanted higher capital adequacy, more information on liquidity, had said it was worried about the business models at Bradford &amp; Bingley and Northern Rock, and had wanted to ask questions about remuneration, the fact is that we would have been strongly criticised for harming the competitiveness of the City of London, red tape, and over regulation.</p> <p>\"It (the crisis) frees one from the danger that one is going to be criticised in that over-sloganised way, which has been used for the past 15 years to cover up the defects in that argument.

  "<p>There's a poem written by a woman 10 years ago \u2013 one of Iceland's leading poets \u2013 <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingibj%C3%B6rg_Haraldsd%C3%B3ttir\">Ingibj\u00f6rg Haraldsd\u00f3ttir</a> \u2013 and it's about a meeting room full of men talking, drinking and smoking cigars. They make a lot of important decisions but after every meeting a woman comes and cleans up. </p> <p>This story was related to me over a coffee by Sif Gunnarsdottir, a director of <a href=\"http://www.visitreykjavik.is/\">Visit Reykjavik</a>, on a dreary Thursday morning in the city's central district. Although the poem is a decade old, it resonates strongly with the Icelandic government's decision to appoint two female executives to drag their banking system out of a cardiac arrest that was precipitated \u2013 it is widely claimed \u2013 by a group of 20 to 30 individuals (almost all men) who were in charge of a handful of high-profile investment funds and the country's main banks, all three of which have had to be nationalised.</p> <p>The move is as much a statement of intent as an attempt to put a stop to what has been a tumultuous few weeks for Iceland. </p> <p>El\u00edn Sigf\u00fasd\u00f3ttir and Birna Einarsd\u00f3ttir, the two experienced banking officials who have been appointed chief executive of New Landsbanki and New Glitnir respectively, are the flag-bearers of a new business culture that the country must adopt in order to salvage its reputation and guarantee future financial stability. With winter food shortages looming (\"We will still have sheep and potatoes\" is how one Icelander put it to me) and people paying others to take on their now prohibitively-expensive car loans, Iceland has been dealt a very real and harsh example of the importance of prudence in the face of ambition and greed.</p> <p>Decisions that could affect the wellbeing of a whole country can no longer be made by small groups in smoky rooms without due attention to wider responsibilities. </p> <p>A reduction in interest rates by the central bank will provide some relief for a country which, last year, purchased twice as many Range Rovers as the whole of Scandinavia. But inflation and lack of easy access to cash will soon reduce the positive impact this may have. It's a necessary move but not one that will dramatically spread confidence or respite.</p> <p>By grasping the nettle and indicating a very public change of direction, the Icelandic government will also gain a welcome respite from the heavy criticism that has erupted from a mixture of angry foreign governments, panicking <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/oct/13/savings-iceland\">Icesave</a> customers, distressed Icelandic citizens and worried local councils in the UK, all of whom stand to lose even more money if the crisis deepens. Bankruptcy would be catastrophic; not just for Iceland, but for Europe as a whole. Thankfully this now looks unlikely.</p> <p>A less constructive response to such criticism has been to register an <a href=\"http://www.icelandreview.com/icelandreview/daily_news/?cat_id=16567&amp;ew_0_a_id=313758\">official complaint</a> with Nato regarding the UK's decision to use anti-terror laws to seize Icelandic assets. This move will certainly appease a vast number of people who view Gordon Brown's actions as, at best very unwise, and, at worst, the catalyst for the economic breakdown of a whole country. However, it may not pay to revisit the subject following Alastair Darling's \u00a3100m olive branch loan but, if the money is being used to service Landsbanki's debt to the British public, then this is arguably just an extension of the blinkered self-interest already demonstrated so crudely by Gordon Brown. If the UK really wanted to help, people are saying, then why didn't it do so several weeks ago when the severity of the situation first became apparent?</p> <p>Perhaps, in crisis, Iceland has been forced to address the real issue troubling the world's economies \u2013 that of the need for a dramatic culture change. Rabid profit-seeking and an eternal search for exponential growth, driven by that metaphorical group of men in a smoky room, have dominated one chapter of global fiscal history and it's now up to the female of the species to tear up the old rule book, clean up the mess and start afresh with a different set of interests at heart.

He said a global action plan should be based on five principles: transparency, sound banks, responsibility, integrity, and global economic governance.</p> <p>The prime minister added that his proposal, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/oct/16/gordonbrown-economics\">unveiled on Wednesday</a>, for international supervision of the world's biggest banks should be implemented quickly. </p> <p>He called for 30 cross-border \"colleges of supervisors\" to be established by the end of the year, each of them to monitor the activities of the 30 biggest banks.</p> <p>European leaders such as Brown, Sarkozy, and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, sparred over who should take the credit for initiating the demand to overhaul world economic governance. </p> <p>Merkel said she was surprised by Brown who, on Wednesday, sprung seven pages of detailed proposals on the summit without warning, a few days after scoring the biggest coup of his premiership \u2013 the decision by 15 EU countries to adopt his blueprint for bailing out Europe's banks. The remaining 11 EU members have now followed suit.</p> <p>Despite the European leadership contest and palpable frictions among them, the burgeoning crisis has generated a rare mood of consensus in the EU behind swift and radical action.</p> <p>The crisis may have originated in America, but Europe should take the lead in sorting out the mess, the heads of government have concluded.</p> <p>\"There is now a preparedness to look at things today which previously was not there,\" said Barroso.</p> <p>Brown said he wanted the world summit to take place before the end of the year. Sarkozy called for a November summit and has signaled his preference for New York as the venue. But the Japanese prime minister, Taro Aso, told parliament in Tokyo that the situation was not yet bad enough to warrant such a step.</p> <p>Sarkozy admitted that there was no full agreement on how to proceed, but dismissed suggestions that a world summit should wait until a new US president was in the White House in January.</p> <p>\"We would otherwise have a meeting in the spring and that's much too late. It's going to be a bad situation. We must have a summit before the end of the year. Europe wants it. Europe will get it.\"</p> <p>Sarkozy added that since the rest of Europe and the Americans in part were copying Brown's template for dealing with the banking emergency, they should also act in concert on the economic crisis.</p> <p>Sarkozy singled out better banks supervisions, cracking down on tax havens, tighter monitoring of sovereign wealth funds and hedge funds and curbs on executive pay.</p> <p>Brown echoed much of this, declaring that executive pay \"must reflect the values of hard-working families. You do not reward excesses and irresponsibility.\"</p> <p>While the French and British leaders dominated the EU summit and vied to set a global agenda while seeking to bury their differences in a joint European approach, there is ample scope for divergence in the weeks ahead over the degree of regulation being sought and the direction of common economic policy-making.</p> <p>The EU summit ordered the commission to come up with proposals by the end of the year to safeguard Europe's industrial competitiveness, a demand that reflects Sarkozy's more protectionist instincts.</p> <p>Brown said a new world trade deal would spell the death of protectionism.</p>",
  "<p>Thousands of hedge funds are expected to go bust in the next few months, amid fears that the secretive sector of the financial industry will be the next to buckle under the pressure of global market turmoil. </p> <p>Tumbling stock markets and a reluctance among banks to do business with hedge funds has further worked against an industry known as much in recent years for multimillion pound bonuses and jet-set lifestyles as the increasing reliance of pension funds and other investors on its investment returns.</p> <p>Two major funds in the US revealed today they were under pressure. It is estimated that 20-50% of the 10,000 hedge funds worldwide are vulnerable to a squeeze on their funds.</p> <p>Highland Capital Management, a US fund that has seen its assets fall in value since March by almost a quarter, to $33bn (\u00a319bn), is expected to close its flagship Highland Crusader Fund and one smaller fund after suffering losses on high-risk loans. It was the world's largest non-bank buyer of leveraged loans last year, according to Bloomberg.</p> <p>Citadel Investment Group, one of the world's largest hedge funds, told investors that returns for one its major funds would swing wildly as it was battered by the markets. Its $18bn worth of funds have fallen by 30% in value this year, despite putting a third of the funds into cash. </p> <p>Recent figures from Hedge Fund Research revealed a 15% rise in the number of hedge fund liquidations.</p> <p>The prospect of a sharp downturn in the industry's fortunes follows 10 years of rapid growth, as wealthy investors and then institutions such as pension funds reaped supercharged returns. In 1990, there were 610 hedge funds worldwide; this year there were 10,233. Average gains in the late 1990s topped 20% a year. </p> <p>Short selling became a particular favourite as traders saw an opportunity to borrow shares in a firm and sell them in the expectation that the price would fall.</p> <p>Philip Falcone, who earned \u00a31.7bn last year from his Mayfair-based firm Harbinger Capital, is believed to have made \u00a3280m from shorting HBOS prior to its rescue by Lloyds TSB. </p> <p>To cope with the crisis, several hedge funds are expected to follow the example of RAB Capital, the beleaguered fund that lost millions of pounds in Northern Rock. Last month, it persuaded investors in its troubled Special Situations Fund to maintain their investments for three years, by threatening to liquidate the fund.</p> <p>Many of the industry's leading players have expanded rapidly in recent years, based on borrowed funds which they have used to multiply their gains. However, banks have become increasingly reluctant to lend for hedge funds to make bets, except at prohibitive interest rates.</p> <p>The collapse of Lehman Brothers has also hit hedge funds, many of which relied on the investment bank as a counter-party in complex trades with clients. Several funds are believed to be in financial trouble after being told they must wait to access funds locked up in the US bank.</p> <p>PricewaterhouseCoopers, the administrators for Lehman Brothers, who are demanding that \u00a38bn of funds be repatriated from New York as part of a rescue plan for the bank's London operations, have denied the hedge funds have access to accounts holding hundreds of millions of pounds.</p>",
  "<p>Just to set the record straight: Barack Obama is not an Arab. If you don't believe me, I have it on good authority \u2013 John McCain said so. When a woman in the audience told the Republican candidate that she feared Obama because he was the scariest of all creatures, an \"Arab\", the gallant McCain \u2013 who knows a thing or two about dodgy foreigners, having spent several years in captivity with them \u2013 assured her that the Democrat was nothing of the sort. </p> <p>And how does he know? Because Obama is \"<a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2008/10/11/supporters_jeer_as_mccain_calls_obama_a_decent_person/\">a decent family man</a>\".</p> <p>Being an Arab myself and having lived among them for much of my life, I can confirm that McCain is not just the candidate with the most experience in foreign policy, he has also proven himself, with this penetrating insight, to be the one with the most knowledge of foreign societies.</p> <p>Personally, I blame the whole sad situation on the pressures of modern life and the rat race. Family bonds are bound to break down when men are faced with the tough demands of building a career with a major multinational like al-Qaida. </p> <p>How many fathers can spend quality time with their wives and children \u2013 especially when they have four of one and two dozen of the other \u2013 when they have to spend sleepless nights formulating devious and bloody plans to destroy the free world, brainstorm creative viral marketing and recruitment campaigns, and get the execution just right so as to make a killing on global financial markets?</p> <p>Then, there are all the long business trips to distant places, like Tora Bora, and the gruelling but incomplete training modules, such as learning to fly but not to land, that keep many an executive up in the air indefinitely. </p> <p>Besides, Arab men are too ambitious for their families' good: they chase promotion day and night in the cut-throat business of martyrdom in the hope of gaining access to the executive club in the sky, with its 72 sexy personal assistants and rivers of gushing vintage wine. In the process, most fall by the wayside, burnt out, their nerves shot to shreds, while their families are left to pick up the pieces.</p> <p>As every good conservative knows, children are led astray when there is no father figure around the house. What kind of example is an Arab role model like Osama Bin Laden setting when he walks out on his family, joins a gang and goes so AWOL that not only social services but also the CIA and US army can't find him?</p> <p>Of course, some limp-wristed liberal is bound to claim that she or he personally knows Arab men who are loving husbands and doting fathers. Well, that's just a show put on for your benefit. Do you know what goes on behind closed doors, I ask you?</p> <p>Arab Americans may <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ali-eteraz/arabs-arent-decent_b_134688.html\">take offence</a> at McCain's generalisation and are bound to protest that the family is the cornerstone upon which Arab society is built, and that Arab men generally take family matters very seriously. But what would they know? Self-deception and keeping up false appearances are universal Arab traits.</p> <p>Yes, indeed, it must have been those delusional voices in my head that have persuaded my that my wife considers me a dedicated husband, my mum reckons I'm a loving son, and my siblings generally think that I'm a good big brother.</p> <p>Come to think of it, the legions of caring Arab fathers, generous uncles, indulgent grandfathers, and strangers who make little kids laugh in child-friendly public places that I have encountered over the years must have been figments of my imagination. Of course, too many Arab fathers are a tad traditional and old-fashioned \u2013 although there are plenty of modern ones, too \u2013 but does that mean they are not decent family men? Republicans, after all, have a tendency of equating tradition with decency, and modernity with decadence.</p> <p>Then again, it might be a grand conspiracy to convince the world that we Arabs are ordinary members of the human family, while we quietly take over everything. Liberals, you have been warned: let your guard down against those wily Orientals at your own peril.</p>",
  "<p>Department store House of Fraser, part owned by troubled Icelandic retail investor Baugur, is insisting it is not short of funds and would consider buying Baugur's stake if the shares are put up for sale.</p> <p>The retail chain, which has 65 stores and more than 8,000 staff, is 35% owned by Baugur. The retail specialist used loans from collapsed bank Kaupthing, which has now been taken over by the Icelandic government, to buy the stake.</p> <p>There has been speculation that some of the stores in the Baugur/Kaupthing empire are under increasing financial pressure. Last week, the All Saints fashion chain, which has 70 stores and 465 staff and is also part of the Baugur empire, temporarily lost its revolving credit facility and had to scramble to get its credit line restored.</p> <p>But House of Fraser issued a statement, saying it was in good financial shape: \"We would like to emphasise that House of Fraser has all the funding in place to operate successfully. We have minimal exposure to the tragedy that is happening in Iceland. However, should any of the debt or the minority shareholdings in House of Fraser be put up for sale, we will examine it on a case by case basis.</p> <p>\"With the quality of the business and what we have achieved to date, we have always had parties approach us trying to be part of the act. That has not changed. Our responsibility is to the long term future of the business and our employees, and we will always act in their best interest.\"</p> <p>The HoF comments came just a day after a similar statement was issued by Mosaic - the group behind Oasis, Karen Millen, Warehouse, Principles and Coast, which is owned 49% by Baugur and 20% by Kaupthing's private equity division. The Mosaic group operates more than 2,000 stores and employs 13,000 staff.</p> <p>Its chief executive Derek Lovelock said Mosaic \"does not require saving\". He added that the group had \"sufficient funding in place to meet all foreseeable obligations\" and the directors were \"examining all potential avenues to secure long term funding\".</p> <p>Private equity investor John Moulton, of Alchemy Partners, has been in contact with Mosaic and House of Fraser to express and interest in buying the businesses.</p> <p>Billionaire Sir Philip Green, meanwhile, is still attempting to acquire Baugur's debt, which could give him effective control of the entire Baugur empire, which also includes Whistles, Jane Norman, the Iceland supoermarket group, Hamley's, Wyevale Garden Centres and the Goldsmiths, Mappin &amp; Webb and Aurum jewellery businesses.</p> <p>He faces competition from other private equity groups, including the UK's Permira and US-based Texas Pacific.</p> <p>One executive close to one of the interested parties said: \"The Icelandic government is trying to get an auction going. But the whole thing is bogged down in committees.\"</p> <p>Another source close to the negotiations with the Icelandic authorities said there was unlikely to be a quick deal: \"It is a very complex situation. We are trying to disentangle who owns what and where, and find out who really calls the shots.\"</p>",
  "<p>A reputedly priceless Goya etching from the Disasters of War series was stolen last month from a gallery in the Colombian capital Bogot\u00e1. Visiting the exhibition in the Andean city days after the theft, I found a photocopy in place of Goya's Sad Premonitions, with an optimistic caption: \"Space reserved for the return of the work.\"<br> The Goya exhibition, on loan from Zaragosa in Spain, was at the Gilberto Alzate Avenda\u00f1o Foundation, in a colonial house in Bogot\u00e1's old quarter, whose narrow streets with brightly painted houses rise steeply into the Andean mist. The theft sparked debates about access to art, even a hoax claim by a terrorist group that turned out to be from a professor incensed by the high cost of ticket prices.</p> <p>Yet no one argued that the masterpieces were out of place. Goya's scenes of torture and massacre, with blindfold captives and smirking bystanders, could have been drawn from news reports of recent years in a country that has suffered South America's longest-running war. Almost two centuries after this graphic testimony of Napoleonic atrocities in Spain, viewers seemed mesmerised. Schoolchildren and art students clustered open-mouthed around the small works, or sketched furiously on their pads.</p> <p>The Goya exhibition coincided with two group shows of Colombian contemporary art that reflect sometimes disturbing aspects of the country's reality. On my third visit to the country in two years, I met writers, artists, film-makers and musicians who have formed part of a resurgence of contemporary arts in the country, which is to be celebrated this weekend in a cross-arts festival, Colombiage, at the Riverside Studios in London. Many are finding their own responses to a war that has involved guerrillas, paramilitaries and the army, and been funded in part by kidnapping and narco-trafficking. </p> <p>The Alcuadrado gallery was founded in 2003 to put on site-specific shows in abandoned or forgotten corners of Colombia's cities, from disused factories and parking lots to colonial churches. Without Remedy, a group show in a derelict hospital in Bogot\u00e1's barrio La Esmeralda, extends eerily through the dank concrete corridors and vacant wards of the Santa Rosa clinic. The show takes up five storeys.<br> One mischievously allegorical piece specially commissioned for the space, Jaime \u00c1vila's Silk Hands (2008), consists of velvet mice with red-bulb eyes. It was inspired by the artful dodgers downtown on the Carrera S\u00e9ptima, Bogot\u00e1's main artery, who lifted the artist's wallet. The dimly lit installation began with 200 mice; some, no doubt in a spirit of interactivity, were nicked. In one of the most disquieting yet powerful works, Return (2008), by Miami-based performance artist Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Arjona, the spectator steps though bloody puddles made by red ink, splattered at eye level around the walls of a ward, without knowing how the blood-like stains were formed. In the next ward, the performance artist repeats the child-like blowing of bubbles at the wall that created the effect, but this time with pure soap to expunge the horror. Later, in the gallery's sleek offices in a high-rise building in downtown Bogot\u00e1, the artist tells me, \"violence permeates and transforms everything.\"</p> <p>\"We think we can apply justice to it,\" Jos\u00e9 Arjona says, \"but institutions are the dirtiest places. I try to create resistance, to come back to innocence and transparency.\"<br> Some 2,000 people saw this exhibition in three weeks. Alcuadrado's shows are free, and its co-founder Juan Gallo Restrepo, who has lived in London and is an admirer of Charles Saatchi and the YBAs, says the gallery is breaking even owing to sales of artworks \u2013 more than half of which are to institutions including Tate Modern. There have been 15 exhibitions in five years. \"We're committed to showing work that shows the reality of this country,\" he says. Ironically enough, it may be the respite from urban terror of the past few years that has increased the audience for such art. Many of these artists grew up during a period of terrorist bombings in the cities, when drug cartels vied for control with the state and each other. The strong-arm \"democratic security\" policy of president \u00c1lvaro Uribe, in power since 2002, has made cities and main corridors safer. Yet in rural no-go areas, war continues. While the conservative government (accused of being involved in \"parapolitics\") claims that inroads against the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc) and demobilisation of paramilitaries following a controversial amnesty, the US-backed crackdown on narco-traffic is a war few here believe can be won. Despite the high-profile rescue of the French-Colombian politician Ingrid Betancourt and three kidnapped Americans (known here as the \"jewels in the crown\"), some 2,500 hostages are still held by the Farc and other groups. There is deep concern, and some resentment, that they may be forgotten.</p> <p>Such concerns are reflected in the art I saw. In the videos of Project for a Memorial (2005), the Cal\u00ed artist Oscar Mu\u00f1oz copies faces of the disappeared from news photographs, painting images with water on paving stones which vanish as the slabs dry. His frantic repetition evokes death, disappearance and the duty of memory in a losing battle with oblivion. In Miguel \u00c1ngel Rojas's 59-minute video Outline of Panic (2003), also in the show, the artist's latex-gloved hand forensically traces blood stains he found on a city pavement. Rojas earlier caused controversy with David (2005), a photographic installation of 12 images of a nude soldier with an amputated leg in the pose of Michelangelo's sculpture, first shown in a disused Hilton hotel in Bogot\u00e1. </p> <p><strong>As Juanes</strong>, Colombia's global rock star and anti-landmine campaigner, told me last year, three Colombians fall victim to landmines every day \u2013 the worst toll in the world. Juanes, a former heavy metal singer turned soulful rocker, lives in both Miami and Medell\u00edn, a town located north-west of Bogot\u00e1 in a temperate Andean valley.</p> <p>Medell\u00edn is also the hometown of South America's most famous artist, Fernando Botero, whose rotund sculptures dominate the square outside the Antioqu\u00eda museum, in a former town hall. But inside I find a startling exhibition on Displacement and Reparation, with almost 50 works, mainly by Colombian artists. An estimated 3.8 million Colombians are internally displaced \u2013 the largest such population outside Sudan \u2013 and their plight has a huge impact on big cities. Some sense a social timebomb. A group of <em>desplazados</em> recently occupied a park in affluent northern Bogot\u00e1, demanding money promised by the mayor. According to the museum's director of projects, Carolina Jaramillo Ferrer, \"people are blind to displacement - it's just a number. This is a way to open their eyes.\"<br> One work, Libia Posada's Cardinal Signs: Units of Measure (2008) consists of photographs of journeys mapped in ink on the legs of the <em>desplazados</em> who undertook them, many of whom are indigenous people. Other works question the official line that US-sponsored coca-eradication programmes cause no lasting damage to the land, saying that they are themselves a cause of displacement. Carlos Uribe's painting Horizons (1999) reproduces the heroic peasant couple of Francisco Antonio Cano's classic 1913 Colombian painting of the same title, but inserts a plane spraying defoliants into the pastoral idyll.</p> <p>Yet Jaramillo Ferrer also believes artists are taking stock of \"what we're losing on a cultural level \u2013 the richness of the heritage related to the land, which is sacred and irreplaceable.\" That sense of both loss and recovery echoes through the art.</p> <p>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.colombiage.com\">Colombiage</a>, a weekend festival of films, music and talks, is at <a href=\"http://www.riversidestudios.co.uk\">Riverside Studios</a>, London W6, on October 18-19 2008.</p>",
  "<p>The FTSE hit its lowest point in more than five years today as fears of a global recession sent world stockmarkets falling across Asia, Europe and the US. </p> <p>Shares in the UK's leading companies closed down 5.35% at 3861, the FTSE's lowest point since April 2003, following another wave of selling by investors as travel companies and oil giants were targeted. </p> <p>A batch of poor manufacturing figures from the US saw the Dow Jones index fall nearly 1% this evening, as the Federal Reserve reported US industrial production in September suffered its biggest drop since 1974. </p> <p>The Dow Jones had fallen by 43 points to 8532 by 6pm BST, giving up modest early gains but recovering from steeper afternoon losses. </p> <p>An influential regional factory output survey, from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank, compounded the gloom by reporting an 18-year low in factory activity. </p> <p>\"The Philly Fed data provides the first reliable lead into the October numbers and confirms that the meltdown in financial markets is being closely followed by a dramatic slide in real economic activity,\" said Alan Ruskin, the chief international strategist at RBS Global Banking. </p> <p>In Europe, Germany's DAX closed 4.9% lower and France's CAC-40 fell 5.9%, while Switzerland's central bank announced a multi-billion dollar bail-out of banking giant UBS. </p> <p>Traders said the FTSE and other markets were now gripped by concerns over a global recession, having emerged from a tumultuous fortnight as governments strived to prevent a systemic collapse in the banking industry. </p> <p>Shares in holiday companies TUI Travel and Thomas Cook fell by more than 20% as investors calculated that, with <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/16/unemploymentdata-economics\">unemployment </a> expected to hit 2 million people by Christmas, fewer families will be taking holidays next year. </p> <p>\"The main worry is not the bank bail-out plan but the fears of global recession,\" said James Hughes, a dealer at CMC markets. </p> <p>Heavyweight mining and oil stocks also fell in London, along with firms exposed to the housing market after building supplies firm Travis Perkins warned on profits. B&amp;Q owner Kingfisher saw its shares fall more than 9%, while the owner of the Build Center chain, Wolseley, dropped more than 17%. </p> <p>Royal Dutch Shell was more than 8% lower as oil companies were affected by concerns over the global economy, with rival BP down 4%. </p> <p>Earlier today, the panic selling that began on Wall Street yesterday evening spread around the globe as investors lost faith that Europe and America's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/08/creditcrunch.marketturmoil\">bank rescue packages</a> would stave off an economic downturn. </p> <p>In London, the FTSE 100 fell by almost 6% in the first few minutes of trading to just 3840.6, its lowest level during the recent crisis. Although it later bounced back, attempts at a more solid rally faltered after the Dow Jones maintained its downward trajectory this afternoon. </p> <p>The FTSE's performance followed an 11% plunge on Japan's Nikkei, its worst daily fall since 1987. </p> <p>There was little sign of optimism in the City this morning. Antonio Borges, a former vice-president of Goldman Sachs, warned that investors are panicking, selling shares in favour of cash. \"The markets are very, very volatile because we do have a crisis of confidence, so the slightest piece of bad news throws the markets into disarray,\" he said. </p> <p>One analyst warned that shares may have much further to fall. \"Unless something remarkable happens, it looks like the FTSE 100 will test the low of 3287 that it hit in March 2003,\" warned David Buik of BGC Partners. \"Regarding a recession \u2013 we are in it.\" </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/blog/2008/oct/16/recession-watch\">Jaguar Land Rover cut almost 200 jobs</a>, and Corus slashed steel production for the rest of the year by 20%. </p> <p>This follows a raft of evidence on Wednesday that the wider economy has been damaged by the financial crisis. </p> <p>Across the Atlantic, yesterday's 733 point plunge on the Dow Jones index was prompted by a shock drop in retail sales and a grim warning from Ben Bernanke. The Federal Reserve chairman said the frozen credit markets posed a big risk to the wider economy. </p> <p>\"By restricting flows of credit to households, businesses, and state and local governments, the turmoil in financial markets and the funding pressures on financial firms pose a significant threat to economic growth,\" Bernanke told the Economic Club of New York. </p> <p>The price of oil slipped again today, with a barrel of US crude oil falling another $3 to $71.73 on expectations of lower demand. </p> <p>Markets had rallied on Monday as the world's governments began taking action to pump capital into their struggling banks. But in Japan, where the Nikkei fell 11.4% to 8458, the prime minister, Taro Aso, said America's $250bn (\u00a3145bn) injection into the banks <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/16/creditcrunch-japan\">did not go far enough</a>. </p> <p>\"It was insufficient, and so the market is falling rapidly again,\" Aso said. </p> <p>Borges agreed that the optimism over the bail-out may have been misplaced. \"After the government guarantees, it is fair to expect that the banking sector will go back to a more normal state. The problem is, however, that this may have come a bit too late and, meanwhile, the consequences of the credit crunch are beginning to be felt across the economy,\" Borges told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. </p> <p>Hong Kong's Hang Seng index fell by 8.5%, with China's Shanghai Composite down almost 4% in late trading.</p>",
  "<p>European Union leaders have reasserted their ambition to lead the world in fighting climate change despite the growing economic recession and mounting rifts among its 27 governments.</p> <p>The French president Nicolas Sarkozy, who chaired the two-day meeting, warned EU leaders they would be held in ridicule if they abandoned their 18-month-old target of creating the world's first low-carbon economy.</p> <p>In March 2007, a few months before the sub-prime crisis provoked financial turmoil, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/mar/10/eu.greenpolitics\">EU governments pledged to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 20%</a>, take 20% of primary energy from renewables and reduce energy consumption through efficiency by 20% \u2013 all by 2020.</p> <p>But several heads of government, including Italy's Silvio Berlusconi and Poland's Donald Tusk, insisted during the fractious meeting that they were not in office then and threatened to refuse to be bound by the targets given the enveloping economic gloom.</p> <p>Insisting, however, that he had achieved unanimity, Sarkozy said the two-day summit had stuck to its timetable of agreeing the climate change package before the end of the year. \"I can confirm that the objectives remain unchanged and the calendar remains the same,\" he said.</p> <p>He told journalists: \"We cannot use the financial and economic crisis as a pretext for dropping it (the package).\" Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, EC president, added: \"We're not going to let up in the battle against climate change and there's no question of picking between the financial crisis and climate change.

Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Slovakia wanted at one point to scrap the December deadline.</p> <p>Germany and others want their heavy energy-intensive industries such as steel to be given a greater number of free pollution permits under the EU's flagship emissions trading scheme, rather than having to pay for them.</p> <p>Faced with a squeeze on their budgets as key economies move into recession and unemployment increases, most governments are worried by the sheer cost \u2013 amounting to tens of billions of euros \u2013 that the climate change package entails.</p> <p>A final summit communiqu\u00e9 masked these problems by declaring that the 27 leaders would decide in December on \"appropriate responses to the challenge of applying that package in a rigorously established cost-effective manner to all sectors of the European economy and all member states, having regard to each member state's specific situation.\"</p> <p>Sarkozy gave a sign of encouragement to the European car industry, which has been fighting EC plans to cut carbon emissions from all new cars to 120g/km from 2012 and has asked for a \u20ac40bn (\u00a331bn) bailout scheme to enable the shift to \"green\" technologies.</p> <p>The French president pointed out that the US government had given its three leading car-makers \u2013 General Motors, Ford and Chrysler \u2013 a $25bn (\u00a315bn) soft loan to re-equip their plants to produce more fuel-efficient, less polluting cars.</p> <p>Sarkozy insists that this puts the European industry at a competitive disadvantage. He said: \"Can you ask the European car industry to produce clean cars, change the whole industrial apparatus within a few months, without giving them a helping hand?\"</p>",
  "<p>Leading shares are now back below the lowly level they had reached before the weekend's dramatic \u00a337bn UK bank bail-out, with the initial two-day euphoric rise now more than wiped out.</p> <p>After another volatile day's trading, the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> has slumped another 218.2 points to 3861.4 \u2013 a 5.35% decline to its lowest level for five and a half years \u2013 on growing concerns about a prolonged global recession. On Monday morning, before the government's much-hyped bank rescue package was unveiled, the index was at 3932.1.</p> <p>The fall accelerated during the afternoon as Wall Street fell sharply after poor industrial production and jobless numbers. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down more than 200 points by the time London closed.</p> <p>Economist Charles Davis, at the Centre for Economics and Business Research, said: \"US industrial production fell by 2.8% in September, following a 1% decline in August. This was the largest monthly decline since 1974.</p> <p>\"The fall was partly due to the hurricane season and the strike at Boeing, but clearly also reflects the deteriorating economic outlook. With 159,000 jobs lost in September and unemployment at 6.1%, the Federal Reserve may well move again in an attempt to stimulate the contracting economy. Interest rates could well be cut by another 50 basis points before year end with the next meetings on October 28 and December 16.\"</p> <p>Commodities - notably base metals and oil - declined on fears of falling demand, especially following comments yesterday by mining group <strong>Rio Tinto</strong> about a slowdown in China. So miners were again among the day's main casualties. </p> <p><strong>Vedanta Resources</strong> ended 113.5p lower at 632.5p, while <strong>Kazakhmys</strong> closed down 47.5p at 289.25p. <strong>Xstrata</strong> lost 144p to 914p, while Rio was off 307p at \u00a320.50 on concerns that the $8bn stake held by China's Chinalco was caught up in the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Chinalco said in a statement it believed there was no basis under which its ownership of the shares could be challenged.</p> <p>Despite the global attempts to support the world's banks - Switzerland being the latest country to provide financial help - the mood among the financial sector was still gloomy. News of another $13bn credit crunch hit for Citigroup did nothing to help sentiment. Meanwhile Libor - the rate at which banks lend to each other - showed only a slight dip. Central bank efforts to unfreeze the money markets seem to be taking an inordinate amount of time to filter through.</p> <p><strong>Barclays</strong> closed 26p lower at 213.5p, even though Citigroup analysts changed their long standing sell recommendation to a hold, but hopes that the banks likely to take government help could indeed pay dividends to shareholders helped them avoid the worst of the declines. </p> <p><strong>Lloyds TSB</strong> edged down 0.2p to 150p, its takeover target <strong>HBOS</strong> was 1.6p lower at 84.1p while <strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong> closed unchanged at 65p.</p> <p>Insurers have become the latest concern for investors, given their exposure to the equity markets and concerns about their regulatory capital requirements.</p> <p>Goldman Sachs said in a note: \"Despite holding up well against the market so far this year, weaker capital markets and economic conditions are taking their toll on the insurers. While some uncertainty clearly exists for the sector, we note that insurers generally have lower leverage than banks, with better liquidity and more flexibility on liabilities.\"</p> <p>On specific stocks, it suggested taking profits in <strong>Standard Life</strong> - down 25.5p to 210p - and cut its recommendation from buy to neutral. On <strong>Aviva</strong> - 39p lower at 353p - the bank said: \"Following the payment of the 2008 interim dividend, unless market conditions improve in the debt and mortgage markets, we believe Aviva's future dividend is vulnerable.\"</p> <p><strong>Legal &amp; General</strong> lost 7.8p to 64p after a cautious trading outlook.</p> <p>Elsewhere, pub groups were hit by two factors: the prospect of a sustained consumer downturn and their hefty levels of debt. So <strong>Punch Taverns</strong> fell 36.25p to 163.5p, despite another move to buy back \u00a320m of notes within one of its securitisations, and <strong>Enterprise Inns</strong> ended down 26p at 103.5p.</p> <p>Holiday company <strong>TUI Travel</strong> lost 55.35p to 194.4p after its parent company TUI AG decided, for the moment, not to buy the 49% of the company it does not own.</p> <p>But analysts at Investec said: \"We do not think that this signals the end of bid speculation altogether. TUI AG retains the right to come back after six months \u2013 by which time the sale of its German shipping business will have completed.\"</p> <p>Rival <strong>Thomas Cook</strong> was also lower, down 44p to 145.2p on concerns about the consumer downturn.</p> <p>A profit warning from <strong>Travis Perkins</strong>, the builders merchant and owner of the Wickes DIY chain, sent its shares tumbling 150.75p to 330.25p. </p> <p>Larger rival <strong>Wolseley</strong> was also hit, down 60.75p to 285.25p as were B&amp;Q business <strong>Kingfisher</strong>, down 11.2p to 106.8p, and Homebase owner <strong>Home Retail Group</strong>, off 18.25p at 196.5p.</p> <p><strong>International Power</strong> fell another 17p to 219.5p after yesterday's news of a plant closure in Sicily caused by a fire, despite analyst suggestions it could be a bid target.</p> <p>Lakis Athanasiou at Evolution Securities, who has a buy recommendation and a 460p price target, said:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Price falls in International Power have been fuelled by two fallacies: one, that it faces refinancing/financial risk because of high gearing. This is untrue \u2013 it can repay all principal requirements to 2012 with internal cashflow, still maintaining healthy dividend growth and with lots of room to spare; two, falling crude prices significantly reduce its value. [This is] also untrue \u2013 it has limited exposure to reducing crude prices.</p> <p>\"At the current share price, International Power has become a bid target. There is appetite for the Asian and the Middle East assets with Far East utilities, or Suez. Continental European assets could be sold to renewable and other utilities. The UK assets would provide a ready platform for those utilities seeking to enter the UK market. Sale of US assets may be more problematic in current credit conditions, but value exists. Sale of Australian assets would however be difficult prior to a decision on CO2 allocations, which is due at start 2009.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Analyst Tina Cook at Charles Stanley was also positive. On the Sicily situation she said:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The timing of the incident is not ideal as it follows shortly on from an extended outage at Rugeley due a failed component. The impact is expected to trim underlying earnings per share in 2008 by 0.8p to 1.0p. But, to put this into perspective, consensus EPS is 27.6p.</p> <p>\"Amidst ongoing uncertainty about the health of the global economy, investors are likely to seek refuge in safe haven utilities with regulated cashflows and higher yields, potentially leading to further share price weakness. Our recommendation is accumulate with near-term risk on the downside.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>But a positive update from temporary power supplier <strong>Aggreko </strong>pushed its shares 38.5p higher to 438.5p.</p>",
  "<p>Two months after the Georgia crisis, western policymakers are still scratching their heads over what to \"do\" about Russia. The Bush administration, in financial meltdown and heading for the exit, has little useful to say. White House hopefuls Barack Obama and John McCain both identify a reviving challenge from the east but give few clues to how they would deal with it.</p> <p>In the <a href=\"http://elections.nytimes.com/2008/president/debates/transcripts/first-presidential-debate.html\">first presidential debate</a> Obama acted tough, warning that \"a resurgent and very aggressive Russia is a threat to the peace and stability of the [Caucasus] region ... You cannot be a 21st-century superpower and act like a 20th-century dictatorship.\" McCain's rhetoric was similarly offensive. \"Russia has now become a nation fuelled by petrodollars that is basically a KGB apparatchik-run government,\" he said.</p> <p>European countries that rely on Russian energy but fear Moscow's authoritarian new nationalism are less acerbic but no less critical. Yet despite numerous policy reviews ordered after the South Ossetia-Abkhazia conflicts erupted, they also lack a coherent idea of how to proceed.</p> <p>While all parties agree on the undesirability of a new cold war, the EU has again <a href=\"http://www.euractiv.com/en/enlargement/eu-russia-pact-hold-georgia-talks-collapse/article-176445\">delayed a decision</a> on resuming strategic partnership negotiations with Moscow. Yesterday, European-sponsored Russia-Georgia \"peace\" talks in Geneva were suspended almost before they got started. Next month's planned EU-Russia summit looks like being a very awkward affair.</p> <p>American name-calling and European waffling have further antagonised Moscow, making matters worse. Possibly in reaction to this, influential Russia experts in Washington are now arguing with growing force that the stand-off cannot be allowed to deteriorate \u2013 and that the next US president and his allies must take a more constructive, less antagonistic approach, if only out of enlightened self-interest.</p> <p>\"The danger is the next administration, whoever is in charge, may be trapped in a confrontation with Russia, with Georgia at the top of the agenda, when many other issues, such as Iran, should be taking precedence,\" a US government intelligence analyst said.</p> <p>\"Bilateral relations are really bad, as bad as most people can remember. They won't improve until after the elections, and perhaps not then. Georgia is not necessarily over and we're worried about Ukraine. It's possible the Russians will come up with some kind of legal claim to Sevastopol [where Russia's Black Sea fleet leases a base]. Nato membership for Georgia and Ukraine is a red line for Russia but both Obama and McCain are pushing for it,\" the analyst said.</p> <p>Joining the fray, two former US secretaries of state, Henry Kissinger and George Schultz, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/07/AR2008100702439_pf.html\">warned</a> recently \"this drift towards confrontation must be ended\". They said the <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/04/20080406-5.html\">strategic framework</a> adopted by George Bush and the then Russian president Vladimir Putin in Sochi in April this year was a basis for rebuilding ties based on mutual interest. Global non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, energy, climate change, and cooperation on ballistic missile defence were all pressing issues requiring enhanced cooperation.</p> <p>Kissinger and Schultz also argued the problem should be kept in perspective. Russia was not as powerful, militarily, economically or demographically, as it might seem and Russian leaders knew this. \"What they have sought, sometimes clumsily, is acceptance as equals in a new international system rather than as losers of a cold war to whom terms could be dictated.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.carnegieendowment.org/publications/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=22178&amp;prog=zru\">Calls for a new start</a> based on mutual respect have also come from six former US and Russian ambassadors, including Thomas Pickering and Yuri Dubinin, who issued a statement urging \"joint work on global issues where our two nations have the responsibility to lead\". In particular, they said, the two countries urgently needed to update their strategic and other arms controls agreements.</p> <p>Analysts say significant damage inflicted on Russia's economy and businesses by the global financial crisis, and to a lesser degree by Georgia-related western disinvestment, may have sobered Putin and his protege-president, Dmitri Medvedev. The crisis has helped drive home the increasing interdependence of Russia and the west, whatever hostile postures politicians on either side may adopt from time to time.</p> <p>It was no good Condoleezza Rice, the current US secretary of state, expecting Russia's help on Iran or North Korea while attacking it for safeguarding what it saw as legitimate regional interests, wrote <a href=\"http://www.carnegieendowment.org/publications/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=22206&amp;prog=zru\">Masha Lipman</a> of the Carnegie Endowment's Moscow Centre in the Washington Post. Her successor needed to be more imaginative. \"The current approach \u2013 seeking to punish aggressive, defiant Russia but working with Moscow in vital areas of common interest \u2013 is not sustainable.\" Lipman went on: \"US anger is only making things worse. The risk of Russia slipping towards an isolationist course and a militarised economy is growing \u2026 The foundations of US policy towards Russia must be revised.\"</p>",
  "<p>The oil producers' cartel, Opec, has called an emergency meeting for next week after the oil price fell to its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jul/11/oil.commodities\">lowest level </a>for 14 months.</p> <p>Members have been calling for production cuts to halt the slide in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/oil\">oil</a> which has slipped to less than $70 (\u00a341) after hitting an all-time high of $146 in July.</p> <p>The Nigerian oil minister, Odein Ajumogobia, said today that the meeting called for next Friday in Vienna, which brings forward the cartel's regular summit by three weeks, was an opportunity to consider options regarding the world oil price. </p> <p>But he said no course of action had yet been proposed. \"I regard it as an exploratory meeting to review facts and options. Not even tentative proposals have been discussed at this stage,\" Ajumogobia told Reuters. </p> <p>Opec, which produces more than 40% of the world's oil, said this week that oil consumption in developed countries fell by more than 1m barrels a day in September, compared with the same month last year, although developing countries increased their demand by 1.2m barrels per day over the same period.</p> <p>The prolonged slump in the oil price prompted the prime minister, Gordon Brown, to urge retailers to cut petrol prices as he warned that motorists \"expect\" to see a change on UK forecourts. \"I think the public know that, when oil prices go up, it is reflected very quickly in the petrol pump price. What we want to know is that when oil prices come down that is also reflected in the pump price,\" he said.</p> <p>Analysts said demand for oil was weakening amid a broad economic slowdown. \"Economic weakness is hitting the stock and oil markets, but the oil price fall is also reflecting a lack of demand,\" said Francisco Blanch, the head of commodity research at Merrill Lynch. </p> <p>Motorists and air passengers have benefited from the recent drop in oil prices, with unleaded petrol falling below \u00a31 per litre for the first time this year on Asda and Morrisons forecourts and British Airways and Virgin Atlantic slashing some fuel surcharges. </p> <p>However, UK households were warned by British Gas there will be no immediate fall in gas and electricity bills because wholesale gas remains more expensive than it was last winter. Gas is trading at 80p per therm against 48p for the same period last year. Dual fuel customers at British Gas pay an average of \u00a31,317 per year, an increase of \u00a3404 since January. </p> <p>\"The falls from the absolute highs are welcome, but they are still running two-thirds higher than they were last winter, which is the issue we are all facing,\" said a spokesman for Centrica, the owner of British Gas.</p> <p>Commodities prices also fell amid fears about the global economy. Copper, used in the construction and power industries, slumped to a 33-month low while grain futures also fell.</p>",

  "<p>Europe's leaders know where they want to be when it comes to tackling global warming. The problem is they don't know how to get there.</p> <p>President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, running a two-day summit of EU leaders which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/oct/16/climatechange-carbonemissions\">ended in Brussels today</a>, hoped to propel Europe towards a December deal. Instead, he has set the stage for a Christmas showdown.</p> <p>It's the 20/20/20 vision, as they say in Brussels when referring to the aim and the deadline. The idea, according to the programme drafted by the European commission and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/mar/10/eu.greenpolitics\">endorsed by all 27 leaders</a> at another summit in March last year, is to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 20% on 1990 levels by 2020 and for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/jan/23/climatechange.eu1\">20% of Europe's energy mix to come from renewable sources</a> by the same date.</p> <p>That's the end. And the means? Four pieces of European legislation that turn the aims into legally binding commitments and a highly complex system of \"burden-sharing\" between 27 countries detailing what each country has to do to enable Europe as a whole to meet the renewables target.</p> <p>The heart of the system, hailed by European leaders last year as pioneering, radical, and exemplary, is the European <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/emissionstrading\">emissions trading system</a> (ETS) which compels companies and industries to buy permits to pollute at auction, thus providing them with incentives to save cash by cleaning up their acts. This is to supply the bulk of the carbon dioxide cuts.</p> <p>Sarkozy, Gordon Brown, Manuel Barroso et al argued today that the goals were sacrosanct, that the summit's success was to reaffirm adherence to the 20/20/20 targets and not to let the December deadline for a deal slip.</p> <p>But anything less would have been a disgrace, turning Europe's leaders into a laughing stock, and shattering the chances of Europe leading the way to a post-Kyoto global programme at an international conference in Copenhagen a little more than a year from now.</p> <p>The devil is in the detail. The gigantic exercise in horsetrading is already being wrecked by special pleading everywhere you look. And two big things have taken place and shaken resolve since the outline pact was agreed last year - first the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/globalrecession\">financial meltdown</a> morphing into a broader European slump is feeding the feeling that Europe will simply not be able to put its money where its mouth is on climate change; secondly, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/biofuels\">biofuels</a> (which under the scheme are supposed to supply 10% of all road transport fuel by 2020) are now seen, for at least the next 15 years, as being part of the problem rather than the solution.</p> <p>Step up Silvio Berlusconi. The Italian leader can always be relied upon to supply the drama, tragic or comic. \"I did not sign up for this last year because I wasn't prime minister,\" he told Wednesday evening's dinner. So count Italy out. \"Our companies are in no condition to take on costs like those we thought about last year.\" </p> <p>Then eight new-ish EU countries in central Europe, led by Poland, voiced their distress, deploying the v-word. Poland would veto, said Radek Sikorski, the foreign minister in Warsaw. They were being penalised for being highly dependent on dirty coal. They would end up being hooked on Russian energy supplies and vulnerable to political blackmail. They want the costs entailed in the burden-sharing to be weighted more towards wealthy western Europe.</p> <p>The Poles and the Italians were the main whingers at the summit. But they are in good company. The mighty German car industry is aghast at the prospect of being <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/09/transport.greentech\">forced to cut CO2 emissions</a> by around 17% within three years for every new car.</p> <p>And in the scheme for trading in pollution permits, there are widespread fears that Europe will simply export jobs and industries to cheaper and less regulated parts of the world without affecting climate change one jot.</p> <p>This is so-called \"carbon leakage\" arising from energy-intensive industries such as cement, steel, and aluminium complaining they will be disadvantaged towards rivals outside Europe by having to pay for the permits. The French and the Germans want to give them their permits for free. Few others agree.</p> <p>Sarkozy has got 10 weeks to broker a deal. If he fails, the new laws won't be in place by next spring. They will have to await a new European parliament elected next summer, a new European commission appointed next autumn. Europe's credibility will be in tatters.</p>",
  "<p>A couple of years ago I stood on the steps of the Lincoln memorial in Washington DC looking down on the monumental heart of the world's most powerful nation. It was a tragic vista. It was Veteran's Day, and in the deep-cut rift of the Vietnam war memorial, just out of sight, grown men were crying. Soldiers in desert fatigues from Iraq were there too, and from the Lincoln Memorial you could see, against the backdrop of rectangular pools leading to the white needle of the Washington obelisk, one of these young veterans being wheeled across the park, a double amputee. </p> <p>Inside the Lincoln memorial, the colossal statue of a president assassinated for advancing human rights seemed a majestic indictment of modern America. Now, the years of tragedy may be coming to an end. Forget the economic storm clouds for a moment. Who could have guessed, standing at Lincoln's feet that day, America might be on the verge of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/uselections2008\">electing a black president</a>? </p> <p>Global bully, terrorist state - so many things have been said of America in recent years. Even its superb fiction was unjustly criticised by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/oct/01/nobelprize.usa\"> Horace Engdahl, the permanent secretary of the Nobel prize committee</a> a couple of weeks ago, as if Thomas Pynchon deserves to go down with George Bush. Anyone who has spent any time there (or simply read an American novel) knows most of this rhetoric is garbage. No nation is as simple as the one dreamt up by anti-American cliche. You just know the people who pen such attacks will shut down their laptop and go and watch The Simpsons, without seeing the contradiction. </p> <p>But equally, anyone who has spent much time in the US knows its true shame. Racism is America's scar, its disease. A nation that fought a civil war over slavery and, even after that, never properly acknowledged its debt to the children of slaves or strove to give true social equality to African-Americans is still a \"house divided\", as the man whose statue looms above Washington warned. </p> <p>I've got to be honest - I was totally pessimistic that Barack Obama could defy this legacy. To walk through American cities, not just in the south but even somewhere like New Haven, Connecticut, is to be scared by this society's racial rift. But it looks like the impossible is about to happen. Obama's lead looks unbreakable. We are about to see the greatest moment in American history. What will this do to world culture and world opinion? It will be like switching on a light. Sanity will return. Hope will return. Even the backdrop of world recession will not diminish this moment. If Obama wins, it will be the blossoming of the American constitution's broken promises. Lincoln's statue will smile.</p>",

  "<p>The government today committed the UK to cutting greenhouse-gas emissions by 80% by the middle of the century in a bid to tackle climate change.</p> <p>In a move that was widely welcomed by environmental campaigners, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/oct/03/climatechange.energy\">Ed Miliband, the new energy and climate change secretary</a>, said that the current <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/oct/16/11\">60% target would be replaced by the higher goal in the climate change bill</a>.</p> <p>Miliband told MPs that the tough economic conditions were not an excuse to \"row back\" on the commitment to tackle global warming.</p> <p>He accepted the recommendations of the government-appointed <a href=\"http://www.theccc.org.uk/\">Climate Change Committee</a>, chaired by Lord Turner, which said last week that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/oct/07/carbon.emissions.targets\">UK ought to commit to an 80% reduction from 1990 levels</a> for all greenhouse gases and covering all sectors.</p> <p>He also pledged to amend the energy bill to create \"feed-in tariffs\", allowing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/jun/21/renewableenergy.carbonemissions\">small-scale energy producers</a> \u2013 such as homes with wind turbines or solar panels \u2013 to sell electricity at a guaranteed price.</p> <p>And he issued a warning to energy companies to act \"in a satisfactory way\" to reduce charges for customers with pre-payment meters and those not connected to the gas main.</p> <p>He said the government expects \"rapid action or explanation to remedy any abuses\" and warned if the firms do not act then ministers would consult on legislation to prevent \"unfair pricing\".</p> <p>Dr Doug Parr, Greenpeace's chief scientist, said: \"This is a hugely encouraging first move from the new climate change secretary. In a decade in power Labour has never adopted a target so ambitious, far-reaching and internationally significant as this. </p> <p>\"To meet it will require determined action from Gordon Brown and every one of his successors for the next four decades. Hard choices will be made that will touch every Briton, but it can and must be done.\" </p> <p>He added: \"Ed Miliband obviously understands the urgency of the threat we face from climate change. He is absolutely right to say Britain should set an example to the rest of the world in tackling this issue, and we will support him wholeheartedly if the decisions he takes in the coming weeks and months genuinely reflect this ambition.\" </p> <p>Ruth Davis, the head of climate change at the RSPB, said: \"This is one of the most far-sighted and far-reaching climate change initiative any government could take and is testament to the efforts of campaigners.\"</p> <p>Andy Atkins, Friends of the Earth's executive director, said: \"Miliband's admission that pollution from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/oct/15/climatechange-carbonemissions\">international aviation and shipping will be dealt with outside the bill</a> is a sign that these industries are being picked out for special treatment yet again.<br> \"The Committee on Climate Change made it clear that we have to reduce all carbon emissions by 80%. We cannot leave the cuts in aviation and shipping emissions to chance.\" Greg Clark, the shadow climate change secretary, also welcomed the announcements. He said: \"The choice between aggressive and ambitious action on carbon reduction and a successful, powerful economy is, in fact, not a choice at all - they are one and the same.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/15/greenpolitics-energy\">Miliband, making his first statement to the Commons as head of the newly created department</a>, said: \"In tough economic times, some people ask whether we should retreat from our climate-change objectives.</p> <p>\"In our view it would be quite wrong to row back and those who say we should misunderstand the relationship between the economic and environmental tasks we face.\"</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/stern_review_climate_change.htm\">2006 Stern report</a> showed that the costs of doing nothing \"are greater than the costs of acting\", he said.</p> <p>The climate change bill would be amended to set the higher target, which \"will be binding in law\".</p> <p>Miliband said: \"However, we all know that signing up to an 80% target in 2050 when most of us will not be around is the easy part. The hard part is meeting it and meeting the milestones that will show we're on track.\"</p> <p>The Climate Change Committee will advise on the first 15 years of carbon budgets in December, \"national limits to our total emissions within which we will have to live as a country\".</p> <p>The announcement on feed-in tariffs will be welcomed by Labour backbenchers, who staged the biggest revolt of Gordon Brown's leadership over the issue.</p> <p>In April, 35 backbenchers rebelled on the issue during debate on the energy bill, with two more Labour MPs acting as tellers.</p> <p>Miliband said: \"Having heard the debate on this issue, including from many colleagues in this house, on this side of the house and on others, I also believe that complementing the renewables obligation for large-scale projects, guaranteed prices for small-scale electricity generation \u2013 feed-in tariffs \u2013 have the potential to play an important role, as they do in other countries.\"</p> <p>Last week Ofgem, the energy regulator, highlighted \"unjustified\" higher charges for 4 million customers without mains gas.</p> <p>The regulator also believes that many homes using pre-payment meters - often the poorest customers - are being \"overcharged\".</p> <p>Miliband said: \"Unfair pricing which hits the most vulnerable hardest is completely unacceptable. I made that clear to the representatives of the big six energy companies when I met them yesterday.</p> <p>\"I also told them that the government expects rapid action or explanation to remedy any abuses. I will meet them again in a month to hear what they have done.\"</p> <p>He added: \"If the companies don't act in a satisfactory way, and speedily, then we will consult on legislation to prevent unfair pricing differentials.\"</p> <p>Miliband said the measures announced today were part of an energy and climate change policy \"that is fair and sustainable, which meets our obligations to today's and future generations\".</p> <p>Clark said there had been a \"decade-long void\" in the government's policy towards energy, in which \"successive ministers have looked the other way rather than address the issue of future energy needs\".</p> <p>He welcomed the acceptance of Turner's 80% target, saying: \"We have always said that we should be guided by the science on that matter.\"</p> <p>But he called for the target to be kept under constant review, saying that just eight years ago 60% was considered to be the right number.</p> <p>Clark also pressed Miliband to \"lead the world\" on carbon capture and storage by committing to three UK-based demonstration projects and said smart metering should be introduced for microgeneration.</p>",

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.fao.org/getinvolved/en/\">World Food Day</a> gives us all a chance to think about the state of Britain's food system and how our eating fits into the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/food\">world of food</a>. The outlook is sobering.</p> <p>World figures on malnutrition show a rise after decades of fall. Yet we here in the UK are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/oct/07/nhs.obesity\">overeating our way to ill-health</a>. We think of food problems such as crop failures, droughts and floods happening far away, but give less attention to how our food supply chain has a large ecological footprint. Calculations vary but if everyone ate like us, we'd need three or four planets.</p> <p>The harsh reality is, that if we don't make changes to the food system soon, a major food crisis will hit. This isn't a problem for others. It's our problem. UK politicians need to push food policy up their priority list fast. </p> <p>World food systems must address what colleagues and I call the New Food Fundamentals. These are: less oil; <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climatechange\">climate change</a>; <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/water\">water</a> (floods, stress and shortages); <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/biodiversity\">biodiversity</a> reduction; massive urbanisation; labour shortage on the land; population rising to 9 billion by 2050; the impact of changed diets (from affluence) on health; and excessive production of meat and dairy (both heavy uses of water and grain).</p> <p>Although there's just about enough food to feed everyone at the moment, it's unequally distributed within and between countries meaning that obesity and malnutrition co-exist. There is a food gap here in Britain. Think <a href=\"http://www.jamieoliver.com/rotherham/\">Jamie Oliver's TV programmes on Rotherham</a> versus somewhere like Mayfair.</p> <p>We need a new, detailed policy direction. There are signs that this is being recognised in Whitehall. The Cabinet Office <a href=\"http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/strategy/work_areas/food_policy.aspx\">Food Matters</a> paper in July set out a new direction, centred on lowering carbon and nutrition. That's a start. But we also need to emulate the French and US and unashamedly rebuild growing capacity here, too. It's dropping fast from a peak in the mid 1980s, when we produced 80% of foods consumed here that could be grown here. Now it's near 60%. Why are we using others' land to grow food we could grow here? The Treasury is fixated on reforming the common agricultural policy by which it means cutting budgets. A new initiative is needed, to create a common sustainable food policy, based around sensible land use and health.</p> <p>The new food policy has to produce more food from less land, be more equitable and improve public health. This requires new skills and R&amp;D designed around sustainability. Colleges of agriculture and universities ought to be central to that. A low-carbon, water-secure, technologically appropriate, oil-reducing, health-enhancing, socially just food system cannot be left to chance. It needs investment, policy direction, vision. </p> <p>Experiments are popping up all over the UK of more local, community-based, connected food supplies. In our own lives we can change our eating and shopping habits. Avoiding food that takes a lot of resources to produce like meat and dairy products, and growing more food ourselves could change our food system from the bottom up. But individual action is not enough. It requires choice-editing, not personal choice. Urbanised Britain needs sustainable farming. The crucial thing is to take action now and not to wait until a crisis hits. That's the new political agenda.</p>",

  "<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.enn.com/business/article/38410\">Recession will cut EU carbon costs</a><br>Source: Deutsche</strong><br>Industrial carbon emissions will fall faster in Europe as result of a coming recession, cutting the demand for and price of emissions permits under the European Union's emissions trading scheme, said Deutsche Bank analysts. Lower carbon prices may hand an unexpected boost for politicians and green groups urging industry and bankers not to back down in the fight against climate change. Recession will cut industrial carbon dioxide emissions by about 100m tonnes in 2009 compared to 2007, from current installations, the research note said on Wednesday.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.enn.com/wildlife/article/38416\">Plight of the penguins</a><br><strong>Source: WWF</strong></strong><br>Half to three-quarters of major Antarctic penguin colonies \u2013 including the iconic emperor penguin, which was made famous by the blockbuster hit March of the Penguins \u2013 will likely experience significant decline or disappearance as a result of climate change, according to a new report from World Wildlife Fund (WWF). The WWF report released today, 2C is too much, shows that a global average temperature increase of 2C (3.6F), which climate models forecast could be reached in as few as 40 years, would sharply reduce sea ice coverage in the Southern Ocean where penguins live, breed and feed. The report concludes that such significant warming and sea ice loss would likely lead to the marked decline or complete disappearance of many penguin colonies, including 50% of emperor penguins and 75% of Ad\u00e9lie penguins.</p> <p><strong><br><a href=\"http://www.enn.com/pollution/article/38411\">Oil puts Brazil on collision course with future</a><br>Soure: Japantimes<br></strong>Brazil is poised to take its place among the world's petro-powers. Estimates of its new-found oil reserves place it in eighth place among oil-producing nations, ahead of Nigeria as well as Brazil's rival for influence in Latin America, Venezuela. Such newfound wealth is normally a source of celebration. But Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, perhaps fearing the infamous \"resource curse\" that has blighted the development of so many countries blessed with mineral wealth, is determined that the new oil wealth not be turned into \"nonsense.\" In 2007, huge oil deposits were discovered off Brazil's coast. Modest estimates put these reserves at around 30bn barrels. Credit Suisse and other investment banks say that 50bn barrels are available.</p>",
  "<p>Italy is tired of playing the ugly duckling in Europe. The time for daredevil tactics and unreliable leadership has gone. Today, Silvio Berlusconi and his coalition appear both less maverick and much more aware of international and European rules. There was a time when the financial markets were very suspicious about the anti-EU approach taken by previous centre-right governments, but no one can deny that the treasury minister <a href=\"http://www.giuliotremonti.it/\">Giulio Tremonti</a> is being very careful to avoid increasing Italy's enormous public debt. Moreover, his opinions on how to deal with the financial crisis by working with the rest of the EU are being taken seriously.</p> <p>Berlusconi, after having tried to create a European fund to save struggling banks, successfully persuaded the EU to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/09/europe.eu\">coordinate its response</a> to the crisis. He also pointed out how important it was to take action on <a href=\"http://www.euribor.org/\">Euribor</a> inter-bank lending rates in order to build banks' confidence. Tremonti 's financial plan promises big results for a small outlay. In fact, not a single euro has yet been allocated to it from the Italian budget. Though he says the government could intervene to bail out struggling banks, Tremonti has merely promised to guarantee bond issues made by banks during 2009 and for the next five years. The <a href=\"http://www.bancaditalia.it/bancaditalia\">Bank of Italy</a> will also exchange portfolio bonds with lower-quality bonds owned by other banks. Italy wants to send a reassuring message to Italian savers: the government is guaranteeing all deposit accounts during 2009, thereby bolstering the interbank fund guarantee. </p> <p>With these steps, Berlusconi and Tremonti have shown their ability to respond quickly to the crisis without leaving the market and the Bank of Italy in limbo.</p> <p>However, Berlusconi is conscious that the most important game is played outside national borders. Right now, at the European Council, he is committed in renegotiating European commission <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/environment/index_en.htm\">environmental policy</a>. The cuts in CO2 emissions that Europe is demanding risk crippling Italian industrial output.</p> <p>Italy wants Europe to support its own economies as well as ensuring its exports remain competitive. Tremonti has been trying to convince the European Parliament of the need to issue public debt bonds (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurobond\">Eurobonds</a>) to finance big European infrastructure projects. The rest of the Union tends to favour domestic solutions. Italy's willingness to work with other European countries is a new and welcome development.</p> <p>The G8 will meet in Italy next year. The aim of the Italian presidency will be to draw in five emerging economies \u2013 South Africa, India, China, Mexico and Brazil \u2013 with the aim of rewriting international monetary exchange rules. A new agreement in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretton_Woods_system\">Bretton Woods</a> tradition would take into account the rapid globalisation of the last decade.

Basically, some of the leading OEM/ODM suppliers are trying to develop global brand names because the OEM/ODM business -- making systems that sell under names such as Apple, Dell, HP and Lenovo -- can easily be moved to Chinese, Vietnamese and other cheaper manufacturers, leaving you with nothing.</p> <p>One of the keys to having a viable brand name is having innovative products, of which the Asus Eee PC S101 netbook (see <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global/blog/2008/oct/07/windows.microsoft\">Asus launches fashion-friendly Eee S101 MacBook Air killer</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2008/oct/07/gadgets.windows\">Picture special: A fashion-conscious look at the Asus Eee PC S101 launch</a>) is a good example. It invites people to pay a bit more for something that looks and feels much better -- and is noticeably thinner -- than the bog-standard netbook.</p> <p>Asus's design lab in Taipei has also been experimenting with natural materials that could give notebook PCs a more distinctive appearance. These should stand out from the crowd -- being distinctive both for Asus and its customers -- and could therefore appeal to more upmarket users.<br><br>Henry Yeh, general manager of Asus's Notebook Business Unit, describes them as \"high sense\" products: they should appeal to all your senses, but especially touch. \"When you touch a natural material, you feel warmth,\" he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338670998\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/10/16/1224160708794/JS-Asus_Bamboo_0073x.jpg\" alt=\"Asus bamboo notebook with lid open\" width=\"460\" height=\"306\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Asus started with leather, \"three or four years ago,\" and now has a bamboo model, which I tried in the design lab. It looks much better than I expected, and it certainly feels nicer than the usual plastic/metal notebook. </p> <p>The design does involve work beyond the veneer: Asus has tried to make sure the handrests stay cool, to protect the material. But how well it will age is anyone's guess.</p> <p>Yeh says Asus has built 200 units to introduce the bamboo notebook to the market. Then \"we will see customer feedback.\"</p> <p>It might be worth grabbing one as a collector's item, and they'd look nice in a design museum. But as a user, would you actually buy one?<br></p>",
  "<p>UK graduates are missing out on high-flying international jobs because fewer of them are choosing to study abroad as part of their degree.</p> <p>New research presented today by the Council for Industry and Higher Education (CIHE) found that international businesses are increasingly seeking graduates who have a global awareness, particularly those who have the initiative to study overseas as part of their learning.</p> <p>Graduates who have studied abroad tend to be more culturally aware, able to work in multicultural teams and move around the world as part of their career. But UK graduates are less competitive in the international job market as they are now less likely to study overseas than they used to.</p> <p>The report \u2013 Global Horizons and the Role of Employers \u2013 calls for better support from universities and funding bodies to help UK students gain experience of studying abroad. </p> <p>It also urges companies to offer more work placements and internships to international students and the government to establish visa and work permit regulations that allow the UK to become the preferred worldwide location for globally mobile students and businesses recruiting globally for talent.</p> <p>A survey of international graduates as part of the report, showed they think they are more likely to have higher paid jobs at more senior positions and spend less time seeking those jobs either than UK graduates or those in their home country who did not travel to the UK.</p> <p>Richard Brown, chief executive of the CIHE, said: \"The UK can be the preferred worldwide location for mobile students and global recruiters.</p> <p>\"Businesses consider that the UK develops some of the best graduates in the world. But our home-grown ones need to get that wider global perspective.\"</p> <p>\"Universities could help by developing more partnerships with overseas universities that involve more student and staff exchanges,\" he added.</p> <p>Launching the report, Keith Dugdale, director of global recruitment at KPMG, said: \"KPMG like many other UK firms recruits globally. We want the best wherever they may be.</p> <p>\"The UK develops some great talent. It attracts some of the best from around the world. We will recruit that talent but to remain competitive we want to see more UK graduates developing a global perspective through international experience.</p> <p>\"They will have to work with global clients and mix with a range of people from different cultures. They have to be at home with cultural differences.\" </p> <p>Will Archer, director of i-graduate, which undertook the survey of over 15,000 graduates, said: \"This research is a wake-up call for students and parents. You'll get further in life if you travel overseas to study or gain work experience.</p> <p>\"In today's turbulent times it is more important than ever for every graduate to demonstrate an international dimension to their thinking, and there is no better way to demonstrate this than to study or work for a period overseas.\"</p> <p>But he added that universities need to engage with former students and understand where they are in their careers.</p> <p>\"Graduates of all ages can play a vital part in providing role models and careers connections for students ... but only if their institution remains relevant and connected to them,\" he said.</p> <p>Pat Killingley, director of higher education at the British Council, which contributed to the CIHE report, said work had already started on encouraging more UK students to spend short and longer periods of study overseas.</p> <p>\"Helping our students to become more internationally mobile is a vital part of efforts to boost their career prospects and also a critical issue in our work to maintain the UK's worldwide reputation for top quality education,\" she said.</p> <p>\"[Our research] shows that employment and work experience opportunities are increasingly important to international students.</p> <p>\"We want them to think of the UK as a place where these opportunities exist and where real efforts are being made to make them more abundant.\"</p> <p>The higher education minister, David Lammy, said the report's findings confirmed the world-class status of the UK's university sector.</p> <p>He said: \"I am also pleased that international graduates know that they get good value and great jobs following their study here. But these very welcome messages must be communicated more effectively to global businesses and to students thinking of coming here to study.</p> <p>\"We must also get the message to our own students that they need to take advantage of the various schemes available to study or take work placements overseas like our very successful China summer school scheme.\"<br></p>",
  "<p>Europe's largest conference on biofuels was brought to a halt this morning when environmental activists invaded the main hall and accused the industry of destroying rainforests, evicting communities, and increasing hunger and climate change around the world. </p> <p>As six protesters from a group calling itself Action against Agrofuels climbed into the rafters of the main conference hall in Newark, Nottinghamshire, other activists at the European Biofuels Expo set off rape alarms inside the centre.</p> <p>\"It is unacceptable that the biofuels industry should hold a conference where it portrays itself as 'green',\" said John Simmons , a protester, from the roof of the Newark building.</p> <p>According to a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/jul/03/biofuels.renewableenergy\">recent World Bank report</a>, 75% of recent global food price rises are attributable to the increasing use of biofuels for transport, which have taken over tens of millions of acres of land previously used to grow food. </p> <p>\"We are incensed that this trade show has been timed to coincide with UN world food day, given that 100 million extra people are going hungry this year alone,\" said another activist. </p> <p>Richard Price, the organiser of the conference, said: \"They [the protesters] misunderstand what the event is. It's about using waste products to create energy. Most people here are using waste fuels. This is not to do with large-scale destruction of the forests.</p> <p>\"I have invited them to take part in the conference debates, but they have not yet replied.\"</p> <p>The UK government, which is one of the sponsors of the conference, is committed to substituting 10% of all transport fuels with biofuels, but a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/jul/07/biofuels.food\">major review of the target</a> earlier this year exposed deep concerns about the social and environmental impact of growing the crops. </p> <p>Yesterday the government announced a consultation into biofuels targets in the UK, but it did not include the option of scrapping them altogether. </p> <p>A new <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/oct/16/food-corporatesocialresponsibility\">report from Oxfam</a> today declared that nearly 1 billion people now go hungry around the world.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/nokia\">Nokia</a>, the world's largest mobile phone manufacturer, missed market expectations this morning as it reported a 30% fall in profits.</p> <p>The Finnish technology giant said third quarter profits fell by nearly one third to \u20ac1.09bn (\u00a3850m) from \u20ac1.56bn, with sales falling 5% to \u20ac12bn. </p> <p>The results were weaker than expected but analysts reacted positively to the group's comments on global demand for handsets this year. Nokia said it expected phone volumes to rise by 10.5% to 1.26bn phones in 2008, as sales in emerging markets offset falling demand in western Europe.</p> <p>\"With our scale, brand, improving product portfolio and low-cost structure, we believe Nokia is well positioned for the current times,\" said the company's chief executive Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo. </p> <p>Analysts expressed relief that Nokia had not delivered a gloomy outlook for next year, while noting that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/telecoms\">telecommunications</a> group had not given much guidance on market conditions for 2009.</p> <p>Thomas Langer, an analyst at West LB, said: \"The report will be taken with a bit of relief because there was not much mention of the economic crisis, but people would want to know how the company is seeing the competitive environment and the outlook for 2009. The Q3 results didn't fall off a cliff, but have put investors in limbo.\" </p> <p>Earlier this month, Nokia fought back against Apple and Google with its first touchscreen phone, the 5800 XpressMusic \u2013 a response to Apple's iPhone and the new G1 device which uses Google's Android platform. Nokia executives have described the 5800 ExpressMusic as the first in a portfolio of products targeting the music and entertainment market.</p>",

  "<p>European Union leaders agreed today to stick to ambitious plans to cut greenhouse gases by 20% by 2020, but divisions over how to share the cuts were widened by fears over the impact of the financial crisis.</p> <p>Italy's prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, threatened to veto the plan unless changes were made to lessen the burden on Italian industry. \"Our companies are in no state to take on costs like those we thought about last year,\" Berlusconi told reporters.</p> <p>And the leaders of eight eastern European countries said the EU must balance the wish for cleaner air against \"the need for sustainable economic growth\" at a time of economic uncertainty.</p> <p>Despite those concerns, the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, said all leaders had agreed to work to find a final agreement on the package before the end of the year.</p> <p>\"The crisis should not lower our ambitions,\" Sarkozy said. \"No one said that they wanted to renounce the objectives.\"</p> <p>The plan would cost governments and business billions of euros to implement new cleaner technologies, renewable energy sources, and reduce emissions from cars and factories.</p> <p>Berlusconi said that was unfair since competitors to European industry in China and the United States would not have to face such a burdens.</p> <p>Leaders of Poland, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Slovakia, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia released a joint statement on the issue, saying they had made great cuts in carbon emissions since emerging from communism in the late 1980s and that \"should be recognised\" now.</p> <p>If not, they said, eastern European nations will pay disproportionately towards an EU climate change package agreed in 2007 that calls for a slashing of greenhouse gas emissions and creating a costly emissions trading programme.</p> <p>Sarkozy, however, urged all EU nations \"bear their historic responsibility as leaders of Europe to face up to the climate challenge.\" </p> <p>He said investing in clean energy could spark economic growth. \"We can't delay, we cannot postpone,\" Sarkozy said.</p> <p>The recent financial turmoil has triggered fears of a global recession that would make governments less keen to get major polluters such as energy generators, steel makers and cement producers to pay billions into a cap-and-trade emissions scheme.</p> <p>The EU cap-and-trade programme could impose \u20ac50bn a year in polluter fees. Each of the bloc's 27 governments, including the eight eastern European countries, and the European parliament, need to approve the plan for it to become law.</p> <p>If the EU backs off, it would be seen as a harsh blow to UN climate change talks planned for December in Poland that will include delegates from more than 190 countries. </p> <p>The conference will work out the details of a climate change accord to succeed the Kyoto protocol, which expires in 2012.</p>",
  "<p>It's a big job, but someone's got to do it.</p> <p>The Financial Times is today carrying an advert for a job which might involve just a modicum of stress. Candidates must have the ability to reinvent the financial rule book overnight and, on recent experience, some weekend work will be required. Meals - well, takeway curries delivered to your desk - may be provided to cover emergency late night sessions.</p> <p>Sandwiched between an advert for a \u00a360,000 finance manager for the McLaren car engineering group and another searching for a finance chief for a company which does something not quite clear but insists it has \"an ambitious an exciting vision\" is a sober recruitment notice placed by HM Treasury.</p> <p>Chancellor Alistair Darling is inviting applications for the post of Deputy Governor of the Bank of England, and the successful candidate will be in charge of financial stability.</p> <p>And not a moment too soon. This search may conjure up images of horses and stable doors, but the perks of this lofty perch include an automatic seat on the interest-rate setting Monetary Policy Committee and another on the board of City watchdog, the Financial Services Authority.</p> <p>For those tempted, but not quite sure of the credentials of this potential employer, the advert helpfully points out that \"The Bank of England is the central bank of the United Kingdom\". Candidates, it says, \"will need the ability to develop and execute new policies in a fast-moving environment\". On recent experience, fast moving means hitting a target which can shift almost by the second.</p> <p>Successful candidates, it adds, will need to show \"strong leadership and influencing skills\" - ie the ability to order bank bosses to sit down, shut up and do what they are told, seeing as they got us into this pickle in the first place. They will also be \"of undisputed integrity and standing\" - ie investment bankers and other high-rolling City slickers need not apply.</p> <p>In the small print, the Bank naturally points out that it is committed to ensuring a \"truly diverse workforce\", thought it is not made explicit whether that extends to Icelanders.</p> <p>It is, in fact not a new job. But the previous candidate, well, came up a bit short. Sir John Gieve, a career civil servant, stepped down after what was widely-judged to be an abysmal performance in front of the Treasury Select Committee when he was summoned to explain the wreck of the Northern Rock. The communications skills demanded in the FT advert, were, shall we say, a little lacking.</p> <p>And what stipend might the bank's new deputy boss expect? A handsome \u00a3240,000 - about double the salary of the Chancellor and \u00a31,000 a week more than the Prime Minister.</p> <p>Or less than 1% of the whopping wages earned last year by some of the biggest beasts of the banking world - like Barclays' Bob Diamond - that the lucky candidate will be expected to help police.</p>",

  "<p>Is Chinese premier Wen Jiabao right to say that the credit crisis will have a negligible impact on China because its banks have limited involvement with global capital markets?</p> <p>'We are confident that we can maintain the stability of Chinese financial markets,' says Jiabao in a statement on the Chinese foreign ministry website. He adds that the biggest contribution China can make is to keep its economy growing in a stable and fast manner. Quite So.</p> <p>Assuming that the Chinese haven't been playing in the derivatives market or investing in 'toxic' US mortgage-backed securities, a systemic collapse of China's banks seems unlikely, especially as the country is sitting on hundreds of billions of dollars in foreign exchange reserves.</p> <p>But comments from the ministry of commerce, quoted in the official Xinhau news agency, should be treated with more scepticism. A spokesman says: 'many Chinese export products are daily necessities, so we don't think that a slowdown in major economies will cause a sharp fall in demand for these products.'</p> <p>Really? But western consumers have been huge buyers of Chinese finished products that include furnishings, furniture, toys, clothing and sports equipment. The truth is that Chinese industry, and employment, are going to suffer in the looming global recession as China's customers in the west rein back on spending in a way that will soon become painfully obvious.</p>",
  "<p>Some people will put a brave face on anything. The Art Newspaper's special <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/friezeartfair\">Frieze</a> edition asked: \"Chaos in the global economy - can the art market defy predictions of a downturn?\", but uber-dealer Anthony Reynolds said he could benefit from the new caution with cash. \"All the good people have still come,\" he told me, of a morning's viewing that included Charles Saatchi. \"But they're less frenetic than last year. That means they have more time to think, which is a good thing for the more thoughtful galleries.\" Reynolds has given over much of his stand to a large number of bonbons wrapped in shiny blue paper - Sturtevant's homage to F\u00e9lix Gonz\u00e1lez-Torres, which the gallerist suggests he has installed without expecting to sell. At least two couples in late middle age, who looked like they were considering flexing their Amex cards, mistook the work for a Gonzales Torres original. Admire Reynolds's mastery of the art world put-down: his is a thoughtful gallery. Which makes his rivals' spaces what?</p> <p><strong>Saatchi aside</strong>, Frieze managed to pull a small but stellar cast of celebrity visitors. Lily Allen even bought something - helped in her negotiations by Jay Jopling, who took time away from his own White Cube gallery to come to her aid. Unfortunately, he wouldn't say what it was, although the word is that it was Chinese. Sienna Miller, Emma Watson (the \u00a310m teenager who played Hermione in the Harry Potter movies), heiress model Jacquetta Wheeler, interior designer Nicky Haslam and Frieze stalwart Gwyneth Paltrow all dropped in. Gwyneth was possibly trying to forget the sad divorce of her friend Madonna, though perhaps reminded of the singer by the day's least original display: a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/sep/08/madonna.dedicates.song.pope\">signed photograph of Pope Benedict cut in half and framed by Jonathan Horowitz</a>, on show at Gavin Brown's stand. </p> <p><strong>Jefferson Hack</strong>, meanwhile, got the giggles over a Mark Quinn work entitled The Chromatic Nurseries of El Dorado - a lurid green aluminium plant involving a slightly phallic banana. In a bid to defend his artist, Jopling could only manage: \"It's OK.\"</p> <p><strong>The biggest crowd</strong> gathered around Norma Jeane's The Straight Story - three transparent soundproofed booths with extractor fans, where visitors were encouraged to drop in for a cigarette, one at a time. Mostly, the boxes were filled by men loudly proclaiming themselves to work for the construction company that had put Frieze together and therefore feeling they \"deserved a smoke more than most of the people here\". A moment of excitement came when a scouser tried to eject one of them for \"taking too long\", before Frieze attendants stepped in. Somewhere, the artist was lurking, disguised as a punter. The disclaimer forms that were thrust at people wanting to light up rather destroyed the subversive aspect of the work - though they did, perhaps, give an unwitting insight into the regulated world to come, where health and safety laws will demand that smokers and artists alike sign contracts before they're allowed to rebel.</p>",
  "<p>The Bush administration, having entered office as social conservatives, leaves office as conservative socialists, proprietors of the most sudden large expansion of the state's role in the US economy since mobilisation for the second world war. Why did they decide to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/14/us-banks-bailout-bush\">partially and quasi-nationalise America's banks</a> - to invest $250bn in preferred stock plus warrants and tell the banks that it wanted them to use the capital to expand their loan base rather than contract it via deleveraging? It is certainly not what <a href=\"http://www.ustreas.gov/organization/bios/paulson-e.html\">Henry Paulson</a> signed up as Treasury secretary to do.</p> <p>I am an economic historian. An occupational disease of being an economic historian is to insist that the answers to all questions lie in the Great Depression that started in 1929. When the financial crisis hit in a sudden squall in August 2007, in the back of the Federal Reserve's mind was that it should not repeat any of the mistakes that led to the Depression. Hence Ben Bernanke and his Fed <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/11/27/business/fed.php\">loaned extraordinarily freely</a> to banks and near-banks and non-banks in order to avoid what <a href=\"http://www.federalreserve.gov/BOARDDOCS/SPEECHES/2002/20021108/default.htm\">Milton Friedman said was the key mistake</a> that made the Depression Great: that the Fed had triggered or allowed a liquidity squeeze that made cash hard to get. Call this Plan A.</p> <p>In a couple of months it became clear that Plan A was not working. The economy was weakening. And the Fed remembered the theory - put forward by, among others, Lawrence Summers and myself - that what made the Depression Great was that businesses began to expect deflation. The expectation of falling prices made every business postpone its investment spending - better to wait a year and build your plant and equipment then when prices were cheaper - and so private investment collapsed. So Bernanke and his Fed <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;refer=home&amp;sid=aRz0DSGX_3jk\">lowered interest rates</a> to what they thought were levels that might trigger inflation, as a way of making sure that no business anywhere would even begin to suspect that a deflationary spiral was in the making. That was Plan B.</p> <p>But the economy fell toward (if not into) recession, and interest rates had already been pushed down so low that the Fed's monetary policy had lost its virtue and vigour. So it was time for Plan C: mail out a bunch of extra <a href=\"http://usgovinfo.about.com/od/incometaxandtheirs/a/rebates2008.htm\">tax-rebate cheques</a>, hoping that they would <a href=\"http://nymag.com/shopping/features/46642/\">stimulate consumer spending</a> and that once consumers began spending more the economy would recover with at worst a small recession.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the investment bank <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/bearstearns\">Bear Stearns</a> collapsed. The Federal Reserve and the Treasury concluded that they could not stand by and wait to see if Plan C was working. They had to move to Plan D: case-by-case forced mergers, liquidations and nationalisations of banks and other financial institutions in order to prevent the course of events that the third theory of the Depression said had made it Great.</p> <p>This theory was Bernanke's: that the downfall of 1929-1933 was largely the result of bank failures that collapsed businesses' ability to borrow to expand or even fund ongoing operations. So we had the forced merger of Bear Stearns into JPMorgan Chase; a lull to see if Plan C would work (it didn't); the renationalisation or deprivatisation of the mortgage lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac; that strange weekend when the Fed bought the insurance company AIG; and the bankruptcy of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/lehmanbrothers\">Lehman Brothers</a>, as Bernanke and Paulson decided that they could not rescue the creditors of every firm on Wall Street.</p> <p>They were wrong. The failure of Lehman Brothers triggered or uncovered or brought on financial catastrophe - not just in America but in Europe too, where hitherto policymakers had been watching with concern and some alarm. It was time for Plan E: the Paulson plan, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/21/business/21draftcnd.html?_r=1&amp;ref=business&amp;oref=slogin\">a $700bn programme</a> by which the Treasury would buy up troubled mortgages, mortgage-backed securities and derivatives thereof with an eye toward making sure that the banking system recovered so that it could do its job of transferring the savings of Americans to businesses that wanted to hire workers, and so keep the recession a small one and avoid the mistakes that the Bernanke theory said had made the Depression Great.</p> <p>The hope behind the Paulson plan was supply and demand. Banks and investors want yield, and so are willing to buy risky assets. If the Treasury were to buy $700bn of risky financial assets and put them on the shelf, this would diminish the supply. When supply falls, prices rise. As the prices of financial assets rose, banks would profit immensely - and people would no longer fear that the bank they were dealing with might dry up and blow away in the next week.</p> <p>The financial markets swallowed the passage of Plan E without a burp and continued on their downward spiral toward universal financial-sector bankruptcy.</p> <p>It was time for Plan F. If the prospect of buying up mortgage-backed securities did not boost asset prices and bring banks enough investment profits to create confidence that they were not all going bankrupt next month, governments could invest public money in the banks whether they liked it or not, thus making them so well-capitalised that their failure would be inconceivable.</p> <p>The American left - the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/deanbaker\">Dean Bakers</a>, the Paul Krugmans, the Doug Elmendorfs - had been calling for Plan F for a month. With the failure of Plan E's passage to move markets, monetary economists from Chicago to Berkeley to Cambridge united in their demand for Plan F. Gordon Brown and Alasdair Darling in Britain led the way, closely followed by the rest of Europe, thus forcing the hand of Paulson, who was ideologically opposed. He had not moved into 1500 Pennsylvania Avenue thinking that he would one day wake up to find himself part owner of and living in sin with a whole harem of banks addicted to the hard stuff that are derivatives built from mortgage-backed securities.</p> <p>Now we get to see whether Plan F will work, and whether this recapitalisation of the global banking system with public money will stop the slide of the world economy, and keep us in mild recession rather than severe recession or even depression. </p> <p>There is every reason to hope that it will. The liquidity-squeeze theory, the expected-deflation theory and the Bernanke banking-collapse theory were the only live theories of the Great Depression. The first two no longer seem viable. (The past year has been a big intellectual victory for Bernanke-as-academic.) So if we can counteract the chain of causation of the third - the only one left standing - we should be in no danger of even a not-so-great depression. But the theory that recapitalising the banking system will cure what ails the global economy is, at the moment, only a theory. It could be wrong.</p> <p>If Plan F fails, we move to Plan G: we pull the Keynesian fire alarm and begin an enormous government infrastructure building programme in the whole North Atlantic to keep away depression.</p> <p>But as of now there is every reason to hope that it will work - that this time, for sure, what our magicians pull out of the hat will be the desired rabbit.</p>",
  "<p>A plan to build a large, off-grid computer data centre in Scotland, powered directly by tidal energy, is set to be announced by the US investment bank Morgan Stanley. </p> <p>The scheme sidesteps one of the biggest barriers to installing renewable energy \u2014 the long wait for connection to the national grid. It also addresses the need to find low-carbon ways of powering fast-expanding and power-hungry data centres which house large arrays of servers.</p> <p>The data centre will be located in Scotland's Pentland Firth, which separates the Orkney Islands from the Scottish mainland, and has huge potential tidal energy resources. The data centre would require about 150 megawatt hours of power, equivalent to that needed to power a city the size of Bristol.</p> <p>Morgan Stanley, working with Atlantis Resources Corporation, a Singapore-based developer of tidal current turbines, proposes to install an array of tidal turbines in the Pentland Firth. They say the first series of turbines would be operational in 2011. The project's estimated cost is between \u00a3250m-\u00a3300m. </p> <p>Initially, the data centre would run on power drawn from the grid. However, once the turbines were installed, the energy would be transferred to the data centre via a private cable, also funded by Morgan Stanley,, bypassing the queue of renewable energy projects awaiting grid connection.</p> <p>\"If you bring industry to northern Scotland you overcome the electricity transmission constraints, while benefiting the environment,\" said John Woodley, co-head of Morgan Stanley's European and Asian power, gas and related businesses. \"Given that data centres need to be built somewhere, it makes sense to place them as close as possible to renewable energy sources that are currently grid-constrained.\"</p> <p>Morgan Stanley is aiming to attract customers such as Google, who have fast growing computing capacity needs. Google would not comment specifically on discussions with Morgan Stanley, but said it is actively exploring options to power its data centres with renewable energy. </p> <p>\"The data centre is the key to the tidal project,\" said Roy Kirk, area manager for the Highlands &amp; Islands Enterprise, the Scottish government's economic development agency for the region. \"The biggest barrier for any large-scale renewable energy project is grid transmission.\" </p> <p>However, Morgan Stanley and Atlantis must still secure planning permission, another hurdle for renewable energy projects. To date, no large-scale tidal energy project has made it past the concept stage in Britain, while projects a fraction the size of the Pentland Firth proposal, have taken years to come to fruition. </p> <p>\"There are a number of barriers to entry in the tidal market,\" said Gareth Zahir-Bill from Triodos Renewables.</p> <p>The specialist investment bank helped to finance the small-scale Marine Current Turbine project, which recently went live in Northern Ireland. \"That was 13 years in the process,\" he said. </p> <p>A spokesman at the Department for Energy and Climate Change said: \"Data centres are significant users of energy, they are responsible for 3% of electricity use in the UK and this is expected to double by 2020.\"</p> <p>He acknowledged that grid connection and planning issues hindered the development of renewable energy. \"The planning bill currently before parliament will streamline the consent system and our renewable energy strategy to be published in the spring will be aimed at overcoming barriers such as grid connection.\"</p> <p>Atlantis can apply for a seabed lease from January 2009. Leases will be awarded next summer. Atlantis must also receive consent from the Scottish government. Morgan Stanley will also need approval from the Highlands Council to construct the data centre and lay the private cable to transmit power from the turbines.</p> <p>But the ongoing financial crisis will not derail the plan, said Woodley: \"The longer term risks and opportunity presented by climate change and energy security remain. We will continue to seek investments that promise scale and commercial viability.\"</p>",

  "<p>Now I know we didn't come into the lobby to be churlish about colleagues from outside the lobby. (OK, so perhaps we did.) But what is all this adulation, eulogising, glorification and almost deification of our former lobby colleague Robert Peston?<br> \"Probably the most powerful British journalist I have known in my lifetime,\" gushed Stephen Glover in the Independent this week. Er, did you never meet Kelvin MacKenzie or Paul Dacre, Stephen? \"The man who moves markets,\" thundered Michael Seamark in the Daily Mail. OK, true enough. But the Mail's headline pondered: \"Does this BBC man have too much power?\" Er, no, Michael. The stellar rise of \"Pesto\", as he was known in the lobby when he was political editor of the Financial Times in the late 1990s, has indeed been meteoric. (If that's not an untidy mix of astronomical metaphors.) The \"poster boy of the financial crisis\", in the Hickey column in the Daily Express, is the latest piece of fawning by newspapers that really ought to know better. I have to report that up in Red Top Corner of the press gallery - and indeed over several chilled Sauvignons in the Press Bar - I've heard the odd mutterings of \"We taught him all he knows\", \"He didn't know what a story was until he came here\" and \"He's done all right since he left the lobby\". Indeed he has. In his days in the lobby, Pesto was a rather foppish character, so laid back he was almost horizontal. He replaced, as I recall, Philip Stephens, a very well-connected FT political editor and excellent columnist who was a hard act to follow. Unlike Phil, who always looked very intense (possibly because he spent so much time in the company of that matchstick-chewing bundle of nerves Don Macintyre, who was political editor of the Independent at the time), Pesto used to stroll up and down the press gallery corridor, known as the Burma Road, languidly and aimlessly, often looking as if he was deep in thought about anything other than what the hell he was going to write in his first edition splash. I remember seeing him doing some punditry on GMTV one morning (I obviously hadn't been to bed, because we didn't come into the lobby to get up in time to watch GMTV) and he was reclining, stretched out all over the giant GMTV sofa, crossing his long, thin legs and almost lying flat out on his back as he ran his fingers though his flowing jet-black hair. Ah yes. The Pesto locks. They were much longer in those days than today's neat trim by the BBC barber (though the sideburns haven't quite disappeared yet). I was reminded this week of how, during lobby briefings in the early Blair years, Alastair Campbell used to mimic Pesto's habit of flicking back his hair. \"Another question from the Peston school of smart-arse journalism,\" Alastair used to taunt Pesto when he didn't know the answer to one of his questions. In his Independent eulogy this week, Stephen Glover lauded Pesto as \"an old fashioned scoop-merchant\". Mmm. Ask around most members of the lobby and they'd say he didn't get as many scoops in his lobby days as he does now as business editor of the BBC. Some unkind souls with long memories have even dragged up a story Pesto wrote in the FT back in 1997 when he claimed the newly elected Blair government was contemplating joining the euro before the next general election. Nice one, Robert. But even then, to quote Seamark again, it would appear he was \"the man who moves markets\", because the FTSE apparently jumped 160 points and the pound plunged against the deutschmark. Whoops! A few days ago, speaking on behalf of the lobby before Norman Fowler's House of Lords communications committee, our revered lobby chairman, Ben Brogan of the Daily Mail, was characteristically generous about Pesto's recent triumphs. \"More power to his elbow,\" the chairman told peers. \"If he is the journalist that's led the charge on this, then good for him.\" Good God, Ben! I didn't think we came into the lobby to be magnanimous about colleagues! Incidentally, Brogan went on to describe the lobby system as \"originally quasi-masonic\" but said: \"It has opened up under [John] Major and reforms by Campbell.\" Quasi, chairman? It's not so long ago (the 1980s, actually) that secretive messages about \"red mantle\" (a lobby briefing by the leader of the opposition) and \"blue mantle\" (the leader of the Commons) were furtively passed along the Burma Road on a Thursday afternoon. It was in such a bizarre and eccentric environment that Pesto learned his trade. And look at him now! Poster boy!</p>",
  "<p>On October 16 1998, a magistrate signed a warrant for the arrest of Senator <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/pinochet\">Augusto Pinochet</a> and changed the course of history. The former Chilean head of state was arrested a few hours later, at the request of a Spanish prosecutor who charged him with a raft of international crimes, some dating back to the early 1970s. Over the next 18 months, one <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/how-the-pinochet-affair-has-unfolded-706503.html\">dramatic development</a> followed another. The House of Lords rendered three landmark judgments in the space of five months; home secretary Jack Straw defied expectations by giving a green light to the continuation of proceedings that could lead to Pinochet's removal to Madrid; Pinochet made a dramatic appearance in the dock at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/europe/9812/11/pinochet.01/\">Belmarsh magistrate's court</a>; and eventually Straw decided that Pinochet was too unhealthy to stand trial and he was <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=/archive/2000/03/02/npin02.html\">returned to Chile</a> in April 2000. For the rest of his life he was dogged by legal proceedings. </p> <p>One central question lay at the heart of the whole affair: was a former head of state entitled to claim immunity before the English courts, where it was alleged that he had participated in crimes, in violation of international conventions, such as torture? This question had never before been decided. It pitted two competing views of international relations against each other: traditionalists argued that the maintenance of serene relations between states required the courts of one state to refrain from sitting in judgment over the highest officials of another; the modernists argued that no person was above the law where the most serious international crimes were involved, and that the system of human rights laws put in place after the second world war substituted a rule of immunity with a new rule against impunity. </p> <p>In March 1999, the House of Lords came down strongly in favour of the modernist view. It did so carefully, and in a way that was both reasonable and sustainable. The majority ruled that Pinochet's loss of immunity arose not from some unstated general rule of international law, but rather from the terms of a treaty to which Britain, Chile and Spain were party \u2013 the <a href=\"http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/h_cat39.htm\">1984 convention outlawing torture</a> \u2013 the terms of which were inconsistent with immunity for a former head of state. It is impossible to overstate the significance of that ruling, which reflected a new balance of global priorities, a shift in favour of principle over pragmatism. It has been followed by international indictments against other former heads of state \u2013 Slobodan Milosevic and <a href=\"http://africa.reuters.com/top/news/usnJOE492028.html\">Charles Taylor</a> \u2013 and the coming into force of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/14/law-humanrights\">international criminal court</a> and possible proceedings against the serving president of Sudan. It has also given rise to criminal proceedings before national courts in other parts of the world. The Pinochet judgment has withstood the test of time. It has not been overruled in the court of international opinion, and it has not brought international relations to a grinding halt.</p> <p>Nevertheless, it seems that Pinochet's case caused concerns at the highest levels of the Bush administration, as described in a revealing account by a former lawyer in the Bush administration, Jack Goldsmith. He <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Terror-Presidency-Judgment-Inside-Administration/dp/0393065502/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/104-3590333-4445548?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1188910280&amp;sr=8-1\">describes how</a>, during 2002, Henry Kissinger found himself on the sharp end of the Pinochet case. Reportedly livid, a rattled Kissinger complained to his old chum Donald Rumsfeld, who was already worrying about \"lawfare\" (the use of law to achieve operational objectives). Rumsfeld instructed the chief lawyer at the Pentagon, Jim Haynes, to address the problems posed by this \"judicialisation of international politics\". Haynes passed the assignment on to Goldsmith, whose memo reached the National Security Council, which also worried about the threat of foreign judges. According to Goldsmith, the NSC couldn't work out what to do about the problem. </p> <p>We now know that while this was going on, Rumsfeld and Haynes and others at the Pentagon were secretly circumventing international laws like the Geneva conventions and the torture convention and removing international constraints on the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/16/usa-terrorism\">interrogation of detainees</a> at Guant\u00e1namo and in Iraq. Torture and other international crimes followed. So did the Abu Ghraib photos. Amid the welter of legal opinions received by the administration none, it seems, bothered to examine the consequences of the House of Lords judgment for senior US officials. </p> <p>The legacy of the arrest warrant signed in Hampstead 10 years today, is the Pinochet principle, that no one is above the law.

  "<p>Red squirrels have been discovered that have immunity to a lethal pox virus that has wiped out large numbers of the animals in England and Wales.</p> <p>The finding is being seen as a sign of hope for the native species, which has seen dramatic declines across the country since the introduction of North American grey squirrels in the 19th century.</p> <p>The majority of grey squirrels are naturally resistant to the squirrel pox virus, but carry it in their blood. Scientists believe they pass it on to red squirrels when they mark their territory with scent.</p> <p>Anthony Sainsbury, a lecturer in wild animal health at the Zoological Society of London, led a team that asked people to send in dead red squirrels for autopsy. Tests identified eight red squirrels, one in Wales and seven from different colonies in northern England, with antibodies to the virus in the tissues. This suggests they had contracted the pox but had developed a resistance to it.</p> <p>\"It's good news because we've never detected this immunity before. It means it's feasible to protect them with a vaccine,\" said Sainsbury.</p> <p>\"The idea has been mooted before, but we haven't known for sure if the red squirrel would respond to a vaccine. What we'd like to do is develop a vaccine, which we would give to them either through bait or by trapping them,\" Sainsbury said.</p> <p>The scientists are unsure whether a small population of immune squirrels has existed for a long time, or whether the virus has become less lethal, allowing some squirrels to recently build up resistance to it. The study appears in the journal <a href=\"http://www.ecohealth.net/\">EcoHealth</a>.</p> <p>The effects of the virus have been devastating on red squirrel numbers. Infected squirrels develop painful lesions on their faces and underbellies and usually die of the disease within a week.</p> <p>A recent epidemic in an isolated squirrel colony in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/24/animalwelfare\">Sefton in Lancashire</a> has wiped out 60% of the animals. Studies have shown that where grey squirrels tread, reds die out 17 to 25 times faster.</p> <p>At the end of the 19th century, red squirrels were found throughout England and Wales in their millions, but are now restricted to Scotland, small parts of Cumbria, Northumberland and Lancashire and offshore islands.</p> <p>According to ZSL there are now thought to be fewer than 140,000 red squirrels in the UK, with just 15,000 in England. </p> <p>Sainsbury said: \"Immunity to the squirrelpox virus should give red squirrels a fighting chance against the grey invaders, without which red squirrels would undoubtedly be destined to lose the battle for survival in the UK.\" </p> <p>Currently, the only way to control the disease is to cull grey squirrels.</p>",
  "<p>New York City has just completed its second year of a controversial system of school report cards that grades schools from A to F, a model the education secretary Ed Balls seems eager to adopt. </p> <p>New York's mayor, Michael Bloomberg, has executive power over the city's schools and introduced the reports in 2006 to give parents, teachers and pupils more information about school performance, and more choice.</p> <p>It introduced a clear ranking system, so that each school is compared with city rivals drawing their student populations from similar socio-economic backgrounds.</p> <p>\"It's a no-excuses system - and it is as much about diagnosing where a school needs to improve as simply evaluating it,\" said Jim Liebman, chief accountability officer of the New York City department of education.</p> <p>Information on test results has always been available, school by school, in New York.<br>And this was augmented under the Bush administration by the federal No Child Left Behind policy, which assesses schools based on test results.</p> <p>But New York City's new school report system gives a much starker lettered grade - though based on a broad range of measurements - that officials say filled a gap in available public data.</p> <p>\"The system did not replace anything. It met a need for schools and parents to have clearer information about exactly how well schools were serving their communities - there was a hole we were trying to fill,\" said an education department spokesman, Andrew Jacob.</p> <p>The report cards are called School Progress Reports - which highlights a new emphasis on schools not just performing well, but constantly improving - and they are handed out to all the city's roughly 1,300 publicly-funded elementary schools, middle schools and high schools.</p> <p>The grade a school is awarded is based on scores in three main categories: student progress accounts for 55% of the total, student performance 30% and school environment 15%.</p> <p>\"Student progress\" records how much pupils have improved over the year in test scores, \"performance\" notes how well they did in tests and exams per se, and \"environment\" takes into account attendance and annual surveys of teachers, pupils and parents.</p> <p>New York City began piloting the scheme from the autumn of 2006, building up the number of schools it assessed, until it produced the first set of school reports last November.</p> <p>Elementary and middle schools - serving pupils up until the age of 13 - have just been given their report cards and the city's high schools are about to be awarded their 2007-2008 grades.</p> <p>After the first year, schools just their letter grade. But that was criticised as unhelpful, so this year grades for the three sub-categories are given, to show how the overall letter was arrived at.</p> <p>More weighting has also been given to the levels of special needs in schools.<br>\"We responded to feedback,\" said Jacob.</p> <p>Two-thirds of a school's overall score is weighted by comparing its results with those of 40 \"peer schools\" that have been serving very similar student populations over the past three years.</p> <p>There has been a much transatlantic cooperation between UK education officials and New York's mayor, along with his schools chancellor Joel Klein.</p> <p>Three years ago, New York adopted the British style of assessment by external school inspectors.</p> <p>And UK experts have been watching the introduction of New York's report card system for the past two years, with the idea of importing it if it seemed to work. Several delegations visited New York during the pilot.</p> <p>\"Progress Reports are giving parents and the public clearer information than they've ever had before about the strengths of their schools. They have also become a tool schools use to pinpoint the specific areas where they need to improve,\" said Klein.</p> <p>New York experts drew from frameworks in schools in Florida and Texas, but ultimately designed a unique model for the city.</p> <p>At the end of the first year of the New York system, 2006-2007, the grades broke down as follows:<br>A: 279 schools (23%)<br>B: 461 schools (38%)<br>C: 312 schools (25%)<br>D: 99 schools (8%)<br>F: 50 schools (4%)</p> <p>Of the 1,000 schools that have just received their 2007-2008 reports, 58% had moved up by at least one letter grade, or received an A for the second year in a row.</p> <p>\"If a school receives an F for two years in a row, we replace the head. If it does not progress after four years, we close the school,\" said Liebman.</p> <p>He said the education department consulted teachers' unions throughout, to minimise conflict.</p> <p>However, the unions have complained that the system is still too starkly test-orientated.</p> <p>And some school heads allege that they have been marked down for not making enough progress, even though they consistently have high scores.</p> <p>\"But it is difficult for schools to make excuses when they are being compared closely with their peer group,\" said Liebman.</p> <p>He said the new system cost only around $1m a year to administer, and led to improved targeting of funding based on the results.</p> <p>The grade does not directly determine the school's next budget, but extra funding has been provided for struggling schools and bonus payments have been awarded to schools showing exceptional progress.</p>",
  "<p>While around 98% of the clocks in Britain were set to Greenwich mean time by 1855, it was not made the law until 25 years later.</p> <p>A single time zone setting the baseline for the rest of the world was first proposed in 1876 when the engineer and inventor Sandford Fleming called for a global 24-hour clock. </p> <p>While this was not immediately put into action, he continued to agitate in this direction and eventually the theory of a universal day beginning at Greenwich midnight, but not interfering with local or standard time where appropriate, was agreed upon by the International Meridian Conference.</p> <p>By the 1930s most countries had adopted hourly time zones, but in some instances these differed within regions because of geography, distance or politics.</p> <p>This remains the case today, with a number of countries carrying different time zones between states. These include India, Afghanistan, Iran, Venezuela, Burma and parts of Australia.</p> <p>Some countries including China use a single time zone despite spanning more than 15 degrees of longitude.</p> <p>France used Greenwich mean time but switched to central European time during the German occupation in the second world war and has remained that way ever since.</p> <p>Russia has 11 time zones, including Kaliningrad on the Baltic Sea. The US has 10. Canada has six; Australia nine.</p> <p>In the UK, Tory MPs have long campaigned for Scotland to have a different time zone from England to make more use of daylight south of the border. The proposal has been supported by farmers and road safety experts but fiercely opposed within Scotland itself.</p> <p>The most recent UK opinion poll on the subject showed 54% in favour of the move to central European time, with 59% in support in southern England but only 40% in Scotland.</p>",
  "<p>Jersey residents have voted against replacing Greenwich mean time (GMT) with central European time (CET).</p> <p>Nearly three-quarters (72%) of 24,000 residents on the Channel island who took part in the time zone referendum voted against adopting the European model, the results showed today.</p> <p>The States of Jersey government will make the final decision as the referendum is not binding.</p> <p>Business leaders had argued that moving the clocks forward one hour would damage Jersey's economy by putting the island out of step with London. Jersey Finance Limited said it would mean longer hours in the office for workers and 70% of its members said they were against any change.</p> <p>The vote for CET was lead by Senator Jimmy Perchard, who said an extra hour of daylight would benefit the health of residents, the environment and tourism.</p> <p>Jersey, the largest of the Channel Islands, is closer to France than to Britain, lying 14 miles from Normandy and 100 miles from Dorset.</p>",

  "<p>Holiday group <strong>TUI Travel</strong> is among the biggest fallers so far this morning, as the market continues to slide on growing fears of a prolonged global recession.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/tuitravel\">TUI's shares</a> had been buoyed by takeover hopes, following the sale by its parent TUI AG of its shipping business for \u20ac4.45bn (\u00a33.5bn). The disposal prompted suggestions, not least from TUI AG itself, that it might mop up the 49% in TUI Travel it does not already own.</p> <p>Today those hopes have been dashed. TUI AG has just said it has no current intention to make an offer for the rest of TUI Travel. This blocks it from bidding within six months unless it gets board agreement, or TUI Travel receives a competing bid. The upshot is a 13% drop in TUI Travel shares to 216.75p.</p> <p>With the Dow Jones Industrial Average down nearly 8% on recession fears, and the Nikkei 2225 off more than 11% overnight, the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> was only going to be heading one way. And so it has proved, with the index now down 143.8 points at 3935.8 having fallen as low as 3840.6.</p> <p>Miners are again under pressure, after <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/oct/15/mining-riotinto\">yesterday's comments from Rio Tinto suggesting the Chinese economic powerhouse was running out of steam</a>.
