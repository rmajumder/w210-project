  "<p>It is raining. That's an under-statement: it's raining cats and dogs and I haven't got an umbrella. So I walk into the swanky giant offices of leading London law firm Slaughter and May drenched to the skin, looking every inch nothing like the \"sort\" they're used to. </p> <p>I am shown up to a meeting room with a decimal number and told to help <br>myself to some amazing looking cakes. Presently, Katie Wilcock, 25, enters the room looking every inch like someone who would never forget an umbrella. She pities me, I can tell, but is patient and offers me her time and expertise. She puts me at ease by telling me that many clients mistakenly walk into the huge deceptive water feature in the foyer instead of up the stairs and frequently enter meetings with wet feet, but I only feel marginally better. </p> <p>Essex-born Wilcock has worked for Slaughter and May since March 2007 when she joined on a two-year training contract. She graduated from Nottingham Law School in 2006 after completing a history degree at London's Royal Holloway University. Not knowing for sure whether she was ready for a career in law, she did what many prospective law students do and did a vacation scheme (a paid work experience stint) at London firm Covington &amp; Burling.</p> <p>She applied to Slaughter and May before starting in Nottingham. \"I really wanted to be at the cutting edge of deals, not the number-crunching end,\" she says, \"and Slaughter and May is in the magic circle and has a great reputation but it's also smaller and less unwieldy than others.\" </p> <p>The firm takes on around 90 trainees each year and, says Wilcock, it's <br>been more friendly than she ever imagined. \"Slaughter and May does <br>give the impression of being a bit stiff but all of that has been dispelled.\" </p> <p>Most weeks the graduates have some sort of training, whether it's a whole day, an evening session or lunchtime stint. \"Last week, for example,\" she says, \"I had a day course on client care. We are regulated on how we treat our clients in terms of confidentiality and conflicts of interests.\" </p> <p>At the end of her two years, Wilcock will be a qualified as a solicitor and <br>Slaughter and May associate. Having done placements in property, financing, corporate and, currently, litigation, she will decide which department she graduates into. \"I've enjoyed all of my seats so I should have a vague idea,\" she laughs, \"But I still can't decide.\" </p> <p>The possibilities for Slaughter and May trainees are heady. Wilcock has just come back from a six-month secondment to a company in New Zealand, part of a \"best-friend\" scheme with selected global firms. \" I might even stay there,\" she says, \"I loved it.\" </p> <p>The variety clearly appeals to Wilcock: \"You come in one day thinking you'll be doing one thing and suddenly it will go on the back-burner. You definitely have to be that sort of person.\" </p> <p>It's clear that Wilcock is well suited to the profession. She speaks in a <br>measured and careful way, repeating my words back to me to make sure she has understood (or to make me feel foolish, I can't decide). For obvious reasons she can't talk about her favourite cases but by way of example she will offer: \" In financing I helped with a transaction involving innovative fund raising by a large international charity. The transaction comprised a variety of cross-border work and more specific English law matters. The board was made up of a number of interesting individuals and we were constantly dealing with people around the world, which was fascinating.\" </p> <p>As I leave, having finally shed some of the morning's water, Wilcock says <br>gently, \"Why don't you pop into Boots and get yourself an umbrella?\"</p> <h2>Breaking the law</h2> <p>Competition for law training placements is stiff; applications should be <br>made at least two years in advance.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.slaughterandmay.com \">Slaughter and May</a> </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.allenovery.com\">Allen &amp; Overy</a><br> <br><a href=\"http://www.freshfields.com \">Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer </a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.cliffordchance.com\">Clifford Chance </a></p>",
  "<p>The American bank Morgan Stanley faces a critical weekend as it awaits a crucial $9bn investment from Japan's Mitsubishi bank to fend off a crisis of confidence among investors which is threatening its survival.</p> <p>The 73-year-old firm has been battling persistent rumours about its financial condition in a market smarting from the collapse of rival Wall Street banks Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns.</p> <p>Shareholders dumped stock in their droves yesterday after becoming alarmed by a warning that ratings agency Moody's is considering downgrading Morgan Stanley's creditworthiness. The bank's shares plunged by 22% in New York, taking their total week-long fall to 60%. </p> <p>In a deal agreed last month, Mitsubishi pledged to pay $9bn (\u00a35.2bn) for a 21% stake in Morgan Stanley, bolstering the firm's balance sheet. The transaction is due to close on Tuesday but the recent plunge in Morgan Stanley's shares has taken the market capitalisation of the bank down to $10.7bn.</p> <p>Morgan Stanley and Mitsubishi insisted yesterday that the capital injection was going ahead. But there is concern that the Japanese bank may seek to renegotiate terms, possibly by demanding a bigger slice of Morgan Stanley given the potentially perilous impact on confidence in the US bank if it walks away.</p> <p>Morgan Stanley insiders have blamed short-sellers for aggravating the rout in its shares. One source said \"bank\" had simply become a \"four-letter word\" to the markets, irrespective of the underlying logic.</p> <p>But to Morgan Stanley's fury, the ratings agency Moody's provided fuel for doubters by warning that it may downgrade the bank's credit score - a move which would make it harder to raise funds.</p> <p>Moody's cited an expectation that \"an expected downturn in global capital market activity will reduce Morgan Stanley's revenue and profit potential in 2009, and perhaps beyond this period\". </p> <p>Morgan Stanley employs 48,000 people at 600 offices in 35 countries. It received a qualified vote of confidence from analyst Richard Bove of Ladenburg Thalmann, who cut profit estimates but said Morgan Stanley remained highly viable. </p> <p>\"This firm, if left to run its businesses, is likely to produce continuous profits, even though at much reduced rates,\" said Bove. </p> <p>Goldman Sachs also saw its stock drop by 12% yesterday. Anxiety levels in the markets were ratcheted up after credit derivatives linked to the failed US investment bank Lehman Brothers, with a face value estimated at $200bn (\u00a3118bn) to $440bn, began to be unwound. </p> <p>Many banks are involved in the credit derivatives market and are exposed to the Lehman default. They include RBS and Barclays, which could be forced to make further writedowns if they fail to recover all their money.</p> <p>Financial firms sold credit default swaps - a form of insurance against a company defaulting on its debt - to investors in Lehman's bonds and those betting on the bank's creditworthiness. These companies will now be forced to pay out 91.4 cents in the dollar. The figure is more than market expectations for losses on underlying Lehman bonds.</p> <p>Banks around the world are hoarding cash partly in preparation for the settlement of these credit derivatives linked to a wave of big corporate defaults and lower than expected recovery levels.</p>",
  "<p>A crisis meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors from the west's seven leading economies last night agreed to take \"urgent and exceptional action\" to bail out banks amid fears that a fresh wave of panic had pushed the global financial system to the brink of collapse.</p> <p>The G7 agreed to take \"all necessary steps\" including adopting Britain's plans to part-nationalise banks in order to kick- start lending in frozen credit markets after Wall Street suffered the worst week in its history. With shares, oil and sterling all plunging at the end of a dramatic week, the G7 pledged to take decisive action and use all tools available to prevent more big western banks going bust.</p> <p>The G7 issued a five-point plan in a short communique after meeting in Washington yesterday. It pledged to \"ensure that our banks and other financial intermediaries, as needed, can raise capital from public as well as private sources in sufficient amounts to re-establish confidence and permit them to continue lending to households and businesses\".</p> <p>Facing the most severe stockmarket crash since 1929, Henry Paulson, the US treasury secretary, said last night the US would use some of the $700bn, earmarked by Congress to buy up Wall Street's \"toxic waste\", to buy stakes in US banks. </p> <p>He said the government programme to purchase stock in private US financial firms will be open to a broad array of institutions, including banks, in an effort to help them raise money.</p> <p>Paulson said the G7 finance ministers \"finalised an aggressive action plan to address the turmoil in the global financial markets\", and that they were focused on the need to stabilise the financial markets. He said it had never been more important to find \"collective solutions\". </p> <p>The G7 was galvanised into action yesterday by a nerve-shredding month on the financial markets. Yesterday alone, the FTSE closed down 8.9%, slipping below the 4,000 mark for the first time in five years. It fell 381.74 points, to 3,932.06, a 21% fall over the week, wiping \u00a3250bn off the value of Britain's companies in the City's worst week since the crash of 1987. </p> <p>Across Europe, every major market saw at least a fifth wiped off its value during the week. The Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 700 points at the opening bell, but later rallied to finish 128 points down on 8,451. The Dow has fallen by 18.1% this week. </p> <p>Shares in UK banks RBS and HBOS were among the worst hit, with RBS falling 25% and HBOS 19%. The government may be forced to take a stake of up to 50% in RBS after its market capitalisation was reduced to \u00a312bn last night.</p> <p>With little sign that country-by-country plans have helped to kick-start lending, the G7 believes immediate action is vital to avoid a major slump. The past four weeks have seen the biggest cut in growth forecasts in living memory, and the IMF has warned that the world economy is \"on the cusp\" of recession. </p> <p>The chancellor, Alistair Darling, said: \"If international cooperation is to mean anything, it means governments have to move on from simply agreeing a general approach, and doing something to resolve the problems we are facing today.\"</p> <p>The chancellor hinted that the government would exact a price from UK bank chiefs deemed at fault for creating the crisis. He said taxpayers \"won't accept people taking large risks that have had hugely damaging effects, not just on individual institutions, but on the wider economic system. Agreements will be negotiated.\"</p> <p>Foreign exchange markets were also hit by panic. Sterling at one point slumped to $1.68, a five-year low against the dollar. Meanwhile, Gordon Brown dispatched a Treasury officials and lawyers to Reykjavik in an effort to reclaim some of the \u00a31bn from British savers under threat from the collapse of Icelandic banks. </p> <p>More details of the Treasury's rescue plan were revealed yesterday, with the recognition that if it fails, wholesale nationalisation of Britain's banking system is the only alternative. The government will buy shares in banks at market prices, and place them in an arms-length fund. When the immediate crisis is over, the Treasury hopes to offload the shares to investors.</p> <h2>The five-point plan</h2> <p>\u00b7 Pledge to save key banks from collapse</p> <p>\u00b7 Action to free-up credit and money markets by providing ample amounts of liquidity from central banks</p> <p>\u00b7 Support for the part-nationalisation of banks and other institutions by the taxpayer purchase of shares</p> <p>\u00b7 Stronger deposit protection schemes to reassure savers their money is safe</p> <p>\u00b7 Force banks to disclose the true state of their losses</p>",
  "<p>It was one of dozens of advertisements in the Chinese Business Gazette, a freesheet circulated in Chinatown in London. A brothel was advertising for staff: \"Located in outer London. Catered only for westerners. Busy. Comfort-able living environment. Safety guaranteed. Recruiting Misses. Housekeeper urgently required. Female only.\" Hsiao-Hung Pai, a reporter who has carried out undercover investigations for the Guardian in the past, applied for the housekeeper job.</p> <p>Summoned to a neat, featureless block of flats in leafy Bedfordshire, she was hired on the spot by Linda, an illegal immigrant using an assumed English name, who turns an annual profit of \u00a3250,000 running two brothels employing teenage girls trafficked from China. Hsiao-Hung's duties were to cook, clean and look after the girls.</p> <p>She soon realised the \"misses\" came and went on a weekly basis, rotated through Chinese-run brothels in a routine intended to keep the customers happy and the authorities guessing. It's part of a well-established system. Young girls are lured to the UK with the promise of lucrative, respectable careers. Some as young as 11, they arrive without passports or visas, some claiming asylum at British airports, having paid traffickers thousands of pounds for their transit. Once here, they vanish from the hostels or foster care to which they have been assigned by the immigration authorities, often ending up in brothels run from suburban flats and houses.</p> <p>Hsiao-Hung - posing as Xiao Yun, just in from Zhejiang province, in south-eastern China - saw for herself that the misses are never allowed out and have no idea where they are, the time of day or even the month. Few can speak English or know anything about their rights, the UK's asylum processes or its legal system; they are made to believe they have no alternative but to remain in the brothels until they have earned enough to buy their release, and their only contact with British society is the men with whom they have sex.</p> <p>Madam Linda's phone rings. \"It's Big Cunt,\" she says - she has such a nickname for all her clients. She arrived from Beijing four years back and worked as a prostitute until she'd amassed enough money to climb up the pecking order and become a lao ban niang, a madam. She switches into a sweet English voice: \"We've got a nice young girl, cup 32, very pretty, lots of demand.\" She is talking about Miss Rong, an exhausted-looking Chinese girl dressed in a lacy pink negligee, sitting on the sofa behind her, who was trafficked to Britain 18 months ago and who won't divulge her age.</p> <p>Trade is brisk today. Yet none of the other residents of Avon Court, a 70s block of flats on Shakespeare Road, Bedford, seems to suspect what's going on in this two-bedroom, ground-floor flat. Dozens of Chinese girls pass through here, part of a network that has sprawled out across almost every British town and city. It is a criminal enterprise that blurs the boundaries between trafficking and smuggling, ensnaring girls and women who in many cases leave China of their own free will. Often sent with the best wishes of their community, which has clubbed together to pay the exorbitant fees, the victims cannot bear to tell their families what they have been compelled to do on arrival. None would consider turning witness against their controllers: their heads are filled with horror stories of how they will be raped and imprisoned by the British police, and what would happen to those back home. Girls who attempt to run away are often hunted down, abducted from local authority care or hospitals. Frequently, victims emerge only when, injured, sick or pregnant, they have been abandoned on a street corner.</p> <p>It is evident there are incredible profits to be made. Last year, police discovered \u00a393m transferred back to China via one bank account held by a Chinese restaurant in Kent - money suspected to have been earned through trafficking and brothel-keeping. Recently, two specialist national police units have been created to define, penetrate and disrupt the trade. Home Office minister Vernon Coaker, who is leading the government's new anti-trafficking initiative, told us, \"Just five years back I would not have believed this kind of thing could be happening in Britain. But it is down your street, in your lane, run by communities into which we have made few meaningful inroads.\"</p> <p>\"Hurry up, cow cunt,\" Madam Linda shrieks at her new housekeeper. The doorbell rings and an overweight, married white man in his 50s saunters in. Two minutes later, \"Little Dick\" arrives. Then a third: an Asian mini-cab driver so new he has no pet name. They sit, sullenly, each waiting their turn with Miss Rong. When they have left, and Madam Linda has gone to check on her misses in another rented flat, on Station Road, Miss Rong tells us her story.</p> <p>She was once a waitress in a Chinese town she doesn't wish to name. She was earning less than \u00a350 a month and living with her parents when local traffickers persuaded her she would make her fortune in London. On her arrival, Miss Rong was taken to a brothel in Ealing where she had sex with seven clients on the first day. \"You clench your teeth and endure the pain,\" she says. After a few weeks, \"Alan\", the brothel's Hong Kong boss, passed her on to a pimp with an apartment overlooking Baker Street in London, trading as China Red. When Miss Rong was found to have syphilis, she was thrown out. Without papers, she could not go to a GP for medication. There was no going back home until the debt was paid and no words to describe to her conservative parents the reality of life abroad.</p> <p>Sick and penniless, Miss Rong sought out another brothel, this time on a council estate in Seven Sisters, north London, known as the Red Tower. Last summer, she was working in a Birmingham-based business advertising \"student-like young girls\" and \"female servants\". By the time she was taken on by Madam Linda at Avon Court - on duty from 7am to 2am, seven days a week, dosed with antibiotics bought by Madam Linda to counter the syphilis - she estimates she'd had sex with more than 7,000 men. \"I must earn as fast as I can,\" Miss Rong says, adding that she's paid \u00a320 for each 20-minute session. \"I must get through it all and get back home.\"</p> <p>After Hsiao-Hung Pai had been at the brothel for three days, Madam Linda told her to start giving customers massages. Soon after, Hsiao-Hung left.</p> <p>Five foot nothing and wearing a white T-shirt, Lingshan Lin, 15, and her 11-year-old sister Lingran disappeared on September 28 2006 from a social services hostel in Hove, East Sussex, where they were staying pending their asylum hearing. On August 24 2007, Li Juan He, 16, ran away from a hostel in Worthing, West Sussex. Xi Wang, 16, disappeared from the same hostel two months later, on October 7 2007. Jing Jing Lu, 16, vanished from a hostel in Sevenoaks, Kent, on December 15 2007.</p> <p>All had entered the UK just days before their disappearance; the only evidence they had ever been here is the photographs taken of them by police, immigration officials or social services. The authorities fear they may have been dragged into the brothel network which, our findings suggest, has more than 4,000 Chinese teenagers and young adults in its grip. Police and social services know from missing person reports that more than 1,000 have disappeared, almost all of whom have been trafficked through or were born in the Chinese province of Fujian.</p> <p>Which is puzzling, as Fujian is one of the wealthiest provinces in the People's Republic, highly industrialised and pumping out goods for the west. There are opportunities galore. And when you meet Fujianese people on their home turf, they talk only of success. We are invited to a dinner in an upscale restaurant in Fuzhou, the booming provincial capital, and our fellow guests are brimming with confidence. We ask Ai Hwa Lin - a friend of a friend, who owns two dress shops and a new \u00a3150,000 condominium overlooking the Min river - why people, especially teenagers, risk all to leave here. \"No one leaves any more,\" she says. \"We have everything we need.\"</p> <p>But when her husband, Gao Xin, pipes up for the first time, an hour into the banquet, he speaks in English, with a New Jersey drawl: \"Welcome to China, where life's real good.\" As Ai Hwa glowers, an indiscreet relative chimes in: \"Gao Xin has been away for 17 years.\" He was working illegally as a chef in a Fujianese restaurant in New York state and returned three weeks ago - the first time he'd been home.</p> <p>Ai Hwa reluctantly admits that we are last-minute additions to her husband's homecoming dinner and that he is the source of their wealth. We now notice how wan and fragile he seems, as if he almost worked himself to death. He is a stranger among family and friends. But after many toasts of Sedrin beer, it emerges that everyone around the table has recently paid for someone to travel abroad illegally, raising sums as large as \u00a320,000 for their illicit passage. Expectations are high, but there is no clear idea of what the relatives will do on arrival. Despite the weekly phone calls, the emails and photographs of which everyone here talks, no one really knows what is being endured by their loved ones abroad.</p> <p>A man in a golf shirt ambles over and introduces himself as Officer Zheng Xian, head of the city police's economic crimes division, whose responsibilities include countering trafficking. He is one of Ai Hwa's oldest friends and asks if we have heard her sister's story. He says her parents paid criminals to smuggle her to Britain in 1997; she had an excruciating six-month journey via Russia, the Ukraine, the Czech Republic and Holland, and ended up earning slave wages in British garment and poultry factories.</p> <p>Everyone has been touched by smuggling, but no one has mentioned the missing. We bring out a sheaf of reports from the UK, including ones about Fujianese girls as young as 11 who might have been swallowed up by the sex trade. \"They're just working,\" one woman mutters as she rises and leaves. </p> <p>\"You'll never find their families,\" says Xian, pointing out that Fujian has a population of almost 40 million: the names we have are so common, it would be like looking for a Jane Smith in London. In less than five minutes, everyone has gone except Ai Hwa and her ailing husband, who snaps out of his dream world. \"'What was it all for?\" he asks of no one in particular. \"I lost my life. Nobody should go.\"</p> <p>Fujian province has had a criminal tradition since the 70s, when gangs smuggling luxury goods from Taiwan began transporting people, too. They first smuggled them to the UK in the 90s, mostly to work in restaurant kitchens for the long-established Hong Kong Chinese community. It was only when 58 Fujianese men and women were found broiled in the back of a lorry transporting tomatoes through Dover in June 2000 that the province became known in Britain as a haven for snakehead gangs who could evade whatever obstacles our immigration services threw up. Four years later, 23 paperless Fujianese workers who earned pennies picking cockles in Morecambe Bay were drowned. And alongside the illegal workers and gangmasters who made the headlines, a hidden parallel trade was emerging - in girls recruited into the nascent Chinese brothel network creeping across the UK.</p> <p>But no one in Fuzhou will talk details: names, methods, routes. Some clearly fear reprisals, while to others it is commercially sensitive information.</p> <p>We drive out to villages from which the missing girls told immigration officials they came. All are dominated by new churches as large as ocean liners. We call in on one, the True Jesus Church, and ask the pastor, Chen Jin Yun, if she will help us find families whose children have gone missing in Britain. She laughs. \"Many have got children working in the UK. They love it there, but keeping in contact is always a struggle.\"</p> <p>She introduces us to duck farmer Mr Liang. All three of his brothers have gone to the UK, he says. We ask about methods, money, how they're doing. Liang sidesteps most of the questions: \"Oh, one of them is a millionaire. Everyone who goes from here to there, young or old, does very well.\"</p> <p>Liang's neighbours crowd into the room and confirm they all have children in the UK, some as young as 13. We decide against bringing out the reports of the missing. Don't they discourage their children from going so far away from home now that there are plenty of opportunities in Fujian, we ask, mentioning the hundreds of garment factories lining every highway. Liang jumps in: \"Those are menial jobs for outsiders,\" he says - Fujianese people have higher expectations than the wages offered by these factories, \u00a325 for an 84-hour week. Heads around him nod. We later check with the factory bosses and they confirm that tens of thousands of their employees are young women from impoverished and predominantly agricultural provinces such as Anhui, Hubei and Henan, 1,000 miles from here, whose residents cannot afford to be so picky.</p> <p>Later, Liang shows us the vast concrete skeleton of a building rising beside his duck pond: \"My new home. Paid for by my brothers.\"</p> <p>Villages such as Xi Zai in Fujian province have emptied to the UK, leaving behind a dwindling population of the very young and very old. The Chinese government has recently said it will crack down on trafficking, establishing special police units to do so. Liang's cousin, it turns out, is a detective in the Jinfeng police force. We get out the reports to show her. She doesn't want to know, though three of her siblings are in the UK. \"You should speak to the Chinese embassy in London,\" she snaps.</p> <p>We leave, but our Chinese researcher returns a few days later. Liang, the duck farmer, is delighted to see her. He feels more relaxed among Chinese people, he says, asking what she does. \"I'm a student, from a poor family,\" she says. \"Why don't you marry someone rich?\" he suggests. \"Or go to London?\" He offers to assist: \"If your family can raise \u00a315,000, my cousin will get you over.\" Our researcher adds a level of difficulty. \"I have a young cousin, too, 12, who would like to come along.\" Liang shrugs. \"Great. Don't worry. We send plenty of kids. It's 100% safe.\"</p> <p>Eventually, he explains how it works. His cousin is just one of a hundred people offering similar services. All can procure forged passports redesignating the travellers as Japanese or South Korean citizens, nationalities that raise fewer suspicions with immigration officials in Britain. Our researcher would be first flown or driven to Russia, where Chinese people require no visa. Then they might fly on directly to the UK, probably avoiding Heathrow. \"Few bother with trucks and boats any more,\" Liang says. Another preferred option is flying to a European city, then on to the UK with easyJet, the Madrid-London route being a current favourite.</p> <p>Our researcher will be given a UK sim card to hide in her luggage, and a phone number to write on her bra strap. She is to activate her phone and make the call on landing, and meet a Fujianese contact. \"Hang around the airport before going through immigration,\" Liang says, \"so they have no idea which flight you came in on, otherwise they could send you back. Then go to immigration and say you're a teenage asylum seeker. They have to let you in, and Britain will allow you to stay until you are 18.\"</p> <p>\"When can I go?\" our researcher asks. </p> <p>\"The next trip will be in November. We need sufficient passengers to make it worth our while. Eight or nine on a flight.\"</p> <p>Few of the British authorities tackling trafficking have been given the freedom to travel across China, observing for themselves the suffering and upheaval that result from the human trade. Relationships between British detectives and China's ministry of public security are in their infancy, with the first conference between Fujianese officials and their opposite numbers in the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) taking place in the UK this autumn. The traffickers have had a 15-year head start - the British authorities having spent nearly that long arguing over data and definitions. The first warning that Chinese children were being abused came in 1995 when dozens began arriving, unaccompanied, at Gatwick airport, claiming asylum, but the signs were ignored by everyone except the social workers called to deal with them.</p> <p>What those sending the children to Britain appeared to have hit upon, as the duck farmer Liang explained, was the specifics of British law, and in particular the breadth of the 1989 Children Act, whereby foreign teenagers travelling alone who claimed asylum had to be allowed into the country and cared for by a local authority as a \"child in need\" until they were 18.</p> <p>Sussex social workers had so many demands on them, they fought to find funding for a young asylum seekers team. The team's trafficking caseworker was Lynne Chitty, whose house in Portsmouth is filled with a jumble of files, photographs and incident reports relating to missing Chinese girls. She tells us, \"We would get the call, go up to the airport and find these kids in a holding room. They all had little bits of rolled-up paper with UK numbers on them and were desperate to make a call. Within hours of us taking them into care, they had vanished.\"</p> <p>From the brief interviews Chitty managed to conduct, she became convinced that all had been trafficked and many were ending up in brothels or worse. \"No one wanted to hear or was overly concerned about the kids going missing. The only calls I got were from the Met police in London saying they had fished the body of an Asian child out of the river and asking if it was one of mine. And I had to say: 'I have no idea.'\" </p> <p>It did not take long for the traffickers to evolve new methods. Instead of arriving with a telephone number, the children began presenting addresses and names of relatives in the UK, hoping to bypass the local authority's hostels. In 2000, Chitty took a call from one immigration official who, reviewing case files, discovered that his Gatwick team had released more than 100 Chinese children to the same \"uncle\". Unable to interest the police, Chitty eventually traced the man to a north London Chinese takeaway. The intelligence she gleaned went nowhere. Immigration officials conducted no inquiry. The phone numbers were never followed up and Chitty continued to see children vanishing.</p> <p>By 2003, people trafficking was such a global problem that the UN produced a protocol, defining it as a trade that subjugated more than 2.4 million people a year. It called for a unified response, but in western Europe only Denmark, France and Spain signed up at the time. It was not until early 2006 that the British government signed, and established Soca, which made targeting traffickers one of its priorities.</p> <p>Often it is only those spat out by the network who can testify to its existence and many of them find that life on the outside can be just as harsh. Jodie Bourke is a former children's adviser with the Refugee Council who has assisted 30 teenagers suspected of being trafficked to the UK. She told us: \"One heavily pregnant 17-year-old Chinese girl was brought to our attention when she walked into a London hospital. They didn't want to deal with her. Who was going to pay? It was only after prolonged discussions that the local authority agreed to look after her and we got to sit down and hear how she had been abducted 18 months earlier from her village in south-western China and driven to Russia, where she'd been locked in a hotel room for months and repeatedly raped. Then she was trafficked to the UK and so it went on.\"</p> <p>Victims rarely receive any compassion, says Lucy Kralj of the Helen Bamber Foundation, a London-based human rights organisation which works with trafficked women and children. \"Most of those we get to see entered the country as children and emerge from the brothels as adults, only to be consigned to Yarl's Wood immigration removal centre, in Bedfordshire, pending deportation. They are delivered to us for counselling by Group 4 Securicor in caged vans, often surrounded by their own vomit. Recently, two Chinese girls, who had escaped prostitution, were so weak they had to be carried up our stairs by security guards, who then stood behind them throughout the counselling sessions, sealing the exits.\"</p> <p>Having seen Chinese women who were so young when they were taken into prostitution that they don't even know the basics of biology, who feel as if \"a viper is eating away inside them\", Kralj says her job has become \"believing the unimaginable\". But in the UK, it appears, many in government, social services, immigration and the police are acting as if they have trouble believing at all.</p> <p>\u2022 Additional reporting: Hsiao-Hung Pai</p>",
  "<p>The character that Sarah Silverman plays on stage and television - also called Sarah Silverman - is girlish, sincere and eager to please, but also narcissistic, bigoted and, in Silverman's words, \"kind of an asshole\".

Take the Aids crisis: \"If we can put a man on the moon,\" Silverman deadpans, as if embarking on a well-worn platitude, \"we can put a man with Aids on the moon. And someday, we can put everyone with Aids on the moon.\" She speaks earnestly, inviting you to empathise with the difficulties of being a good liberal in this day and age: \"I want to get an abortion, but my boyfriend and I are having trouble conceiving.\" </p> <p>It is several years now since the US release of Jesus Is Magic, the concert film that made Silverman's name, but its jokes have lost none of their power to startle, forcing an audience to compute what she just said, whether she's allowed to say it - and whether they're allowed to laugh. \"Everybody blames the Jews for killing Christ, and then the Jews try to pass it off on the Romans,\" she says, shrugging her broad shoulders to imply that everyone's entitled to their opinion. Then, suddenly serious: \"I'm one of the few people that believes it was the blacks.\"</p> <p>The real Sarah Silverman, who is 37, lives in a big, bright apartment off Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles with her dog, a chihuahua-pug mix named Duck - \"A stoned decision I'm stuck with.\" She recently split from her boyfriend of five years, the TV host Jimmy Kimmel (although not, so far as we know, for the reasons you might infer from the song she performed on his show a few months back, I'm Fucking Matt Damon, which went on to win an Emmy). Journalists, especially male ones, often feel obliged to describe her beauty as \"unconventional\", which as Silverman notes is usually just self-flattery on the journalist's part: \"They think they're the only ones. It's like, 'You know what? I think she's attractive!' Like I'm a freaky choice or something.\" Her rising stardom has graced her with a personal assistant, a 23-year-old named James, whom she enjoys pretending to treat as a butler, snapping her fingers imperiously, though she still seems to be acclimatising to the kind of lifestyle that involves a personal assistant. \"Last week, I was trying so hard to find things for him to do,\" she says when he steps outside, \"I had to send him out to buy batteries and tennis balls.\"</p> <p>Some interesting cross-cultural chemistry seems guaranteed later this month, when Silverman arrives in Britain for her first solo performances here: a country that prides itself on its appreciation of irony, playing host to the comedian who tests its outer limits more than any currently working. Silverman doesn't plan on changing her act, which frequently mixes politically edgy stand-up with songs full of toilet humour. \"I'm sheltered, so I don't know what to expect,\" she says, \"but it's weird when British comics come over here and their whole act is about 'I'm different from you, I'm from another country!' I'm just, like, whatever. Just tell jokes. I find you not as adorable as you think you are.\"</p> <p>When we meet, Silverman is absorbed in a different project: a short video (now available online) that aims to garner votes for Barack Obama in Florida by persuading her young, Jewish, Democrat-supporting fans to lobby their elderly Floridian Jewish relatives, an especially difficult demographic for Obama. The video rehashes a vintage Silverman skit in which she explains why, far from being at odds with each other, young black American men and elderly Jews should embrace their commonalities. \"They may seem totally different, but on paper they're the same,\" she says, sitting on a sofa in her apartment between a Young Black Man and an Elderly Jewish Woman. \"I mean, think about it. Tracksuits - let's start there... Car of choice, the Cadillac. They're both crazy about their grandkids... They both say 'yo' all the time, though Jews go right to left, 'oy'. What else? Oh: all of their friends are dying.\" It's a typically brain-twisting Silverman exercise, playing with the spectres of racism and antisemitism, in a video funded by the Jewish Council for Education and Research in support of an African-American candidate.</p> <p>Silverman's humour has been well characterised, in the online magazine Slate, as \"meta-bigotry\" - the same approach adopted by the creators of South Park and by Sacha Baron Cohen on a good day. As a stand-up and in her TV show, the Sarah Silverman Program, she parodies the ways that we - bigots and self-styled liberal non-bigots alike - discuss taboo topics, or avoid discussing them, or tie ourselves in logical knots in order to hold what we think are the correct opinions about them. This is edgy in the truest sense of the term, but Silverman's blank-faced persona, of course, doesn't think she's being edgy except at those moments when she really isn't. \"Nazis are a-holes, and I'll be the first to admit it, because I'm edgy,\" she says in Jesus Is Magic. \"But they're cute when they're little - I will give them that.\"</p> <p>The biggest risk involved in being a meta-bigot is that people will think you're secretly a real bigot, wrapping your hatred in a protective blanket of irony. Some people do think this about Silverman. But the criticism that seems to have stung the most came from the New York Times writer AO Scott, who called her act \"the latest evidence that mocking political correctness has become a form of political correctness in its own right. She depends on the assumption that only someone secure in his or her own lack of racism would dare to make, or to laugh at, a racist joke, the telling of which thus becomes a way of making fun simultaneously of racism and of racial hypersensitivity... Naughty as she may seem, she's playing safe.\" (\"That was something that always festered in the back of my mind that I never talked about,\" Silverman has said.)</p> <p>But a good Silverman routine should still make her typical audience - white, liberal - feel uncomfortable, not least because of the way her glib homilies seem to echo those to which we're prone, even though their content is the precise opposite. A typical one-liner begins as if it's a pro-diversity clich\u00e9, then swerves sharply in another direction: \"I learned that whether you're gay, bisexual - it doesn't matter,\" she says brightly, cocking her head. \"Because at the end of the day... they're both gross.\"</p> <p>Silverman was born and raised in New Hampshire, the youngest of four sisters, in a family that by virtue of being Jewish and liberal was almost unique. \"It was a very conservative area,\" she recalls. \"Very white-blonde, very preppy, hoity-toity. Ever since I was little, people would ask, 'Are you from New York?' and I'd say, 'I'm from here!' I felt like a stranger in a strange land.\" She was \"hairy and dark\", and used humour at school to deflect insults about her \"monkey legs\". But she attributes her earliest performative leanings to her father, Donald, who owned a clothes shop called Crazy Sophie's Factory Outlet, for which he recorded his own local radio ads. (\"Spend your time at the mall - spend your money at Crazy Sophie's!\") When she was three, he taught her to say \"bitchbastarddamnshit\". \"He thought it was hilarious,\" she says. \"I would say them for his friends, and all these adults would go crazy laughing. And they were laughing at pure shock value - a tiny child saying filthy words. It became very addictive for me. I chased that excellent feeling, even from that age.\"</p> <p>Before she was born, her parents had had a son, who died in an accident while in the care of her grandmother; they told Sarah about him when she turned five. \"Every Sunday my grandmother would pick us up in the car and we'd go to a diner for lunch,\" Silverman remembers. \"The Sunday just after I'd learned about Jeffrey, we got in the car, and she goes, 'Everybody put your seatbelt on!' And I go, 'Yeah... because we don't want to wind up like Jeffrey!'</p> <p>\"I thought that would kill,\" she recalls, shaking her head. \"I remember bursting with excitement to say it. And she just started sobbing. God, my poor Nana. But up until then I had learned that saying the worst possible thing was funny, you know?\"</p> <p>Her parents divorced when she was six. \"It was the happiest day of my life. I remember my sisters crying and saying, 'She doesn't understand.' I was sad, too, but I was sad because I'd learned a dance, and nobody was watching. I remember thinking, 'I don't understand? They're moving away from each other! I couldn't be happier.' Every single night was screaming. I look back on it even now, and I totally got it. I was happy.\" By her early teens, though, she had become deeply depressed, and a chronic bedwetter. (She was dispatched to see a local psychiatrist. At their first appointment, he prescribed Xanax; when she arrived for her second appointment, it turned out that he'd hanged himself.) The cloud lifted only after she arrived in New York, aged 18. \"I remember describing my depression to my stepdad, and saying, 'I feel like I'm homesick, but I'm home.' And then I arrived in New York, and I swear, the day I moved there, it felt like I was home. I felt like I was a bear who'd been raised in the, in the...\" She trails off. \"I don't know. I don't know where bears aren't raised. But you see what I mean.\"</p> <p>Silverman didn't last long at New York University: she was spending every evening handing out flyers for comedy clubs in exchange for time on stage, and would often fall asleep during lectures; she soon quit to pursue comedy full-time. In footage of her early shows, she can be seen mocking the clich\u00e9s of live stand-up - \"I like having sex! Are there any sex people here tonight?\" - and exploring the humorous potential of her Jewishness: \"My sister's getting married, and they're taking each other's names, so she'll be Susan Silverman-Abramowitz. But they're thinking of shortening it to just 'Jews'.\" </p> <p>By 22, she'd been hired as a writer on Saturday Night Live, any trainee American comedian's dream job. She was fired almost immediately. SNL at the time wasn't welcoming to women, nor to comedians with a distinctive voice who couldn't write for a variety of characters. Besides, one imagines NBC executives blanching at some of Silverman's jokes, such as this line, about a law requiring women seeking an abortion to wait 24 hours to consider their decision: \"I think it's a good law. I was going to get an abortion the other day. I totally wanted an abortion, and it turns out I was just thirsty.\"</p> <p>Then, in 2001, after various small roles in film and TV, she made an appearance on Conan O'Brien's late-night talkshow that has since become notorious. During the interview, Silverman recounted being summoned for jury service and wanting to find a way to get out of it. \"So my friend said, why don't you write something really racist on the form, like, 'I hate chinks'? Yeah, but you know, I don't want people to think I'm racist - I just want to get out of jury duty. So I filled out the form and I wrote\" - at this point she beamed, smugly - \" 'I love chinks.'\" As O'Brien buried his head in his hands, Silverman added: \"And who doesn't?\"</p> <p>This joke is, of course, not racist, but about racism: the humour is in Silverman's apparent belief that changing the word \"hate\" to \"love\" acquits her of bigotry. Still, one could argue that \"chinks\" is an easier word for Silverman to use than for people of Chinese heritage to have to hear, and it provoked a furious attack from Guy Aoki, the president of a lobby group called Media Action Network for Asian-Americans. The resultant furore culminated in a disastrous joint appearance by Silverman and Aoki on the talkshow Politically Incorrect, in which Silverman tried to defend the joke before losing her cool and calling Aoki a \"douchebag\".</p> <p>She says the experience taught her never to try to defend her humour. \"It's so subjective, comedy,\" she says now. \"If you don't find something funny, it can easily be truly offensive, so I usually just say I'm really sorry.\" (Notably, she declined to apologise for another infamous appearance, in the 2005 documentary film The Aristocrats, in which her comic turn ends by straightfacedly accusing a real, much-loved American TV personality of rape.) In her stand-up act, she says that the \"chinks\" affair taught her another lesson: she learned that racism is bad. \"And I mean bad, like in that black way.\"</p> <p>Silverman's humour, which works so well when her topic is the way in which we discuss relations between social groups, only really fails when her targets are individuals: then, it can seem cruel. \"Wow, she's amazing,\" Silverman said of Britney Spears at the 2007 MTV Music Video Awards at which the troubled singer tried to stage a comeback. \"I mean, she's 25 years old and she's already accomplished everything she's going to accomplish in her life. It's mind-blowing.\" At another MTV event, days before Paris Hilton was due to go to jail, Silverman drew loud cackles from the audience with a lewd joke at her expense. Hilton, who was in the audience, looked frozen and mortified; unexpectedly, you found yourself feeling sorry for her.</p> <p>Silverman seems uninterested in exploring what it means to be a woman in an overwhelmingly male-dominated business. Early last year, when the journalist Christopher Hitchens wrote an article in Vanity Fair entitled Why Women Aren't Funny, Silverman was endlessly pestered to write a rebuttal. In fact, the Hitchens article didn't live up to its title - it merely speculated about why men more often use humour to attract women than vice versa - and Silverman didn't disagree with it. \"Snore,\" she says today, when the topic arises. \"That article was just saying that in general, men who are not necessarily attractive, as a survival skill, use humour to get girls. And for women it is not that way. There are other things you do to get men that are very superficial, very materialistic - and that says more about men than it does about women. The reason there are lots of funny women is because of other survival skills they've had to develop, whether because they're fat or they're hairy or they've had a rough life, and they have to create this shell of a sense of humour in order to survive through it.\"</p> <p>Make no mistake: Sarah Silverman does not want any of your labels. \"People are always introducing me as 'Sarah Silverman, Jewish comedian,'\" she says at one point during her stage act. \"I hate that! I wish people would see me for who I really am. I'm white!\"</p> <p>\u2022 Sarah Silverman appears at the Hammersmith Apollo in London on October 19. Series 1 of The Sarah Silverman Program will be screened on Paramount Comedy 1 from October 20-24. Jesus Is Magic is out on DVD on October 13.</p>",
  "<p>Like most television naturals, Kevin McCloud has an unmediated quality which comes across as effortless - even artless. He arrives for lunch fresh from a building site, with the Grand Designs production team in tow, and talks to me more or less as if I were one of their cameras. As he folds his six foot plus frame into a seat, shakes off his high visibility jacket and orders a drink, perfectly formed sentences purr out of him like a voiceover.</p> <p>\"Every good piece of contextual one-off architecture is unique, so it's bound to modify,\" he says, explaining why so few of the projects featured on the Channel 4 programme go entirely to plan. \"Building a house from scratch in the middle of a field is a bit like building a prototype car. As with all prototypes, if you're building a car you usually have the luxury of producing several prototypes before you arrive at the production line version - so the opportunity for changing things is quite rich. But with a one-off house it's almost impossible to make all your changes before you begin to build. Half way through, you suddenly realise something's got to change.\"</p> <p>It's classic McCloud commentary - conversational, providing context, delivered almost like a private confidence. His great gift, of course, is for talking to the camera as if it were his lunch companion. A kind of David Attenborough of the building site, Channel 4 executives must have been unable to believe their luck when they found him. </p> <p>Back in 1998, when reality television had yet to be invented and the only makeover show troubling the schedules was Changing Rooms, McCloud was a professional lighting designer and author of two books on interior decoration. A production company approached him with an idea for a show about people designing and building their own houses from scratch. McCloud wasn't even sure it would work. </p> <p>\"When we first started, we got a bit slagged off by the television press for being a bit too nice; not critical or confrontational enough. But we were there to celebrate something. The whole premise isn't adversarial or exploitative, but celebratory,\" he says.</p> <p>Unlike most reality formats, the personal dramas of the people whose houses it features are not the point of the programme. \"I'm not interested in filming people just because they've got 18 children or something. What has to be interesting, ultimately, is understanding a building through people.\" </p> <p>Never the other way around? </p> <p>\"Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Not at all. It is about buildings.\" </p> <p>Eight series in, Grand Designs is Channel 4's second highest rated show, while McCloud is that rarest of television phenomena - an entertainment presenter who inspires almost universal admiration. He is often described as the respectable face of reality television, if such a thing is possible, and presents one of the few property programmes whose defining premise has not been undermined by the housing crash. Grand Designs is only interested in a building's design, not how much it might sell for. Though he has no architectural training, last year McCloud was made an honorary fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects, and tonight he will present the Stirling prize - architecture's equivalent of the Booker or the Turner - for the fourth consecutive year. </p> <p>Among this year's finalists is a city academy, one of the new schools whose investment in the belief that good design can dictate behaviour - and happiness - reflects McCloud's own faith. This summer, Channel 4 broadcast a series about community regeneration through architecture in Castleford, Yorkshire, a five-year project he oversaw and presented. </p> <p>\"It wasn't just a piece of television. For once it changed the way people think, or made them more demanding.\" Channel 4 has issued the series on DVD and sent it to every local authority and regeneration agency in the country, but the greatest lesson of Castleford for McCloud, he says firmly, was that \"quality in the public realm does not come from committees\". What does he mean? \"You cannot use the democratic process for the procurement of excellence. You do the very uncomfortable thing of finding individuals, local champions.\"</p> <p>At 50, he lives with his wife and four children in an \"idyllic\", 16th-century home in Somerset, full of elaborate eco-innovations such as a \u00a375,000 biomass woodchip boiler. When he isn't riding his fold-up bicycle, he's driving his Saab fuelled by locally produced bioethanol, or the Land Rover he's converted to run on vegetable oil. It would be surprising if McCloud didn't sometimes seem a little bit self-satisfied - and in truth, every now and then he does. (He can almost always tell, he says, if a building project will go to plan or not: \"How many professionals have you got? Project manager? Yeah. Architect's still involved? Yeah? Great, then it's going to work. Oh - you're throwing your architect away. Oh I see, and you're project managing it yourself. Not good,\" he says, shaking his head witheringly. \"Not good.\") The surprise, though, despite all the charm and authority, is how sensitive - even defensive - he can be.</p> <p>The first time it flares is when I mention the charge of elitism occasionally levelled at the show. \"Well I don't know. Is there a charge of elitism?\" he retorts coolly, even haughtily - and completely disingenuously. Come off it, I say. </p> <p>\"The people who attach the elitist charge are usually middle-class journalists who are sensitive to the possible view that it is remote and inaccessible and that because people can't afford it, it's elitist. All I'll say to you is if you look at the demographic of our audience - and indeed I can say anecdotally meeting people - is that ... actually I'll tell you a story, we were on the Park Hill estate in Sheffield, not the most ... well, we'd just had bottles thrown at us from a balcony as we were walking with the cameras, filming. And then round the corner come three heavies, these three enormous blokes with lots and lots of piercing and tattoos, big guys in black, and I thought, 'This is it, we're dead, they're going to beat us up, knock my teeth out, knick the camera, steal all our money, we're gone.' And the bloke said to me, 'Ehhh, you're that bloke off Grand Designs aren't you.' The he said, 'Fantastic!'</p> <p>\"You know I meet a huge number of people from social-housing projects from all kinds of backgrounds, and not once has anybody ever said to me, 'Yeah, well they're all too bloody rich aren't they, I'll never be able to afford that.' Because it's not about the money. It's about dreams, and connection to other people's dreams. And people connect to it. And actually, it completely cuts across barriers. So I'm incredibly relaxed about that, although an extraordinary number of people I meet who are, you know, [he adopts a slightly prissy voice] concerned about the welfare and accessibility of things to people of all backgrounds, they seem to be very wound up about Grand Designs being elitist. But in my experience it's anything but. In fact it's the opposite.\"</p> <p>For a question he began by pretending not to recognise, that's a pretty long answer. But when he talks about his mission to popularise good design, he has put his money where his mouth is. </p> <p>Building on the success of Castleford, he wanted to film a \"kind of community Grand Designs,\" building a whole community from scratch. </p> <p>They found a small scheme in Cornwall, and began filming - but then it fell through. </p> <p>\"I went to see [Channel 4] and we sat down in a room and everybody put their head in their hand, and said what are we going to do. What are we going to do? And I just said, well I'll do it. Literally, it was just in the heat of the moment. I said well, you know, I'll become a developer - I'll raise the money, and do it.\"</p> <p>McCloud set up a development company called Hab, which stands for Happiness Architecture Beauty, he found partners, and has bought land just outside Swindon, Wiltshire. By now he has sunk \"a lot\" of his own money into the project, which will be a micro eco-town of about 200 houses, and he says he always knew he'd be an \"easy target\". But he was still stung by the schadenfreude of press coverage this summer, when Hab parted company with its architects. Under headlines such as \"McCloud's grand design at risk of becoming grand disaster\", critics accused him of being \"too idealistic\" and \"commercially naive\".</p> <p>\"I described that press coverage as scurrilous and rancid,\" McCloud fires back. \"It was full of a great deal of misrepresentation.\" </p> <p>The credit crunch has absolutely not, he insists, scuppered the project. The planning application will be submitted in about a month's time, and he gets boyishly excited listing all the innovative features - such as the sensors in each house which tell you when the next bus is coming, the edible green spaces, the residents' intranet. Half of these feature, he volunteers cheerfully, will fail. \"And that's OK.\" But I suspect he'd do almost anything to make sure the project doesn't.</p> <p>When I ask if he has bad or trashy taste in any aspects of his life, for a moment I fear he's so protective of his image that he's giving one of those phoney, self-aggrandising answers. </p> <p>\"I'm not too fond of really cool design. I've got quite kitsch taste really, in things like tableware. I'm quite a sucker for 1930s pressed glass.\" </p> <p>Don't you have to be cool to even know what 1930s pressed glass looks like, I wonder? But then he elaborates - and, winningly, it turns out not to be cool at all. \"You know, the stuff my granny used to have. And I have a morbid attraction to 1960s prints like Blue Lady, stuff that used to decorate my parents house. I've got a soft spot for Constable reproductions. Bit of Constable, bit of Turner, bit of Blue Lady. Yeah,\" he says, with a grin, \"I can go for that.\"</p> <p>\u2022 The RIBA Stirling Prize is on Channel 4 this evening at 8pm</p>",
  "<p><strong>What inspired you to start playing the piano?</strong></p> <p>My mother was a very fine classical pianist and teacher. My older brother was a pianist.

  "<p><strong>The Great Crash: How the Stock Market Crash of 1929 Plunged the World into Depression</strong><br>by Selwyn Parker<br>310pp, Piatkus, \u00a312.99</p> <p><strong>The Ascent of Money: A Financial History of the World</strong><br>by Niall Ferguson<br>397pp, Allen Lane, \u00a325</p> <p><strong>The Gods that Failed: How Blind Faith in Markets Has Cost Us Our Future</strong><br>by Larry Elliott and Dan Atkinson<br>326pp, The Bodley Head, \u00a312.99</p> <p>In rising financial markets, the world is forever new. The bull or optimist has no eyes for past or present, but only for the future, where streams of revenue play in his imagination. In falling markets, there is nothing that has not happened before. The bear or pessimist sees only the past, which imprisons the wretched financial soul in eternal circles of boom and bust and boom again. </p> <p>Bulls don't read. Bears read financial history. As markets fall to bits, the bears dust off the Dutch tulip mania of 1637, the Banque Royale of 1719-20, the railway speculation of the 1840s, the great crash of 1929. Leering phantoms emerge from the historical dark, like the parade of ghostly Scottish kings in Macbeth: John Law, Clarence Hatry, Jesse Livermore, Charles E Mitchell, Robert C Merton and Myron S Scholes. The bears trace in Alan Greenspan the indulgence of Andrew Mellon, and descry in George W Bush the weakness of Herbert Hoover. </p> <p>As John Merriwether, the banker who brought Long-Term Capital Management to grief in 1998, said: \"If I had lived through the depression, I would have been in a better position to understand events.\" Or, as Niall Ferguson writes, \"The average career of a Wall Street CEO is just over 25 years, which means that first-hand memories at the top of the US banking system do not extend back beyond 1983. That fact alone provides a powerful justification for the study of financial history.\"</p> <p>Cause and effect, the riddle of all history, is a particular devil in financial history; and never more so than today, where entire classes of security are collapsing not on public exchanges and stock-tickers but because there are no markets to establish prices this side of nothing. In the most straightforward of these books, Selwyn Parker goes for a causality of dominoes and billiard balls, as in this magnificent passage on the progress of the great depression in his native New Zealand: </p> <p>'This was a nation that lived off the sheep's back and the cows' udders. Entire country towns depended for their prosperity on profits from big grazing estates and dairy farms. As overseas earnings declined in the general blockade of trade, men were being laid off meat-slaughtering lines in giant meat freezing works. Woollen mills slowed to half-pace. Ships started to leave the ports half-empty. State-owned railways freighted less and less cargo. Dairy factories processed less milk. Sales at the nationwide farmers' cooperatives - retailers suppling everything from grass seed and weedkillers to bush shirts and gumboots - rapidly collapsed. Country pubs dispensed less beer and city brewers laid off staff.'</p> <p>Ferguson, a Scots professor at Harvard more attuned to philosophical fashion, invokes chaos theory to explain how the prospect of default on self-cert mortgages to African-Americans on Detroit's West Outer Drive causes a bank run in Newcastle upon Tyne. \"The subprime butterfly had flapped its wings and triggered a global hurricane.\" This is a sort of dehumanised version of Burke: \"A common soldier, a child, a girl at the door of an inn, have changed the face of fortune, and almost of Nature.\" For Larry Elliott and Dan Atkinson, economics editors of this newspaper and the Mail on Sunday respectively, financial history is the unfolding of moral law of a popular or commonsense character. Their Gods that Failed are not just the City and Wall Street and various other citizens that annoy them but, in a smart rhetorical manouevre, certain copy-book moral failings: speculation, recklessness, greed, arrogance, oligarchy and excess. </p> <p>Parker's book is a good account of the Wall Street crash of 1929 and the resulting worldwide depression as banks failed, credit contracted, tariff barriers were erected and the volume of world trade fell by two-thirds. His narrative takes us to out of the way places somewhat ignored in the standard accounts of those events, most notably JK Galbraith's The Great Crash: 1929 (1955). Here are not just New Zealand and Australia, but Newfoundland, Sweden, the Netherlands, Hawaii, Bengal, Scotland. Unfortunately, what we really rather badly need to know this week is not the price of jute in Calcutta in 1931 but the precise chain of events that caused 10,000 bank failures in the US between 1929 and 1933 (much better in Ferguson) and the success or not of the depression-era precursor of the Paulson plan, the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. Parker was not to know that. </p> <p>Ferguson's reputation is so high that if he were a stock one would short him. The very title of his book, The Ascent of Money, is a screaming sell signal, like the shoe-shine boys trading stock tips at the door to Grand Central Station in New York in 1929. In fairness, Ferguson recognises that and his pages are hot with proof-stage tyre-marks, as he goes into violent reverse to escape from under collapsing arguments. None the less, his book is very readable indeed and the television series for which it is a sort of trailer, will, I am sure, be even better. </p> <p>Ferguson believes money was invented to record and discharge debts, and he passes rather quickly on to the rise of banking in the Middle Ages, the issue by governments of annuities and other bonds, the origins of insurance and the establishment of joint-stock companies. As with all economist-historians, Ferguson's soul is at war with itself. History tells him there is such a thing as history. Economics tells him there is none, for everything is always and ever subject to unvarying laws (which just happened not to be discovered till the other day).</p> <p>The result is that the book is not very interesting until it approaches our times. No philologer, Ferguson assumes pecunia means money in the sense that money means money. His account of the rococo Scottish financier John Law and his Banque Royale of 1719-20, based on no source older than 1969 and none in French, shows absolutely no feeling whatever for the character of his great countryman or the manners and laws of the French regency.</p> <p>Yet Ferguson really understands the Rothschilds, and the 19th century in general, and he writes a long and marvellous chapter on the growth of house ownership as a civic right and the rise of mortgage finance. It was the depression itself that created the home-owning ideology and the credit institutions to pay for it, such as the Federal National Mortgage Association or Fanny Mae (which has just had to be rescued). </p> <p>Here is Ferguson on It's a Wonderful Life (1946), the film starring James Stewart that sentimentalised mortgage finance: \"Jimmy Stewart knew both the depositors and the debtors. By contrast, in a securitised market (just like in space) no one can hear you scream - because the interest you pay on your mortgage is ultimately going to someone who has no idea you exist.\"</p> <p>His account of Long-Term Capital Management, in which academic economists thought they had understood the secret workings of markets and came spectacularly to grief, made me laugh out loud. Ferguson is by temperament and breeding a financial Stoic, to whom all financial phenomena, however repellent or terrifying, have been designed by the Comptroller of the Universe for the prosperity of the whole. It is a hard philosophy for these times. </p> <p>The Gods that Failed is raucous and very likeable. The contention of its two authors is that Britain has fallen in the past 40 years under the sway of something they call, in an echo of Swift, the \"financial interest\". The bankers and financiers, chained up after the second world war by exchange control, high and selective taxation, bank regulation and social parsimony, gradually broke their bounds. They were secretly assisted by a lurid and deep-laid conspiracy of philosophers such as Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman and, in a most interesting dialectical twist, by the breakdown of traditional authority in the social movements of 1968. </p> <p>Elliott and Atkinson sticks pins into the usual pin-cushions, from Greenspan to the Davos conference and the geniuses at LTCM. I was less clear as to precisely how the City is responsible for the closing of sub post-offices, the government's project for identity cards, city-centre CCTV, council equality officers, disruption in the National Health Service, restrictions on the smoking of tobacco in public and the general form of government the authors call \"nagocracy\". Middle Britain may well have been conned, as Elliott and Atkinson claim, but surely it is not only by the financial interest. I suppose this is is how the Guardian can drink with Mail on Sunday without coming to blows. </p> <p>Through it all is that British nostalgia for manufacturing industry. Factories, for these authors as for the Edwardians, represent national wealth of a more solid or steady kind than dealing rooms at Canary Wharf. The destruction of manufacturing is a sort of proximate cause of the credit boom that threatens to bring our nation to grief. \"An unproductive economy, asset-stripped of most of the resources that would have enabled it to pay its way in the world, was unable to provide the level of earnings to which the public and the government felt entitled. The obvious, if dangerous, answer was to borrow the difference.\" </p> <p>It is all a little overdone. Where, in this parade of cartoon financial villains, is Frank McGarahan of Barclays Wealth who gave his well-remunerated life last week to protect a homeless Lithuanian by the Guildhall in Norwich? Not all lending is predatory. It was not just the financial interest that turned my country neighbours into buy-to-let landlords. What has happened to Caveat debitor: let the borrower take care! As for Mrs Watanabe, the archetypal Asian saver, who paid for this British rural speculation, Caveat creditrix: let the lender beware! Lenders hungry for yield meet borrowers thirsting for social advancement. They combine. And detonate.</p> <p>Elliot and Atkinson demand that in return for the benefit of limited liability and the protection of courts and police, the financial interest must submit to public control. Their seven-point plan comprises balance-sheet controls, separating retail banking from securities, limits on size, licensing of derivatives, industrial \"champions\" \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise, targeted taxation of bankers and cutting red tape for non-financial companies. </p> <p>These proposals have been overtaken by events. Instead of smaller banks, the wave of forced mergers is throwing up behemoths of the extent and character of the projected Lloyds-HBOS and Citi-Wachovia. Even liberal writers have embraced nationalisation. If banks cannot be permitted to fail, then their liabilities (as Martin Wolf of the Financial Times was musing last week) were perhaps always and only ever contingent liabilities of the public. If, to continue the argument, we are every one of us on the hook for the money the bankers have borrowed, then by God or Ford we will have something to say about how they speculate with it. What is at risk is not merely our prosperity but our liberty. In his first proposal to Congress, Paulson demanded dictatorial powers. As Chris Dodd, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee put it: \"I can only conclude that it is not just our economy that is at risk but our constitution.\" </p> <p>Parker ends optimistically: \"We are smarter than we were in the 1930s,\" which you can believe or not, best not. I am certainly not smarter than my father or grandfather. Ferguson ends with a chapter, strongly influenced by Schumpeter and Darwin, which describes financial markets as evolutionary, marked as he puts it by Cambrian Expansions and Great Extinctions. It is bravura Ferguson, supremely self-confident, demotic or even pubby, and ending at a point that is the precise reverse of observable reality: \"The only species that is now close to extinction in the developed world is the state-owned bank.\" (The tyre-mark here is: \"though the nationalisation of Northern Rock suggests the species is not quite dead\".)</p> <p>For myself, I have been struck by something I read about the market for credit default swaps, a species of bond insurance that ballooned into one of the greatest speculations of all time. Here is Gerald Corrigan, a managing director of Goldman Sachs and at some-time president of the New York Federal Reserve: \"An effort has been under way since the spring to net down offsetting CDS trades thereby reducing the notational amounts of such trades outstanding. The results have been dramatic. Between April and August, the notional value of dealer and client index trade at the the Depositary Trust Company was almost cut in half from $30,000bn to about $16,000bn. As the effort extends to single-name trades, further dramatic progress is expected.\" Those trillions, that could destroy the world, net out to zero. We are in a sort of financial cold war in which instruments of immense destructive power must be negotiated out of existence. </p> <p>\u2022 James Buchan's books include Frozen Desire: The Meaning of Money.

  "<p>Mark Innocenti, a 26-year-old commercial surveyor from London, lost his job last month. He joined recruitment agencies and attended interviews but, with the construction industry completely crunched by credit and the banking crisis, found hundreds of people scrabbling for the same position. As Britain slips towards a dangerous recession, he has taken a radical decision: letting his home, selling his car and scrimping and saving to pay \u00a39,000 to take a masters degree at a university in Australia.</p> <p>Every day, stupefying sums of money are wiped from stock exchanges across the globe and taxpayers' billions are spent propping up faltering banks. Bewildered ordinary people are left worrying how this market chaos will affect them. With the transformation of the economic landscape, many feel compelled to alter their own lives in a new search for security. Tales of citydwellers stockpiling tins of beans and heading for the hills may have the whiff of urban myth, but life overshadowed by the prospect of a recession is already taking drastic or curious turns. Couples are deciding they can't afford children, downsizing to live in caravans or taking their houses off-grid; pensioners are buying safes in which to stash savings whipped out of the banks.</p> <p>Innocenti hopes his foreign degree will increase his chances of finding work in Australia, at least until the building industry recovers in the UK. Another friend in the industry has already relocated to Abu Dhabi. \"People are looking to go to Hong Kong, Singapore and Dubai,\" Innocenti says.</p> <p>Emigration specialists report a huge surge in people seeking to move overseas. Stefan Watts, a director of Study Options, which helps place people in universities in Australia and New Zealand, has found inquiries have increased by 100% in the last three months. Many are from professionals who have lost their jobs and are seeking to retrain. The Emigration Group (EG) says inquiries about moving abroad have quadrupled since the beginning of August and it is now handling 2,000 each month.</p> <p>The problem for those wanting to take the next flight out of the country is, increasingly, their house. \"The big frustration is that people can't sell their houses and realise their biggest asset,\" says Paul Arthur, a director at EG.</p> <p>Sam and David Donaldson are so desperate to emigrate they are trying a radical new way to sell their five-bedroom home in Bradwell, Essex: they have put it up for a \"reverse\" auction, which could see it sold for as little as 1p. <a href=\"http://www.humraz.com\">Humraz.com </a>is selling a restricted number of \"seats\" to participate in the online auction. Once 7,500 people have paid \u00a397 each for the right to bid up to 220 times for the Donaldsons' \u00a3515,000 home, a quick-fire online auction will result in the winner being the person who bids the lowest unique amount (the only person to bid, for instance, \u00a3906.26p). The Donaldsons' receive their house price through the sale of the auction seats. The total of \u00a3727,500 also covers VAT, stamp duty, a charitable donation and Humraz.com's 1.5%-1.7% commission.</p> <p>Asmat Monaghan set up the site with the intention of helping first-time buyers get on the property ladder. She is now inundated with homeowners - 200 a week, compared with two a week in April - unable to sell their houses and attracted by the idea of a guaranteed sale price based on official valuations.</p> <p>Sam Donaldson, an orthopaedic technician, says if all the auction seats are sold she will receive the price she would have got for her house six months ago; the winner will buy the house for far below its market value. Then, she and her husband and 10-year-old son will relocate to Perth, western Australia. </p> <p>\"I could easily find work in Australia but I'm stuck here with this house,\" she says. \"We came off our fixed-rate mortgage and are now paying a variable rate which has gone up. It's now \u00a32,700 a month. It's a lovely area but we're not enjoying the house because we resent paying that money.\"</p> <p>Hull City may be storming football's Premier League but that feelgood factor is too little too late for Paul Carmichael and his young family, who are moving to Australia in search of greater job security. Carmichael, 36, last week accepted an offer on his three-bedroom house in Hull of nearly \u00a320,000 less than its initial asking price, fearing it would only lose more value if he waited.</p> <p>For years he has helped build up a small family business making resin floors for factories but work has dried up. \"Everybody is spending less and it's now fix and make do, rather than buy new flooring,\" Carmichael says. \"You hear about manufacturing in the UK. What do we make now? It doesn't seem like there is going to be the level of security for the next 20 or 30 years until I retire that I assumed there would be.\"</p> <p>While he accepts that Australia will be suffering from elements of the same global downturn, he believes its stronger manufacturing sector benefits from the country's proximity to China. \"Australia has an expanding population and plenty of space to build new factories,\" he says. \"The way things are going I think we're getting out at the right time especially when banks are starting to collapse.\"</p> <p>Living without mains electricity, gas or water may once have been a middle-class, environmental idea. But it is increasingly motivated by more pressing financial imperatives. Nick Rosen, the author of How to Live Off-Grid, says traffic to his blog has risen by 30%-40% this month and interest has \"intensified\" owing to fear and a lack of credit. \"People are particularly interested in small houses and sheds - looking at where they are going to go if they can't pay their rent or if they get evicted. That wasn't on the agenda a month ago.\"</p> <p>Other eco-friendly habits are spreading because of economic fears. More than 60,000 UK residents are now members of car-sharing schemes such as Streetcar. It has 40,000 members and membership is growing 40% faster than earlier in the year.</p> <p>Apart from selling their cars or securing their homes, the recession-hit are also seeking more secure jobs. James Carter is one of an increasing number of former City workers retraining as teachers. A headhunter, the 29-year-old left his job this year and is now four weeks into a PGCE at the Institute of Education in London, after which he will become a secondary school science teacher. </p> <p>\"A factor in my final decision was a lack of security in the City, as well as wanting something less repetitive that would also help people more,\" he says. Looking at struggling former colleagues now, \"almost makes you think, thank goodness I got out for the right reasons and actually have a career rather than just worrying about where the next sale is coming from.\"</p> <p>The search for security is also preoccupying those lucky enough to have savings. Reports of worried savers frantically closing their bank accounts and stashing their money under mattresses may be exaggerated although research by the market and consumer research firm Mintel shows just 16% of adults trust a major high street bank brand compared with 33% last year. </p> <p>Anthony Neary, of online retailer <a href=\"http://www.thesafeshop.co.uk\">The Safe Shop</a>, reports a flurry of concerned callers this week after an expected sales increase in September: \"Every other caller is someone saying, 'I want to take my money out of the bank.' It has definitely become an issue now. People see the government's rescue package is not making a difference to share prices and so they don't trust it now.\"</p> <p>Fears over disappearing savings, falling share and property prices is creating a boom in the gold trade, as people look for what they perceive to be a safe bet. While the phones at BullionVault, an online gold broker in west London, \"lit up\" after Northern Rock collapsed last year, according to Adrian Ash, head of research, interest in the precious metal has gone through the roof in the past month. \"The interest in buying gold at the moment is just phenomenal. Yesterday we opened 1,400 new online accounts, which is three times our previous record set the week before.\"</p> <p>Frank Cochran, 50, the founder of an investment company from Wolverhampton, sold a house he owned in Portugal three months ago. Rejecting offers to invest in everything from coffee to orange juice he put his money into a gold fund instead. \"In times of trouble, the one thing people always run to is gold. We're going into a period where the UK could go into deflation and in a deflationary climate, precious metals hold their value,\" he says. \"People are starting to question the wisdom of investing in banks and building societies. Alistair Darling has said he will guarantee up to \u00a350,000 in individual savings accounts but if it all goes terribly wrong does the government stand a chance of paying it back to everyone?\"</p> <p>Worried investors are also lodging their life savings in liquid: fine wine retailers report brisk business. \"People are attracted to wine as an investment because it is a tangible asset and over the long term it almost always performs strongly,\" says Joss Fowler at wine merchant Berry Bros &amp; Rudd, where sales are up 5% on this time last year.</p> <p>When it comes to spending, people are not just cutting back on luxuries such as holidays or beauty treatments. Richard Lee, a leading cosmetic dentist in London, says many clients are not only postponing cosmetic work \"while they sort out their finances\" but also cancelling routine check-ups because of job insecurity and the fear their boss would notice they were not in the office. </p> <p>\"Over the last three or four weeks things have been a lot quieter,\" says Lee. \"People are concerned and worried and don't want to be seen to be out of the office. Talking to colleagues in London, everyone is pretty quiet at the moment.\"</p> <p>When people do dare leave their desks, there is plenty of evidence that they are eating more modestly. Sales of the humble mackerel are up by 76% in Waitrose in recent weeks, while Allinson reports sales of bread making and culinary flour have risen by more than 50% in the last month. Pubs are having to adapt: The Pigs in Edgefield, Norfolk, is running a bartering scheme whereby locals can bring in vegetables from their gardens and exchange them for pints or meals. \"If you grow, breed, shoot or steal anything that may look at home on our menu, bring it in and let's do a deal,\" says a sign at the pub. The Swan Inn in North Petherton, Somerset, has introduced a BYO food rule so customers cutting down on eating out \"can bring their own food in so they can have a drink while they eat it\", says its landlady, Julie Barnard. \"We did do food and had a full time chef but it just wasn't feasible to carry on.\"</p> <p>This pervasive insecurity and uncertainty is even reaching deep into people's personal lives. Claire Blakemore, a senior solicitor at the law firm Withers, says many divorces are in \"limbo\" because financial volatility is seeing people's asset values vary hugely each day. </p> <p>\"People can't sell or remortage their properties, so reaching a final settlement becomes more problematic. Some couples are having to stay living under the same roof because their liquid assets have been reduced and they can't afford to move out,\" she says. \"At the moment we are confronted by a lot of bankers who are fearful of committing themselves to a settlement that they think they may not be able to afford if the financial crisis continues.\"</p>",
  "<p>Late in the 19th century, a Philadelphian named Frederick W Taylor toured the smoky foundries and clattering mills of his day carrying a stopwatch and a clipboard. Taylor measured the workers' movements and routines, and then came up with schemes to deploy them more efficiently. It was the birth of \"scientific management\". Over the following decades, it extended its reach, evolving from rudimentary improvements at shipyards along the river Tyne to the clock-like precision of Toyota production lines in Derbyshire. For factory workers, labouring under the boss's gaze and stopwatch has long been part of the job.</p> <p>But Taylor's successors have had trouble moving into \"knowledge\" industries. It's far easier, after all, to count the revolutions of a lathe than the generation of ideas. This keeps the focus in office work on results, not process. Sell a house, win a trial, wow the boss with elegant lines of software code - and the particulars of how you do your job don't count against you. This is in great part because they haven't been counted.</p> <p>Until now. These days, the omnipresent office computer records and times every keystroke and mouse click. It keeps track of every web page visited. Phone logs and emails define each worker's network of connections. Companies own this avalanche of information produced on their machines by labourers in their employ. And some are starting to realise that by studying the patterns of office workers, they can glean insights about their operations and their employees. They've found their 21st-century stopwatch and clipboard. And they're counting on an elite cast of mathematicians and computer scientists - people I call the numerati - to help them automate management.</p> <p>Three years ago, at IBM's Watson Research Centre, north of New York city, a team of 40 numerati embarked on an ambitious mission, converting reams of worker data into mathematical models of 50,000 of the company's employees. Modelling was nothing new. For decades, mathematicians have been building models of the physical world, from jet wings to nuclear bombs - working with these simulations is cheaper and more efficient (not to mention safer) than creating the real thing. But only in the internet age, with employees producing rivers of data, would they dare to attempt modelling knowledge workers.</p> <p>Samer Takriti, a Syrian-born mathematician, headed the project for two years (before leaving Big Blue last year for a top maths job at Goldman Sachs). Speaking in his office at the Watson lab, Takriti admitted that it was no easy job to model humans. Unlike machines they get depressed, they feud and fall in love, they lie and drink and come up with great and transformative ideas. Perhaps most importantly though, they figure out systems designed to control them - and work to turn them to their own advantage. In other words, IBM's 50,000 consultants (who are no dummies) would probably learn to doctor their calendar items, web-surfing patterns and emails to produce the most flattering possible mathematical facsimiles of themselves.</p> <p>But even if IBM's models are subject to such manipulation, the data promises plenty of insights into workers' behaviour. Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University have found that the patterns of emails, for example, describe each worker's place in the group. They can pick out the active networkers, the brown-nosers (who send blind copies to their supervisors), and the so-called \"outliers\" - people who don't seem to be communicating with anyone. </p> <p>What's up with them? Kathleen Carley, a professor at Carnegie Mellon's School of Computer Science, says they are more likely to be unhappy, preparing to quit, or even passing on inside information to rivals.</p> <p>If employers choose to study the words contained in emails, they can learn even more. One marketing research company in Colorado, Umbria Communications, feeds millions of blog posts every day to its computers, which can instantly calculate the gender and approximate age of each blogger, as well as their opinions about a host of consumer products. </p> <p>Looking at the positive side, a similar analysis of emails in a company could line up workers with distant colleagues who have similar interests or expertise. On the downside, though, managers could easily run a battery of tests. They could calculate, for example, the productivity of the 10% of workers who most often refer to \"beer\" or \"football\" in their emails, or even those who express negative views about the company. (IBM says that it does not analyse employees' emails. But other companies do, especially in the banking industry.)</p> <p>In the short term, here's how IBM's mathematical models work. Managers assembling a team for a global assignment - for example, launching a call centre in the Far East - type in the prerequisites. The system then automatically scans thousands of workers and suggests the ideal team. These are people who appear to work well together, live near the right airports, have the right language and technical skills - and come in under budget. </p> <p>In the old days, says Takriti, managers would make calls or ask around the hallways when putting together such teams. But such a rolodex approach comes up short in a global business with 300,000 workers. Managements in giant companies increasingly need something closer resembling a search engine. To be found and managed in such a system, workers must be described as mathematical symbols.</p> <p>For consultants at the top of their profession, this automation might sound demeaning. But IBM cannot afford to treat them like one of Frederick Taylor's micro-managed welders, lest they take their valuable skills and knowhow to more human competitors. No, IBM's models must make room for happiness. Job satisfaction, in the language of engineers, is one of the system's \"constraints\". A boring assignment? Save the star the aggravation and give it to someone else. </p> <p>And yet this mathematical management won't be nearly as considerate of lower-level employees. By Takriti's reckoning, so-called commodity workers produce razor-thin profit margins. This means they must be worked as close as possible to 100% of their working hours. Clearly, by the remorseless logic of the numerati, those who do simple jobs will either be replaced by machines or treated like machines by the machines managing them.</p> <p>Once automatic systems gain control of workers' skills, routines and schedules, the next step is to break them into smaller pieces. At least that's what Pierre Haren believes. Haren, the founder of France's iLog, a logistics analysis company recently bought by IBM, predicts that workers' days will be broken down into hours, half-hours, and eventually minutes. At the same time, the jobs to be done, whether building a software program or putting together a class-action suit, will also be broken into tiny steps - much like the factory work Taylor dissected all those years ago. As the system taps their expertise, minute by minute, knowledge workers assume their positions on a global assembly line. \"This is the equivalent of the industrial revolution for white-collar workers,\" Haren says.</p> <p>This may sound like a puppet show with the numerati pulling the strings. But in the workplace Takriti describes, there's room for everyone. Indeed, even as they model their colleagues, the maths whizzes on the IBM team are producing rich data trails of their own. If IBM's automation yields the expected efficiencies, the numerati themselves one day will be described mathematically and assume their posts in the global assembly line. </p> <p>\u2022 The Numerati, by Stephen Baker, is published next month by Jonathan Cape at \u00a317.99.</p>",
  "<p>A number of your commentators and editorials have urged the \"curbing\" of City bonuses this year. What does this mean? Instead of the usual, say, \u00a310m bonus, will \u00a31m now be acceptable?</p> <p>However, none of your commentators has suggested that the City bankers, derivative traders etc should repay the bonuses they awarded themselves in previous years. Presumably the present financial catastrophe has been brewing for quite a few years, while these people have been awarding themselves enormous sums - last year the total bonuses amounted to \u00a313.7bn, I believe (Report, June 25). Surely this amounts to obtaining money under false pretences - they have pretended to be creating \"wealth\" for the nation, while actually behaving in a wholly irresponsible, incompetent and possibly criminal manner to enrich themselves alone, and undermining the real economy.</p> <p>A real Labour government would immediately pass legislation that would allow it to fine these people an amount equal to their previous bonuses. The money so obtained from assorted tax havens etc could then be used to prevent repossession of houses and create employment for those whose jobs are about to disappear in the coming recession. One year of City bonuses would bootstrap a renewable energy industry, another year of bonuses would fund the creation of a national electric car industry, and so on, creating hundreds of thousands of really useful jobs.<br><strong>Dave Hookes</strong><br>Liverpool </p> <p>You report that the government has no concrete plans as to how to rein in executive pay (Huge bonuses for City high flyers will be hard to rein in, October 10), but there is already one obvious mechanism: taxation. For decades the tax system has been crying out for reform, so that salaries, excessive bonuses and share-allocation perks are properly taxed at, say 50%. In addition, the use of tax havens must be better regulated, for example by insisting that all income earned in the UK should be fully taxed here, no matter where the mogul lives.</p> <p>I do not mind if some people earn a lot of money, so long as I can see that the country is getting a fair slice of it in tax. The problem is that both Tory and Labour administrations have manifestly failed to ensure that the system is fair.<br><strong>Dr Stephen Bax</strong><br>Canterbury Christ Church University </p> <p>We have been told for years that the UK was a centre of excellence for financial services and that huge City bonuses were the price needed to retain talent. Now we are in the middle of a financial crisis largely precipitated by the myopic greed of this grotesquely overpaid \"talent\". Today you report one fund manager claiming that \"if London becomes badly paid there will be an exodus to Mumbai\". Why is this a problem? If India wants to let these fools and knaves wreck their economy, good luck to them.<br><strong>Chris Webster</strong><br>Abergavenny, Monmouthshire </p> <p>Mervyn King has not had a good crisis. If it is time (as it surely is) for some bank directors to walk, shouldn't he lead the way? Doesn't this highlight another gap in the rescue plan? Why should the chancellor (hopefully) gain the influence to tell others to fall on their swords but leave the governor untouchable? I hope Gordon Brown now regrets making the Bank of England independent.<br><strong>Professor John MacInnes</strong><br>University of Edinburgh </p> <p>Along with a number of commentators, the Guardian seems to think that irrationality is somehow fuelling the meltdown in global markets (Report, October 10). The serious share price drops are put down to \"panic selling\", \"fear\" and a \"lack of confidence\". </p> <p>Perhaps the reason is that most people realise their shares are going to be virtually worthless in six months' time and that the companies whose shares they hold are likely to have disappeared off the map. Rather than the future being \"uncertain\", it is very likely that both market and general economic conditions will continue to deteriorate rapidly for the foreseeable future. You would be crazy not to cut and run. It is the only rational and logical thing to do.<br><strong>Tony Prince</strong><br>Leicester</p>",
  "<p>'And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves, </p> <p>\"And said unto them, It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves.\" - Matthew 21:12-13. </p> <p>Let us make no bones about it. This financial crisis is a major spiritual crisis. It is the crisis of a society that worships at the temples of consumption, and that has isolated and often abandoned millions of consumers now trapped on a treadmill of debt. It is the crisis of a society that values the capital gains of the rentier more highly than the rights of people to a home, or an education or health. It is the crisis of a society that idolises money above love, community, wellbeing and the sustainability of our planet. And it is a crisis, in my view, for faith organisations that have effectively colluded in this idolatry, by tolerating the sin of usury. </p> <p>I define usury as the exalting of money values over human and environmental values; of creating money at no cost and lending at rates of interest intended to accumulate reserves of unearned income. Of reaping that which one did not sow.</p> <p>Christians began to dilute the sin of usury as far back as the 1500s. John Eck, supported by the Fugger banking family, in his book Tractates contractu quinque de centum (1515), defended 5% as an acceptable rate of interest as long as the borrower and lender mutually agreed to the loan. Martin Luther took exception to this laxity, and raged that \"heathen were able, by the light of reason, to conclude that a usurer is a double-dyed thief and murderer. We Christians, however, hold them in such honour that we fairly worship them for the sake of their money ... Meanwhile, we hang the small thieves ... Little thieves are put in the stocks, great thieves go flaunting in gold and silk.\"</p> <p>Luther's views were regarded as fanatical and were to be firmly displaced by the teachings of John Calvin (1509-1564) whose writings altered the status of the usurer in society. Instead of arguing in effect that loans should be \"natural\" or sustainable, Calvin argued that interest is lawful, provided that it does not exceed an official maximum. </p> <p>Calvin said that when Christ said \"lend hoping for nothing in return\", that meant we should help the poor freely. He dissected two Hebrew words for usury - neshek meant \"to bite\", tarbit meant \"to take legitimate increase\" - and argued that only \"biting\" loans were forbidden. Thus one could lend at interest to business people who would make a profit using the money.</p> <p>In what was to be an epic shift, the Christian goalposts had been moved; by Eck and then Calvin. Whereas Islam remained opposed to interest and usury, elites in Christian societies were given permission to decide on a rate of interest.</p> <p>Today, unscrupulous moneychangers like the head of Lehman Brothers stand condemned by millions - robbed of their money, their pensions, their homes and their futures. Too late, the moneychangers have taken their gains and fled, leaving bankruptcy, losses and a systemic global financial crisis behind. </p> <p>\"Faced by failure of credit they have proposed only the lending of more money,\" Roosevelt said of other unscrupulous moneychangers in 1933. \"Stripped of the lure of profit by which to induce our people to follow their false leadership, they have resorted to exhortations, pleading tearfully for restored confidence. They know only the rules of a generation of self-seekers. They have no vision, and when there is no vision the people perish. The moneychangers have fled from their high seats in the temple of our civilisation. We may now restore that temple to the ancient truths. The measure of the restoration lies in the extent to which we apply social values more noble than mere monetary profit.\"</p> <p>As a first step to applying those social values, we may bring back the ancient truth that usury is a sin.</p> <p>\u2022 Ann Pettifor is a political economist.

  "<h2>Europe</h2> <p>EU governments yesterday rushed to adopt UK-style financial rescue plans, with Germany close to adopting a scheme for \u20ac150bn (\u00a3119bn) in guarantees and capital injection for its banks.</p> <p>The Spanish cabinet approved a \u20ac30bn fund, which can be raised to \u20ac50bn, to buy \"quality\" assets from banks, and it increased the deposit guarantee to \u20ac100,000. Ministers said the scheme would cost taxpayers nothing. Italy, which approved emergency legislation to recapitalise banks and inject equity on Thursday, said it would ban short selling in all stocks, not just banks and insurers, on the day after the US lifted its ban.</p> <p>Danish MPs approved a government scheme to back up all bank deposits and guarantees; and Dutch finance groups welcomed a government plan for a \u20ac20bn capital fund. France this week set up a \"state participation society\", containing - so far - \u20ac1bn capital in municipal lender Dexia; but it made no further moves yesterday, saying its banks were \"robust\".</p> <h2>Russia</h2> <p>Given Britain's grim relations with Russia, it was unlikely that Moscow would ever praise Gordon Brown. But the Kremlin is considering a Brown-style plan to ease Russia's dire banking problems. The government will set up a fund to buy \"quality\" assets from banks struggling with liquidity,with the country's central bank putting in $15bn initially.</p> <p>Russia's two leaders, meanwhile, have wasted little time in blaming the crisis on the US. President Dmitry Medvedev this week memorably accused the US administration of \"economic egoism\". Vladimir Putin, the prime minister, said: \"Confidence in the US as the leader of the free world and the free market... has been undermined - for good, I think.\"</p> <p>Russia has been keen to downplay its own economic difficulties. Although regulators suspended trading again on Russia's two main stock markets yesterday, TV news channels have been told not to use the words \"collapse\" or \"crisis\"; and there has been little mention of the flight of foreign investors from Russia.</p> <h2>India</h2> <p>The global slump hit the Indian economy hard yesterday, with the authorities slashing banks' reserve requirement after the rupee slumped to a record low and overnight lending rates doubled. The stock market dropped 800 points, to 10,527 - less than half its level in January.</p> <p>The Reserve Bank of India dropped the cash reserve ratio to 7.5% from 9%, its steepest cut since 2001, sending 600bn rupees (\u00a37.1bn) into the financial system. India's central bankers had become alarmed after overnight rates soared to as much as 23% in the money market and tighter liquidity saw the government call off a $2bn (\u00a31.16bn) bond auction.</p> <p>Annual industrial output growth was 1.3% in August, its lowest in nearly 10 years and far below a revised 7.4% expansion in July. Palaniappan Chidambaram, the finance minister, insisted the figures were \"not satisfactory... and not reliable\".</p> <h2>Japan</h2> <p>Lessons learned from Japan's so-called lost decade of recession in the 90s have been credited with sparing it from the worst of the crisis. But this week proved the country had no reason to be complacent. </p> <p>The Nikkei yesterday ended the worst week in its history with a fall of almost 10%, the biggest one-day loss since the crash of 1987. Yamato, a life insurance firm with a 98-year history, has gone under with debts of \u00a5269bn (\u00a31.55bn) - the industry's first bankruptcy for seven years.</p> <p>Despite official insistence that its economic fundamentals remain sound, all the major indicators show that the world's second-biggest economy is teetering on the brink of recession again. </p> <h2>Brazil</h2> <p>Brazil's main stock market index fell more than 10% in early trading yesterday, compounding weeks of heavy losses in which two years of gains in Latin America's biggest economy were wiped out. The Ibovespa index fell 10.2% to 33,303 in just the first half-hour after markets opened yesterday. Trading was then halted for 30 minutes by a \"circuit breaker\" that takes effect when the index loses 10%. Brazil's currency, the real, weakened to 2.3 against the dollar. </p> <h2>Venezuela</h2> <p>Venezuela is bracing for the petro-state to curb its free-spending ways after President Hugo Chavez said his socialist revolution was not immune from the global financial crisis. State bonds on international markets have dropped to their lowest levels in five years and plunging oil prices are expected to squeeze next year's budget. Consumer spending on cars and other big items has already started to shrivel.</p> <p>Chavez says he hopes the crisis will prompt other Latin American leaders to forge ahead with his cherished plan for a Bank of the South, to counter the influence of the World Bank.</p> <h2>Cuba</h2> <p>Cuba's isolation from global financial markets has largely protected it from capitalist contagion, allowing it to watch the turmoil with relative equanimity. \"It was expected,\" Fidel Castro noted in his regular column in the communist party newspaper, Granma. He did not elaborate. Cuba is facing its own crisis after a series of recent hurricanes devastated its agriculture and infrastructure. </p> <h2>Zimbabwe</h2> <p>There are economic crises - and then there is Zimbabwe's financial system. While much of the rest of the world is anxious about plunging markets, bank collapses and recession, Zimbabweans would settle for any of that just to be able to find cash and to have it worth something in the face of an official inflation rate of 231m%. Independent economists say the real inflation rate is in the trillions, but such numbers have ceased to mean anything to most Zimbabweans, who are limited to withdrawing the equivalent of a few pence a day from their bank accounts.</p> <h2>Iraq</h2> <p>The Baghdad bourse is booming, with the general index of Iraq's stock exchange up by nearly 40% last month. The floor was heaving with investors and brokers on Thursday, many glued to their phones and eager to snap up bargains on the second day of trading after a national holiday. Hotels and banks were the hottest picks among the exchange's 95 listed companies. </p> <p>But Iraq's 2009 budget depends on oil staying above $80 a barrel. Prices - above $140 in July - have fallen below $90 in recent months. </p> <h2>Middle East</h2> <p>Developers and banks were among the hardest-hit by falls in Gulf Arab markets, with governments hoping that huge budget surpluses and non-oil sector growth would sustain them through the crisis. Dubai's market was down by more than 20% in four days of trading, while the Arab world's largest, Saudi Arabia, fell by more than 17%. Among the hardest-hit in Dubai were developers and banks.</p> <p>However, only in a region where developers are announcing $100bn construction projects even as markets collapse could the crisis be seen as a potential blessing. Some analysts say the current meltdown could bring a much-needed cooling of the overheated economies in the region. Meanwhile, Opec members are zealously looking to guard prices, and recently announced a meeting for November - a month ahead of schedule.</p> <h2>Southeast Asia</h2> <p>Stock markets have plunged to their lowest levels in years, where they are open - the authorities in Jakarta kept Indonesia's stock market closed for a third day in a row. Suspected intervention by the central bank failed to prop up the rupiah, which briefly touched 10,000 to the dollar, its weakest since December 2005.</p> <p>Thai stocks fell by more than 10% to trigger a temporary trading halt, before closing down 9.6%. Bank stocks were particularly hard-hit. In Singapore, the Straits Times Index fell 7.3% to its lowest close since December 2004. Malaysian stocks were down 3.6%, and Vietnamese, 4.7%.</p> <p>\"Everybody under the sun is selling,\" said Gabriel Gan, head of sales trading at AmFraser Securities in Singapore. \"There has been a total loss of confidence. We are seeing panic selling.\"</p>",
  "<p>After decades of war, invasion and occupation, Lebanon and Israel have plenty of tension simmering between them; but the latest source of strife is literally cooking. </p> <p>From the deep-fried chick peas that make falafel to the parsley and burghul wheat of tabbouleh, the salad that's almost a national obsession - green-fingered enthusiasts once held the world record for making a dish weighing one and a half tonnes - Lebanon's foodies are pushing back against what they see as Israel's appropriation of their cuisine. </p> <p>\"At ethnic food exhibitions our producers go to the Israeli stand and find most of the specialities they are marketing as Israeli foods are Lebanese,\" said Fadi Abboud, president of the Lebanese Industrialists' Association (LIA). \"Our culture goes back a few thousand years. It's time to set the record straight.\" </p> <p>Abboud and researchers say they have documentation to prove that 25 traditional dishes hail from Lebanon and deserve the EU's Protected Designated Origin status, meaning they can be marketed under their name only if they were made in the country. Under an EU deal, Lebanon is entitled to seek European arbitration for its claim to protected status, but will require a World Trade Organisation ruling for the move to affect sales in non-EU markets.</p> <p>Thick files on each food are being drafted to make a case based on the 2002 ruling that only Greek-made cheese could be called Feta, which dealt a blow to Danish and Dutch producers. But in a region where food is as strong a source of national identity and pride as national borders, the move has caused friction. </p> <p>\"He's plain wrong. Falafel is originally Turkish,\" said Rabea Abdullah, chief falafel fryer at the famous King of Potatoes eatery in Hamra, Beirut's bustling commercial heart. \"Maybe tabbouleh can be said to be Lebanese, because everyone knows we invented it.\" </p> <p>Abboud admits that copyrighting falafel will be hard - Egyptians and Syrians also lay claim to it. Tabbouleh is probably Lebanon's best hope at exclusivity, but it's in the lucrative hummus market, worth $1bn (\u00a3590m) worldwide, according to the LIA, with 500,000 tubs eaten a day in the UK alone, that Abboud really believes he is on to a winner. </p> <p>\"We believe we can prove Lebanon commercialised hummus in the late 1950s,\" he said. \"We own the name and if Marks &amp; Spencer or Tesco want to produce hummus they will have to produce it in Lebanon. Or they'll just have to call it 'chick-pea dip'.\" </p> <p>The LIA move drew no official reaction in Israel, though some diners in Jerusalem cited shared Arab and Jewish heritage derived from Abraham to claim hummus belongs to all in the region. </p> <p>The move also has angered some Lebanese food experts, saying such dishes should be seen as originating in the Levant, the area of Syria, Lebanon, Palestine and Jordan before western intervention led to national borders and the creation of Israel in 1948. </p> <p>\"Foods like falafel are not Lebanese but they're certainly not Israeli either. How can they be when Israel is only 60 years old?\" asked Rami Zurayk, professor of agriculture and ecosystems at the American University of Beirut, and author of a book on \"slow food\" in Lebanon. </p> <p>\"But Lebanon's borders are only 60 years old as well. There is an instinctive response in the region against what is seen as Israel's theft of land and appropriation of culture, but to register falafel as Lebanese is almost as absurd and chauvinistic as Israel trying to register it as Israeli.\" </p> <p>Abboud remains adamant the case is worth pursuing, not least to address what he sees as misconceptions about Arab culture. </p> <p>\"There is a fashion that everything good coming out of the Middle East comes from Israel and everything bad from the Arabs,\" he said. \"When I lived in London people were always surprised to learn we drank Lebanese wine. But why? Do you think Jesus drank Bordeaux?\"</p>",
  "<p>General Motors insisted yesterday that bankruptcy was not an option, despite facing what it described as \"unprecedented challenges\".</p> <p>Fears have been growing that the biggest US carmakers, GM and Ford, are close to calamity as the crisis in the financial markets has bled into the real economy.</p> <p>Shares in the pair were back under pressure in early trading on Wall Street yesterday after going over the precipice on Thursday on fresh evidence of slowing car sales and a warning that the credit ratings of both companies could be cut deeper into \"junk\" territory, making it even harder for them to borrow money. GM shares crashed 31% on Thursday to close at $4.76, their lowest in almost 60 years. Ford's stock fell 21% the same day.</p> <p>The big three carmakers in the US, including Chrysler, have been losing market share for years, but a collapse of one would shatter American self-confidence.</p> <p>GM, worth $52.4bn (\u00a330bn) at its peak in 2000, has dropped below $2.7bn in market value - less than it was worth at the beginning of the Great Depression. Ford is valued at about $4.7bn.</p> <p>In a statement before the market opened, GM said: \"Clearly we face unprecedented challenges related to uncertainty in financial markets globally, and weakening economic fundamentals in many key markets. But bankruptcy protection is not an option GM is considering.\"</p> <p>Barclays Capital added to the pressure on GM yesterday when their analyst Brian Johnson cut his target on the shares to $4. GM has $21bn in the bank but is burning through $1bn a month and Johnson said the company's need for cash was increasing. Last year, GM lost $38bn.</p> <p>GM sales have fallen 17.8% in the US this year and are down 1.9% in Europe. But JD Power warned on Thursday that the picture was likely to worsen along with the broader economy. \"The global market in 2009 may experience an outright collapse,\" the firm said. </p> <p>GM is working to cut $10bn in costs and raise $5bn from the sale of assets such as the Hummer brand. </p> <p>Critics have suggested the companies have been authors of their own downfall. The sclerotic US motor industry was still producing gas-guzzling four-wheel drives while Asian carmakers were producing smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles in tune with the market.</p> <p>The US government has promised $25bn in loans to help the industry develop more fuel-efficient cars.</p> <p>In Britain, GM employs almost 5,000 workers at two plants - Ellesmere Port in Cheshire, which produced 128,000 vehicles last year, and Luton, which last year made 66,000. Ellesmere Port has been scaling back - in 2005 it made 189,000.</p> <p>Ford employs about 12,500 people at sites in Dagenham, Bridgend, Southampton and Dunton in Essex. </p> <p>Workers have been put on a four-day week until the end of the year. A Ford spokesman said the four-day week seemed likely to be extended into 2009. </p> <p>\"We have to assess the market situation but the outlook isn't looking good,\" the spokesman said.</p>",

  "<p>In Understanding Media (1964), one of the pop-cultural bibles of the swinging 60s, the Canadian academic Marshall McLuhan singled out the ingredient that gave the decade its unique flavour. McLuhan believed he was living at a turning point in North American history because, for the first time, the sense of touch - and of sculptural values - was usurping the previously dominant sense of sight:</p> <blockquote> <p>In cars, clothes, in paperback books; in beards, babies and beehive hairdos, the American has declared for stress on touch, on participation, involvement, and sculptural values. America, once the land of an abstractly visual order, is profoundly \"in touch\" again with European traditions of food and life and art . .. Perhaps touch is not just skin contact with things, but the very life of things in the mind.</p> </blockquote> <p>McLuhan traced the origins of the 60s sensorium back to the avant-garde educational programme first developed at the Bauhaus in Germany during the 1920s, and then exported to America by refugees from the Nazis. The preliminary course at the Bauhaus featured compositional \"play\" with a wide variety of unorthodox materials and textures, but this approach had itself been heavily influenced by the revolutionary \"tactile\" education espoused by the Swiss-German kindergarten movement and by the Italian educational reformer Maria Montessori. If, as McLuhan believed, the stress on touch had now become \"the teenagers' norm\", such a proclivity would have begun in pre-school. Where grown-up art was concerned, McLuhan had his eye firmly fixed on New York, with its plethora of touchy-feely \"happenings\" and \"environments\", and its unruly gaggle of mixed-media assemblages, neo-dada and pop \"combines\" and reliefs. </p> <p>Had McLuhan been writing at the end of the 60s, he would have needed to cast his net much further south, all the way down the eastern American seaboard to Brazil. At the beginning of the decade, the Brazilian art scene, centred on S\u00e3o Paulo, had been dominated by various forms of geometrical abstraction inspired by the European constructivist movement: the greatest monument to this period in Brazilian art is Oscar Niemeyer's starkly limpid architecture for the administrative capital Brasilia, completed in 1960. But by the end of the decade, the creative centre of gravity had shifted to Rio de Janeiro, where a new kind of multimedia art had come to the fore that was intensely idiosyncratic and centred on the human body. The leading lights, Lygia Clark (1920-88) and H\u00e9lio Oiticica (1937-80), developed a \"multisensorial\" body art that featured all-enveloping environments and home-made bodysuits, capes, masks, blindfolds and restraints that appeared by turns fetishistic and futuristic, suicidal and predatory. These artists made much of being immersed in their immediate urban environment, and there can be little doubt they were inspired by the exuberant masquerades of the Rio carnival. </p> <p>The installation artist Cildo Meireles, who will be the first Brazilian artist accorded a full retrospective by the Tate, is one of the most important heirs to Clark and Oiticica. There is a rogue physicality to much of his work, yet it also manifests a formal elegance and economy that suggest he has learned from Niemeyer and from the geometrical abstraction of his youth. Meireles was born in Rio in 1948, but was brought up in Brasilia and attended its art school before returning to Rio, where he still lives. </p> <p>He first made his name on the international stage in 1970, when he was one of four Brazilian artists to participate in Information, an influential exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, that put conceptual art firmly on the map. Meireles exhibited Southern Cross (1969-70), a tiny wooden cube. One half was made from pine, the other from oak, and the two pieces were neatly glued together and sanded. This sugar-lump-sized cube has to be exhibited directly on the floor, and should ideally be displayed on its own in a large room. It is usually reproduced in larger-than-life close-up, balancing precariously on one of Meireles's fingertips: this is \"skin contact\" writ large - and small.</p> <p>Southern Cross is a minimalist sculpture, on a Lilliputian scale: Meireles calls it an example of \"humiliminimalism\" - a humble brand of minimalism. He wanted it to be even smaller, \"but when I sanded it down to my nails, I lost patience and stopped at 9mm\". But unlike most minimalist sculpture, it is no mere \"dumb\" object - or indeed a stray bit of Montessori apparatus. It is meant to be as richly symbolic, sensuous and potent as an amulet. </p> <p>Meireles's father worked for the Indian Protection Service, responsible for the rights of indigenous tribespeople, and is said to have instigated the first legal trials against racially motivated murders. From his father - and from an uncle who lived deep in the forest - Meireles learned of the native Tupi tribe's belief that oak and pine are sacred trees, and that fire was first discovered by the rubbing together of these two woods, with the softer pine bursting into flame. The potential for friction is further alluded to by the cube's being placed on Meireles's \"soft\" fingertip, as if he were about to flip it or roll it like a die, or knead it in the palm of his hand. In the catalogue for the New York exhibition, Meireles wove a Borgesian yarn about the \"eastern\" side of the cube representing modern urban Brazil and the \"western\" side representing the wild jungle side - though he didn't say which was which. </p> <p>The oak and pine cube might be said to reprise Constantin Brancusi's The Kiss, in which the rudimentary geometrical outline of two embracing lovers was incised into a single stone block, with no space between their bodies, or Lygia Clark's bodysuits that welded a man and a woman together, face to face. For most people, however, mention of \"southern cross\" in connection with an artist from Rio would conjure up images of the 100ft-high statue of Christ the redeemer, with outstretched, cruciform arms, that presides over the sprawling metropolis from a mountain top. Far from embracing the viewer like this archetypal catholic colossus, Meireles's miniature \"cross\" is a site of friction and collision, a crosscultural atom that may split or explode - or simply disappear - at any moment. </p> <p>At Tate Modern, more of Meireles's large installations will be exhibited than ever before, with many thrown together in an open-plan layout, while a new outdoor commission will be on view at Chelsea College of Art, next to Tate Britain. Last year, the Tate bought one of Meireles's most ambitious and interactive installations, Eureka/Blindhotland (1970-75), in which a large area is encircled by a curtain of black nylon fishing net. Strewn across the floor of the enclosure are 200 black rubber balls, all about the size of a football (Meireles is a big fan, admiring the game's subtlety and intricacy). At the centre of the space, looming over it all like a road sign or gallows, is a pair of scales perched high up on a pole. The scales are perfectly balanced, despite supporting objects that appear to be of different weights: on one scale a wooden cross; on the other, two slightly heavier-looking wooden blocks. </p> <p>The rubber balls are equally deceptive. They have been filled with different materials, and so their weights range from 150g to 1,500g. The viewers discover this for themselves, as they are allowed to come inside the enclosure and play around with the balls. The \"invisible\" variations in weight mean they could never quite be an emblem of the supremely beautiful game played by Pel\u00e9 and Jairzinho while winning the 1970 World Cup. All the while, a recording can be heard of the balls being dropped from different heights and at different distances from the microphone: overlaid sounds are a recurring feature in Meireles's \"multisensorial\" work.</p> <p>Meireles talks about this slightly menacing installation in a disengaged, quasi-scientific way, as if it were merely a psychological experiment, and the Archimedean \"eureka\" in the title adds to this impression: \"Blindhotland is the generic name given to a series of works begun in 1970, in which the dominance of the visual gives way to a 'blind' perception of reality through the senses of hearing, smell and taste; through awareness of density, heat, and so on.\" Yet the age-old symbol of justice is a blindfolded female figure who holds up a perfectly balanced pair of scales in one hand and a sword in the other. Meireles must have seen Alfredo Ceschiatti's hieratic seated granite statue of Justice (1960), sited outside Niemeyer's Supreme Court in Brasilia, on numerous occasions. She is blindfolded, and lays her sword horizontally across her lap so that it doubles up as a pair of scales that are permanently in balance. </p> <p>A political reading of Blindhotland, in which the installation would imply that public as well as private judgments must be \"blind\" in order to get to the truth, is hard to avoid. A military junta, partly backed by the United States, had been in power in Brazil since 1964, and would continue to rule until 1984. After student protests in 1968, habeas corpus was suspended and a nationwide state of siege declared. In 1969, rebels kidnapped the US ambassador, but the rebel leader was assassinated soon after. Judicial torture and murder of political opponents, as well as \"disappearances\", were regular occurrences. </p> <p>Other works by Meireles from the period responded more overtly to the increasingly bleak political situation. Also in 1970, Meireles made a series of Insertions into Ideological Circuits, in which he doctored money and consumer items before putting them back into circulation. Banknotes were stamped with political slogans, such as \"Who killed Herzog?\" (Herzog was a journalist who died in prison), and had their value changed to \"ZERO CRUZEIRO\". Portraits of national heroes were replaced by images of a native Indian and a psychiatric patient. The same treatment was meted out to US dollars, and Coca-Cola bottles were inscribed with \"Yankees Go Home\" before being recycled under a deposit system. In the late 60s, many artists in Europe and America espoused dadaistic \"guerrilla\" tactics in their art - or \"interventions\", as they were known. Germano Celant's famous first manifesto for Italian Arte Povera, published in 1967, was subtitled Notes for a Guerrilla War. But few western artists were as bold, or needed to be as brave, as Meireles.</p> <p>His most shocking work was also made at this time, the performance piece Tiradentes: Totem-Monument to the Political Prisoner (1970). Tiradentes was a national hero who organised the first uprising against Portuguese rule in 1789, but three years later he was hanged and quartered. The military junta tried to co-opt Tiradentes, and the exhibition at which Meireles's piece was showcased coincided with a nationwide programme celebrating him as a great patriot. The exhibition, entitled From Body to Earth, was held in various locations in the city of Belo Horizonte. On a building site outside the main art gallery, Meireles tied 10 live hens to a wooden stake impaled in the ground, at the top of which was a clinical thermometer. He then doused the hens in petrol and set fire to them. He has since said: \"Of course I would never repeat a work like Tiradentes ... I can still hear those poor hens in my emotional memory. But in 1970 I felt it had to be done.\"</p> <p>A later installation/performance piece that lasted for 24 hours, The Sermon on the Mount: Let there be Light (1973/79), captured the tensions of the time with a mordent wit. At first glance, it looks like a pale imitation of Andy Warhol's Brillo boxes exhibition, for the gallery was dominated by a large, neatly stacked pile of uniformly labelled boxes. But there was a striking difference, for the pile was made out of 126,000 Fiat Lux matchboxes (Fiat Lux means \"let there be light\"), and rather amazingly the manufacturers of the matches had sponsored the show by donating them. The precious pile was guarded by five male actors dressed as plain clothes security guards, wearing dark shades and with one hand slipped inside their jackets as if searching for a weapon. Meireles has observed: \"The accumulated Fiat Lux matchboxes had the potential to create a huge explosion. Danger is a constitutive element in these works. Psychologically, when you come into contact with danger, your senses become more alert: you not only see but feel with greater intensity. My idea was to take away the psychological crutches.\" This \"living dangerously\" phase culminates with Volatile (1980/94), an installation in which a solitary candle burned at the end of an enclosed room, its floor covered with a thick layer of ash. Natural gas was pumped into the room, filling the spectators' nostrils, making them fear for their own safety. </p> <p>The bulk of Meireles's best work was made, or conceived, under the military dictatorship, and most of the work in the Tate retrospective comes from this period, with very little from after 1990. It only goes to show that no necessary connection exists between good art and good governance, freedom and well-being, though we have been inclined to believe this ever since Winckelmann in the 18th century claimed that Greek art was great because it was made by free and fit men living under serene skies. The high quality of the art emerging from New York in the cold war period, from the abstract expressionists onwards, was frequently put down to the fact that all these artists were living in a \"free\" society.</p> <p>The finest piece from the post-1984 period is Mission/Missions (How to Build Cathedrals) (1987), which was shown at the ICA in London in 1990. This is the most visually spectacular of all his installations, and the most explicitly religious. It was made for an exhibition exploring the Jesuit missions to South America between 1610 and 1767, when the Jesuits were themselves suppressed by the papacy. Around 600,000 coins are laid out like a square carpet on the gallery floor, and from the mid-point, a thin column of communion wafers rises around eight feet into the air where it meets a matching suspended square canopy made from 2,000 bones. Meireles has explained: \"I wanted to construct something that would be a kind of mathematical equation, very simple and direct, connecting three elements: material power, spiritual power, and a kind of unavoidable, historically repeated consequence of this conjunction, which was tragedy. I wanted a sky of bones, a floor of money, and a column of communion wafers to unite these two elements.\" Here, as so often in Meireles's work, mathematics is moralised and given a troublingly tangible architecture.</p> <p>\u2022 Cildo Meireles is at Tate Modern, London SE1, from October 14 to January 11.

  "<p>Call it a crash, call it a rout, but please don't describe yesterday's selling as irrational. The frightening part is that so many of the pressures on the market could be explained. If you were a shareholder in an American bank, would you want to own your stock over a long weekend?

The world's major central banks managed to cut interest rates in a coordinated manner on Wednesday, but saving the global banking system in an afternoon is a bigger job.</p> <p>Brave souls on Wall Street dared to hope for the best, triggering extraordinary volatility in the final hour of trading. The Dow Jones industrial average, having been down 500 points on the day, was briefly up almost 300 points. It settled at 8451, down 128 points. The statistics for the week tell the story, however. The Dow fell 18.1%; in London, the FTSE 100 lost 21%, or about 1,000 points; similar falls were suffered by most of the world's major stockmarkets.</p> <p>It seems clear that many market operators are in the same position as Robert Tchenguiz, who was forced this week to sell his stakes in Sainsbury's and Mitchells &amp; Butlers when his backer, Icelandic bank Kaupthing, called in its loan. Most of these forced sellers are hedge funds. Their backers, the big banks, are cutting credit lines and their investors are asking to redeem their investments. It's anybody's guess how much further this process of liquidation has to run.</p> <p>The biggest worry is perhaps the spectre of Japan, where the Nikkei stock average peaked at 39,000 in 1989 and now stands below 9,000. The parallels with Japanese experience are becoming alarming - a banking crisis followed by government-sponsored bail-outs and deep interest rate cuts. The medicine saved Japan's financial system, but destroyed returns for stock market investors for a generation.</p> <p>One theory is that Japan waited too long to take its medicine. But, when a single meeting of the G7 is billed as a make-or-break moment for the financial system, it is hard to argue the scale of today's global crisis was appreciated in time.</p> <p>Investors have also learned the best short-term guide to progress is Libor - the rate at which banks lend to each other. This shows no sign of falling, despite the interest rate cuts and despite the government's \u00a3500bn rescue plan. Banks continue to hoard cash. Until the rate falls, it is impossible to say that politicians' efforts to unblock the system are succeeding, even if their diagnosis of the problem - lack of capital in the banking system - is correct. But, you might ask, hasn't anybody read their investment bibles recently? \"Be fearful when others are greedy, be greedy when others are fearful,\" said billionaire investor Warren Buffett. Buy at \"the moments of maximum pessimism\", said Sir John Templeton.</p> <p>Well, yes, it is possible that yesterday could turn out to have been the greatest buying opportunity since March 2003, when the FTSE 100 fell below 3300 before roaring back to 4400 by the end of the year. It is easy to imagine a big, bold response by the G7, such as a global agreement to guarantee interbank lending for three months, could restore confidence, force banks to resume lending and prompt a sharp stockmarket rebound. One can also see how sharp falls in prices of commodities such as oil and copper contain the seeds of recovery. So, yes, disaster could be averted.</p> <p>But we have also seen spirals of selling in the past. This week's has been as vicious as any in the past few decades. The forces must blow themselves out eventually but, when serious voices are advocating the complete nationalisation of the west's banking systems, comparisons with relatively recent crises such as 1987 or 1998 are redundant.</p> <p>Not many people are reading Buffett and Templeton now. JK Galbraith's The Great Crash, the classic analysis of 1929, is the text that's flying off the shelves.</p>",
  "<p>Hamish Low finished his MA in media, peace and conflict studies at the University for Peace in Costa Rica this summer. </p> <p>\"It's a little university of 150 students from 50 countries,\" he explains. He travelled from his home country of New Zealand to study there because \"it's a unique environment, and there are no master's level programmes in what I wanted to study at home \". Now living in London, Low is interested in beginning a career in the media and communications side of an NGO. \" I'd like to be able to contribute to creating progressive social change,\" <br>he says. </p> <p>We asked Leigh Daynes, head of media and public affairs at the British Red Cross, to mock interview Low for an entry-level job. Then we asked him what he thought. \"The British Red Cross is primarily an emergency response organisation, domestically and overseas ,\" he says. </p> <p>Daynes explains that an effective media operation is key even to humanitarian organisations. \"The voluntary sector is competitive,\" he says. \"We're all competing for the public's attention . Effective communication is an <br>integral part of the mission.\" </p> <p>The media team aims to be as dynamic as possible. \"The newsdesk actively responds to events and tries to set our own agenda,\" he says. \"The features desk has a more human interest focus .\" Though a professional media approach is necessary, Daynes adds that it's also vital to be committed to <br>the work of the organisation. \"I don't know anyone here who isn't passionate <br>about what they do,\" he says. </p> <p>Low impressed Daynes on this score: \"He was enthusiastic about the value of an organisation like the Red Cross and his role within it.\" </p> <p>Daynes points out that jobs within the sector are in great demand. \" Our brand attracts huge attention,\" he says. \"We are spoilt for choice and it's unrealistic to say otherwise.\" Candidates need to work hard to stand out. \"Some direct work experience within the sector is always an advantage,\" Daynes says. </p> <p>He thinks that Low could benefit from some more practical experience. \"He also needs to focus on exactly where he wants to place himself within an organisation.\" </p> <p>Low impressed with his communication and interpersonal skills. \"He was animated, articulate and engaged,\" says Daynes, \"and he obviously has very strong interpersonal skills ; I felt he would work well within the team.\" </p> <p>Haynes believes that Low will have a successful career in the voluntary sector. \"He might want to look at policy, advocacy and research,\" he says, \"but you can always tell people who will shine and I think Hamish just needs the right opportunity and he would, brightly.\" </p> <p>Low agrees with the assessment that he will need to gain some more experience \u2014 and that it's a hard sector in which to find a first job. \"It's difficult to get a job without the right experience and if you can't do an unpaid placement it's difficult to get the experience,\" he says. \"It's a catch 22, and I don't have the answers.\" But he was pleased with his performance in the interview and with the outcome of it. \"It was very helpful,\" he says, \"and I got some good advice.\" </p> <p><strong>Scorecard</strong></p> <p>Employability <strong>8/10</strong>; Presentation <strong>7/10</strong>; Preparation <strong>8/10</strong></p> <p>\u2022 If you are an undergraduate or recent graduate in need of a career blind date, send your CV to <a href=\"mailto:graduate@theguardian.com\">graduate@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The publication of the principles for sovereign wealth funds at the IMF meeting comes at a timely moment (IMF prepares $200bn fund to shore up stricken states, October 10). The global financial instability has reminded us of the need to explore alternative forms of investment. With an estimated $3tn in assets under management - a figure that is expected to rise to $13.4tn within a decade - SWFs are among the few players in the financial sector that can inject the massive amounts of capital and liquidity needed to restore confidence in our markets. <br>SWFs are still viewed with suspicion. In particular, the US and European governments have expressed concerns over the government-owned nature of SWFs, and that investments are driven by political rather than commercial objectives. In fact, SWFs have avoided politically sensitive sectors, seldom take a controlling stake in companies from OECD member countries and justify investments on purely commercial grounds. The publication of these principles should serve to facilitate this mutually beneficial relationship and persuade western governments to avoid a protectionist stance, while encouraging the funds to increase transparency and accountability.<br><strong>Roland Rudd</strong><br>Chairman, Business for New Europe </p> <p>We have blamed the free market and the fat cats. What about the assumption that the economy can and should go on growing at 2% for ever? How is this possible in a world of finite resources? What about peak oil and climate change? Maybe the recession will give economists time for some really radical rethinking.<br><strong>Bill North</strong><br>Dorchester, Dorset</p>",
  "<p><strong>What happens if there is no international rescue plan?</strong></p> <p>The global financial system is teetering on the brink and world leaders need to come up with some sort of concerted effort to save it. If they fail to act, the world economy could deteriorate into a long-lasting depression. </p> <p><strong>Is it time to panic?</strong></p> <p>World stockmarkets are showing signs of panic selling. The global financial system is looking extremely fragile and we are heading for an international recession. There are no riots in the streets, but now is probably the time to recession-proof your finances.</p> <p><strong>How do I protect my money?</strong></p> <p>If you are concerned about losing your job, it is prudent to pay off as much debt as possible. But paying into a pension should be the last expense to cut back as retirement savings benefit from lucrative tax breaks.</p> <p><strong>Is it safe in the bank?</strong></p> <p>Now is the time to opt for safety. It is worth shunning more exotic foreign banks which often offer high rates of interest in favour of those that benefit from a government guarantee. The British government has not allowed any savers to lose out and there appears to be an implicit guarantee on savings in the high street banks. Ireland has explicitly guaranteed all its deposits. If you are worried, it is worth splitting savings between banks so that you do not have more than \u00a350,000 in a single account. This amount is protected by the financial industry's compensation scheme.</p> <p><strong>Can governments afford guarantees?</strong></p> <p>Probably not. A guarantee is a bit like an insurance policy - as long as few people claim, it is affordable. If every bank were to fail, the government would struggle to honour its commitments.</p> <p><strong>Could a big British bank go bust?</strong></p> <p>In theory, yes. But the government is standing behind the UK's leading banks. It will nationalise a big bank rather than see one fail.</p> <p><strong>What happens if governments can't pay their debts?</strong></p> <p>There is no official insolvency procedure for a country. But if governments renege on debts, they are effectively declaring the country bankrupt. Argentina could not pay creditors in 1999, leading to a run on the banks and the eventual freezing of all the country's bank accounts for a year. Countries that fail to pay debts subsequently find it difficult to raise money on international markets, exacerbating their problems.</p> <p><strong>Why don't governments print more money?</strong></p> <p>It is possible to print money as a way out of an economic crisis, but this reduces its value, causing inflation. Zimbabwe now has inflation of 231m%, after it increased the supply of money.</p>",
  "<p>Finance ministers from the G7 knew what they had to do when they met last night: come up with a rescue plan for the global system which would be simple, decisive, coordinated and swift. And, unlike any of the other plans over the past 14 months, it would have to be effective.</p> <p>Faced with what they accepted was the threat of financial meltdown, policymakers had to think the unthinkable. Ideas floated in Washington yesterday were not remotely in prospect even a month ago. But the sense of urgency had increased since the collapse of Lehman, last month propelled the crisis into a dangerous phase.</p> <p>There are now few takers for the old purist approach of allowing banks to fail, with the \"creative destruction\" giving a leaner and cleaner system. Advocates of this \"Austrian school\" may still exist in universities, but not in any of the G7 finance ministries.</p> <p>Henry Paulson, the US treasury secretary, had appeared to dabble with this sink-or-swim philosophy when he allowed Lehman to go bust, but the subsequent market mayhem has pushed him in completely the opposite direction.</p> <p>Last night it was nationalisation rather than a free-market solution that looked more likely, even after the G7 unveiled its five-point blueprint to end a month of financial chaos. It is accepted that if the current plan to calm the markets through state-backed recapitalisation of banks fails, then there will be no alternative but for governments to take them over - lock, stock and barrel.</p> <p>Paulson's initial answer, the $700bn troubled-asset recovery plan, was supposed to be a turning point in the 14-month credit crunch, but in Washington last night he said the Bush administration now sees it only as a partial solution.</p> <p>The US will draw up its own plan to pour public money into Wall Street banks after studying the emergency proposals outlined by Alistair Darling to save UK banks from imminent collapse.</p> <p>For the chancellor's plan to work internationally, three things would need to happen. First, all G7 countries would have to back taking stakes in their banks, something the communique released last night endorsed. Second, loans between banks in the interbank market would have to be guaranteed, provided they sign up to the government's recapitalisation programme and pay for the privilege.</p> <p>It is the total shutdown of interbank markets which, more than anything, scared the authorities into action, because it is now clear that the drying up of credit is starting to impact on the ability of businesses and households to function.</p> <p>Under the Darling proposal, and now being considered elsewhere, the government stands behind any trade between banks, thereby allowing the interbank market to thaw out. Again, this idea was backed last night by the G7.</p> <p>While the first two elements increase the supply of credit, central banks also recognise that demand for loans has been severely shaken by the crisis. So the third leg is for coordinated interest rate cuts of the sort seen on Wednesday. Just weeks ago, the Bank of England was fretting about the possible risk of inflation becoming ingrained: events of the past month have banished such concern.</p> <p>These three seen by Darling and Mervyn King, the Bank's governor, as a comprehensive package - but if it fails to restore confidence, there are a few shots left in the locker.</p> <p>One is for central banks to use their balance sheets to buy up all the debts of the commercial banks - a step governments would take with extreme reluctance since it exposes the taxpayer to huge risk.</p> <p>A second idea would be a blanket guarantee for all lending in the interbank markets. Again, this is treated with caution, since it would be tantamount to nationalisation.</p> <p>Finally, policymakers could, in extreme circumstances, simply flood the financial system with money.</p>",
  "<p>Anxiety levels in the global financial markets were ratcheted up yesterday after credit derivatives linked to the failed US investment bank Lehman Brothers, with a face value estimated at $200bn (\u00a3118bn) to $440bn, began to be unwound. </p> <p>Many banks are involved in the credit derivatives market and are exposed to the Lehman default. They include RBS and Barclays which could be forced to make further writedowns if they fail to recover all of their money.</p> <p>Financial firms sold credit default swaps (CDSs) - a form of insurance against a company defaulting on its debt - to investors in Lehman's bonds and those betting on the bank's creditworthiness. These companies will now be forced to pay out 91.4 cents in the dollar. The figure is more than market expectations for losses on underlying Lehman bonds.</p> <p>Banks around the world are hoarding cash partly in preparation for the settlement of these credit derivatives linked to a wave of major corporate defaults and lower than expected recovery levels. There have been seven major defaults in the past month, including those by US mortgage giants Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and banking group Washington Mutual. Most recently a rash of Icelandic banking failures have added to the sense of foreboding. </p> <p>\"There are going to be others,\" said one credit analyst. \"This is just the start.\"</p> <p>Sandy Chen, an analyst at Panmure Gordon, said a \"rough guess\" suggested the Icelandic banks alone could trigger gross credit default swap payouts estimated at $200bn, though net payouts would be much lower. Credit derivative prices show investors believe many large companies are close to collapse. The annual cost of insuring \u00a310m of Morgan Stanley's debt against default is now trading at \u00a32.5m, implying a very high risk the bank could fail.</p> <p>In the almost unregulated credit derivatives market, no one knows the scale of Lehman CDSs that have been bought and sold - estimates range from $250bn to $440bn. Market experts expect many of these positions to be offset as many investors are thought to have hedged some or all of their risk on Lehman credit derivatives. Michael Hampden-Turner, a credit analyst at Citigroup, said he expected the net payout on Lehman CDSs to be closer to $10bn. However, he noted that the lower than expected recovery rate on credit derivatives was likely to further fuel market concerns about the impact of future defaults. </p> <p>Other analysts have pointed to concern that the recent run of large-scale defaults may leave many hedge funds with payout demands they cannot meet. This in turn may force writedowns for those failing to receive the payouts, many of them major banks. </p> <p>Chen described the prospect of mass payment failures as \"key drivers of the current apocalypse\". He singled out Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland as being most exposed among the UK banks to the credit derivatives market. Both have bought and sold, in roughly equal measure, \u00a32.4 trillion of such contracts.</p> <p>Chen believes Barclays and RBS are highly likely to be prominent among those required to pay out on Lehman CDSs. Meanwhile, counterparties failing to meet their payout obligations to the two banks could lead to big writedowns. </p> <p>\"Against this, tangible shareholders' equity bases of \u00a320bn to \u00a330bn seem like cloth tents in a hurricane,\" Chen said.</p>",
  "<p>Letters penned by Albert Einstein, which reveal his views on how to deal with a belligerent Russia after the second world war and which dismiss as \"twaddle\" the notion that his theories are hard to understand, will go under the hammer on Thursday.</p> <p>The sale, in London, will be watched carefully as a letter in which the scientist branded religious beliefs as \"childish superstitions\" and the \"product of human weaknesses\" - bid for unsuccessfully by the biologist Richard Dawkins who wanted it for his foundation - fetched the record amount of \u00a3170,000 this May. </p> <p>In this batch of letters Einstein shows himself to be quite a diplomat but withering towards \"superficial journalists\" who failed to understand his theories. His advice on dealing with the USSR will strike a chord with western governments today pondering Russia's invasion of Georgia. </p> <p>Einstein's correspondent, the psychoanalyst Walter Marseille, had promoted the idea of a world government in a paper entitled A Method to Enforce World Peace, which he sent to the scientist and to the philosopher Bertrand Russell. </p> <p>In correspondence to Marseille in 1948 Einstein wrote: \"Better to let Russia see that there is nothing to be achieved by aggression but there are advantages in joining [a world government]: then the Russian regime's attitude will probably change and they will take part without compulsion.\" </p> <p>In a later missive Einstein again advocated a diplomatic approach. \"The attitude of the Russians, it seems to me, clearly shows that they are deeply concerned about the military-industrial situation, and that they would be prepared to make considerable concessions if some degree of relaxation was permitted.\" </p> <p>In a third letter he wrote: \"In my view it is much better, both morally and practically, to attempt to bring about a state of affairs in which the Russians, out of pure self interest, find it preferable to give up their separatist position.\"</p> <p>Simon Luterbacher, who is handling the sale for Bloomsbury Auctions, said the four letters to Marseille offered a great insight into Einstein's thoughts on world affairs. \"I think Einstein was much more open to the suggestion that you could make a deal, or you could learn to live with what was the USSR,\" he said.</p> <p>Luterbacher said the letters to Marseille were not grandstanding by the great physicist. \"He viewed them as private correspondence. They were not for global publicity so he's just expressing his opinions.\"</p> <p>In one lot for the auction is a hand-written letter to Adrien Wils, a member of the public who wrote to Einstein criticising his \"theory of relativity\". In the letter to Wils, which has never been in a public sale before, Einstein countered the idea that his theory could be equated with moral relativism. He wrote: \"This topic has nothing to do with the superficial statement that 'everything is relative' ... this is, by the way, not a philosophical theory, but purely physical.\" In the letter he chided journalists for failing to understand one of his greatest scientific achievements. \"The twaddle that the theory is extremely difficult to understand is complete nonsense, spread out by superficial journalists.\"</p> <p>Speaking of the scientist's communications, Harvey Brown, an Einstein biographer, said he must have had a huge postbag: \"But I think he did make an effort to respond to as many as he could. He even wrote back to children.\"</p> <p>Luterbacher expects the Wils letter to sell for \u00a36,000-\u00a38,000, and the four Marseille letters to make up to \u00a36,000. </p> <p>In 2007 a letter from Einstein on world government went for $9,000 (\u00a35,000). In 2006 a six-page scientific essay, plus a letter, by the physicist fetched \u00a3300,000.</p>",
  "<p>Channel 4 yesterday abandoned for financial reasons its ambitious plan to take on the BBC with a string of new digital radio stations, potentially dealing a blow to the future of the medium in the UK. </p> <p>More than 2 years after the plan was announced and over a year since a Channel 4-led consortium won the right to launch 10 digital stations, the chief executive, Andy Duncan, ditched the idea. The broadcaster said last month it would cut 150 jobs as part of an attempt to save \u00a3100m over the next two years in the face of an advertising slump and structural problems that it claims will leave it facing a funding gap of \u00a3150m by 2012. </p> <p>Ofcom had hoped the new entrant would provide competition to the BBC and pioneer a new commercial model for digital radio. Abandoning the scheme will save \u00a310m next year. The radio plans had already cost around \u00a34m and the decision to abandon them is likely to leave Bob Shennan, the former BBC Radio 5 Live controller hired to run them, out of a job. In all there will be 15 redundancies as a result of the closure of the division. </p> <p>\"We've taken this decision very reluctantly,\" Duncan said yesterday. \"We've pursued our radio plans in good faith and continue to believe DAB has a strong future and that we could make a return from radio in the medium term.</p> <p>\"Frustratingly, our plans have been overtaken by a drastic recent downturn in our revenues. We can no longer afford the short-term investment necessary given that we are having to cut so deeply across all parts of the organisation.\"</p> <p>Ofcom said it would consult the other members of the consortium, in which Channel 4 was a 55% shareholder, on what to do next. </p> <p>Simon Cole, chief executive of radio producer UBC, a minority shareholder in the planned consortium, said: \"There could be a platform for more national services in the next 18 months. It's a possibility, but no more than that. Channel 4 created a lot of excitement, which then fizzled away to nothing, which is a shame.\" </p> <p>The commercial prospects of DAB radio were dealt a blow earlier this year when GCap withdrew its digital-only stations prior to its takeover by Global. But the Digital Radio Development Bureau said that with 7.7m sets in circulation and sales up by a fifth year on year, the medium still had a future. Its chief executive, Tony Moretta, said: \"The medium has made good, steady progress... we will continue to see new stations launching on DAB in the coming months.\" </p> <p>The government and Ofcom set up a working group after GCap's decision to try to find a way forward for the medium. It is due to report in November. </p> <p>Apart from Channel 4 staff, the biggest blow will be to the independent radio production sector, which had hoped the new stations would lead to a boost for the sector similar to that in television when Channel 4 was launched 26 years ago. </p> <p>Neil Gardner, who chairs the Radio Independents Group trade body, said: \"This is a real blow for the future of creative competition in radio programme making. Channel 4 Radio would have brought a much needed boost to the UK's independent radio production sector, and stimulated BBC radio into a more open and creative relationship with radio indies.\"</p>",

  "<p>There's always somebody trying to pull a fast one, but we can help ourselves. \"The antidotes to delusion are logic and evidence, preferably from multiple sources.\" The author hopes to give us the tools to avoid being fooled by \"pseudo-news\", as well as pseudo-experts, and pseudo-conspiracy theories. Confusingly, many of the people we ought to be sceptical of pretend to be sceptics themselves. The giveaway, as Wilson nicely shows, is that their scepticism is asymmetrical: no evidence is ever enough for someone \"sceptical\" about anthropogenic global warming (an example not included in this book), and yet they are remarkably credulous about any alternative factoids that might seem to support their own view. </p> <p>Wilson ranges somewhat loosely over examples contemporary and historical: anti-Aids science in South Africa, Lysenko's pseudo-agriculture, David Irving's Holocaust denial, Richard Dawkins's atheism, and torture at Abu Ghraib, explaining psychological ideas of selection bias and groupthink along the way. He alludes to the X-Files slogan \"I want to believe\" as an example of dangerous thinking, but to be fair they also say \"Trust no one.\"</p>",
  "<p>\"The global economy is in its fifth year of robust growth,\" began the statement from Alistair Darling and his fellow finance ministers from the G7 rich nations in October 2007. Sure, the credit crunch was already biting and Northern Rock was hooked up to government life support, but the men and women running the world's most powerful economies were glass-half-full types. \"We have acted resolutely to protect the systemic stability of global financial markets\", they said, and concluded that the outlook was one of \"strong global fundamentals\" and \"well-capitalised financial institutions\".</p> <p>Those same oracles are meeting again this weekend in Washington, except this time there is no room for self-delusion. There are two types of G7 summit. The first are exercises in back-slapping. This one must fall into the second category: as with the Gleneagles commitment in 2005 to boost aid to Africa, or the 1985 Plaza accord to weaken the dollar and so boost the US economy, leaders need to come up with bold action - now. They have time, just, and an almost intolerable amount of pressure: if rich nations cannot agree this weekend on a plan to stem the banking crisis, the panic seen in financial markets yesterday will be nothing compared to what happens on Monday.</p> <p>What should a rescue plan look like? There are two essential preconditions. First, it must be global. So far, only the US and UK have announced a full-blown scheme. But this is a global crisis that demands a global solution. Second, any announcement must have meat, rather than bare bones. Diplomacy is often a game of holding statements and consensual platitudes; this time, these will have worse than no effect. Instead, a timetable should set out the steps to be taken by all countries, and when they will take them.</p> <p>If there is a saving grace in this bleak situation, it is this: different governments need not do different things; they need only do the same things. That is surely easier to manage, especially with the powerful incentive that countries which stand apart are likely to be picked off by financial markets. The common steps this paper would suggest start with an unlimited guarantee on deposits in domestic banks. Such assurances have been undermined by the uncertainty over how nearly bankrupt Iceland will redeem its savers' money. Nevertheless, they are an essential way of stemming panic among bank customers and for governments to show voters that their interests are being protected. As George Bush remarked yesterday afternoon, \"anxiety can feed anxiety\" - it is essential that governments soothe that anxiety. Officials should also be prepared to suspend trading in securities in the banking and insurance sectors. The wild swings seen yesterday on stockmarkets surely make any bank rescue as hard as standing on the sea.</p> <p>The next move is for each treasury to call in their most important banks, work out which are not viable, and wind them up. Most of the other institutions will need capital injections, which governments should give in return for equity stakes, and conditions that executives do not throw away capital on bonuses and dividend payments. Officials also have to increase liquidity by underwriting all lending between banks. Finally, there needs to be action to boost the wider economy. As it is, the best case now looks like a global recession next year. As that outlook gets worse, individuals and businesses will default on their loans, and the banking crisis will intensify. Big central banks should cut interest rates again this week, by half a percentage point or more. And governments must start raising public spending or cutting taxes. These suggestions are aimed at the short term, at restoring stability to banks rather than reforming them. They certainly do not replace an overhaul of the financial system. But that must come later. The priority now is to stop a financial crisis turning into a depression.</p>",
  "<p>I walked along our high street looking for signs of fear. The woman in the newsagent said things weren't too bad, the greengrocer said trade was down a little but not as much as his competitors'. The wine merchant said people were still drinking as much, though buying cheaper bottles Monday to Thursday and saving the pricey stuff for the weekend; they must be staying at home more, he said, and avoiding restaurants. None of this seemed to amount to the pop-eyed fear that Franklin D Roosevelt summoned up in his \"the only thing we have to fear is fear itself\" speech. </p> <p>\"Nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror\" was how he went on to describe it during his inaugural presidential address in 1933 (an event which came in the middle of a stock market crash, to which his words were at least party directed). But then fear doesn't always have a visual manifestation - frantic queues outside a bank, or the old lady with glasses looking up at a Cossack sabre in Battleship Potemkin. Neither is it always easily articulated. </p> <p>\"It looks as though it's going to get rough,\" I said to the greengrocer. </p> <p>\"Yeah, very, very rough,\" the greengrocer replied, handing me my grapes. </p> <p>No more was said. At Canary Wharf, London, things were the same. The escalators at its tube stop always promise to deliver you into a thriller. From deep down in the station you can see the sky - a white horizon across which silhouettes pass like Alfred Hitchcock's in one of his films. When I reached the top I saw a cheering newspaper placard, TYCOONS LOSE BILLIONS IN CASH, but otherwise life looked normal, or what has passed for normal in the last dozen years. It was lunchtime and the sun shone. News of stock price movements and exchange rate fluctuations ran around the curves of the Thomson Reuter building on its twinkling signboard. On a big TV screen, somebody that nobody had ever heard of had won the Nobel prize. The crowd beneath ate, drank and studied its BlackBerrys. Smollensky's, Carluccio's, the Slug and Lettuce - names that one day will suggest a different age, like ABC teashops do the war - all had their tables full. </p> <p>I walked east as far as Cartier Circle and looked across the Thames at the dome. When I worked at Canary Wharf in what was known as \"the tower\", because in 1994 there was only one, only a fraction of this townscape existed. From our offices on the 18th floor we had clear views in every direction. To the west we looked towards St Paul's, down a road lined with office blocks that had actually been completed: we called this The Avenue of the Rise of Capitalism. Towards the east and Essex was The Avenue of the Decline of Capitalism - abandoned building plots that looked as though they might never see a digger again. Here it was just possible to see the outlines of Canary Wharf's original function; until the 1970s it was a dock where fruit was unloaded from the islands of the same name. Recession had halted further progress; its owners were so desperate for tenants, and its rents so cheap, that even marginally profitable businesses such as newspapers moved in. But then recession turned to boom, history was obliterated, and Canary Wharf resumed and eventually fulfilled its ambition to be Manhattan in Europe. </p> <p>Even now, the brakes have still to be applied. Developers and speculators may be frantically doing the maths in private, but the evidence on the ground suggests ever onward and upward. Around Cartier Circle, lorries deliver more concrete, steel and glass to builders in hard hats. In a shopping mall already stuffed with little luxuries, Charbonnel et Walker promise that a new \"chocolate cafe\" is coming soon. Canary Wharf's weekly free sheet splashes with a story that a new development, Wood Wharf, will have a 200-metre tower, offering 25,000 permanent jobs, though it won't be completed before 2019. </p> <p>Where is the fear here, that \"nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror\"? Our prosperity may be approaching a chasm - a global recession of a kind not known in our lifetime - but the chocolate soldiers of Charbonnel et Walker bravely advance. Yet everyday life has always been a poor guide to the future. Old habits die hard. Arnold Bennett, one of the last century's most observant diarists, writing two days after Britain declared war on Germany in 1914, noted: \"A great crowd of holiday makers at Clacton in the showers yesterday. No difficulty about getting change for a \u00a310 in gold and silver. At the fish shop, slight increases of price in poultry and eggs.\" </p> <p>And so at Canary Wharf I abandoned the search for outward signs in other behaviours and examined myself. During the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, I stood on the school playing fields and looked back at the school and thought, \"All this might vanish.\" Time of day, weather, location: all are still vivid in my memory. Not since then, not even after 9/11, have I known such brooding anxiety or such a compulsion to watch the BBC news. It doesn't seem shameful to me. </p> <p>Roosevelt tried to give fear a bad name with his rhetoric - surely the \"nameless\" is included, wrongly, only because politicians deploy adjectives in threes. In fact, it is one of our most useful emotions. As Joanna Bourke points out in her study of the subject (Fear: a Cultural History), \"We are right to fear. A world without fear would be a dull world indeed. It is sobering to contemplate a world where parents did not fear for their children or where death was as insignificant as eating a meal.\"</p> <p>Think of its accomplishments. Road safety, smoking bans, carbon-emission charts, law enforcement of all kinds, the human creativity born out of fear of loneliness or rejection. Fear, says Bourke, quoting an earlier writer, \"must have been the first and for a long while the most powerful of all the traits of human mentality, the one from which the higher faculties had to evolve.\" It was fear that cured the Cuban crisis. A little more of it in the years leading to 1914 might have saved the lives of many of the bathers that Bennett saw on Clacton beach. Fear also leads to curiosity. How come Iceland, a tiny nation built on thermal springs and shrinking fish stocks, had so much money apparently at its disposal? The question might have prevented several British charities and local authorities from making investment decisions that now look like folly. </p> <p>Perhaps fear's importance has dwindled, or perhaps been repressed, as an ever-present component of modern feeling. Bourke's book, tellingly, never explores its influence on financial markets, perhaps because she was writing it in the early 2000s when great slumps seemed historic and terrorism a new thing. To learn how economic fear shaped the lives of our ancestors, we need older texts. </p> <p>Home from Canary Wharf, I dipped again into Studs Terkel's great work of oral history, Hard Times, which recounts hundreds of individual Americans' stories from the great depression as seen from the perspective of 1970. In one way or another, fear marks most of them. The account of Virginia Durr, an elderly woman in Alabama, ends the book. </p> <p>\"The depression affected people in two different ways. The great majority reacted by thinking money is the most important thing in the world. Get yours. And get it for your children. Nothing else matters. Not having that stark terror come at you again.\" The second? \"A small number of people who felt the system was lousy. You have to change it.\" </p> <p>As fear's engulfing wave rolls into our lives again - rough, very rough - it seems safe to bet that the same division will become more and more apparent, and in the same proportion.</p>",
  "<p>As European fans bask in the glow of a new Heineken Cup season, the rumblings of discontent from the rest of the world grow ever louder. Down a crackling phone line from Wellington yesterday, there was even a stark global health warning from Steve Tew, chief executive of the New Zealand Rugby Union. According to Tew, the International Rugby Board urgently needs to address the \"player drain\" from south to north if it wishes to safeguard the long-term future of Test rugby.</p> <p>It is Tew's view that the sheer number of New Zealanders, and others, plying their trade overseas is a worry for the game in both hemispheres. It is now possible, for example, to pick a side composed purely of Heineken Cup-registered Kiwis, several in the prime of their careers.</p> <p>\"There is no doubt the player drain is having an effect on people here,\" said Tew, reiterating his union's \"concern\" at the widening gulf between rugby's haves and have-nots. In light of the global economic crisis, he fears for All Black rugby - \"We just can't compete on the financial front\" - unless something is done to reduce the one-way traffic.</p> <p>As a direct consequence, proposals to revamp the Super 14 are being considered, including a suggestion that franchises such as the Crusaders and the Hurricanes revert to their original provincial identities (as Canterbury and Wellington, respectively, in this instance) in order to boost waning interest and reduce costs. Expanding the competition to allow for more domestic fixtures and reduce the amount of air travel back and forth to South Africa and Australia is another option. The penny has finally dropped that players are not just embracing Europe for the money, but for a more varied and stimulating rugby diet.</p> <p>Tew, furthermore, believes it is not only New Zealand who should fret about the increasingly cosmopolitan nature of this year's Heineken Cup. The development of home-based players, he says - not to mention coaches - is being stifled by all the ex pats.</p> <p>\"You do wonder whether the real hurt will be felt by the unions whose competitions these guys are playing in. There are, for example, a very small number of French-qualified props in the French league. It won't be a surprise if the French scrum comes under pressure in the November internationals and the Six Nations. England have got a similar issue with the number of overseas players wearing the No10 jersey.\"</p> <p>The latest medical bulletins suggesting Jonny Wilkinson will not resume playing for five months following knee surgery - he will now struggle to feature in the Six Nations, reducing his chances of going on next summer's British and Irish Lions tour to South Africa - highlight that recurring headache.</p> <p>Either way, an understandable whiff of Kiwi jealousy and self-interest is discernible, made worse by the limited availability of leading All Black players for the domestic Air New Zealand Cup. Tew, however, says he is going in to bat for every sparsely populated rugby nation struggling to keep up with the big spenders.</p> <p>\"What has concerned us lately is what we consider to be the incredible amounts of money on offer to our players in the United Kingdom and particularly in France, where we think the player market is completely out of control.</p> <p>\"We've been saying to the IRB for some time that international rugby is under threat if the player market continues to grow without a parallel increase in revenue. What will probably come out of the current financial crisis facing the world will be a reality check.\"</p> <p>The implication is that, in rugby's case, that might not be such a bad thing. \"While there are obvious benefits for players there are pitfalls. Our view is that common sense needs to prevail and more reasonable market values should be paid for our players. They've got skills which they should be free to trade and we're incredibly aware that we live in a global market. But if we want Test rugby to be the pre-eminent product - which our players and everyone else tell us they do - then you've got to keep it intact.\"</p> <p>Even in New Zealand, though, they are now having to consider what has always been seen as the nuclear option: picking foreign-based players for the All Blacks. The pressure would be unbearable if Dan Carter's imminent move to Perpignan was for more than a six-month sojourn but, for now, the NZRU's fingers remain wedged in the dyke.</p> <p>\"Even if we were to pick our overseas-based players for the All Blacks it wouldn't be the same,\" said Tew. \"They wouldn't be available for the Tri-Nations, for example, because that falls outside the IRB international window. We'd be picking a worldwide All Black side in June and a home-based one in July and August. Our current thinking is that's a step too far.\"</p> <p>A further storm is brewing closer to home. This week the Queensland Reds signed the All Black flanker Daniel Braid from Auckland as the first overseas player to be recruited under the Australian Rugby Union's new \"foreign player policy\". With the former Crusaders coach Robbie Deans at the helm of the national team, there is a possibility that the Wallabies could lure several promising Kiwi youngsters across the Tasman. Such players could then become eligible for the green and gold via residency.</p> <p>\"It's an interesting development which we're watching closely and talking to the Australians about,\" said Tew, coldly. New Zealand's reputation as world rugby's conveyor belt is not in doubt, but the Kiwis are fed up with their rivals reaping all the benefits.</p> <h2>Foreign legion</h2> <p>How 14 All Blacks and a Maori make up a formidable Heineken Cup XV</p> <p>15 <strong>Ben Blair</strong> Cardiff Blues</p> <p>14 <strong>Doug Howlett</strong> Munster</p> <p>13 <strong>Luke McAlister</strong> Sale</p> <p>12 <strong>Aaron Mauger</strong> Leicester</p> <p>11 <strong>Regan King</strong> Scarlets</p> <p>10 <strong>Dan Carter</strong> Perpignan or</p> <p><strong>Nick Evans</strong> Harlequins</p> <p>9 <strong>Byron Kelleher</strong> Toulouse</p> <p>or <strong>Mark Robinson</strong> Wasps</p> <p>1 <strong>Greg Somerville</strong> Gloucester</p> <p>2 <strong>Tom Willis</strong> N-G Dragons</p> <p>3 <strong>Kees Meeuws</strong> Scarlets or</p> <p>4 <strong>Simon Maling</strong> Scarlets</p> <p>5 <strong>Paul Tito</strong> Cardiff Blues*</p> <p>6 <strong>Filo Tiatia</strong> Ospreys</p> <p>7 <strong>Marty Holah</strong> Ospreys</p> <p>8 <strong>Xavier Rush</strong> Cardiff Blues</p> <p>*Represented New Zealand Maori but not the All Blacks</p>",
  "<p>Confused and angry Icelanders were yesterday wondering why Britain appeared to be doing its best to push their country over the edge.</p> <p>A leading Icelandic economist has already warned that after a 10-year boom fuelled mainly by foreign debt, the exposed North Atlantic island probably was technically bankrupt and had few realistic options left other than to turn to the International Monetary Fund for help.</p> <p>But many Icelanders feel the British government in particular - which has used anti-terrorism legislation to freeze the assets of Icelandic banks in Britain, threatened court action to recover savers' deposits and described the actions of the Icelandic government as unacceptable and illegal - is making things a great deal worse.</p> <p>An analyst at Landsbanki, one of the three Icelandic banks nationalised this week, and who declined to be named, said: \"There's an anti-Iceland thing going on. But why? Why are you behaving like this? Is Gordon Brown happy to have a small, badly weakened scapegoat to distract attention? In any case, it's succeeded: Britain has destroyed whatever confidence there was left in Iceland.\"</p> <p>\"We don't understand,\" said Saeunn Kjartansdottir, a Reykjavik psychotherapist. \"In Iceland we have been told consistently that the Icelandic government has from the start of this crisis had every intention of paying their due to British savers. We have been told that our finance secretary said this very clearly to your chancellor. An then the very same day, Mr Darling appears on British televison and claims the opposite!\"</p> <p>The executive chairman of Kaupthing, Iceland's biggest bank, also accused Britain of being partly responsible for his bank's nationalisation on Thursday, saying it had stood a fair chance of weathering the storm until London's Financial Services Authority stepped in and sold its savings business, Kaupthing Edge, to a Dutch institution.</p> <p>Official reactions are more diplomatic. \"There seems to be a massive miscommunication here,\" said Finnur Oddsson of the Icelandic Chamber of Commerce. But even he professes to be confused by statements coming out of London. </p> <p>\"It is simply not true to say that Iceland has defaulted,\" he said. \"The Icelandic government has never said it will not pay. Certainly the message we are getting in Iceland is that these banks have been nationalised, that they have assets abroad and that those assets will be used pay off what British savers have in their accounts. And the government has said it will back all depositor guarantees.\"</p> <p>Icelanders readily admit that their banks, and a handful of young, aggressive entrepreneurs who bought up swaths of the British high street, have brought at least part of their present problems (and the country's) on themselves. \"The world was awash with cheap money,\" said Eggert Gudmundsson, CEO of the HB Grandi, the biggest fishing company, an industry that still accounts for half Iceland's exports.</p> <p>\"When things go well, the highly leveraged strategy these groups used is how you make the most money, the fastest. But it's also clear that when things go badly, that kind of high-risk approach means things can go very, very badly wrong. And it's fair to say that globally, things have gone just about as badly as they could.\"</p> <p>The past decade has been one of extravagance and excess for many in Iceland. \"It's been wild,\" said Hyvnir Fridfinnsson, the manager of b5, a smart bar-restaurant. \"One long party, really. We have groups of 100, 150 in here from banks and businesses, trying to outdo each other in how much champagne they buy.\"</p> <p>But Icelanders are surprised at some of their supposed allies. The prime minister, Geir Haarde, said the country had turned to Russia in search of a \u20ac4bn loan because EU partners had proved unwilling. Olafur Isleifsson, an economics lecturer, said there was disillusionment that America, too, which maintained a big military base on Iceland until very recently, had not volunteered.</p> <p>\"We need a little help from our friends,\" he said. \"Iceland will stay standing, but we are suffering perhaps more than anyone else in Europe from this, and we are a little disappointed by some of our allies.\"</p> <p>But besides the recklessness of some of its bankers and businessmen, Iceland is at the eye of the storm essentially because it, and the krona, are too small to sustain such a big financial system. A population of 300,000 people, operating in what Isleifsson calls \"the smallest currency known to man\", will always find life difficult in a tumultuous global market.</p> <p>For the Icelandic government, the krona's weakness means supporting its banks and their foreign debt is all but impossible. Nor can it hope to tackle soaring inflation and sky-high interest rates. In the long term, Iceland's future will lie in some kind of currency union or parity, and a return to its true assets: fish, and green, geo-thermal energy.</p> <p>\"I think,\" said Asbjorn Jonsson, a third-generation fisherman, \"that people have learned that money is not made in banks. It is made by real people working hard at real jobs. Actually, deep down we knew that all along. We just have to learn it again.\"</p>",
  "<p>China looks likely to emerge stronger in the weakened financial system after weathering its own crises of unrest in Tibet and the Sichuan earthquake this year.</p> <p>Most experts there predict that the relative isolation of the country's financial system, high savings rate and the internal strengths of the fast-growing economy will help keep it secure.</p> <p>But concerns remain about the shrinking of big overseas markets and the likely inflation of commodities. This is likely to hit Guangdong, Zhejiang and other coastal industrial hubs, which rely on exports to provide demand for their factories.</p> <p>Even before the crisis, China's economic growth is thought to have slowed from the red-hot pace of recent years. This was partly because of government credit-tightening measures to tackle inflation.</p> <p>But growth is still enviably rapid. In a report issued today, the country's top think</p> <p>tank, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, estimates the economy will grow 10.1% in 2008 and 9.5% in 2009.</p> <p>\"The financial crisis and the world economic slowdown will have an impact on us, but they won't change the fundamentals of the Chinese economy,\" Chen Jiagui, vice-head of the academy, said.</p> <p>Compared with last year's 11.9% growth rate, it is a slowdown. The authorities are trying to further stimulate domestic demand, which is seen as the best way to offset the loss of export business. This week, the People's Bank of China was quick to follow the coordinated move by six central banks in North America and Europe with a 0.27 percentage point reduction of interest rates.</p> <p>Despite the crunch overseas, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences says retail sales will increase by 19% and exports by 21% this year.</p> <p>Analysts are studying the opportunities for China to buy cheaply into strategically important foreign firms that were previously too expensive or too politically sensitive to consider. China's acquisition of such stakes has been accelerating in the past three years, according to the Boston Consulting Group, which noted five buyouts by Chinese banks worth more than $1bn since 2005.</p> <p>While the British bail-out has attracted some passing comment, editorials and commentators have looked towards Wall Street, many asking whether the US model of capitalism was finished, and what the implications would be for the rising power of China.</p> <p>The nationalist Global Times suggested Beijing should start short-selling its huge holdings of US treasury bonds to punish Washington for selling arms to Taiwan. While the government has shown no sign of making such a move - which would be tantamount to declaring financial war - the article received considerable support in debating forums.</p> <p>\"Financial liberalism has gone wild since the Thatcher cabinet and the Reagan administration set off a wave of 'neo-liberalism' in the 1980s,\" noted Liu Junhong, a researcher with China Institute of Contemporary International Relations, in a comment piece for the English-language newspaper China Daily.</p>",
  "<p>In early 1996, Peter Mandelson saw the future, and it worked. The man who returned to the cabinet last week with an instant peerage, a red V-neck sweater and a tricky past was present at the birth of New Labour as he is now present at its death. Every political age needs a book, and Mandelson delivered it almost 13 years ago in <em>The Blair Revolution</em>, serialised in this paper and immediately demolished by it in a review from Roy Hattersley. He complained of \"soft options, vague generalities and reassuring platitudes\". He was right about that, but missed something. The book is shallow, but it has lasted. This is a guide to stale Blairite hopes, as recooked by David Cameron.</p> <p>Open a copy, the cheap old binding snapping to spill pages from the pistachio-green covers (the colour of Labour's conference set the year Blair took over), and much is familiar. The language about community - \"Britain desperately needs to promote a flowering of voluntary initiative and civic pride\" - is pure Cameron gush. All Cameron's favourite words and phrases are present: family, responsibility, strong society and, most of all, change. Some of the policies are here too. Labour now attacks the Conservative fixation with marriage, but readers are told \"marriage itself can and should be strengthened directly by public policy\". Mandelson advocates \"a public dowry available just once in a lifetime\" (no divorce tolerated), which, with a salesman's guile, he suggests should be offered to voters as the \"Getting Off to a Good Start\" scheme. </p> <p>That never happened. But much in this book did. This is no political dreamland, where wild thoughts roam before being forgotten in the sensible daylight of government. It is a specific list for power - devolution, freedom of information, public investment and so on: the substance of Blair's administration before its leader ran off to Iraq with George Bush. It is written in the tone of a doctor talking a patient towards a necessary but awkward operation. It represses daring, substituting that for \"what works\" - or is supposed to work, since so many of its proposals stuttered and failed. Some of it reads ironically. \"Labour based its public spending plans on optimistic forecasts of economic growth that failed to materialise. Eventually taxes had to be raised which ... led to the alienation of Labour's better-off supporters,\" it warns - of 1979, and perhaps again today.</p> <p>The book is less the product of one man than a movement of which he was a leading member. Mandelson and his co-author, Roger Liddle (who presumably did the bulk of the writing), were part of a circle that also included Derek Draper, thanked fulsomely in the acknowledgments before his own Mandelsonian fall from grace and recent rebirth in Brown's kitchen cabinet. Its pages revive the sense of liberation that accompanied New Labour's election in 1997. There was something brilliant about the single-minded attempt to set social justice alongside economic strength, a modernisation that put the party in tune with the public. It was led by a politician with the best retail skills in the business, against a Conservative party that deserved to lose. </p> <p>In hindsight, the pettiness of New Labour can be detected too - the attacks on the media, which begin on page one of the preface; the boastfulness; and the denial of what is obviously true. \"Today, of course, the Labour leader is elected by one-member-one-vote,\" Mandelson and Liddle claim, when that was not the case then and is still not the case now. </p> <p>The strains that pulled at the New Labour government from its first hour are clear too: only two references to Gordon Brown in the index (though his ally Ed Balls makes the acknowledgments as a less blokeish Edward). There is hardly a mention of John Prescott, the deputy leader who hated Mandelson. Above all, Blair's 1994 election to the job Brown thought he deserved is skated over, given less than a page when the scrapping of Clause IV (much more on message) gets six. The closest the book comes to acknowledging that Granita moment is an arch reference to the fact that \"within hours, to an extent that took everyone, including him, by surprise, opinion in Westminster was talking of Blair as the most suitable successor\". It cannot have surprised Mandelson much, since he arranged it.</p> <p>Now we are supposed to believe that Mandelson and Brown are friends again, which is unlikely, although Mandelson's commitment to Labour is real. His pride in it wavers, though. One page boasts of a bedrock of values inherited from Keir Hardie and Clement Attlee; almost the next tells us that \"New Labour is, in Tony Blair's words, 'literally a new party'\".</p> <p>Reading the book now, with the knowledge of where it led, is to watch mice blunder around a maze in search of an exit. The omission of things that came to matter is telling, starting with foreign policy other than Europe. There is very little on the United States, then happily neutralised under Bill Clinton; nothing on Iraq, then back in its box, quelled by sanctions and the no-fly zone; nothing on Afghanistan, or Islam, or terrorism beyond Ireland. The book is ignorant of climate change (\"the earth has not hit the buffers, contrary to warnings more than two decades ago\"). Mobile phones are unmentioned luxuries, reserved for City traders, plumbers, rent boys and spin doctors. There is no text messaging and most of all no email or web, transforming forces that came about without being commanded by government. What, of that sort, awaits us now?</p> <p>Social forces, too, are overlooked. Gay people get only one mention (a reassurance that \"Blair is not a prude or a pig ... he is not judgmental about those friends who are not in conventional marriages\"). Yet Labour's achievements in the area of social liberalisation, from civil partnerships on, turned out to be some of the greatest of the government. Britain today is a more liberal and generous place because of Blair's government. But not in every area. Race and migration are not discussed as potential issues. The Britain the book describes is without Polish plumbers or Islamic radicals, let alone Starbucks macchiato grandes, overpaid foreign footballers, hedge funds, online poker or music downloads.</p> <p>Nor is there any warning of the dangers of a credit-fuelled boom, of the sort that has exploded over Britain this week. The text diagnoses Britain's problems in 1996, many of which remain problems today. But it does not offer much in the way of solutions. Optimism is the easy part. Again, in this it is a sort of prequel to Cameron, charged now by a government that has too many old policies of having no new ones of his own. The long empty moan of opposition is always with us.</p> <p>It is useful to be reminded of how light New Labour's policy baggage was in the mid-1990s - nothing substantial on the NHS; a bit on skills and jobs; a lot on Europe, most of which was made redundant by Brown's obstreperousness; some stuff on the constitution to keep the Scots and the Guardian happy; a warning to the trade unions to keep quiet. In place of substance, the authors wander off into an imaginary world of Peter's friends. This is the sort of place where politicians often feel happiest. Brown entered it in his conference speech a fortnight ago - meeting \"the dad who lives to walk his daughter up the aisle and the gran who is there to clap and cry at her grandson's graduation\". But Mandelson and Liddle got there first and the trick was as horrible then as it is now.</p> <p>A large part of the book involves a series of stereotypical characters, all of whom have been let down by Tory cruelty and are to be redeemed by Labour good sense. There is nothing threatening about these people. Like all loyal members of New Labourland they have hearts of gold, even naughty little Peter, the 14-year-old scamp let down by his local comp (the name surely a joke between the authors). Peter is poor, so is his mum (inevitably called Tracy) who \"got pregnant in her late teens ... married her boyfriend. But it didn't last.\" At least, under New Labour, they might have got Mandelson's dowry. Tracy's dad is dead (though the NHS did its best) and her mum Eileen is a hard-working school dinner lady who rarely sees her upwardly mobile son Derek (think Draper), a man who bought into the Thatcher dream as an electrician in Harlow ...</p> <p>But enough of these unfortunate people. Peter (the MP, not the truant kid) becomes bored of them too. He wants us to meet another couple, of the kind he might, in 1996, have joined on holiday, before he discovered the joys of associating with the seriously rich. Ben (the name of another Mandelson staffer) and Laura are terribly nice types, who live in a late Georgian house in Kennington and might even vote Labour, of the Blair rather than Foot variety. New Labour's offer to the fictional Ben and Laura is mainly to get rid of the guilt about being rich, without getting rid of their riches. </p> <p>Their kids, of course, have to go to private school (blame the Tories) and Ben has private medical care just in case. But they have the potential to be solid citizens of the progressive state. As things stand, their life is one horrible mass of middle-class anxieties: burglary, the hell of the Northern line and most of all \"the fearful example of a colleague's eldest son at a leading London day-school with one of the finest academic records in the country, but now gone off the rails, addicted to drugs and a drop-out\". What a waste of the fees, apart from anything else.</p> <p>There is a very Mandelson touch in the book's interest in Ben's furniture: \"the private domain of his working existence is a joy - the tasteful office with its comfortable sofas, designer lamps and expensive wallprints; the client entertainment; even the twice-weekly workout at the private gym\". The image of an earlier ministerial Mandelson, feet up in an Eames chair in that too-expensive Notting Hill house which cost him his first job, swims into view. </p> <p>One hopes that the office of the new business secretary will be equally well furnished. He was shocked in the 1990s by Blair's asceticism - \"Blair's friends know that he is not especially interested in creature comforts and how things look\". That, at least, has changed. The former prime minister is now the owner of a No 10 replica in London and a Chequers substitute in Bucks, Sir John Gielgud's old home. </p> <p>The authors soon move on to subjects closer to their heart, media management and the \"widespread culture of sleaze, which the modern brand of Conservatism has nurtured\". If the Tories gave birth to modern sleaze, we now know that New Labour educated it into adulthood. Put aside the seriousness or not of the two sins that brought down Mandelson, New Labour's boast of moral purity was one of the more foolish parts of its development. In 1996, the authors could argue primly that \"the idea that there is nothing objectionable about a public figure pursuing a dubious private commercial interest as long as it is declared is one of the most corrupting principles in private life today\". In 2008, plenty of Labour figures claim exactly this defence. </p> <p>What, though, about those unlucky citizens we met earlier? <em>The Blair Revolution</em> ends on a bizarre note. In sweeping italic type, their fate in the then distant year of 2005 is described. The Tories won, god forbid. Ben and Laura have had to flee London after their house was burnt down by a mob, enraged by \"the Portillo crackdown\". The army patrols the streets and \"trips to the theatre or their favourite restaurant have to be planned long in advance\". Peter, meanwhile, \"has been in and out of prison twice by now\", just as his namesake has been in and out of cabinet jobs. Eileen is shocked to see \"even posh parts of her neighbourhood going downhill\". \"How had it happened? Could it have been different?\"</p> <p>It could, of course, for the story of New Labour has a happy ending after all. The Tories didn't win. Peter becomes a garage-owning entrepreneur. Eileen's flat is done up. Ben's business is booming. \"Some great public-private deal has been done for the London Underground. Revamped and on time, the Northern line isn't a bad way to get about now.\" As the sun shines, our happy cast of characters gathers to cheer in the clean, safe streets. \"Ben hadn't been able to quite put his finger on it, but Laura had said it felt as if we had become a young country again.\"</p>",
  "<p>Sometimes the affinity of children and technology can be irritating. The tipping point for Sophie came when she asked five-year-old Maddy if she'd like to paint a picture and, instead of running for brushes, Maddy headed for the computer. In seconds she had the machine booted and the Microsoft Paint program rolling. It was later, when Maddy talked about saving her picture on a memory stick, that Sophie started planning an extreme simplicity, non-technological holiday.</p> <p>The place she came up with was Yuva, a vegetarian yoga retreat situated down a remote track on the Lycian coast of Turkey. As well as doing week-long taught yoga retreats suitable for couples and singles, Yuva also has weeks for anyone who needs peace and quiet, children included. The nearest shop is a half-hour drive away; the internet is unheard of. \"We'll get up every morning at six and do yoga,\" says Sophie, \"There'll be no computers, mobiles, or electronic gizmology, nothing like that - not even ice cream.\"</p> <p>This shocked Maddy to attention. Sophie continued waxing lyrical about this puritan fantasy. \"Just sun and sea and exercise and wholesome food.\"</p> <p>When we came to pack, I got the laptop ready. \"There's some work I've got to finish.\" Maddy winked and slipped a DVD in the case: her latest favourite, The Sound of Music. \"Don't tell Mummy.\" </p> <p>We arrived at night in Dalaman airport, southwest Turkey. Night lasers sliced up the sky above the tourist towns of Hisaronu and Olu Deniz, but then came darkness. The road went higher and lower, then higher again. The stars came out and we could sense rather than see, huge cliffs, forested gorges and craggy peaks all around. </p> <p>We descended slowly through a forest of black fir trees, lurching and bouncing until we reached a hand-painted gateway which led us to a cool stone cabin with veranda. There we slept.</p> <p>Rising at nine, not six, we explored the 400-acre site with Nihat, assistant manager at Yuva and old friend of Atilla Sevilmis, the owner. Nihat had first walked the precipitous Lycian coastline three decades ago, a time when there was only a narrow footpath along the 10-mile section between Olu Deniz and Yuva. Changes such as the new road, however, do not seem to unduly depress his enthusiasm.</p> <p>\"Once you get beyond Olu Deniz, it's still a beautiful quiet wooded coast with Lycian tombs in the undergrowth and a few beekeepers.\"</p> <p>The Yuva site is certainly quiet. </p> <p>A few cabins and cottages built by hand with local timber and stone are dotted among the trees on a steep hillside. Vines curl around eaves laden with tiny sweet grapes. Maddy browses. It is 10am and there have been no DVD or ice cream demands. Sophie is smiling. Nihat takes us down to the eating area with its large open vegetarian kitchen full of smiling Turkish matrons who sweep Maddy into their welcoming bosoms and start feeding her by hand. Sadly adults do not get quite the same level of service, but we tuck into local produce galore: olives, cucumbers, yoghurt, fat tomatoes, walnuts, almonds, peaches, and various local specialities - the poppy seed paste was delicious, so was Atilla's concoction of mulberry jelly and tahini. The bazlama spelt bread is warm from the oven. </p> <p>Afterwards I snooze in a hammock in an elevated gazebo that is stocked with cushions and books. Maddy curls up with Mehmish, the tabby cat, under the kitchen table while the matrons start work on a walnut and honey sponge cake. No one has asked me to do any yoga. I'm in heaven.</p> <p>Atilla Sevilmis is something of a pioneer in Turkey. Starting out as an economist in Istanbul, he initiated the first attempts to link village farmers and city consumers, part of his belief that food production should be small-scale, local and organic. Ten years ago he extended that philosophy to tourism, building the Yuva retreat in the same spirit. </p> <p>\"We take a maximum of 20 guests. We make very little impact on this environment: the wild pigs still come and eat the carob seeds at night, the tortoises are everywhere. We live in the forest.\" </p> <p>Quiet is the operative word. That first day the noisiest thing I encountered was next to the shady yoga platform: two tortoises making mad passionate love.</p> <p>As the sun lost its heat, Nihat showed us around the swimming options: a sheltered cove, a more rocky outcrop and a second cove with a smattering of shingle. Smaller children would find all these options too challenging, but Maddy was fine despite being a weak swimmer. In fact we could not get her out of the second cove until sunset, finally dragging her back to the kitchen for a feast of home-made pasta and stuffed peppers. Wine and beer, I discovered, were available, reminding me of my first visit to Turkey when an imam in a mosque assured me that wine and beer, \"were not strong enough to be called alcoholic.\"</p> <p>Soon enough we had entered that heady lotus-eater routine of sleep, swim, eat - one we repeated around three or four times a day. The laptop stayed in its case. We forgot where our money was since there was nothing to buy, nor any reminders of that world - Yuva is a wonderfully economical place to be. I even started a few yoga stretches, usually in the afternoon when the tortoises took a break from their love-making.</p> <p>After a few days Atilla took us to see the farmers' market in Fethiye, over 200 stalls selling the best of Lycia's food: honeycombs, tiny sweet cherries and various types of fig. We snacked on borek, spinach and cheese fried in flat bread, then had a late lunch in a restaurant at nearby Yakakoy, where tables are set up above tumbling streams of spring water under the shade of ancient chestnut trees. Finally on the way home, and at my insistence, we stopped in Olu Deniz.</p> <p>In many ways the lagoon at Olu Deniz has been a barometer for the Turkish tourist industry. Thirty years ago the place was empty: a long coarse sand beach protecting a placid lagoon and surrounded by wooded mountains. Now it's a low-rise town of medium-size hotels, restaurants, bars and shops. By the standards of such places it is not at all bad, but there is no escape from the commercialisation of relaxation. On the beach sunloungers are packed in ranks with warning signs, \"Do not sit between the loungers!\" \"Sunloungers are for rent!\" and even \"Warning: Slippery when wet!\"</p> <p>To reach the prime spot, the finger of double-sided beach that stretches between sea and lagoon, one passes through a turnstile and pays an entry fee of \u00a31.50. Security guards patrol and warning signs remind visitors that this is \"a protected natural place\". One local lady, trying to dry her daughter's tiny swimming costume on a tree branch was assailed by two burly guards and told to remove it. \"This is a nature park,\" they reminded her and stalked back to their cabin next to the ice cream stall.</p> <p> After this our return to Yuva felt like a home-coming. We swam in the deserted cove, ate dinner together, then Nihat played his flute, the Turkish ney, while Atilla sang a traditional Turkish lament. </p> <p>\"I am on a long and narrow way, I'm walking night and day. </p> <p>I don't know how I fare, I'm walking night and day.\"</p> <p>On our leaving, we packed our bags sadly. Maddy glanced at my laptop case but said nothing, Julie Andrews was silent and forgotten in the side pocket. Yuva, however, will not be so easily forgotten and this remarkable experiment in responsible tourism deserves every bit of its quiet success. </p> <p>\u2022 Thomas Cook (<a href=\"http://www.flythomascook.com\">flythomascook.com</a>)flies Gatwick-Dalaman from \u00a3120pp rtn.

  "<p>Sir Alan Sugar placed a surprise bet on the future of Woolworths yesterday by acquiring a near-4% stake in the struggling retailer.</p> <p>The star of The Apprentice television show also appears to be banking on the health of the British high street as the economy teeters on the brink of recession. However, analysts said the deal may indicate greater interest in Woolworths' sizeable property portfolio of 800 stores.</p> <p>Shares in Woolworths rose 29% to 4.06p on the news, which offered some reassurance to investors who lost their dividend last month after the group posted a half-year loss of \u00a3100m. It is not known whether Sugar, whose \"you're fired\" catchphrase is known to millions of BBC viewers, has radical plans for the ailing business. Woolworths declined to comment on the purchase of the stake.</p> <p>Despite a recent change of chief executive, problems are mounting for one of the British high street's oldest names. This week the group lost its credit insurance, which protects suppliers, from the three biggest specialist insurers. </p> <p>Woolworths was forced to reassure investors that it was comfortable with its financial position and trading normally, but the business has struggled ever since it was demerged from Kingfisher seven years ago. Steve Johnson, who took over as chief executive last month, has warned that the business does not put customers first and has lost focus - underlined by the fact that it sells 54 different types of pencil case but does not sell women's tights.</p> <p>There was speculation last night that Sugar sees potential in the group's property assets. It has no freehold properties but some of the leaseholds could be attractive to Sugar's Amsprop property company, which became a 3.88% shareholder in the retailer by acquiring a stake worth about \u00a31.8m yesterday. The potential value of the property was highlighted this year when Woolworths sold four leasehold properties to Waitrose for \u00a325m. </p> <p>Woolworths also announced plans to sell leases on nine of its stores to Tesco for up to \u00a39m yesterday. It will use the cash to reduce debt, which stood at \u00a3295m at the half-year. </p> <p>The group came to the UK in 1909, opening its first store in Liverpool, but it has suffered in the modern retail environment, squeezed on one side by supermarkets and by online retailers on the other.</p> <p>Sugar sold his Amstrad firm, which makes set-top TV boxes, to BSkyB last year. The businessman was unavailable for comment on the move, which follows a precipitous decline in the retailer's shares. The company has lost 80% of its value in the past year, leaving it with a market capitalisation of just under \u00a346m. </p> <p>In August the group rejected an approach from a consortium fronted by the multimillionaire Malcolm Walker, founder of the Iceland supermarket chain, which valued the business at \u00a350m. Woolworths rejected the price as too low.</p> <p>Woolworths is hoping to fight off bidders with the outcome of a strategic review and consultants believe it could build a sustainable business based on its small and medium-sized stores.</p>",
  "<p>As the leaves on the trees around River Cottage are swapping the deep, dusty green of late summer for the golden shades of autumn, the pumpkin patch is limbering up for Halloween and the fruit and veg garden is surprisingly productive. Roots and greens and even late, podable beans abound, and of course there'll be apples and pears until well into next year. In the polytunnel, the tomatoes are having their last hurrah, but the peppers and chillies are going well, as are, joy of joys, my aubergines.</p> <p>After the crisp, clean salads of summer, the new season asks for warming, intense flavours, and one of the best ways to enhance this rich, burnished autumn harvest is by turning to the spice rack. I believe in ginger, cumin and coriander, caraway, star anise and paprika, both sweet and smoked... It's a creed of warmth and comfort from the inside out. In Ayurvedic medicine, herbs and spices are used to create an internal heat that is said to promote health and ward off illness. Whether or not that's true, at this time of year I'll take all the support I can get. </p> <p>Instead of the fresh leaves of coriander, I'm now more likely to use seeds, toasted to bring out their citrusy, slightly sage-y flavour. I often use them in simple combination with cumin - its pungent, almost floral aroma makes the perfect flavour companion for coriander. Ground together, I use them to dust roast roots - parsnips, carrots, celeriac - to serve with the Sunday roast. Sometimes a hint of chilli goes in, too, as with the aubergine recipe, below. When you're making up a spice mix such as this from scratch, always make a fair bit more than you need, then use it to experiment with in the days that follow. It will keep, sealed in a jar, for a week or two.</p> <p>Taking things to the next level is the lovely Arabic \"dry dressing\" dukka, a highly customisable blend of spices, seeds and nuts. I make no apologies for citing it for the second time in three weeks. Like a favourite autumn sweater, when it's working for you, it's nice to give it a good run. In both cases, what goes underneath can vary considerably, according to my mood, and to the weather.</p> <h2>Baked aubergines with walnuts</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338481708\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2008/10/10/hugh4.jpg\" alt=\"Baked augbergines with walnuts\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Baked augbergines with walnuts.

Sprinkle with salt, leave to drain for 30 minutes, then wash under the cold tap and pat dry. You can cook them on a griddle pan or in the oven. If baking, preheat to 240C/475F/gas mark 9. Put a metal cooling rack on a baking sheet and put in the oven to heat up.</p> <p>In a small pan, toast the cumin and coriander seeds over medium-high heat for a minute or so until they release their fragrance. Tip into a mortar or spice grinder, add the chilli and pound until fine. Brush the aubergine slices with oil and dust with half the spice mixture. If using a griddle pan, place over a high heat until very hot, then cook the slices for four minutes a side. If you're baking them, remove the hot rack, brush with oil and place the slices on the rack. Cook, turning once, for 12 to 15 minutes.</p> <p>While the aubergine is cooking, whisk the remaining spice mix with the yogurt, garlic and a good pinch of salt.

  "<p>The astonishing boldness of the government's attempt to get credit flows moving again has rightly received high praise. But there is a danger that the moral of the whole affair will be misunderstood. Before he unveiled the \u00a3500bn package, Alistair Darling was often criticised for his blandness. Surely he should have known that confidence was leaking out of the global financial system well before panic accelerated? Surely he should have displayed more grip, more foresight? </p> <p>What no one seemed to realise is that he was in good company. The national government of 1931 was formed to save the pound; and all good men and true assumed that it would do so. Yet a month after its formation, sterling left the gold standard after all, and proceeded to float down to unheard of levels. After the Wall Street crash of 1929, US bankers and political leaders insisted again and again that the worst was over - only for each new display of optimism to precipitate further stock market falls.</p> <p>In the summer of 1949 Stafford Cripps, the Labour chancellor, repeatedly declared that sterling would not be devalued. When devaluation came in the autumn he was savagely attacked by the Conservatives for misleading the nation. It was the same story in 1967. Harold Wilson had set his face against devaluation when he formed his government in October 1964, despite a rapidly deteriorating payments balance, for which devaluation was the obvious remedy. From then until November 1967, when devaluation eventually took place, he, too, repeatedly insisted that nothing of the sort would happen and banned the very mention of devaluation from Whitehall. </p> <p>In 1976 the Callaghan government insisted that all was well, until a long-predicted sterling crisis forced it to seek a massive credit injection from the IMF. In 1992, John Major denounced what he called \"the soft option, the devaluers' option\", only to preside over Britain's departure from the ERM, and an effective sterling devaluation of 15%.</p> <p>For free-market fundamentalists, the moral is plain: governments and central banks cannot \"buck the market\". Politicians should keep their sticky hands out of the economy and give free rein to market forces. The results will often be untidy, and sometimes painful. But that is the price of what Friedrich von Hayek, the high priest of the unfettered market economy, called \"the Great Society\". Well-meant state intervention is a snare and a delusion, which is bound, sooner or later, to open \"the road to serfdom\".</p> <p>I doubt we shall hear much from that camp in the near future. It is obvious that the current financial crisis is the result of too little public intervention, not of too much. But the free-marketeers are not the only fundamentalists around. The populist left, now beginning to poke its head above the parapet, is equally fundamentalist, but in the opposite sense. For it, markets are nasty at best and wicked at worst. Bankers are evil, and ought to be punished, not rescued. Ordinary people who live beyond their means, put their money into dodgy institutions and take out mortgages they can't afford, are blameless. They have been manipulated by an inherently wicked financial services industry. Globalisation, the true author of the financial crisis, is evil too. We should put a stop to it, or at least slow it down. </p> <p>It is not fashionable to say so at the moment, but that makes it all the more important to remind ourselves that globalisation has made it possible for the governments of India and China to lift millions out of the most appalling poverty - and that, as Churchill said of democracy, the capitalist market economy is the worst economic system ever invented, apart from all the others. </p> <p>In truth, the fundamentalisms of right and left mirror each other. One says, \"markets good, states bad\". The other says, \"states good, markets bad\". The truth is that they are both good and bad - at the same time. What the present conjuncture shows most obviously is that unregulated markets sooner or later destroy the ethical and institutional foundations on which market economies rest. When times are good, greed and credulity drive out prudence and common sense, not just in the City, but on every high street. When they turn bad, as they always do sooner or later, fear drives out hope. Ebbing confidence feeds on itself. </p> <p>The truth is that market actors - which include you and me, as well as the faceless speculators of current demonology - are not the ice-cold rational calculators that classical economics assumes them to be. They are irrational, prone to panic and to behave more optimistically than they should. Nor, however, are they the helpless raw material for would-be social engineers. </p> <p>The need now is for clever regulation, on a global scale. In the EU, there is an equal need for much stronger political institutions to complement the central bank. But the greatest need of all is for a new theory of the mixed economy, framed for the global marketplace of today, as the now-defunct Keynesian system was framed for the national post-war economies. In the early 90s, economists like John Kay and Will Hutton were groping their way towards such a theory, but when New Labour won its crushing victory their work was buried. It's time to return to the charge. </p> <p>\u2022 David Marquand is the author of Britain Since 1918 <a href=\"http://mailto:david.marquand@mansfield.ox.ac.uk\">david.marquand@mansfield.ox.ac.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>As the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/marketturmoil\">market madness</a> broadens into full-blown recession across Europe, Jose Manuel Barroso is damned if he does and damned if he doesn't. The grumbling in Brussels is getting louder. The complaint is that \"Europe\" \u2013 in the shape of the European commission and its chief, Barroso \u2013 is asleep at the wheel.</p> <p>Barroso, whose overriding political aim is to secure another five years at the wheel next year, is <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/reuters/feeds/reuters/2008/10/09/2008-10-09T171921Z_01_L995679_RTRIDST_0_FINANCIAL-EU-SUPERVISION-UPDATE-2.html\">furious</a> about the criticism. \"The commission was asked by substantial actors not to do more on the financial and political system in Europe,\" he says. \"I don't think it's useful for the commission to enter into a conflict with [national] authorities when the chances of acceptance are zero.\"</p> <p>His hands are tied. Picking a fight with any of the big EU states could damage his chances of another term next year. The message is clear \u2013 in a major crisis, national interests trump the common European imperative every time. The British, the Germans or the French are not about to take orders from Brussels on a meltdown on this scale moving at this speed.</p> <p>The big countries \u2013 Germany, France, the UK and Italy \u2013 got together in Paris last weekend for an emergency summit. They called it European. The smaller EU states were angry at being excluded.</p> <p>But even the small countries are scrapping. When Benelux, the core of the EU, is mired in mutual recrimination, you know trouble is brewing. This is precisely what happened when Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg tried to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/06/europeanbanks.europe\">tackle</a> the collapse of the Fortis bank.</p> <p>The Dutch abandoned a tripartite bail-out, nationalised the best bits of Fortis and left the Belgians high and dry, praying for a French rescue. The Belgian and Dutch governments have been trading barbs ever since.</p> <p>Bigwigs in Brussels are dubbing this week the economic and financial equivalent of 9/11 \u2013 world-shattering, system-changing, things will never be the same again. As well as financial and economic, there will be political hell to pay. Barroso and other strategic thinkers like Mario Monti, Italy's former European commissioner, or Peter Mandelson are warning about a new protectionism and the \"renationalisation\" of policy-making in Europe.</p> <p>That's already happening in various fields related or unrelated to the economic crisis. To retain its credibility, the EU has to agree the fine print of its ambitious <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climatechange\">climate change</a> package by December.</p> <p>But national special pleading is rife. Disputes are raging behind the scenes. The German government is resolved to protect its car industry, the Poles are dependent on dirty coal, the British are incapable of committing to their mooted renewable energy obligations, and everyone has gone off biofuels since the policy aims were unveiled last year. The headline aims of the package will no doubt remain. But the means to that end are being shredded.</p> <p>National governments are now much more defensive on climate change, says Barroso, who fears that the package <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/oct/09/energy.climatechange\">could be a big casualty</a> of the financial chaos.</p> <p>Then there's Russia, gas supplies and energy security, where attempts to fashion a common European position are being constantly undermined by the conflicting national interests of, say, Germany and Poland, to name but two.</p> <p>There is no appetite among the likes of Germany, France or Italy for another confrontation with Russia in the wake of the Georgia war, says a senior European official. So, for example, when decisions are being taken next month about how to reconfigure the international role and presence in Bosnia, the big Europeans (though not Britain) will effectively side with Russia against a US that is otherwise engaged.</p> <p>More diffusely, the political fallout from the market mayhem is to wreck public confidence in the governing, managerial and business elites, triggering a popular insurgency against incumbency, a kick-the-buggers-out mood.</p> <p>\"Eurosceptics are going to rise very forcibly in the next European elections\" next June, predicts Michael Connarty, the chair of the Commons EU scrutiny committee. \"There is a massive undertow of resentment.\"</p> <p>It is getting harder and harder to govern properly across large swathes of Europe.

  "<p>Recent work by leading economists suggests that a new consensus is emerging on free trade agreements. Gone is the doctrine of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Consensus\">Washington consensus</a> which preached signing trade deals with any nation that is willing. A narrow but significant accord is emerging that says smaller regional and bilateral trade agreements are bad for the world economy. Perhaps then, Senator Barack Obama's <a href=\"http://www.barackobama.com/issues/economy/\">call</a> to rethink deals like Nafta is not so protectionist but really in line with <a href=\"http://www.cfr.org/publication/15653/obamas_freetrade_credentials_top_clintons.html\">contemporary economic thinking</a>. </p> <p>One of the world's most well-known trade economists is <a href=\"http://www.columbia.edu/~jb38/\">Jagdish Bhagwati</a> of Columbia University. In the early part of his career he spawned technical innovations to trade theory that are taught in any serious textbook of international economics. In recent decades he has served as free trade's champion in accessible books and short articles.</p> <p>His recent book, <a href=\"http://www.cfr.org/publication/15840/\">Termites of the Trading System: How Preferential Agreements Undermine Free Trade</a>, came as a shock to those who count him as an academic ally in the campaign for free trade. Bhagwati argues that trade deals like Nafta or the pending <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/03/20080312-3.html\">US-Colombia Free Trade Agreement</a> are \"termites\" that are eroding the world trading system and world economy.</p> <p>Why are these deals so bad? Bhagwati shows that they divert trade away from those nations with a true <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/research/economics/alphabetic.cfm?term=comparativeadvantage#comparativeadvantage\">comparative advantage</a>. Such advantages occur when every nation produces and exports from those sectors where their mix of land, labor and capital is most abundant. Liberalising tariffs and other barriers then means producers get access to more markets, and consumers have better choices and lower prices. </p> <p>In this scenario all nations benefit because they produce where they have a comparative advantage. Throw in these small trade deals and all of a sudden we are buying shirts from countries like Honduras rather than from China and Mexico where they can be produced more efficiently and come at a lower price. The crux of Bhagwati's argument is that foregoing those lower prices costs us in terms of \"trade diversion\". Indeed, the World Bank's 2005 Global Economic Prospects puts the price of trade diversion due to deals like Nafta between $115bn and $150bn on an annual basis. </p> <p>Another of the more eminent global trade and development economists is <a href=\"http://ksghome.harvard.edu/~drodrik/\">Dani Rodrik</a> of Harvard University. Rodrik and Bhagwati often disagree, but Rodrik's new book: <a href=\"http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8494.html\">One Economy, Many Recipes: Globalisation, Institutions, and Economic Growth</a>, also argues that many trade agreements are out of whack with economic theory - albeit from a different vantage point.</p> <p>According to Rodrik, many nations are stuck with a comparative advantage today that will keep them in poverty for a long time. Nations that grow the most over time exhibit a diversity of products for export and production. However, market failures make it difficult for poorer countries to diversify their economies and gain dynamic comparative advantage. Government policy is needed to help spur the diversification process. Many trade deals choke the ability of nations to deploy the proper policies for long-run development. </p> <p>Developing countries often look at the example of the US and European economies, and more recently, the economies of South Korea and China. Such nations moved into the global marketplace slowly and strategically, protecting their major exporting industries in order to nurture them into world markets. Rodrik shows that nations have trouble doing this under the WTO and an even harder time under deals like Nafta. </p> <p>If economists say these agreements are so bad, why do so many countries sign them? Indeed, most Latin American countries line up to sign trade agreements with the US. A new book, <a href=\"http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/pressAndInformationOffice/publications/books/2008/PoliticalEconomyofHemisphericIntegration.htm\">The Political Economy of Hemispheric Integration: Responding to Globalisation in the Americas</a>, edited by Diego Sanchez Ancochea of Oxford University and Kenneth Shadlen of the London School of Economics, argues that rich countries have the market power to bully Latin Americans into the deals by aligning themselves with Latin American elites and the sectors that receive the short term benefits. It's the politics, stupid.</p> <p>Senator Obama has said that when he is president he will rethink these agreements and make multilateralism the cornerstone of his foreign policy. Senator McCain has <a href=\"http://www.johnmccain.com/Issues/JobsforAmerica/trade.htm\">pledged</a> to follow the Bush administration's fundamentalist fervor for free trade agreements, however small or irrelevant, and is out of touch with contemporary economic thinking.</p> <p>Judging by these recent books from opposing sides of the trade debate, Senator Obama seems to have the economics right.</p>",

  "<p>A crisis meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors from the west's seven leading economies is considering joint action to bail out banks amid fears that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/interactive/2008/oct/10/creditcrunch-recession\">a fresh wave of panic</a> had pushed the global financial system to the brink of collapse.</p> <p>Chancellor Alistair Darling was urging his G7 colleagues to adopt Britain's blueprint of using taxpayers' money to buy stakes in tottering banks and warned the time for talking was over.</p> <p>With shares, oil and sterling all plunging at the end of a dramatic week, Darling said: \"Governments must act. They must demonstrate to the world that they are prepared to act together to do whatever it takes to stabilise the situation.\"</p> <p>The G7, which is meeting in Washington, was galvanised into action today by a nerve-shredding month on the financial markets, which they believe has taken the global financial system to the brink of a catastrophic collapse. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/10/marketturmoil-creditcrunch\">The FTSE </a>closed down 8.9% today, slipping below the 4,000 mark for the first time in five years.

Across Europe, every major market saw at least a fifth wiped off its value during the week.</p> <p>In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average plummeted by more than 700 points at the opening bell and then gyrated wildly in frenetic trading. It had already lost more than 40% of its value since its peak last year.</p> <p>Shares of embattled UK banks Royal Bank of Scotland and HBOS were among the hardest hit, with RBS falling 25% and HBOS 19%. It emerged that the government may be forced to take a stake of up to 50% in RBS after its market capitalisation was reduced to \u00a312bn tonight.</p> <p>With little sign that country-by-country plans to prop up failing banks have helped to kick-start stalled lending, the G7 believes immediate action is vital to avoid the paralysis in credit markets triggering a slump. The past four weeks have seen the biggest cut in forecasts for global growth in living memory, and the International Monetary Fund has warned that the world economy is \"on the cusp\" of recession.</p> <p>Darling said the annual meeting of the IMF and the G7 talks presented policymakers with \"a real challenge\". He added: \"if international cooperation is to mean anything, it means governments have to move on from simply agreeing a general approach and doing something to resolve the problems we are facing today. This is a period of severe turbulence. We haven't seen anything like this for generations.\"</p> <p>The chancellor hinted the government would exact a price from those bank chiefs deemed responsible for creating the crisis in the UK. Asked what the taxpayer could expect in return for bailing out the banks, Darling said: \"They won't accept people taking large risks that have had hugely damaging effects, not just on individual institutions, but on the wider economic system. Agreements will be negotiated.\"</p> <p>Also in Washington, the Bank of England governor, Mervyn King, said: \"Central banks will work together as we demonstrated this week to ensure sufficient short-term liquidity is provided to stabilise banking systems. But it is also vital that governments work together to ensure their banking systems are recapitalised to enable them to lend to finance spending in the real economy.\"</p> <p>So violent was the sell-off that several countries, including Russia and Indonesia, were forced to suspend their stock markets during the week to stave off financial collapse.</p> <p>The Italian prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, mooted the idea that stock markets throughout the world could be closed for up to a fortnight while governments work out a plan to restore calm and confidence to the financial system.</p> <p>Foreign exchange markets were also hit by the mood of panic.

They have got to take responsibility for this situation,\" said Brown. The intensification of the crisis has forced the US government to reconsider whether the $700bn plan to buy Wall Street's \"toxic waste\" will now be enough to halt the most severe stockmarket crash since 1929. US officials are working on their own version of Britain's bailout.

These funds are usually viewed as almost as risk-free as bank accounts but have dabbled catastrophically in the frozen debt markets.</p> <p>The IMF managing director, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, has made clear that he believes recapitalisation of the banking system, along British lines, must be part of any international solution.</p>",
  "<p>A <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/oct/08/einstein.letters.auction\">collection of letters</a> penned by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/alberteinstein\">Albert Einstein</a> in which he set out his views on how to deal with a belligerent post-war Russia and dismissed as \"twaddle\" the notion that his theories were difficult to understand, will go under the hammer in London next Thursday.</p> <p>The sale will be watched carefully because a letter in which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/may/12/peopleinscience.religion\">he branded religious beliefs as \"childish superstitions\"</a> and the \"product of human weaknesses\" that went on sale in May smashed the record for an Einstein letter by fetching \u00a3170,000. </p> <p>The evolutionary biologist, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/may/16/peopleinscience.controversiesinscience\">Prof Richard Dawkins, tried to buy that letter</a> for his foundation, but was comprehensively out-bid by a US buyer.</p> <p>Einstein's advice on the dilemma of how to deal with the USSR will strike a chord with modern-day western governments groping for an effective response to Russia's invasion of its neighbour Georgia. </p> <p>Einstein's correspondent, the psychoanalyst Walter Marseille, had promoted the idea of a world government in a paper entitled \"A Method to Enforce World Peace\" that he sent to Einstein and the philosopher Bertrand Russell. </p> <p>In correspondence to Marseille in 1948, Einstein wrote, \"Better to let Russia see that there is nothing to be achieved by aggression, but there are advantages in joining [a world government]: Then the Russian regime's attitude will probably change and they will take part without compulsion.\" </p> <p>In a later missive in the series, Einstein again advocated a diplomatic approach. \"The attitude of the Russians, it seems to me, clearly shows that they are deeply concerned about the military-industrial situation, and that they would be prepared to make considerable concessions if some degree of relaxation was permitted.\" </p> <p>In a third letter he wrote: \"In my view it is much better, both morally and practically, to attempt to bring about a state of affairs in which the Russians, out of pure self-interest, find it preferable to give up their separatist position.\"</p> <p>Simon Luterbacher, who is handling the sale for <a href=\"http://www.bloomsburyauctions.com/index\">Bloomsbury Auctions</a> said the <a href=\"http://www.bloomsburyauctions.com/detail/664/84.0\">four letters to Marseille</a> offered a great insight into Einstein's views on world affairs. </p> <p>\"I think that Einstein was much more open to the suggestion that you can make a deal or you can learn to live with what was the USSR,\" he said.</p> <p>Towards the end of his life, Einstein found his opinions being sought on many issues aside from physics - he was even offered, but turned down the job as Israel's first president. But Luterbacher said the letters to Marseille were not grandstanding by the great physicist. </p> <p>\"He viewed them as private correspondence,\" he said \"They were not for global publicity so he's just expressing his opinions. And of course he's a very clever man so he goes into a great amount of detail.\"</p> <p>In a separate lot is a <a href=\"http://www.bloomsburyauctions.com/detail/664/83.0\">hand-written letter to Adrien Wils</a>, a member of the public who had written to the great scientist to criticise his theory of relativity. </p> <p>\"Einstein must have had a massive correspondence, but I think he did make an effort to respond to as many as he could. He did spend a lot of effort and he even wrote back to children,\" said Prof Harvey Brown, a philosopher of physics and Einstein biographer. \"I think he had a sense of civic responsibility.\"</p> <p>In the letter, which has never been up for public sale before, Einstein appears to be countering the suggestion that his theory can be equated with moral relativism, or the idea that \"everything is relative\". </p> <p>\"Unfortunately, I cannot recommend your manuscript for printing, because it doesn't reflect the essentials of the theory,\" wrote the great physicist. \"This topic has nothing to do with the superficial statement that 'everything is relative' ... This is, by the way, not a philosophical theory, but purely physical.\" </p> <p>He also chides journalists for failing to understand one of his greatest scientific achievements. \"The twaddle that the theory is extremely difficult to understand, is complete nonsense, spread out by superficial journalists.\"</p> <p>\"He must have been frustrated at times,\" said Brown. \"[Special] relativity is much more of a target for criticisms from non-physicists of this kind. I think it is because it is just more mathematically accessible.\"</p> <p>Luterbacher expects the Wils letter to go for between \u00a36,000 and \u00a38,000 and the four typed letters to Marseille to fetch up to \u00a36,000. However, the auction house was well off the mark with its prediction for the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/may/13/peopleinscience.religion\">letter on religion</a> to philosopher Eric Gutkind, which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/may/15/peopleinscience.controversiesinscience\">sold for more than 20 times its guide price</a>. </p> <p>Luterbacher said predicting a value was an inexact science because all it took was two wealthy and determined bidders to boost the price. </p> <p>In 2007, a set of 13 Einstein letters and three holograph postcards were sold for $60,000; the same year a letter on world government went for $9,000; and in June that year a postcard and letter sold for \u00a3950; in 2006 a six-page scientific essay plus a letter fetched \u00a3300,000.</p> <p>Luterbacher said he did not think the depressed economic climate would affect the sale price. \"To be honest sales have been very buoyant recently.\" He said collectors were prepared to push the boat out for \"one-off opportunities\". </p> <p>\"You've got to go for it if you want it,\" he said</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/oct/08/einstein.letters.auction\"><em>Read edited extracts from the letters.</em></a></p>",
  "<p>In these <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business\">tumultuous times</a>, it is essential that we spend some time reflecting on why the global economy is in crisis. Without reflection, a blame game develops that can only lead to bad judgment, the wrong response, and an endless cycle of repeating our mistakes.</p> <p>What is generally agreed is that at the core of the problem is a banking system in which bankers were incentivised on the amount of credit they extended, rather than on any judgment of the quality of the loans they were creating. But the problem does not begin with greed, and the solution is not a lecture on morality. Instead solutions have to begin with a recognition that our current regulatory system was devised in the 1980s for entirely ideological reasons.</p> <p>In the UK, we have used a variety of methods to limit the amount of money that banks can create. In the 19th century, we used gold, and for most of the post-war period until the 1970s there were direct controls on lending. Increasingly, in the face of offshore and globalised money markets, these methods became less effective, but rather than adjusting the control mechanisms we chose instead to abandon all control.</p> <p>From 1979 to 1986, we persistently and continuously deregulated the financial sector. There were to be no reserve requirements, no limits over the use of wholesale markets, and no differentiation between a building society and a bank. Credit which had previously been rationed was to be freed. If an individual wanted to borrow money, then there was to be no limit over what they could borrow, especially and most importantly, because the new Britain was to be a property-owning democracy. This was the way to solve all the economic problems of the 1970s. Ownership would make us all more enterprising.</p> <p>Not surprisingly, this led to a huge expansion of the money supply, and a credit-fuelled property boom that caused the recession of the early 1990s. At the time the Bank of England, in its quarterly publications, made it very clear that they understood that ending credit rationing had created an inflationary boom. Nigel Lawson's <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/speeches/2000/speech82.htm\">mea culpa</a> in his 1992 memoirs attests to his understanding of the dangers of a free-for-all in money.</p> <p>But for some reason, these experiences were soon forgotten. Inflation targeting, which first began in 1993, was cemented by Gordon Brown's <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetarypolicy/framework.htm\">2% target</a> focused only on a small basket of consumer items. As such, it immediately opened up the possibility for the Bank of England to claim for itself great success while totally ignoring the huge increases in money supply in this country that were fuelling a housing price inflationary boom. Inflation targeting showed absolutely no regard to the real issue: the banking sector's ability to create as much credit-money as it liked.</p> <p>The 2% target was a nonsense from the start. We can hardly blame the high street banks when the Bank of England claimed it was doing such a good job, knowing full well from experience what happens when credit is over-extended. Instead, it relied for its prestige on hitting a target that has proved entirely ineffective in maintaining economic stability.</p> <p>New Labour had chosen to continue Thatcherism's work. It also believed that encouraging home ownership was part of its governmental duty. Monetary policy continued to be geared towards the freedom to borrow and to own. Failure to buy now, choosing to save instead, became a financial disaster. The fear of losing out required participation in the property game. Banks were simply playing their role in a political project that thought encouraging desire to own was a great thing, and they were convinced by eminent men, like <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/18/books/18leonhardt.html\">Alan Greenspan</a>, that risks were so well dispersed by the genius of modern mathematical economics, that there was no cause for concern. The bankers themselves did not understand the maths, but someone, somewhere apparently did.</p> <p>So this is where the blame game needs to end. Not with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/10/banking-executivesalaries\">greedy bankers</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/10/iceland-gordonbrown\">Icelanders</a>, the 'short sellers', or with <a href=\"http://www.opec.org/home/\">Opec</a>. Neither is this just about financial contagion from the US. Our banks were every bit as over-extended as theirs. Knowledge of our recent history is enough to tell us that giving banks the freedom to lend with no restrictions will cause problems and playing ideological games with money is highly dangerous, as the 1990s recession aptly demonstrated. The fact that the Bank of England knew this, and it is written all too clearly in our recent economic history makes it all the more disgraceful that we are here again.</p>",
  "<p>As the godfather of prudence, Gordon Brown still has an enviable reputation \u2013 even amid current turmoils \u2013 for taking the long view of things. Yet, not for the first time, <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article4916344.ece\">his article in the Times</a> this morning suggests the often overlooked overhasty side to his character. </p> <p>\"We must lead the world to financial stability,\" says the headline to his article. OK, those are the Times headline writers' words not Brown's \u2013 you won't find them in the actual text. Yet as good headlines often do, these words accurately encapsulate the tone of the piece. The article is full of self-congratulation about the way the British government has responded to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/creditcrunch\">banking crisis</a> and about how it is a model for a possible global initiative of the sort that George Bush may promote this weekend in Washington. But such self-congraulation is surely premature \u2013 especially as the equity markets have gone on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/10/marketturmoil-creditcrunch\">sliding so steeply around the world today</a>. If you were wanting to make a cheap point you might say that the government that banned short-selling on the markets is guilty of short-selling in politics.</p> <p>The times are too serious to make too many cheap points. But the plain political fact is that Gordon Brown has form when it comes to inflating his achievements. He also has form when it comes to posing as the Great Leader not just of his own grateful people but sometimes even of the whole world. Demands of the sort he made in the Times this morning calling for coordinated international action to solve common problems are a Brown political stock-in-trade. But they are rarely matched by a record of serious international achievement to go with it.</p> <p>If Brown succeeds in helping to craft a successful global governance response to the effects of the international credit crunch, then that will be a very great achievement indeed and I will be at the front of the line congratulating him. But please note two important words in the previous sentence. The first is \"helping\" \u2013 because in a highly diversified and volatile global economy, it is absurd for any one leader or government, even the United States, to lay down the law for all to follow. The world is more complicated than that. It depends on a give or take that is currently in fairly short supply among national governments (look at the EU's difficulties, look at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/10/banking-creditcrunch\">Iceland</a>). So claims to British leadership and vanguard roles are simply hubris.</p> <p>The second important word is \"successful\". We don't actually know if the much-vaunted British bank rescue package this week has worked. It may do so in time, but it is not working yet. It is a longterm project \u2013 a bulb that has just been planted in the soil without having yet had any time to grow. Brown should not claim the credit for the package until it has been proved one way or the other. The claim to be leading the world to financial stability is even more specious and unproven. There isn't even a global plan in place yet, let alone a plan that is proving that it works. Once again, Brown is grabbing at the glory long before there is glory to be shared out. It is demeaning.</p> <p>Of course, if the British plan works in the domestic market and if the British play a role in getting something workable underway in global markets then these would be great \u2013 even historic \u2013 achievements. But we are nowhere near being able to say whether either of things is the case. Claiming credit for things before they have had time to work is not just stupid. It may also be reckless. If things go belly-up then the claims of mastery look even more absurd. That is, after all, pretty much what has happened to Brown's record as chancellor. He overclaimed and has been proved wrong by events. Given Labour's position in the polls and Brown's long run of unpopularity, you can see why Brown must be tempted to exploit good news. But he would be much wiser to hold off, add patience to prudence, make fewer false claims and secure more real successes before grandstanding in this way.</p>",
  "<p>Stockmarkets around the world slumped today as fears of a global recession deepened. After <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/09/creditcrunch-shortselling\">Wall Street fell to a five-year low</a> last night, the rout started in Asia, where Singapore slid into recession, and quickly spread to Europe. In London, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/10/marketturmoil-creditcrunch\">FTSE 100 plunged more than 10%</a> in early trading, and the Dow Jones dived nearly 700 points to 7882 shortly after Wall Street opened, a fall of 8%. Both markets later came off their lows, and the FTSE 100 closed almost 9% down and the Dow was seen off almost 2%.</p> <h2>Asia-Pacific</h2> <p><strong>New Zealand</strong><br>New Zealand's benchmark NZX-50 index fell 4.7%, its biggest one-day fall since October 24 1997, at the height of the Asian financial crisis. The index closed down 139 points at 2805, its worst performance in six consecutive days of declines. Over the past six trading days the market has shed 427 points, or 14%.</p> <p><strong>Australia</strong><br>Australian market watchers called it Black Friday. In Sydney, the benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 plummeted 8.34%, or 360 points, to close at 3960, its biggest ever one-day percentage loss. Together with the 8.2% plunge on the broader All Ordinaries index, today's session wiped A$106bn (\u00a341bn) from the value of stocks. Nearly every stock fell.</p> <p><strong>Japan</strong><br>Tokyo's Nikkei plunged 9.6% to close at its worst week in history. It lost nearly a quarter of its value this week. The index tumbled 881 points to 8276, its lowest level since May 2003. It was the biggest one-day percentage fall since the stockmarket crash of October 1987. At one stage the Nikkei was down more than 11%, and the slump prompted the Tokyo bourse and the Osaka Securities Exchange to briefly suspend some futures and options trading.</p> <p>Yamato Life Insurance went bankrupt, the first major Japanese financial firm to collapse in the wake of the global credit crisis. Cash was king, with even Japanese government bonds being liquidated for funding. The Bank of Japan pumped \u00a54.5 trillion (\u00a326.97bn) into the money markets to ease liquidity. The yen, regarded as a safe-haven currency, jumped to a three-year high against the euro and a seven-year high against the pound.</p> <p><strong>South Korea</strong><br>The Seoul Composite index dropped 4.1% to 1241 points.</p> <p><strong>China</strong><br>The Shanghai Composite index fell 3.6% to 2000. China's central bank said it would make forceful efforts to boost domestic demand, and stressed the country's financial system was safe and stable. Analysts fear exports to the west will be hit hard.</p> <p><strong>Hong Kong</strong><br>The Hong Kong stockmarket closed on a three-year low. The benchmark Hang Seng index was down 1146 points, or 7.2%, to 14,796 after falling by more than 9.5% at one point. It is the first time the index has fallen below the 15,000-level since January 2006.</p> <p><strong>Singapore</strong><br>News that Singapore slid into recession for the first time since 2002 drove the Straits Times index lower by 162 points, or 7.7%, to 1940. The economy shrank 6.3% during the third quarter. Singapore's central bank responded by easing monetary policy for the first time in five years.</p> <p><strong>Taiwan</strong><br>Markets were closed for a national holiday.</p> <p><strong>Indonesia</strong><br>Share trading was suspended for a third day.</p> <p><strong>India </strong><br>India's central bank slashed its cash reserve requirement to free up some $12bn in funds and ease a squeeze that drove overnight rates in money markets to a 19-month high and forced the government to cancel a bond auction. The rupee hit an all-time low and the main stock index plunged more than 9%.</p> <p>India's finance minister said on TV that there was no need to worry about Indian bank deposits and investors should not panic. He said liquidity in the banking sector would improve once parliament gave the nod to providing more.</p> <h2>Middle East</h2> <p><strong>Israel</strong><br>The Tel Aviv stock exchange was shut for the Yom Kippur holiday.</p> <p><strong>Iraq</strong><br>The Baghdad stockmarket is booming, with the general index up by nearly 40% last month. Hotels and banks are among the hottest picks among the exchange's 95 listed companies, as violence has fallen to a four-year low. Saad Jalil, an investor, told Reuters: \"The world banking crisis won't affect us, our market is sealed off from the outside. We don't even have electronic trading.\" </p> <h2>Africa</h2> <p><strong>Egypt</strong><br>The Egyptian stockmarket fell 4.6% to 1993 points, after plunging 16.4% to a two-year low on Tuesday.</p> <p><strong>Zimbabwe</strong><br>While much of the rest of the world is anxious about plunging stock markets, bank collapses and a looming recession, Zimbabweans would settle for any of that just to be able to find cash and to have it worth something in the face of an official inflation rate of 231 million percent. </p> <p>Independent economists say the real inflation rate is in the trillions, but such numbers have ceased to mean anything to most Zimbabweans, who are limited to withdrawing the equivalent of a few pence a day from their bank accounts because of a drastic shortage of cash notes, with the Zimbabwe dollar in freefall.<br> This week the government legalised the use of US dollars and rand in shops, formalising a part of the extensive foreign currency black market driven by the 3 million Zimbabweans who have left the country in search of work, mostly in South Africa. Everyone else is reduced to scraping by on near worthless salaries, bartering their furniture for food or growing their own to survive. </p> <h2>Europe</h2> <p><strong>Central Europe</strong><br>Russia, Romania and Ukraine suspended their stockmarkets today. The cost of insuring the sovereign debt of Ukraine, Kazakhstan and other eastern European countries soared, pricing in a mounting risk of default. Emerging sovereign debt spreads widened over US treasuries to their widest levels since mid-2004.</p> <p><strong>Russia</strong><br>The Kremlin admitted it was considering a Brown-style plan to ease Russia's dire banking problems. The Russian government will set up a special fund to buy \"quality\" assets from banks struggling with liquidity. Initially, Russia's central bank would pump in $15bn.</p> <p>Russia's twin leaders, meanwhile, have wasted little time in blaming the US. President Dmitry Medvedev this week memorably accused the US administration of \"economic egoism\". Vladimir Putin, Russia's prime minister, went further. During a meeting with Russian communists, he said the US's dominant role in economic matters was over. \"Confidence in the United States as the leader of the free world and the free market... has been undermined \u2013 for good \u2013 I think,\" Putin gleefully observed.</p> <p>At the same time, Russia has been keen to understate its own economic difficulties. Although regulators suspended trading again today on Russia's two main stockmarkets, TV news channels have been told not to use the words \"collapse\" or \"crisis\". Apparently there isn't one. There has been little mention on TV of the flight of foreign investors from Russia, or the fact that many Russian oligarchs are struggling to pay their dry cleaning bills.</p> <p><strong>Czech Republic</strong><br>Stocks in Prague fell more than 13%.</p> <p><strong>Hungary</strong><br>Shares in Budapest lost more than 12% and the Hungarian forint hit a two-year low.</p> <p><strong>Poland</strong><br>The Polish deputy finance minister, Katarzyna Zajdel-Kurowska, said the fundamentals of Poland's economy were strong, and blamed the overnight decline of the Polish zloty on the slump in Hungary. The zloty hit an eight-month low.</p> <p><strong>Iceland</strong><br>There was no international trade of the Icelandic crown today after its banking sector, currency and economy crashed. Iceland says it has approached Russia for a loan to cover its banking liabilities, with analysts also speculating over a possible bail-out from the International Monetary Fund.</p> <p><strong>Austria</strong><br>Share trading was briefly halted in Vienna this morning.</p> <p><strong>France</strong><br>The CAC-40 index in Paris dropped 7.7% to 3176. </p> <p><strong>Germany</strong><br>The Dax closed 7.1% down at 4541 points.</p> <p><strong>Sweden</strong><br>Sweden's stock exchange declared a \"fast market\" until further notice for cash trading and for the Nordic derivatives market. The bourse said a fast market is declared when a financial market is experiencing high volume and increased volatility. The move allows greater flexibility in some trading rules. Shares in Stockholm fell nearly 6% to 196 points this morning.</p> <p><strong>Italy</strong><br>Nearly half of Milan stocks were suspended after excessive losses. Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi said the stockmarkets were in a grip of panic and fear, and expected consumption to fall due to fear. He said the government and the Bank of Italy had asked banks not to call in loans and to keep supporting industry. He also said European Union leaders may discuss the \"hypothesis\" of suspending markets temporarily while trying to resolve the global financial crisis.</p> <p><strong>Spain</strong><br>The Madrid stock exchange lost 8.7% to 973 points at the close. Spanish prime minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero is pushing for an urgent meeting of the 15 eurozone leaders. He asked French president Nicolas Sarkozy, who currently holds the rotating EU presidency, to call the meeting \"to define a strong, coordinated action among all the countries in the eurozone.\"</p> <p><strong>Switzerland</strong><br>The Swiss market dropped 4.75% to 5523 points.</p> <p><strong>UK</strong><br>A wave of panic selling wiped more than \u00a3100bn off the value of Britain's biggest companies. </p> <p>Dealers in the City dumped shares when trading began, sending the FTSE 100 plummeting by more than 10% in early trading. It closed 8.85% lower at 3932.1 \u2013 a 381.7 point fall, wiping about \u00a389.5bn off the value of Britain's biggest companies. This is the worst daily fall since the crash of 1987, beating Monday's 7.85% decline.</p> <p>Banks and miners led the fallers, along with blue chip firms such as British Airways and BT, as the wider economy was pulled into the deepening financial crisis.</p> <h2>America/South America</h2> <p><strong>United States</strong><br>On Wall Street, the Dow Jones plummeted nearly 700 points in the first ten minutes of trading to 7882, a fall of 8%.</p> <p><strong>Brazil</strong><br>Brazil's main stock index plummeted more than 10% in early trading. The Ibovespa index fell 10.2% to 33,303 in just the first half-hour after markets opened. Trading was then halted for 30 minutes because of a \"circuit breaker\" rule that kicks in when the Ibovespa loses 10%. Global financial turmoil has wiped out two years of stock market gains in Latin America's biggest economy. Brazil's currency, the real, weakened to 2.3 against the US dollar.</p> <p><strong>Venezuela</strong><br>President Hugo Chavez said his socialist revolution was not immune from the global financial crisis. State bonds on international markets have dropped to their lowest levels in five years and plunging oil prices are expected to squeeze next year's budget. Consumer spending on cars and other big items has already started to shrivel. </p> <p>The finance minister, Ali Rodriguez, made an unfamiliar call for austerity in government departments. \"Spending on certain types of vehicles, mobile phones and parties will be eliminated,\" he said. </p> <p>Chavez said Venezuela's state-heavy economy was better positioned to weather the financial storm, a \"sinking of neoliberalism\" which he blamed on the International Monetary Fund. He hoped the crisis would prompt other Latin American leaders to forge ahead with his cherished plan to create a \"Bank of the South\" to counter the Washington-dominated World Bank.</p> <p><strong>Cuba</strong><br>Cuba's isolation from global financial markets has largely protected it from capitalist contagion, allowing it to watch the turmoil with relative equanimity. \"It was expected,\" the former president, Fidel Castro, noted in his regular column in the communist party newspaper, Granma. </p> <p>Other pro-government commentators blamed the crisis on the US and said \"associates or tributaries of that empire\" were now suffering the consequences. They said the time had come for Latin America to form the pan-regional leftist front which Cuba and Venezuela have espoused.</p> <p>Cuba is facing its own crisis after a series of recent hurricanes devastated agriculture and infrastructure. President Raul Castro has warned of food shortages and months, if not years, of painful rebuilding. This week, the government started to lease land to private farmers, a cautious but potentially important initiative to loosen communist control and reform the island's moribund agriculture.</p>",

  "<p>A funny thing has happened on the way to the forum. As the institutions of super-capitalism continue to implode, a number of conservative commentators have started to <a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/id/162789\">lay blame for the mess on poor people</a>.</p> <p>Now that might seem strange given that poor people control approximately no major financial institutions. And it might seem unfair in light of the unprecedented redistribution of wealth away from the working and middle classes and toward the wealthy these past several years. According to <a href=\"http://www.urban.org/publications/411678.html\">the Urban Institute</a>, 60% of low-income families still don't own homes, despite years of the hard sell designed to get them to buy. More than a third of them don't own cars, which in many instances means they can't get jobs since they have no way of getting to work. Nine out of 10 of them have no retirement savings. By contrast, <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/2008/03/05/richest-people-billionaires-billionaires08-cx_lk_0305billie_land.html\">Forbes</a> recently estimated that America's 499 billionaires (a number that has doubled in the past eight years) control $1.4tn in assets - or at least they did until the catastrophic market failures of the past month. </p> <p>It might even seem bizarre given the fact that millions of desperate men and women signed onto utterly manipulative, usurious, \"creative\" mortgages during the sub-prime gold-rush years, and, as a result, ended up losing what little capital they had accumulated over lifetimes of hard work as well as losing the roofs over their heads. To stretch a point, one could even view such a suggestion as offensive, since so many banks got into trouble by bundling mortgage securities that only preserved their value and generated profits so long as enough poor people signed on for the ride and agreed to be screwed.</p> <p>But, apparently, that's because you and I, dear readers, don't understand the intense psychological pull poor people have on rich folks, a pull that can, apparently, make the world's hardest, meanest and most ruthless CEOs - highly educated men and women who've spent years honing the fine arts of profit-making - part with good money on a whim and hand it over to a bunch of irresponsible, check-bouncing layabouts.</p> <p><a href=\"http://mediamatters.org/items/200809190021\">Fox News's Neil Cavuto</a> went so far as to explicitly link banks' lending to minority customers - a move they only reluctantly agreed to after decades of redlining minority neighbourhoods and effectively removing most African-Americans from the home-ownership society - with the current financial collapse. Thursday night, on Larry King, a conservative spokeswoman accused the community organising group Acorn of \"pressuring\" banks to give mortgage loans to people with no jobs. Barack Obama is supported by Acorn. QED: the whole bloody mess is Obama's fault.</p> <p>Let's forget for a minute about the attempt to blame the collapsing global financial edifice on a man who in one breath the Republicans accuse of having no government experience and in the next try to position as being single-handedly responsible for the creation of trillions of dollars in dubious loans. Let's look at the deeper notion that manipulative poor people are responsible for all of our current pocket-ache.</p> <p>Earlier this year, researchers from <a href=\"http://www.demos.org/page2.cfm\">Demos</a>, the US think-tank of which I am a fellow, published a book on America's escalating personal debt crisis, entitled <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Up-Our-Eyeballs-Hidden-America/dp/1595582118/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1223616207&amp;sr=8-1\">Up to Our Eyeballs</a>. Among the findings: starting four or five years back, mortgage brokers were being paid by sub-prime lenders to trawl low-income and minority neighbourhoods looking for marks whom they could hang high-interest rate loans on. The brokers were paid \"yield spread premiums\" for getting borrowers to accept higher interest rate loans than the baseline rate the company would have been prepared to lend them money at. The loans were front-loaded with high fees and adorned with such small-print items as pre-payment penalties. Between 1994 and 2005, the authors found, \"sub-prime home loans increased from $35bn to $665bn.\" </p> <p>Many of these loans were given to people who in fact would have qualified for regular mortgages had they only known where to look and how to go about applying. Had they gotten those regular mortgages, they might not have faced personal ruin when their variable rates kicked in in 2007 and 2008. But then, again, had they got those mortgages, a whole lot of sub-prime middle-men wouldn't have gotten their profits.</p> <p>That unqualified borrowers were given huge loans is, at this point, a given. That these borrowers, en masse, are to blame for the resultant crisis makes no sense. Sure, some people took out huge mortgages they had no intention of paying off simply because they were selfish. But that's not the story experienced by most of the low-income borrowers. </p> <p>Let's get real here. People borrowed because they were presented with offers they couldn't refuse. They were told that home ownership was the path to prosperity, and, like everyone else, they wanted their chance to realise their dreams. When they held back from buying property, they found the decks stacked against them. The same people who urged deregulation of the mortgage industry also lobbied for an end to rent controls and curtailments of government-funded public housing. </p> <p>And for those who still held back, who risked ever-rising rents and ever-greater economic disempowerment, they were bombarded with pre-approval notices regarding mortgage applications from banks and finance companies who thought they could make a few quick bucks. They were repeatedly told, by financial specialists who ought to have known better, that buying, and then refinancing, their homes was a painless way to cushion their lifestyles. After all, the shills said, property values would inevitably keep soaring. And they were misled by brokers who didn't tell them what sub-prime loans really entailed. </p> <p>So I'll say it again: yes, many people made bad bets, didn't read the small print, didn't understand what they were getting into. But these are poor people, most of whom don't have the benefit of years of specialised higher education. When the times were good, conservatives were gleeful at the money liberated by lending to them at inflated rates of interest. How truly shameful that now that the chips are down they're asking the poor to shoulder the moral responsibility for the country's fiscal collapse. It's as stupid a notion as Marie Antoinette telling Paris's starving masses to eat cake when they could no longer afford their daily bread.</p>",
  "<p>Today, a bunch of women are going to attempt to remind the government about climate change - a subject which appears, frankly, to have slipped its mind lately. The <a href=\"http://www.climaterush.co.uk/\">Climate Rush</a> is modelled on the \"rush\" on parliament 100 years ago by the <a href=\"http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/suffragettes.htm\">Suffragettes</a>. </p> <p>On Friday a group of protesters targeted the <a href=\"http://www.rbs.co.uk/\">Royal Bank of Scotland</a> for its aggressive pro-fossil fuel investment policies. And by Saturday the organisers of the <a href=\"http://www.anarchistbookfair.org/\">London Anarchist bookfair</a> will be hoping that \"capitalism will have already collapsed in a global financial meltdown! Hooray!\"</p> <p>Now, if you're an environmental activist what are you thinking at the moment? Are you thinking, ooh, those poor wee strongholds of the capitalist system have had a terrible week, I'll leave them alone and give them a chance to pull themselves together? I'm sure when they've had a nice cup of Oolong tea and a sitdown they'll get round to thinking about those melting ice caps again. Or are you thinking: Wahey! Get in! Pour sugar in their petrol tanks while they're still scratching their heads in the boardrooms! </p> <p>Hopefully you're going to say the latter.</p> <p>Take Climate Rush. In honour of the Suffragettes, the Climate Rush - organised by a woman-only collective which includes members of <a href=\"http://www.planestupid.com/\">Plane Stupid</a> - is planning to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/oct/12/activists-climatechange\">gather outside the Houses of Parliament</a>, hear some speeches, and then \u2026 get up to something. What precisely is not clear. </p> <p>Now, if this is a good bit of action, it will come at the perfect time to remind MPs of their environmental responsibilities. After all, the situation hasn't just lightened briefly to give us a break while we cope with financial meltdown - and the <a href=\"http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2007-08/climatechangehl.html\">climate bill </a>is due to go for its third reading in the House of Commons soon. </p> <p>Sure, MPs are nervous and may stampede if goaded too far. But if they're panicked enough, hopefully they'll stampede in the right direction.<br>And what about targeting businesses like RBS who are already under tremendous strain? Even my stony heart was moved to pity when I saw the <a href=\"http://uk.finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=RBS.L&amp;t=5y&amp;l=on&amp;z=m&amp;q=l&amp;c=\">RBS share price</a>: it's like looking at a cardiograph at the moment of the arrest, with a long steady history and then a sudden nauseatingly vertical plunge. </p> <p>Once again, however, hearts must be hardened: there was never a better moment to apply pressure. </p> <p>For two and half years now environmental groups including <a href=\"http://www.platformlondon.org/\">Platform</a> and <a href=\"http://peopleandplanet.org/\">People &amp; PLanet</a> have been targeting RBS's self-applied moniker The Oil and Gas Bank: RBS have been involved in financing projects such as the <a href=\"http://www.greenconsumerguide.com/domesticll.php?news=1694&amp;CLASSIFICATION=85\">Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan</a> pipeline (a problematic project from the start), and are now (since their ill-fated takeover of ABN/Amro last year anyway) the financiers of Gazprom's stake in the disastrous Russian <a href=\"http://www.sakhalin.environment.ru/en/\">Sakhalin II project</a>. </p> <p>Although they're unlikely to divest from much of this stuff at the moment, any bank is going to be terrified of losing customers, and campaigns like this can really begin to eat in to the vital student market. In the 1980s <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barclays_Bank#Involvement_with_South_Africa_under_apartheid\">Barclays finally pulled out of South Africa</a> after a leaked memo revealed that the long-running boycott was cutting student sign-ups, which is the key to the future customer base of any bank: climate change is certainly a subject which will appeal to students as much as apartheid. </p> <p>RBS just can't afford to lose the future when everything looks so dubious in the present, so at the very least if this pressure carries on they will have to do more than make soothing noises. </p> <p>And as for the anarchist book fair this weekend? (A brilliant gig by the way - you always learn something new, even if it's only how to set up your own radical feminist tantric massage collective.) It's only fair enough really. As the anarchist house mag <a href=\"http://www.schnews.org.uk/index.php\">Schnews </a>said this week: \"Blimey, you spend 15 years struggling against global capitalism and then the bloody thing collapses of its own accord\". </p> <p>I imagine the mood will be cheerful.</p>",

  "<p>The American bank Morgan Stanley faces a critical weekend as it awaits a $9bn investment from Japan's Mitsubishi that has become crucial to fend off a crisis of confidence among investors which is increasingly threatening its survival.</p> <p>The 73-year-old firm has been battling to quell persistent rumours about its financial condition in a market still smarting from the abrupt collapse of rival Wall Street banks Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns.</p> <p>Alarmed by a warning that ratings agency Moody's is considering downgrading Morgan Stanley's credit worthiness, shareholders dumped stock in their droves today. The bank's shares plunged by 22% in New York, taking their total week-long fall to 60%. </p> <p>In a deal agreed last month, the Japanese bank Mitsubishi pledged to pay $9bn for a 21% stake in Morgan Stanley, bolstering the firm's balance sheet. The transaction is due to close on Tuesday but the recent plunge in Morgan Stanley's shares has taken the market capitalisation of the entire bank down to just $10.7bn.</p> <p>Both Morgan Stanley and Mitsubishi insisted today that the capital injection was still going ahead. But there is concern that the Japanese bank may seek to renegotiate terms, possibly by demanding a bigger slice of Morgan Stanley given the potentially perilous impact on confidence in the US bank if it walks away.</p> <p>Morgan Stanley insiders have blamed short sellers for aggravating the rout in its shares. One source said \"bank\" had simply become a \"four letter word\" to the markets irrespective of the underlying logic.</p> <p>But to Morgan Stanley's fury, the ratings agency Moody's provided fuel for doubters by warning that it may downgrade the bank's credit score - a move which would make it harder to raise new funds.</p> <p>Moody's cited an expectation that \"an expected downturn in global capital market activity will reduce Morgan Stanley's revenue and profit potential in 2009, and perhaps beyond this period\". </p> <p>One of the most venerable financial institutions in the US, Morgan Stanley employs 48,000 people at 600 offices in 35 countries. It got a qualified vote of confidence from analyst Richard Bove of Ladenburg Thalmann who cut profit estimates but said Morgan Stanley remained highly viable.</p> <p>\"This firm, if left to run its businesses, is likely to produce continuous profits, even though at much reduced rates,\" said Bove. \"Companies should continue to do business with Morgan Stanley and keep it in business.\"</p> <p>Morgan Stanley is far from the only bank under pressure. Goldman Sachs saw its stock drop by 12% today. Anxiety levels in the markets were ratcheted up after credit derivatives linked to the failed US investment bank Lehman Brothers, with a face value estimated at $200bn (\u00a3118bn) to $440bn, began to be unwound. </p> <p>Many banks are involved in the credit derivatives market and are exposed to the Lehman default. They include RBS and Barclays which could be forced to make further writedowns if they fail to recover all of their money.</p> <p>Financial firms sold credit default swaps (CDSs) - a form of insurance against a company defaulting on its debt - to investors in Lehman's bonds and those betting on the bank's creditworthiness. These companies will now be forced to pay out 91.4 cents in the dollar. The figure is more than market expectations for losses on underlying Lehman bonds.</p> <p>Banks around the world are hoarding cash partly in preparation for the settlement of these credit derivatives linked to a wave of major corporate defaults and lower than expected recovery levels. There have been seven major defaults in the past month, including those by US mortgage giants Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and banking group Washington Mutual. Most recently a rash of Icelandic banking failures have added to the sense of foreboding. </p> <p>\"There are going to be others,\" said one credit analyst. \"This is just the start.\"</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p>Welcome to our live webchat with JJ Abrams, the award-winning American writer and producer behind hits such as Lost, Felicity, Alias and Cloverfield and his new drama Fringe.</p> <p>Join us from 6pm BST (that's 10am LA time, folks) when the Emmy and Golden Globe winning writer and producer will answer your blog questions from his Los Angeles base.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/organgrinder/2008/oct/07/television.bskyb\">Here is the list of questions that JJ will be answering.</a></p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>6.10pm BST - </strong></p> <p><strong>Fox - not noted for their commitment to genre shows... have you plotted out as far as 7 seasons like Lost or do you see Fringe as being a 4-5 Season arc ?<br>from - djbollocks</strong></p> <p>JJ - Yes [on Fringe]. We have a big picture which we are working to. We have a six chapter idea. That inevitably changes along the way. You make discoveries which you can't anticipate.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>I've enjoyed the shows you've helped create, in particular Alias, and enjoyed the pilot of Fringe which was shown in the UK last week. One common theme seems to be the shadowy organisation (SD-6, Dharma, Massive Dynamics) - I wondered if this reflects any views of yours from the real world?<br>from - baydr</strong></p> <p>JJ - I am sure it does. The idea of mystery and hidden agenda is fertile ground for drama. While I am not especially a conspiracy theorist it is hard not to suspect decisions are being made behind closed doors that affect us all. I try not to be paranoid. It is hard to look at things politically about the corporate world and not be a little suspect.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>You have never been seen in the same room as Dr Who renvigorator Russell T Davies- are you actually the same person?</strong></p> <p><strong>If you aren't (and the jury is stll out), would you like to director or script an episode of Dr Who?</strong></p> <p><strong>from - Sydney2K</strong></p> <p>JJ - It would be an honour to be asked to participate in Doctor Who. They are doing a spectacular job. That is not to say I am not already involved as Doctor Who! It would be a wonderful thing and I am a fan. If Russell would ever like to direct anything in my place I would be equally honoured.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>With Fringe, you have moved away from heavily serialised storytelling towards the procedural. What sort of challenges have you faced with this?<br>from - GavinElster</strong></p> <p>JJ - It is hard mostly because it is not the kind of storytelling I tend to be drawn to. It was an experiment I was desperate to try. One of the challenges is for character development to happen despite the format. One thing that gets me excited are the clues and revelations. We are trying to do some of that even in the standalone episodes.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>Do you have a fear of flying?</strong></p> <p><strong>Is there some grand overarching general statement you are attempting to make to the world at large through your explorations into the fringe, the metaphysical, the unexplainable, such as 'there's more to life than meets the eye' or are you simply trying to tell an interesting story. </strong></p> <p><strong>From - nosoup4u</strong></p> <p>JJ - I don't have a fear of flying. I have always had an appreciation for stories that have lived in this arena, whether it is Frankenstein or the films of David Cronenberg. I loved Altered States. The idea of science as a constantly evolving infinite possibility is as exciting as it is scary. The subject matter has always interested me.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>To you, is there an upcoming episode that you are especially proud of and you think will be a fan favourite when the series is finished?</strong></p> <p><strong>Also, I have noticed a certain formula in the structure of the episodes so far. Is this something that is going to carry on, or will there be variations on this formula? Sorry if that isn't too specific.</strong></p> <p><strong>From - owlwaxer</strong></p> <p>JJ - We are still finding our rhythm. If you look back at the early episodes of your favourite shows you will find they are a little bit to the left of what the show ultimately became. I feel we are still arriving. The fourth episode, The Arrival, is closer to what the show will be.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>Lost - was it vaguely planned out from Season 1 to Season 6/7 in terms of what you wanted to happen (depending of course on how many seasons you were allowed), or did you have a start point and an end point and how you got from one to the other was to be decided?<br> CBPodge</strong></p> <p>JJ - We had a lot of possibilities as to where the show would go. The truth is, I haven't been running it since i went off to do MI:III. The evolution of what the show has become now is something that we could never have completely planned out. Like any great showrunner, Damon Lindelof has been decisive as he has become flexible. As to what the ultimate resolution is, there is just a vague resemblance to what we decided when we first started doing the show.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>Why do you think writers/creators such as yourself and Joss Whedon are getting so much attention? You're almost a celebrity in your own right; whereas writing scripts used to be very much a behind-the-scenes job.....<br> sharppencil21</strong></p> <p>JJ - I would much rather be an almost celebrity rather than a celebrity. I don't think anyone really cares much about anything I do or say but when people are surrounded by the kind of people I have been lucky enough to work with it definitely makes you look good. It is flattering that people are interested in what I do.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>LOST has a been big success but do you have any specific regrets about the series so far?<br> Marenco</strong></p> <p>JJ - The only thing I regret is that i have ADD and I have been so busy with other things that I miss being there full time. I miss hanging out with Damon. I miss the actors with whom I had such an incredible time on the pilot. If I have any feelings about the show it is pride and amazement in what Damon has done.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>Is it true that there will be a Cloverfield 2?<br> Titan777</strong></p> <p>JJ - There is an idea that we are working on that I hope will come to fruition. We are playing with it right now. Obviously we don't want to commit to something we don't love and feel inspired by but we have a pretty cool idea we are playing with.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>Is Fringe going to be a big mystery as Lost is, with all the cryptic clues.<br>Or will Fringe be a light venture?<br> yamatoEva</strong></p> <p>JJ - There will be and there already is, and episode 4 begins it, the over-arcing mystery of the show. The goal is to do both - to tune in and enjoy without knowing anything that comes before it but also if you watch every week you will see things you understand and that are connected to the larger picture. We are looking at both of them.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>Are you happy with the development of the female characters in Lost? It seems that Kate started out as a feisty take no shit kind'a girl, and now...shes..err...not.<br> Butch01</strong></p> <p>JJ - That really should be a question for Damon. Kate is extraordinary. The character is far more complex than someone who can be described by one or two descriptors.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>Do you think that Alias ended early?<br> corpulent</strong></p> <p>JJ - I don't actually. I feel like Alias was an interesting thing. We started it like a much more serialised show and we were told by the network that it had to become much more of a stand alone show. It made it difficult to have the series perceived as it was originally intended. It was always a niche success and I don't think it ended too early.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>What's the best thing about being a writer? Do you have any tips/advice for those just starting out?<br> sharppencil21</strong></p> <p>JJ - The biggest and best piece of advice is probably silly sounding but - keep writing. A lot of people who want to be writers talk about it a lot but they don't write as much as they discuss it. The key is writing. The great news is you don't need anything apart from some paper and pencil or a laptop. You don't need permission or anyone's cooperation. It really is the key - just do as much of it as you can. If you keep it up, things will start happening for you.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>Do you have the same enthusiasm working on FRINGE that you have whilst working on LOST? Is the energy the same, if not, in which ways is it different?<br> Fringie</strong></p> <p>JJ - I have as much enthusiasm working on any new project. Obviously certain things get complicated. For example, working on Fringe I really wanted to work on the pilot but I was also working on Star Trek so I was unable to do both. It was a very surreal thing having to give up that opportunity. I was so jealous. The hardest thing for me on that was just being involved in other things. Every project is different but the enthusiasm is always at the core of why I am involved with it at the beginning.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>What made you touch Star Trek?</strong></p> <p>JJ - I think it was the opportunity to tell a story that was based on a world and characters that I felt were just compelling and optimistic and the opportunity to treat that universe with a kind of energy and excitement and the resources we had. It didn't feel like a classic reboot or prequel. It is a brand new thing inspired by characters that are poised to make a big comeback.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>One of the many great things about LOST is it's international cast - the story has had characters from all different types of backgrounds and many different nationalities. Do you plan to intergrate such a global make-up into the Fringe story-line, or is this more difficult to achieve with a story that's primarily based in Boston?<br> Fringie</strong></p> <p>JJ - It will be hard to make the show as universal as Lost simply because the international flight lent itself so perfectly to that. We do have ideas of expanding the world that Olivia travels. In the first season we have her leaving the country and travelling elsewhere. I love that and certainly hope to do that with Fringe.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>Now with your string of hits behind you do you feel you can pitch anything and get a studio to green light it? If so do you see a downside to this?<br> Nige365</strong></p> <p>JJ - Absolutely not. </p> <p>The second question: I think it would be a frightening and disastrous situation if we are not working and collaborating with people like those at Warner Bros. They are very helpful with making things better. I rely on the comments that I get from the people I work with. It would be a disaster if they said yes to everything.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>Is the mythology behind the island in Lost that we see in season 4 the same mythology that you originally envisaged when you created the series? I have a sneaky feeling that it has been manipulated over time to keep staying one step ahead of the guessing fanbase...<br> JerzyBondov</strong></p> <p>JJ - There are some elements close to what Damon and I discussed when we first discussed it. Damon has taken it in a far more sophisticated and interesting direction because he has had to. Damon has brilliantly expanded upon that and created an amazing narrative for that.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>Hey JJ, Lost is weird and wonderful - something I'd imagine some silly TV people wouldn't get or would turn down, how on Earth did you pitch it to get it commissioned by ABC? Thank-you!<br> Polite</strong></p> <p>JJ - That is a good question. The answer is the head of ABC at the time asked me to come up with a show that was about survivors of a plane crash. We turned in a 20-page outline in five days. Lloyd Braun at ABC greenlit the show immediately and we scrambled within 11 weeks to write and cast it and it was a two-hour pilot. If we had gone in and pitched it we would have been met with a rejection. As they came to us it provided us with a very different set of challenges.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>Let's say that someone here in the UK wanted to write for Fringe. Would this be possible if they had the right story idea, and how would you recommend they proceed?<br> Eighthours</strong></p> <p>JJ - Legally we can't accept anything from an unsolicited writer.

  "<p>Here are some observations by Frank Bruni, to whom the New York Times assigned the task of writing a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/08/us/politics/08assess.html?hp=&amp;pagewanted=print\">front page \"news analysis\"</a> of Tuesday night's presidential debate:</p> <blockquote> <p>McCain tried to play happy warrior - but didn't have much to smile about.</p> <p>Neither candidate was selling morning in America. At times it seemed more like a competition to see who could paint the gloaming in the least unsettling hues.</p> <p>Candidates' voices communicated anger less often than mere frustration. The decibel level was sometimes whispery and the gestures usually muted. There were no exaggerated huffs, no big laughs, no long sighs.</p> <p>\u2026the sort of can-do, feel-good, rah-rah exuberance that candidates sometimes bring to debates was in conspicuously short supply.</p> <p>But during the first hour of the debate, candidates' voices communicated anger less often than mere frustration. The decibel level was sometimes whispery and the gestures usually muted. There were no exaggerated huffs, no big laughs, no long sighs.</p> <p>Despite some odd verbal hiccups during that exchange, Mr Obama spoke more fluidly than Mr McCain, and so calmly that the town-hall format was a largely wasted opportunity. Mr Obama did not use it to communicate any of the spontaneity he has been accused of lacking.</p> <p>Mr McCain, for his part, used the paper in front of him to write so many notes to himself, in such a focused fashion, that he could have passed for a student in a penmanship class.</p> </blockquote> <p>What dear reader, do all of these observations have in common? Well, many things, no doubt, but at least one of these is the fact that none of them makes a damn bit of difference with regard to who should be the next president. You would think that the New York Times had assigned the job of covering one of the three most important political events of the past four years to its food critic, rather than someone versed in the issues that face the next president.</p> <p>Ha ha, you get it. They did. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/ref/dining/bruni-bio.html\">Bruni is the paper's food critic</a>. Of course, once upon a time, he was assigned to cover George Bush - during the 2000 campaign and for Bush's first term as president. And to be honest, judging by his political coverage, you can see why the Times editors thought he'd make a fine food critic. Back in 2000, Bruni's coverage of those presidential debates were just as contentless as the ones he did eight years later. <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9502E3DF1E3DF937A35753C1A9669C8B63\">Take a look</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>It was not enough for vice-president Al Gore to venture a crisp pronunciation of Milosevic, as in Slobodan, the Yugoslav president who refuses to be pried from power \u2026 Mr Gore had to go a step further, volunteering the name of Mr Milosevic's challenger, Vojislav Kostunica. Then he had to go a step beyond that, noting that Serbia plus Montenegro equals Yugoslavia\u2026. And as Mr Gore loped effortlessly through the Balkans, barely able to suppress his self-satisfied grin, it became ever clearer that the point of all the thickets of consonants and proper nouns was not a geopolitical lesson\u2026. It was more like oratorical intimidation, an unwavering effort to upstage and unnerve an opponent whose mind and mouth have never behaved in a similarly encyclopaedic fashion.</p> </blockquote> <p>Bruni also felt compelled to note that Gore was \"barely able to suppress his self-satisfied grin\" as if these were the kinds of characteristics upon which voters might be invited to judge their presidential candidates. Meanwhile, in Bruni's view, \"George Bush presented himself 'as the country's best hope for bridging ideological divides, healing partisan wounds and making sure Americans could gaze upon the White House with unfettered respect'.\"</p> <p>Back then, in the lead story in The New York Times following the third and most crucial presidential Bush-Gore debate, readers were forced to wade through 22 full paragraphs before reading a word of substance with regard to either candidate's policy positions. And even here, as veteran journalists Bill Kovach and Tom Rosensteil noted, coverage was cast not in the context of the issues themselves, but strictly in terms of how they \"played\" as political theatre.</p> <p>I don't mean to pick on Mr Bruni. But I do mean to wonder, aloud, why the most important newspaper in the country wants this kind of coverage so badly that they would go back to it even after the 2000 debacle. I mean, it so happens that <a href=\"http://www.pollster.com/blogs/re_debate_reaction_town_hall_d.php\">Obama beat McCain on Tuesday night</a> on style as much as substance, as every single network poll afterward indicated. But what if he hadn't. What if, like Al Gore, he had a few annoying mannerisms but was far better prepared, better tempered, more intelligent, more patient, and more in sync on issue after issue with the nation than his opponent \u2014 as he also happened to be \u2014 and yet his opponent was a better actor? Would that matter?</p> <p>Since when did our most important news organisations decide that the actual issues that face a president are irrelevant to calculations as to who should actually be president? When did these debates become subject to the judgments that are more appropriate to a reality TV show such as American Idol?\" (Sadly, it obviously predates American Idol.)</p> <p>We have seen the danger of judging a president the way we judge a good steak. (\"Plenty of sizzle, not much flavour\u2026\")</p> <p>Turn to the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/08/opinion/08wed1.html\">editorial page of the New York Times</a>, and you can actually find the information you need to understand the key dynamic of the debate:</p> <blockquote> <p>In a way, we should not be surprised that Mr McCain has stooped so low, since the debate showed once again that he has little else to talk about. He long ago abandoned his signature issues of immigration reform and global warming; his talk of \"victory\" in Iraq has little to offer a war-weary nation; and his Reagan-inspired ideology of starving government and shredding regulation lies in tatters on Wall Street.</p> </blockquote> <p>But what's the point of hiding that inside the newspaper? How is that substance is relegated to the opinion pages while the front page \"analysis\" offers little more than the kind of irrelevant diversion from which a serious, respected newspaper is supposed to be the antidote?</p>",
  "<p>As the old joke goes, I love work; in fact, I could watch it all day. I suspect this is true for many of us, but the way things are going with the global economy, even opportunities to watch work may be strictly limited for some time to come. Who knows \u2013 we may all come to long for the days when we could actually find some to do ourselves.<br> There is a long tradition of writing about the joys and sorrows of labour. In the classical world, poetry tended more towards a celebration of the former. This is an attitude that can be traced back to the Greek poet Hesiod, whose long poem <a href=\"http://www.animalrightshistory.org/library/hesiod/cooke-works-and-days-1.htm\">Works and Days</a> is both an exhortation to an industrious life of self-sufficiency and a practical handbook for those who wish to follow that path. <br> Hesiod's poem was a model for, among others, Virgil, whose <a href=\"http://classics.mit.edu/Virgil/georgics.mb.txt\">Georgics</a> also take the form, at least superficially, of a practical manual for farmers. I say superficially for two reasons. First, the four poems that comprise Virgil's work are distinctly lacking in the kind of detail necessary in a useful farmers' manual. More importantly, Virgil used the trope of the hard-working farmer in the Georgics as a kind of allegorical representation of what he felt the industrious, moral, useful citizen of the empire should be like.<br> It's an approach that must surely have chimed with Walt Whitman 1,900 years later when he wrote <a href=\"http://www.poetseers.org/early_american_poets/walt_whitman/leaves_of_grass/i_hear_america_singing\">I Hear America Singing</a>. In this poem, Whitman celebrates work as representing everything that is good about the United States. Labour represents freedom, opportunity, individuality and everything hopeful about the American Dream. </p> <p>It is salutary, then, to balance his optimism with other, less sanguine, views. Two poems that contradict Whitman are <a href=\"http://www.poetryfoundation.org/archive/poem.html?id=\" 177395\" \">Brass Spittoons</a> by Langston Hughes, which reflects the experiences of those at the bottom of the American work ladder, and Maya Angelou's <a href=\"http://famouspoetsandpoems.com/poets/maya_angelou/poems/502.html\">Woman Work</a>, which brings us into the world of those whose work is the vital, unpaid trudge of the homemaker.<br> In Britain, at least since the Industrial Revolution, there hasn't been a whole lot of poetry written to celebrate the glories of work; poets have seemingly been more concerned with chronicling the hardships of the labouring classes and the disintegration of their traditional communities and way of life. Two examples of this tendency \u2013 both, as it happens, from the north-east of England \u2013 are Basil Bunting's ballad of poverty and emigration, <a href=\"http://www.dur.ac.uk/basil-bunting-poetry.centre/poems.quotes/gin.goodwife.stint/\">Gin the Goodwife Stint</a> and Anne Stevenson's lament for the victims of Durham's coal-mining industry, <a href=\"http://www.poetryfoundation.org/archive/poem.html?id=180220\">Forgotten of the Foot</a>.<br> Of course, poets have also been concerned to convince the rest of us that the making of poems is also work of a sort. Some, such as Samuel Taylor Coleridge, have seemed less than entirely convinced by the strength of their case; what are we to make of a poem on this theme called <a href=\"http://www.poetryfoundation.org/archive/poem.html?id=173255\">Work Without Hope</a>, in which the poet is \"the sole unbusy thing\"? We need to return to an American optimist for a more upbeat view of the poet's exertions. Gary Snyder, in his <a href=\"http://www.poetryfoundation.org/archive/poem.html?id=\" 177249\" \">I Went Into the Maverick Bar</a>, turns his back on the workers he sees in the bar to return to what he sees as \"the real work\". I like the poem, but I'm not sure I can go all the way with the sentiment.<br> But now it's your turn to pick up the tools of this particular trade, and do some \"real work\" of your own. This week's challenge is for poems on the theme of work. Don't just sit there; get cracking.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/oil\">Oil</a> prices fell further today after the International Energy Agency cut its oil demand growth forecast for 2008 to the lowest rate in 15 years due to economic weakness and the banking crisis.</p> <p>Prices tumbled by almost $5 a barrel to a one-year low today amid growing fears that the deepening financial crisis will squash demand for fuel.</p> <p>In its monthly report, the IEA, adviser to 28 industrialised countries, reduced its demand growth forecast for this year by 250,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 440,000 bpd. This represents a 0.5% growth rate \u2013 the lowest in percentage terms since 1993.</p> <p>The report adds to evidence that slowing economies and the worsening financial crisis are reducing oil consumption.</p> <p>US light crude for November delivery fell to $81.82 a barrel this morning, taking its losses over the past two weeks to more than 23% \u2014 the biggest two-week sell-off since prices tumbled at the start of the 2003 war in Iraq. In London, Brent crude lost $3.58 to $78.36 a barrel, the first time in a year it has been below $80.</p> <p>Government intervention to bail out troubled banks and coordinated interest rate cuts by the world's major central banks have failed to calm markets. As Britain, the US and other countries are sliding into recession, analysts have revised down their targets for global demand for oil.</p> <p>Investors who piled into oil and other commodities earlier in the year as a hedge against inflation and the weak dollar are now cashing out in search of safer havens, such as gold.</p> <p>\"The oil market fall-out from credit issues leads us to become considerably more pessimistic about both short-term demand and medium- and long-term supply,\" said analysts at Barclays Capital.</p> <p>The IEA now expects world oil demand to average 86.5 million bpd in 2008. The agency also lowered its growth forecast for 2009 as well, cutting the prediction by 190,000 bpd to 690,000 bpd.</p> <p>The Paris-based agency said the impact of global economic weakness was most acute in developed countries while developing economies were showing \"a degree of resilience\".</p> <p>\"Although non-OECD slowdown is also likely, it is by no means certain that growth will be choked off altogether,\" it said. \"We have yet to see unambiguous evidence of a sharp slowdown in China, while Middle Eastern demand growth remains robust.\" </p> <p>Following calls from Opec ministers this week for action to halt the slide in oil prices, the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said it would hold an emergency meeting on November 18 in Vienna to discuss the impact of the financial crisis on the oil market.</p> <p>The IEA warned against too much focus on demand, saying the credit crisis would also impact investment in bringing on new oil supply. There are fears that Opec may cut its supplies to artificially keep oil prices higher.</p> <p>Drivers' groups yesterday accused <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/09/oil\">petrol retailers</a> of ripping off motorists by not lowering prices at the pumps despite oil having tumbled from its record high price level in July.</p> <p>But experts believe pump prices will fall in coming months as demand for fuel wanes in the face of recession fears and cutbacks on spending. Tesco today announced a 3p a litre cut.</p> <p><strong>Metals fatigued</strong></p> <p>Meanwhile, metal prices also dived as recession fears gripped investors. Copper tumbled by more than 9% to its lowest point since March 2006, while aluminium sank to its weakest level for nearly three years.</p> <p>Michael Lewis, strategist at Deutsche Bank, said the banking sector problems were now spilling over into other sectors and providing a forceful negative demand shock. \"Copper does look the most exposed,\" he said.</p> <p>Prices of the metal used in power and construction have fallen about 45% since a record high of $8,940 in July. </p> <p>Aluminium hit $2,190 a tonne, its lowest since December 2005. The metal used in transport and packaging has come under pressure in recent weeks after deteriorating car sales data from carmakers due to cash-strapped consumers. Nickel, lead and zinc all also suffered falls.</p> <p>Analysts are not expecting prices to recover quickly and predict they will flatline for some time.</p> <p>Many of those who had thought China, the world's largest consumer of copper and aluminium, would offset falling demand elsewhere have now revised that stance as signs emerge that the East Asian economy is being shaken by the global downturn.</p> <p>The only metal that continued to enjoy rises was gold, which is seen as a safe haven asset during times of economic meltdown. Prices of the precious metal jumped more than 4% to $925 an ounce.</p>",
  "<p>The UK economy is currently rocked by the global crisis in the financial markets. But looking beyond the daily dramas at the stock exchange, how can the UK and its cities - its hubs of business activity and job creation - bounce back?<br> Innovative businesses and workers have been at the heart of recent growth, from life sciences in Edinburgh and Cambridge to hi-tech engineering in Bristol and Derby. But even at a time of economic uncertainty cities need to continue to foster innovation and entrepreneurship to ensure they will be well-placed to attract businesses and generate high-value jobs in the future. Whilst not every city can emulate the success of places like Cambridge and Bristol, that doesn't mean their success stories have to be a one-off. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.centreforcities.org/innovation\">Research</a> published today by the <a href=\"http://www.centreforcities.org/\">Centre for Cities</a> highlights how supporting innovation is about more than science and technology \u2013 it's about getting the fundamentals right so businesses and workers can innovate and grow. </p> <p>Public sector enthusiasm for science and technology has seen a proliferation of policy measures designed to spur innovation. We've seen a growth of niche initiatives such as Science Cities and gimmicky science parks that don't address the real problems facing business. Cities have also developed numerous overlapping business support services. An innovative manufacturing firm looking to locate in Birmingham is faced with as many as 55 different business and innovation support initiatives across 29 organisations and partnerships in the city \u2013 navigating these takes up the firm's valuable time and resources.</p> <p>At the Centre for Cities, we think that the best way for local policymakers to attract and encourage innovation is to get the basics right \u2013 to make their city an attractive place to do business. That means prioritising investment in overstretched transport links so that innovative firms can reach out to wider customers and new markets without being held back by congestion.</p> <p>It means delivering affordable <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/housing\">housing</a> so that innovative cities like Cambridge and York can attract and keep the talented labour that new industries need. People moving to Cambridge must now invest nearly ten times their salary to afford a house in the city, compared with a national average of just over seven times.</p> <p>And it means that local authorities need to be responsive to business needs \u2013 smooth planning processes have enabled Reading to attract investment from high tech firms such as Microsoft and Cisco, creating jobs and growth in the local economy.</p> <p>To support UK cities in their efforts to recover from today's troubles in the financial markets and to better support existing and future innovation and entrepreneurship, policymakers in Whitehall, in the regions and in the UK's cities need to further rationalise the complicated web of innovation and business support services. And they need to focus on making cities more attractive places to do business \u2013 to attract and cultivate the James Dysons and Anita Roddicks of the future.</p> <p>\u2022 Hannah Brown is research manager of Centre for Cities research and policy institute</p>",

  "<p>With just three grands prix left in this year's title race, you'd expect the buzz to be about nothing more than <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/oct/08/lewis.hamilton.formula.one\">Lewis Hamilton and Felipe Massa</a>. In the past few days, however, we've heard <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/oct/08/formulaone.motorsports\">Max Mosley predicting the death of the sport unless it instigates an economy drive</a> and <a href=\"http://www.formula1.com/news/headlines/2008/10/8487.html\">Bridgestone pushing the environmental message via the ludicrous medium of green striped tyres</a>. The timing might be curious, but at last formula one is poking a toe outside its platinum-plated bubble.</p> <p>Grand prix racing has always been \u2014 and some would add 'gloriously' before the next two words \u2014 single-minded. Whether you believe it is for business, entertainment, marketing or the purely selfish addiction to speed, formula one exists for its own gain and rarely gives more than a second's thought to issues that may be bothering the rest of the population \u2014 however seismic they may be. You might argue this is entirely natural for a sport, and that it has no responsibility to care about anything other than its own existence. But, to put it crudely, this is a pursuit worth billions that parades around punching its own hole in the ozone layer (not just from the racing, but from the transport of kit and bodies across 17 countries too). Is it really a case of no conscience necessary?</p> <p>Mosley's claim that formula one will suffer a quick demise if costs aren't cut is common sense: sponsors and car manufacturers cannot justify astronomical budgets if they are simultaneously making employees redundant. The global economic downturn is certain to have implications for the sport \u2014 whether it is investors pulling out of teams and new circuits, or millions lost through bust Icelandic banks. No matter how deep its pockets, formula one is not immune to recession, although Mosley points out he was lecturing on the need to cut costs before the credit crunch took hold, as the sport was already trying to price itself out of existence.</p> <p>A meeting will take place after <a href=\"http://guardian.autosport.com/cp.php?l=0&amp;r=2008&amp;c=1\">the Chinese grand prix \u2014 the penultimate round of the season</a> \u2014 as the FIA and the newly resurrected Fota (Formula One Teams' Association) debate measures to help them weather the financial storm. There's been talk of standardised components, the easiest way to cut expenditure, with engines possibly on the menu. Not only could this protect grand prix racing, but increased competition is likely to improve the show, so let's hope that all the talk translates into action.</p> <p>As for Bridgestone's assertion that \"environmental preservation is at the centre of our work\", I would love to see how that claim is proven (I thought it was simply making profit from tyres). But although it's a joke to pretend that painting green lines on rubber constitutes a step on the road to environmental redemption, there are a few useful tips on the <a href=\"http://www.makecarsgreen.com/10-points.html\">FIA's Make Cars Green website</a>. However, whether you believe Massa always checks his tyre pressure before climbing in his car and Heikki Kovalainen never leaves the engine running to warm up in the Finnish chill is another matter.</p> <p>The real opportunity is if the two talking points are combined and formula one uses its tangible assets \u2014 technological know-how and marketing ability \u2014 to make a genuine step forward in environmentally friendly motoring. When the car giants are using their sporting programmes to develop ideas that filter down to road cars, as we can hope the planned 2010 introduction of Kers (Kinetic Energy Recovery Systems) will, then the expenditure becomes admissible. They just need to prove that they're not only trying to save their own skin but have grown an environmental conscience, too.</p> <h2>Last weekend's action</h2> <p>Is Allan McNish driving better than any other racer in the world this year? That's the view of one colleague who's been lobbying me to give the Scotsman some of the credit he deserves.

Granted, it was a mistake to shunt the R10 on the way to the grid and miss the start, but he redeemed the error in mind-boggling fashion, passing all and sundry to take the flag. Stunning.</p> <h2>This weekend's action</h2> <p>In the recent years, the British F3 International championship couldn't claim to be the hot bed of talent or excitement it once was, but 2008 has been different. <a href=\"http://guardian.autosport.com/cp.php?d=46&amp;c=0\">The finale at Donington this weekend</a> will be the culmination of an intriguing battle of nationalities as Oliver Turvey (Britain), Jaime Alguersuari (Spain) and Brendon Hartley (New Zealand) settle the dispute.

  "<p>Ricky Ponting's professional catharsis during the first innings of the ongoing Australia v India Test match in Bangalore arrived in stages. Some moments stood out. With his score on 68, and having recently passed his highest Test score in India, Ponting faced a fresh over from Harbhajan Singh, the bowler who has tormented him on these trips. The sixth ball was Harbahjan's variation: flatter and zipping away off the pitch. Ponting planted his pad in line with off stump and let it go. He looked up with wide eyes. Harbahjan just stared. Even watching on television, you felt it: this was one of the game's more poignant dot balls.</p> <p>The kind of delivery that, during his miserable series of 2001, might have had Ponting cartwheeling into his own stumps had been simply dealt with. Seven years in the making, it was a lovely moment. This was sport in its pure form: a vertiginous confrontation of technique, skill and character. It was a Test cricket kind of moment, too: gently, incrementally constructed, dizzyingly subtle. And it was a pretty good leave.</p> <p>Right now it's tempting to hoard moments like these. You guzzle them greedily, with a sense that there might actually be a limit on how much of this there is still to come. More than most sports, Test cricket has always had an air of the protected species about it: heritage-stamped, regally ossified and continually under threat from the deeply worrying forces of the new. As far as Test cricket goes, the world has been ending for some time now. Still, you do wonder occasionally. And if excitement about the current series in India has a slightly fevered edge to it, this might be with good reason. </p> <p>The most commonly mooted murder weapon in the premature demise of Test cricket has been the one-day game. Concern has surrounded the enduring appetite of the watching public for the more attritional charms of the longer form. So far so good. Test cricket has hung in there. The last few years have brought the fresh challenge of Twenty20. With it comes a threat to something more fundamental, even, than spectators. This time it's the players. </p> <p>The start of a potentially thrilling Test series in India seems like a good moment to reflect on this. Already it seems that Twenty20, through the IPL and assorted kindred tournaments, is closer to a separate form of the game. It is both aggressive and expansionist. It doesn't need Test cricket. It doesn't need the longer form at all. And intentionally or not, it's going some way towards persuading the people who play the game that they don't either. </p> <p>Battle has already been joined on this front. The prize money for winning next year's County championship has been raised to \u00a3500,000. Which is still \u00a350,000 less than England's players can earn in a single Twenty20 match next month. Elsewhere players of the calibre of Loots Bosman and Dilhara Fernando have been guaranteed earnings of $450,000 over three years by their employers in the IPL, a competition that lasts just 44 days. </p> <p>There are some serious career choices to be made here, and it would be impossibly na\u00efve to imagine these kind of forces will fail to exert a violent gravitational pull. As usual Test cricket looks most vulnerable. The standard line is still that Test matches remain the pinnacle of the playing calendar. To date, no international player has broken ranks on this, at least not overtly. </p> <p>Which brings us back to the current series. The last time these two teams played, Andrew Symonds was Australia's equal top run scorer. Symonds isn't in India now. He might be back, he might not. He will, however continue to earn $1.47m playing for Hyderabad in the IPL. Symonds hasn't retired from playing Test cricket to concentrate on the shorter, much more lucrative game (in fact the IPL's co-founder Lalit Modi has urged him not to). It just looks a bit like that. </p> <p>What is certain is that Test cricket is weakened by his absence. As it is by the absence of 13 Bangladeshi cricketers now banned from playing for their country due to ICL commitments. The notion of a weakened Bangladesh Test team might sound like something of a tautology \u2013 even a philosophical impossibility \u2013 but this is still a serious blow. A lot of effort has been poured into nurturing Test cricket's most recent full member. A significant amount has been undone by the lure of a second rate sub-continental Twenty20 beano. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/oct/10/srilankacricketteam-indianpremierleague\">This morning's announcement that Sri Lankan Cricket is entering into cahoots with the BCCI</a> to commit their best players to the IPL and Champions League at the expense of Test cricket is the strongest indication yet of the shifting priorities in the game. </p> <p>Which brings us back again to the current series. Both India and Australia are, we're told, in transition. India's epic middle order is in the process of being dismantled: Sourav Ganguly has already announced he will retire after the Australia series. This has been a great Test batting line-up. Who knows, we may never see a middle order like it again. </p> <p>Partly because there seems little doubt that many young, talented cricketers are already spending their time developing techniques other than the expert leave or the 12-over spell of probing line and length. The fast hands and unorthodox feet movement that permit the hoiked six off a full ball; the unerring medium-pace yorker: these are some seriously lucrative skills. </p> <p>And if young cricketers aren't focusing their ambitions, at least partially, on the financial rewards of Twenty20, you feel like asking: why not? It seems illogical not to. Sir Allen Stanford has already spoken about setting up two youth academies in the West Indies, one for the first class game; another for Twenty20 and one-day skills. It's an idea others may follow. If you were 13 years old which one would you like to be packed off to? </p> <p>Which brings us back, again, to the current series. Mahendra Singh Dhoni is keeping wicket for India in Bangalore. Dhoni is world cricket's biggest star right now. To the blinkered, Test-centric eye, this might seem anomalous. Dhoni is a good wicket-keeper. His Test batting average is decent: better than Mark Boucher, worse than Matt Prior (both have one Test hundred). But in the one-day game Dhoni's skills are remarkable, his presence thrilling. Dhoni doesn't really need Test Matches. And he's cricket's biggest star - as well as its most charismatic role model. </p> <p>It's sometimes easy to adopt the position that any kind of change is change for the worse. And Test cricket has been through choppy waters before. Australia and India were also playing each other 19 years ago when the first of Kerry Packer's World Series Cricket Super Test series was being staged. At the time the Guardian warned that the Australian board was \"faced with declining profits and shattered morale among its players\". One headline warned: \"cricket itself lies bleeding\". Before the first Packer Test our correspondent wrote of wickets being \"readied for the funeral of cricket as we know it\". Henry Blofeld, no less, opined that: \"the traditional cricket world has already been shattered\".</p> <p>And so it had, although Test cricket did survive and even flourished. In fact, one of the positive effects of that particular upheaval was the forcible blooding of a generation of new talent. England's depleted tour of Pakistan saw fresh faces Mike Brearley, Mike Gatting, Ian Botham and Paul Downton in the front rank. For Pakistan the young Javed Miandad was recalled, a player who would, in his time, become Pakistan's greatest Test batsman.</p> <p>Which brings us back, finally, to the current series in India. These are undeniably exciting times in the ICC's cyclical Test match itinerary. India play Pakistan next. Australia will soon play South Africa home and away. And then there's next summer's Ashes series in England. Test cricket has no greater riches than these. Ponting's triumphant first day in Bangalore signalled the start of what is effectively an uninterrupted 11-month global march-past by the five-day game. Enjoy it while you can. Go on, gorge yourself. After all, it's not totally clear - not yet anyway - what might be coming along next.</p>",
  "<p>In all the shouting about who's to blame for the financial meltdown \u2013 Hank Paulson, derivatives traders, fat cat CEOs, John McCain (if you're Barack Obama), Obama (if you're McCain) \u2013 we are not hearing a single thing about the Rolling Stones.</p> <p>So they're a rock band. They are not solely or even primarily culpable. But they are involved. When the Stones <a href=\"http://www.allbusiness.com/marketing-advertising/4154824-1.html\">accepted sponsorship for their 2005 US tour from AmeriQuest</a>, one of the country's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ameriquest_Mortgage\">largest sub-prime mortgage lenders</a>, they joined the effort that moved millions of people toward financial and personal ruin, a disaster underlying the ongoing national/global/intergalactic credit crisis. Among their slogans: \"AmeriQuest: Not your average mortgage company. Rolling Stones? Not your average garage band.\" </p> <p>That AmeriQuest wasn't the average mortgage company is demonstrably true (unlike so much of what was said to its hopeful borrowers): AmeriQuest was far more unethical and loathsome than the average mortgage company. Mick Jagger has of course been caught in bed with scores of headline-worthy companions, but AmeriQuest has to have been the least attractive. Sympathy for the Devil? How about deals with the Devil? When the Stones accepted AmeriQuest's sponsorship, in May 2005, the lending company was already under investigation from coast to coast for fraud and unfair business practices that had devastated countless lives. In August that year it <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/business/articles/2005/07/29/ameriquest_sets_aside_325m_for_settlement/\">agreed to pay $325m to settle an investigation</a> by a task force of attorney generals, on top of previous multimillion-dollar settlements. </p> <p>We should have known we were heading into the end days. The street fighting men taking money from <em>them</em>? That deal placed the Stones, those former icons of the counterculture, in the same category as any Wall Street or government big shot whose ambition was enrichment at the expense of people with far less - in the band's case, its own fans. The stage, television and internet promotions, which didn't mention AmeriQuest's sub-prime status, <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2005/oct/31/business/fi-ameriquest31\">aimed to familiarise Rolling Stones fans with the company's name</a> so that they responded to direct mailings. \"The 'open rate' goes sky high when you put the Stones logo on the envelope,\" said Kevin Morefield, then the company's executive vice-president for strategic planning. </p> <p>The Stones potentially gave AmeriQuest access to millions more borrowers. \"In today's saturated marketplace,\" Brian Woods, the company's CMO, <a href=\"http://www.rollingstones.com/news/press.php?uid=275\">said at the time</a>, \"the Rolling Stones break through the clutter to reach fans in a way that few iconic brands can. \u2026 [T]his tour allows AmeriQuest the opportunity to reach those fans by fulfilling their dream to see the Stones on stage live.\" AmeriQuest was big on dreams. It styled itself the \"proud sponsor of the American dream\" when what was needed was a sponsor of American reality.</p> <p>It wasn't just about the mortgages. Any big-name concert draws fans into a financial dream world. A couple of tickets for $250 each, another hundred and a half on irresistible logo swag (sweatshirts, hats, pirate paraphernalia, whatever), plus dinner, transport and babysitting, and Stones fans in 2005 might have been in for a grand \u2013 enough to have a picket fence erected around the house they would soon buy with a sub-prime loan. </p> <p>AmeriQuest dished out the most valuable Stones tickets to powerful recipients whose sympathies the company sought. That included politicians such as <a href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2005/08/11/MNGVCE66GH1.DTL\">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bloggingstocks.com/2007/12/31/does-ameriquests-campaign-cash-tie-bush-to-the-subprime-mortgag/\">legislators</a> in at least seven states \u2013 part of the sub-prime industry's lobbying for laxer laws to facilitate ever more predatory loan practices. The Rolling Stones were not the only ones who sold themselves to this cause. AmeriQuest also sponsored professional baseball and football, car racing and Paul McCartney (his 2005 SuperBowl performance), and was a major cash donor to both Democrats and (more so) Republicans. Former employees have given sworn testimonies relating to AmeriQuest's tactics and methods with the less privileged \u2013 their customers \u2013 which included concealing interest-rate terms and fees, forging documents and fabricating incomes. The hundreds of millions the company paid out in settlements pales in comparison to its profits. </p> <p>AmeriQuest's mortgage services were shut down when it was acquired by Citigroup in 2007. It leaves a nation ravaged by short sales, foreclosures and worthless mortgage-backed investments, along with crowds of desolate Stones fans (among plenty of others) who thought they owned a home. Hey, you can't always get what you want. They're back in low-end rentals or crashing on sofas, the radios still crackling with Jagger's prescient lyrics: \"Please allow me to introduce myself, I'm a man of wealth and taste, I've been around for a long, long year, Stole many a man's soul and faith. \u2026 Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name.\"</p>",
  "<p>In his new, bestselling book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Hot-Flat-Crowded-Revolution-America/dp/0374166854\">Hot, Flat and Crowded: Why We Need a Green Revolution \u2014 and How It Can Renew America</a>, New York Times columnist Thomas L. Friedman describes a world in trouble. With climate change, globalization, and overpopulation, he argues, the central challenge to humanity has now become \"to manage what is already unavoidable and avoid what will truly be unmanageable.\"</p> <p>In an exclusive interview for Yale Environment 360, Friedman spoke with New Yorker staff writer Elizabeth Kolbert about the need for an energy technology revolution \u2014 a revolution he believes should be led by the United States. The three-time Pulitzer Prize winner told Kolbert that energy technology must be the next great global industry and that \"the country that leads that industry is going to have the most national security, economic security, innovative companies and global respect.\"</p> <p>During the 40-minute interview, Friedman talked about everything from Washington and China to E.O. Wilson and Barack Obama, and he dismissed calls for the U.S. to develop more fossil fuels (\"drill, baby, drill\") by noting, \"There's only one mantra for America, and that's 'Innovate, baby, innovate.'\"</p> <p>Friedman spoke with Kolbert from his office in Washington, D.C.</p> <p><strong>Elizabeth Kolbert</strong>: You've written extensively both about global terrorism and global warming, and you talk in the book about the difference in the American response to these both very, very scary problems. Why do think there is such a big difference? Why the war on terror and sort of a shrug on global warming?</p> <p><strong>Thomas Friedman</strong>: I guess it's a couple things. One is that the war on terror could be personified in the face and person of Osama Bin Laden or the 9/11 hijackers, and I think that's very important for getting people focused on a threat. It could be manifested in immediacy, literally, in the downing of the Twin Towers and the attack on the Pentagon. There was a clear and present danger people felt.</p> <p>Thomas Friedman: \"It's unlike any challenge I think we've ever seen.\"<br>Now I'll just contrast that with climate change. The enemy is a gas called carbon dioxide that you can't see, touch or smell. So there's no personification basically. The effects at the moment tend to be diffuse and hard to see, unless you normally travel through the Arctic Circle during summer.</p> <p>And finally, the biggest impacts, as we understand them, will fall on people who haven't been born yet. And getting people, our generation, to take decisive action on a kind of 9/11 scale in response to a problem you can't see, touch or smell, that will impact most profoundly on people who haven't been born yet, is a real challenge in stewardship.</p> <p>And it's unlike any challenge I think we've ever seen.</p> <p>Kolbert: As you point out, global warming is a really, really hard issue and, as we just talked about, a multigenerational issue that requires really smart, focused leadership over the course of many years.</p> <p>Friedman: That's right.</p> <p>Kolbert: Don't these two facts sort of point you to the reaction that Dave Letterman gave you the other night, when he just sort of blurted out, \"We are so screwed?\"</p> <p>Friedman: Right. This book in many ways \u2014 what I tell people when I speak about it now to audiences \u2014 is that it masquerades as a book about energy and the environment. But it's really just a masquerade. It's really a book about America.</p> <p>And energy/environment is almost like an allegory I use to talk about our ability anymore to face a big, multigenerational problem in a serious, fixed, focused and sustained way... One of the challenges, and I don't have to tell you this, is that if you tell people, \"We're just completely toast, we're fried, we're cooked.\" They say, \"Well, if that's the case, let's party.\" And if you say, \"No, no, no, no, no. No, we can actually do this. If we get our act together, we can do this.\" And they say, \"Oh, we can do this? Well, let's party.\"</p> <p>So the problem is, either way people want to just party, and finding that kind of happy medium where people understand the immediacy and seriousness of starting now, and at the same time aren't paralyzed by the enormity of the task.</p> <p>That's why I end the book, I love Donella Meadows' line, \"We have exactly enough time, starting now.\" You know?</p> <p>Kolbert: Yeah, that's a great line.</p> <p>Friedman: I kind of live by that mantra. Because I always tell people, pessimists are usually right. Let's face it. Optimists are usually wrong. But all the great change in history, positive change, was done by optimists.</p> <p>So what I've really tried to do in my own politics and in this book is really two things: One, is basically to say, well, if the world is getting hot, flat and crowded, what does that mean? It means that these five big problems are the next big problems of the 21st century \u2014 energy, natural resources supply and demand, petro-dictatorship, climate change, biodiversity loss, and energy poverty. What does that list mean? That means the next great global industry has to be \u2014 energy technology. The production of abundant, cheap, clean reliable electrons through a combination of innovation, energy efficiency, and conservation.</p> <p>Well, if that's the next great global industry, then it means that the country that leads that industry is going to have the most national security, economic security, innovative companies, and I think global respect. And my point is, simply, that country has to be the United States of America.</p> <p>Kolbert: You talk in the book about how crucial it is to put the right regulatory policies in place, to encourage the development of clean energy sources. But you always hear, and I'm sure you always hear it when you go out into the U.S., that anything that we do, that China, say, isn't doing, puts us at a competitive disadvantage. So how do you answer those folks?</p> <p>Friedman: Well I answer that really with a story I tell in the book. Last year, I was invited to the China Clean Car Conference. China has a clean car conference \u2014 who knew? \u2014 in Tianjin, China, their kind-of Detroit, kind of a rather grimy city, the Marriott Tianjin.</p> <p>And, I was the closing speaker. The audience was all Chinese car guys. All kind of grizzled Chinese car guys, all listening to me \u2014 nobody spoke English, they were all listening on headsets through an interpreter. And I thought, \"What do I tell these guys?\" And so, my basic message was this: \"Guys,\" \u2014 it was only guys \u2014 \"guys, I have got to tell you, every time I come to China young Chinese say to me, 'Mr. Friedman, you guys got to grow dirty for 150 years. Now it's our turn.' And my message to you, on behalf of all Americans, is to tell you, 'You're right. It's your turn.</p> <p>All the great change in history, positive change, was done by optimists.\"</p> <p>Grow as dirty as you want.' Because I think we just need about five years now to invent all the clean-power technologies you're going to need as you choke to death, and we're going to come over, and we're going to sell them all to you. And we're going to clean your clock. I don't know how you say that in Chinese, we're going to clean your clock in the next great global industry. So, please, if you want to give me a five-year lead, I'd love five. I'd prefer 10. Take your time. Because we are going to clean your clock in the next great global industry.\"</p> <p>Now it takes about 30 seconds for the translation to get through \u2014 and that's when you see everyone adjusting their headsets, eyes lighting up \u2014 and then about one second for them to understand exactly what I'm saying: That they basically have a choice. They can do what they did on telephony, which was to go from no phones to cellphones, and skip landlines, and they can do that in clean power\u2026 But unless they really change, they're going to miss the new IT, which is ET.</p> <p>And so they can sit back and say, \"This is unfair. You guys ate the hors d'oeuvres, you ate the entr\u00e9e, and you invite us for dessert and ask us to split the bill. We're not going to do that.\" And I understand, I say, \"I know why you're pissed. I'd be pissed, too. But I'm here to tell you, this is the next great global industry in a world that's hot, flat and crowded, it has to be.\"</p> <p>Kolbert: Now, have you delivered that to an American audience? What kind of response do you get?</p> <p>Friedman: They all kind of get it. But I just tell you, parenthetically, it's been amazing... I had 8,000 people come to hear me at Miami of Ohio, in the basketball stadium, 4,200 in Purdue, 3,000 at Ohio State. I've had crowds I never had before. I'd like to think it's about me. It's not. And this is not false modesty. People are desperate for someone to point them out and forward in a way. And they're just so hungry\u2026 But they also want to know, \"What can I do?\"</p> <p>Kolbert: You have an interesting passage in the book, where you talk about how in a campaign, a candidate might frame an energy tax, I think you talk about a gasoline tax. Can you talk about that?</p> <p>Friedman: Politicians will always say, \"If I do this, my opponent will hit me on taxes.\" And I say, well, let's just think about this. Let's imagine I'm the pro-green candidate, and Elizabeth Kolbert is the pro-nontax candidate. And I come out and I say I'm for a gasoline tax and you say, \"There goes my opponent, Mr. Friedman.\" Just like Sarah Palin you would say, \"He's never seen a tax he didn't like. And now he wants to come to Wassila, Alaska, and tax your gasoline?\"</p> <p>I'd say, \"Let's get one thing straight. My opponent and I, we're both for a tax. Because if you don't think what OPEC oil cartel is doing to the real price of oil isn't an artificial price, isn't in effect a tax, then you're not paying attention. So we're both for a tax. I'd just prefer my taxes go to the U.S. Treasury to fund U.S. schools, U.S. roads, U.S. highways, U.S. research, U.S. innovation. It's just a little tic I have, that I like my tax dollars to build my country, not Saudi Arabia, Iran, or Kuwait, or Abu Dhabi, or Dubai, or Russia or Venezuela\u2026 My opponent is indifferent where your tax dollars go.\" If you can't win that debate, you don't belong in politics.</p> <p>Kolbert: Right, but of course if we look at what we've actually seen over the last few months, it's \"Drill, baby, drill.\"</p> <p>Friedman: Absolutely. And that, as I've written and been saying, that is just so stupid. I mean, it is as if on the eve of the IT revolution, on the eve of the birth of the Internet and the PC, we are out there pounding the table for more IBM Selectric typewriters. Carbon paper, baby, carbon paper! That's nuts. There's only one mantra for America, and that's \"Innovate, baby, innovate!\"</p> <p>Kolbert: You had a column the other day which I thought skirted pretty close to an endorsement there.</p> <p>Friedman: Yes\u2026 you noticed!</p> <p>Kolbert: But do you actually like Barack Obama's energy plan or is it just better than \"Drill, baby, drill?\"</p> <p>Friedman: I think it's just, right now, better than \"Drill, baby, drill.\" I give Obama credit for generally leaning in favor of all the right things. And not falling off the wagon on things like \"Drill, baby, drill\" or on lifting the federal gasoline tax in the summer. And he did vote in favor three times for the renewable energy and production investment tax credits.</p> <p>McCain missed all eight votes. He came out for lifting the gasoline tax in the summer, which was just a stunt that would have simply added more driving, more CO2 to the atmosphere, and pushed up the price of oil. And then he came up with \"Drill, baby, drill.\"</p> <p>So, to me, basically there's a clear, clear choice. Now there's only one green candidate. It is Barack Obama.</p> <p> If you don't have an ethic of conservation, you basically have a license to drive a Hummer through the Amazon.\"</p> <p>Would I like Obama to make the things I'm passionate about more central to his identity and his campaign, rather just another spoke in the wheel? There's health care, there's green technology, there's new roads, there's education, there's Iraq. Yes, to me, it's the center. It's not another spoke. But, you have to ride whatever horse you got. And right now he's all we got. And he's a lot better than the other guy. And so I ride.</p> <p>Kolbert: Can you talk about the media's role in all this. I mean, what do you think of the job that we all have done?</p> <p>Friedman: You know, it's such a hard issue. I'm a big believer, to name something is to own it. And if you can name an issue, you can own an issue: \"The World is Flat.\" And that's why I spend a lot of time naming things. And trying to find ways to convey enormous complexity in a very simple way. And one of the things, and I've said this before, that's always struck me about the green movement, is that it was actually named by its opponents. They own the definition... Because they named it liberal, tree-hugging, sissy, girly-man, unpatriotic, vaguely French.</p> <p>And the whole purpose of my book is to redefine green. To redefine it as a geo-political, geo-strategic, geo-economic, patriotic. Green is the new red, white and blue.</p> <p>Kolbert: But as you also discuss, there's a real reason to be afraid that even unlimited clean energy is not going to save the planet, in fact quite possibly it would just accelerate biodiversity.</p> <p>Friedman: Well, bless your heart\u2026 You're one of the few people who've picked up on that. You know.</p> <p>Nobody gets the conservation part of the triad \u2014 that if you don't have an ethic of conservation, you basically have a license to drive a Hummer through the Amazon.</p> <p>I tell you, it goes back to your Barack Obama question. Why am I still hanging in there with him? Because I believe, once elected, he has the potential \u2014 the potential \u2014 to really be a transformational figure on this issue, if he wants to be\u2026 The president of the United States' bully pulpit is unlike any other in the world. And what we have lost sight of, because we've forgotten what it would be like to have a president who \u2014 unlike the current one who cannot choke the word c-c-c-c-c-conservation out of his mouth \u2014 what it would be like to have a president who on inauguration day gives his inaugural speech and then hops on a bicycle, and bikes to the White House.</p> <p>Kolbert: That's a great idea.</p> <p>Friedman: And that's what I'm going to propose, if this guy wins. You and Michelle ride your bike from the Capitol steps to the White House. Do you know what happens the next day? A hundred thousand bicycles are sold in America. The people forget the symbolic and rhetorical power of the president of the United States\u2026 We've forgotten, you know, because we've had this troll who comes out once a week now and tells us the economy's OK. And Dick Cheney, when was the last time you ever heard him speak to anybody? I mean, who would know?</p> <p>Kolbert: You talk to an amazing array of very smart people, the people we would all like to talk to, from John Holdren to E. O Wilson. If you had to pick, and maybe this is unfair, but something that someone said to you that really got you thinking about things in a new way, and that you'd point people towards, what would that be?</p> <p>Friedman: You know, you mention E.O. Wilson, and Ed Wilson is just one of the great treasures of America. And he said something that really struck me. And I'm not going to get it exactly right, but he basically said,</p> <p> We're only going to innovate our way out of this problem. This is not a problem for regulators, it's for engineers.\"</p> <p>\"Nature is regulating our climate for free. Mother Nature, she's been doing that for free, for a long, long time. Now do you really want to get in there and do geo-engineering and all this kind of stuff? Well, if you don't want to do that, then we need to get out of Mother Nature's way. Because do you want to be turning the dials and pulling the levers and think we can do that better than Mother Nature?\" I don't think so. And it is a very, very powerful point.</p> <p>Kolbert: One of the themes of the book and explicit messages of the book obviously is the importance of making advances in clean-energy technologies, so you write, and I quote, \"Incremental breakthroughs are all we've had, but exponential is what we desperately need.\"</p> <p>Friedman: Yes.</p> <p>Kolbert: Can you just talk a little bit about what you mean by that?</p> <p>Friedman: I went to Bali last year\u2026 It really was an epiphany for me, because I just sort of looked around, I looked at the process and I said the following to myself: We're not going to regulate our way out of this problem. We're only going to innovate our way out of this problem. This is not a problem for regulators, it's for engineers. Because, my attitude basically is that I'm not against Bali, and Kyoto - if you can get 190 countries all to agree and implement verifiable reductions and limits on their CO2 emissions, may God bless you and keep you. But I don't want to hostage my future and my kids' future to that necessity.</p> <p>And so I'm trying to change the model here. I'm trying to say, let's make America the leader, the country that demonstrably grows richer, more innovative, more energy secure, more economically secure, more nationally secure, and more respected, by taking the lead in the green revolution. I am absolutely convinced more people will follow us, by emulation, than will ever do under Kyoto, what we expect them to do by compulsion.</p> <p>Kolbert: But you also write, and you know that real energy innovation is hard.</p> <p>Friedman: That's right. Our nose is pressed right now against the boundaries of physics, and chemistry and biology. And that's why so much of what we need to do is just push out that boundary. Because only in the arbitrage between all those disciplines will we find, I think, the real breakthrough.</p> <p>Kolbert: But what makes you think that breakthrough is out there?</p> <p>Friedman: I do. I really do. Here's the upside of the book tour I've been on. Every stop I come home with a pocketful of business cards. Because all these people come up to me with their energy companies that they started \u2014 solar, wind, cellulosic. \"I've got a duck that paddles a wheel, blows up a balloon, the balloon issues methane, burns fuel, turns a turbine\u2026\" You hear the craziest stuff, but everyone's trying. And so I'm a big believer in the wisdom of crowds here.</p> <p>Kolbert: You had another great fact in the book, which I did not know, which was that green was the single-most trademarked term in 2007, and you go on to point out that a lot of the ways in which green is used is [the idea that] green should be easy. But the fact of the matter is there is no easy way to be green. I mean, if it's easy, it's not green.</p> <p>Friedman: That's right.</p> <p>Kolbert: I though that was a very good point. Of course people, as you point out, we don't like hard things. That, I suppose, is the $64 trillion question\u2026 But can green be sold as something hard? Can it be sold politically with the acknowledgement that it's hard?</p> <p>Friedman: The way I try to sell it is that it's something big, it's aspirational, it's about national security. That it's not just about electric power, it's about national power.</p> <p>Kolbert: You had a column the other day titled \"Green the Bailout.\" What do you mean by that?</p> <p>Friedman: Well, from \"The World is Flat,\" one of the things I was keenly aware of is the importance of bubbles. It was actually the railroad bubble back in the 19th century that all these people went in, bought railroad stocks, and built railroads \u2014 most of them actually lost money. But what they left behind was the national railroad system.</p> <p>The dot.com boom bubble bust \u2014 you know, people went out, bought dot.coms, most people lost money, some people made money, but what they left behind was a national Internet bandwidth highway. And unfortunately now we're going through a financial system or industry bubble \u2014 and what it's leaving behind is</p> <p> People are desperate for someone to point them out and forward in a way. And they're just so hungry.\"</p> <p>bunch of dead derivatives, empty condos in Florida, and Gulf Stream jets that the mega-rich can't afford anymore. It will be a tragedy, and what makes it even worse, we borrowed a lot of it from China, and we didn't borrow \u2014 we put it on our kids' Visa cards. And so if we're going to do this mega-bailout we have got to make sure we are laying the foundations with it of another great industrial revolution.</p> <p>Kolbert: Here's my last question. In the process of writing the book, did you become more or less hopeful about the prospects for a world that's hot, flat and crowded.</p> <p>Friedman: I'm from Minnesota. I'm optimistic. I mean, that's just who I am.</p> <p>Kolbert: Yeah, you call yourself a sober optimist.</p> <p>Friedman: Right. But I'm more sober, you know, but I am still an optimist. I've had the opportunity to talk to Bill Gates a lot about this and the previous book. And Bill's kind of, I would say, an innovation determinist. He believes innovation can, will and must solve every problem. And maybe I'm not quite there yet, but I lean on his side of the debate than the other side. And as long as I have breath issuing forth from this body, yeah, that's where I'm going to put my time and energy.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was shared by <a href=\"http://e360.yale.edu\">Yale Environment 360</a>, a member of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/network\">Guardian Environment Network</a></p>",

  "<p>A poorly performing UK state school is proposing to open fee-charging branches in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zimbabwe, it has been revealed</p> <p>The City Academy Bristol would be the first state school to set up offshoots in other countries.</p> <p>The move is being promoted by Anthony Seldon, head of the independent Wellington College, which is also planning to open a number of foreign branches. </p> <p>Seldon is hosting at conference on opening international branches of private schools at Wellington tomorrow, where he will tell heads of state-funded schools that they should follow suit. </p> <p>Ray Priest, the head teacher of the City Academy Bristol, which is part of the National Challenge scheme for schools with low results, said opening branded schools overseas would help to establish his academy as a \"global educational establishment\". </p> <p>Priest said there was a possibility the branch schools would charge fees but that they would be \"appropriate\" to their local area. </p> <p>\"The motive for us would not be profit, as it is for some of the private schools,\" he said. \"It would create opportunities for staff and pupils to learn a great deal from each other.\" </p> <p>The City Academy Bristol is in the National Challenge scheme, which has threatened to close any school in which fewer than 30 per cent of pupils achieve five good GCSEs, including English and maths.</p> <p>Acknowledging his school's poor performance, Priest said it would concentrate on hitting the National Challenge threshold before looking to open branches overseas. The situation could \"get moving\" by 2010, he said.</p> <p>The academy already has links with the Democratic Republic of Congo - one of its football coaches is a relative of the country's education minister. And it already has a partnership with a school just outside Harare in Zimbabwe. One option under consideration is renaming and rebranding that school and Priest is hoping to visit next year to discuss the plans in more detail. </p> <p>No public money would be used to establish foreign branches, he stressed. \"We are a state school but being an academy we are independent. That means we have the freedom to follow these kinds of opportunities,\" he said. </p> <p>Priest added that City Academy Bristol was a sponsored school and \"as long as we can make a case for it, our sponsors will listen\". He said he had discussed his plans with the academy's sponsors and expected progress to be made within the next two years. </p> <p>Priest said that successful state schools should follow the example of private schools, which have already opened branches in China, Thailand and Kazakhstan. </p> <p>Seldon said he was aware that a number of overseas governments were keen to for \"prestigious and high-achieving\" British schools to start up in their countries. </p> <p>\"I see no reason why that cannot include state schools. Establishing schools in other countries would create wonderful opportunities for these schools and I encourage them to consider doing it,\" he said. </p> <p>Harrow is already operating schools in Thailand and China, while Dulwich College has three schools in China \u2013 in Beijing, Shanghai and Suzhou, north-west of Shanghai. </p> <p>Graham Able, the master of Dulwich, wants to open up to 10 schools around the world. This would generate funds for means-tested bursaries to enable children to attend the school's main London campus. </p> <p>Able wants to create \"needs-blind\" admissions , where pupils are awarded places irrespective of their ability to pay.</p>",
  "<p>Bestselling author <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2006/may/30/water.frontpagenews\">Philip Pullman</a> today called for a property company to give up trying to develop an historic <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/aug/09/books.booksnews\">Oxford canal boatyard</a> into luxury flats after a public inquiry inspector rejected its plans as \"sterile\" and \"uninspiring\".</p> <p>The author of His Dark Materials trilogy called for a totally different style of development of the Castle Mill site, which was the inspiration for the boat-dwelling Gyptians in the His Dark Materials trilogy. One of the books was turned into a Hollywood film The Golden Compass last year.</p> <p>A government planning inspector Ava Wood on Wednesday declined to overrule Oxford city council's refusal to allow Spring Residential to build 54 luxury flats. She said the design impacted badly on the adjoining Italianate St Barnabas church, which is mentioned in works by Sir John Betjeman, Evelyn Waugh and Thomas Hardy. Furthermore, she said, the nearest alternative boatyard was far away.</p> <p>\"This decision probably makes it almost impossible to build luxury flats there. But it does not guarantee the survival of the boatyard,\" said Pullman. \"A group now hopes to buy it. In effect, Spring have a site that they cannot develop. They have spent millions. The ideal situation now would be for a fairy godmother to appear with a pot of gold and make over the site to a trust.\" </p> <p>He said that he and others wanted to see the site around the 160-year-old canal boat repair yard developed into social housing and workshops. </p> <p>Castle Mill in the Jericho district of central Oxford is the last public boatyard on the Oxford canal and was essential to the 120 families who live on boats in Oxford. Opponents barricaded themselves into the boatyard to stop bailiffs clearing the site in 2005 but were eventually evicted by British Waterways, which owns the site.</p> <p>The battle for the Jericho yard has been described as a fight for the \"soul\" of Oxford. This was the second public inquiry which has refused permission for luxury housing on the site. Another property company, Bellway Homes, was refused planning permission to develop the site in 2005. Spring is believed to have bought the site for around \u00a34m.</p> <p>Pullman told the first inquiry: \"The boatyard and its work is part of a complex human ecology that sustains all kinds of life: economic life, artistic life, social life, environmental life, cultural life in the widest possible sense. It's part of what has made Oxford the incomparably fertile place it is, a place where the imagination can take root and flourish. It takes centuries to build up this rich soil.\"</p> <p>But the developers said yesterday that they would continue with their plans. \"We will consider the comments made by the inspector on design and boating facilities and will be revising the scheme to incorporate these comments. Revised plans will be prepared, consulted upon and submitted in due course,\" said a spokesman for Spring Residential. </p> <p>Peter Strong, chairman of the Jericho Living Heritage Trust, which is coordinating finances for the campaign to buy the yard from Spring Residential, added: \"We realise the time for protesting is over now and what we require is some very gentle negotiation with Spring Residential to acquire the site.\"</p>",

  "<p>Should London be picking a fight with Reykjavik, home of Sporticus*, the children's TV hero (of whom more later), at the height of a global financial crisis? I think not. Nationalism, not nationalisation, is the worry that should keep us awake at night now.<br><br>So Whitehall's move - and Gordon Brown's bellicose tone - smack of unnecessary British unilateralism at a time when international cooperation is vital. It also smacks of bullying a small neighbour, its 300,000 population about that of Cardiff. </p> <p>More than that, the use of the 2001 Anti-Terrorism Act to freeze \u00a34bn worth of assets of the failed Landsbanki on Wednesday night strikes many lawyers \u2013 diplomats too, I hope \u2013 as wrong, an abuse of process and power. No wonder Iceland's prime minister and new 24/7 TV star, Geir Haarde, is offended.</p> <p>It will probably all be sorted out quickly enough, though anyone old enough to remember Britain's protracted cod wars with Iceland \u2013 they ran for 20 years into the mid-70s \u2013 should not bank (bank?) on an easy resolution. </p> <p>Iceland was determined to extend its territorial waters to 200 miles to protect its fish stocks \u2013 one of its few resources \u2013 and warships became involved on both sides. Nato had to intervene and arbitrate between two member states. Very humbling to us, they basically won their far-sighted strategy.</p> <p>So is the discovery that at least 108 UK local authorities \u2013 25% of the total \u2013 plus charities, the police, universities and housing authorities have placed up to \u00a31bn in Icelandic banks, attracted by high interest rates that should have made the finance officers hesitate, but clearly didn't.</p> <p>It's a reminder that, though the banking sector is mostly to blame for the Great Crash of 2008 now underway and government-plus-regulators were also nodding on the touchline, we all played our modest part. </p> <p>People playing the max-the-multiple-credit-card game as well as card firms offering credit to children, those of us who withdrew all that equity from our homes, and all the other daft options (a 125% mortgage is surely the definition of negative equity?) \u2026 most of us did something silly.</p> <p>And so, it now transpires, did our councils, notwithstanding the nasty cold some of them were similarly embarrassed by in a bank collapse a few years back. One hundred and fifty thousand private UK citizens too. Risky stuff, I'd say. I wonder which newspapers urged their readers to go north and place the nest egg in another (even smaller) currency. I think we should be told - but won't be. Meanwhile ministers, reluctant yesterday, may be forced to bail them out, too.</p> <p>Yet <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/oct/10/banking\">a letter in today's Guardian from Willem Buiter and Anne Sibert</a>, two LSE professors (Buiter once sat on the Bank of England's monetary policy committee) Iceland's banks credit rating has been in serious doubt for at least six months, hence the high interest rates.</p> <p>Of course, the Icelanders have been reckless in expanding their banking sector from such a slender base to what it was until a few days ago. But haven't we all? </p> <p>Icelanders have lived precariously on the edge of the world for thousands of years, mostly in poverty, sustained by their heroic sagas and myths, and by near universal literacy for over 100 years. Such was their sturdy sense of independence that they won autonomy from Denmark in 1904 and steered clear of the EU. </p> <p>That may change now \u2013 just as Scotland's banking disasters in the 1690s steered it towards the Act of Union (1707) with England and may sustain the union in the present one.</p> <p>So Icelanders may be better equipped than most to endure renewed hardship. As with much else we shall see. The US is interested in Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling's rescue plan \u2013 with one of its three prongs as buying bank stock, not toxic debt \u2013 while the EU's France and Germany are sniffy.</p> <p>Meanwhile, our old rivals in Moscow have not been idle. Ponder, if you have not, the news that Russia, awash with petro-cash even if its emerging stock market has unwisely closed (how can they price assets now?), has loaned Reykjavik $4bn to tide it over. Why not? </p> <p>Iceland skilfully used its cold war importance to move away from fishing and farming - too far away, it now transpires - and if Europe and the US are now too preoccupied to help, it will look elsewhere. We can only be grateful it was Russia with its not-very-good navy stirring trouble, not China, that made the loan.</p> <p>But that is how the world now turns. Not very far away is Iceland - <a href=\"http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?ie=UTF8&amp;ll=56.752723,6.064453&amp;spn=36.537529,79.101563&amp;z=4\">check the map</a>. As we keep repeating here, it's nationalism, not nationalisation, that ought to be keeping us all awake now. </p> <p>Nationalising the banks was a necessary expedient, but a return to nationalisation is not the answer, however tempting to old lefties. If China and Russia have given up, it's no time for us to relaunch a People's Republic of our own. Banks are like the utilities: we need them more than we need most things. </p> <p>If it helps, think of them and their product - money and credit - as a form of sewage. We just have to keep the shit moving or we all die.</p> <p>* Who is Sporticus? You clearly don't watch children's TV. Known in its native Iceland as Latibaer, it is a brilliant show, known in 100 countries as LazyTown or some such variant. Written, devised and starring a former gymnast called Magn\u00fas Scheving, it urges its little viewers to eat better and take exercise. David Cameron is a fan. It's also terrific, one of Iceland's better exports.</p>",

  "<p><strong><br>Justin Urquhart Stewart</strong>, analyst at <strong>Seven Investment Managemen</strong>t, says a combination of issues are creating the \"perfect storm\".</p> <p>\"It's not just an issue of slowing economies around the world but a series of dots that are keeping investors from participating in the market such as Iceland's turmoil, the banking crisis and Singapore slipping into recession,\" he said.</p> <p>\"When markets opening this morning, there was a whiff of nerves in the air, you could smell the fear. The last time I remember this kind of situation was back during the 1987 stockmarket crash.</p> <p>\"The nerves will only really go away when the banking system is more functional. The banking package provides a very good start but this has not kicked in yet. You can't force it through, but we hope that the government's guarantee on deposits and provision of extra capital will start to take effect.</p> <p>\"This is the most important thing rather than the economy slowing. A good banking system is the lifeblood of capitalism and, until stability is restored, there will not be a recovery elsewhere.</p> <p>\"Going forward, I think we're in for more volatility. How much further markets can fall no one really knows. Investors need to look at what's happening and determine whether we're really heading for Armageddon. Likelihood is that things will be a bit better in five years' time and this is the long-term view that needs to be taken. Now is the worst time to sell off; investors shouldn't look at the short term.\"</p> <p><strong>David Buik</strong>, strategist at <strong>BGC Partners,</strong> called the panic selling \"illogical\" and said a recovery in the economy would be under way once the banking system - \"the artery of society\" \u2013 was mended.</p> <p>\"This is panic selling and it is illogical in the extreme,\" he said. \"We know we're going into recession, we know the banking system is failing, but is it really necessary to drive into this deeper?</p> <p>\"Are we near the bottom? I don't know, but the market will eventually tell us. </p> <p>\"The banking sector is the problem here and, until trust is restored and Libor rates [the rate at which banks lend to each other] are brought down, we will continue to have a problem. The G7 finance meeting this weekend can have an impact if they agree to protect all deposits but to expect any more than this would be folly.</p> <p>\"All the measures by the US and the UK are a year too late. After Bear Stearns went down, it was obvious there was a serious problem developing and the US should have had a contingency plan in place; same with the UK after Northern Rock. But both governments have been reactive rather than proactive. </p> <p>\"The banking rescue package will probably take about three months to take effect. It's not going to be an overnight remedy. It will work because it has to work. There is no plan B. Confidence takes time to be restored. More interest rate cuts will help this as well.</p> <p>\"Markets are going to see massive volatility in the next three or four days with the FTSE 100 possible going down to 2003 levels of 3282.\"</p> <p><strong>David Evans</strong>, market analyst at <strong>betonmarkets.com</strong>, thinks the Lehman Brothers' credit default swaps (CDS) auction, which is settled later today, could be a significant factor in where the markets head next.</p> <p>Credit default swaps are instruments bought by investors to insure against defaults on corporate and other bonds.</p> <p>If sellers of CDS outweigh buyers in the Lehman Brothers' auction, as some are expecting, then losses could hit 90% of insurance sold.</p> <p>The auction will be one of the largest settlements of contracts in the $55 trillion market, with about $400bn in contract volumes estimated on Lehman's debt.</p> <p>\"Nobody knows who owns what debt and this is what is causing the continued falls in stock markets,\" Evans says. \"There is no transparency - banks either don't know how much they are liable for or they don't want to own up to their exposure to bad debts.</p> <p>\"The problem with the government action is that it still hasn't addressed the root of the issue. There is no trust at all, banks are hoarding cash and we can see this from the Libor rate, which is going up.</p> <p>\"The Lehman auction could be a turning point. If it is a non-event, there could be a tentative recovery, but if more exposure than expected is revealed then we are on course for more sharp falls in the markets.\"</p> <p>\"I don't think stock markets can continue falling this dramatically for much longer. We'll either see a turnaround as confidence comes back or it will keep edging lower but in a more measured way.\"</p> <p><strong>Ryan Kneale</strong>, market analyst at City bookmakers <strong>www.BetsForTraders.com</strong>, said: \"During the past week, the equity markets have gone from bad to worse and then worse again, as traders' confidence hit rock bottom and the global sell-off in equities continued. </p> <p>\"Not even the US banking bailout, which was passed last Friday, and the concerted effort of central banks worldwide to cut interest rates could stop the rot. Financial stocks continued to get pummelled, as governments worldwide were forced to step in to rescue stricken banks and everyone has been left asking when and where will it all end? One thing is for sure, the banking sector will never be the same again.\"</p>",
  "<p>Singapore officially slid into <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/globalrecession\">recession</a> today after falling consumer demand from the US and Europe hammered its manufacturing exports.</p> <p>The south-east Asian country's economy contracted by 6.3% in the third quarter, on an annualised seasonally adjusted basis, having shrunk by 5.7% in the second quarter of 2008. This forced the government to cut its growth forecast for this year from 4%-5% to 3%. Analysts had expected a small rise in GDP.</p> <p>\"There's no question that growth will continue to slow down,\" said Yuwa Hedrick-Wong, economic adviser in Asia for MasterCard Worldwide. \"2009 will likely be a very difficult year.\"</p> <p>Singapore's economy, which is heavily dependent on exports to the developed world, is one of the first in Asia to be hit by a global economic slowdown. Following the rampant growth of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/03/india.china\">China and India</a>, many analysts believed Asia was well positioned to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/02/creditcrunch.china\">weather the storm</a>. </p> <p>But Asia relies on the west for trade, so slowing US and UK economies hit growth.</p> <p>Along with markets worldwide, Singapore also experienced the gloom of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/10/marketturmoil-creditcrunch\">Black Friday</a> with stocks closing 8% lower earlier today</p> <p>Singaporean manufacturing sector shrank by a hefty 11.5% in the third quarter, driven by a slump in pharmaceuticals. Construction and services activity maintained steady growth. </p> <p>Prime minister Lee Hsien Loong said Asian economies faced slowing growth for at least the next year and will not be spared in this global crisis.</p> <p>\"The problems facing financial institutions in the US and Europe are complex and grave,\" he said in a speech. \"Asian countries cannot avoid the impact of weakening US, European and Japanese economies.\"</p> <p>\"The world is caught up in a financial storm, and dark clouds fill our immediate horizon. The fear and panic gripping financial markets everywhere will take time to subside.\"</p> <p>Singapore's central bank, known as the Monetary Authority, today shifted its foreign exchange rate policy to a \"zero per cent appreciation\" of the Singapore dollar from a \"modest and gradual appreciation\" in a bid to boost the competitiveness of the country's exports.</p> <p>The government said last month that non-oil exports plummeted 14% in August after a 5.8% fall in July.</p> <p>\"A strong Singapore dollar has been quite detrimental to growth, especially manufacturing,\" Hedrick-Wong said. \"It's much better to take a risk with inflation and deal with growth by making the Singapore dollar weaker and support exports.\"</p> <p>Last month Ireland became the first member of the eurozone to fall into recession.</p>",
  "<p>The government is considering a temporary suspension of retirement fund rules to help pensioners survive the credit crunch, it emerged today.</p> <p>The move follows a dramatic fall in share prices as panic spreads across world markets.</p> <p>Today the FTSE 100 Index crashed 10% amid fears of a global recession.</p> <p>Under the current rules, savers have to cash in their pension fund before the age of 75 and purchase an annuity that pays them a set annual sum until their death.</p> <p>The fall in the stock market means anyone who is approaching 75 will be buying an annuity while the value of their pension fund is low.</p> <p>Around 95% of pensioners purchase an annuity before they reach 75 but the small number who wait until the final deadline may find themselves having to survive on far less than they anticipated if the current rules are adhered to.</p> <p>Rosie Winterton, the pensions minister, said yesterday: \"We understand that people are concerned about their pensions following the recent falls in share prices.</p> <p>\"Given the current turbulence in the markets it makes sense that we keep all policies under review to ensure pensioners and people saving for their retirement are protected.</p> <p>\"We have worked very closely with stakeholders to deliver a consensus in the important pensions issues over recent years and in these times we continue to be keen to meet opposition parties and industry experts to discuss their concerns.\"</p> <p>David Cameron, the Conservative leader, yesterday urged the government to take action to protect older pensioners.</p> <p>\"Under the current rules they are going to be forced to buy an annuity, cash in their pension scheme and set their income for the rest of their life, at a very, very bad time,\" he said.</p> <p>George Emsden, a financial consultant, said that a temporary suspension of the rule would anger anyone who had just bought an annuity.</p> <p>\"Suspending this rule and reintroducing it would cause riots,\" he said.</p> <p>\"People who have just bought an annuity will say: 'Why did I have to buy it?'</p> <p>\"Either you have the rule or you don't. Suspending it and bringing it back would be grossly unfair.\"</p> <p>Emsden, a senior consultant with London-based In2 Consulting Ltd, said he thought the rule should be scrapped to give people more choice about what to do with their money.</p> <p>If not, the age deadline ought to be raised to reflect increasing life expectancies, he said, adding that he believed governments had resisted doing so because the annuity payments are subject to tax.</p> <p>Ivor Kellock, of Hertfordshire-based Kellock Wealth Management, said a temporary suspension of the age deadline \"makes perfect sense\" but added: \"The difficult decision for them to make is how long would they allow and how much notice would they give before they reintroduce it.</p> <p>\"How long will it take the stock market to recover?\"</p> <p>He said raising the age deadline might be one solution but added that he also believed the rules which forced people into buying annuities ought to be scrapped.</p> <p>\"We are all grown-ups. Surely we can make our own financial decisions.\"</p>",
  "<p>Surprising news from the world of work this week: we are not alone. You might think that depressing window views, identikit desks and challenging relations with IT are a uniquely British office phenomenon, but it turns out the whole world is finding working in an office - how can I put it? - a little trying. So much so that some of us are looking for distractions.</p> <p>Take the Indians, for example. In what must be my favourite story of the month the <a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/3566408.cms\">Times of India</a> advises eager employees on the ins and outs of sex in the office. Because, as they put it, \"almost every individual has nurtured kinky thoughts of getting down and dirty at the workplace\". Sure you have. </p> <p>Luckily, Madhavan Das, a spokesperson for Miditech Productions, has got the situation licked. \"We provide employees with a lot of distractions like games, separate rest rooms and adequate facilities, especially for those who work during the night. It is the priority of the organisation to take care of its people because it's natural for them to indulge in such acts. So an impromptu singing session or a quiz contest is called for to give the mind a break and pep one up.\"</p> <p>Over on the other side of the world, younger workers are in revolt. In Canada the under-30s are moving from a \"do anything\" attitude to a \"you've got to be kidding\" one. And all because they've apparently seen \"<a href=\"http://www.itbusiness.ca/it/client/en/home/News.asp?id=50250\">their father on stress leave and their mother on Prozac</a> and are determined to never make the same mistake\". As a result, older bosses are puzzled. And, I would hazard, prone to standing in large corner offices muttering about the youth of today. Tragically, I fear new graduates may be in for a shock: the report also points out that Canada is moving from a seller's to a buyer's recruitment market. </p> <p>Of course, if the young whippersnappers really can't bear to be told, they could always sneak across the border. In the US, <a href=\"http://www.business-standard.com/india/storypage.php?autono=336498\">Marilyn Moats Kennedy</a> reckons Generations X and Y are simply refusing to play by the office rules, starting with a refusal to follow instructions. \"If a 50-year-old says it ['This needs to be done'] to a 35-year-old, the younger worker hears a suggestion, not an order.\" Goodness. If my boss said to me: \"This needs to be done,\" I'd do it. Pronto. </p> <p>Lastly, good news from Blighty. <a href=\"http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23569658-details/Busy+pregnant+executives+bring+midwife+to+the+office/article.do\">The Evening Standard</a> reports that a London midwife has set up a company to offer antenatal care, desk-side. Midwife Lexie Minter explains that while GPs, physiotherapists and dentists have provided care in the office environment for years, no one had previously thought of offering midwifery. \"This service is tailor-made for the demands of the City. It gives value for money with the minimum of hassle and time.\" Unlike the resulting baby, of course.</p>",
  "<p>Every day brings more chilling news of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/oct/10/marketturmoil-creditcrunch\">UK banking crisis</a>. The financial markets opened this morning with yet another alarming plunge. This week's \u00a3500bn rescue by the government, considered necessary to lubricate a banking system on the brink of collapse, has cost each and every UK taxpayer anything estimated between \u00a32,000 and \u00a313,000. Those figures should scare anyone who seeks to comprehend them: how long will it take to repay that much when UK plc has been running at a loss even in times of plenty?</p> <p>One financial expert said yesterday that our country had only one world-leading industry \u2014 banking \u2014 and that the failure of the regulators has let that crumble to dust. This is not strictly true. During the past 15 years of unprecedented growth in the global economy, English football has also blossomed widely to be regarded as the world's best domestic league.</p> <p>Intriguingly, this week we learn that its \"regulator\", the Football Association, is seeking to apply stricter controls on the free-market-orientated <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/premierleague\">Premier League</a>. Just as we all wish with hindsight that the Financial Services Authority had curbed the worst excesses of the banks before it was too late, there are interesting parallels with the finance sector here.</p> <p>The debts run up by clubs - a cumulative \u00a33bn - are considered by the Premier League to be serviceable. This is at best a spurious generalisation.</p> <p>There are two years' guaranteed income from the current, \u00a32.7bn broadcast deals. Richard Scudamore, the Premier League chief executive, confidently predicts that broadcast income will \"at least\" be maintained in the next three-year cycle. But can he be sure? Even allowing for growth in overseas markets, can Sky and Setanta continue to pour billions of pounds into his league when consumers start to consider the \u00a349-per-month combined subscription fees an expensive luxury?</p> <p>It is very interesting that while taking over equity and injecting fresh capital, the government's rescue of the banks has left the so-called \"toxic\" assets on their balance sheets. What could be more toxic than the, say, \u00a380m debt accrued by a football club whose turnover is less than \u00a3100m, whose wage bill is \u00a365m, who hasn't made a profit for five years and who risks relegation from the Premier League - an event that would slash its revenues in half?</p> <p>The Premier League's most indebted member clubs are gripped with fear. This year, one that has produced greater income for every Premier League club than ever before, will inevitably lead to greater problems than ever in their history for those that end up being relegated. Leeds United were able to survive the catastrophic financial impact of relegation \u2014 just. The next time it happens creditors (not least the taxman, who now needs every penny he can squeeze) will not be so forgiving.</p> <p>Similarly, the problems felt by those \"relegated\" from the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/championsleague\">Champions League</a> will also be devastating. With the certain exception of Chelsea (whose owner insulates them from the chill winds of the markets) and possibly Arsenal (whose stadium debts were broadly fixed at very favourable rates; although their success is predicated on the fans continuing to pay for very expensive season tickets) the risks have suddenly become much greater. Failure to reach the Champions League groups would have very dangerous consequences. And this is at a time when Uefa's competition reforms have made qualification for leagues' fourth-placed teams doubly difficult.</p> <p>Liverpool are very heavily in debt and do not own a cash-generative stadium. If they do not qualify for next year's Champions League group stage - which, even if they do not progress, provides a minimum \u00a310m in revenues - they could not service their borrowings. Similarly Manchester United. Provided buyers could be found (no longer a given as sovereign-wealth funds equivalent to the Abu Dhabi United Group spy far more profitable targets at bottom-of-the-market bargain prices) both clubs would have to be sold.

  "<p>Up until last week, when at least one, and possibly two, Irish banks stared into the abyss, Brian Cowen and his cabinet in Dublin had been preoccupied with what to do about Europe. Before the financial world spun on its axis and the Irish government was propelled towards emergency action to save the republic's banking system one of the two main concerns exercising the minds of Cowen's coalition was how to sell Lisbon Mark II to their electorate. <br><br>While the Fianna F\u00e1il-Green-Progressive Democrat government has moved its focus temporarily away from trying to rescue the EU reform treaty that Irish voters mortally wounded back in June, the financial crisis and their response to it could have a longer term impact on Irish European policy. </p> <p>At present serious consideration is being given to a \"put up or shut up\" European referendum next year, according to one senior source in Fianna F\u00e1il. In a rerun of Lisbon, Irish voters will be given a stark choice: either back the EU reform programme or by voting \"no\" your country is in effect ejecting itself from Europe. </p> <p>To sweeten such a bitter choice, the EU will issue public guarantees that Ireland's traditional neutrality is under absolutely no threat, and that the republic can opt out of any military alliance it feels uncomfortable about. Irish Catholic bishops, meanwhile, will be enlisted to assure those conservative, devout sections of the electorate that Ireland's ban on abortion cannot be undermined by any section of the Lisbon treaty. </p> <p>Ireland's move to shore up its banking system has already provided opponents of Lisbon with deadly ammunition in the propaganda war. Some of the most effective anti-Lisbon campaign groups, such as the pro-business free-marketeers of Libertas, have pointed out that Ireland acted unilaterally in its own national interests first. The Irish government, they say, didn't wait for Brussels to give the nod to their aid package for the banks. They just went ahead and did it. </p> <p>It wasn't just Alistair Darling who rang Brian Lenihan, the Irish finance minister, to warn against the dangers of the republic going it alone on the banks. A range of EU politicians stepped forward last week to complain about - and indeed condemn - Irish financial unilateralism. Brussels, Berlin and Paris wagged the finger, but Ireland ignored all the admonishing. </p> <p>Having gone on a solo run by saving their banks, the Irish government now faces the danger of latent public hostility to an EU that would have, at the very least, slowed down or blocked that aid programme. Suddenly Europe was quite vividly in opposition to an Irish government \u2013 a point that will be amplified by opponents such as Libertas if and when the Cowen administration go back to the people. </p> <p>The chaos in the global financial system and the Irish government's response to it however does provide the Cowen government with some ammunition of their own in the struggle over Europe. In its battles with its rightwing opponents such as Libertas the government can paint them as free-market zealots of the kind that created the credit crunch first in the United States and then the rest of the world. Ireland, as one Irish minister infamous put it, faces a choice between the economics of Boston or those of Berlin. With American free-for-all capitalism apparently in freefall, the Irish government could argue that the EU economic model, including its regulations and state intervention, suddenly looks like a more attractive, solid alternative to Boston. </p> <p>Meantime the taoiseach and his ministers and advisers have to turn their attentions away from Lisbon Resurrected to next Tuesday's budget. Senior Fianna F\u00e1il sources have confirmed that it will be, in their words, \"a brutal budget\" with swingeing cuts across the public sector and a hike in indirect taxation. </p> <p>It will in effect be as harsh as the budgets of the late 1980s, when Ireland was enduring mass unemployment and net migration. Pro-Europeans might point out too that during those dark days of recession one of the few institutions to inject badly needed cash into Ireland's infrastructure was the EU.</p>",

  "<p>Harry Potter fans at Bristol University are having a field day. A massive <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_Eagle-owl\">eagle owl</a> \u2013 the world's largest owl species, weighing in at over 4kg, with a wingspan of up to two metres \u2013 has taken up residence. Appropriately enough for a forest-loving species, its new home is in Woodland Road, just opposite the university's <a href=\"http://www.bristol.ac.uk/university/maps/precinct.html\">school of biological sciences</a>.</p> <p>It has been there for about three weeks now, but the first I heard about it was when my friend emailed me with the news.</p> <p>So earlier this week I popped down to take a look. At first I couldn't see it on its regular perch; then those nearby heard me utter a series of stunned and unprintable expletives. </p> <p>Because this isn't just any old owl, but one of Europe's most majestic bird species. The French treat it with respect, calling it \"le grand duc d'Europe\"; though the Dutch and Germans, more prosaically, simply refer to it by its call: \"Uhu\". For the British, only an association with another magnificent bird of prey will do.<br><br>Looking up at the owl, as it snoozed contentedly on a branch, I simply couldn't believe its size. It looked more like a large dog than a bird, though appearances can be deceptive, as most of its bulk comes from its feathers. </p> <p>So what on earth is it doing here in the middle of Bristol? Well at the risk of upsetting twitchers keen to add this bird to their British list, it is probably an escape from an aviary or bird collection. However, there is an outside chance that it is the offspring of a wild breeding pair in Britain.</p> <p>The past few years have seen increasing numbers of reports of <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/nature/largest-owls-in-the-world-threaten-british-birds-930862.html\">escaped eagle owls</a>, and now they are actually breeding in the wild. This presents the conservation authorities with a tricky dilemma. As an alien predator, which potentially threatens native species of bird and mammal, any eagle owl should be recaptured; or if that isn't possible, killed. But although many would agree with the culling of grey squirrels or mink, they draw the line at harming this majestic creature. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.rspb.org.uk\">RSPB</a> is taking a rather <a href=\"http://www.rspb.org.uk/ourwork/policy/species/eagleowls.asp\">cautious view</a> at present. The society is not yet calling for a cull of eagle owls, but instead suggesting careful monitoring of feral populations. As they point out: </p> <blockquote> <p>It would be very unfortunate to discover in 20 years time that they were devastating native birds and, by then, it would be very difficult to do anything about it.</p> </blockquote> <p>Given that most eagle owls in Britain live in upland areas, the threat to rare species such as the <a href=\"http://www.rspb.org.uk/wildlife/birdguide/name/b/blackgrouse/index.asp\">black grouse</a> and <a href=\"http://www.rspb.org.uk/wildlife/birdguide/name/h/henharrier/index.asp\">hen harrier</a> is a very real one. </p> <p>When it wants to, the RSPB can be surprisingly ruthless regarding non-native bird species. The <a href=\"http://www.rspb.org.uk/ourwork/policy/species/ruddyduck/index.asp\">ruddy duck</a> is a famous case in point: accidentally introduced to Britain after the second world war by none other than <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Scott\">Sir Peter Scott</a>, this North American duck began to cause problems when some rather amorous males flew off to Spain and started hybridising with the globally endangered <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-headed_Duck\">white-headed duck</a>.<br> <br>A concerted effort, with marksmen targeting the birds, has seen the ruddy duck population reduced from about 6,000 individuals to fewer than 500, and the species looks likely to be eradicated from Britain in the next few years. </p> <p>And conservationists are also keeping a close eye on another new kid on the block \u2013 the rose-ringed (or ring-necked) <a href=\"http://www.rspb.org.uk/ourwork/policy/species/parakeets.asp\">parakeet</a>, which may also reach pest proportions unless measures are taken to limit its population.</p> <p>Meanwhile, back in Bristol, the eagle owl is proving a popular attraction for university students and staff, and other passers-by. And as Professor Julian Partridge from the university's biological sciences department told me, it's welcome to stay as long as it likes:</p> <blockquote> <p><br>It is certainly an inspiring bird, not only for its sheer size but also because of its perky 'ears' and apparent interest in things around it. Far from moping, it seems in good health and is alert and apparently curious about observers on the ground. It's a lovely animal to see and I wish him or her well: it is certainly difficult to see this beautiful owl as any form of ill omen!</p> </blockquote>",

At least not yet.</p> <p>Many restaurateurs have remained surprisingly bullish throughout the onset of this so-called recession, and their optimism is backed up by hard facts. Pub company <a href=\"http://www.mbplc.com/index.asp\">Mitchells &amp; Butlers</a>, for instance, has just released <a href=\"http://www.bighospitality.co.uk/item/2330/23/5/3\">positively buoyant new figures</a>. The world might be going to hell in a hand basket, but people still want to eat at a <a href=\"http://www.harvester.co.uk\">Harvester</a>. Insert your own joke here.<br><br>While people are still eating out, however, there is clear evidence that diners, at all levels, are keen to economise. <a href=\"http://www.toptable.co.uk\">Toptable.com</a> recently reported a 40% rise in the number of bookings it had handled in the first six months of this year. It's currently processing 10,000 covers a day. (Who knew? Am I the only person in Britain still using the phone when I want to make a restaurant reservation?). </p> <p>Of those diners, however, some 40-45% are taking advantage of the <a href=\"http://www.toptable.co.uk/offers\">900+ special offers available at the site</a>. The list currently includes a 2-for-1 breakfast offer at <a href=\"http://www.roast-restaurant.com/home.cfm\">Roast</a>; a <a href=\"http://www.gordonramsay.com/thedevonshire/menus/setlunch\">\u00a313.50 two-course lunch</a> at Gordon Ramsay's Devonshire pub; and a <a href=\"http://www.toptable.co.uk/venues/restaurants/?id=55\">\u00a325, four-courses-plus-glass-of-fizz deal</a> at <a href=\"http://www.bentleys.org/home\">Bentley's</a>. </p> <p>Many of these relative bargains aren't exclusive to toptable.com either. For instance, Michelin-starred <a href=\"http://www.hibiscusrestaurant.co.uk\">Hibiscus's</a> \u00a325 set lunch has long been one of the capital's best offers. All of which, here at Word of Mouth, set us thinking: just what is the best restaurant \"deal\" in the country? </p> <p>Last month, in Guardian Weekend, Simon Hopinkson lavished praise on the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2008/sep/06/restaurants.foodanddrink1\">prix-fixe lunch at Le Gavroche</a>. To recap, that's nibbles, three courses (three choices at each course, including cheese), half-a-bottle of wine per person, water, coffee and petit fours for \u00a348 a head. Yes, at that price, <a href=\"http://www.le-gavroche.co.uk\">Le Gavroche</a> may still be best suited to the gilded rich, but, \u00a3-for-lb, for two star cooking, in a restaurant with such history, this offer is rightly legendary.</p> <p>If you're flexible on times, and have the self-control not to go wild with the wine list, you can eat at many of Britain's best restaurants surprisingly cheaply. For instance, I've heard good things about the \u00a317.50, three-course pre-theatre (5pm-7pm) menu at <a href=\"http://www.arbutusrestaurant.co.uk\">Arbutus</a>; while the new-ish Angelus - <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2007/sep/16/foodanddrink.restaurants\">much admired</a> by our own Jay Rayner - is currently offering a three course set lunch menu, wine (half-bottle), mineral water, coffee and petits fours for \u00a336pp.</p> <p>Still too rich for your blood? Then how about the express lunch at <a href=\"http://www.sweetmandarin.com/reviews.html\">creditable Manchester Chinese</a>, Sweet Mandarin. \u00a35.50 for two courses sounds like a steal; as does \u00a36 for the Le Complet lunch (main course, tapas dish, salad, coffee) at <a href=\"http://www.list.co.uk/place/103133-chez-pierre\">Chez Pierre</a>, a new venture from <a href=\"http://www.pierrelevicky.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3&amp;Itemid=4\">Pierre Levicky</a>, of Pierre Victoire fame. <br> <br>Personally, I'd have to go for the early bird \"tapas for two\" deal at <a href=\"http://www.elgatonegrotapas.com\">El Gato Negro</a>. You get six dishes, as chosen by chef Simon Shaw, and a bottle of house wine for \u00a335. It might be in West Yorkshire, but, seriously, EGN could hold its own among Barcelona's finest, <a href=\"http://forums.egullet.org/index.php?showtopic=98374\">as this thread at eGullet attests</a>. </p> <p>But what about you? What are the best deals you've found? Where can we eat like kings for a fraction of the normal a la carte price? And, while we're on the subject, any horror stories? Ever turned up to dine on a voucher and been palmed off with soup and sardines? Been treated like leper because you're eating from the set lunch? People, we need to know ...</p>",
  "<p>Asia's financial crisis deepened today after Japan's Nikkei stock average fell almost 10% in its biggest single-day drop for more than 20 years.</p> <p>The world's second-biggest economy was also rocked by the collapse of an established life insurer: Yamato Life Insurance becomes the country's first major victim of the US credit crunch.</p> <p>The Nikkei, already reeling from a fall of almost 10% on Wednesday, shed 881 points, or 9.62%, to end the day at 8,276, its lowest close since May 2003. </p> <p>The index has fallen by an average of 24% this week, more than double the weekly losses seen in the aftermath of the 1987 stock market crash. The Nikkei has lost 46% this year and nearly a quarter of its value since last Friday.</p> <p>\"Selling is unstoppable in New York and Tokyo,\" Yutaka Miura, a senior strategist at Shinko Securities, told the Associated Press. \"Investors were gripped by fear.\"</p> <p>On the final day of the Nikkei's worst week in history, yet another orgy of selling was sparked by an overnight drop of 7.3% on the Dow Jones industrial average and news that Yamato, a 98-year-old life insurance firm, had become Japan's first major financial firm to collapse as a result of the US credit crisis.</p> <p>Yamato, which said it was filing for court protection from creditors, is the first Japanese life insurer to fail for seven years and the fifth largest bankruptcy of the year in Japan. NewCity Residence Investment, a real estate investment trust, also filed for bankruptcy.</p> <p>Officials issued reassurances that Yamato's failure, with debts totaling 269 billion yen, would not trigger a collapse among other insurers.</p> <p>\"It is the smallest company in our nation's insurance sector,\" the economics minister, Kaoru Yosano, told reporters. \"The incident is a failure of a company that had a unique business model.\"</p> <p>The firm, which employs more than 1,000 people, had paid dearly for making higher risk investments and underestimating the extent of the sub-prime crisis.</p> <p>\"The worldwide drop in asset value triggered by the sub-prime shock was unexpectedly large,\" said Yamato's president, Takeo Nakazono. \"We are truly sorry about what has happened and offer our heartfelt apologies.\"</p> <p>The Nikkei's plunge was repeated across the region, as investors were spooked yet again by the overnight fall on Wall Street.</p> <p>Key indexes in Hong Kong, South Korea and Australia were sharply down, while Singapore said it had officially slid into recession for the first time since 2002 after a report showed its economy had contracted 6.3% in the third quarter.</p> <p>Recession fears are mounting in Japan, where consumption is flat and exporters have been hit hard by the financial maelstrom sweeping across the US and Europe.</p> <p>With the failure of Wednesday's joint rate cut by several central banks to ease investor fears, pressure is mounting for additional measures when the G7 central bank heads and finance ministers meet in Washington this weekend.</p> <p>But analysts said the G7 nations were quickly running out of options. \"Investors are not so sure that the G7 will announce effective measures to contain the global financial crisis,\" said Shinko Securities' Miura.</p> <p>Yosano insisted Japan could pull away from the brink of a US-style credit crisis. \"We need to make sure that we don't get pulled too much by global tides,\" he said. \"I hope investors make decisions calmly based on Japan's economic fundamentals.\"</p> <p>The Bank of Japan pumped 4.5 trillion yen into the Tokyo markets today, its biggest single-day injection of funds and the 18th consecutive day it has attempted to increase liquidity.</p>",
  "<p>The China Business Post, a weekly financial newspaper published in China by Hong Kong-listed SEEC Media, has been suspended for three months by Chinese authorities after the newspaper ran a negative story on the Agricultural Bank of China, one of China's top four state-owned banks.</p> <p>According to the story published in July, a subsidiary of the Agricultural Bank of China in Hunan province allegedly wrote off 4.61bn yuan (\u00a3387m) bad debt, in breach of regulations, this year. The bank later denied most of the key charges and claimed it reserves the rights of further lawsuits. The newspaper responded by saying the investigation was fair without malicious intent.<br> Then, on September 25, the China Business Post put a statement on its website announcing that a \"superior administration\" <a href=\"http://www.chinafreepress.org/publish/Othernews/China_Business_Post_Caijing_Shibao_Newspaper_Suspended_for_Three_Months_for_Problematic_Reporting.shtml\">had imposed a three-month suspension of publication</a> on the newspaper because the superior administration believed the newspaper had violated several news propaganda protocols, including \"Local newspaper should not conduct cross-region investigation,\" \"News reporting should follow formal interview procedures\" and \"Important and sensitive reports should be presented to and confirmed by the reported side before publication\". </p> <p>\"Cross-region investigation\" is a unique term in China. All of the country's media must affiliate with an authority, a state or provincial governmental organisation. This imposes artificial boundaries on reporting in terms of speciality or region. </p> <p>In recent years this has seldom been observed but it is now being used to penalise the China Business Post. In defiant and discontented tones, the newspaper said it would appeal to the relevant authorities. <br> It is outrageous these rules are being used to suspend the China Business Post. I doubt any newspaper in the world would be able to produce any real investigative reports if they were restricted by these so-called news propaganda protocols.</p> <p>But this is the reality the media in China are facing. Here, all media are either owned or supervised by the Communist party of China. They are in principle only supposed to report on the positive side of the country. Any media daring to publish a negative story would potentially get in some trouble with the administrator.</p> <p>There are exceptions. For example, when the state-run news organisations like <a href=\"http://www.cctv.com/english/index.shtml\">China Central Television</a> (CCTV), <a href=\"http://www.chinaview.cn/\">Xinhua News Agency</a> and the <a href=\"http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/\">People's Daily</a> report a negative story, it is usually seen as being officially sanctioned to send out a warning signal to the accused from the highest authority. In China, the media are regarded as the mouthpiece of the party. <br> Despite such strict control, gradual marketisation has fuelled more media openness. Foreign and private capital is now allowed to invest in the media sector. </p> <p>Those investors can help operate the business and share the profits but will have no say on editorial control and personnel appointment. This has created a strange situation in that investors in the media sector could lose everything overnight if superior administrators are not happy to see what is published. <br> Investigative business reporting has been tolerated more and more in China as the journalists keep testing the authorities' boundaries. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/18/china\">Sanlu milk powder scandal</a> is a good example. Without the media investigation across the country, the public wouldn't be aware of the level of the problem and how widely it had spread.<br> This time, however, the China Business Post got into trouble because the Agricultural Bank is a much more powerful organisation. The bank has a deep connection with all levels of the government. It is believed that, if the bank wishes, it could get the newspaper suspended by asking for help from senior officials in the Communist party's propaganda department.  So media openness in China has proved to be just an illusion and the extent of their freedom depends on whom the media are targeting. So-called propaganda protocols are murky and changeable. Before major political events, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/blog/2008/aug/15/the21edictsofchineseolymp\">media environment</a> usually <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/13/olympics2008.chinathemedia\">gets tougher</a> and then loosens afterwards.</p> <p>It's not surprising that every newspaper editor in China, before running a story, has to assess the potential dangers and decide whether it's worth taking such a risk. A popular motto among Chinese editors is: \"Hit the fly, but stay clear of the tiger.\"<br> The suspension of the China Business Post rang <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/d9d764c0-8b14-11dd-b634-0000779fd18c.html\">alarm bells</a> among editors and journalists in China. Although Chinese journalists will definitely continue to test the propaganda administration's tolerance in the future, this has already been a setback, at least temporarily, to China's media openness. </p> <p>Journalists and editors will have to rein in investigative reporting for a while. One month after the Olympics and days before the third plenary session of the 17th Communist party central committee, scheduled from October 9 to 12, the media tightening is back.</p>",

This week, we welcome one of the team who made it, Juliette Culver, who's stood under the grill and has answered our tough questions. Keep reading for all kinds of insights into how to build your own (alternate reality) game for just \u00a31000.<br><br><strong>Explain your game to my mum in 140 words.</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.operationsleepercell.com/\">Operation: Sleeper Cell</a> is a game about biscuits, tea (stirred not shaken) and loveliness. It's an online game to raise money for Cancer Research UK and is free to play. You are trained as a special agent by a secret organisation known as The Agency that works to spread loveliness throughout the world. During the course of the game you work together with other agents to accomplish missions, solve puzzles, raise money for Cancer Research UK and eventually uncover enough intelligence to save the word from The Agency's arch-enemies E.V.I.L. You can also follow the inner goings-on at <a href=\"http://www.wearenottheagency.com/\">The Agency</a> and might even find things spilling over into real life...</p> <p><strong>How do players control the game?</strong><br>The game centres around 'the grid'. Some cells on the grid are 'sleeper cells' that give you missions to complete. As you do so, you go up in rank in The Agency and get access to more difficult missions as well as secret intelligence uncovered by the sleeper cells. But before players can access a mission, each cell needs to be unlocked with a donation. Sponsoring a cell in this way, gives the sponsoring team a head start over other players on the mission behind that cell. It's also possible to sponsor other cells on the grid with an image and link.</p> <p><strong>What is your background?</strong><br>Last year, there was a competition called <a href=\"http://www.letschangethegame.org/\">Let's Change Game</a> to design a game to help the work of Cancer Research UK. Our team, Law 37 won that competition and Operation: Sleeper Cell is the result. Everyone working on the game has been volunteering their spare time, so our backgrounds are really varied. Although we're new to making games such as this one, we've all been keen games players of some shape or form and in particular have a strong contigent of former Perplex City players.</p> <p><strong>Name your competitors.</strong><br>Not long after Operation: Sleeper Cell launched, The Red Cross announced a game called <a href=\"http://www.tracesofhope.com/\">Traces of Hope</a>. Also kicking off around now is <a href=\"http://www.superstructgame.org/\">SuperStruct</a>, a game about inventing solutions to future global problems. Both those games are very different from ours though - Operation: Sleeper Cell is far more light-hearted. Another big difference is that we're also trying to raise money for a charity as part of our game.</p> <p><strong>How many players do you have now and what's your target in 12 months?</strong><br>We've got about 200 active players since we launched at the end of September. We'd like to have a lot more by the time the game finishes at the end of November as well as hopefully have raised lots of money for Cancer Research UK! As well as providing some fun and raising money, we also hope that what we're doing will make people in the gaming world think about new ways that games can reach out and do good.</p> <p><strong>What's your biggest challenge?</strong><br>Trying to fit making the game into our spare time! Everybody on the team has worked amazingly hard to make this game happen and it's incredible what they've achieved in the time. As well as that we've got team members as far apart as Edinburgh and Paris. This has meant that chances to meet and work on the game together in real life have been few and far between and we've had to make the most of what time we've had.</p> <p><strong>What's the weirdest development experience you've had thus far?</strong><br>That would probably be revealing too many secrets as to what is to come in the game!</p> <p><strong>What's your distribution/publishing plan?</strong><br>You can go an play it now. Just go to <a href=\"http://www.operationsleepercell.com/\">www.operationsleepercell.com</a> and sign up.</p> <p><strong>Are indie-developed games the latest killer app?</strong><br>It's been great having the creative freedom that we've had in developing the game. We were given a budget of \u00a31000 to make the game, and that's forced us to be quite imaginative but at the same time has enabled us to do lots of things that we wouldn't be able to without that sum of money. On the other hand, making the game with a household-name charity like Cancer Research UK behind us has also really helpful.</p> <p><strong>Are you the next big thing?</strong><br>It'd be great if it games for social causes such as charities and education did really take off.

  "<p>Serbia's <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7658103.stm\">success</a> in persuading the UN general assembly to support its application for an advisory opinion from the <a href=\"http://www.icj-cij.org/\">international court of justice</a> (ICJ) on the legality of Kosovo's unilateral declaration of independence represents a victory not only for Serbia's diplomatic endeavours in recent months, but for the rule of law and multilateralism more broadly. The decision by many EU member states not to back this initiative, however, further demonstrates the EU's contradictory attitude and approach towards matters of international law. </p> <p>In a bid to deter Serbia's diplomatic efforts, several attempts were made to directly link the issue to the country's European prospects. Britain's ambassador to Serbia, Stephen Wordsworth, <a href=\"http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/main/news/12224/\">publicly warned</a> that the resolution would be \"a mistake\" that constituted \"a direct challenge to the EU\"; one that will \"only make cooperation and Serbia's integration into the European Union more difficult\". Bernard Kouchner, the French foreign minister, meanwhile, stated that \"we have reiterated numerous times that Serbia cannot seek to join the European Union while also asking Europe to agree with the initiative\" and labelled the move \"self-destructively isolationist\".</p> <p>Having insisted that disputes in the western Balkans be settled through peaceful means, the EU's failure to support Serbia's initiative at the UN general assembly is fundamentally inconsistent and untenable. As the Serbian president, Boris Tadic, <a href=\"http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2008&amp;mm=09&amp;dd=25&amp;nav_id=53737\">re-affirmed</a>, \"our intention is not to repeat aggression or confrontation with the world, but to use a different methodology in politics which is not usually seen in the Balkans\".</p> <p>Advisory opinions from the ICJ, though non-binding, offer a powerful alternative for the peaceful resolution of conflicts, with solutions derived from the legal as opposed to political realm. To fail to act to strengthen such institutions of international law and justice at a time when the EU struggles to contend with Russia's recognition of South Ossetia's and Abkhazia's independence will only further undermine its standing in an increasingly unstable international environment. </p> <p>As a <a href=\"http://www.ecfr.eu/content/entry/commentary_europes_un_human_rights_problem/\">recent report</a> by the <a href=\"http://www.ecfr.eu/\">European council on foreign relations</a> revealed, with respect to human rights issues, the EU's influence at the UN continues to decline. One of the explanations given concerns the double standards of European states which continue to oppose discussion of their own human rights problems, such as those concerning the treatment of migrants, and avoid criticism of the United States' persistent violations. Europe's failure to support Serbia's initiative, despite its avowed commitment to the principles of the UN charter, will only further reinforce this growing sense of inconsistency and ambivalence in international affairs.</p> <p>By returning the Kosovo issue to the legal arena, Serbia's resolution is likely to further stem the already sluggish recognition process. In spite of significant diplomatic pressure from the architects of Kosovo's independence declaration, <a href=\"http://www.kosovothanksyou.com/\">recognition</a> has been forthcoming from only 48 of 192 UN member states. Though the ICJ's verdict will not be binding, the decision to seek a ruling will <a href=\"http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/main/news/12224/\">very likely</a> \"slow down or halt the wave of recognitions\". With many countries deeply concerned by Russia's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/28/georgia.russia\">retaliatory recognition</a> of Abkhazia and South Ossetia as independent states, Kosovo will continue to struggle for international legitimacy. </p> <p>Should the ICJ decide that Kosovo's unilateral declaration of independence breaches international law, <a href=\"http://www.mfa.gov.yu/Officials/jeremic_e.html\">Vuk Jeremic</a>, Serbia's foreign minister, expects several countries, for instance <a href=\"http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2008&amp;mm=10&amp;dd=02&amp;nav_id=53911\">Costa Rica</a>, to retract their recognition. A ruling of illegality by the ICJ would inevitably reignite debate in several EU countries which were deeply divided domestically over the recognition issue, particularly Poland and the Czech Republic. Indeed, Poland's president, <a href=\"http://www.president.pl/x.node?id=479\">Lech Kaczynski</a>, recently <a href=\"http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2008&amp;mm=09&amp;dd=25&amp;nav_id=53743\">blocked attempts</a> to establish an embassy in Pristina and condemned the Polish government's decision to recognise Kosovo. </p> <p>The EU's failure to support Serbia's application for an advisory ruling from the ICJ raises important questions about its commitment to strengthening international law and multilateral institutions. The decisions of EU member states themselves cannot and should not be exempt from legal scrutiny; nor should attempts be made to threaten Serbia's European prospects in a cynical bid to deter its recourse to legal means. Instead, respect for international law should be the hallmark of the EU and its burgeoning common foreign and security policy. For it to recapture some of its lost influence at the UN, the EU must no longer persist in applying double standards to matters of international law and justice.</p>",

In the Premier League the fourth official is a national list referee and so takes over the whistle. And if there is one, a volunteer with relevant experience is then taken from the crowd to act as the new fourth official. In the Villa v Sunderland game last month, one of the assistants was injured. The fourth official took over the line in the second half, and New Zealand Fifa referee Peter O'Leary, who was in the stands as a spectator, took over as fourth official. <br><em>Thanks to Joe Miley for the question. </em><br><strong>3)</strong> Book him \u2013 it's a cautionable offence whatever he's wearing underneath. I'm often asked why this law exists. There are a few reasons. One of them is crowd incitement: there's a famous old clip of a player running to the fans and taking off his shirt in celebration \u2013 it caused a crowd surge that led to fatalities. Other issues include preventing players showing political slogans, and the fact that it's a global game: in some countries the removal of the shirt is considered offensive. <em>Thanks to Henning Furback for the question.</em></p> <p>To submit a new question email <a href=\"mailto:you.are.the.ref@observer.co.uk\">you.are.the.ref@observer.co.uk</a>.
