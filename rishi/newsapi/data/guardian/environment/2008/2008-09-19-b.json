  "<p>These authors dismiss anthropogenic global warming with a few risibly weak \"sceptic\" talking points; they also write that \"the Sun's mass is infinitely greater than that of the moon\". Even so, their main topic is an important one - the politics of water usage as its planetary distribution changes. They explain dams, irrigation, water recycling and desalination, and consider future impacts of water on crops and populations. The most original ideas are that we should create a \"Conservation and Security Agency\", a sort of community help and disaster-response civilian army composed of the currently jobless, and that the Arab League should reach a peace agreement with Israel in exchange for agricultural know-how and Turkish water.</p>",
  "<p>As the sun broke through the morning mist on to the cobbles of Harmonigatan, I had the unnerving feeling that I should be somewhere else. This beautiful row of half-timbered houses was the home of a serial killer in the Henning Mankell novel, One Step Behind. Could this tranquil medieval town of Ystad in Sk\u00e5ne, Sweden's southernmost county, really be the stamping ground of Kurt Wallander, the morose, insomniac police inspector? I had expected something bleak and industrial, which is how Wallander's world emerges in the novels. </p> <p>The detective first appeared in Faceless Killers in 1991, and over the course of nine more novels became an international bestselling phenomenon, much like Colin Dexter's Inspector Morse, only with more hard-hitting social commentary. His books have been published in 33 countries generating a global, often obsessive, fan-base. Here, there is an entire industry devoted to him, centred at Ystad Studios, where Krister Henriksson has played him in 13 films and Rolf Lassg\u00e5rd in seven more. Now, Kenneth Branagh has persuaded the BBC to adapt three of the novels, Sidetracked, One Step Behind and Firewall; they are due to be screened in November with Branagh in the lead role.</p> <p>In Ystad, the surprises kept on coming. I had breakfast in the dining hall of the Continental (<a href=\"http://www.hotelcontinental-ystad.se\">hotelcontinental-ystad.se</a>) on Ystad Docks, sitting at the same table where Wallander began the investigations in One Step Behind. But the only real mystery in this elegant room was how they got the pancakes so fluffy. Despite Ystad's reputation for culinary innovation, Wallander never mentions the food. He's always too busy pacing the streets.</p> <p>Feeling I should do the same, I took a stroll down Lurendrejaregr\u00e4nd, a row of fishermen's cottages overlooking the ferries to Poland. Only footsteps away was the market square where a body is discovered at the beginning of Firewall. But all I could see were pretty houses and smiling faces, while a smell of freshly ground coffee hung in the air. </p> <p>Beyond the local newspaper offices on Sladdergatan I found myself outside a 16th-century house, staring at the carved angels over the doorways. This had once been a home for unwanted babies, most of whom were not expected to live very long. It was known as the \"Angel House\", as new arrivals would soon be departing heavenwards. At last, I felt this was an insight into Wallander's psyche; that the apparently beautiful conceals sadness and death. Thrilled with this thought, I hurried through the town square to Wallander's favourite restaurant, Br\u00f6derna M (<a href=\"http://www.brodernam.se\">brodernam.se</a>), hoping to commune with him further over a slice of pizza. But once again, the Inspector had foiled me. This wasn't the drab fast food joint I had expected from the books, but a stylish bistro.</p> <p>At Ystad Studios, the Cineteket visitor centre (<a href=\"http://www.cineteket.se\">cineteket.se</a>), displays a wealth of sets, props and footage from the Swedish productions alongside general exhibitions about film. Branagh had been based here too, but the BBC sets remained out of view. The only skinny I could get from the guide was that Branagh's Wallander would lose the opera habit he has in the books, lest he become confused with that other detective from Oxford . . . </p> <p>I was staying at the Saltsj\u00f6bad spa hotel (<a href=\"http://www.ysb.se\">ysb.se</a>, doubles from SEK1,750, \u00a3143) on the Ystad beachfront, a stylish homage to the holistic Swedish view of health, but while my companions lounged in flotation tanks, I headed out along the sand for which Sk\u00e5ne is famous. </p> <p>In the soft September light, the coastline held a mournful beauty, though thankfully a dearth of actual bodies (in Sidetracked, a retired politician had been scalped and left under one of the fishing boats). </p> <p>I went east, over the cliffs to K\u00e5seberga, towards a mystery much older than any of Wallander's. The Ales Stenar, an oval of standing stones crowning the clifftop, were thought to mark the burial site of a Viking longship, but have since been dated to neolithic times. For Wallander, they are a place for reflection, a favourite picnic site. Their position, so close to the sea and the horizon, gives the granite sentinels an aura that seems the perfect place to meditate on the unknowable.</p> <p>I followed Wallander to Malm\u00f6, but in the space of a decade the redundant docks have been transformed into a triumphant fusion of ecological housing, offices and parks. It had come a long way from the fretful city portrayed in Sidetracked. I spent my last night at the Hotel Duxiana (<a href=\"http://www.malmo.hotelduxiana.com\">malmo.hotelduxiana.com</a>, doubles from SEK2,090), where fine Swedish engineering has been applied to the most comfortable beds imaginable. </p> <p>Lying in opulence, I considered the Wallander enigma. In his homelands, I had discovered a happy, well-fed society living in beautiful cities and mellow countryside, with nary a psycho in sight. But, I thought, as I turned out the light, I may just have cracked the cure for the iconic detective's insomnia.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Sterling Airlines (0870 787 8038, <a href=\"http://www.sterling.com\">sterling.com</a> flies Gatwick-Copenhagen, from \u00a362 rtn, inc tax.

  "<p>Russia's two main stockmarkets bounced back yesterday after trading resumed for the first time since Wednesday - but were then closed after further volatility.</p> <p>The rouble-denominated MICEX and dollar-denominated RTS reopened from suspension, only for trading to be halted in the morning and afternoon. Regulators sought the closures as shares soared - the MICEX was up 26.3% and the RTS 20%. By early evening, trading had not resumed.</p> <p>The revival of Russian markets, coinciding with a strong rally on Wall Street and in London, came after the Kremlin pumped nearly $60bn (\u00a333bn) into money markets. Russia's finance ministry said on Wednesday it was lending $44bn to the three main banks, while the central bank announced loans of $14bn to ease the liquidity crisis.</p> <p>Yesterday the prime minister, Vladimir Putin, said Russia's economy remained secure. Speaking at an investors' forum in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, he said that the \"fundamental indicators\" were sound and the country had \"more than $550bn\" in currency reserves. \"Our response to problems will be market-orientated. The government and the central bank have sufficient reserves to defend the currency and financial system,\" Putin said. Other Kremlin officials made clear the government was prepared to intervene further.</p> <p>Last night, however, analysts warned it was premature to suggest Russia's liquidity problems were over. They said the finance ministry would be forced to intervene next month when banks and major companies settle quarterly tax bills. </p> <p>\"I think it's too populistic for our government to say everything is OK in Russia,\" Mikhail Zak, head of research at Veles Capital Research in Moscow, told the Guardian. \"There is enough money for one or two years to help with internal liquidity, but not longer.\" Yesterday's gains would likely be short-lived, he said, adding that firms were struggling to attract foreign investment. \"Russian banks and companies don't have enough money,\" he said. </p> <p>Russia is the worst-performing emerging market this year, falling $680bn from a record high in May. The RTS has lost 36% in September and, on Tuesday, the MICEX fell 17% - its biggest slide since Russia's 1998 financial default.</p> <p>The Russian economy is now integrated into global markets and has suffered this week as shares have fallen around the world. But the slump in Russia has been particularly acute because of falling oil prices and after foreign investors pulled out $35bn in capital since last month's brief war with Georgia.</p>",
  "<p>Capitol Hill is a five-minute drive down Pennsylvania Avenue from the US Treasury and it was here as dusk fell in Washington on Thursday that the US treasury secretary, Henry Paulson, arrived for talks with leading members of Congress. Shown into the suite of offices of Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House of Representatives, it was here on a sticky September day that the deal to save the American financial system from calamitous meltdown was done. </p> <p>In the room with Paulson were the most powerful central bankers in the world, Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve; Christopher Cox, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the key movers and shakers on Capitol Hill - Charles Schumer and Barney Frank.</p> <p>Schumer let the cat out of the bag to reporters ahead of the meeting. It had been called, he said, to discuss a plan whereby the US government would buy up the bad debts of America's banks -hundreds of billions of pounds of them - and put them in a state-owned asset management company.</p> <p>The remark flashed on to dealing screens just before the closing bell on Wall Street's stock market trading floor and the impact was immediate. Amid wild cheering, the Dow Jones Industrial Average took off in a rally which saw it gain more than 400 points in the last few minutes of trading.</p> <p>The recovery moved across the Pacific to Asia overnight and then rippled round to Europe. By the close of business in London last night, the FTSE 100 Index was more than 400 points higher. When traders went home from Canary Wharf a week earlier, on Friday September 12, the FTSE stood at 5416.7. When they left last night, the FTSE stood at 5311.3. The modest fall of 100 points or so gave no indication of quite what a momentous week it had been. </p> <p>At the meeting in Pelosi's office, called at the request of Paulson and Bernanke, the mood was tense if business-like. After the most traumatic week on Wall Street since the Great Depression, Paulson said something had to be done to shore up confidence in the financial system. Only two of America's investment banks - Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs - had survived the week and there were doubts about the future of both.</p> <p>Paulson and Bernanke said the selling threatened to get out of control. What had started as a problem in one segment of the American mortgage market was in danger of becoming a global contagion. In Russia, the Kremlin had shut down the stock market. In Britain, the government had helped orchestrate a rescue of Britain's mortgage lenders. Gold prices had shown their biggest ever one-day rise. The rush for safe havens had pushed the interest rate on US treasury bonds negative for a brief period, suggesting that investors were willing to pay the government for the privilege of assured security.</p> <p>Bernanke and Paulson knew it would be something of a hard sell. Wall Street is not popular in the US after the excesses of recent years. Ordinary Americans have seen their incomes stagnate as the masters of the universe have seen theirs soar. There was little appetite on Capitol Hill for burdening the budget with extra debt, especially if it meant raising taxes. But the treasury secretary and the Fed chairman insisted there was no alternative. </p> <p>The Bush administration had tried bailing out banks. It had tried letting them fail. It had tried mergers. None had worked. All that was left was to establish a Resolution Trust Fund, of the sort that had been used when the American savings and loans industry had imploded in the late 1980s. Thursday's meeting was told that this crisis was of a different magnitude. They needed to agree to set up an RTC and they needed to set it up quickly - before Congress broke up for the November elections. Forget party point-scoring, Paulson said, this is bigger than politics.</p> <p>Schumer and Pelosi agreed with the need for urgent action, but they told Paulson that the price would be reform, serious and deep-rooted reform of Wall Street. </p> <p>When Paulson went in front of the cameras yesterday he kept his side of the bargain. \"This crisis demonstrates in vivid terms that our financial regulatory structure is sub-optimal, duplicative and outdated.\" Once the crisis is over, Wall Street has been served notice that it will face the sort of clean-up not seen since FDR took big finance to task after 1933. In the presidential race, the sense that the Republicans have been the party of deregulation and the party of the well-off has changed the complexion of the race, putting the economy centre stage and boosting the fortunes of Barack Obama. </p> <p>The Democratic candidate for the White House was not the only one to try to seize the moment. Battered in the polls, railed against by uneasy backbenchers, dismayed at the impact of looming recession on his economic legacy as chancellor, Gordon Brown grabbed the political lifeline presented by the tumbling markets. He announced on Thursday lunchtime that he would clean up the City and the first leg of the reform programme was unveiled six hours later when the Financial Services Authority, the City's watchdog, slapped a temporary ban on short selling. The FSA, under its new chairman, Lord Turner, will be given the task of making London's light-touch regulatory regime a bit more hard edged. </p> <p>As the week ended, three separate conclusions were being drawn. The first was that the financial landscape had changed - probably for ever. After the high-profile cull, there would undoubtedly be fewer banks and the ones that survived would operate differently. The second was that the era of deregulation would be replaced by re-regulation. Schumer suggested that the US was starting to look like France, and it wasn't meant as a compliment. </p> <p>Finally, while the measures taken this week may mark the beginning of the end of the financial crisis that erupted in August 2007, the economic effects will be felt for months if not years. \"These are the most difficult circumstances since the Great Depression,\" said Mark Gertler, a professor of economics at New York University. \"The landscape is changing.\" In the UK, hedge fund dealers and short-sellers found themselves pilloried by the tabloids. It was, in short, a week like no other. </p> <p>It is often said how ordinary a day seemed, even as extraordinary events were about to unfold and so it was on Monday in New York, a gloriously sunny morning that gave no clue of the storm about to be unleashed on Wall Street. </p> <p>Lehman Brothers, the fourth largest investment bank, had filed for bankruptcy in the early hours after frantic talks to find a buyer had failed over the weekend. The firm, which was 158 years old, had made losses of $3.9bn in the third quarter alone after writing down bad investments in mortgages and commercial real estate. </p> <p>Paulson spent the weekend trying to broker a takeover of Lehman, but intensive talks with Barclays and Bank of America fell apart because of the refusal of the US government to offer any kind of guarantee for the liabilities on the investment bank's books. Having rescued Bear Stearns in March, the message was that some banks were not too big to fail after all. </p> <p>The Fed had agreed to absorb $29bn of losses to avoid the bankruptcy of the Bear and the government had also stepped in with a $200bn bailout of the mortgage finance giants, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac just a week before Lehman faced bankruptcy. But Paulson had decided that enough was enough: the political will to risk any more taxpayers' money had temporarily evaporated and Lehman was left to go to the wall, the biggest bankruptcy in American history. </p> <p>For chief executive Richard Fuld, who had been with the firm for his entire career and who bragged that he bled green - the Lehman corporate colour - it was a personal disaster. The date was emblazoned on a digital screen fixed to the front of Lehman's glass and steel tower, September 15; the day the world changed. \"Nobody in the office thought we would go bankrupt,\" said one London trader at the firm. </p> <p>The trading screens on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange were lacerated with red. Panic set in and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the index of leading shares, plummeted 504 points, the biggest one-day fall since the first day of trading after the terrorist attacks seven years earlier. In the UK, the chancellor, Alistair Darling, knew that the collapse of Lehman and the hastily arranged shotgun wedding between Bank of America and Merrill Lynch meant trouble. The Treasury knew that the gale would blow across the Atlantic and batter a big British bank and they had an inkling that that bank would be HBOS (Halifax Bank of Scotland) - heavily exposed to the plunging UK housing market and unable to access finance through the ossified wholesale money markets. Darling was right; as the markets tanked on Monday, HBOS was one of the biggest casualties.</p> <p>The next stage of the drama began on Monday night, when Brown met Sir Victor Blank, chairman of Lloyds TSB, at a party hosted by Citigroup. Both men had seen a 17% fall in the share price of HBOS that day. Both knew a crisis was brewing at Britain's biggest mortgage lender. Words were exchanged; Lloyds was, in effect, being given clearance by the government to buy HBOS and to bypass the competition authorities.</p> <p>An outline of the plan had been worked on for weeks by two of Brown's closest aides - Jeremy Heywood, the permanent secretary at No 10, and business minister Lady Vadera. On Tuesday morning, as HBOS shares plunged again, falling 40% at their worst point, Eric Daniels, Lloyds TSB's chief executive, phoned Downing Street.</p> <p>HBOS's submission was inevitable. Its pleas that its capital position was \"strong\" had been ignored by the market. Worse, savers were beginning to withdraw money. At least \u00a31bn had been taken out on Monday, a small fraction of HBOS's total deposit base, but alarming nonetheless.</p> <p>The task of Andy Hornby, chief executive, was to secure the best possible price for his shareholders. The bank had raised \u00a34bn from its shareholders in June at 275p, so a take-out price below that level would be a humiliation for HBOS. Hornby and his chairman, Lord Stevenson, set themselves the goal of 300p-a-share, a price Lloyds initially appeared to be prepared to pay. Markets, once again, intervened. On Wednesday morning, HBOS's shares fell heavily, hitting 80p at their lowest point. The horrible prospect of a run on the bank was now a real possibility. Officials at No 10 decided the secret negotiations had to be made public immediately. The BBC broke the story soon after 9am and named a price of 300p. Official confirmation, via the Stock Exchange, came only at 1.25pm.</p> <p>Key members of the two banks' board agreed to meet. Daniels and Blank argued that 300p was too high a price for Lloyds to pay. Soon after 9pm, the deal was signed. With little negotiating power, Hornby and Stevenson had agreed to sell HBOS for 232p-a-share, or \u00a312.2bn. </p> <p>But Downing Street had extracted a pound of flesh. Lloyds could avoid a competition inquiry but it had to give the government something in return. The formal announcement on Thursday morning made the deal clear. Lloyds' new mortgage lending would \"continue at least at current levels and will expand as market conditions improve\". In addition, the \"management focus is to keep jobs in Scotland,\" said the announcement. Savage cost cuts from a government-brokered takeover in his own backyard as the Labour party conference began would have been difficult to contemplate. </p> <p>While the race was on to save Britain's biggest mortgage lender, AIG, the world's largest insurance group and sponsor of Manchester United, was scrambling for financial help. Its shares fell 61% in a single day as the Fed worked to raise a $75bn loan from the private sector. AIG had in recent years expanded rapidly into insurance contracts to investors who bought the complex mortgage debt securities. It was determined that a collapse of the firm would be catastrophic, setting off a deadly chain reaction because it was so deeply rooted in the financial system. </p> <p>AIG failed to find a white knight and time was running out. At 6.30pm on Tuesday, Paulson and Bernanke met with House and Senate leaders on Capitol Hill to deliver the bad news. After initially refusing to put more taxpayer money on the line, the Fed had reversed course, taken control of the firm and injected $85bn. </p> <p>Hyan Song Shin, professor of economics at Princeton, said the level of government intervention had reached astonishing levels. \"We have run out of superlatives. But it does show quite an adaptability and a pragmatism, which is actually quite refreshing.\" </p> <p>Uwe Reinhardt, also at Princeton, was less kind. \"This fiasco may conceivably trigger a major shift in American, and possibly British, popular beliefs. Gone will be the mindless belief in the mantra that the private sector will always do what's best for America and is self-regulating. How could one still defend that proposition?\" </p> <p>Wall Street appeared calmer but the banks were paralysed with fear. The cost of overnight lending, the short-term loans that oil the financial markets, rose to unprecedented levels as banks became even more wary of each other, despite the central banks pumping billions more into the system. </p> <p>By Wednesday the Dow was plummeting again, 449 points. \"It is just total chaos and uncertainty,\" said one trader, the next day. \"With the AIG bailout, you would think the market should be up.\" The pace of events still didn't slow. The savings bank Washington Mutual put itself up for sale. It also emerged that Morgan Stanley was in talks to merge with the commercial bank Wachovia and other potential partners, as its shares fell to 10-year lows, leaving Goldman Sachs as the sole remaining independent investment bank. </p> <p>By the end of the week, analysts were trying to work out what will happen next. Some changes looked glaringly obvious. The practice of short-selling, betting that a share price will drop, the \"spivs\" and \"speculators\", in the words of Scotland's first minister Alex Salmond, was temporarily banned on both sides of the Atlantic.</p> <p>There were also fears for the wider impact on the twin capitals of finance. About 5% of the jobs in New York are in financial services but they account for about a quarter of wages. Even before the events of the weekend NY had lost 11,000 banking jobs and London some 20,000. In London, there has been a boom in building new office space, some 80% of which is speculative and now could be left empty. </p> <p>\"In my view, the kindest thing one could say about American bankers, and their copycats at UBS etc, is that they were reckless,\" says Reinhardt. \"Our financial sector has arguably visited more harm on our economy than bin Laden could ever have dreamt of inflicting.\"</p> <h2>Just who is to blame for this mess?</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <strong>Alan Greenspan </strong>The alleged grandfather of the credit binge that gave rise to the current crisis. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <strong>Ben Bernanke</strong> Raised interest rates so fast and so far that it triggered millions of home repossessions. <br><strong>\u00b7</strong> <strong>The Bush government </strong>Allowed huge mortgage boom with little regulation. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <strong>Short-sellers </strong>Hedge funds that bet against the survival of banks.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <strong>Henry Paulson</strong> US treasury secretary may have wielded big bucks in recent weeks, but he bet last year that Wall Street could sort out its own mess.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <strong>Bob Diamond</strong> Head of Barclays investment banking business.

  "<p>Interest rates on fixed rate mortgages are expected to rise by around 0.25% over the next few days as the turmoil in global markets takes its toll on mortgage providers. </p> <p>Yesterday GE Money, part of the giant US General Electric group, raised interest rates on its mortgages by 1.6%. \"The events of the last week have been unprecedented, and our cost of funds has gone through the roof,\" said a spokesman. </p> <p>One of the last remaining providers of mortgages to people who have had credit problems in the past, GE Money will start charging 9.3% on home loans, with a minimum deposit of 20%. </p> <p>The financial firestorm that engulfed first Lehman Brothers and then HBOS this week has pushed up the price of money that banks borrow from each other. Fixed rate mortgages are priced according to the interbank lending rate, known as Libor, which this week jumped by 0.3%. Another key influence on mortgage pricing, swap rates, rose by 0.22% yesterday alone.</p> <p>Ray Boulger of mortgage brokers John Charcol said: \"We will see a lot of lenders putting up fixed rates and some tracker rates in the coming days.\" Arrangement fees, which in many cases are now \u00a31,000, may also rise. Many of the most competitive rates are expected to be withdrawn on Monday and Tuesday. </p> <p>The rise in rates reverses a gentle easing over the past month, in which lenders had begun to offer more competitive deals amid a sense that the worst of the credit crunch may have passed. </p> <p>Richard Morea of London &amp; Country Mortgages said: \"If the spike in Libor continues, we are likely to see lenders raise rates across the board. There's a lot of fear out there.\" </p> <p>But in the medium term, economists are predicting that the Bank of England will reduce interest rates, as combating a recession becomes more important than fighting inflation. Most analysts are pencilling in a cut in the base rate of at least 1% over the next year, taking rates to 4% and suggesting that home buyers should shun fixed rates in favour of tracker rates. </p> <p>Brokers say they have been startled by how rapidly some lenders have walked away from deals. Borrowers who expected to complete on home purchases this week were told their approved mortgage applications were now being terminated. </p> <p>But brokers praised Halifax this week while it was besieged by City speculators and hastily arranging a rescue deal with Lloyds TSB. \"It didn't withdraw any products or halt lending. Everything went through as normal. A few clients raised concerns... but nobody decided to pull out of an ongoing mortgage arrangement with Halifax,\" said Morea.</p>",
  "<h2>Nigel Lawson</h2> <p><strong>Former chancellor of the exchequer</strong></p> <p>So far, the events of the past week have demonstrated that the world has not changed. Contrary to Gordon Brown's boast that he had abolished \"boom and bust\", it must now be clear even to him that the cycle is ineradicable. The only consequence of an unusually extended boom is an unusually painful bust. The capitalist system will survive, as it has past cycles. But lessons do need to be learned. The system of UK bank supervision that Mr Brown put in place in 1997 is seriously defective - more so even than its predecessor was. While the cycle is ineradicable, policies and structures designed to limit the unsustainable excesses of a boom can reduce its severity in future.</p> <h2>Martin Sorrell</h2> <p><strong>CEO, WPP Group</strong></p> <p>We had our annual strategy meeting in New York this week and you could smell the fear. It was shocking to see major financial institutions that people thought were invincible going down and being bailed out. We have yet to see what impact this will all have on the \"real\" world. It must undermine the confidence that was there before, but there are still limited indications of tightening in the real world, and this has been confined to date to the US and western Europe.</p> <p>While financial recovery may take longer as a result of the events of the last couple of weeks, we still believe that confidence may return fairly rapidly when the time is right; perhaps that will be in the middle of next year. The impact on the real world should be positive around six to 12 months later, into 2010. We shall see. </p> <p>The irony is the extent to which the US government has had to come to the rescue and provide a socialist solution to capitalistic problems. Just shows the advantage in certain circumstances of state directed capitalism.</p> <h2>Norman Lamont</h2> <p><strong>Former chancellor of the exchequer</strong></p> <p>What is now happening is potentially the most serious crisis since the 1920s. But this is not just a crisis spreading from the US. We have had our own bubble, particularly in housing and personal debt. We face several years of painful adjustment, and the effects will spread inevitably to the wider economy, but eventually it will end. What would be a big mistake would be for the government to try to stop house prices falling to a more affordable level. </p> <p>The crisis will weaken America's and our own authority. They and we will have less money to spend on defence or misguided wars. </p> <h2>Gavyn Davies</h2> <p><strong>Chairman, Fulcrum Asset Management</strong></p> <p>In sharp contrast to the inaction of other major governments, the US administration, Congress and Federal Reserve seem to have recognised that a readiness to use the power of the public sector balance sheet to provide liquidity to the financial system is better than the alternative. That alternative might have involved widespread bankruptcies among banks, and subsequently a major recession. The announcement of a comprehensive US plan to restore health to the financial system is only the first step on a long road to normalisation, and it will involve a major increase in public debt. But these are not life-threatening issues, and there is time to address them in the cold light of the many days ahead. A failure to take emergency action would have had far more immediate, and probably immeasurably worse, consequences.</p> <h2>Stephen S Roach</h2> <p><strong>Chairman, Morgan Stanley Asia</strong></p> <p>As one of Wall Street's long-standing and more vocal bears, it may seem like the height of irony for me to make the bull case. But there is now a distinct possibility that the current strain of market panic is about to subside. Most of the ingredients are now in place - indiscriminate selling, ridiculously low prices for quality assets, and now the distinct possibility of a massive policy response. For the first time since the so-called sub-prime crisis began some 14 months ago, I am encouraged that the authorities have finally woken up to the gravity of the situation. </p> <p>In the end, panics are always temporary. They just never seem that way at the time. The bad news is that once this panic subsides, a post-bubble world will still have to face stiff headwinds for several years to come. </p> <h2>Joseph Stiglitz</h2> <p><strong>Nobel prize-winning economist </strong></p> <p>In some ways, from an intellectual perspective, this is as important as the Great Depression. The Depression taught us that markets are not self-correcting, at least not in the relevant time frame. This is a failure of microeconomics equivalent to the macroeconomic failures of the 1930s. The financial markets have not done what they are supposed to do, which is to manage risk and allocate capital well. The result is that there are no free-marketeers left. Both the left and the right are arguing that there is a role for government to maintain the economy on an even keel.</p> <h2>Amartya Sen</h2> <p><strong>Nobel prize-winning economist</strong></p> <p>The crisis has led to a new recognition of the old understanding that unrestrained markets can cause havoc. John McCain has blamed the crisis on the \"greed\" of Wall Street. But greed is not a new human phenomenon. The real issue is the opportunity that the economic system gives to businesses to reap from wily greed. If risks from imprudent decisions taken by firms can be passed on to others through subsidiary markets, the penalty of extremism and incompetence is borne by others. We need institutional reform that helps to combine the creative contributions of markets with constructive social intervention, including sensible regulation. That would be a truly positive outcome.</p> <h2>Naomi Klein</h2> <p><strong>Author</strong></p> <p>Nobody should believe the overblown claims that \"free market\" ideology is now dead. During boom times it is profitable to preach laissez-faire, because an absentee government allows speculative bubbles to inflate. When those bubbles burst, the ideology becomes a hindrance, and it goes dormant while government rides to the rescue. But rest assured: the ideology will come roaring back when the bailouts are done. The massive debt the public is accumulating to bail out the speculators will then become part of a global budget crisis that will be the rationalisation for deep cuts to social programmes, and for a renewed push to privatise what is left of the public sector. We will also be told that our hopes for a green future are too costly. If the state can intervene to save corporations that took reckless risks in the housing markets, why can't it intervene to prevent millions of Americans from imminent foreclosure? </p> <p><strong>Interviews by Emily Butselaar</strong></p>",
  "<p>HSBC blamed market turmoil yesterday as it walked away from a $6.3bn (\u00a33.4bn) deal to buy a controlling stake in one of Korea's biggest banks but it raised speculation that it was preparing to pounce on rival banks struggling under the global credit crunch. </p> <p>It abandoned its offer for a 51% stake in Korea Exchange Bank, the country's sixth-biggest commercial bank, after nine months of negotiation with the US private equity firm Lone Star in a deal that has been beset with regulatory delays. </p> <p>Sandy Flockhart, HSBC Asia chief executive, said: \"In the light of developments around the world, not least changes in asset values, we do not believe it would be in the best interests of shareholders to continue to pursue this acquisition.\" </p> <p>HSBC, Britain's biggest bank, has fared better than most rivals during the financial crisis, supported by its global spread and diversified deposit base. Yesterday its share price jumped 15.5% to 919.5p, lifted by the euphoria that spread through the sector after US congressional leaders approved a comprehensive government bail-out package for its struggling banks.</p> <p>Executives have played down speculation that it will seek to gain control of a distressed US commercial or investment bank. Although linked to rumours concerning Morgan Stanley, its strategy has been more focused on building dominant retail franchises in emerging markets. </p> <p>The deal to buy KEB became bogged down in investigations by the Korean authorities into the circumstances of Lone Star's original 2003 purchase of its holding. The Dallas-based Lone Star has battled suspicions that it was able to purchase KEB at a bargain price after allegedly colluding with government officials to understate the bank's financial health. </p> <p>The fund denied any wrongdoing.</p>",
  "<p>The American businessman Stan Kroenke was appointed to the Arsenal board yesterday as the club reported a pre-tax profit of \u00a336.7m for the year ending May 2008.</p> <p>The move will be interpreted by many as an attempt to forestall any takeover bid by the Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov who owns 24% of the club's shares. Kroenke has agreed not to increase his stake, currently 12.4%, beyond 29.9% of Arsenal's share capital in the next year unless a takeover bid is launched by Usmanov or another party, in which case he could do so with the consent of the board. Usmanov had been bound by a six-month agreement preventing him from making a takeover bid for the club but that expired at the end of August.</p> <p>Red &amp; White Holdings, the biggest shareholder and controlled by Usmanov, felt the appointment showed that the board was grooming a \"more acceptable\" figure to buy it out in years to come. It felt that the invitation to the American contrasted with the limited contact it has accorded Red &amp; White over the last year. </p> <p>The Arsenal directors insist they have no intention of turning their back on the club, pointing to the existence of a lock-down agreement, which prohibits share sales to any but \"permitted persons\" before October 2010, as evidence. But Kroenke is on the board despite refusing to sign the lock-down. Indeed, although Kroenke issued a \"no-bid\" statement confirming he would not attempt to buy the club for 12 months, it carried the caveat that he would do so if he obtains the board's consent.</p> <p>Despite the politicking, Kroenke's skills are a good fit with Arsenal's ambitions to match Chelsea's global reach. The owner of several US sports franchises, Kroenke already controls Arsenal's broadband-internet business.</p> <p>\"I hope that my background in sports management will be an asset to Arsenal in its commercial dealings going forward,\" said Kroenke. It is clear from the announcement yesterday of Arsenal's annual results that any extra income will be welcomed. Although pre-tax profit rose on \u00a3223m turnover, the margins have been squeezed by a 13% leap in players' wages to \u00a3101.3m and a \u00a350m increase in debts.</p> <p>Most worrying for Arsenal is the outlook regarding their various property interests. In the last set of accounts the chairman, Peter Hill-Wood, forecast turnover of \u00a3350m from developments at the old stadium site, Highbury Square, and nearby Queensland Road. But it is understood the board has requested daily updates on sales of Highbury Square flats, with one in 12 of those currently marketed unsold.</p> <p>Arsenal's small shareholders believe this is the club's overriding concern. \"It is very clear that the anticipated sale of the Queensland Road site for a hoped-for \u00a380m is not achievable in the current market environment,\" said the Arsenal Supporters' Trust. \"Arsenal acknowledge this by stating that any surplus cash from property sales should be treated as a bonus and previous talk of a \u00a3100m surplus can be firmly dismissed.\"</p>",
  "<p>The British poultry industry is introducing slower growing breeds of chickens in response to consumers' demands for more welfare-friendly farming.</p> <p>Companies behind the breeding stock that supplies annually 860m broilers for the UK table are bringing in the new breeds to take advantage of the burgeoning market, after years of producers being accused of raising hens in as short a time and as cheaply as possible.</p> <p>The RSPCA, which certifies higher welfare standards through its Freedom Food scheme, believes the partial reversal of the faster farming method could lead to a doubling of hens labelled under its scheme, from 5% at the end of 2007 to 10% by the end of this year.</p> <p>Increasing numbers of birds reared indoors now live up to two weeks longer than the five to six weeks allowed them in an industry where only one in 20 birds is raised through an outdoor system via free-range and organic flocks. </p> <p>Typically, consumers pay an extra 60p to \u00a31 for an RSPCA scheme bird. The charity's scheme is the only \"higher welfare\" programme to demand that birds do not grow by more than 45g (1.5oz) a day. This rule was introduced in 2006 and last February toughened to cover a bird's genetic propensity for growth, following suspicions that some producers were simply feeding fast-growing birds less.</p> <p>The RSPCA believes the arrival this year of the \"new\" chickens \"tailored\" to meet these demands will give added impetus to welfare improvements.</p> <p>Marc Cooper, a farm animal scientist with the RSPCA, said the moves were more important than lower density stocking and improved broiler house lighting. \"High growth rate leads to significant health and welfare concerns, including lameness and heart problems. It is such a good issue to tackle yet was one of the hardest to make a move on.\"</p> <p>Aviagen, an industrial chicken breeder, says its newest breed of bird is \"moving in that direction\", and a bird developed by another large breeder, Hubbard, already meets the RSPCA requirements. </p> <p>\"For the biggest global breeders to move in this direction is a real breakthrough,\" Cooper said.</p> <p>The move follows years of campaigning by animal welfare groups and criticism of industrial chicken production by the British TV chefs Jamie Oliver and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall. </p> <p>Breeding firms have been looking to France where a significant part of the market adheres to the Label Rouge production standard, which requires poultry to live mostly outside and for at least 81 days. Indoor broiler hens in the UK are never allowed to live that long but given a slower growth rate, coupled with their active nature, they could have lives that theoretically meet the more demanding welfare standards.</p> <p>The slower growing breeds have been created by mating French birds with animals from the British stock.</p>",
  "<p>Newcastle United visit Upton Park today, a side with whom West Ham currently have so much in common that the conflict come three o'clock will be rightly confined to what occurs in the subsequent 90 minutes. </p> <p>It will not be a clash of ideologies or a confrontation that will tumble through the generations, bad blood begetting bad blood till eventually in a Swiftian dystopia no one can recall what the fighting was really for. Both Kevin Keegan and Alan Curbishley left their respective posts due to perceived boardroom meddling in team affairs as a result of new, continental structures at their clubs. </p> <p>The power of language is such that in spite of the ensuing mayhem the word \"continental\" still suggests a degree of sophistication - \"Oooh, you've got a continental structure\" - why, that seems as glamorous to me as a continental quilt once did, before I had one. Till then I had warmed myself by night beneath a Superman bedspread that was, frankly, itchy, and gazed with envious eyes upon the bunks of chums who drifted into blissful dreams beneath a continental quilt, as if Jean-Luc Godard and Sophia Loren were coaxing them off to nod with nocturnal Gauloises and laconic fellatio. Really it was just some feathers in a bag. </p> <p>Curbishley departed hastily, photographed as they always are in anonymous cars, weary at the wheel, but Keegan, never a man to eschew drama has, with timid recklessness, been dipping in and out of his former job like a tipsy teenager in a provincial bus depot who knows he doesn't have a condom. He may yet re-enter the club for yet another \"second coming\"; he must devour zinc the way Mike Ashley puts away pints. </p> <p>The Toon chairman has been abroad traipsing round Dubai trying to flog his beloved club. Well that strikes me as a bit opportunist - \"What? Man City has been bought by Arabs? Take me to the desert baby!\" I once heard that Nottingham had a demographically improbable girls to boys ratio and so after a gig in the city wandered round the town centre assuming that women would be staggering about all pie-eyed and knickerless, demented and desperate - like Bethlehem after the slaughter of the innocents - but I went home alone. Now Ashley is marching through the kasbahs and bazaars of the Middle East with tears in his eyes clutching a photo of Michael Owen and offering a bargain. </p> <p>In retrospect it seems unwise to have plonked himself in the terraces, illegally downing pints and wearing his King Kev pyjamas because he has abruptly found himself in a situation where he needs to be taken seriously as a businessman. I think it unlikely that a trillionaire sheikh will unthinkingly hand over three hundred million pounds to a bloke who looks like he'd struggle to cut his own toe nails.</p> <p>West Ham's board have at least appointed quickly and my confidence in Gianfranco Zola has grown now that he has been bolstered by the arrival of Steve Clarke who it transpires was earning a fortune at Chelsea. The Blues demanded a Kings Road ransom for his release, which makes me feel emboldened. Obviously the slippery endorsement from the Special One further enhances Clarke's value; Jose Mourinho took time out from managing Internazionale to stick his oar right into Premier League affairs, proving that no matter how far or how busy he is he can still provoke strife in English football. Many Premier League bosses would battle to gain attention if perched nude upon one's lap but Jose barely has to smile from Milan and eyes turn.</p> <p>Zola has likeability, I hope he succeeds and I imagine he'll be warmly received for his first game in charge today and given the current global economic climate it is perhaps apposite that he finds himself at the helm of a sponsorless club. I never particularly liked wearing a replica shirt with XL emblazoned across it as it stirred in me long dormant body image issues, I'd rather we were sponsored by an as yet un-invented company called \"svelte\" or \"dignity\" but in the absence of such elegantly titled commercial enterprises I'd like to support the campaign for the \"Bobby Moore Fund for Cancer Research UK\" logo to be on the West Ham strip for the remainder of the season. It is a great cause, a reminder of a great man and a chance to be proud of the shirt regardless of results. Sign the online petition.</p>",
  "<p>A few weeks ago, I witnessed a small, public impropriety in a committee room in Denver. It didn't, sadly, involve Ben Affleck's thoughts on global poverty, unfolding in another committee room at the time, but it did cause attendees of the Democratic National Convention to stop eating the wasabi peas put out for them and frown at the floor as if hell had opened up.</p> <p>The event was a late-afternoon fringe meeting on veterans' rights and the guest speaker was a congressman closely involved with them. Those present were charity workers, action committee members and parents of dead and injured soldiers, and he addressed this small, serious group about the failure of the Bush government to have adequately helped them. Halfway through the address the congressman stopped. </p> <p>He looked thoughtfully at his audience. And then he began, unexpectedly, to talk about his childhood. He spoke of his father. He spoke of his mother. He spoke of his dreams. It was as if someone had grabbed the wheel in his brain and yanked him off the highway up a dirt track, where after a long ride through his formative years we all found ourselves on the floor of his family home. His father, who was himself a veteran, lay \"weak and dying\" after a cardiac arrest, and if the congressman had started singing Dolly Parton's Coat of Many Colours no one would have been surprised. \"My father's last word,\" he said, wiping a tear, \"was 'uniform'.\" </p> <p>Then he coughed and stepped down. It took a few seconds for people to notice, because they were mostly looking at their feet.</p> <p>Everyone wants a podium moment, in life as in politics, but it's so de rigueur in America right now that even the most humdrum encounter is vulnerable to sudden crackpot bids for self-dramatisation. At the convention it was obviously an Obama thing; the proximity to the senator's brilliance inspired a lot of ill-judged rhetorical tribute acts. </p> <p>More generally, the logic that sentiment enlivens knowledge has extended to the terrifying principle that sentiment equals knowledge. People might turn up thinking they want to hear about reforms in disability benefit, but what they really want is a one-man show.</p> <p>When I was at university I spent a week studying Toni Morrison's novel Beloved. It was interesting, said my tutor, to watch students from privileged backgrounds get busy empathising with the slaves, when historically they might identify more easily with the slave owners. It was right, of course, that they felt the way they did, but it was also the laziest, most self-involving way to engage with the text and the history of slavery. People who bang on endlessly about empathy are often the worst narcissists; the \"I feel your pain\" brigade, who feel your pain, one suspects, the way a groper on the tube feels your bum. </p> <p>Tania Head, the 9/11 survivor of whom it has been alleged that she was not on the 78th floor of the South Tower on September 11th as she claimed, but may have been in Spain at the time, perhaps took this principle to an absurd degree. </p> <p>But well below the level of mental illness a lot of low-level fakery is actively embraced and rewarded. </p> <p>It is particularly prevalent in America, where to be fully inside the tent, you must also prove that you are to some extent outside it. (Not too far outside; that would make you a Mexican. Or a woman Democrat). </p> <p>The bloggers at the Democratic convention faced the hilarious quandary of enjoying the perks of sponsorship - the free smoothies and massage booths that jammed up their press tent - while also revelling in their superior \"renegade\" status over the old media hacks. (Who chewed sawdust in their unsponsored tent and complained about \"citizen journalists\" uploading fluff from their navels and calling it journalism). </p> <p>Getting accreditation was so laborious that anyone present was by definition \"inside\". Outside the convention hall meanwhile, in the bars and restaurants, a lot of Ivy League-educated political tourists could be found striking romantic poses and talking about the difficulty of the (spiritual) journey they had made to get there. Finally, after years of hard graft in the goldmines of privilege, they were feeling the delicious pinch of outsidership.</p> <p>And now we have Sarah Palin, who in matters of gender, geography and even vocabulary is the antidote to all those smug elitists; her use of the word \"verbage\" to describe John McCain's - what? speech? Ideas? The vegetable matter of his brain? - in a TV interview this week proof that she brings to the job the excellent qualification of having been alive for 44 years.</p> <p>The worst thing about Palin is that everyone knows; the Republicans know and they know that we know that picking her for vice-president was like a petulant child's response to being told to do something - and then doing it with satirical mimicry. </p> <p>You wanted a woman? Well we gave you a woman. And she even claims to be a feminist! (Which if you call her stupid is more than you'll ever be). In fact, all Palin's candidacy confirms is that women only get ahead in politics by betraying their own interests, or the interests of their 17-year-old daughters. </p> <p>Earlier this year, a bogus financier called Clarke Rockefeller donned a joke-shop disguise and snatched his daughter Snooks off a street corner. A classic impostor, he seemed to be labouring under the delusion that life is a 1930s screwball comedy. But fakery no less shameless goes on every day in the political debate and the way we the audience internalise it. McCain flatly contradicts himself within the space of a single day, so that you want to scream at him, words have meaning! (Not \"verbage\" though.) Rich people like Cindy McCain ham up their grandparents' long ago poverty as a shortcut to virtue. </p> <p>And sober bureaucrats mistake a common interest for an interest in them.</p> <p>After the congressman at the convention stepped down from the podium, he received a light smatter of applause and the crowd dispersed, looking bemused.</p> <p>They really had, it seemed, wanted to hear about reforms in disability benefit.</p>",
  "<p>Many leading hedge funds, including some of the most active short-sellers, have reluctantly accepted the need for emergency measures outlawing aggressive bets on falling bank share prices.</p> <p>The temporary ban on such activity took effect on stock markets in London and New York yesterday after a week in which short-sellers became the subject of a volley of angry criticism accusing them of manipulating the markets.</p> <p>Florence Lombard, chief executive of the hedge fund trade body, the Alternative Investment Management Association, said: \"We strongly support measures put forward by regulators and policymakers that will bring equilibrium to financial markets.\"</p> <p>But she warned that the authorities had not yet addressed the underlying frailties of bank stocks. \"It is our position that the ban - while it may indeed bring temporary relief - creates an artificial market. It will not ultimately, on its own, bring back investor confidence in the banking system.\"</p> <p>Her comments come after a week in which senior figures from the political and banking establishment - as well as many newspaper front pages - angrily pointed the finger at hedge funds, many of them based in Mayfair. </p> <p>The outbursts came before yesterday's extraordinary stock market recovery during four days of panic trading that saw prices reach levels that bore no relation to the underlying value of listed companies. Shares, particularly bank shares, were ditched at unbelievably low prices as investors stampeded into the perceived safe havens of gold and government bonds. As the week wore on, however, the markets have begun to show indicative data that tells a surprising tale of relatively modest short-selling activity around the most controversial stocks during the past week. </p> <p>While the figures do point to a late rush of shorting around certain stocks, in many cases these bets look small in comparison with huge short selling activity in preceding months. The latest stock loan data from research group Dataexplorers.com - the best available proxy indicator for short-selling - suggests hedge funds this month increased their short positions in Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, and Goldman Sachs. But in all cases these late bets were a fraction of the scale of short selling seen over the summer. </p> <p>At HBOS even after very modest short-selling activity early in the week, the figures suggest hedge funds were choosing to bet more on a fall in Barclays share price than in HBOS. Some late short-selling in HBOS appears now to be loss-making.</p> <p>Many hedge fund experts refuse to accept that short-selling had caused falls in stock markets around the world this week, nor do they believe that yesterday's record stock market rally had to be the result of the emergency ban on short-selling. One industry insider said yesterday's markets were being driven by radical proposals being drawn up in the US for a state rescue of the mortgage market.</p> <p>Not all fund managers absolved short-sellers from responsibility for recent market turmoil. Guy de Blonay, who runs New Star's \u00a3250m Global Financials fund, said: \"I'm a hedge fund manager myself, and it will have an impact on what I do. But I can see the national interest and the ramifications for the wider economy. It will help stop a vicious cycle that is forcing one weak entity after the next to sell itself. </p> <p>At the very least it will delay the worst case scenario.\"</p> <h2>At a glance</h2> <p>Short sellers pay a small fee to borrow shares, and immediately sell them in the hope the shares can eventually be bought back at a lower price before they have to be returned to the lender. The difference between sale and purchase prices is the shorter's profit. When the market tumbles this can be huge - and provoke a public backlash</p> <p>Many hedge funds choose to buy shares they believe are undervalued and short-sell those shares they judge to be overpriced. Expressing their views in this manner helps the market find the right price for a stock, they argue.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Tonight</strong></p> <p><strong>John Denham</strong> will address the <strong>Compass/Tribune rally</strong> explaining how the party needs to go \"beyond redistribution\" to achieve social justice.

  "<p>Tony Blair has submitted himself, over the past 48 hours, to questioning of his record in government by two vastly different institutions in American public life. He first faced the caustic probing of a TV presenter, and hours later the theorising of Ivy League professors .</p> <p>The soft-soap treatment was granted to him yesterday by staff of Yale university, who soothed him with an hour-long session that began by introducing him as \"Mr prime minister\" and ended with the question: \"Rolling Stones or the Beatles?\"</p> <p>Before a packed audience of more than 2,000 faculty and students at the university's august Wolsey Hall, the event opened a new chapter of Blair's public life - as teacher. Under his new title as Howland Distinguished Fellow, Blair has agreed to participate in a term-long series of seminars on faith and globalisation.</p> <p>He told the college paper, the Yale Daily News, this week that he was \"a bit nervous\" about the course, his first foray into teaching. \"I was never a star student, and I'm coming along mixing with a whole lot of people who I'm sure are a whole lot more clever and smarter than I am.\"</p> <p>A touch of nerves was evident, too, on Thursday night when Blair faced a wholly more formidable inquisition, that of the satirical Daily Show, presented by Jon Stewart. Blair came across as tense and a tad tetchy in front of cameras in New York as he was hit by a stream of barbed comments from Stewart on his friendship with George Bush and the Iraq war.</p> <p>Stewart, who enjoys a television following as one of the sharpest political observers in the US, began by reflecting on the coincidence of the Yale posting with the economic meltdown on Wall Street. \"You've picked the perfect time to come and work in America. Did you get your money up front?\"</p> <p>\"Yes,\" Blair replied.</p> <p>When the interview turned to the subject of the US president, Blair was unable to disguise his discomfort. \"Your relationship with George Bush seems - what's the word I'm looking for? - inexplicable,\" Stewart said, prompting a roar from the live audience.</p> <p>Blair winced and said: \"Here's something I find always goes down well, particularly back home: I like him.\"</p> <p>\"I would probably like him too if he wasn't in charge of me,\" Stewart fired back. He added: \"It's like we're talking about the bad boy at school, and you're saying, 'You don't know him like I know him'.\"</p> <p>\"I'm not a fairweather friend. We've been through a lot together,\" Blair replied.</p> <p>Blair faced a similar barrage of cutting quips on his decision to back Bush over the invasion of Iraq. Asked whether he still felt it was a smart strategic move to topple Saddam, Blair conceded that he had not anticipated the maelstrom to come.</p> <p>\"If you look at the bloodshed there's been, and the difficulty, I would have been shocked, but I would have asked why has this come about? There's a fundamental struggle going on I'm afraid, and there are two sides.\"</p> <p>He insisted he had come to the view that the Iraq war was necessary \"of my own accord and from my own conviction\". But he added it was not a decision he took lightly. \"None of this is easy,\" he said.</p> <p>Since he departed Downing Street last year Blair has looked to the international stage in his search for a new role. He has taken on responsibilities as an envoy to the Middle East and as a participant in negotiations over climate change.</p> <p>Blair, 55, has also modelled his activities on the post-presidential activities of his friend Bill Clinton, whose global foundation bears a close resemblance to the Tony Blair Faith Foundation that was set up in May.</p> <p>At Yale, he will be attending five two-hour seminars, the first of which fell yesterday on the subject of \"stakes in faith and globalisation\". Hundreds of Yale students applied for the course.</p> <p>As for that last question, Blair said in his youth he always professed to be a Rolling Stones fan to keep his girlfriends happy. But in truth it was the Beatles.</p> <h2>Daily Show excerpts</h2> <p><strong>On the Yale appointment </strong></p> <p>Jon Stewart: May I ask you this sir, did you get your money up front?</p> <p>Tony Blair: Er, yes. </p> <p>Stewart: American dollars or Euros?</p> <p>Blair: I'm sort of working on that one. British pounds will do just fine.</p> <p><strong>On George Bush</strong></p> <p>Stewart: Did he [Bush] understand the time difference or did he call you up and it would be like, four in the morning and he'd be like, \"Tony, you gotta turn on Channel 4 there's a snake eating an egg!\" How did it go?</p> <p>Blair: It was okay, I got used to that.</p> <p><strong>On Britain</strong></p> <p>Stewart: Listen I'm a big fan. I love the Beatles and all that sort of thing. I know you have question time where you go in front of parliament and they all yell at each other.</p> <p>Blair: Well it's a little more sophisticated than that, we like to think!</p> <p>Stewart: Not the episodes I've seen!</p> <p><strong>On the Iraq war</strong></p> <p>Blair: Al-Qaida ... are precisely those forces of terrorism [in Iraq] based on a perversion of Islam and Iranian-backed militia, and they're the people fighting in Afghanistan, and whether it's in the Yemen or Algeria or Palestine or Pakistan, there's a struggle going on. </p> <p>Stewart: ... what was that list? </p> <p>Blair: No, I'm not saying you have to take military action on all of them! </p> <p>Stewart: So it's one country at a time? </p> <p>Blair: No, no I don't say that ...</p>",

  "<p>In August 1968, as Warsaw Pact tanks rumbled through Czechoslovakia snuffing out the Prague Spring, playwright Vaclav Havel and the actor Jan Triska made a last free television broadcast from Jested, the tallest hill overlooking the town of Liberec, an hour north of Prague. At their backs was a building site where a very strange tower was taking shape. Now, 40 years later, I'm standing under this tower in a light drizzle in the same spot, utterly beguiled.</p> <p>As someone who likes his mountains unadulterated, I have to make an exception for the Jested Tower. It looks like a set for Thunderbirds, except it's real and you can sleep here in Lady Penelope comfort. The 20 rooms are spaceship cabins, with a sloping exterior wall like the Apollo capsule. I lay in bed counting down to blast-off. The interiors, despite being redecorated in the early 1990s, retain much of their early 1970s pomp. There's a restaurant, bar and gift shop; lots of chunky glass and chrome, hanging-egg chairs - the whole place just screams \"Yeah, baby!\".</p> <p>This region is popular with Czech tourists escaping the city for the day, but doesn't see too many foreigners. Czechs come here for the well-marked hiking trails that criss-cross the 20-mile ridge Jested sits upon, and to rummage in the beech forests for mushrooms. In winter there are cross-country ski trails - next year the region hosts a round of the world cup - and some short downhill pistes. And over it all stands the tower, like an exclamation mark.</p> <p>Most Brits go to Prague for some Bohemian baroque and a cheap pint of lager, but it isn't all castles and God. The post-war period was abundantly rich in the creative arts, which is why work by Czech designers and architects features prominently in the V&amp;A's new exhibition Cold War Modern. The show's curator, Jane Pavitt, is on hand to share her enthusiasm for modern Czech design that despite political restrictions - or perhaps because of them - flourished so productively. </p> <p>Over dinner - a heaped plate of duck and dumplings - Otakar Binar, the tower's interior designer, described the challenges of sticking what looks like an 88m spaceship on top of a pointy mountain. Previously, the site was occupied by a romantic pile of a hotel with a looming tower, but it burned down in 1963, so the authorities launched a competition to design a replacement along with a new communications tower.</p> <p>The architect Karel Hubacek then broke the competition's rules by combining both in one building and he won. Building it was another matter. Czechoslovakia's centrally-planned industry couldn't cope with such an innovative project. So Hubacek and his colleagues, including Binar, quit their government jobs and set up the design collective SIAL to manage the build. Then they went hunting for materials.</p> <p>There can't be many construction jobs where the national angling federation gets a credit for supplying fishing rods. But, as the hotel's manager shows us, there they are. The tower needed a lightweight frame to support fibreglass panels covering the television transmitters. Metal was no good because it interfered with the signal. Hubacek was a keen angler, and figured carbon-fibre rods, normally used for fishing, would do the job. </p> <p>That wasn't the only example of engineering chutzpah. Motorbike suspensions - lots of them - helped dampen the movement of the tower in high winds. Car-seat fabric lines the walls. Binar also adds that when the state chair companies said they couldn't make the conical bar stools he wanted, he commissioned a trumpet manufacturer instead.</p> <p>After the Soviet Union crushed dissent, the SIAL collective was out of favour and Binar never got to work on such an exceptional project again. When Hubacek's creation won the Auguste Perret Prize in 1969, he was prevented from leaving the country to accept it. But at least it's lasted longer than the occupation, despite being a little frayed round the edges. Loathed by the locals when it opened in 1973, it is now a treasured landmark, and from a distance looks like a Thai stupa, completing the summit of the peak. They're hoping Unesco will designate it a world heritage site.</p> <p>Views from the mountain summit are colossal, stretching northwest into Germany towards Dresden and northeast into Silesia. Across the Polish border, far enough away not to mar the view, is a gigantic coal-fired power station that once blighted the region with acid rain. If architecture really does illustrate the morale of a nation, then Czechoslovakia in the 1960s was heading for the stars. But by the 70s the socialist consumerist dream was fading. Environmental degradation caused by heavy industry was impossible to ignore. No surprise then that Charter 77, the dissident group Vaclav Havel helped establish, campaigned for the environment, as well as human rights. Locals showed us where the trees around Jested had died back and are now regenerating. Jested is once again a beautiful place to take a walk.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Cold War Modern: Design 1945-70 opens at the V&amp;A in London Sept 25 (<a href=\"http://www.vam.ac.uk\">vam.ac.uk</a>). <a href=\"http://www.Jet2.com\">Jet2.com</a>, <a href=\"http://www.easyjet.com\">easyjet.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bmibaby.com\">bmibaby.com</a> fly to Prague from various UK airports.

But if luxury villas built for film stars and bigwigs are too elitist, then the post-war apartments at Invalidovna in northeast Prague will restore your proletarian equilibrium. The lower floor was devastated during floods in 2002, but these early 1960s flats for 4,000 people, designed by Josef Polak and the Prague Design Institute, remain a vibrant community, unlike the larger projects that came in their wake. </p> <p>Stay at the <strong>Hotel Jalta</strong> on Wenceslas Square (<a href=\"http://www.jalta.cz\">jalta.cz</a>) for some socialist realist charm; it used to be favoured by foreign journalists and was consequently stuffed with listening devices.

Czech design impressed the world in 1958 and this building was the centrepiece. Taken apart and then reassembled in Prague, it was a restaurant for many years, now it's home to an advertising company who really don't like visitors. But hey, that's capitalism for you.</p>",
  "<h2>Can my pension go bust?</h2> <p>Those with private sector employers or who are self-employed - and that's most of us - have every right to be worried. Your fund could be hit by financial market turbulence or by your employer becoming insolvent. </p> <p>You are most at risk if you have a final salary scheme - in the past, many funds have been grabbed by the directors to bolster failing companies.</p> <p>But if you work for the government, or any other body backed by the state, you're laughing. </p> <p>Government pensions are paid out of tax money - there is no investment fund behind them, so there is nothing to fear. </p> <p>A failure by the state to pay out its own pensioners would herald a financial crisis of Germany in the 1920s, or Zimbabwe more recently, when all bets are off - we'll be too worried about basic needs to be concerned about the niceties of pensions or annuities. </p> <p>Many people are in money purchase plans backed by insurance companies. As AIG has shown, insurers are not immune from credit crisis problems. The ultimate backstop is the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. </p> <h2>When should I worry?</h2> <p>Now. No one knows when, or how, the mayhem will end. </p> <h2>Can my employer run off with my pension fund?</h2> <p>No, if you're in a personal pension such as a stakeholder plan where the assets are held by a life insurance company which ring fences your money. </p> <p>But there is nothing to stop employers from cutting contributions - the only protection you might have is if the contribution is part of your employment contract. </p> <h2>What happens if my final salary fund disappears?</h2> <p>You are in the hands of the Pension Protection Fund. This pays 100% of retirement pay to pensioners and those who retired early on health grounds, and 90% for those who are still working. There is a cap on annual payments set until March 2009 at \u00a330,856 - equal to \u00a327,771 for those on the 90% level.</p> <h2>How can I find out what's in my pension fund?</h2> <p>Those in final salary plans can ask to see the scheme's \"statement of principles\" which details how the fund is spread across various assets such as bonds, equities and property. This SIP is regularly updated. Money purchase schemes should reveal their holdings. </p> <h2>Is my pension full of those derivatives that no one understands?</h2> <p>Final salary plans will probably have at least some of the complex alphabet soup deals that have brought Wall Street to its knees. The National Association of Pension Funds says these are for \"efficient risk management\". Others will disagree. Scheme trustees can protest on your behalf - but whether many will understand derivative-based concepts is not clear. The NAPF publication \"Liability-Driven Investment made simple\" is 18 pages long. </p> <h2>What's going to happen to my personal pension?</h2> <p>Those based on equities will have fallen. Bond funds have done relatively well. Many property-based plans are in tatters. Pension plans are ring-fenced from the companies managing them.</p> <h2>Should I continue with my stakeholder plan?</h2> <p>Buying into funds when they are low produces more units so you should gain if and when prices go back up. Bear markets (when shares fall steeply) tend to last around two to three years so perhaps look to 2011. Only stop if you really need the money for day to day living - cutting the plan means you will lose any employer contribution as well as tax relief.</p> <h2>Any safety first strategies?</h2> <p>Personal pension and Sipp holders approaching retirement could move all their funds into cash. A more sophisticated idea, from Norwich Union, is to switch into government and corporate bonds which will match the bonds that will finance your eventual annuity. </p> <h2>How safe is my annuity?</h2> <p>As long as your provider is solvent, you should be fine. But if an insurer goes bust, you can fall back on the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. </p> <h2>Where does this leave my state pension? </h2> <p>You will be paid as normal. But as the annual uplift is based on inflation in September, and price rises are now at a long-term peak, the increase will be greater than in many past years. </p> <h2>Can the compensation scheme itself go bust?</h2> <p>Each year, the FSCS levies firms based on what it thinks it will need. On top of that it can call on a \u00a34.03bn fund levied on all financial services firms. But this might not be enough for a major financial catastrophe - especially in pensions where sums involved can be huge and payable over decades.</p> <h2>A Conservative estimate of the new world order?</h2> <p>Should I be worrying about pensions, anyway? Isn't this the end of global capitalism? Well, we're watching the accelerating collapse of Thatcher-style free market ideology. So who's going to lead us to a new world in which investment bankers are no longer masters of the universe? Step forward the Conservative Party. Yes, that will do it.</p>",

  "<p>This week's financial turbulence provides the starkest demonstration yet that we are living in an era of dramatic global change. Financial markets across the world are in uncharted waters. The British economy prospers as a global hub for investment, trade and services. That openness is a source of strength. But it also means that we cannot insulate ourselves from the contagious effects of the financial crisis in the United States, and the sharp increase in world commodity prices.</p> <p>Nobody should underestimate the severity of this crisis. The US government now owns much of the US mortgage market and a large part of the world's biggest insurer. Two of Britain's biggest banks and mortgage lenders have had to merge. These are events of historic significance, and they demand firm and decisive leadership.</p> <p>That is why all the efforts of our party and our government must be concentrated on the needs of the British people, whose paramount concern is how this week's events will impact upon their families, and how we can help them through this crisis.</p> <p>Just as when we stopped Northern Rock going to the wall, we took the necessary and decisive action this week to protect stability and keep the financial system moving. We have acted to secure people's savings, support the housing market, and underpin liquidity in the banking sector. And with our support, the Financial Services Authority has banned short-selling of financial stocks.</p> <p>I would have liked a national consensus on that measure but - as with Northern Rock - the Conservatives offer partisan criticism. While much of their image has changed, the Conservatives' instinct is still for government to walk away rather than intervene. Last year they even proposed to abolish mortgage regulations, saying the banks should be left to their own devices and simply \"nudged\" to act responsibly. You cannot \"nudge\" your way through a financial crisis.</p> <p>In days of higher growth we reduced the national debt to give us the flexibility to increase borrowing in these hard times. Thus we are able to give a \u00a3120 tax cut to every basic-rate taxpayer, increase our winter fuel payments to pensioners, and step up government funding for homes, schools and hospitals, so that our capital investment, and the jobs that depend on it, continues.</p> <p>The Conservative party's ideological objection to higher borrowing - coupled with its insistence on prioritising a \u00a31bn inheritance tax cut for the top 3,000 estates - would have required it to scale back public services.</p> <p>People are beginning to see again that politics is not a permanent referendum on a government, but a choice between competing philosophies.</p> <p>It is only a Labour government that is able to act now to tackle the instability in the economy and provide the security that businesses and families need. This is a new agenda for an active government that stands for fairness first.</p> <p>But let me be clear: this is not the moment to junk the economic policy framework that has secured sustained growth, high employment and low inflation over the past decade. The progressive British model that New Labour has pioneered has been successful. Our fundamental claim - that it is not just possible but necessary in the modern world to combine economic dynamism and social justice - remains as valid today as in the early 1990s.</p> <p>So while we respond to a world that is changing all around us, our values of fairness and social justice remain our guide. Everything we have done since 1997, and everything we do this week in Manchester, is driven by one thing: our united commitment to fair rules, fair chances, and a fair say for all.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Gordon Brown is the prime minister</p>",
  "<p>The 20th century so privileged eyes and ears that we seldom notice how much more it offered the nose. Chemical experiments in synthesising perfume materials began in the 19th century, when William Perkin, who had already given the world the ample gift of the first aniline dye (mauvine, sluiced out of coal tar waste), discovered how to change the structure of organic compounds at a molecular level. He introduced salicylaldehyde from carbolic acid to acetic anhydride from vinegar and the Perkin reaction filled the lab not with pickled tar but the scent of new-mown hay. What Perkin first inhaled in 1868 replicated the exhalation of tonka beans, a South American spice - in French, coumarou, so Perkin named his odour coumarin. (It's still in Yves Saint Laurent's gorgeous Kouros.)</p> <p>The idea, as with dyes, was the repeatable recreation of reality for a farthing. Perfumery ingredients were expensive because they were obscure, low-yield, vulnerable to bad harvests, trade routes, a clammy cellar. Even when a perfumer scraped civet from the glands of an Ethiopian cat or scooped half a drop of attar from a macerated estate of roses, they were unpredictable. But tinker with the new trinitrotoluene (TNT) as Albert Baur did in 1888 in the expectation of making an even bigger bang - and up comes musk baur, smelling like extract of the pods of Himalayan deer and the droppings of rare Algerian gazelles, but at a thousandth of the price, and reliably perfect every time. And, as Luca Turin explains, get a nose composer to arrange each synthesis - vanilla vanillin (1874), bitter leather quinolines (1880), violet ionones (1893), peachy lactones (1906), and the rest of a list that advances incrementally into the present - add a dab of naturals to a lab of benzene, and what happens goes beyond chemistry into post-representational art.</p> <p>Aim\u00e9 Guerlain, who collaged Jicky in 1889, or his son Jacques, composer of Mitsouko, 1919, bottled the timbre of a time. As Turin writes, Aim\u00e9's 1906 Apr\u00e8s L'Ond\u00e9e (after the rainshower), which he arranged from then-new heliotropin, plus iris, thyme, rosemary and sage, has the \"unresolved but effortless feel of the watery piano chords that make Debussy's pieces so poignant\". Besides being contemporary with Debussy's Images, Apr\u00e8s L'Ond\u00e9e overlaps in more than era with Monet's first waterlily paintings: they are all meditations on the senses and their mortal limitation. The perfume depends on a radical sensibility, as did Debussy's retreat from full romantic orchestra to a fluid solo piano; and on revolutionary science, as did Monet's use of the latest cobalt and manganese pigments to paint the \"true colour of the atmosphere\", violet: \"fresh air is violet\".</p> <p>Turin's entries in his alphabetical guide to fine fragrances are brilliant exercises in synasthaesia; to him, perfume is a hallucinogenic substance that links everything. Each paragraph awarded to a masterpiece mix covers chemistry, biology, composition (with professional footnote on composer), commercial and political history (the European Union polices ingredients if they put the wearer, maker or environment at risk), personal memories, fantasies, and cross-references to arts, high and low. Consider his analysis of Eau Sauvage, by Edmond Roudnitska for Dior in 1966. He references Garamond type, Prokofiev, Jascha Heifetz and his Guarneri violin, pine needles and rosemary, Vietnamese beef salad, Transformer toys and hedione, aka methyl dihydrojasmonate, discovered in 1962 and capable of moistening florals until they feel fresh as dawn. Such a review could be a dog's dinner, or, worse, all that a dog can sniff the length of a back alley, but it's so exact that it's a kick, a written spritz of cologne. I sprayed on Eau Sauvage again, and for the first time could put a name - that salad - to its lime and coriander. </p> <p>Now and again I've consulted online perfume blogs, by addicts for addicts, only to give up because of the ineffability that is their common language. Aromas waft; adjectives shouldn't. The dialect of oenophiles (gooseberries, bananas) is grounded in comparison. If there is to be any hope of persuading people to make perfume as much a quotidian reward as wine and food have become these past 30 years, there has to be a way to write about it that excites us, makes us curious, makes us laugh. Turin has found it. I've just blown all my pocket money on sampling an unknown five-star wonder, Guerlain's Habit Rouge, and it's Turin's fault for describing it as \"soft and rasping, like stubble on a handsome cheek\". (Eau de early Harrison Ford, as it were.) His approach reminds me of the Action Cook Book and Ou est le Garlic?, written and illustrated by Len Deighton in the 1960s and my teen introduction to cuisine. Deighton assumed his readers barely knew where our mouths were and remedied that through gastronomical science essays, comic-strip recipes, and commentaries that shared Turin's multicultural references - fast cars, old planes and actresses who had slept with Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut. A lifetime later I still quote Deighton on the physics of overfrying eggs, and I shall be reciting Turin into old age on Le Feu d'Issey: perfume as a \"portable form of intelligence . . . fresh baguette, lime peel, clean wet linen, shower soap, hot stone, salty skin . . . fly past one's nose at warp speed\". </p> <p>There is a second voice in this book, that of Tania Sanchez. Both authors point out that fragrances aren't aphrodisiacs or sex pheromones, and sulk at the narrow definitions of sexual identity standard in the fragrance trade, but their contributions are terrifically gendered, and that's a compliment. She provides the advice for novices and the true confession that starts with the \"belief that Old Spice/Brut/English Leather is the natural odour that God caused fathers to emit after shaving\" and ends with enlightenment, Chanel's Bois des Iles, equivalent to a little black cashmere dress, which she wore whenever she \"needed extra insulation from the cold world\". </p> <p>For a while I thought she was playing Eva Marie Saint to Turin's Cary Grant, but her voice is faster and wackier than that, more the young Barbara Stanwyck, and there's screwball comedy in their interaction. They disagree about classics; he quotes her approvingly (that salad interpretation is hers), she quotes him disbelievingly; they spar through hundreds of one-word or two-line dismissals of inept pongs - \"burial wreath\", \"grim floral\", \"canned fruit\". </p> <p>Nobody is meant to begin this volume at the dedication, as I did, and keep on going to the glossary, but should you do so, you'll have witnessed a witty courtship conducted through competitive discernment: when I learned they were married, I wasn't a bit surprised. Not after Sanchez's wicked whistle at a slug of Stetson, which is promoted as quintessence of manly Montana but is \"as rugged and masculine as the lingerie level at Saks Fifth Avenue . . . I'd truly love a man who wore this, but in the absence of one, I'll gladly wear it myself.\"</p> <p>Romance with brains needs adversity to flourish, and to create this guide Turin and Sanchez gallantly went through odorous hell. About 40% of concoctions were classified awful or disappointing and another 40% only adequate. High prices, movie star ads, prestigious houses, gifted creators, sculptural flacons, historic longevity, massive sales: none guarantees that the liquid won't smell of mall rat effluvia, sports sneaker juice (\"bloodless, gray, whippet-like, shivering little things\"), Paris Hilton's Just Me (\"barf-bag floral\") or absolutely nothing with a faint hint of melon in the case of L'Eau d'Issey. Sanchez claims everybody knows at least five people who wear this: we may not move in the same circles. Contrariwise, cheapness is no deterrent to sublimity, since 150 years of research have rearranged enough molecules to supply superb macrocyclic musks to manufacturers of laundry detergent. All the way through this book I was saddened, as I am when I see a beautifully designed plastic milk bottle, that we don't respect the scents, dyes and objects created from carbons bequeathed by long-set suns, just because they've been dirt cheap for 40 years. </p> <p>Turin and Sanchez are not conventional snobs. Besides the Guerlain family, who have been getting it mostly right since Jicky, the most laudatory entries are for Est\u00e9e Lauder, \"faithful keeper of one of the most consistently high-quality lines of fragrances ever created\". I'd never thought of sniffing her commissioned brews until I wrote her obituary and wanted to understand why Youth Dew, which she spilt on the carpet at the Galeries Lafayette as an olfactory calling card, had made her fortune. I bought samples of Lauder greats, which turned out to be Paris as imagined by the art department at MGM, a distillation of yearning more potent than the real thing. </p> <p>The least expensive preparation in this book rates its most tender, five-star review: Caldey Island Lavender, by Hugo Collumbien, now in his 90s, for the South Wales monastery. Turin says its gently handled linalool, lavender's 10-carbon alcohol, results in \"endlessly blue daylight air\": it reminds me of Vermeer's use of the precious pigment ultramarine, made from lapis lazuli and traditionally reserved for the Virgin Mary's robe, on the apron of a servant pouring milk. A blessing for the daily round and common task, anyway: \u00a37.75 a bottle.</p>",
  "<p>This year marks the 50th anniversary of the Radiophonic Workshop, the BBC's experimental unit for electronic sound. It also marks the 10th anniversary of the workshop's death after a long period of decline. But almost as soon it was gone, it began to assume cult status. A Radiophonic ghost began to haunt the peripheries of pop culture, audible initially as an influence on \"retrofuturist\" groups such as Boards of Canada, Broadcast and Add N to (X). In the past five years, there has been a steady flow of Radiophonic-related reissues from labels such as Mute, Rephlex, Glo-Spot and Trunk; a BBC4 documentary, Alchemists of Sound; and a South Bank symposium organised by Saint Etienne's Bob Stanley. There have been two plays about the workshop's Delia Derbyshire, and when Doctor Who was relaunched in 2005, unfavourable comparisons were made between the Radiophonic team's original electronic music and the orchestrated flatus of Murray Gold's updated version. This summer, the Southbank Centre held a symposium on Daphne Oram, the workshop's co-founder, and there was news about the discovery of a huge cache of unreleased material by Derbyshire, the workshop's most brilliant composer. In November, Mute is set to issue a double CD compilation, 50th Anniversary Retrospective, including nuggets never before released.</p> <p>The workshop is still best known for Doctor Who - not just the theme tune, but the array of sound effects that made the show so creepy, from spooky winds evoking the poisonous atmospheres of alien planets to the grotesque squelches of a slime monster crawling up Sarah Jane Smith's leg. Yet Doctor Who represented just a tiny fraction of the outfit's output, which covered radio plays, TV series and educational programming, countless jingles and theme tunes, and a number of major productions initiated by the workshop itself. Especially through its contributions to programmes for schools, the workshop filtered into the collective unconscious of young Britons during the 60s and 70s. \"We were part of your life,\" says Brian Hodgson, who created \"special sound\" for Doctor Who for its first 11 years - including such \"classics\" as the Tardis taking off and the voice of the Daleks. The workshop could be one reason why Britain has played such a vanguard role in the rise of electronic music, from 80s synthpop to 90s techno-rave. </p> <p>The workshop opened for business in a couple of rooms at the BBC's Maida Vale complex on April 1 1958. For several years before that, Oram had been pushing for the BBC to start its equivalent to French national radio's audio research unit GRMC, where the founder Pierre Schaeffer and Pierre Henry pioneered the tape-editing techniques of musique concr\u00e8te. Unlike its Paris counterpart, the workshop began with a minuscule budget and meagre equipment. \"It was mainly secondhand - stuff the BBC had thrown out, peculiar devices that were useless until the workshop's original engineer, Richard 'Dickie' Bird, managed to get them working again,\" says Hodgson. Although the project was Oram's brainchild, she soon left. Concerned that working with experimental sound could result in brain disturbances or madness, the powers that be decreed people could work there for only three months. The rules were soon changed, but too late for Oram, who resigned from the BBC and built an independent studio to pursue her dream of a system that could enable the composer to \"draw\" sound.</p> <p>The BBC's music department was suspicious, verging on hostile, about the workshop's creation. The push came from the drama department. The workshop \"was much more part of the 50s theatre revolution than the music revolution\", according to Hodgson, who had trained as an actor before joining the BBC. The term \"workshop\" came from theatre, he says. \"It was a trendy term in the late 50s, but if the unit had been started a decade later, during the era of arts labs, it'd probably have been called the Radiophonic Laboratory.\" </p> <p>Through the 50s and into the 60s, the drama department encouraged new writers and formal experiments of all kinds. Producers started to mess around with the newly available reel-to-reel tape machines that were replacing the 78rpm platters on to which studio managers had recorded sound effects. \"If you accidentally left the fader open on a tape machine, you'd get this dreadful howl-round sound,\" recalls the chief engineer Dick Mills. \"But if you could control it, you got peculiar echo effects that created a kind of disembodied voice, which could be used to portray a character in a radio drama thinking aloud, or undergoing mental distress.\" In an increasingly chaotic environment of studio managers borrowing tape machines and forgetting to return them, the decision was made to create a unit dedicated to providing incidental music and sounds for anybody within the BBC who required them. </p> <p>One of the gems on The John Baker Tapes, released in July, is Baker's appearance on an early 60s edition of Woman's Hour to explain how he made a whimsically futuristic jingle for the show's \"reading your letters\" segment. A single glug from water poured out of a cider bottle supplied the timbre for the main melody, the dry pop of a cork being pulled out of another bottle served as percussion. Altering the speed of the tape varied the pitch and created a couple of octaves of notes; each individual note was then sliced and spliced into a sequence. Hours and hours of intricate work resulted in a jingle arresting enough to get readers writing in about the tune.</p> <p>On the continent, state-run stations such as Radiodiffusion-T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Fran\u00e7aise, Westdeutscher Rundfunk and Radio Italia funded their own sound laboratories dedicated to exploring the new tape-editing techniques and grappling with primitive devices, such as ring oscillators, for generating pure electronic sound. But whereas Bernard Parmegiani in Paris or Karlheinz Stockhausen in Cologne were allowed to engage in pure research, the workshop's activities were always tethered to the practical. The team had to earn their keep with futuristic jingles and wacky noises. \"We weren't composers flying our own kites,\" Mills says. \"Any experimenting we did was always within the context of someone's programme.\" It was craft, not art, with an aura redolent of an amateur cobbling together Heath Robinson-like contraptions in the garden shed. \"Because we're not experts,\" the workshop's indulgent manager, Desmond Briscoe, would say, \"we don't know what we shouldn't be able to do.\"</p> <p>Alongside its bodged quality, early Radiophonic output was often suffused with English surrealist humour. There was a comedy connection: The Goon Show was one of the workshop's early clients, with Mills creating such well-known effects as \"Major Bloodnok's Stomach\", an absurdist eruption of gastric turbulence that signalled the entrance of \"an Indian officer gentleman with a passion for hot curries and loose women\". According to the workshop composer Paddy Kingsland, \"Spike Milligan virtually wanted to take the place over; Desmond Briscoe talked of having to fight him off.\"</p> <p>Another difference between Radiophonic and its peers in Europe was the prominent role of women, from the co-founder Oram, through early composers such as Derbyshire and Maddalena Fagandini, to later figures Glynis Jones and Elizabeth Parker. Derbyshire had first sought employment at Decca Records, only to be rebuffed with \"we don't have women in engineering or technical roles\". By contrast, the BBC had a remarkably progressive policy in terms of equal employment opportunities. This went back at least as far as the second world war when, Hodgson says, \"the BBC was virtually run by women, because the men were off fighting\".</p> <p>Derbyshire is easily the most famous alumna. Her striking looks (\"tall, with beautiful auburn hair\", recalls Hodgson) and erratic life (heavy drinking, bouts of depression, eccentricity) contribute to the mystique. Mostly, though, it's about the remarkable music. A gifted mathematician, she plotted out her pieces with a scientist's precision. \"Blue Veils and Golden Sands\", music for a documentary about the Tuaregs of the Sahara and her most celebrated piece after the Doctor Who theme (written by Ron Grainer, but transformed by Derbyshire's electronic realisation), involved analysing a real-world sound source into \"all of its partials and frequencies\", then reconstructing it using the workshop's battery of oscillators. The original sound was almost comically prosaic: a standard-issue \"tatty green BBC lampshade\", she recalled in one interview, which gave off an ethereal bell-like sound when struck. </p> <p>The piece also involved Derbyshire's treated and chopped-up voice and \"slowed-down camel groans that were looped and filtered\", says the workshop archivist Mark Ayres, who has compiled the forthcoming CD set. Ayres has been slowly cataloguing and digitising the 4,000 reels (which contain approximately 3,000 hours) in the workshop's chaotic library, which once occupied three rooms but was shunted into a single room in Maida Vale during the unit's twilight years. Only a diehard fan would take on this labour of love, which involves painstakingly restoring tapes that have dried up or gone sticky because of myriad edits. </p> <p>Thanks to Doctor Who's popularity from the early 60s onwards, intrigued pop musicians began to pay visits to Maida Vale, including Pink Floyd, Jimi Hendrix and Rolling Stone Brian Jones. Paul McCartney approached Derbyshire with a view to her providing electronic backing for \"Yesterday\". It never happened, but later she did the music for one of Yoko Ono's experimental movies, Wrapping Piece. By this time the prim-voiced and \"impeccably dressed\" Derbyshire of the early Radiophonic days had thrown herself into the swinging 60s, adopting what Hodgson fondly calls her \"gypsy grandmother mode\" of clothing and going through, according to Mills, a period of \"funny-coloured tobacco, and snuff, and cider\". She and Hodgson formed an electronic research-and-performance entity called Unit Delta Plus, in collaboration with the inventor Peter Zinovieff, who set up a studio that was far better equipped than the workshop. After working all day at the BBC, they'd head down to Putney to work all evening there.</p> <p>The neophiliac mania that had buoyed the 60s was crashing hard by 1970, and the Radiophonic Workshop wasn't immune. The new synthesisers superseded tape-editing, and the balance shifted from \"soundsmiths\" (including Hodgson and Mills) to \"tunesmiths\" - new recruits such as Kingsland, who had played in rock bands. Television's hours and channels were expanding: Kingsland did the music and weird noises for the chilling children's series The Changes, set in a Luddite near-future when people turn against technology, and later scored both the radio and TV versions of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.</p> <p>In the 80s, the Radiophonic Workshop embraced the new digital technology of sequencers, samplers and MIDI (the machine that enables musicians to synch up all kinds of electronic devices). When Hodgson returned to take over from Briscoe as manager, his first priority was to modernise and re-equip. In addition to the huge demand from television, the workshop was initiating large-scale productions of its own, such as Peter Howell's Inferno Revisited, a reinterpretation of Dante. </p> <p>Yet while the 80s were in many ways triumphant years for the workshop, the music that Radiophonic cultists cherish tends to be from the early, makeshift days, when magical results were achieved by the most rudimentary means: tape, razor blades, found sounds. By the mid-80s, electronic music gear could be found in any Dixons. The function and future of the workshop had become cloudy. \"In a way, our success created the seeds of our destruction,\" says Hodgson. \"We'd got people used to electronic music and we'd pushed the technology that made the do-it-yourself thing possible. Nowadays a kid in his bedroom has more technological resources than we had for the first 25 years of the workshop. It's the democratisation of music.\"</p> <p>In the 90s, John Birt introduced reforms of the BBC designed to create a kind of internal market. For the workshop, \"producer choice\" - the slogan of the day - meant \"the big programmes could hire anybody they liked from outside\", Hodgson explains. \"As a result, the workshop sort of collapsed.\"</p> <p>Hodgson emphasises the workshop's radio and TV output for schools. He remembers a programme that taught geography by using the idea of a magic carpet whizzing across the globe. \"If you're a kid,\" he says, it can only be good for your imagination to hear the sound of a magic carpet taking off. </p> <p>The workshop fitted the Reithian concept of what a national broadcaster should be about: expanding the cultural horizons of the general public. Among the many contemporary outfits influenced by it is the London-based Ghost Box label. Julian House, the label's co-founder, aligns the workshop with the postwar spirit of planning and building for a better future that encompassed modernist architecture and urban planning, the Open University, and Penguin and Pelican paperbacks. \"It's now unthinkable,\" he says, \"that a public body could produce for the masses such avant-garde, forward-thinking, sometimes difficult music.\"</p> <p>\u00b7 This article was amended on Wednesday October 15 2008.

  "<p>\"The author of that taut masterpiece, Brokeback Mountain, has produced some disappointingly broken-backed novels,\" said <strong>Peter Kemp</strong> in the Sunday Times, reviewing Annie Proulx's Fine Just the Way It Is. \"In the short story, a form that demands selectivity and spareness, she comes into her own.\" \"These are meticulous, wonderfully actualised descriptions of small lives lived in a place that is lonely and unchanging, and heartbreakingly beautiful, and that is trying to kill you,\" wrote <strong>Sam Leith</strong> in the Daily Telegraph. \"In Proulx's Wyoming, your past is never over, and you are very unlikely to die anywhere so peaceful as a bed,\" observed <strong>Archie Bland</strong> in the Independent. \"This is relentless, barren and possibly malevolent country, and the real achievement of Fine Just The Way It Is is to transmit characters' strong sense of the conspiracy of their environment.\" Or, as<strong> Tim Adams</strong> put it in the Observer: \"This is the territory Proulx stakes out for herself. Who needs hell when you have Wyoming?\"</p> <p>\"What novelists call territory is one of the defining elements of fiction,\" said <strong>Russell Celyn Jones</strong> in the Financial Times. \"It is often so sacred to the writer, and so hard won, that it becomes a constant in their work . . . But it cannot be said of Andrew Miller. Each of his five novels embraces quite different territories. His latest, One Morning Like a Bird, is a rather exquisite Japanese imitation . . . yet the risk for such an audacious chameleon lies in the comparison he may face with the real deal: to writers who own their territory ethnically.\" \"The frank simplicity of Miller's prose, and his search for truth in the reality of the quotidian feels (to this western reader) convincingly Japanese,\" wrote <strong>Helen Brown</strong> in the Daily Telegraph. \"Miller places his words and plot developments carefully, like the smooth grey pebbles of a Zen garden.\" \"There are moments of delicate prose that clearly reach for the painterly effect of a Japanese screen,\" said <strong>Harriet Paterson</strong> in the Sunday Telegraph, \"but they are too sporadic to create an overall texture.\" \"The prose has been reduced in favour of a quieter, more brittle voice,\" wrote <strong>Natalie Sandison</strong> in the Times, \"that fits its aesthetic and works as an intellectual project but lacks the irresistible pull and flow of his previous novels.\" </p> <p>\"AN Wilson thinks the second Elizabethan age is when the United Kingdom lost its mojo,\" said <strong>Sam Leith</strong> (again) in the Spectator, reviewing Our Times. \"We gained material comfort but lost our identity as a nation . . . The established institutions of church and crown crumbled about us, the empire vanished and the skids went under the Union. Mass immigration brought a dissolving cultural pluralism. There is no longer, as Wilson sees it, a 'Britain' about which you can meaningfully say anything much at all.\" \"There is far too much bile in Our Times,\" wrote <strong>Roy Hattersley</strong> in the Times. \"But despite that blemish - cynical readers may say because of it - the story is told with a verve that catches the excitement of a turbulent era.\" \"The book often descends into fogeyish diatribe,\" said <strong>Piers Brendon</strong> in the Sunday Times, \"as if it were striving to become an extended think-piece for the Evening Standard. Moreover, written in far too much of a hurry, it is unpolished, repetitious, incoherent and woefully inaccurate.\"</p>",
  "<h2>Is gold still a safe haven and will the price now soar?</h2> <p>In just four hours after the US government bailed out AIG, the gold price jumped $60 an ounce - a rise of 12% - as jittery investors pulled their money out of risky equities and piled into the traditional safe haven. Some commentators are now predicting it will soon recover to the $1,000 an ounce peak it hit in March, and then go even higher.</p> <p>But memories of the last great boom still haunt the market. In 1980, gold hit $850, but what followed was a painful two-decade-long bear market. Not until 2001 did the price bottom out, at $250. Sadly, that was also when Gordon Brown was selling off Britain's gold reserves, achieving an average price of only $275 an ounce.</p> <p>Anybody who bought in March this year is also suffering hefty losses, with the bullion price 25% off its peak and the share price of gold mining companies down even further. Adrian Ash of BullionVault says: \"With US bonds yielding virtually zero, gold is looking very attractive.</p> <p>\"In general, it does well during periods of negative real interest rates, such as in the 70s, and a lot of people say we're heading that way again.\"</p> <p>There are various ways to buy gold:<br><strong>\u00b7</strong> Funds: money goes into gold mining companies.<br><strong>\u00b7</strong> ETFs: Exchange Traded Funds.<br><strong>\u00b7</strong> Coins: a full sovereign was selling for \u00a3112-\u00a3114 this week.</p> <p>Think that you might cash in on the soaring gold price by selling your old gold ring or watch? Plenty of scrap merchants (try Hatton Garden in London) will pay around pounds \u00a34 a gram. They'll even buy your old gold tooth. But don't go pulling it out - that old tooth of yours will probably fetch little more than a fiver.</p> <h2>Who gets the prize for \"I told you so\"?</h2> <p>In May 2007, when the property market was still fizzing and the stock market flourishing, Britain's leading \"star\" investment manager, Anthony Bolton of Fidelity, sold nearly all his bank and financial stocks, stating publicly that banks were risking defaults on a scale not seen for decades. He said a major correction in markets was inevitable, and criticised banks for stumping up billions in cheap credit for deals where the risks were not being priced in.</p> <p>Perhaps the most stoically pessimistic voice has been David Kauders, who runs a small financial advice business in Reading. He has been telling his investors for years that Britain's debt-fuelled prosperity is a mirage, that shares are wildly over-valued and the only safe home for your cash is government bonds.</p> <h2>Should I sell my shares?</h2> <p>Tough one. This week the FTSE fell below the 5,000 level for the first time since June 2005. Few people are willing to call the bottom of the market while banks are creaking so badly. </p> <p>The FTSE dropped to 3,500 after the dotcom crash, and commentators are unanimous in calling this a far worse crisis. One positive sign is that the yield (the annual dividend income) on leading shares is now higher than the yield on government bonds. That's a rare occurrence (usually during times of maximum market distress) and is often the sign of an impending recovery. But don't bet the house on it. </p> <p>At Societe Generale, strategist Albert Edwards says we're in an \"ice age\" in which equities could fall another 60%. \"We continue to find a growing number of people who agree that the current situation looks increasingly similar to Japan's post-bubble disaster. Actually, it's much worse,\" he says. Kauders says prepare yourself for dramatic interest rate falls, and predict gilts at 1% within five years.</p> <h2>Are collectables a better bet than shares?</h2> <p>\"Banks fall over, art triumphs,\" Sir Norman Rosenthal, former exhibitions secretary of the Royal Academy, said this week after Damien Hirst's two-day auction at Sotheby's took off like a rocket. The hot money seems to be pouring out of hedge funds and into pickled unicorns and winged pigs.</p> <p>Chateau Margaux is not far behind. Fine wines have risen in price by 9.5% so far this year, according to the Liv-ex 100 Fine Wine Index. </p> <p>But if City bonuses plunge, the fall-out on collectables is likely to be severe. </p> <h2>I have \u00a37,000 in a shares ISA. Is it at risk?</h2> <p>Yes. The average UK equity income is down 19% over the past year, and the biggest fund used by small investors, Invesco Perpetual Income, is down 14%, so many people have already taken a hit. Unit trusts and investment trusts are not at risk of total collapse in the style of Lehman Brothers. Even if they are run by a financial institution which collapses, assets are always carefully ring-fenced and held in custody.</p> <h2>I want safety, not risk. Where do I invest?</h2> <p>Corporate bond funds are not totally safe - most have lost a couple of percent in value over the past year - but are a decent safe haven. Top performing funds include those from M&amp;G, Standard Life, Fidelity and Prudential. When interest rates fall, as they are predicted to do, they tend to perform relatively well. Another option is mix bonds and equities into a single fund. Big players include Invesco Perpetual's Distribution fund, Axa Global Distribution, Threadneedle Equity and Bond Defensive and JP Morgan's Cautious Total Return fund. </p> <h2>Are the things that blew up Lehman's and AIG sitting in my investment fund?</h2> <p>Highly unlikely. Most unit trusts and investment trusts are \"plain vanilla\" funds which don't use derivatives. But in recent years a few have begun to use hedge-fund style strategies which may expose them to greater risk. keep a close eye on \"exchange traded funds\". </p> <p>These have become a popular and cheap route for investors wanting to track not just share prices, but also commodities, especially gold. </p> <h2>If a unit trust goes under, what compensation do I get?</h2> <p>Investment funds are covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, and payouts are more generous than for deposits at banks. The maximum is \u00a348,000 per person, made up of 100% of the first \u00a330,000 and 90% of the next \u00a320,000. Offshore investments are covered if you received advice from an firm authorised by the FSA. Firms outside the European Economic Area are unlikely to be covered.</p> <h2>I rely upon share dividends. Will they be paid this year?</h2> <p>Mostly yes, but in some cases no. A Merrill Lynch survey this week found that fund managers think that forecasts on corporate profits are hopelessly optimistic.</p> <p>Dividends from the banks will be shot to pieces, but there's plenty of \"safe haven\" sectors such as food, supermarkets, telecoms, oils and pharmaceuticals where profits are relatively immune from the credit crunch.</p> <h2>I bought a 'guaranteed' investment bond. How safe is the guarantee?</h2> <p>Only as good as the party issuing the guarantee. Given the near-collapse of a giant insurer such as AIG, the quality of these guarantees may be limited. Another risk is that guaranteed products frequently use derivatives to secure their return, and these may not turn out to be as safe as once promised.</p> <h2>I bought a property fund two years ago, which is doing badly. Is it time to bail out?</h2> <p>It's not looking good. Merrill Lynch says real estate is the sector currently most disliked by fund managers. Most of the money in property funds is invested in office blocks in the City and elsewhere, which are severely exposed to the fallout from the financial sector. After property, the next most hated sectors in the UK are technology, banks and retail. Globally, investors are also pulling away from emerging markets, commodities and Europe, where the risks of recession are now rising fast.</p> <h2>Will sterling fall further?</h2> <p>Again, the prognosis isn't good. Financial services make up a large part of Britain's economy, the housing market is tumbling, and households are massively indebted. They are all good reasons for selling sterling. But the other major currencies are little better; many commentators are saying that the euro is heading for a fall, while the dollar has already risen against sterling and may not have much further to gain.</p>",
  "<h2>Lehmans goes bust, AIG is nationalised, HBOS is rescued - it's been an extraordinary week, and there could be more to come. So, amid the turmoil, what's 100% safe?</h2> <p>It's not sexy, it's not racy, but if you're looking for an absolutely copper-bottomed guarantee that your money will be safe, no matter what, then make a beeline for National Savings &amp; Investments. NS&amp;I is the government's savings bank, backed by the Treasury, and unless you have access to the vault at the Bank of England, it's probably the safest place to keep your money in Britain. And if you don't believe us, take it from Stephen Hawking and the other heavyweight celebs that NS&amp;I has recruited for its new TV ad. After all, Hawking knows a thing or two about black holes.</p> <p>The front page of the NS&amp;I website carries the headline \"100% security for your money\", and in these times of trouble, it seems that anxious savers are taking it at its word. Money has been piling in to National Savings ever since the Northern Rock debacle; last month it announced it had enjoyed its strongest ever annual sales performance.</p> <p>The price of safety is high. You can usually get better rates elsewhere - and NS&amp;I this week slashed rates on some of its most popular products, including fixed-interest savings certificates, children's bonus bonds and guaranteed-income bonds. But in the current environment, some worried savers won't care that the rates aren't the best you can get.</p> <p>Is your money really absolutely safe? \"There is no way you could lose your money,\" a spokeswoman assured us.</p> <p>In terms of what's on offer, its Easy Access Savings Account has been popular among those looking for a no-hassle, no-frills home for their cash, even though its rates of interest are less than impressive. It is an instant-access account which comes with a cash card that lets you pay in money at post office branches and make withdrawals from ATMs. It can be opened with \u00a3100 or more, and has tiered interest rates, paying between 1.85% gross interest (for deposits of between \u00a3100 and \u00a3999) and 4.4% (\u00a350,000-plus).</p> <p>Those looking for a better rate of interest might want to consider the NS&amp;I Direct Isa, paying a tax-free 5.3%. The minimum opening deposit is \u00a31,000, and it is aimed at those happy to manage their account by phone and online.</p> <p>If you're a higher-rate taxpayer and/or you're worried that inflation will hang around for a while, it's worth taking a gander at National Savings' index-linked savings certificates. As inflation has surged, so has the attractiveness of these lump-sum savings products. With index-linked savings certificates, the value of your investment increases in line with inflation (as measured by the Retail Prices Index) and earns guaranteed interest on top - with all your returns tax-free. These three- and five-year savings products currently give higher-rate taxpayers a savings rate equivalent to around 9.5%.</p> <p>To get the best return you have to stay in for the full term, although you can get out after one year and still benefit from index-linking and extra interest. You can invest between \u00a3100 and \u00a315,000 per issue.</p> <p>The bad news is that rates on some of NS&amp;I's fixed-rate investments were this week hacked by up to 0.75%. It means the latest issue of children's bonus bonds now pay 3.7%. Those on sale little more than a year ago were paying 5.1%. Nevertheless, if you want to save for a child, and do not want to take risks, these are well worth considering. They are five-year fixed rate products that can be bought by anyone over 16 for a child under 16. You can deposit between \u00a325 and \u00a33,000 in each issue, and all returns are tax-free for both child and parent.</p> <p>The rates on the two- and five-year fixed-interest savings certificates, which offer a guaranteed tax-free return, have fallen to just 2.95%.</p> <p>You would have thought that NS&amp;I would have been quick to crow about how much lovely money it has been pulling in lately. Last year, at the height of the Northern Rock crisis, it was happy to give out this information, but now it appears the government has gagged its savings bank. \"We do have a new policy at NS&amp;I that we will not issue sales figures outside of our quarterly reporting in order not to rock the financial markets,\" says the spokeswoman, who adds that it is too early to say if the current instability has affected sales.</p> <p>Talking of Northern Rock, thanks to the government's intervention, the Newcastle-based institution is also able to offer its customers a guarantee that any money in its accounts - whether it's \u00a31 or \u00a31m - is 100% secure. However, this is not an open-ended commitment; if and when Northern Rock returns to the private sector, it is likely to be put on to a similar footing as other banks and building societies.</p> <h2>Are my savings safe?</h2> <p>Lloyds TSB's rescue of Halifax's parent company HBOS - a deal reportedly brokered by the prime minister - suggests there is an implicit state guarantee of the major high street banks, and all the money people have saved with them. In other words, HBOS, HSBC, Barclays and the like are simply too large, and too crucial to the economy, to be allowed to fail. If you follow that logic, big is definitely best.</p> <h2>Shouldn't I just put it all under the mattress?</h2> <p>Don't go there. If your cash is nicked, home insurance policies typically pay out somewhere between \u00a3500 and \u00a31,000 for stolen money.</p> <h2>So what should savers do?</h2> <p>Don't put all your eggs in one basket. If you've got a fair bit of cash, spread your savings around a number of different institutions. Check who owns the bank or runs its savings operation. That's because people could be left out of pocket if they have their money in two or more savings providers that happen to be part of the same banking group, which then collapses.</p> <p>If you've got less than \u00a335,000 in an account, you can relax: you will get all your money back. If you have more tied up in one institution, now may be the time to think about finding another home for some of it.</p> <h2>Which bank will be the next to get into trouble?</h2> <p>That's one of the $64,000 dollar questions! Who, a few weeks ago, would have thought that the mighty HBOS - the Tesco of the banking world - would have to be rescued? Royal Bank of Scotland's share price has certainly had a torrid time of it, falling by 10% on Tuesday, 10% the next day and 4.5% on Thursday. The Guardian's Nils Pratley wrote on Thursday that RBS \"shares some of HBOS's financial characteristics. The size of RBS's loan book exceeds the size of its deposit base - not to the same degree, but the number is still large\". But he added that RBS is a bigger, more diversified bank.</p> <h2>What happens if my bank or building society goes bust, and will I lose all my money?</h2> <p>There is an official rescue fund called the Financial Services Compensation Scheme that protects savers if their bank or building society goes under. Payouts are \"per person per bank\", and were made more generous following the Northern Rock debacle. If your savings provider goes belly-up, you will now receive the first \u00a335,000 of your savings money back, and there are proposals to raise this to \u00a350,000. The \u00a335,000 limit applies to the total amount held with an organisation, regardless of how many accounts someone has, or whether they are a single or joint account holder.</p> <h2>I have all my savings at Halifax. Are they safe?</h2> <p>Probably more so than they were earlier this week. The merger is designed to shore up HBOS and protect the millions of savers who hold a total of \u00a3243bn in their accounts. Even if the new combined bank should fail, savers would be protected under the compensation scheme.</p> <p>Prudence suggests that you do not hold more than \u00a335,000 at any one institution. But prudence might also suggest that you think carefully before moving the cash to smaller banks offering better rates. Not all of them will be able to clamber into the lifeboat.</p> <h2>I have accounts at both Halifax and Lloyds TSB. What should I do?</h2> <p>Until the deal is done and dusted, which could take months, the two banks will continue to be treated as separate institutions, so customers will get protection for the first \u00a335,000 they hold in each. It will be interesting to see what happens when the merger is complete. In the case of Royal Bank of Scotland, which took over NatWest a few years back, most of its banking brands are separately authorised by the Financial Services Authority. So someone with money in RBS, NatWest, Tesco Personal Finance (which is 50%-owned by RBS) and Coutts would get a separate helping of protection for each of these.</p> <p>Other banks have done things differently. For example, the HBOS group includes Halifax, the Bank of Scotland, Birmingham Midshires and Intelligent Finance. Birmingham Midshires also provides savings accounts for Saga and the AA. At the moment, all six of these brands operate under a single FSA authorisation, which means that if someone had \u00a335,000 in a Halifax account, and the same amount in accounts with Birmingham Midshires, the AA and Saga, and HBOS went bust tomorrow, instead of getting \u00a3140,000 compensation, they would only get \u00a335,000.</p> <h2>It all sounds horribly complicated ...</h2> <p>It is. MPs on the Commons Treasury select committee this week said it is unreasonable to expect customers to know whether their savings provider has an individual or a shared banking licence. They have urged the FSA to look into requiring each banking brand to have its own authorisation.</p> <h2>What'll happen to Howard Brown, the singing star of those annoying Halifax ads?</h2> <p>On Thursday, the Sun stuck Brown on its front page and said it was unclear whether he would be keeping his job. The paper rigged up an image of him riding a Lloyds TSB black horse, which might give the ad men some ideas. Only last month, the Star reported that he had been axed from the ads \"because he is too cheery for the credit crunch\".</p> <h2>My wife and I have a joint account. What happens to us?</h2> <p>The good news for people with joint accounts is that they effectively enjoy twice the normal level of protection. The compensation scheme will assume the money is split equally between the two account holders, so each person would be eligible for the full \u00a335,000 compensation. In other words, up to \u00a370,000 would be covered.</p> <h2>Doesn't all this prove I should put all my savings in a building society?</h2> <p>Once viewed as boring, building societies such as the Nationwide have come into their own lately, with many savers seeing them as a safe haven in times of trouble. They are immune from speculative attacks by hedge funds because they are not quoted on the stockmarket. And the sector is proud of the fact that no member of a building society has lost any of their investment since at least 1945. Also, building societies tend to help their own, with one usually stepping in if another gets into trouble.</p> <h2>I thought some building societies were putting money into all sorts of dodgy things?</h2> <p>The sector's reputation as safe and unsexy took a blow this month when it emerged that more than a quarter of Derbyshire Building Society's balance sheet was made up of adverse credit and sub-prime loans. Nationwide has seen its lending volume drop by 40% and booked losses of more than \u00a3100m on six structured investment vehicles, while more than a quarter of lending by Britannia, the second-biggest society, is in areas such as buy-to-let, credit impaired and \"self-cert\" loans.</p> <h2>What if my money is in the UK arm of an overseas bank?</h2> <p>If it is the UK division of a non-European bank, for example ICICI Bank UK, which is owned by one of India's largest financial institutions, the protection is exactly the same as that applying to British-owned banks.</p> <h2>What if the parent company is based in Europe?</h2> <p>It's slightly more complicated. EU rules mean all countries in the European Economic Area must have a compensation scheme in place, but in most cases these schemes are less generous than the UK's (France and Italy are the exceptions). However, European banks have the option of joining our scheme to \"top up\" the level of protection offered, and most reputable European banks with a UK presence have done just that. This means you would end up being entitled to the same amount, but the compensation would be provided by two schemes.</p> <h2>Which European banks have topped up?</h2> <p>They include ING Direct and Triodos Bank (both with parent companies in the Netherlands), Bank of Ireland (which provides many of the Post Office's savings accounts) and Landsbanki. For a list, log on to <a href=\"http://www.fscs.org.uk/consumer/How_to_Claim/Deposits/EEA_firms_that_have_topped_up\">fscs.org.uk</a>.</p> <h2>How's Barclays faring?</h2> <p>Barclays bounced back this week by snapping up some of Lehman Brothers' prime US assets for what many said was a bargain price. But analysts are still concerned about its wholesale funding gap which though less than half the level of RBS or HBOS, is still huge. </p> <h2>What about HSBC?</h2> <p>HSBC has made huge losses because of the US sub-prime mortgage crisis, but its shares have outperformed its rivals. This week it became the world's biggest bank by market value - though how long it will retain that title ...</p> <h2>Abbey?</h2> <p>Abbey is probably fortunate that it was taken over by Spanish banking giant Santander, which is also in the process of swallowing up Alliance &amp; Leicester. Santander is regarded as one of Europe's strongest banks, partly because it has little or no exposure to the US sub-prime mortgage market. But problems in the Spanish property market could drag it down. </p> <h2>How about Bradford &amp; Bingley?</h2> <p>The former building society and leading buy-to-let lender has endured a savage few months. Its share price was just 25p on Thursday; in April they were worth more than \u00a32. A few days ago, Moody's, the ratings agency, slashed its credit rating. If things carry on like this, Mr Bradford and Mr Bingley will soon be found sitting in a shop doorway, asking passers-by to throw a few coppers into their bowler hats.</p> <h2>I'm an HBOS shareholder. How much will I get?</h2> <p>There are nearly two million Brits who hold shares in HBOS, which tumbled from \u00a310 this time last year to 88p in frantic trading before the rescue by Lloyds TSB. Assuming the deal goes ahead, HBOS shareholders will see each share exchanged for 0.83 shares in Lloyds TSB instead. At the time the deal was announced, that worked out as 232p per HBOS share. But the next day, the Lloyds TSB share price dropped to around 230p, so that meant HBOS holders would receive shares worth 190.9p. The next few months will be tortuous as the deal has to be approved. It's entirely possible that in the meantime speculators will drive down Lloyds TSB's share price.</p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown today seeks to mount a political fightback, claiming that a display of decisive leadership from his government has helped to see the British economy through one of the most tumultuous weeks in financial history.</p> <p>His claim, on the eve of Labour's critical party conference in Manchester, followed a remarkable day on the financial markets which saw shares on both sides of the Atlantic soar, after emergency government intervention raised hopes that the worst of the crisis may be over. The FTSE 100 saw its biggest ever one-day rise, up 8.8% as it closed 431 points higher, adding \u00a3103bn to the stock market. </p> <p>Despite the rally, the FTSE 100 had failed to make up the week's losses. It was still 105 points below the level at which it started a week that has changed the landscape of the global markets and witnessed the creation of a banking behemoth through the emergency takeover of HBOS by Lloyds TSB.</p> <p>On Wall Street, shares extended Thursday's late rally, the biggest in six years, after the Bush administration unveiled a plan to buy up the toxic mortgages at the heart of the current credit crisis, at a cost of \"hundreds of billions\" of dollars to the US taxpayer. George Bush admitted the plan would put a \"significant amount of taxpayers' money on the line\". </p> <p>And the treasury secretary, Henry Paulson, issued a stark assessment of the problems: \"As we all know, lax lending practices earlier this decade led to irresponsible lending and irresponsible borrowing. This put too many families into mortgages they could not afford.\"</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/20/economy.labour\">an article for the Guardian today</a>, Brown says that Labour has had to rescue the financial system in the face of Conservative opposition, remarks that will infuriate David Cameron but delight depressed Labour delegates as thousands gather for the party conference today.</p> <p>As a fresh round of opinion polls show that he is failing to overturn the Tories' poll lead, the prime minister points to his action in the markets, writing: \"Just as when we stopped Northern Rock going to the wall, we took the necessary and decisive action this week to protect stability and keep the financial system moving.\"</p> <p>He also reveals he would have liked to have secured a consensus on the FSA's decision to ban short-selling of stocks, but he claims \"the Conservatives had offered only partisan criticism\". </p> <p>Ed Balls, the children's secretary and Brown's closest ally, also launches an eve-of-conference offensive today against the rebels who have called for Brown to be toppled, dismissing their call for a leadership election as \"an outbreak of 'Mrs Merton' politics\" which would cost Labour the next election if it continued. In a reprise of Caroline Aherne's famous line, Balls tells the Guardian the rebels are saying: \"Let us have a heated debate, for the sake of it.\"</p> <p>Balls adds: \"Most people in the Labour party would have thought they have taken leave of their senses. They are doing David Cameron's job for him. Every single one of us has got to raise our game. But the one thing that will definitely finish us is to divide in public.\" </p> <p>Last night the chancellor, Alistair Darling, gave the first indication of the impact of the gridlock in the financial markets on British banks. He made it clear the Bank of England was making \u00a3100bn available to banks in its emerging lending scheme - more than double the first estimate of \u00a340bn when it was launched in April.</p> <p>The Tories have claimed that the financial crisis has shown that a dangerous credit bubble was allowed to form over the past 10 years under a regulatory structure created by Brown. But Balls, Brown's former chief economic adviser to the Treasury, denies the Tory charge. </p> <p>He told the Guardian: \"Fundamentally we believe regulation is necessary to make the economy work, and the Tories have opposed regulation at every turn. This is about differing views of the role of the state. This will define the next 12 months so the debate will not be about outcomes, but fundamentally different ways in which you manage the economy and public services.\"</p> <p>Balls also discloses plans for a new effort to win back the hearts and minds of public sector workers to persuade them to support Labour at the next election. His plan, to be outlined at the Labour conference in Manchester next Wednesday, will offer a new deal for 2.8 million education workers by promising to raise the pay of super headteachers, legally enforce a cutback in teachers' workloads, and improve the career path of teaching assistants.</p>",
  "<p>Sir Alex Ferguson could not resist taking a sly swipe at Chelsea as Manchester United prepared for their first visit to Stamford Bridge since Patrice Evra was caught up in a brawl with a groundsman who had taken exception to the players \"warming down\" while he was mowing the grass. </p> <p>\"It will be interesting to see what they have on the pitch on Sunday,\" Ferguson mused. \"Maybe they'll have a combine harvester waiting for us this time.\"</p> <p>Evra is due to appear before an FA inquiry on October 2 and Ferguson insisted the defender had a \"fair case\" to be acquitted, the allegation from United being that he was provoked by racial insults, which Chelsea deny. The incident has damaged the already fraught relationship between the two clubs and Ferguson, who rarely misses an opportunity to undermine United's opponents, insisted the clashes with Chelsea never meant as much as when his team were playing Arsenal.</p> <p>\"If you look back over the last 12 or 13 years, who has it been? Arsenal v Manchester United, Manchester United v Arsenal. Of course we've got Chelsea at the moment, but the history of Arsenal and Manchester United means that you're not just talking about winning a football match, you're talking about your history against the other team's history.\"</p> <p>Chelsea, according to Ferguson, are merely \"beginning a history\" although, that said, he regards them as United's most authentic challengers and has noted a difference in their style of play since Luiz Felipe Scolari's appointment, particularly now that Michael Essien has suffered a long-term injury.</p> <p>\"The difference is Deco, who's a different type of midfield player to what they have had in the past. They've always relied on the power and athleticism of Essien. [Claude] Makelele was a very important cog in their machine too. But now they have a different type of player - a diminutive, clever, nice footballer, and that has made a difference to the way they play.\"</p> <p>United have not scored more than one goal in any match this season and a defeat would leave them nine points behind Chelsea, albeit with a game in hand. \"We don't want to be trailing,\" Ferguson continued. \"We don't want to be nine points behind Chelsea. We don't want to be nine points behind anyone. So obviously we've got a job to do.</p> <p>\"All I'm looking for is my team to start putting the ball into the net. We're not scoring enough goals. If we could do that, it would turn the whole thing around. But it will come. By October we will be fine, there's no question about that.\"</p>",
  "<h2>Do we need more royal portraits?</h2> <p>The portrait of Princes Margaret by Pietro Annigoni that has just gone on view at the National Portrait Gallery will have at least one fan: my mum. She is also called Margaret, was young in the 1950s when this dates from, and looks like the Queen's pretty sister.</p> <p>I'm sure she and many other people will enjoy seeing this lavish homage, painted two years after Princess Margaret renounced her plans to marry Group Captain Peter Townsend, and giving her the pose of a classical beauty painted by Parmigianino or Ingres.</p> <p>And that's what portraits are about, according to the National Portrait Gallery. Everyone has heroes, or simply celebrities they are interested in - and for a large number of people, in Britain and abroad, members of the royal family come into that category. Sadly, this does not make Annigoni's portrait into a good work of art. There are almost no good works of art in the National Portrait Gallery, anyway - and this isn't going to change that with its pretentious, sentimental and somehow rather creepy simulacrum of the Old Masters. If only the Chapman brothers could get their hands on it. The fact that 2,000 people a day queued to see it at Agnew's Gallery in 1957 just shows you what Francis Bacon and Lucian Freud were up against trying to be great artists in post-war Britain.</p> <p>Annigoni's painting is a reminder of how dismal modern royal portraiture has been. Does this reflect sheer bad taste on the part of the Windsors? Previous British monarchs were portrayed by some great artists: such as Holbein and the anonymous medieval European painter whose wonderful Wilton Diptych shows Richard II saying his prayers. Since the second world war there has only been one commissioned portrait of a British royal that is a masterpiece and that is Freud's brutally realistic portrait of the Queen, isolated and unhappy. Freud proved it is perfectly possible for modern royal portraits to be great art. But course, 99% of royalists would prefer to look at the Annigoni. </p> <p><strong>Jonathan Jones </strong></p> <h2>Do spies make good leaders?</h2> <p>Tzipi Livni, a former agent in Israel's secret foreign service, Mossad, was this week elected the new leader of the country's ruling Kadima party. If she can form a coalition cabinet within six weeks she will become the country's next prime minister, only the second woman to hold the office since the creation of the Israel.</p> <p>What did she do for Mossad? Well, that's classified, of course. It appears that in her mid-20s, Livni, pictured below, had a posting in Paris, where she reportedly kept an eye on one of the agency's safehouses. Wilder suggestions that she was somehow involved in chasing terrorists across Europe have been denied. After a year abroad, she returned to Israel, got married and after two years' service left the agency and became a commercial lawyer.</p> <p>Not a long career as a spy then, though longer than that of George Bush senior, who was Director of Central Intelligence for all of 355 days before he became vice-president and then president of the US; but much shorter than that of Vladimir Putin, who was a KGB officer for well over a decade before becoming president and now prime minister of Russia. Perhaps for each of their constituencies it helped Bush and Putin that they had been involved in clandestine operations. Elsewhere in the world it may not be such a big deal, perhaps even a hindrance to have been deeply immersed in a profession that relies so heavily on dissemblance and trickery. In Israel, however, it's seen slightly differently.</p> <p>Despite Livni's two years with Mossad, the general perception of her is as someone with unusually little military or security experience. She wouldn't be the first Israeli prime minister with a Mossad background - Yitzhak Shamir was in the agency for a decade. But Israel is a country where politicians with a military career behind them still seem to have the edge in public opinion (think of Ariel Sharon, Ehud Barak, Yitzhak Rabin and Menachem Begin). In the end the question could be whether Livni was enough of a spy to succeed as a politician. </p> <p><strong>Rory McCarthy</strong></p> <h2>Should maths be taught differently?</h2> <p>School inspectors this week reported that nearly half of all maths lessons are not good enough. Children, according to the Ofsted report published yesterday, are being drilled to pass exams at the expense of really getting to grips with mathematical concepts. The report said while children may be achieving more maths qualifications, about 10% of secondary school pupils were making inadequate progress in maths and 45% of classes were adequate or worse. Ofsted, which based its findings on 192 primary and secondary schools, warned that today's pupils were leaving school ill-equipped to deal with the numeracy challenges they will face in later life.</p> <p>The findings come in a week when understanding what impact the global stockmarket chaos will have on your own profit and loss account has proved particularly taxing - even for those whose mathematical competence is not in question.</p> <p>So, do we all need to improve our mathematical and financial literacy? </p> <p>Yes we do, according to Tony Gardiner, reader in mathematics and mathematics education at the University of Birmingham. Maths lessons in schools have to be made more challenging in order to turn on a new generation to the appeal of maths. He believes if teachers remain locked into teaching to tests, we are in danger of creating a nation of \"experts in one-piece jigsaws - you don't have to think to practice them\". Until children have the chance to tackle mathematical concepts in greater depth they will continue to turn their backs on the subject. \"That is a tragedy,\" he warns, \"because you end up with people at the Department for Children, Schools and Families who are all English or history graduates who know nothing about maths, who then take decisions about the subject.\" </p> <p><strong>Debbie Andalo</strong></p>",
  "<p>Had Marx and Engels lived to see the day! The counting houses of global finance in freefall, traders going to the wall, and now Washington seemingly intent on nationalising its entire banking sector. As stockmarkets crash around the world, what we are now witnessing is an old-fashioned, full-throttle crisis of capitalism, and no event was more inclined to lift the mood of communism's founding fathers. </p> <p>In the 1850s Friedrich Engels was in Manchester, earning his and Karl Marx's crust working for his father's cotton-thread business, Ermen &amp; Engels. After the failure of the 1848 revolutions, both men had concluded that communism's best chance lay with an economic rupture brought about by capitalism's inherent instability. And from within the very apex of global finance - the mills, counting houses and Royal Exchange of Cottonopolis, as Manchester was known - Engels reported back on the prospects of just such a collapse. As the mid-Victorian economic boom appeared to stumble and a worldwide credit crunch loomed in ways not dissimilar to the current denouement, Engels could not contain his glee. </p> <p>\"Speculation in railways is again reaching dazzling heights - since January 1 most shares have risen by 40%, and the worst ones more than any. \"\u00c7a promet!\" he announced in 1851 of another stockmarket bubble similarly out of control. Capitalism's finale was just around the corner: the railway frenzy was unsustainable, the East India market looked sub-prime while the British cloth industry was being hit by a flood of cheap cotton. </p> <p>\"If the crash in the market coincides with such a gigantic crop, things will be cheery indeed. Peter Ermen is already shitting his pants at the very thought of it, and the little tree-frog's a pretty good barometer,\" Engels wrote of his fearful business partner. Bankruptcies were picking up in London and Liverpool, overproduction was glutting the market, and Engels was adamant the crash would kick in by March 1852. It wasn't to be. Instead exports surged, wages rose, standards of living improved and the mid-Victorian boom ground inexplicably, frustratingly, on. </p> <p>Four years later Engels's optimism returned as the markets faltered. \"This time there'll be a dies irae such as has never been seen before: the whole of Europe's industry in ruins, all markets overstocked ... all the propertied classes in the soup, complete bankruptcy of the bourgeoisie, war and profligacy to the nth degree.\" And at last, he was right: overproduction in the textile markets and an unexpected hike in raw material costs led to a collapse of confidence in the cotton industry, then an HBOS-style run on the banks, and a spate of insolvencies. Like this week's collapsing stockmarkets, the 19th-century global economy shuddered as sugar, coffee, cotton and silk prices plummeted. </p> <p>\"The American crash is superb and not yet over by a long chalk,\" Engels wrote in October 1857. \"The repercussion in England would appear to have begun with the Liverpool Borough Bank. Tant mieux. That means that for the next three or four years, commerce will again be in a bad way. Nous avons maintenant de la chance.\" The conditions for revolution were ripe. With the capitalist mode of production in collapse, the working class would surely rise to the occasion. But two months into the crash the proletariat had still failed to realise its historic calling. \"There are as yet few signs of revolution, for the long period of prosperity has been fearfully demoralising,\" Engels noted gloomily. And by the following spring, business had picked itself up again on the back of new markets in India and China.</p> <p>The final hope lay with the 1860s cotton famine. Then, as now, the crisis of capitalism was US driven, with the civil war leading to a blockade of the south by the north, curtailing cotton exports into Lancashire. Hundreds of thousands of workers were sacked. \"You will readily understand that all the philistines are in a cold sweat,\" Engels reported in 1865 as the Liverpool docks emptied and 125,000 unemployed mill hands wandered the Manchester streets. \"A lot of people in Scotland are finished as well, and one fine day it's bound to be the turn of the banks, and that'd be the end of the matter.\" But it was another false dawn, as the British working class stoically endured further immiseration. By which time Engels had pretty much given up on them. \"The English proletariat's revolutionary energy has completely evaporated,\" he concluded. </p> <p>While few would expect any such militancy from laid-off bankers, what remains of the Marxist movement today is brimming with optimism that the financial crisis sounds the death knell of capitalism. With almost Alistair Darling-like doom, the International Committee of the Fourth International has declared that \"the contradictions within the world capitalist economy are now reaching the point where the type of financial catastrophe and social and economic devastation experienced in the 1930s is not only possible, but is increasingly likely\". </p> <p>I'm not so sure. The uncomfortable truth is that capitalism - assisted by a pliant state - has historically managed to extricate itself from similar crises and emerge ever more virulent. Marx died trying to explain away precisely such incongruities, while Engels chose a different route: building up a remarkable stockmarket portfolio while complaining about tax on his dividends. The final crisis has a little way to go.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Tristram Hunt's Penguin biography of Engels is published early next year <a href=\"mailto:tristramhunt@btinternet.com\">tristramhunt@btinternet.com</a></p>",
  "<p>I remember seeing a picture of Fidel Castro in a parade with lots of other Cubans. It was during the emergency years, the \"special period\" when Cuba's relationship with the Soviet Union had collapsed and there was little gas or oil or fertiliser; people were struggling to find enough to eat. It was perhaps Cuba's nadir, as a small Caribbean island nation considered a dangerous threat by its nearest neighbour, the United States - which, during this period, tightened its embargo. Fidel, tall, haggard, his clothes hanging more loosely than usual from his gaunt frame, walked soberly along, surrounded by thousands of likewise downhearted, fearful people: he, like them, waving a tiny red, white and blue Cuban flag. This photograph made me weep; not only because I love Fidel and the Cuban people, but also because I was envious.</p> <p>However poor the Cubans might be, I realised, they cared about each other and they had a leader who loved them. A leader who loved them. Imagine. A leader not afraid to be out in the streets with them, a leader not ashamed to show himself as troubled and humbled as they were. A leader who would not leave them to wonder and worry alone, but would stand with them, walk with them, celebrate with them - whatever the parade might be.</p> <p>This is what I want for our country, more than anything. I want a leader who can love us. This is not what we usually say, or think of, when we are trying to choose a leader. People like to talk about \"experience\" and war and the economy, and making Americans look good again. I care about all these things. But when the lights are out and I'm left with just the stars in a super-dark sky, and I feel the new intense chill that seems to be the underbreath of even the hottest day, when I know that global warming may send our planet into a deep freeze even before my remaining years run out, then I think about what it is that truly matters to me. Not just as a human, but as an American.</p> <p>I want a leader who can love us. And, truthfully, by our collective behaviour, we have made it hard to demand this. We are as we are, imperfect to the max, racist and sexist and greedy above all; still, I feel we deserve leaders who love us. We will not survive more of what we have had: leaders who love nothing, not even themselves. We know they don't love themselves because if they did they would feel compassion for us, so often lost, floundering, reeling from one bad thought, one horrid act to another. Killing, under order, folks we don't know; abusing children of whose existence we hadn't heard; maiming and murdering animals that have done us no harm. </p> <p>I would say that, in my lifetime, it was only the Kennedys, in national leadership, who seemed even to know what compassion meant; certainly John, and then Bobby, were unafraid to grow an informed and open heart. (After he left the White House, President Carter blossomed into a sheltering tree of peace, quite admirably.) I was a student at a segregated college in Georgia when John Kennedy was assassinated. His was a moral voice, a voice of someone who had suffered; someone who, when looking at us in the south, so vulnerable, so poor, so outnumbered by the violent racists surrounding us, could join his suffering with ours. The rocking chair in which he sat reminded us that he was somehow like us: feeling pain on a daily basis and living a full-tilt life in spite of it. And Bobby Kennedy, whom a mentor of mine, Marian Wright (later Edelman), brought to Mississippi years later. He had not believed there were starving children in the United States. Wright took him to visit the delta. Kneeling before these hungry children in the Mississippi dirt and heat, he wept. We were so happy to have those tears. Never before had we witnessed compassion in anyone sent out to lead us.</p> <p>The present administration and too many others before it have shown the most clear and unapologetic hatred for the American people. A contempt for our minds, our bodies and souls that is so breathtaking most Americans have numbed themselves not to feel it. How can they do this or that awful unthinkable thing, we ask ourselves and each other, knowing no one in power will ever bother to answer us. I'm sure we, the American people, are the butt of jokes by those in power. Our suffering not making a dent in their pursuit of goals that almost always bring more tragedy and degradation to our already fragile, disintegrating republic.</p> <p>Sometimes, reading a blog, which I do infrequently, I see that generations of Americans have been wilfully crippled, and can no longer spell or write a sentence. The money for their education has gone to blow off someone else's intelligent and beautiful head. Visiting a hospital, I see sick and frightened people who have no clue whether they will get the care they need or whether it will be 15 minutes of an incompetent physician's opinion. If we were loved there would be a doctor free of charge, on every block, with time to listen to us. Visiting our schools, I see no one has seriously thought about teaching Americans what to eat, just as no one at the national helm insists that we take sex education seriously and begin to unencumber our planet of the projected hordes (Earth's view) of coming generations She can no longer tolerate.</p> <p>Our taxes are collected without fail, with no input from us; sometimes, because we lack jobs, paid with money we have to borrow. Our children are sent places they never dreamed of visiting, to harm and make enemies of people who, prior to their arrival, had thought well of them. Kind, smart, freedom-loving Americans.</p> <p>When we are offered a John McCain, who is too old for the job (and I cherish old age and old men but not to lead the world when it is ailing), or a George Bush, or a Sarah Palin, how unloved we are as Americans becomes painfully plain. McCain talks of war with the nostalgia and forgetfulness of the very elderly; Palin talks of forcing the young to have offspring they neither want nor can sustain; both of them feel at ease, apparently, with the game in which their candidacy becomes more of a topic of discussion than whether the planet has a future under their leadership.</p> <p>Where does this leave us average Americans, who feel the chill of global warming, the devastation of war, the terror of the food crisis, the horror of advancing diseases? Hopefully with a sense of awakening: that we have had few opportunities to be led by those who have the capacity to care for us, to love us, and that we, in our lack of love for ourselves, have, too often, not chosen them. Perhaps with the certainty that though we are as we are and sorely imperfect, we still deserve someone in leadership who \"gets\" us, and that this self-defeating habit of accepting our leaders' contempt need not continue. Maybe with the realisation that we, the people, are truly the leaders, and that we are the ones we have been waiting for.</p> <p>I write on September 9, my father's birthday. A black farmer in Georgia, he risked his life to vote in the 1930s for a \"new deal\".

  "<p>In this presidential election, the west is supposed to be a <a href=\"http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/out_west_land_of_opportunity_for_the_democrats/C530/L37/\">battleground region in presidential politics</a>. That's not a bad assumption, given the <a href=\"http://pollster.com/\">polls</a>: New Mexico tilts towards Obama; Colorado, Montana, and Nevada are deadlocked; and Wyoming, Utah, Idaho, and Arizona tilt towards McCain.</p> <p>Barack Obama is taking the region seriously. In Montana, for example, his campaign has at least <a href=\"http://www.flatheadbeacon.com/articles/article/the_ground_game/5106/\">16 offices</a>, the candidate has visited the state five times and his vice presidential selection, Joe Biden <a href=\"http://www.abc2news.com/news/local/story.aspx?content_id=82486a57-0e9b-4b14-97f4-28c1b0a9d5a0\"> visited the state</a> shortly after the Democratic convention.</p> <p>So what did candidates say in their respective conventions to woo western voters?</p> <p>While access to, and rights to use, water is probably the biggest issue affecting westerners, both candidates steered clear of that particular issue. And probably wisely so \u2013 <a href=\"http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761589807/water_policy_in_the_american_west.html\">water rights in the west</a> is a big, tangled, bureaucratic mess and a very sensitive topic. When John McCain called to renegotiate water rights among Western states, for example, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0808/12697.html\">all hell broke loose</a>. \"Over my cold, dead, political carcass,\" said Colorado candidate for Senate, <a href=\"http://www.bobschafferforsenate.com/\">Bob Schaffer</a>. And that was the Republican candidate.</p> <p>Energy is a close second to water as an issue in western states. Most of the west was founded on, and continues to support itself by, the extraction of coal, oil, gas and timber. Because much of the western lands are state owned, leasing state land brings revenue to the state, usually to its rural school systems. Add that to the fact that the base of the western Democratic party was forged in the unions working in western mines and lumber mills, and there's tremendous pressure on both parties to ease environmental restrictions and promote drilling and mining. </p> <p>The Republicans, who receive much of their support from the corporate entities that run these industries, are strong advocates for drilling. In her speech at the Republican convention, Sarah Palin touted her state's <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/11/us/politics/11pipeline.html?_r=1&amp;hp=&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;oref=slogin&amp;adxnnlx=1221837170-H161Vik77+NqW1k9l3otbg\">plan to construct natural gas pipeline</a> as a gain for US energy independence. She offered up her state's oil fields for drilling to aid in the cause against terrorism. When Republican presidential nominee John McCain during his <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2008/09/john_mccains_acceptance_speech.html\">nomination acceptance speech</a> promised to \"drill new wells offshore and drill them now,\" the Convention crowd interrupted him with a chant of, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhvRQyRdVEI\">\"drill, baby, drill\"</a>.</p> <p>The Democrats took a softer tone, but they still promoted the use of oil and coal in US energy independence. Montana Governor Brian Schweitzer was assigned the task of explaining the Democrats' energy policy, and did so in <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNHysr_IluI\">a speech</a> that brought the Convention to its feet. He outlined a program that promoted alternative energy sources and conservation \u2013 but also promoted domestic drilling and the use of clean coal. Likewise, Barack Obama promised to \"tap our natural gas reserves\" and use \"clean coal\" as part of a plan to complete energy independence within a decade.</p> <p>Still, the thrust of the Democrats' message was that alternative energy and conservation should play a central \u2013 not subservient \u2013 role in a future US energy policy. Schweitzer's speech laid out a vision of a diverse set of energy sources for America that included wind, solar, geothermal and hydrogen in addition to coal and oil. Also, conservation is key. As Schweitzer put it, \"Barack Obama understands the most important barrel of oil is the one you don't use\". Obama reiterated his desire to center an energy plan around alternative energy sources, along with biofuel and nuclear power and conservation in part through increased mileage standards for cars.</p> <p>That doesn't play out as poorly as you'd think in western states. Because alongside the pressures in places like Montana, Wyoming and Colorado to drill and mine, a conservation ethic has emerged \u2013 to the Democrats' benefit \u2013 that seeks to protect the states' quickly vanishing wild places. As political writer David Sirota recently pointed out in the New York Times, the recent history of Republican-backed unfettered drilling has <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/18/magazine/18wwln-phenomenon-t.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogi\">driven westerners to the Democratic party</a>, because Democrats \"have found success recasting environmentalism as a defense of threatened water supplies, fishing spots and hunting grounds\". If drilling and mining brings revenue, then a Democratic party with a conservation ethic needs to propose use of state lands that both generates revenue and preserves the west's open spaces, lest the region fall back into the hands of pro-corporate conservatives who argue that environmentalism costs jobs. </p> <p>And that's where alternative energy sources come in.</p> <p>The high plains of the Rocky Mountains offer two resources that promise to make it the center of future of alternative energy production: <a href=\"http://thefraserdomain.typepad.com/energy/2008/05/land-for-larges.html\">wind and switchgrass</a>. Eastern Montana, for example, is one of the windiest spots in the country. If the state can build the infrastructure of high-transmission power lines to transfer the energy produced by gigantic wind farms, the state could become a major supplier of clean energy. Likewise, Montana's climate supports the kind of grasses used in the production of <a href=\"http://www.carboncommentary.com/2008/01/14/71\">cellulosic biofuels</a>, the alternative to corn-based biofuels. Harvesting switchgrass would require neither irrigation, or force our food supply to compete for corn, and it could ease the country's switch from a fuel-burning transportation infrastructure.</p> <p>The Republicans' cries of \"drill, baby, drill\" harkens back to the 1980s, when conservatives pointed to economically depressed mining and timber communities and successfully pinned the blame on environmentalists seeking to protect endangered habitat. Now the question is whether westerners will fall back into old habits and vote to bring back the oil rigs, or will they grasp the conservationist and long-term approach of the Democratic plan? </p> <p>I'm guessing the latter. Not out of any nod towards collective human intelligence, but because today's economic climate in the west is vastly different than in the 1980s, when the Republican rhetoric was so successful. In fact, during the recent economic downturn, the job rate in the west was still relatively unaffected: in this <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/pf/features/lists/state_unemployment/\">CNN June report</a>, the Dakotas, Utah, Wyoming, and New Mexico all ranked in the top ten for unemployment rates. Montana was close behind at fifteen and Colorado finished in the top half. </p> <p>Still, while employment is up, so is the cost of living. What's likely to be at the top of westerners' minds isn't jobs, but the rising cost of housing, healthcare and food.</p>",
  "<p>Bankers have gone to great lengths to damage our confidence in the banking sector. And loss of confidence and trust on this scale can't be fixed by banning a few <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3ceb0cc6-8618-11dd-959e-0000779fd18c.html?nclick_check=1\">short-selling speculators</a> or by nationalising a bank here, an insurance company there. Nor is confidence restored when ministers meet up with bankers on the quiet, and grant them monopoly powers (as with Lloyds). Or when central bankers flood banks with new loans (liquidity) backed by taxpayers. We assume bankers will abuse their monopoly power, and taxpayer-backed loans will not be repaid. That makes us nervous. <br> Above all, we can have little confidence if interest rates remain so high. Banks are cracking under huge debts and liabilities (like the outstanding $60 trillion-plus Credit Default insurance claims hidden away from regulators as \"swaps\"). How can they honour claims and debts if interest rates remain so high?  Oh and by the way, it is really difficult to retain confidence in the system if politicians assure us that interest rates are very low \u2013 contrary to what our own bank statements tell us. Or indeed that low interest rates caused the crisis. It is the deregulation of credit creation in the 1970s that is at the root of this crisis, and it was high, not low interest rates that made today's vast bubble of debt unpayable. Our politicians should catch up.  So how to fix this catastrophic mess and restore confidence?  First we have to think system-wide fixes, not quick fixes. We have to ignore the bleatings of the City, and subordinate all financiers to their proper role as servants of the economy, not masters.  Where do we start? We could begin where Roosevelt did in 1933, and declare a <a href=\"http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history.do?action=Article&amp;id=5755\">three-day bank holiday</a>. The Fed, the FSA and the Bank of England could then take time and check the books of banks for well-hidden toxic waste \u2013 undeclared liabilities. Only when regulators have a proper sense of the scale of the mess can they take decisive and appropriate action. Right now they are sloshing buckets of our money about, unsure as to the whereabouts of the financial <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/2817995.stm\">\"weapons of mass destruction\"</a> banks have hidden away.<br> Next we must end \"inflation targeting\" \u2013 just a cover for keeping interest rates high. Inflation is falling, not rising, and there is a grave risk of deflation. Think the 1930s, or Japan since 1990. High interest rates are great for lenders/creditors, but a killer for debtors, and there are far more debtors in the economy than savers. And if we are to face the threat of climate change, we need cheap, but not easy, money to help finance a Green New Deal.  Third the Bank of England should regain control over interest rates \u2013 all rates. The interbank lending rate (Libor) should no longer be set by a committee of private bankers meeting daily at the British Bankers Association. They must be set by a committee accountable to society, and, when setting rates, must consider the interests of all who make the economy work \u2013 labour and industry \u2013 not just finance.  These are the fixes needed to deal with systemic threats. We could expect them to restore and retain confidence for as long as they did after Keynes introduced system-wide fixes in the 1930s. That was a golden age of 40 years.</p>",
  "<p>Whatever the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/19/wallstreet.economics&quot;\">events of this week</a> mean, nobody should believe the overblown claims that the market crisis signals the death of \"free market\" ideology. Free market ideology has always been a servant to the interests of capital, and its presence ebbs and flows depending on its usefulness to those interests. </p> <p>During boom times, it's profitable to preach laissez faire, because an absentee government allows speculative bubbles to inflate. When those bubbles burst, the ideology becomes a hindrance, and it goes dormant while big government rides to the rescue. But rest assured: the ideology will come roaring back when the bailouts are done. The massive debts the public is accumulating to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/19/marketturmoil.stockmarkets\">bail out</a> the speculators will then become part of a global budget crisis that will be the rationalisation for deep cuts to social programmes, and for a renewed push to privatise what is left of the public sector. We will also be told that our hopes for a green future are, sadly, too costly. </p> <p>What we don't know is how the public will respond. Consider that in North America, everybody under the age of 40 grew up being told that the government can't intervene to improve our lives, that government is the problem not the solution, that laissez faire was the only option. Now, we <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/18/marketturmoil.creditcrunch\">are suddenly seeing</a> an extremely activist, intensely interventionist government, seemingly willing to do whatever it takes to save investors from themselves. </p> <p>This spectacle necessarily raises the question: if the state can intervene to save corporations that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/19/subprimecrisis.richardbitner\">took reckless</a> risks in the housing markets, why can't it intervene to prevent millions of Americans from imminent foreclosure? By the same token, if $85bn can be made instantly available to buy the insurance giant AIG, why is single-payer health care \u2013 which would protect Americans from the predatory practices of health-care insurance companies \u2013 seemingly such an unattainable dream? And if ever more corporations need taxpayer funds to stay afloat, why can't taxpayers make demands in return \u2013 like caps on executive pay, and a guarantee against more job losses? </p> <p>Now that it's clear that governments can indeed act in times of crises, it will become much harder for them to plead powerlessness in the future. Another potential shift has to do with market hopes for future privatisations. For years, the global investment banks have been lobbying politicians for two new markets: one that would come from privatising public pensions and the other that would come from a new wave of privatised or partially privatised roads, bridges and water systems. Both of these dreams have just become much harder to sell: Americans are in no mood to trust more of their individual and collective assets to the reckless gamblers on Wall Street, especially because it seems more than likely that taxpayers will have to pay to buy back their own assets when the next bubble bursts. </p> <p>With the World Trade Organisation talks off the rails, this crisis could also be a catalyst for a radically alternative approach to regulating world markets and financial systems. Already, we are seeing a move towards \"food sovereignty\" in the developing world, rather than leaving access to food to the whims of commodity traders. The time may finally have come for ideas like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobin_tax\">taxing trading</a>, which would slow speculative investment, as well as other global capital controls. </p> <p>And now that nationalisation is not a dirty word, the oil and gas companies should watch out: someone needs to pay for the shift to a greener future, and it makes most sense for the bulk of the funds to come from the highly profitable sector that is most responsible for our climate crisis. It certainly makes more sense than creating another dangerous bubble in carbon trading. </p> <p>But the crisis we are seeing calls for even deeper changes than that. The reason these junk loans were allowed to proliferate was not just because the regulators didn't understand the risk. It is because we have an economic system that measures our collective health based exclusively on GDP growth. So long as the junk loans were fuelling economic growth, our governments actively supported them. So what is really being called into question by the crisis is the unquestioned commitment to growth at all costs. Where this crisis should lead us is to a radically different way for our societies to measure health and progress. </p> <p>None of this, however, will happen without huge public pressure placed on politicians in this key period. And not polite lobbying but a return to the streets and the kind of direct action that ushered in the New Deal in the 1930s. Without it, there will be superficial changes and a return, as quickly as possible, to business as usual.</p>",
  "<p>John McCain, Republican candidate for US President, has joined his Democratic opponent Barack Obama in explaining how his administration would tackle science, technology and the environment.</p> <p>McCain has previously distanced himself from fellow Republican George Bush on scientific issues. He thinks the <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2007/10/15/mccain/\">US should do more to combat climate change</a>, wants <a href=\"http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/95212.php\">more research done on embryonic stem cells</a>, and <a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/06/19/mccain-reiterates-opposition-to-drilling-in-wildlife-refuge/\">opposes drilling in Arctic nature reserves</a>.</p> <p>But the selection of Sarah Palin as his running mate raised questions over his pro-science credentials. The Alaskan governor promotes the <a href=\"http://dwb.adn.com/news/politics/elections/story/8347904p-8243554c.html\">teaching of creationism in schools</a>, and her church believes it is possible to <a href=\"http://news.aol.com/elections/article/palins-church-promotes-gay-conversion/165471\">'convert' homosexuals to heterosexuality</a>. She claimed that the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/03/opinion/03friedman.html?em\">\"jury's still out\"</a> on whether humans cause climate change, and McCain himself has now <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/06/18/mccains-offshore-drilling_n_107872.html\">changed his mind on offshore drilling</a>, backing the right of individual states to explore for oil.</p> <p>Although Obama answered a list of questions posed by leading figures in American science two weeks earlier, McCain's supporters will hope that his belated response can answer some of his critics. The full list of answers from both candidates can be found on <a href=\"http://www.sciencedebate2008.com/www/index.php?id=42\">www.sciencedebate2008.com</a>. </p> <p>The website is a grass-roots initiative led by a number of scientists, and it received more than 38,000 questions for the candidates from members of the public, from which 14 were chosen. These are some of the highlights from their answers.</p> <p>To tackle <strong>climate change</strong>, McCain says he will introduce a cap-and-trade system with the target of a 60% reduction from 1990 levels by 2050. However, that figure <a href=\"http://gristmill.grist.org/story/2008/5/11/234820/850\">falls short of the 80% recommended by the IPCC</a> \u2013 which Obama says he would meet, using the same methods.</p> <p>On <strong>energy</strong>, McCain wants market-driven renewable energy sources, and a huge (<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/joseph-romm/mccain-calls-for-700-new_b_100053.html\">unrealistic?</a>) expansion in nuclear power. Obama, while also backing nuclear power, <a href=\"http://www.businessgreen.com/business-green/news/2224972/obama-invest-150m-renewables\">has impressed the green lobby</a> by saying he will invest in cleaner energy to the tune of $150bn over 10 years.</p> <p>Both candidates support overturning President Bush's ban on creating new cell lines for <strong>stem cell research</strong>, but make clear that they favour the use of unwanted eggs from fertility clinics for the research. Obama may have disappointed many scientists by not explicitly saying he will allow the use of eggs specifically created for such research, but some were concerned by <a href=\"http://blog.wired.com/wiredscience/2008/09/mccain-on-stem.html\">McCain's hints that he would criminalise the practice</a>.</p> <p>Obama claims that the nation's <strong>space programme</strong> is important, particularly for confronting scientific and technical problems here on Earth. <a href=\"http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/576839/john_mccains_space_program.html\">McCain, though, is noticeably more enthusiastic</a>. He wants NASA to begin a \"new era\" of human space exploration, and is very keen on completing the US lab on the International Space Station. Still, given his <a href=\"http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=9444\">antagonism towards Russia and China</a>, his motivations in \"ensuring the US remains a leader\" in space exploration could reflect concerns over those countries' extra-terrestrial activities, rather than scientific endeavour. </p> <p>For now, Obama seems to be slightly more progressive on the issues. But the real praise must go to the citizen-driven ScienceDebate2008 website, for making both candidates engage with science so comprehensively.</p>",
  "<p>1O DOWNING STREET <br>LONDON, SW1A 2AA </p> <p>THE PRIME MINISTER </p> <p>Dear colleague, <br> As we head to our conference in Manchester, our focus is upon helping <br>the British people come through this turbulent economic time, and on our defining mission of building a fairer Britain \u2013 winning the fight for Britain's <br>future. <br> <br>This week's international financial turbulence has shown that we are <br>going through a period of extraordinary global change that is taking us <br>into a new world. In this country we will take the tough, decisive action <br>necessary to protect the stability of the economy and to get the financial <br>system moving, as we have done this week and as we did with Northern <br>Rock. <br> <br>Our first task is immediate support for hard-pressed families struggling <br>with the impact of this global financial turbulence. That is why this month <br>we have been helping families with: <br> <br>\u2022 A comprehensive \u00a31 billion housing package that helps first- <br>time buyers; a one-year Stamp Duty holiday for all homes costing <br>under \u00a3175,000; and to help vulnerable homeowners in difficulty, <br>a new mortgage rescue scheme and a more generous safety net <br>to help prevent repossessions. <br> <br>\u2022 Help for families to reduce their energy bills \u2013 not just this <br>winter but permanently \u2013 with a \u00a31 billion increase in our national <br>programme for household energy efficiency. We have pledged to <br>increase: <br>a) the winter fuel payment by \u00a350 to all pensioners (and an <br>extra \u00a3100 for the over 80s) this winter; <br>b) eleven million older and vulnerable people will be eligible for <br>free loft and cavity wall insulation and other energy saving <br>measures that could save them up to \u00a3300 a year in their <br>energy bills. Every household will be eligible to get at least <br>50% off energy saving insulations. <br>c) Cold weather payments for the most vulnerable from \u00a38.50 <br>to \u00a325 a week. <br> <br>And we will encourage people to save an average of \u00a3150 per <br>household on pre-payment meters and \u00a3100 for households on <br>standard credit by switching suppliers and moving to direct debit, <br>in addition to the up to \u00a3300 of savings they can make through <br>energy efficiency measures. To make sure people across the <br>country can take advantage of the help on offer and save as much <br>money as possible, we will run a national TV and press information <br>campaign to publicise what help is available. <br> <br>\u2022 A \u00a3120 family tax cut that begins to come into force this <br>month. <br> <br>And as we face the challenges that change brings, we must restate the <br>case for our party and values. Fairness matters more at a time of <br>profound change such as this. <br> <br>Fair rules, fair chances, and a fair say for everyone: that is the new <br>deal for this new world. <br> <br>Fair rules with our tough measures to punish and prevent crime; with <br>neighbourhood policing a reality in our local communities; the new points <br>based system for immigration and new tougher, but fairer rules for <br>citizenship; and welfare reform so that those who can work, do work. <br> <br>Fair chances by investing in education and skills for all our people; help <br>for older people; and new support for parents to help ease the pressures <br>of bringing up children. <br> <br>And a fair say for all with a new approach to public services to give <br>parents, patients and the public greater control over the services they <br>use; a new wave of NHS reform to make the National Health Service a <br>personal health service; and accelerated schools reform. <br> <br>As we work to build a fairer Britain, we face a Conservative Party that <br>has changed its image, but has not undertaken a serious reappraisal of <br>policy or ideology. They have followed a deliberate strategy of avoiding <br>difficult policy choices but when they do make decisions, we see their <br>instincts still lead them down the road of policies that are unchanged and <br>unfair: <br> <br>\u2022 On tax, their first priority is to divert \u00a31 billion to the 3,000 richest <br>estates in Britain; <br> <br>\u2022 On levels of investment in public services, David Cameron says <br>the differences between Labour and the Tories will be 'dramatic' <br>and 'fundamental'. And they have committed to cuts to Sure Start <br>and to cut \u00a34.5 billion from school building plans; <br> <br>\u2022 And on tackling poverty, they refuse to commit to Labour's target <br>on child poverty and the means by which we are cutting child <br>poverty. <br> <br>I am confident that we can come through this difficult time and meet the <br>challenges we face a stronger, more secure, and fairer country than <br>before. <br> <br>And that we can show people more clearly that the choice at the next <br>election will be between a Conservative Party which still believes in <br>helping the few and not the many; and a Labour Party which believes in <br>fairness and opportunity for all and has the policies to deliver them. <br> <br>Yours sincerely, <br> <br>GORDON BROWN MP</p>",
  "<p>Having Margaret Thatcher round for tea would not suit many Labour supporters.

The Tories \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2008/aug/22/davidcameron.conservatives\">nudge</a> nudge, wink wink\" politics would be worse for millions. It's time we picked ourselves up off the floor and came out fighting for a fourth term.</p>",
  "<p>It is now clear that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/19/marketturmoil.stockmarkets\">present</a> financial crisis is second only to the great crash of 1929. Then the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/19/wallstreet.economics\">consequences</a> of the financial meltdown were hugely compounded by a wider political failure to grasp the nature of what was unfolding. In the British context, that situation looks like repeating itself. All the main political parties appear lost in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/marketturmoil\">macro-economic storm</a>, not least because all of the leading politicians have been thoroughly schooled in obeisance to the free market. After all, this was never supposed to happen \u2013 free from the burden of intervention and regulation, banks were thought to be ever more finely attuned to risk and its resultant entrepreneurial reward. Unfortunately for them and us this ideology has now imploded in <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2008/sep/19/banking.banks\">spectacular fashion</a> \u2013 and what makes it all the more galling is that the state, the supposed enemy of the market, is the one that is bailing out finance capital. Where through a version of <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/17/wallstreet.useconomy\">socialism for the rich</a>, losses are nationalised and the already wealthy keep their payoffs and past profits.</p> <p>However, the Conservatives without quite realising it have already embraced part of the answer to the current economic crisis \u2013 localism. The economic disaster now engulfing us is a direct result of financial globalisation and the resultant monopoly and speculation that this has encouraged. For instance the \"free market\" allowed a monopoly accrual of debt (which is what Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac achieved in the US) and the speculative reclassification of this debt as an asset. Securitising this debt across the globe as a stable income stream allowed the huge augmentation of credit and the initiation and expansion of the asset price bubble. However this process undermined the very assets on which the original debts were written \u2013 since other debts subsequently made to the both the prime and subprime market were written not on ability to pay but on the now speculatively enhanced asset price itself. This system fed on itself until someone somewhere became unable to pay, as happened in the subprime crisis where, because of the hidden penal interest rates levied on the poor, the whole system unraveled.</p> <p>The current Conservative emphasis on decentralisation and the development of local societies offers a real though unexplored alternative to much of the foregoing. If localism is to flourish it needs a corresponding political economy, so far the Tories have defined this in terms of disaggregating to communities state funds and public grants. Yet there is another source of disempowering monopoly: the market. Corporate capital has outcompeted local small businesses so that our towns and cities have become clones of each other with the same chain stores, restaurants and retail outlets. All of this sucks money out of the regional economy, with only 50 pence of every pound spent in corporate outlets returning to the locality \u2013 as against \u00a32 returning to the area for every pound spent in a local business. </p> <p>If we were able to generate a local economy, then why not decentralise finance as well, and create, as David Cameron has already intimated, local cooperatives and indeed guilds around which people could invest? Then, we could reinvent capital as also local and not just global. Moreover, a local onshore economy can genuinely be better regulated and it is far more likely to engage in real as opposed to purely speculative investment. Conservatives should not accept that their \"society of ownership\" could be undermined by monopoly speculation at the global level. Instead, decentred local systems of finance (through public private partnerships, enhanced credit unions or indeed building societies) could secure the poor in their housing without securitising their debt, or indeed subjecting them to hidden usurious rates of interest. </p> <p>What's more, local economies that developed regional and city based sources of credit (what I have elsewhere called patriotic capital) would be far less exposed to international financial crises, while being able to develop regional export expertise to diversify our economy, as silicon valley as done in the US, or as Germany has done with advanced manufacturing, or Italy with its luxury goods sector. The conservative idea for a reinvention of guilds and conservative cooperatives is then uniquely prescient \u2013 since this would generate income that remained within the locality. Moreover, we could construct tax or trading incentives where finance that remained local had home ground advantage. </p> <p>Of course, this is only part of the answer, and any such micro-approach requires re-envisaging the macro-economic environment. There all parties, including the Conservatives, have to rethink the entire economic paradigm; the offshore, off-balance sheet, tax-avoiding economy has successfully evaded all the half-hearted attempts at capital and leverage regulation. But it is always the onshore, tax-paying public that has to meet the bills. </p> <p>There is really only one alternative, under the auspices of a new international settlement: disaggregate the global network back to the countries and nations that generate the wealth and end up paying the bill. After all, that is just Conservative emphasis on localism applied at the global level.</p>",

  "<p>Waterstone's was named bookseller of the year at an awards ceremony last night, where it was praised for getting back to a focus on excellence in writing, and holding firm in increasingly hostile market conditions.</p> <p>The chain has previously been overlooked for the award, which went in previous years to Blackwell, Borders and Amazon. \"What made Waterstone's famous in the good old days was that it was a bookshop about books \u2013 a national chain of independent booksellers,\" said Neill Denny, editor-in-chief of the Bookseller magazine, which runs the awards. \"Some of that pizzazz got lost along the way a bit, but Waterstone's has now got a lot of it back.\"</p> <p>He drew attention to Waterstone's Writer's Year campaign, which has seen new writers such as Aravind Adiga and Ross Raisin highlighted, as well the Writer's Table promotion featuring top book picks from established names Philip Pullman and Sebastian Faulks. \"This is Waterstone's saying we're about writers, which is exactly what they should be doing,\" Denny said. \"They're getting back to the basics of bookselling, which is a love of books.\"</p> <p>Borders was named children's bookseller of the year for the second year running, while best children's independent was London's Tales on Moon Lane. Author Mark Billingham, presenting the award, lauded sponsor Walker Books for its \"condemnation of age banding\" \u2013 the controversial scheme from publishers to include age guidance on the covers of children's books.</p> <p>The Watermill Bookshop in Aberfeldy in the Scottish highlands was picked as independent bookseller of the year; located in a former watermill, it combines bookshop, art gallery and music and coffee shop. </p> <p>Another independent, Norfolk Children's Book Centre, beat WHSmith to win the green retail initiative of the year award. The shop has used a wind turbine to produce much of its power for the last nine years, has energy-saving lighting and low carbon heating as well as stocking a wide range of environment-focused books.</p> <p>Denny reserved special praise for the three independent winners. \"All three demonstrate in different ways why the independent bookshop is staging a renaissance, with customers returning and the overall number of independents rising again after many years of decline,\" he said. \"People are becoming bored with clone town high streets and are supporting their local bookshops quite deliberately, because they want to support the diversity they bring. These three shops are excellent examples of that trend; successful, progressive businesses changing the game for bookshops.\"</p>",
  "<p>Erin Brockovich, the campaigner who was immortalised in an Oscar-winning film, today urged oil giant Shell to reroute a controversial gas pipeline in the west of Ireland. </p> <p>The former legal clerk, who famously took on a major power company accused over toxic leaks, gave her backing to campaigners opposing the development in north county Mayo. </p> <p>Brockovich said the pipeline should be relocated if it affected residents' health or property. Shell has denied that the project affects either.</p> <p>\"There is no compromise when it comes to health and safety, and Shell should respect that,\" Brockovich said. </p> <p>\"If it is family land or some type of heritage land or preserved land, they've got to go around it. </p> <p>\"If a condition exists where a company like Shell needs to be in a location and there are residences, you need to move them.\"</p> <p>Brockovich was portrayed by the actor Julia Roberts in the 2000 hit movie after winning a multi-million dollar legal battle against the energy firm PG&amp;E for families affected by contaminated water in a Californian town. </p> <p>She said she was confident that a compromise between the campaigners and Shell could be reached after discussing the matter with Irish environment minister and Green Party leader, John Gormley. </p> <p>Brockovich also said a 10-day hunger strike by campaigner Maura Harrington was not the most effective way to reach a resolution. </p> <p>Harrington, a retired school principal, called off her drastic action today when a pipe-laying ship left Irish waters. </p> <p>\"I would want her to eat,\" Brockovich said. \"I clearly understand it's her way of making a very, very strong statement about something she feels strongly about, but I would want her to eat because we need to eat.\" </p> <p>The Shell to Sea demonstrators oppose attempts to lay a pipeline which will transport untreated and odourless gas from the Corrib gas field to an inland refinery because of health and environmental fears. </p> <p>\"I completely understand their concerns,\" Brockovich said. \"I deal with issues in the United States where pipelines have been put in, they've leaked and created health problems. </p> <p>\"Many people are in favour of progress, but they're not in favour of progress to the point where you degrade our environment and jeopardise our public health and safety.\" </p> <p>Brockovich is in Dublin to speak about the benefits of eating organic food. She will give a lecture at University College Dublin tomorrow as part of Glenisk Organic Dairy's celebrations for National Organic Week.</p>",
  "<p>I was born and raised in hurricane country, on the Gulf Coast of Texas. Each hurricane leaves its own fingerprint on landscapes and lives, but some things remain the same. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/13/naturaldisasters.usa\">Hurricane Ike</a> is no different</p> <p>If you ever want to know what the end of the world might look like, hurricanes give you a pretty good window into human behaviour. Unlike the wildfires of California, tornadoes of Oklahoma, blizzards of Michigan or droughts of the southwest, Hurricanes are unique among natural disasters because they tell you that they are coming.</p> <p>The national media descends on coastal communities hoping to be perfectly positioned at the exact point of maximum devastation and calamity, anticipating the destruction and loss of human life as if it is some type of sporting event. Maybe it is for them.</p> <p>Television personalities, such as <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200506/pappu\">Geraldo Rivera</a> of Fox News, stand precariously among the crashing waves that precede the storm's arrival, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eywtQOyzjwQ\">describing what we can all clearly see</a> with out own eyes, without the dramatic voice-overs. For his efforts during Hurricane Ike, Geraldo was rewarded when <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J52xbx2__OY\">video of him falling face first</a> into the surf off Galveston Island went viral on the internet hours before Ike made landfall. Geraldo and hurricanes is becoming <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTknW1btHaM&amp;feature=related\">annoying national tradition</a>.</p> <p>While the national media clamours for destruction on a massive scale, the truth is that hurricanes typically take their greatest toll after the storm has passed, when the glare of national media attention has faded away. One can only wish that instead of frolicking in the surf in the hours before Ike hit, the media had spent more time telling people that the waves crashing ashore were less of a danger than the generators, chainsaws and candles sitting in viewer's homes. These things aren't as sensational as storm surges and 100mph winds, but they are just as deadly.</p> <p>In Ike's aftermath, entire families are getting sick and dying in their sleep from the carbon monoxide poisoning caused by <a href=\"http://www.kten.com/Global/story.asp?S=9005672\">gas-powered generators</a>. As of Tuesday, more than 30 people had been <a href=\"http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ap/tx/6004564.html\">treated for carbon monoxide poisoning</a> in Houston. <a href=\"http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ap/tx/6006107.html\">Two Houston men died</a> when they ran their gas-powered generator in the kitchen. In Beaumont, an hour and a half east of Houston, 10 people were rushed to the hospital for carbon monoxide poisoning, seven adults and three young children. They too were <a href=\"http://www.kten.com/Global/story.asp?S=9005672\">running the generator inside the house</a>. That number will continue to grow. No matter how many times officials <a href=\"http://www.kplctv.com/Global/story.asp?S=9004307&amp;nav=0nqx\">tell people not to run generators</a> indoors, people continue to do so.</p> <p>Generators aren't the only post-hurricane killers. People are ding in house fires because of <a href=\"http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ap/tx/6006107.html\">unattended candles</a>. They are being seriously injured cutting down trees and cleaning up debris. The fact that someone owns a chainsaw in no way qualifies them to chop down or remove trees that can weigh thousands of pounds. Even when qualified, tree cutting is still dangerous. One of the first Ike fatalities was <a href=\"http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/front/6008126.html\">10-year-old Joel Smith</a>. He was killed when a tree fell on him when his parents were cutting it down in preparation for the storm.</p> <p>Many people are killed in one fell swoop when the Gulf of Mexico surges ashore, but more people will die in the aftermath day by day when the methods they use to cope with the storm kills them instead.</p> <p>After every storm, local AM radio still is the absolute best source of information. We used to huddle around when we were children listening to what was going on in the world beyond out neighbourhood. Unlike most televisions, which require electricity, radios can function on battery power. In addition, most television anchors and reporters appear to be auditioning during hurricane coverage, hoping that thrusting about in hurricane-force winds might propel them to some bigger more prominent position. Like Geraldo or <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx7-8Rv62LU\">this idiot from the Weather Channel</a> who was blown into shrubs while standing outside in hurricane force winds. I had to chuckle when I saw a dancing bear ruin a live shot while some reporter was doing their best dramatic voice over <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKwMiExUKXg\">describing the destruction of a fishing pier</a>.</p> <p>Local AM radio is the exact opposite. The focus is on getting information from residents who have been affected by the storm. The drama of radio isn't some fabricated television shot by a producer, but listening to ordinary citizens report how their lives have actually been impacted by the storm. Information about gas, lights, ice, flooding doesn't come from some cub reporter from out of town. It comes from the little old lady who calls in to say there's water filling her front yard. Internet streaming allows anyone to listen to local radio even when they've evacuated out of radio range. My parents have been listening to KLVI.com, which covers our hometown. Local AM radio is all hurricane coverage all the time. It will be for weeks.</p> <p><em>This is the first of a two-part article on the aftermath of Hurricane Ike in Texas. Part two will appear tomorrow.</em></p>",
  "<p>It's 4am in the morning. You're lying awake in the worry hour. You know that, even if there was nothing to fret about, your brain would come up with something. But this time, the anxieties are thundering past, like delayed trains chasing the clock.<br> Can I trust the bank to look after my money? Clickety clack. How much has my house fallen in value? Clickety clack. Will high fuel prices mean I can't keep my car on the road? Can I afford to buy enough food for the family? Clickety clack. Will I lose my job, and why is everyone making me paranoid about climate change when there's nothing I can do about it? Clickety, clickety clack \u2026 and then back to the beginning. The \"triple crunch\" of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/marketturmoil\">credit-fuelled financial crisis</a>, accelerating <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/climate/\">climate change</a> and soaring <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/more-big-increases-in-energy-prices-913311.html\">energy prices</a> \u2013 how did we get into this mess? In the face of so many simultaneous crises, we all have legitimate questions for the governments that allowed us to sleepwalk into this situation. <br> These are no longer abstract, distant issues of financial and environmental policy. They are beginning to affect everyone.  A general sense of having our livelihoods and wellbeing neglected by the people elected to govern us can easily tip over into an understandable sense of outrage and having been betrayed. Down these highly charged tracks lie the possibility for both progressive and poisonous political trains of thought to emerge.  For that reason, we must be quick to spell out how peoples' genuine concerns and fears can become a force for change that is necessary in economic and environmental terms, and socially progressive. But how can we make sure that the junction box switches the emotional tracks to progress, rather than a poisonous reaction? We talk about the issues straight on, using the language with which people experience them.  First, if you're sitting there feeling angry and worried, good, you should be. Things are out of control. With very few rules, the banks have played fast and loose with their lending, making some individuals very rich in the process. But often the money they lend you has been created out of thin air with nothing real to anchor it, by \u2013 in effect \u2013 an accounting trick. This has made the value of things like your home very volatile \u2013 rising and falling \u2013 making it hard to plan your life \u2026 The answer is that we need many more checks and balances to curb such damaging instability, to protect the value of your assets and make it easier to plan your life.</p> <p>Next, our leaders and big businesses have been reckless in failing to plan for the end of the oil age. As global demand goes up and supply can't match it, the price is permanently high and on a long-term rising trend. The cost of warming your home and travelling around will keep going up.<br> But, it's not too late. Massive efforts to increase renewable energy, conserve what's left, and find more fuel-efficient ways to get around and grow food, will give us security, meet our needs and, very possibly, give us better quality of life. Food seems expensive (although in reality we're spending less on it now than we did decades ago), but as long as farming stays heavily dependent on oil to grow and transport what we eat, it will remain so. Yet, if we grow not all, but more food locally and use less oil to do so, we can curb future food-bill rises. We can also bring bills down by preparing more of our own food, and cutting down on costly packaging and pre-prepared food. As oil starts to run out, in the UK and all over the world, there will have to be a shift away from large-scale, oil and gas-guzzling farming, to smaller, lower-input or organic farms. There's no easy dodge for the last issue, and just like when a doctor is nervous about giving a full prognosis, the patients, all of us, have a right to know the truth. Climate change is real and dangerous. The trigger for potentially irreversible, runaway effects is just around the corner, as little as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/01/climatechange.carbonemissions\">99 months away</a> and counting.<br> But, unlike some big global political issues against which we all feel powerless, like cold wars and hot wars, as far as climate change is concerned, we can all do something. Instead of feeling helpless, there is a new importance to our lives. Everything we do from now on really matters. We must lead by example \u2013 for instance by changing our energy supplier to a renewable one, using less and changing how we travel.  And we mustn't let our governments off the hook. It's not tenable for the prime minister to say he's concerned about the impact of climate change on Britain and the world's poorest, and then allow new runways and <a href=\"http://www.eon-uk.com/generation/kingsnorth.aspx\">coal-fired power stations</a>. Instead of trying to derail clean energy targets in Europe, the government should be implementing plans for dramatic decarbonisation of the electricity supply, reduced energy use in buildings, an increase in renewables on the scale needed, and a huge expansion of clean reliable, public transport. <br> If Britain leads by example too, then the rest of the world, countries like India and China, may just follow. They certainly won't if we don't. The stakes couldn't be higher, but this is something that everyone can do. The answer to many of these problems is investing in a massive environmental transformation programme amounting to a <a href=\"http://www.neweconomics.org/gen/greennewdealneededforuk210708.aspx\">green new deal</a>. It is a comprehensive programme designed to stabilise the economy, create jobs, tackle poverty and inequality and help protect us from the vulnerable supply lines of the global food and energy markets.<br> The rules of the game are designed by policy-makers and they can be changed. So far, the voting public has been horrendously let down. Now, we all have a chance to speak up and get on the train for positive change. If we do so, we'll probably even sleep better at night.</p> <p><em>On Friday September 19 a <a href=\"www.neweconomics.org\">new economics foundation</a>/Guardian event will discuss 'Triple crunch: Can we solve the credit crunch, climate change and energy price shocks with a Green New Deal?'

  "<p>All things considered in the current financial crisis you'd expect more from the left about the collapse of capitalism and the opportunities this presents for socialism and other forms of collective activity. My fear is the chief outcome may not be the doubtful benefits of nationalisation, but nationalism.</p> <p>From what I've read, in Wednesday's Guardian G2 for instance, the left response is muted and uncertain, rather than jubilant. Try as I may I can't get it out of my mind that the collapse is a rather more lethal, self-inflicted version of what al Qaida tried on 9/11. The financial sector just bombed itself.</p> <p>Caution on the left stems partly from an awareness that a lot of ordinary people are getting hurt as the buildings tumble on Wall St and in the City. \"It's the flower sellers and the hairdressers, as well as the bankers losing their jobs,\" a friend reminded me last night.</p> <p>And, of course, it all arises against a familiar, enduring background: the loss of confidence arising from the collapse of Soviet communism, the morphing of China into a form of market Stalinism and beyond, the retreat of social democratic models as capital reasserted itself in most developed states.</p> <p>In such an apocalyptic mood all sorts of odd things happen. The Daily Mail rails against <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1056800/Spivs-sharks-champagne-corks-popping-Meltdown-Monday.html\">\"City spivs\" who \"go short\" on share prices </a>and help destroy the value of otherwise sound firms (the government's ban has been widely welcomed today). And the Open Democracy website <a href=\"http://www.opendemocracy.net/article/the-end-of-american-capitalism\">posts an FT article by Willem Buiter</a>, LSE prof and former member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee under an \"end of capitalism as we know it\" headline.</p> <p>Maybe. But as others point out, the philosopher, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/17/recession.labour\">Michael Onfray in G2</a> for instance, capitalism has a great adaptability. When delegates at the TUC recommended a return to widespread nationalisation \u2013 \"it's even back in America\" \u2013 they didn't find a strong echo. </p> <p>After the Great Depression and World War II \u2013 when more of the British economy was centrally controlled than Hitler's and to better effect \u2013 many people concluded that state ownership of strategic industries would prove more efficient. I used to think so myself. But in normal conditions, not a war crisis, it doesn't fit human behaviour patterns quite so well. </p> <p>So in George Bush's Washington, it's a sensible but temporary response to an extraordinary collapse, predictable though it was to many people who suspended disbelief. Markets rallied sharply today after Washington wrote its blank cheque to mop up banks bad debts. Have we touched bottom? Not necessarily, the market lemmings stick together on the way down as well as up. </p> <p>Either way capitalism will be back, soberer than it has been for 20 years \u2013 until the next crisis comes along. Hopefully, it will be better regulated and less arrogant. Remember just how ignorant about real life \u2013 and their own worth \u2013 City bankers showed themselves to be when interviewed for Polly Toynbee and David Walker's new book, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/aug/04/workandcareers.executivesalaries\">Unjust Rewards</a>. It seems a long time ago now \u2013 but it wasn't.</p> <p>Most of the technical proposals for shutting assorted stables doors now that they've fallen off are above my pay grade. The Guardian had a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/19/economy.marketturmoil\">good leader </a>this morning, but rightwing media is also chastened as the dominoes fall. It would be nice to think the balance of forces in society will be re-tilted more in favour of labour \u2013 the workers by hand and by brain, as the old Clause IV phrase put it \u2013 and away from the demands of unfettered markets. Babies and bathwater come to mind.</p> <p>What intrigues me is how it will all play out in the longer term. For instance, when HBOS is folded into Lloyds TSB and Scotland finally loses one of its two great banks, how does that play among Scots voters eyeing the SNP government in Edinburgh? The Union of 1707 arose in part from the collapse of the Scottish banking system in the wake of the failed colonisation at Darien in Panama. </p> <p>Could a banking crisis also trigger the end of the same Union? Or will voters, who know that Scotland's financial services industries have done almost as well as England's inside the Union, look nervously at events and stick with Britain? Impossible to say, but it's worth asking. Alex Salmond is already doing his best to offload the blame down south. Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling are both Edinburgh politicians too, as Halifax has just been forced to notice.</p> <p>Ditto Britain's relationship with the European Central Bank, the eurozone. Will we end up inside the safety of the larger monetary pool when it's all over? Or will the merits of going it alone be re-asserted by the bumpy ride now underway. A lot rides on the performance of the Treasury, Bank of England and FSA, the Brown-created tripartite system which started the crisis badly \u2013 Britain usually does - but may yet be seen to have had a good war.</p> <p>The biggest question of all is the damage done to the United States and to its model of capitalism for the past 30 years. Over drinks last night several friends, old enough to be old lefties, instinctively argued that Bush II - Iraq and Guantanamo, not to mention Hurricane Katrina - had finished off American soft power \u2013 as an admired global model - and that the Wall St crash is now finishing its hard power. It can't afford global hegemonic ambitions any more.</p> <p>As usual I retain more faith in the recuperative powers of the United States, though as usual I think it's pushing its luck. A presidential win for Barack Obama would reassure the wider world that the US is set to mend its ways \u2013 though there's no guarantee he can actually address necessary change. The McCain/Palin ticket would have a harder job \u2013 though you can never tell there either. Nor can we yet be sure which candidate will benefit from the financial crisis. On paper it should be Obama (McCain made an over-optimistic gaffe on the economy this week), but voters may go counter-intuitive.</p> <p>The real shift here surely is one of power - from west to east and south. China, India and other major developing countries which have ambiguous feelings towards Europe and the US, both its economic and political models, will be quietly sitting back and enjoying it. Some Asian sovereign funds which have lost money holding dollars or US shares will seek to recoup losses and exploit American weakness by buying up companies in any passing fire sale.</p> <p>Great states rise and fall, sometimes very quickly on a few important mistakes. China was already in highly nationalistic mood. To that we may now add righteous indignation. Have we just witnessed a tipping point?</p>",

  "<p>Seated in the courtyard of a cafe on west London's Portobello Road, Reem Kelani is reading aloud a poem by Mahmoud Darwish, the poet and writer who became a symbol of the struggle for Palestinian nationalism and whose death last month led to an outpouring of grief among those, like Kelani, who knew and respected his life's work. </p> <p>Kelani used Darwish's poem, Mawwaal: Variations on Loss, as the lyrical backbone for a musical composition on her critically acclaimed debut album, Sprinting Gazelle, released in 2006. She will perform it - \"I always have it. People go crazy if I don't include a Darwish poem,\" she tells me - along with other traditional poems and songs from Palestine and the diaspora, rendered in her trademark jazz-laced style, at a concert in London next week as part of the Barbican's Ramadan Nights series.</p> <p>On the day we meet, Kelani recites Darwish's verses to me in English, in order to elucidate the appeal of his politics. \"They asked me, 'Do you love the beautiful woman?' and I replied, 'My love is worship. Her hair is lavish and abundant, her breast the dearest pillow. Wedding her is a sign of valour',\" Kelani intones. </p> <p>\"He's talking about Palestine,\" she explains. \"It's totally non-compromising but anyone could relate to this, I think.\"</p> <p>Anyone but the British music industry, it seems. Kelani, a Palestinian singer born in Manchester and raised in Kuwait by her father who comes from Ya'bad near Jenin and her mother who hails from Nazareth in Galilee, initially struggled to get a record contract here because of her subject matter. </p> <p>\"On my CD cover I was very careful,\" she says. \"I did not say 'from Palestine'. I said 'from the motherland'. I'm walking on eggshells all the time.\"</p> <p>Palestinians, too, are divided in their response to her. \"Many Palestinians criticised me because I didn't have the colours of the Palestinian flag on [the cover of Sprinting Gazelle], because I didn't have a picture of a child throwing a stone at an Israeli tank,\" Kelani says. \"Some Muslim Palestinians don't like the fact that I sang one song in a Christian Eastern style. Secular Palestinians don't like the fact that on the Sprinting Gazelle song I praise the prophet Muhammad.\"</p> <p>Her political commitment is evident, however, in the catalogue number of the Sprinting Gazelle CD: 48, a reference to 60 years ago - the formation of the state of Israel in 1948 and, from the Palestinian perspective, al-Nakba (the catastrophe).</p> <p>\"There is a message that Palestinians don't exist, so my narrative is that I exist - my narrative is my existence, both personally and collectively \u2026 As a human being, as a woman, as a Palestinian.\" </p> <p>Kelani's musical mission, it could be said, is to educate the world, and the west in particular, about Arabic history and culture, to trace a musical map of Palestine and the Middle East - her next project is on the Egyptian composer Sayyid Darwish (1892-1923). It was not, however, always like this. </p> <p>\"I'm a newcomer to Arabic music,\" Kelani explains. \"I didn't like it until I was in my teens and saw a group of women singing at a wedding in a village outside of my maternal hometown of Nazareth in 1974. That was the first time. Global pop was taking over. I was a David Cassidy chick, my sister used to like - God forbid - Donny Osmond. So I was not interested in Arabic music as such - it was always long and monotonous. </p> <p>\"But at that village wedding, I thought, 'Gosh, this is good'. These women were not crying, they were not feeling sorry for themselves, they were not the image of a Palestinian woman crying at the grave of her son that you see on the news. They were quite modestly dressed but they were sensuous, flirtatious - mother earth. I'm in love with them. I call them the big mammas.\" </p> <p>These \"big mammas\" are key to the Arabic musical tradition. \"Women are better singers,\" Kelani says. \"They are not ashamed of their feelings, so that makes them better repositories of the oral tradition and therefore better interpreters of it.\"</p> <p>Kelani's influences, evident in her work, are widespread, ranging from English folk music, to Bessie Smith and French singer Barbara, but it is Arabic music, in all its many manifestations, that really runs through her veins.</p> <p>\"The music of the Arabs taught me the connection between folk and classical music, even in the western tradition,\" she says.</p> <p>As such, Kelani has here selected 10 artists or musical genres that both influenced her and serve as an introduction to Arabic music for the uninitiated. </p> <p>\"With all due respect, when people here listen to world music, it is not representative of Arabic music,\" she says. \"Without all of these 10 rivers of influence I would not have been with you today.\"</p> <p><strong>1) <a href=\"http://www.turath.org/Articles/BookRev.htm\">The Music of the Arabs</a>, which accompanies a book by the same name written by Habib Hassan Touma, a Palestinian who came from Nazareth.</strong> Kelani: \"It's not pastiche, it's not world-music, it's not pop: you need to start from the folk and the classical musician to understand Arabic music.\"</p> <p><strong>2) Asmahan, a Syrian princess from the Druze community.</strong> \"In my view the greatest female Arab singer, alongside Umm Kulthoum. Syria is historically one of the purest roots of Arabic music.\" <br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39v0GS4qTwA&amp;feature=related\">Listen to Asmahan sing a traditional Syrian tune</a>.</p> <p><strong>3) Umm Kulthoum, from Egypt.</strong> \"She taught me to include both the sacred and the secular in my repertoire, because she did both. Her performance techniques are also incredible and she taught me how to be able to help generate a state of mind as a performer that helps connect you and the audience. It's what Federico Garcia Lorca wrote about: <em>duende</em> - that minute when everything clicks between you and the performer.\" <br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLmDUk4g7xg&amp;feature=related\">Listen to Kulthoum sing at a concert in Kuwait, 1968</a>.</p> <p><strong>4) Fairouz, a Lebanese Christian singer.</strong> \"She taught me how to combine modernity with being in touch with your ancestral and collective routes. The beauty of Fairouz is that she sang a lot of songs that seemingly sounded more western than Arab, but actually there is a lot of maqaam theory there, combined with modernity.\" <br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVkMrJ_pJZI\">Listen to Fairouz sing about Palestinians wanting to return to their homeland one day.</a></p> <p><strong>5) Lebanese composer Ziad Rahbani, son of Fairouz and composer 'Asi Rahbani.</strong> \"Great innovator, playwright, singer, composer, also worked a lot with jazz elements: my idea of using a jazz rhythm section is inspired by him. He also inspired me to combine jazz with Arabic melodic modes - maqaam - and taught me how to be a social observer. Ziad's music is not just beauty for the sake of beauty, but beauty and content, doing music for a purpose.\" <br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acEb-o9gYRQ&amp;feature=related\">Listen to Rahbani use western and Arabic instruments to play a tribute to Louis Armstrong.</a></p> <p><strong>6) Flamenco singer Camar\u00f3n.</strong> \"He was the master of a style of singing called <em>cante jondo</em> - deep singing - which developed in Spain but originated in Baghdad in 850. Listening to Cameron, although he's Spanish, will connect you with <em>cante jondo</em> and the Qasida style - it's still Arabic.\" <br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sobbzaIa4_E&amp;feature=related\">Listen to the \"question and answer\" performance technique of Camar\u00f3n's <em>cante jondo</em>.</a></p> <p><strong>7) Egyptian composer Sayyid Darwish.</strong> \"His greatest achievement is that he got Arabic music out of the palaces and into the street. His music also had a purpose, he became a social observer, he wrote songs about how Egyptian Muslims, Christians and Jews should unite. Music became not a political weapon but music with content, with purpose.\" <br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xaa9oTZL22o&amp;feature=related\">Listen to a rare recording in Darwish's own voice, made sometime between 1919 and 1923 - it pays tribute to porters and manual workers.</a></p> <p><strong>8) Sudanese singer Muhammad Wardi.</strong> \"Wardi sings in Arabic but he is ethnically Nubian. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEvNDjvOXhw&amp;feature=related\">Here he is singing and playing the Tanbur</a>, a Nubian string instrument that uses the pentatonic scale - like the rest of Africa and in China - which connects to the Blues tradition. So this is still Arabic music but I'm taking you to Africa and to the Mississippi.\"</p> <p><strong>9)<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHha_-I0BF4\">Funoun al-Bahr (Songs of the Sea) by Arabian Gulf pearl fishers.</a></strong> \"Notice the drone in their voices and their swaying movements, meant to resemble the motion of the sea. The clapping with the beat and off-beat pattern is exactly the same style used in Flamenco music.\"</p> <p><strong>10) Sacred Arabic Chant:</strong> a) <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEnqBUdIGc4&amp;feature=related\">the Qur'anic recitation</a> (Sheikh Abdul-Basit Abdul-Samad from Egypt); and b) <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvjiVam2HO4&amp;feature=related\">Eastern Christian Byzantine chant</a>. \"Both of these are vocally, technically quite incredible, and on a spiritual level they are connected.\"</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/PRhardie.htm\">Keir Hardie</a> is Labour's greatest pioneer and its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/19/labour.past\">greatest hero</a>. Without him, the party would never have existed. Without him, Attlee, Bevan and Castle would never have become cabinet ministers. This extraordinary man rose from the pits of Ayrshire to change the world. He became the first Labour MP, the founder of the ILP, first leader of the Labour party, pioneer editor of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Leader\">Labour Leader</a>, and a giant in the socialist movement worldwide. Miraculously, he created a new party, as \"an uprising of the working class\". </p> <p>Hardie was both our greatest strategist and our greatest prophet and evangelist. His vision made the Labour Alliance. He saw that a mass party needed a mass working-class base, the unions from which he himself had sprung. But his ILP also brought in middle-class socialists. Labour should \"blend the classes into one human family\", but always, independently, \"work out its own emancipation\". </p> <p>And he was a unique popular crusader. In Cambridge in 1907 the young Hugh Dalton was deeply moved by Hardie's \"total lack of fear or anger\"; he became a socialist that night. No one more powerfully exposed the cruelties of late-Victorian capitalists like Lord Overtoun's \"white slavery\". Yet Hardie insisted that socialism \"made war upon a system not a class\". Labour should \"capture power, not destroy it\". </p> <p>Hardie attached his party to great issues and values still relevant today. He was the greatest-ever male feminist. Through his friendship with Sylvia Pankhurst, he insisted that women's liberation involved women not just as voters, but as mothers, workers, human beings. He crusaded passionately against poverty: his proud description was \"member for the unemployed\", campaigning for the minimum wage and eliminating child poverty. He pioneered social welfare, advocating a national health service financed from redistributive taxation, not a poll tax. He was a principled democrat. His socialism was not a massive state bureaucracy but the true republican democracy of Milton, including Welsh and Scottish devolution. His global vision linked Labour with colonial freedom. In Bengal in 1907 he outraged the Raj by demanding that India should actually be governed by Indians. I once saw a walking stick in Hardie's Cumnock home, a present from his great admirer, Mahatma Gandhi. In South Africa, Hardie almost uniquely argued that self-government there was for whites only and that in Natal and Cape Colony black Africans' status would seriously erode. And finally, Hardie anchored Britain in the international socialist movement. He was, like Wordsworth in 1789, a citizen of the world. He crusaded with French comrades for international peace. He stood up courageously during the Boer war, denouncing its \"methods of barbarism\". In 1914, he was horrified by that imperialist bloodbath, and it killed him. As George Bernard Shaw movingly wrote, Hardie's indomitable truth would still go marching on. </p> <p>Hardie's greatness is reflected in the simplicity of his lifestyle. You could never imagine him, like Attlee, counting up the number of Etonians in his government nor, like Bevan, quaffing Bollinger with Beaverbrook.

  "<p>The US government's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/09/freddiemacandfanniemae.useconomy\">takeover of mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac</a> constitutes a huge bail-out of these institutions' creditors, whose losses have ballooned as house prices continue to plummet. With the government now fully guaranteeing Fannie's and Freddie's debts, American taxpayers will have to pay for everything not covered by their creditors' inadequate capital.</p> <p>Why are these <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/research/articlesBySubject/displaystory.cfm?subjectid=348876&amp;story_id=12274120\">bail-outs</a> happening in the world's most avowedly capitalist country? Don't venerable capitalist principles imply that anyone who believed in the real estate bubble and who invested in Fannie and Freddie must accept their losses? Is it fair that innocent taxpayers must now pay for their mistakes?</p> <p>The answers to such questions would be obvious if the moral issues in the current financial crisis were clear-cut. But they are not.</p> <p>Most importantly, it is not clear that the bail-out will actually impose any <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2008/09/18/news/economy/bailout_tally_taxpayer/?postversion=2008091814\">net costs on US taxpayers</a>, since it may prevent further systemic effects that bring down the financial sector and, with it, the world economy. Just because systemic effects are difficult to quantify does not mean that they are not real.</p> <p>The bonds issued by Fannie and Freddie were widely thought to carry <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601039&amp;refer=columnist_pauly&amp;sid=a.o3AnmqPqwU\">an implicit US government guarantee</a>. Even though there was no official guarantee, the US government's failure to come to the rescue could destroy confidence in government debt, and, by association, other financial paper as well.</p> <p>The issues go far beyond the US economy. The global economy has been driven in recent years by remarkable speculative asset booms and busts, which bring into the equation questions of confidence and trust, as well as fairness. Similar housing booms in many other countries are now ending, and they may face the pain \u2013 and the moral dilemmas \u2013 that the US economy is <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D938JIRO0.htm\">now experiencing</a>.</p> <p>Moreover, housing markets are not the only issue. So are stock markets. The Shanghai Composite in China rose by a factor of five in real terms from 2005 to 2007, and then lost two-thirds of its real value. The Sensex in India rose by a factor of five in real terms over 2003 to 2007, and has since lost a third of its value. Similar stock market booms and busts have occurred in many other countries.</p> <p>While they lasted, the booms that preceded these busts caused these economies to overheat. Now that the booms have been reversed, a decline in confidence could engulf the world economy, throwing it into recession. To prevent that, some selective bail-outs will likely be needed, not to support the market but to deal with injustices.</p> <p>There is no accurate science of confidence, no way of knowing how people will react to a failure to help when markets collapse. People's reactions to these events depend on their emotions and their sense of justice.</p> <p>The booms and busts have caused great redistributions of wealth. People who bought into the stock market or housing market did either well or poorly, depending on their timing. People will judge the fairness of these outcomes in terms of what they were told, and what kinds of implicit promises they inferred.</p> <p>What were people in all these countries told about the markets in which they invested? Was it all really truthful? Unfortunately, there is no way to find out. Policymakers can provide only general responses, not deal with all cases individually.</p> <p>We do know that recent economic growth in many countries has been spectacular. But were investments in their markets oversold? Did cynical salespeople in these and other countries lead people to believe that the boom times would produce wealth for everyone?</p> <p>To be sure, while there may have been much \"cheap talk\" \u2013 general advice with disclaimers \u2013 most of the losers in this game are not starving. But we cannot blithely conclude that all the losses should be allowed to stand in full force.</p> <p>The gnawing problem is one of \"good faith.\" Economies prosper only on the perception that \"good faith\" exists. The current situation, in which speculative booms have driven the world economy \u2013 and, having collapsed, are now driving it into recession \u2013 suggests that there may have been a lot of bad faith by people promoting certain investments.</p> <p>Consider investors in Fannie and Freddie bonds. While the US government never officially promised to bail them out, it did create a special agency, the <a href=\"http://www.ofheo.gov/\">Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight</a>, which was to assess their strength in an annual report. But this agency never even acknowledged that there was a housing bubble. Government leaders gave no warnings. So can we really say that investors must suffer the full consequences of any losses? How can this be fair?</p> <p>The world is discovering capitalism and its power to transform economies. But capitalism relies on good faith. A perception of unfair treatment can be deadly to economic growth, because it means that people will lose trust in businesses, and hence be less willing to offer to them their precious capital and labour. Is that outcome morally superior to a bail-out?</p> <p><em>In association with <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org/\">Project Syndicate</a>, 2008.</em></p>",
  "<p>I posted the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2008/sep/18/uk\">email from a Telegraph journalist yesterday</a> because, despite my misgivings, I think he/she articulated many complaints I hear, and receive, from journalists who have come into the business in the past decade or so. These are the people who knew just a little of life in newsrooms <strong><em>before</em></strong> the net and are now living through the disruptions caused by the changing culture of multi-platform journalism.</p> <p>Let's get one thing understood right away. All notions that reporting and subbing on national papers was infinitely better/ more professional/ more informative for readers/ journalistically superior to the present day are a form of misguided nostalgia. (See similar comments from both <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2008/sep/18/uk?commentpage=1\">Waltroon</a> and <a href=\"http://www.countervalue.com/2008/09/18/more-from-those-halcyon-telegraph-days/\">Justin Williams</a>). It was undeniably more fun. There was heavy drinking, access to seemingly unlimited cash through expenses (often paid in advance), a relaxed working regime and generous rewards for extra casual work. </p> <p>But those of us who were lucky enough to have lived through it also know that it was not one long party. Some people, especially those who were aiming for promotion, worked very hard indeed. The hours were unsocial and could be long. While some journalists did manage to do little, the work ethic among many more was strong. Perspiration usually scored over inspiration.</p> <p>What I want to stress, in a direct rebuttal of the emailer's contention about matters having changed, is that right from the moment I first stepped into Fleet Street in 1969 the \"levels of commitment - in hours and workload\" were demanding. Most executives did work 70-hour weeks. And, knowing what life was like for those colleagues of mine down the years who were married, I guess it's possible to argue that their working life was \"unsustainable in conjunction with a normal family life\" (though one might ask: what is a normal family life?)</p> <p>The work-hard-play-hard culture began to disintegrate from 1986 onwards, following the Wapping revolution, as owners and managers regained the initiative after some 40 years of trade union domination (and Fleet Street was left behind). Editors were expected to be more \"one of us\" - the management - rather than \"one of them\", the editorial staff. (This was true in both national and regional newspapers incidentally). The 1990-91 recession started a process of rationalisation. Staffing numbers, wages and expenses began to be the subject of continual review. (Note the comment by <strong>jontus</strong>).</p> <p>Then, of course, came the internet and the birth of the digital revolution. The impact of this technological breakthrough was misunderstood at first. Some owners invested heavily, hiring more staff, while others stood back. It seemed, for just a moment, that there were was to be a new boom time for journalists, with one set producing in print and another producing online. </p> <p>Regional owners were among the first to see through this nonsense, realising that journalism was in a transition stage. And the Telegraph were among the first of the national groups to understand its revolutionary import. Multi-platform journalism would, for the foreseeable future, be an imperative. A large, settled audience must be served in print (in order to try to preserve ad revenue). But a growing new audience must be served digitally, on computer or by mobile phone.</p> <p>Yet, and this is the key to understanding the reason for the problems highlighted by the emailer, this revolution has occurred against a background of fast-declining profitability across the whole newspaper industry. In other words, at a time when investment is required to fund innovation, revenues are decreasing. The result? Professional journalists, the people at the word-face, the traditional content-providers, are being expected to do much more than ever before.</p> <p>They are also doing so in the face of a totally new journalistic environment, one in which the audience - a previously passive construct - is becoming much more active through increased participation. Citizen journalism may be in its infancy, and may not yet be a coherent force, but it is clear that it is going to be in future. So career journalists are, as the emailer implied, feeling the squeeze.</p> <p>The changes are certainly disturbing. But is it a reason for pessimism?<br>I am sympathetic to those journalists suffering from depressed salaries (I have not been immune to that, having taken substantial pay cuts in recent years). I do recognise that employers will take, and are taking, liberties. They pay themselves too much and often pay journalists too little. Then again, I also understand that, as companies, they are struggling to survive.</p> <p>But I do not agree that we have reached, or are likely to reach, a stage in which wages make a journalistic career impossible to follow. What is more likely to happen is ever-smaller central staffs - at the hub, to borrow a Telegraph analogy - who will be well rewarded for their essential work.</p> <p>By the way, my emailing friend, I wouldn't knock \"vocation\" as a reason to be a journalist. Idealism, even in this vicious commercial world of ours, is to be celebrated. Anyway, vocational journalism is surely another name for citizen journalism, is it not?</p> <p>I agree that \"facts are no longer the currency they used to be\", which is one reason why views dominate on the web. But I do share with <strong>Waltroon</strong> a worry about maintaining staffs of sufficient quantity and quality to dig up facts that don't sit up and present themselves. Investigative journalism must not be allowed to wither, though I do not see that happening at present.</p> <p>Of course society must be \"equipped to hold the powerful to account\". But, again, there is no sign that we are failing in that task. Indeed, the net opens up avenues for us to explore what the powerful are up to. All is not lost. All will not be lost.</p> <p>Finally, I urge the emailer to see things as they are. I believe in opting in. I am an optimist. I do not believe we're going to hell in a handcart. I love talking about the old days. I enjoy the reminiscences on the <a href=\"http://www.gentlemenranters.com/\">gentlemenranters site</a>, for instance. But they do not persuade me to live in the past. </p>",
  "<p>The boss of Absolute Radio, the rock music station that will rise from the ashes of Virgin Radio on September 29, has set an audience target of 3 million listeners.</p> <p>The station will be free of advertising for its first 24 hours on air, as part of a sponsorship with Sony Ericsson. </p> <p>Donnach O'Driscoll, the Absolute chief executive, said the station would be investing \u00a315m on marketing and content over the first few years.</p> <p>He said the station's previous owner, SMG, had spent just \u00a3180,000 on promoting Christian O'Connell's breakfast show after the DJ joined from London station Xfm four years ago.</p> <p>O'Driscoll was speaking at an event organised by commercial radio representative body, the RadioCentre, in which commercial radio bosses joined forces to outline their vision for the future of the sector. </p> <p>The chief executive of the RadioCentre, Andrew Harrison, said it was a \"once-in-a-lifetime opportunity\" to reinvigorate commercial radio after the big radio groups - Chrysalis Radio, GCap Media, Virgin Radio, and Emap Radio - all went into private hands in the past 12 months.</p> <p>\"This is a new era for our industry. In the last year \u00a31bn of private money has been invested into radio groups and this ownership change provides an ideal opportunity for re-evaluation and revitalising the medium for advertisers.\"</p> <p>Harrison was joined by O'Driscoll, Global Radio chief executive Ashley Tabor and executive director Richard Park, Bauer Radio group managing director Dee Ford, GMG Radio deputy chief executive Stuart Taylor and UTV managing director Scott Taunton. </p> <p>Ford said Bauer remained in talks with Global to buy Birmingham-based BRMB, one of five Global Radio stations that it must sell as part of its deal to buy GCap Media.</p> <p>\"We would like it but it is not life or death,\" said Ford. \"We would not do a deal at any price.\"</p> <p>Earlier at the RadioCentre event in central London, Ford had joked with Global's Tabor: \"Clearly if there are any assets for sale, Ashley, we would like a bit more scale.\"</p> <p>O'Driscoll said he wanted an audience \"in excess of 3 million people\" for Absolute Radio.</p> <p>Virgin Radio had 2.4 million listeners in the second quarter of this year, according to the latest Rajar figures, with another 267,000 listening to its digital station Virgin Radio Classic Rock, and 120,000 tuned into Virgin Radio Extreme.</p> <p>O'Driscoll said he wanted Absolute Radio to be a music and entertainment brand that would be rolled out into Europe and around the world. </p> <p>\"We want to have more Sony award-winning DJs than any other radio station in the country,\" he added. </p> <p>O'Driscoll said the sponsorship deal with Sony Ericsson would allow the new station to launch without the \"clutter\" of regular advert breaks between records. \"It is an area we would like to investigate more in the future.\"</p> <p><em><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857.

  "<p>Gordon Brown urged MPs to \"restate the case for our party and our values\" today in a letter to parliamentary colleagues ahead of this weekend's crucial party conference.</p> <p>The prime minister sought to concentrate party minds on a political fightback by promoting Labour's core values amid growing calls for a leadership contest from within the party. </p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/19/gordonbrown.labour1\">the letter</a>, the prime minister outlined the measures being taken by the party to help people through \"this turbulent economic time\".</p> <p>This will be mirrored in the conference slogan, \"Winning the fight for Britain's future\", which will adorn the backdrop to Brown's keynote speech to the party on Tuesday, a Labour spokesman revealed today.</p> <p>The premier told MPs to \"restate the case for our party and values\" and said he was confident \"we can come through this difficult time\".</p> <p>Brown said the party needed to demonstrate that the choice at the next election would be between \"a Conservative party which still believes in helping the few and not the many and a Labour party which believes in fairness and opportunity for all and has the policies to deliver them\".</p> <p>But he faces an uphill struggle as he seeks to rally the parliamentary party, many of whom are demoralised by Labour's performance over recent months. </p> <p>An online survey of rank and file Labour activists <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/exclusive-now-the-grassroots-turn-against-brown-935400.html\">conducted by Labourhome for the Independent</a>, published today, found 57% believe there should be a vote at the Manchester party conference to decide whether Brown should face a leadership election. </p> <p>A majority (54%) would prefer someone else to lead the party into the next general election, while 45% of respondents said switching leader would boost their prospects at the next general election. Only 28% thought a change of leader would make things worse. </p> <p>Brown's personal rating in the poll ranked lower than every member of the cabinet, except chief whip Geoff Hoon and the transport secretary, Ruth Kelly.</p> <p>Favourites to replace Brown were foreign secretary David Miliband (24.6%), followed by health secretary Alan Johnson (18.1%), backbench MP Jon Cruddas (11.3%) and justice secretary Jack Straw (9.6%).</p> <p>The deputy leader, Harriet Harman, lagged behind on (6.6%).</p> <p>The results of the poll, which comprised 788 Labour members and supporters, will be a further blow to Brown, just a day after a separate poll by Ipsos Mori yesterday put Labour on just 24%, a massive 28 points behind the Tories, whose 52% rating was their best score since the heyday of Margaret Thatcher.</p> <p>Brown took a defiant tone in a pre-broadcast Sky News interview, due to be screened tonight. He said he would not be forced out by rebels and warned the party \"this is not the time for faint hearts\". He added: \"This is the time for people who know how to deal with difficult economic circumstances.\"</p> <p>He published a policy document yesterday setting out the priorities for Manchester, including assistance for elderly people who go into care.</p> <p>The paper acknowledged that the current system - which forces thousands of people to sell their homes to pay for social care - was \"unfair and unsustainable\" and promised change.</p> <p>It is thought likely that the reforms will include a drive to help older people stay in their own homes for longer, rather than going into care. But ministers are expected to continue to rule out state funding of the full cost of social care.</p> <p>Former cabinet minister Alan Milburn warned that the party must embrace \"change\" to win back the public.</p> <p>In comments likely to be taken as tacit support for rebels who want to depose Brown, the arch-Blairite said: \"One of New Labour's key strengths has been its preparedness to face the future challenge rather than taking comfort in the past achievement.</p> <p>\"The willingness to change is what has made New Labour so dominant in British politics and forced even our most strident opponents into contemplating changes they once thought abhorrent. Now change beckons once again.\"</p> <p>Harman last night rounded on colleagues braying for a leadership election, claiming they have made an \"error of judgment\".</p> <p>She told BBC One's Question Time an internal contest would be \"completely wrong\" when people were so concerned about their jobs and finances.</p> <p>Harman said: \"I think if people are worried about their job or worried about their savings, the idea that we say our priority is to have an internal leadership election, I think people would think that was completely wrong.</p> <p>\"So I know what they're saying and I think that they are making an error of judgment. I don't think there is going to be a leadership election, I don't think there should be a leadership election.\"</p> <p>She refused to be drawn on whether she would stand in an election, claiming it was a \"hypothetical\" leadership election she did not believe in. </p> <p>\"I don't want any of my colleagues to have to start engaging in discussion about a hypothetical leadership election which is not going to happen, so I'm not going to start.\"</p> <p>Jon Cruddas, who came third in the deputy leadership election last year, today rebuked Blairites seeking to topple Brown. </p> <p>The MP for Daggenham told the Times that none of those who claim to be Tony Blair's allies come close to matching the former leader. He told the paper: \"People will be watching with wide open eyes unable to undestand that... we should become preoccupied with electing another leader. That's what's so wrong.\" </p> <p>He admitted that Brown's electoral prospects \"don't look good\" but warned that a leadership election could leave the party in a worse position by entrenching divisions.</p> <p>Meanwhile, former deputy prime minister John Prescott issued a call for party unity, saying: \"The public is listening to Labour - all it hears it talking about is leadership.</p> <p>\"For God's sake, they are worried about their jobs, they are worried about the future. They want somebody who can handle global problems, and Gordon Brown is that man.\"</p>",

  "<p>So, antisemitism and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/18/islam.religion\">Islamophobia</a> are on the rise in Europe \u2013 according to the <a href=\"http://pewglobal.org/reports/pdf/262.pdf\">Pew survey (pdf)</a> of global attitudes, just released. Reading below the headlines produces a mixture of good news, sort-of-good news and bad news.</p> <p>The good news is that such prejudice comes from the usual suspects: those over 50 (more set in their thinking and born in the days before pluralism became an accepted concept), as well as those with lower levels of education. Moreover, the two tendencies are linked: people who are antisemitic are likely to be Islamophobes, implying that it is a gut dislike of those perceived to be \"different\" rather than a new political ideology.</p> <p>The sort-of-good news is that Britain stands out as the one country in Europe where such prejudices have not been on the increase. Yes, we have had occasional hiccups in each of the last three decades (riots in Liverpool, Bristol and Bradford), but by and large we are a remarkably tolerant society.</p> <p>No one bats and eyelid anymore at the sight of a mixed-race couple pushing a pram in the high street. The England cricket team was recently captained by <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/3753877.stm\">Nasser Hussain</a> (50 years ago that would have been impossible and even 30 years ago he might have changed his name to Nigel Hawkins to seem more acceptable). The last leader of the Conservative party, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3224341.stm\">Michael Howard</a>, was Jewish and still rose to the top of that bastion of tradition.</p> <p>Of course, the bad news is that despite the efforts of liberal politicians, the interfaith initiatives of religious leaders, and multicultural studies in schools, there is still much resistance to the message of tolerance and acceptance.</p> <p>Perhaps it is natural to the human condition to define ourselves according categories of \"us and them\", \"friend or foe\", but like so many other selfish or destructive instincts, we just have to keep going until we educate them away. Moral evolution is an ongoing process.</p> <p>The best strategy is zero tolerance and cracking down on even mild prejudice, be it in the classroom, office or on the street. Unpleasant words and demeaning jokes create negative atmospheres, and failure to act against them decisively allows them to grow and gain respectability. Eventually that leads to physical attacks by ignorant louts or the accession to political platforms by clever louts.</p> <p>At the same time, ethnic and religious minorities must not score own goals by retreating from society at large and erecting barriers that then reinforce stereotypes about them.</p> <p>It is a delicate balance \u2013 integrating without assimilating, <br>opting in without selling out, maintaining distinctiveness without isolating oneself, welcoming without overwhelming. Sometimes it means juggling with compromises and living with inconsistencies.</p> <p>What we need is a package of measures \u2013 based on moral rectitude by majorities and sensitive coexistence by minorities \u2013 as well as the reverse. It is a struggle worth pursuing even though completing it seems to be taking so long.</p>",

  "<p>Taro Aso, who is likely to be installed as Japan's new prime minister next week, today refused to acknowledge the use of hundreds of allied prisoners of war by his family's coal mining business during the second world war.</p> <p>Aso, a former foreign minister who is widely expected to be elected leader of the ruling Liberal Democratic party [LDP] on Monday, would not comment directly on Aso Mining's use of an estimated 10,000 Korean forced labourers and 300 allied POWs at its Yoshikuma pit in Kyushu, south-western Japan.</p> <p>\"I was only five years old when the war ended so I honestly have no personal recollection of that time,\" Aso, 67, told reporters in Tokyo.</p> <p>Aso, who served as president of an Aso Mining's successor, Aso Cement, from 1973 to 1979, added: \"Aso Cement was a separate company, so I have never regarded this as an issue.</p> <p>\"My responsibility as a politician has been to help rebuild postwar Japan and turn it into a responsible member of the international community.\"</p> <p>His comments are likely to anger surviving POWs, who have never received an apology or compensation from the firm, despite evidence unearthed by historians that they were made to work underground for up to 15 hours a day, seven days a week, without pay.</p> <p>In a document submitted on the orders of the occupation authorities on January 24 1946, Aso Mining admitted it had employed 300 POWs - 101 British, 197 Australian and two Dutch - from May 1945 until the end of the war, but said they had received wages and been fairly treated.</p> <p>Since then the company, which was run during the war by Aso's father, Takakichi, has never publicly acknowledged the use of POW labourers, and a 100-year history of the company published in1975 makes no mention of them.</p> <p>\"Aso's refusal to acknowledge his family's use of slave labour proves just how out of step Japan is with the global trend towards recognising historical wrongs and making reparations,\" William Underwood, an expert on forced labour in wartime Japan, told the Guardian.</p> <p>The domestic media routinely ignores Aso's family connections to wartime slave labour. The firm, now called the Aso Group, is run by Aso's younger brother, Yutaka. In 2001 it entered a joint venture with the French firm Lafarge Cement.</p> <p>\"If this had happened in any country except Japan there would be a domestic consciousness of the problem,\" Underwood said.</p> <p>\"Aso repeatedly says he has no personal recollection of the war's end, but he was president of the successor to Aso Mining. He has airbrushed the POWs out of history. Where is the corporate social responsibility?\"</p> <p>Aso, a rightwing populist, is expected to win a landslide victory when LDP MPs and local chapters members choose a new leader on Monday. The winner is practically assured of becoming prime minister when the LDP-dominated lower house resumes two days later.</p>",

By any measure we generated that buzz, that curiosity, that interest.\"</p> <p>Ad agency Crispin Porter &amp; Bogusky is thought to have one more Gates/Seinfeld ad made, however it is not known if the commercial will ever see the light of day.</p> <p>Veghte said that the new TV campaign, which has been supported in the US by full page newspaper ads with the strapline \"Windows vs Walls\", enabled Microsoft to \"have the conversation 'what is Windows?'\".</p> <p>He admitted that the market dominance of Microsoft's Windows product had caused the company to lose touch emotionally with consumers.</p> <p>\"Windows is incredibly ubiquitous yet because of that ubiquity it's become so practical that some of that magic, that emotional connection, has been lost,\" he said. \"We haven't had a conversation in the marketplace for a long time around Windows\".</p> <p><em><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediaguardian.co.uk\">editor@mediaguardian.co.uk</a> or phone 020 7239 9857.

  "<p>Gordon Brown's reputation for handling big issues is already under fire. Whitehall sources talk of a black hole at Number 10 where policy making should be. But a recent example of a more personal nature affecting the handling of a complaint from a voter suggests that Downing Street may be more dysfunctional than we realise.</p> <p>Tracy Cross is a 47-year-old, seriously disabled worker who lost a worthwhile job with state employer Remploy, checking decontamination suits for the police and rescue services for any minute holes.</p> <p>She was one of thousands who lost their jobs when the government decided to close 30 Remploy factories employing exclusively disabled people earlier this year, something that Thatcher even at the height of privatisation left untouched.</p> <p>Last year she met Brown in Birmingham when her union, the GMB, were campaigning to stop the factory closures, including her own in York. Her union even made a <a href=\"http://www.gmb.org.uk/Templates/Internal.asp?NodeID=96716\">film about her</a>. But the closure went ahead. Her father, Geoff, a pensioner in his 70s, wrote to Number Ten to protest last April. Three months, later Brown replied.</p> <p>His three-page letter was written in good intent and personalised. He had been told a month earlier by Remploy that Tracy had found a placement in a York charity shop run by Age Concern. \"I trust you are pleased about this and I would like to wish her the very best for her new job, I understand Tracy is enjoying the work she is doing and the support she is receiving in her new environment.\"</p> <p>The PM was completely wrong. Tracy was not enjoying her work. She had been sacked four weeks ago. Downing Street had never checked back with Remploy before sending the letter.</p> <p>Her father was apoplectic. \"It is no wonder that your standing and that of the party is falling when you are surrounded by totally incompetent advisers.. day and night we have to comfort her and try to be positive but it is very hard for a person suffering from dyspraxia to understand the situation.\"</p> <p>Downing Street has told the Guardian: \"We regret any distress this may have caused. The prime minister will be writing to Mr Cross again shortly. He has also asked Anne McGuire, minister for disabled people, to look in detail at Tracey's case.\" </p> <p>To me this illustrates what is going wrong with Labour. The GMB union are not surprised about what has happened. Phil Davies, the organiser of the Remploy campaign, has told ministers repeatedly that Remploy factories are specially adapted places where severely disabled people can be given full support so they can make a useful contribution to society by working. Age Concern tells me they had to let Tracy go because they could not give her the specialist one-to-one support she needed in the charity shop.</p> <p>Gordon Brown never listened to these people. No wonder he is the most unpopular PM since Neville Chamberlain.</p>",
  "<p>Republican presidential candidate John McCain and his campaign are drawing criticism for not telling the truth. It's gotten so bad that <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1842030,00.html\">the media</a>, politicians, and <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/s//afp/20080908/ts_afp/usvote_080908234500\">Barack Obama </a>have unleashed a new L-word \u2013 lie \u2013 to describe the state of the stump. Even George Bush's low-blow specialist Karl Rove, mentor to chief McCain campaign strategist Steve Schmidt, <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/09/14/campaign.wrap/\">declared</a> the campaign has \"gone too far\". </p> <p>Barack Obama and his camp are <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/elections-2008/school_funding_misleads.html\">being called for their fibs</a> as well, but McCain is catching more heat, and deservedly so. The McCain-Palin advertisments feature <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/elections-2008/there_he_goes_again.html\">more lies</a> and <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/elections-2008/off_base_on_sex_ed.html\">bigger lies</a> than the Obama side. McCain and company <a href=\"http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2008/09/13/1394679.aspx\">persist in telling lies</a> even after they've been called on them.</p> <p>\"Obama will raise your taxes\" is true when McCain says it to his millionaire wife, but not to the 97% of Americans earning <a href=\"http://www.suntimes.com/news/politics/obama/1150162,tax090708.article\">less than $250,000 a year</a>.</p> <p>\"I told Congress 'thanks but no thanks' on that bridge to nowhere,\" Palin continues to repeat, long after the record has been reviewed to show <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122090791901411709.html?mod=googlenews_wsj\">she initially supported the bridge and that Congress killed it before she did</a>. Moreover, Alaska got those pork barrel funds anyway to finance other projects. </p> <p>It's no surprise that the McCain campaign keeps telling lies. In the movie <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077975/\">Animal House</a>, one of the Delta fraternity pledges is entrusted to care for his big brother's Cadillac. After the fraternity boys ruin the car, one frat boy proposes hiding the wreck, reporting the car stolen, and letting his brother collect the insurance for a replacement. \"Do you think it'll work?\" the pledge asks. </p> <p>His fraternity brother replies, \"It's bound to work better than the truth.\" </p> <p>That's the McCain campaign's central thesis. McCain has supported President Bush \u2013 a president with an approval rating <a href=\"http://pollster.com/polls/us/jobapproval-bush.php\">below 30%</a> - <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/askfactcheck/is_it_true_john_mccain_voted_with.html\">90% of the time</a>. Do the math: that doesn't offer much hope of winning on the facts. So his campaign brews distractions to sidestep real issues. \"This campaign is not about issues,\" campaign manager Rick Davis <a href=\"http://voices.washingtonpost.com/thefix/2008/09/mccain_manager_this_election_i.html\">declared</a>.</p> <p>Many find it particularly hypocritical that McCain, who founded his reputation on straight talk, has resorted to lies, distortions and doubletalk. Some say he's sold his soul for a last grasp at the presidency. But maybe - just maybe - we've got McCain wrong. Maybe the lies are not calculated to misrepresent his record or Obama's. Maybe they're part of a larger strategy. </p> <p>Maybe McCain is really chasing a vast bloc of voters that candidates usual ignore, at least explicitly. In this tight race, the outcome could come down to America's vast hypocrite vote. </p> <p>For example, the 26% of Americans that describe themselves as evangelical Christians have strong hypocritical tendencies, politically at least. Evangelicals first became a political force in the 1980 presidential election, when they abandoned small town Sunday school teacher and born-again Christian Jimmy Carter for divorced, Hollywood actor and infrequent churchgoer Ronald Reagan.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://pewresearch.org/pubs/743/united-states-religion\">Pew Research survey</a> released early this year found that evangelicals are nearly as likely to be living together out of wedlock as the public at large and more likely to be divorced. Perhaps more telling, the Barna Group <a href=\"http://www.barna.org/FlexPage.aspx?Page=BarnaUpdate&amp;BarnaUpdateID=263\">found that</a> only about one in five self-proclaimed evangelicals actually hold the tradition's key core beliefs. Underscoring that point, evangelicals have loudly applauded Bristol Palin, the 17-year-old pregnant daughter of the Republican vice presidential candidate, as a goddess of life rather than condemn her as a sinner. One suspects they wouldn't be quite so forgiving if it was an Obama offspring was the mother-to-be \u2013 or the shotgun groom. </p> <p>But hypocrisy cuts across religious as well as party lines. Tens of millions of Americans talk the talk but don't walk the walk or think things through. They drive their SUVs to Earth Day rallies. They watch Fox News and parrot complaints about the media's liberal bias. They believe America needs to keep good, high wage jobs at home yet shop at Wal-Mart, Chinese exporters' best customer. They don't see a contradiction or even a connection between abstinence-only sex education and pregnancy crisis centres.</p> <p>For them, McCain offers not just a hypocritical campaign, but a hypocritical agenda for the White House. After 26 years on Capitol Hill, President McCain will reform Washington and put the lobbyists who run his campaign out of business. He'll cut taxes, yet balance the budget. He'll reduce regulation yet bring order to Wall Street. He'll continue the American war in Iraq to victory, even though there's little sign of political progress among Iraqi factions despite the decrease in violence. He'll stop global warming while providing bigger fixes to satisfy America's addiction to oil.</p> <p>In short, McCain will keep doing what Bush has done, but, he says, the results will be different. That's not just hypocritical. That's insane.</p>",
  "<p>It's been dubbed Germany's dumbest bank for handing over \u20ac350m (\u00a3275m) to Lehman Brothers two hours before the American investment bank collapsed.</p> <p>Now, two board members and the head of risk control at KfW, the state-owned bank, have been suspended for the \"inexcusable error\".</p> <p>The automated transfer, which with other deals cost KfW more than \u20ac530m, was a one-way swap: the bank got nothing back just as its rivals were taking their dollars out of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/lehmanbrothers\">Lehmans</a> as fast as they could.</p> <p>German ministers have spent the week loftily telling the global financial community their banks were immune from the toxic rot at the core of the US financial system.</p> <p>But now an enraged and embarrassed Peer Steinbrueck, the finance minister and KfW supervisory board member, is threatening wider consequences after clear evidence that \"risk management is not intact\" at the bank. He, for one, knew that Lehmans was going under throughout last weekend.</p> <p>Ulrich Schroeder, KfW's chief executive, is being lined up for the chop after the suspension of Detlef Leinberger and Peter Fleischer. Other directors could soon be clearing their desks too. The German public is in uproar.</p> <p>Steinbrueck's colleague Michael Glos, the economy minister, has started an investigation into processes at the bank, which is 80% owned by the government. The rest belongs to Germany's federal states.</p> <p>Set up after the second world war to help reconstruct a ruined Germany, KfW normally makes loans to small and medium-sized firms but appears to have got involved - like other state-owned banks such as Sachsen LB - in financial trading way beyond its remit.</p> <p>It's not the first time KfW has been caught out by the ripple effects of financial meltdown. Steinbrueck et al forced it to take over IKB, Germany's first casualty of the sub-prime crisis, when the SME lender nearly collapsed a year ago.</p> <p>Eventually, KfW took over 90.8% of IKB and lost its chief executive, a prominent social democrat politician, who quit due to the stress. Last night, its board approved the bargain basement sale of IKB to Lone Star - a Texas-based private equity group clearly no longer regarded as a \"locust\".</p> <p>\"The IKB chapter is closed,\" said Glos. The KfW chapter has, obviously, just begun.</p>",
  "<p>The cliche, currently in vogue, to describe events in our times as \"<a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/blogs/2008/08/the-return-of-history-kagan-fukuyama-and-chinese-exceptionalism/\">the return of history</a>\" is a staggering example of western arrogance. Taken literally, it means everything that took place in the 1990s was not history: the tragic breakup of multinational states, accompanied by civil wars and millions of broken lives; the massacre in Rwanda; the triumph of obscurantism in Afghanistan and the religious and political rise of the developing world; the bombings of Belgrade and Baghdad; nuclear proliferation; and so on. But of course, \"history\" is made only in the Euro-Atlantic space, whereas everything else is part of a fringe world.</p> <p>When the west scored an unexpected victory in its confrontation with the Soviet Union, it, like Dr Faust, wanted a moment to last forever and declared the end of history. But, as in Goethe's tragedy, this feeling proved, in fact, to be a demonic temptation. This is not \"the return of history,\" which actually never went away, but a specific problem of whether the US retains the global leadership it received after the Cold War.</p> <p>US foreign policy traditionally embraces a messianic approach; in image, guided not by selfish national interests but by ideas of freedom and democracy shaped since the its very first days. In the 20th century, this image was further corroborated during the two world wars when America came to Europe's rescue to save it from another catastrophe.</p> <p>After the Soviet Union ceased to exist, America for the first time in history had a taste of global domination, and September 11 gave a boost to the creation of an integral military-ideological strategy. Never before had measures to ensure the security of one country been global in nature. Washington raised the prospect of building a world order that would never again pose a threat to the US.</p> <p>By proliferating democracy around the world, the US could ensure its own military, economic and energy security. Thus ideology merged with geostrategic tasks. Democracy turned into an instrument. The pompous words about freedom and human rights quickly began to lose any sense.</p> <p>However, by the time America formed a comprehensive view on global leadership, it could no longer act regardless of what others might think. International influence began to shift to Asia; Russia recovered from its geopolitical knockout; and even US allies began to express doubts.</p> <p>The hegemon's trap is that the leader has no right to retreat even on minor issues. The inability to uphold one's positions in a peripheral region may have a domino effect. \"Swaps\" with other actors are not provided for, as the global leader has no minor interests that it could waive.</p> <p>As a result, for example, the desire of a strengthened Russia to discuss spheres of interests and even its readiness to make concessions on some issues runs against the US's categorical unwillingness to move. When George Bush and <a href=\"http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20080701faessay87401-p0/condoleezza-rice/rethinking-the-national-interest.html\">Condoleezza Rice</a> speak about the inadmissibility of a policy for delimiting spheres of influence, they mean it. From their point of view, there is only one sphere of influence \u2013 the American one, which embraces the whole world.</p> <p>Therefore, the growth of the ambitions of any country poses a threat to America, which it must neutralise. This may be the build-up of China's economic might; Europe's feeble attempts to formulate an independent political identity; or Russia's desire to restore its position in Eurasia.</p> <p>Of course, threats are not necessarily neutralised by force; this can be done by means of a new system of interaction. But practice shows that force is given preference here. The reanimation of the factor of military force in world politics and the degradation of all international institutions, ranging from the UN and the IMF to Nato and the <a href=\"http://www.osce.org/\">Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe</a>, are the fruits of America's leadership.</p> <p>It would not be fair to blame the US alone for this, as all these organisations are the legacy of the previous epoch. They should have passed into history together with it and given way to something else. However, the \"new world order\" proposed by the cold war winners provided not for the creation of new structures but for the extension of the former western organisations to the whole world. But these organisations proved to be unfit for global functions.</p> <p>Discussions in the west pivot on one idea \u2013 how to ensure western leadership in the new conditions. A global \"concert of powers\", which would provide for the equal participation of all influential actors in the formulation of new rules of the game, is not even discussed. The best they are offered is to discuss terms on which they would recognise the west's supremacy and benefit from that.</p> <p>The return of the US from the hyperpower category into the ranks of great powers, which have a very great, yet not dominant influence on international relations, would be a step towards the restoration of balance in the world. This would require from Washington the formulation of its own national interests and the development of a system of priorities. However, attempts to retain hegemony at any cost, amidst institutional chaos, imbalance of power and the growing ambitions of other countries, would bring about new and increasingly dangerous conflicts.</p>",
  "<p>Russia's two main stockmarkets bounced back dramatically this morning after trading resumed today for the first time since Wednesday, but amid strong signs of continuing volatility.</p> <p>Russia's rouble-denominated MICEX and dollar-denominated RTS reopened after their suspension two days ago \u2013 only to shut again for an hour as shares soared. The exchanges re-opened at midday Moscow time.</p> <p>Regulators sought today's temporary closure after share rises jumped above 15%. By this afternoon the MICEK was up 23.1% on the day, while the RTS had risen 15.5%.</p> <p>The sudden revival of Russian markets, which coincided with shares rallying strongly on Wall Street and in London, came after the Kremlin pumped nearly $60bn (\u00a333bn) into money markets. <br> Russia's finance ministry announced on Wednesday it was lending $44bn to the country's three main banks, while the central bank announced loans of $14bn designed to ease the acute liquidity crisis.</p> <p>This morning the Russian prime minister, Vladimir Putin, said that the economy remained healthy. Speaking at an investors' forum in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, he said that \"fundamental indicators' including Russia's foreign debt surplus were in line with \"the norm\". </p> <p>\"Our response to problems that emerge will be market-orientated. The government and the central bank have sufficient reserves to defend the currency and the financial system,\" Putin declared. Other Kremlin officials made clear the Russian government was prepared to intervene in the crisis.</p> <p>Russia's market has performed worse than any other emerging market this year \u2013 falling some $680bn since its all-time high in May. On Tuesday the MICEX dropped by 17% \u2013 its biggest slide since Russia's 1998 financial crash.</p> <p>Russia's economy is these days integrated into global markets, and has suffered as shares have fallen this week around the world. But the slump in Russia has been particularly acute because of falling oil prices. There has also been a huge flight of capital from Russia since last month's war in Georgia, with foreign investors taking out $35bn.</p>",

  "<p>The European commission broke its promise to improve the protection of animals used in research once again this week when it pulled out of publishing its proposal for the revision of 20-year-old animal testing rules. </p> <p>Directive 86/609/EEC on the protection of animals used in experiments has power of life and death over animals used in European laboratories. Its revision is a once-in-a-generation chance to lead progress away from animal experimentation and towards more reliable, humane alternatives.</p> <p>The process of revising the directive began nearly six years ago, when a specially commissioned <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/environment/chemicals/lab_animals/pdf/evans_report.pdf\"> report (pdf)</a> by the EC environment directive stated that: \"It has come to light that there are several shortcomings in the way that animals are being cared for while subject to experimentation. Although voluntary guidelines exist on the education and training of persons working with laboratory animals, there is currently no EU-wide standard course that can be followed. A recent report compiled by the <a href=\"http://www.buav.org/\">British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection</a> based on an<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sgkgwfahfiw\"> undercover investigation</a> on Cambridge University that revealed a catalogue of animal suffering. That this could happen in the country which is often cited as having the most stringent welfare legislation is lamentable evidence of the shortcomings of the way in which Directive 86/609 is implemented and enforced.\"</p> <p>Despite recognition of such suffering, and the subsequent acknowledgment that urgent action is needed, the commission has repeatedly delayed the adoption of its proposal. It publicly announced last Friday that the proposal would be adopted this week. However, during the two working days between the announcement and scheduled adoption, the item was removed from the official agenda.</p> <p>Over 12 million animals are used in <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/environment/chemicals/lab_animals/reports_en.htm\">experiments in Europe every year</a>, and the numbers are continuing to rise. The commission clearly agrees the existing directive is failing to protect animals and is not bringing about a reduction in their use. In the 21st century, Europe has a responsibility to do better, especially as its citizens have clearly expressed their concern and strongly support the need for change.</p> <p>The majority of people in the UK want to live in a world where nobody wants or believes we need to experiment on animals, according to an independent survey carried out by research group <a href=\"http://www.nfpsynergy.com\">NFP Synergy</a> on behalf of the BUAV. Meanwhile, in one of the largest ever responses, to a commission public consultation the majority said they felt more needed to be done to replace the use of animals and that the budget to find and regulate alternatives must be vastly increased.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.eceae.org\">The European Coalition to End Animal Experiments (ECEAE)</a> \u2013 a coalition of animal protection groups across the EU of which BUAV is a member and of which I am chief executive \u2013 has worked hard to persuade MEPs and other European decision-makers that the time is right for an ambitious and humane new law that begins to fundamentally change the way animals are used in research in the European Union.</p> <p>Following the latest setback the ECEAE has this week written to commissioner Dimas expressing its concern and deep disappointment that the process has yet again been delayed. We are calling for the commission to confirm that the proposed revision of the directive will be adopted and published immediately. It is now crucial that concerned MEPs follow Green <a href=\"http://www.carolinelucasmep.org.uk/2008/09/17/euro-commission-decision-%e2%80%98will-block-better-animal-protection-standards%e2%80%99-warns-green-mep\">Caroline Lucas's</a> example and also put pressure on the commission to publish \u2013 the BUAV and its sister organisations across Europe stand ready to assist MEPs and others who want to take such action.</p> <p>It is widely expected the proposals will include measures to ban the use of wild-caught primates and great apes in experiments, responding to public concern and formalising the position across the EU where the use of our closest living relatives has already been phased out. If the new law is to be fit for the 21st century, however, it must absolutely emphasise the replacement of all animals as a primary moral imperative. This must be secured through binding and mandatory targets to reducing animal use and finding and using humane alternatives. </p> <p>Good intentions are not enough. The change EU citizens wish to see will only come from a transparent system which, as a bare minimum, strongly interrogates the benefit the research is expected to deliver against the suffering caused to the animals involved, and then lays such decision-making open to public scrutiny. </p> <p>It is imperative that European institutions reflect the views of citizens by enshrining in law the principle that research using live animals, no longer has a place in a civilised 21st century Europe. Animals have suffered in EU labs without real protection for long enough. Everyone acknowledges that change is long overdue, EU citizens expect, need and deserve more modern humane research. The time to legislate is now.</p> <p><em>Michelle Thew is the chief executive of the European Coalition to End Animal Experiments, a coalition of animal protection groups across Europe.</em></p>",
  "<p>Earlier this year a group of students from Dubai and South Korea found themselves hovering over a series of platforms suspended over a tranquil sea. When they saw some friends they wanted to talk to in English they landed and started to pick up on conversations and ask questions. These encounters were not taking place in a dream but were part of an innovative language exchange project in the virtual, online world of <a href=\"http://secondlife.com/\">Second Life</a>.</p> <p>Second Life is a 3D computer- generated world that spreads over tens of thousands of virtual square kilo metres. This territory is being explored, built on and lived in by up to 15 million users. What began in 2003 as an experiment in online social networking in which users create a virtual alter ego \u2013 or 3D avatar \u2013 has given life to a society and economy that has made virtual millionaires out of some. It has also attracted the interest of real-world big business.</p> <p>Second Life users can speak and listen to each other via their computer-controlled avatars. The potential for language learning was spotted very early on. What started with informal meetings between users to offer practice in each other's languages has developed into established language courses, taught by avatar instructors, while virtual versions of real-world educational institutions have opened their doors to students.</p> <p>Last April the <a href=\"http://dwc.hct.ac.ae/dwcweb/index.php\">Dubai Women's College</a> (DWC), a leading Gulf state higher education institution, opened a version of its campus on Second Life. Among the first users were second-year students led by their English language teacher, Nicole Shammas. The language exchange that resulted has convinced Shammas and her colleagues that introducing students to a virtual world can be rewarding.</p> <p>Shammas is from New Zealand and has been providing language support to DWC's students, who are taught in English, for a decade. She admits that she was a novice in e-learning when the opportunity to use the Second Life campus came up. Her aim was to develop the communication skills of her students who were mostly from conservative family backgrounds and needed English language skills to operate in a global business environment.</p> <p>Shammas had contacts in South Korea and she was introduced to Chris Surridge, a Canadian, who was doing similar English-language support teaching at the prestigious <a href=\"http://www.kaist.edu/edu.html\">Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology</a> (Kaist) in Seoul. Surridge had been using computer-assisted language learning resources for more than a decade and his students were already highly digitally literate. But like the DWA class, they needed to develop their English.</p> <p>The pair started to pool their ideas and came up with a curriculum that would develop not just English and IT skills but \"soft skills\" such as teamwork and leadership.</p> <p>They agreed that the culmination of the project would be interaction on Second Life, but for that meeting to be successful they had to develop the two groups' interest in each other. Their solution was to develop contact over seven weeks, starting with the exchange of recordings of students posing and answering questions about each other. Next they made short videos about their respective campuses and lives. They then sent each other \"culture capsules\" that contained everyday items and arranged to open them together while they were linked via a video conference. Only then did they meet up in a private area of the DWC Second Life campus.</p> <p>\"It was essential at every point that we had strong motivation for each stage of the programme,\" says Surridge. \"Before students recorded their questions for the first stage, for example, they brainstormed.\"</p> <p>When the students met via the video link to open their capsules, they had practised introductions and questions. Shammas's students had sent a traditional Gulf headdress and explained to the Kaist students how to tie it. \"Chris and I pushed the conversation along, but trying on the dishdasha via video link got everyone involved and the conversation was really student-led,\" says Shammas.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Shammas had been preparing her group for Second Life by identifying students who already knew how to create an avatar and move around, and asking them to act as trainers. They then explored and discussed the social behaviour in Second Life's multicultural environment and the language they would need to deal with it. In groups they sought out locations where they were safe from harassment and put their avatars through their paces by learning new skills such as skiing.</p> <p>\"It was interesting for me to see how the 'first life' values and beliefs of these 19-to-20-year-old Muslim women transferred \u2013 or didn't \u2013 into their Second Life,\" says Shammas.</p> <p>\"All my students wear the veil, yet all chose not to in Second Life. My students don't talk to men they don't know, and this was something that carried over on to Second Life. When they were approached by a stranger they politely declined to talk. With the Korean students they were a lot more open but many preferred interacting in groups rather than one-on-one.\"</p> <p>The final stage was a week-long meeting between the two groups in Second Life. Shammas and Surridge had decided to keep the communication text-based but encouraged the students to be as conversational as possible. The teachers observed the meetings and recorded transcripts, which they intended to analyse in the classroom later.</p> <p>\"By the time we met in Second Life our students were highly motivated to meet and very curious about each other,\" says Shammas.</p> <p>Achieving that motivation while using a range of technology was a mark of the project's success, adds Surridge. \"When I see my students eagerly logging in to check their audio forum messages or frantically typing to keep up with a chat session, I know that we are doing something genuine and meaningful,\" he says.</p> <p>Next month the two teachers are going to repeat the exercise with new groups of students, this time using voice communication when they meet in Second Life.</p> <p>\u2022 To learn more about the International Virtual Exchange project <a href=\"mailto:nicole.shammas@hct.ac.ae\">contact Nicole Shammas</a>.</p>"
