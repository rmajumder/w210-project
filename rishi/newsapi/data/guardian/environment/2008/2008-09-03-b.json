It could cost up to \u20ac20bn (\u00a316bn) to install.</p> <p>The proposed 3,850 mile offshore grid would connect more than 100 wind farms, containing 10,000 turbines, to seven North Sea countries - Britain, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Norway.</p> <p>Senior EC energy officials yesterday gave a warm but guarded welcome to the plans, which were submitted by eco-campaigners Greenpeace and drawn up by environment consultants 3E, calling them \"ambitious but realistic\".</p> <p>The EU is committed to cutting greenhouse gases by 20%, producing 20% of primary energy from renewables and reducing energy consumption by 20% - the so-called 20/20/20 package - by 2020. </p> <p>The plans, on the agenda again in November, have run into serious difficulties among governments and MEPs.</p> <p>A senior EC official said the package meant a third of Europe's electricity would come from renewables by 2020, with a third of that from wind power - and a third of the wind power from offshore.</p> <p>The report, based on identified projects, assumes that 68.4 gigawatts of capacity at 118 wind farms will have been established in the North Sea by 2020-30 and could provide 13% of the annual electricity consumption of the seven countries.</p> <p>A recent European Wind Energy Association strategy paper estimated installed capacity, on land and offshore, could rise to 300GW by 2030 - accounting for 28% of power generation in the EU and a quarter of consumption, saving 600m tonnes of CO2. Yesterday's report using scientific data on wind speeds, suggests that the power output of wind farms could be stabilised within an integrated grid and supplemented by Scandinavian hydropower that can be easily switched on. The variability of wind speeds and, hence, of output has been a drawback of wind power.</p> <p>\"The grid would enable the efficient large-scale integration of renewable energy in the power system across the whole North Sea region,\" said Frauke Thies, a Greenpeace campaigner. \"A dip in wind power in one area could be 'balanced' by higher production in another area, even hundreds of kilometres away.\"</p> <p>Greenpeace estimates the cost of the scheme at between \u20ac15bn and \u20ac20bn but says it would unlock power trading opportunities and cost efficiency. A new 600km-power line between Norway and the Netherlands, it says, cost \u20ac600m to build but generates \u20ac800,000 in daily trading. It argues that such a scheme, boosted by other renewables such as tidal, wave energy and biomass, would eradicate the need for further investment in coal and nuclear.</p> <p>But EU officials are sceptical, suggesting that \"clean\" coal and nuclear are essential. \"We don't share the view that these are incompatible with renewables,\" one said. The growth of wind farms has been held back by planning disputes and the EC and Greenpeace urge greater European co-ordination in developing grids.</p>",
  "<p>Britain's international development secretary, Douglas Alexander, will today announce a global initiative aimed at preventing the misuse of western aid to developing countries through bribery, corruption and waste.</p> <p>In a plan backed by the World Bank, the United Nations Development Programme and the European commission, Britain intends to make it easier for people in poor countries to track how aid budgets are being spent.</p> <p>The UK wants donor countries to provide full and detailed information of all the financial assistance provided to each country; details of individual projects and their aims; and reliable information on future aid flows so that developing countries can plan ahead.</p> <p>Alexander will unveil the initiative at an international conference on aid effectiveness in Accra, Ghana, where he said: \"We see this as an important first step to increase certainty for both donors and the countries receiving aid. The impact of aid in relieving poverty can be greatly increased if everyone can see where the money's coming from, who is spending it and what it should be achieving.\"</p> <p>The Department for International Development said it was good at tracking aid from UK taxpayers, but Alexander is concerned that only half of all global flows of financial assistance show up on the budgets of poor countries, increasing the scope for the money to be siphoned off.</p> <p>\"The UK is vigilant against the misuse of aid and this initiative will be a crucial tool in the fight against it. If people can see where aid should be going and question whether it has been effective, the scope for corruption is greatly reduced,\" the development secretary said.</p> <p>With leading European donors such as Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Finland supporting the plan, Alexander expects the initiative to be in place by the end of 2009.</p> <p>DFID said that in Uganda, an information campaign of the type envisaged about education programmes helped increase the share of funds reaching schools from 20% in 1995 to 80% in 2001.</p> <p>The Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, an agreement that covers mining, gas and oil, has helped Nigeria increase its revenue collection by more than \u00a3500m.</p> <p>Jesse Griffiths, policy analyst at ActionAid, said: \"Donors take decisions which affect the lives of real people in poor countries, yet they are almost completely unaccountable to them. One key first step towards making aid more effective and accountable would be for donors to commit to the highest standards of transparency in Accra.\" </p> <p>Oliver Buston, of the development group ONE, said: \"We spend a lot of our time trying to persuade G8 countries to increase their aid budgets in line with the promises they have made. The response we hear from these donors is that they would love to increase aid but aren't sure it will be effective. It leaves a bad taste when the same donors fail to take simple measures to make aid more effective.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Kajaki dam is a monument to failed foreign dreams in Afghanistan. It was built by the Americans in the early 1950s as a cold war showcase, the sort of mega-scheme that was supposed to modernise the developing world. </p> <p>But the project was contentious and costly long before the battles of the last few years between the Taliban and western forces, which saw the US bomb the site in 2001 before attempting to begin reconstruction in 2004. </p> <p>Helmand's water has always been traded between the great powers of the day. In the 1930s Germany and Japan intended to divert part of the great Helmand river which flows into the deserts of Iran and never reaches the sea. But cutting off part of Iran's water supply, as the Taliban did briefly by shutting the dam, is controversial, and has had an environmental impact on the remarkable Sistan basin, an area of desert wetland. </p> <p>After the second world war, the US government moved in, funding the Helmand project through a company based in San Francisco which insisted every part be shipped halfway round the world from the US. By 1950 the UN was warning that the scheme was too expensive and would fail. But America persisted, establishing the Helmand Valley authority, modelled on the famous Tennessee Valley authority of Roosevelt's 1930s New Deal.</p> <p>Two dams were built, including the Kajaki. But they were never completed to the intended height, lacked power equipment and - most importantly - failed to bring about the planned green revolution. Only a third of the projected land was irrigated, and even that turned salty, so crops failed. </p> <p>Over two decades, the Helmand project consumed 20% of Afghanistan's national budget, as well as much US aid money. Cold war competition with the Soviet Union - which eventually took over part of the Kajaki project - saw the US fund the installation of two power turbines in the 1970s, and make space for a third.</p> <p>The gap is supposed to be filled by the Chinese-made turbine eventually trucked in this week, guarded by 4,000 troops. But even that can only reach its full potential if power lines are built to the city of Kandahar, 60 miles away. That will take time, and they will be vulnerable to Taliban attacks. </p> <p>Meanwhile, one of the old US turbines produces power. The other is in pieces, awaiting a refurbishment that began in 2004 but has been made impossible by insecurity. </p> <p>British forces have fought, on and off, for several years to secure the site and to allow construction of the road that can send heavy equipment up the Helmand valley. If the scheme is ever completed - and the level of the dam raised to the capacity planned in the 1950s - the Kajaki will provide power and perhaps some peace to southern Afghanistan. But its planned output of 51 megawatts is small, perhaps 6% of the country's power needs.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on Wednesday 17 December 2008. The Kajaki dam was bombed in 2001, not 2002. This has been amended.</p>",
  "<p>Food prices in the UK soared 10% in the year to August as retailers continued to pass on rising commodity costs to consumers.</p> <p>The British Retail Consortium (BRC) shop price deflator showed that fresh produce prices surged by 11.9% over the year, leading analysts to suggest that the Bank of England would leave rates on hold today. Overall prices increased 3.8% in the year to August, up from 3.2% in July and 1.2% in April. It was the biggest increase since the series began in 2006.</p> <p>Mike Watkins at Nielsen, the research group, which helps compile the survey, said: \"Shop price inflation is likely to continue through the autumn but we are hopeful that the acceleration in cost prices that has driven food prices up so sharply is starting to slow.\"</p> <p>Analysts said that the rise in high street prices may encourage the hawks on the monetary policy committee in their determination to throttle inflationary pressures, making a rate cut unlikely.</p> <p>\"The further sharp rise in the shop price deflator in August is not good news for the Bank of England,\" said Howard Archer at Global Insight. \"The marked jump in shop prices in August reinforces the belief that the Bank will hold interest rates at 5%, despite the ever-growing likelihood of recession. While we expect the Bank to cut interest rates before the end of 2008, we believe that it will not move before November when there is likely to be growing evidence that the deepening economic slowdown, weaker consumer spending and rising unemployment is diluting underlying inflationary pressures.\" </p> <p>Archer expects rates to fall to 3.5% in 2009. But David Blanchflower, the most dove-like member of the committee, believes the weakening state of the UK economy means rates should be cut now.</p> <p>A \"shadow\" monetary policy committee at City broker Cazenove yesterday voted 8-1 to cut rates by 25 basis points to 4.75%. </p> <p>There was some relief for the Bank yesterday as a survey showed that inflationary pressures in the services sector were beginning to cool. The Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply index measuring prices charged by companies fell to 55.2, the lowest reading since April. Firms' costs rose at the slowest rate since March, with the index dropping to 66.8 from 70.2. </p> <p>Activity in the services sector rose unexpectedly to 49.2 last month from 47.4 in July - just below the 50-point that marks the cut-off between contraction and expansion. City economists had expected a further worsening to 47. It suggested the slump in services - three-quarters of the economy - may be past its worst.</p>",

Earlier this year Able UK said it would be dismantling the Clemenceau at its yard in Hartlepool after it was granted a licence by the Health and Safety Executive. The ship contains 700 tonnes of asbestos. A spokeswoman for the HSE, which waived asbestos regulations to allow the vessel to be brought to Britain, said: \"We can confirm that the exemption decision has been challenged but the HSE cannot comment further until after the matter has been heard.\"<br><strong>Press Association</strong></p> <h2>Soldier 'playing' with rifle guilty of killing colleague</h2> <p>A soldier who shot a colleague dead while \"playing\" with a gun he assumed was unloaded was convicted yesterday of manslaughter. Rifleman Aarron Kendrick, 20, of 4th Battalion The Rifles, shot Edward Vakabua, 23, in a bunk room at Basra Palace in July last year. Kendrick, based at Warminster in Wiltshire, admitted negligently discharging an L96 sniper rifle. A court martial at Bulford, Wilts, took two hours to find him guilty. The prosecutor said in addition to picking up a gun he was not trained to use, Kendrick pointed it \"in jest\" at Rifleman Vakabua - \"a cardinal sin\" in the army.<br><strong>Press Association</strong></p> <h2>\u00a330,000 for James Bond set owned by real-life 007</h2> <p>A rare set of James Bond novels owned by the man thought to have inspired the character was auctioned for more than \u00a330,000 yesterday. The full set of Ian Fleming's 007 books came from the library of the late Sir Fitzroy Maclean, a former SAS soldier, diplomat and MP. The collection of books, papers and pictures at Edinburgh auction house Lyon and Turnbull included early editions of Dr No and From Russia With Love, as well as a first edition of Casino Royale. The set went to London book dealers Adrian Harrington, while the buyer, John Gilbert, is to use the rest of the material in research for a book. <br><strong>Scottish Press Association</strong></p> <h2>Back to school routine for teenage Olympian Daley</h2> <p>After the excitement of the Olympics, diver Tom Daley was plunged back to Earth yesterday when he started back at school. He had to sign a few autographs for schoolmates when he arrived at Eggbuckland community college in Plymouth, but then it was back to the grind of assembly and double Spanish. Daley, right, who is studying for nine GCSEs, said: \"It's great to see some of my friends again. I think being back in a normal environment is good for me.\" Headteacher Katrina Borowski said Daley, seventh in the 10-metre platform event, was a \"super role model\" for his classmates.<br><strong>Steven Morris</strong></p> <h2>Man admits fatal push after argument on bus</h2> <p>An 18-stone man admitted pushing a fellow passenger off a bus and killing him after an argument over swearing, Newcastle crown court heard yesterday.

Robson admitted manslaughter after a murder charge was withdrawn. He will be sentenced at a later date. Dixon's partner, Anne Fisher, who was on the bus, said after the hearing: \"We were due to get married next year.

The tycoon bought the five-bedroom American colonial-style house, which was built only six years ago, because he loved the location and the building's private helipad.

  "<p>A little over a week ago, Manchester City's executive chairman Garry Cook gave an interview which serves as a reminder of why we should always, always listen to the preposterous characters who run football.</p> <p>\"I was in Beijing last week,\" began Cook, \"sitting with [Thaksin Shinawatra] and the second richest man in China and other guys. They all want to be part of Manchester City. I've had representatives of companies from Dubai, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait on. Some of those representatives have actually phoned the supporters' club because they couldn't find the club number. So I get the supporters' club secretary saying to me, 'So the club is for sale, then, because I've got Anwar on the phone from Saudi Arabia?' This club is not for sale.\"</p> <p>Mm. We can't yet know whether the club's new Anwars are the type of people too stupid to be able to find its phone number, but they certainly talk an elegant game, thus far contriving to make Loadsamoney look like Gandhi. </p> <p>\"[Cristiano] Ronaldo has said he wants to play for the biggest club in the world, so we will see in January if he is serious,\" the deal's frontman Dr Sulaiman Al Fahim said on Tuesday, before casually mentioning he'd pay \u00a3135m for the United winger. \"But why not? We are going to be the biggest club in the world.\"</p> <p>With luck, there is something of the satirist to Dr Al Fahim, and he will go on to make ever more outlandish \"statements of intent\" - a phrase somewhat overused in recent days - perhaps outlining plans to purchase Rupert Murdoch for use as the club mascot, or acquiring Warren Buffett to man one of the Eastlands pie vans.</p> <p>As we all know, though, these days football is just a way of keeping score, by which of course one means keeping score in geopolitical powerplays, as opposed to in anything so low-level as games of football. Most crucial is Dr Al Fahim's statement that \"we hope that the purchase of City will help raise the profile of Abu Dhabi and emphasise the excellent work that is taking place there\".</p> <p>Tellingly, Dr Al Fahim already fronts one loss leader for the emirate, and so it is that Manchester City football club (est 1880) finds itself in the esteemed company of a reality TV show. And their shared frontman speaks about both of his properties in decidedly similar terms, recently declaring that \"the second season of Hydra Executives will once again highlight the promising prospects in Abu Dhabi as a key destination for entertainment, real estate and tourism sectors\".</p> <p>Hydra Executives appears to be loosely modelled on The Apprentice, with Dr Al Fahim in the Surallan role, though the prize of a $1m business grant does make the chance to work in Sugar's post-room look like rather small beer. At present, the show is aired in Abu Dhabi, but according to a February declaration of the credible Dr Al Fahim, he was \"finalising deals with leading television and media networks in Los Angeles and London\". As for which UK channel won what must have been a hotly contested bidding war ... to put it tactfully, no transmission date is yet scheduled. And yet, one can't help thinking these stalled negotiations are a blessing in disguise. </p> <p>Given the shared aims between the two ventures - both TV show and football club exist for the glorification of the emirate - would it not make sense for the good doctor to fuse them, and immediately begin shooting a reality series focusing on Manchester City? </p> <p>Certainly, the plotlines the new owners have already sketched out for the club make it ideal for this most spirit-warming modern medium. The show - call it Manchester Dhabi - could run along standard lines, with team-mates set a variety of amusing tasks, such as finishing in the top four of the Premier League, or enticing Cristiano Ronaldo to join without being able to promise him Champions League football, or stimulating $2bn property investment in Abu Dhabi, at the same time as distracting from its human rights record. </p> <p>These tasks will ideally lead to the holy grail of reality: conflict. Having said that, a credible punishment system also stimulates ratings, so failure to comply could result in team-mates being sent to one UAE's fine prisons, which may have failed to meet with the approval of those Lord Longfords in the US State Department, but are probably built in the shape of palm trees.</p> <p>And in keeping with all reality TV shows, Manchester Dhabi will conclude with all involved declaring they've gone on \"an incredible journey\". For once, it'll be hard to argue.</p>",
  "<p>Alan Curbishley is not a man generally given to grand statements but his actions yesterday flew in the face of the stereotype. As he tendered his resignation at West Ham United, eschewing the major pay-off that would have accompanied his sacking, he sent a clear message to his old friends in the managerial fraternity, the people whose opinion he cares about, and also perhaps to the man who will succeed him. \"If I am walking out on this job, just imagine how bad it is.\"</p> <p>The tipping point for Curbishley is acknowledged to have been the sales of the defenders Anton Ferdinand and George McCartney to Sunderland, decisions which were taken over his head, but the influence of events at Newcastle United 24 hours previously might have given clarity to his thoughts. </p> <p>Curbishley had watched Kevin Keegan boil over with frustration at the way his hands had been tied by people in positions of power and, when he looked at the mirror, he saw precisely the same concerns etched into his brow. </p> <p>He was already locked in a period of soul-searching. After he learned that McCartney would become the 10th signing of Roy Keane's summer at Sunderland, Curbishley had met his directors and poured out his anger and frustration. He told them he would consider his future over the break for international fixtures - West Ham's next match is not until Saturday week at West Bromwich Albion - but it did not take him long to conclude that his position was untenable. </p> <p>Curbishley believes that the arrivistes in boardrooms up and down the country, largely from overseas, as is the case at West Ham, with their Icelandic owner and chairman, Bjorgolfur Gudmundsson, will be the ruin of English football. He feels that among their ills, which include impatience and unrealistic expectations, is a lack of empathy for the role of manager. </p> <p>In time, he believes, the traditional British manager such as his great friend Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester United, who has the final say on all football issues, will be no more. Curbishley, with 17 years of managerial service behind him, and Keegan are cut from a similar cloth. Curbishley could not bear to become little more than a glorified coach and yesterday he reached his breaking point. </p> <p>The separation had been coming. Curbishley had felt increasingly isolated from the serious business of transfers and not only because the club had employed a technical director, the Italian Gianluca Nani. West Ham's backers, the Icelandic bank Landsbanki, have been hit by the global economic downturn and Curbishley had been told that players would have to be sold to ease financial pressures, which had been exacerbated by the profligate spending of the previous chairman, Eggert Magnusson. </p> <p>Curbishley thought that had been done when he raised \u00a36.3m by selling Bobby Zamora and John Paintsil to Fulham but if Ferdinand was a body blow then McCartney and the direction in which he felt the job was heading made him snap. \"The selection of players is critical to the job of the manager and I had an agreement with the club that I alone would determine the composition of the squad,\" said Curbishley, whose only significant cash signing this summer was Valon Behrami for \u00a35m. </p> <p>\"However, the club continued to make significant player decisions without involving me. In the end, such a breach of trust and confidence meant that I had no option but to leave.\" </p> <p>Despite two wins from three league fixtures of the new season, Curbishley continued to hear abuse from sections of the Upton Park crowd. The board were not alone in craving a charismatic leader and exciting football, and they felt the fans' refusal to take to Curbishley was the real motivation behind his resignation.</p> <p>He might also have paid for his difficulties in man-managing the more illustrious names in the dressing room. Curbishley has long been accused of shortcomings in this area, that he could prosper at \"little old Charlton Athletic\", as he would call his former club, but struggle when bigger egos were involved. Curbishley's methods remain decidedly old-school and there are different routes now to the psyche and confidence of the modern-day professional. It is understood there were more arguments with senior players after the win over Blackburn Rovers last Saturday. </p> <p>The talk among the players in the dressing room that day was of McCartney being on his way. Curbishley was unaware then of the reality and there was even sympathy for him from his most ardent critics in the squad. Curbishley, though, can at least say that he left on his own terms.</p>",
  "<p>Five years ago, the chances were that you wouldn't be able to name a single commercially viable nanotechnology. Today products incorporating innovations at the nano-scale are entering the market at a rate of four per week, according to the Project On Emerging Nanotechnologies (PEN). New energy and environmental applications are multiplying their share and researchers say they could become necessary in the fight against climate change.</p> <p>Andrew Maynard at PEN says: \"There is a lot of interest in doing things differently and not repeating the mistakes of the past. This time we want to make nanotechnology green from the outset.\"</p> <p>Lux Research, which analyses emerging technologies, found that of the $750m (\u00a3420m) of venture funding being pumped into the nanotechnology field (materials constructed at a scale of 100 nanometres or smaller) almost a third was going into green innovations. </p> <p><strong>Think small</strong></p> <p>Green innovations in the laboratory could significantly reduce hazardous waste chemicals. At Iowa State University, Victor Lin has been using silica nanoparticles to synthesise biodiesel from vegetable oil. Inserting catalysts inside the nanoparticles resulted in waste products that could be recycled more easily than those used in traditional methods.</p> <p>Green nanotechnologies come in a variety of shapes, but one almost universal trait is that the materials make better use of the space they take up. Carbon nanotubes - in effect, atom-thin sheets of graphite rolled up into a tube - are stronger than steel but incredibly light, so they reduce energy consumption if used in cars or aircraft.</p> <p>\"Typically in the solar industry, you have these huge municipal installations which cost double what you would normally pay on the grid, and are therefore subsidised,\" says Erik Oldekop of NanoSolar. \"Even thin-film cells use slow and expensive vacuum production processes and are then deposited on to glass and steel.\"</p> <p>NanoSolar avoids all these costs by printing a nanoparticle ink directly onto a substrate, which can then be used to collect energy. It delivers energy efficiencies that he hopes will make solar power as cheap as the competing fossil fuel technologies. </p> <p>\"We are shipping now and sold out for the foreseeable future,\" says Oldekop. While NanoSolar is not selling to the residential market, in theory nano ink could one day be used to print solar cells directly from a desktop computer.</p> <p>Water filtration is another area that is using nanotechnology. \"Two years ago investors weren't interested in a water filter that could be made for $1 per person per year,\" says Lisa Farmen of Crystal Clear Technologies. Now her company has $1.2m in seed capital and has developed a water filtration technology that uses nano-porous minerals to absorb heavy metals, bacteria, viruses and petroleum-based hydrocarbons, all in one filter. When the absorptive layer has been filled up, a new layer is poured on top.\" Says Farmen: \"We hope it will be a low-cost water filtration technology that will be affordable by most of the world's population.\"</p> <p>A hidden advantage of Crystal Clear's filter is that the zeolite minerals have smaller particles than their non-engineered cousins. More atoms at the surface and fewer inside means a greater surface area for pollutants to react with. Farmen says: \"Even if the river is polluted, you can go straight to the river.\"</p> <p>Johnson Matthey is a UK company which specialises in oil and chemical refining but has recently moved into hydrogen fuel cells. Its catalysts and membranes are built from nanoparticles which increase the surface area available for chemical reactions inside fuel cells.</p> <p>\"Our core components provide some of the best power densities on the market,\" says Martin Green of Johnson Matthey. \"Honda, General Motors, Toyota and Hyundai are all bringing hydrogen-powered fleets to market before 2010, and we're involved with many of them,\" he says, adding: \"The residential market is another sector being looked into.\"</p> <p>Another application will be as a backup energy source for telecoms companies. \"If there's a power outage, you will be able to switch to a bank of clean fuel cells and a bottle of hydrogen,\" says Green. \"This is a huge improvement over current technology, essentially banks of car batteries.\"</p> <p><strong>Is it safe?</strong></p> <p>There is still uncertainty about the health risks. Maynard says: \"Because of the sophisticated structure of nanoparticles their behaviour is different. And with a release of nanoparticles, they're so small they can get to places larger particles couldn't get to.\" He cautions: \"There is a lack of information in society about the actual risks of nanotechnology. People have a voice and if decisions are based on misinformation we could all lose.\"</p> <p>Kodak's organic LED display is an example of nanotechnology already being used in a consumer product. Kodak has nano-engineered a luminescent material that removes the need for backlighting in television screens and handheld devices.</p> <p>As with the other innovations, OLED is cutting the cost of materials and increasing energy efficiency. The colour quality and luminescence are apparently unmatched by existing screens, plus they can be rolled up if required. The first televisions to incorporate OLED nanotechnology are in the stores now. And that's just one of the many products that will be finding their way to market.</p>",
  "<p>Not a lot is known about Harald Blatand, the 10th-century king of Denmark (son of Gorm and father to Forkbeard), except that he united warring factions in Sweden, Norway and Denmark into a Christian community. He probably wouldn't be known at all in this country but for the fact that a group of people saw what Blatand had done as a metaphor for what they were about to try to do: the formidable task of persuading a number of normally uncooperative industries to adopt a common standard for a new short range wireless technology - Blatand, or Bluetooth, as it translates into English.</p> <p>That was 10 years ago this month, and while I don't see signs of any street parties, it deserves to be celebrated. This is not only because, after a shaky start, Bluetooth - whose radio signals can be sent for up to 10 metres - is now embedded in products from cordless headphones to wireless printers and even pedometers, but also to how it happened, which contains lessons about industrial strategy. </p> <p>Its HQ is now in the US, but it was a European initiative - take a bow, Ericsson - that set a global standard instead of leaving warring corporations to establish their own as the de facto norm. Its role model was GSM (Global System for Mobile communications), which established a standard in mobiles for Europe and most of the world outside America. It is the main reason Europe is ahead of the US in mobile phone technology.</p> <p>It is no coincidence that Europe has some of the most successful corporations developing Bluetooth, such as Cambridge Consultants and its spin-off, Cambridge Silicon Radio (CSR). As the world becomes ever more competitive, it will become increasingly important to pay attention to such apparently mundane things as setting global standards, which hardly ever hit the headlines but which can have a huge impact on the distribution of economic growth. </p> <p>Bluetooth, already embedded in 75% of mobile phones, is likely to get more successful as its range improves to up to 100m, its use of energy falls and its new applications, such as satellite positioning for cars, get more popular. I don't yet like wearing a Bluetooth earset for my phone because they are still too cumbersome and tricky to work with your fingers. But they are popular with drivers because they are a legal - though not entirely safe - way of using a phone while driving. I don't doubt I will eventually succumb.</p> <p>Many users still don't know that Bluetooth enables you to send photos directly to your laptop or to another similar phone. It can be used as a modem to access the web from your laptop (but beware of data charges) or to find a like-minded person in a room or walking down the street. One of the numerous applications available at the Bluetooth Gift Guide Event in London this month is a Sony Ericsson Bluetooth watch that links to a phone in your pocket so you can monitor calls or text messages without drawing attention to the fact. This is one way the watch industry is fighting the fact that the ubiquity of mobile phones means you don't really need a watch.</p> <p>The list of Bluetooth products - from cordless keyboards to Polaroid's PoGo instant printer for mobiles - is an ever growing one. It has transformed the gaming industry through applications for the Wii and PS3. The industry claims that more than 1bn Bluetooth devices have been shipped, and by 2011 it will be 2bn. </p> <p>The success of Bluetooth is probably only just beginning and some of its most popular uses have probably not even been dreamed of yet. It hasn't got a particularly attractive name. Maybe it should have been called Blueberry after the way King Blatand reportedly turned his teeth blue by eating too many of them. Is it too late to change?</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:vic.keegan@theguardian.com\">vic.keegan@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Airlines will post losses of $9.3bn (\u00a35.2bn) over the next two years as a \"toxic combination\" of high fuel costs and dwindling demand ravages their finances, the industry's trade body has warned.</p> <p>The latest gloomy forecast from the International Air Transport Association (IATA) comes as more airlines are expected to join UK-based Zoom and Silverjet in the bankruptcy courts over the next 18 months. </p> <p>IATA said it anticipated a loss of $5.2bn this year and released 2009 estimates for the first time which predict a deficit of $4.1bn, bringing the total loss over the period to $9.3bn.</p> <p>\"The situation remains bleak. The toxic combination of high oil prices and falling demand continues to poison the industry's profitability,\" said Giovanni Bisignani, IATA director general. Record fuel costs have forced 25 airlines out of business since January, with Zoom the latest to ground its aircraft and disrupt the travel plans of thousands of passengers when it ran out of cash last week. </p> <p>Further bankruptcies are expected this winter as the industry enters a traditional quiet period after the peak summer season, resulting in drastically reduced cash flows as ticket revenue falls. </p> <p>Brian Pearce, chief economist at IATA, said the multibillion-pound losses could worsen significantly if, as in previous airline recessions, passenger numbers started falling. Under current forecasts, IATA still expects passenger numbers to increase by around 3% this year and next. Pearce said global passenger growth numbers for July were the lowest for five years, indicating that the oil price-led pressure on profits could be exacerbated by a decline in customers and fare revenue.</p> <p>\"In past downturns we have had absolute falls in passenger numbers and, if the deterioration we have seen in June and July continues, we are perhaps being too optimistic,\" he said. </p> <p>The majority of losses this year will be shouldered by US carriers, IATA said, with the industry's biggest market expected to lose $5bn. Profits generated by European carriers will be reduced seven-fold, falling from $2.1bn last year to $300m. Profits from one of the fastest growing regions, Asia-Pacific, will also slump from $900m to $300m.</p> <p>Bisignani said that there will be little respite in 2009. Fuel is expected to account for 40% of airline budgets, up from 36% this year, and will increase the pressure on carriers to change their business models, while governments face growing demands to lift restrictions on industry consolidation, he said.</p> <p>\"You simply cannot continue to do business in the same way. Fundamental change is needed,\" said Bisignani. Airlines have already taken drastic action to conserve costs and the industry will fly 60m fewer seats between October and December - equivalent to a 7% reduction in costs. \"Two years of losses in a weak economic environment means that there will have to be changes. There will be consolidation and shrinkage in capacity,\" said IATA's Pearce.</p> <p>British Airways said yesterday that it carried 100,000 fewer passengers in August, with the biggest fall occurring on its European short-haul routes. It also warned that the outlook for its highly profitable premium traffic, which rose 2% in August, was \"uncertain\". Any gain from a recent fall in the oil price has been largely offset by the weak pound, BA added.</p> <p>\"Market conditions for the industry remain very difficult, with the strong dollar largely offsetting the benefit of the recent fall in oil prices,\" said BA. IATA predicts that the cost of oil, which has fallen from its peak of $147 per barrel to less than $110 per barrel, will be around $110 per barrel next year. </p> <p>BMI, the second largest carrier at Heathrow airport, became the latest to indicate that it will cut capacity yesterday as it confirmed that a small reduction in seats was likely. Nigel Turner, BMI's chief executive, said: \"There are some capacity reductions in the winter.\" </p> <p>He said the airline would not put its Heathrow take-off and landing slots at risk and would obey \"use it or lose it\" guidelines to use them 80% of the time. </p> <p>Tim Bye, BMI's deputy chief executive, also warned that the recent drop in the oil price was not enough and that the price needed to fall below $100 per barrel.</p> <h2>Backstory</h2> <p>The oil spike has claimed only relative newcomers to the airline industry so far. As well as <strong>Zoom</strong> and <strong>Silverjet</strong>, carriers offering UK services that have collapsed over the past year included <strong>Eos</strong>, <strong>Maxjet</strong>, <strong>Oasis Hong Kong</strong> and <strong>Nationwide Airlines</strong>. More are expected to follow and bigger names, led by <strong>Alitalia</strong>, are also struggling to survive. However, the more established airlines, bolstered by cash balances built up during the good times, are able to seek alliances - and <strong>British Airways</strong> has been one of the busiest, announcing merger talks with Spain's <strong>Iberia</strong> and seeking regulatory clearance for a tie-up with <strong>American Airlines</strong>.</p>",
  "<p>Our capital structure is built to survive almost any trading environment. That was always Punch Taverns' answer to those who questioned whether a portfolio of pubs - even a collection of 8,400 - was capable of supporting \u00a34.8bn of debt.</p> <p>Chief executive Giles Thorley isn't retreating from his boast but yesterday he gave his investors a fright. He cut the dividend entirely - an action normally associated with a management desperate to hoard cash, not one that describes trading as \"broadly in line with expectations\" and is happy with cash flows.</p> <p>Thorley's explanation is that a \u00a3295m bond falls due in 2010 and, given the state of the capital markets, prudence demands that he start saving now. He also talks about the need to \"continue to invest in our pubs alongside our licensees.\"</p> <p>The latter phrase is worrying. Many of the tenants are currently incapable of paying the rent, let alone investing. Rent concessions have risen 50% since the last time Punch updated the market. Thorley says he is comfortable with the 3% level of concessions but the unanswered question is how high the figure could go, and how generous Punch, as landlord, can afford to be with other measures, such as drinks discounts and promotional support for tenants.</p> <p>The apocalyptic scenario is one in which empty pubs and struggling tenants force down rents permanently, thereby reducing the value of Punch's property, the base on which the whole financial structure is built.</p> <p>We're not there yet. Trading is weak, with like-for-like sales down 3.4% in the tenancies and 3.3% in the managed houses, but there are plenty of consumer businesses doing worse. It's also true that the bulk of the \u00a34.8bn debt is repayable over 28 years at 6.6% - a structure that looks more robust than many of Punch's rivals'.</p> <p>Yet this is the moment when Punch, and the rest of the pub industry, was meant to be bouncing back after the smoking ban. </p> <p>There is no sign of that. Instead, there is anecdotal evidence that the punters are happy to stay at home to watch the football and to drink cheap booze bought at supermarkets.</p> <p>Punch's market value has fallen to \u00a3750m. By failing to pay an annual dividend of only \u00a337m, it leaves the impression that it is trying to save slops when the real problem is the barrel-load of borrowings in the cellar. It doesn't inspire confidence.</p> <p><strong>Ospraie's dive</strong></p> <p>Dear Investor, </p> <p>We rode the commodities boom for all it was worth but we had too many chips on the table at the wrong moment. We lost 27% of your cash last month, and we've blown 38% since January. What can we say? We ran out of luck.</p> <p>This was not the wording Dwight Anderson of US hedge fund Ospraie adopted in his letter of apology to investors yesterday. He offered this: \"These losses were primarily caused by a substantial sell-off in a number of our energy, mining and resource equity holdings during a six-week period characterised by some of the sharpest declines in these sectors in the past 10 to 20 years.\"</p> <p>But, really, is there any difference between the two versions? Okay, the slump in the oil price and in mining stocks has been spectacular, but so was the run-up in these assets. Given that the commodities bull market had lasted seven years, surely a \"good steward of capital\" - to use Anderson's phrase - would have allowed for the possibility that prices could come rattling back at speed. Instead, Ospraie seems to have made a series of concentrated, and leveraged, bets. It is a specialist commodities fund so investors knew the dangers. But they could also have expected better risk controls from a major hedge fund with a reputation to protect. Instead they have been reminded of the oldest rule in the book: never confuse genius with a bull market.</p> <p><strong>Electronics spark</strong></p> <p>The shares fell 4% in the morning after a horrible trading update; they closed up 8%. What happened at DSG, the old Dixons group?</p> <p>There was some chat about a bid but the other element seems to be the emergence of a fan club for new chief executive John Browett. Morgan Stanley's analyst swooned over how he \"gave the clear impression of having got on the top of the business operationally.\" </p> <p>At the moment, it is just an impression - DSG's latest like-for-like sales are down across the board, from PC World to southern Europe. But you can see the possibilities if Browett's three-year plan works - DSG is valued at six weeks' sales.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:nils.pratley@theguardian.com\">nils.pratley@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Every six months, for the better part of my life, I have been making a seasonal journey to Bangladesh. I left Dhaka at the age of two, and I have always called it home, though the city my parents and I left in the 70s is unrecognisable, now a jumble of Lego-shaped buildings, barely a road or a tree between them. My visits home, which used to consist of lazy rickshaw rides around Dhanmondi Lake, are now spent waiting in the frozen car-seas of Dhaka traffic. And, of course, there are family visits and long lunches and my parents, who wait eagerly for me and shower me with affection, no matter how old I am, or how often I have disappointed them by refusing to move back.</p> <p>But this time around, I am leaving the city and travelling to an island off the banks of the Jamuna river, to learn how people are adapting to a difficult environment. I was recently told by a journalist that, having written a novel about the birth of my country, perhaps I should now write about its death. Bangladesh is sinking under the weight of the rising seas, one of the first victims of our transforming climate. Already there are great swaths of land in the coastal belt that have surrendered to the tides. </p> <p>The facts about climate change in Bangladesh are indeed grim. The country is a low-lying delta, meaning any slight shift in sea levels will cause the land to be slowly swallowed by the waters of the Bay of Bengal. In the next 50 years, 17% of Bangladesh's landmass is sure to go underwater, causing more than 30 million people to become homeless. Those who live further inland will be only slightly better off: the cyclones and floods that are already a feature of the weather will occur more frequently and with greater ferocity. Geological events stimulated by changes in temperature will mean intense pulses of rainfall followed by periods of drought, and a potential collapse of the monsoon cycle itself. If the sea level rises by 5m (16ft), Dhaka will go under. This is the grim reality that the delegates of the UK/Bangladesh climate change conference, taking place in London next Wednesday, will aim to address. In expectation of the climate change deal that will be struck in Copenhagen next year, it is critical that Bangladesh's concerns are more widely known and understood.</p> <p>But I have no intention of sounding the death-knell. I know that people in Bangladesh have, for generations, adapted to the cruelties of nature, and my destination is an example of their tenacity. Deep in the delta, a group of islanders, repeated victims of flooding and river erosion, have found a way to live with their unreliable, unforgiving landscape. The small islands on which they live - forced there because, in a country of 180 million people, every inch of available space has to be used - have an average life span of nine years before they are made uninhabitable. I wonder how these islanders cope with this shifting terrain; how they can bear to know that the place they are living in today may not exist tomorrow. I want to know because more and more people in Bangladesh will suffer the same lot, as the sea creeps up; and because, in the not so distant future, this may be the fate of humanity worldwide. </p> <p>The Jamuna river is often called the \"Jamuna braid\". It is 22km at its widest point and it splits into estuaries and channels, diverging and reconnecting to create a shifting landscape that is part land, part water. It is in the Jamuna braid that most of Bangladesh's chars are located. The chars - islands made of river silt - are strange land formations that inhabit the space between land and water. Every year in Bangladesh, new chars emerge out of the river's changing course; and as they appear, old ones are returned to the water, swallowed by the river as though it is collecting on an old debt. The story of these chars, and the people who inhabit them, is a catalogue of migrating loss, of land earned and forsaken. Here, in the Jamuna braid, the Chars Livelihood Project (CLP), a collaboration between the Bangladesh government and the UK's department for international development, has been helping islanders cope with their uncertain terrain.</p> <p>It takes three hours to crawl out of Dhaka, and after crossing the Jamuna Bridge, we arrive at the office of our local hosts. Habibullah Bahar has been working on this stretch of the Jamuna river for almost three decades. He is softly spoken, and piles my plate with breakfast as I quiz him about the chars. There is a not-quite-thereness about them. \"Who owns the land,\" I ask, \"is it the government?\" He smiles in such a way that I feel foolish for even asking. Of course not; a place that will only exist for an unknowable amount of time is not going to come under the umbrella of the state. </p> <p>Chars don't become habitable until they are a few years old. You can tell their age, Bahar tells me, by the wild plants that grow on them. When chars are taken by the river, often their inhabitants have to move in with their relations, or find some other piece of land on which to build a house. In any case, they will only have enough on which to live: they have nothing to till, so the men hire themselves out as weavers or day-labourers. This is why, according to development-speak, char-dwellers are the \"hard-core poor\". It is because they own nothing, and even the ground beneath their feet is a fleeting luxury.</p> <p>After breakfast, we make our way to the riverbank, where a six-seater speedboat waits for us. The men climb into waterproof jackets and trousers. I am wondering what to do with my sari, when I am offered a long robe. \"Burkha,\" the speedboat driver tells me, \"waterproof\". I'm in the middle row, next to Bahar, and he hands me an umbrella. It's raining on the shore, but I can't imagine why I would need an umbrella on a speedboat.</p> <p>It takes about a minute for me to find out. Our swift movement upriver barrels water into the boat, and there it is joined by lashings from the river-tide. The small estuary widens, the banks yawn open, and the water splashes on to our laps. The umbrella saves me from being beaten in the face, but I'm soaked through, burkha and all, before we have barely begun. </p> <p>On the way, Bahar points out the new islands. \"This one came up last month,\" he says, pointing to a small stretch of muddy land. The riverbank is jagged, and every once in a while I see chunks of it breaking off and disappearing into the water. Two hours later, we veer off the main river and the banks narrow. The driver switches off the engine, a group of men arrive on shore to pull our boat into the channel, and we arrive on Chouhali char.</p> <p>The landscape is dimpled, the homesteads rising out of the ground in neat rectangular plots. This is what the CLP is giving the islanders. They call them plinths. Char-dwellers have always built their homesteads on raised ground, knowing that their proximity to the water means that their land will be the first to go under in the event of a flood. The CLP project has taken this model and raised the homesteads of the poorest islanders. They have also given them access to clean water, latrines and a small cash advance. There are still parts of the island that can be walked, but in a few weeks, with the monsoon, each of these homes will be surrounded by water, little islands of their own.</p> <p>The first thing I notice is that there are no men in the village. No one owns any arable land, so the men hire themselves out as day-labourers. Most of them work as weavers in nearby towns. The absence of men means that women do all the work: cutting grass for their cows, collecting firewood, patching up their homes with whatever they can find, tending their gardens. And, of course, there are children to raise and feed. </p> <p>Chouhali has no electricity, no running water, no hospitals, roads or government offices. It has a school, a long, rectangular building that has been divided in two for the upper and lower grades. When the floods arrived last year, it was this building that sheltered the villagers whose homes were submerged. The children stand to attention when we arrive, and a boy in a black sequined shirt offers to perform for us. \"When I die,\" he sings, \"who will come to bury me?\"</p> <p>I am supposed to stay the night with Joneka, whose plinth is a few months old. Of all the poor residents of Chouhali, Joneka is considered one of the poorest. Before I meet her I am told that she is a widow. Having no land of her own to till, and no man to provide a weekly wage, she and her two young sons rely on her small patch of garden for food. Recently, the CLP has been giving her a small stipend, to tide her over until she can sell her cow in the market. </p> <p>I arrive on Joneka's plinth. She wears a long blue dress with a matching scarf. Her features are severe, but as soon as she sees me she breaks into a smile and greets me as though we are old friends. I ask after her in the common Bengali greeting, \"Kemon achen?\" (\"Are you well?\"), and she replies confidently in her only word of English: \"Fine.\" On one side of the plinth is Joneka's house, a flimsy structure that is held together with grass and jute. The thatched roof is leaking. She is going to get a piece of tin in the next few weeks; the one she has, borrowed from her brother-in-law, is for the cow. The inside of the house is crowded with all her possessions: a small bundle of firewood, two cooking pots, and a stove built into the ground. </p> <p>I ask Joneka how her husband died. \"The electric current fell on him,\" she says. \"We were visiting my sister in town. No one came to help because they knew they would die too if they touched him. They took him to the hospital, but it was too late.\"</p> <p>Joneka couldn't go back to her in-laws' house and, as a married woman, her father would no longer take her in. She relied on the charity of her sisters, and spent six years living on the edge of starvation. It wasn't until she moved to Chouhali, and came under the CLP, that she was given a cow, a latrine and a source of clean water. Once she sells the cow in the market, she will have enough savings to become self-reliant. I ask her if she will remarry, and she shakes her head resolutely. \"If I married,\" she says, \"I wouldn't be able to keep my children.\" I think of my grandmother, who was widowed at 26 and never remarried. She has always told me it was because she didn't believe any man would love her children as he should.</p> <p>Joneka and I spend long hours together. She lays out a jute mat for me, and while she sews a blanket (she will sell it to a neighbour for 50p), we talk of many things. She asks why I am not married, and I describe my life of freedom and exile in London. My tongue is loose and easy. But as evening draws near, the rain starts. Joneka's roof is leaking again, and there is not enough dry space, between the stove and the firewood, for us both to sleep. I bid her farewell as it grows dark, after she has prayed by the light of her hurricane lamp. She will eat a quick meal and fall asleep early; she doesn't want to use too much oil.</p> <p>On the day I am to leave, Joneka hosts a gathering of women from the village. I ask them how many times the river has taken their homes. \"Eleven,\" one says. \"Seventeen,\" says another. Each time, they have barely escaped with their lives, every one of their possessions gone in a flash. I play with their children as they tell me, in loud voices, how grateful they are for their raised ground. They want to thank me, and I have to explain that it has nothing to do with me. \"I'm only a writer,\" I say. \"I've just come to write about you.\" Why have you come all this way, they want to know, and I can't give them a straight answer. \"It's true,\" I say, \"I have come a long way, because I wanted to meet you. I am not here to give you anything.\" Joneka looks resplendent in her only sari, and she holds me to her chest. \"You are my sister,\" she says.</p> <p>I return to Dhaka, forsaking the speedboat for the slower, more melancholic country boat. On the way, I see more breaks on the riverbank, and, all of a sudden, a tree floating on the surface of the water. It hovers, vertical, for a moment before sinking into the swirl of the tide. </p> <p>At home, I cannot stop thinking about Chouhali. When I am asked about the trip, I find myself not knowing what to say. I am reminded of what VS Naipaul wrote in The Enigma of Arrival, his memoir about exile. \"I saw what I saw very clearly. But I didn't know what I was looking at. I had nothing to fit it into.\" I'm struck dumb by how little I still know. I thought I would come back with an idea of how the Chouhali islanders had learned to live their lives of uncertainty; how they built their houses and grew their crops, how they fed themselves and raised their children, how they patched their roofs and grazed their cattle. And I wanted more intimate truths: how they bore up against the cruelties of their environment; what it was that allowed them to keep on after their homes had been taken by the river 10 or 20 times. But I learned nothing of that. I can only say that I began to feel my way around the vast, impenetrable mystery that lies in the distance between my life and Joneka's.</p> <p>It is time to return to London. On my last day, as I am saying a tearful farewell to my grandmother, wondering if she will still be here when I come again, the phone rings. Joneka has borrowed Bahar's mobile to say goodbye. \"Did you get your tin?\" I ask. There is a smile in her voice as she tells me that she sent her brother to the market. \"The roof is solid,\" she tells me. \"Now you can come and stay\".</p> <p><strong> \u00b7 </strong>Tahmima Anam is the author of A Golden Age, published by John Murray at \u00a314.99.</p>",
  "<p>They are plucked off pizzas and discarded from caesar salads across the country, but somebody, somewhere has been eating too many anchovies. The fish that has divided food fans for years is today named on a list of unsustainable fish and shellfish that ethical consumers should not eat. </p> <p>Anchovy is among dozens of \"fish to avoid\" highlighted by the Marine Conservation Society (MCS). Anchovy populations in the Bay of Biscay have been struggling since 2002, as overfishing left fewer adult fish to provide eggs. The fishery suffered a complete failure in 2004 and is now officially closed. Stocks in the other big European anchovy fishery - off the Portuguese coast - are also critical. Anchovies are still legally caught there, though quotas have been restricted. </p> <p>In a report on hundreds of types of fish, the society has awarded each kind a ranking from 1 to 5, after assessing its biology, stock status, management and the impact of the farming or fishing method. Sixty-nine received the worst rating of 5, including monkfish from north and northwest Spain, North Sea cod and dogfish. Others to avoid include the Atlantic salmon, common skate and swordfish.</p> <p>The society's list does not label entire species unacceptable to eat, but tries to explain that whether a certain type of fish is sustainable or unsustainable depends on where and how it was caught. It gives Dover sole caught by wasteful beam trawling in the North Sea and Irish Sea a 5 rating and says they should be avoided, while those from a sustainable fishery off Hastings are rated 2 and recommended.</p> <p>Such detail is rarely made available to consumers, with current legislation only requiring the common name and rough geographical location to be included on labels. The society is calling for better labelling in restaurants and shops to help consumers choose more environmentally-friendly options.</p> <p>Sam Wilding, a fisheries officer with the society, said: \"Labelling of seafood sold in the UK is lacking detail, and as such is not fit for purpose. This is leading to confusion. It is vital that consumers are given better information to act upon if we are to reduce the tragedy of overfishing.\"</p> <p>He said anchovies in European waters were at an all-time low. \"There are not many anchovy left in European waters, and we say people should avoid them, to give populations a chance to recover.\"</p> <p>Willie Mackenzie, oceans campaigner at Greenpeace, said: \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/04/fishing.wildlife\">You pick up some tuna in a supermarket</a> and it might say it comes from the Indian and Pacific oceans. Well, that covers half the world, it could be one of several different species, and it could have been caught in lots of different ways. We really need better labelling with more detailed information to help consumers do the right thing.\"</p> <p>Chris Brown, head of ethical and sustainable sourcing at Asda, said more detail risked confusing customers. He said Asda stocked marlin, which features on the MCS's \"fish to avoid\" list, but claimed it was sustainable because it was not deliberately targeted, but caught as inevitable \"by-catch\" in a sustainable tuna fishery off Sri Lanka, and would otherwise be disposed of. \"I can't write all of that on the label,\" he said.</p> <p>Brown said it was down to retailers to take more responsibility, and accused some restaurants and supermarkets of confusing the situation by selling sustainable ray, but labelling it as unsustainable skate, because customers are more likely to buy familiar species.</p> <p>The society said cod demonstrated why precise labelling was important, with cod from the north-east Arctic a more sustainable choice than those from the North Sea.The MCS has certified some cod fisheries in the Pacific as sustainable, and also said consumers could choose organically-farmed Atlantic cod. Wilding called on shoppers and diners to ask more questions about the source of their fish. \"Our advice is to ask the waiter or waitress. They might not know at the moment but part of what we're trying to do is to improve training, and raising awareness is important for that.\" He said the society had produced a pocket-sized version of the list that could be used as a reference.</p> <p>Philip MacMullen, head of environmental responsibility at the industry body Seafish, said: \"It is genuinely difficult to be sure of all the details of any given fish supply line. To this extent advice given via lists ... must match the reality of the available information. We should not be raising unrealistic expectations. The complexities of fisheries also mean that it is difficult to rely on a simple eat-and-avoid list. Fish stocks are dynamic and can change their status quite quickly.\"</p>",
  "<p>Five years ago, outside Liverpool Street station in London, a group of 13 young men gathered for what was, at the time, the biggest meeting of freerunners in history. The sport, in which participants perform balletic leaps and flips using walls, bars and any other street furniture available, was still in its earliest infancy, mushrooming spontaneously across Britain among young people who had seen films of the French urban sport parkour and wanted to adapt it into a freer and more expressive form.</p> <p>How times change. Last night, the once underground pursuit declared itself firmly in the sporting establishment by holding its first world championships, hosted in one of London's top venues, sponsored by a major credit card company, and filmed by Sky Sports.</p> <p>\"I never, ever thought we'd get to this place so quickly,\" said John Kerr, or \"Kerbie\", one of the event's organisers. Present at that inaugural gathering at Liverpool Street, he finds himself, at 21, one of the sport's elder statesmen. </p> <p>\"We all feel amazingly blessed. Freerunning is so young and so new. A few years ago we were getting chased by police on a regular basis and property owners would shout at us. Now they pay us to come and perform on their properties.\"</p> <p>Fifty feet above him, one of the event's 23 competitors was warming up by balancing in a handstand on the edge of an enormous black box, part of the equipment on which he would later compete, before flipping on to a nearby bar, spinning around it, and dismounting. Below him, his peers - those not already performing \"gainers\" and \"loser flips\" and \"layout backflips\" from a lattice of steel poles - murmured approvingly. The sport might be said to combine the best qualities of gymnastics, cat burglary and teenage mucking about, but the skill of the participants is unarguable.</p> <p>Few underground activities can claim to have made it into the mainstream with such dazzling speed. Many participants trace the birth of freerunning to a BBC \"ident\" in 2002, showing a parkour runner adapting his skills on the rooftops of London. </p> <p>Urban Freeflow, the sport's central organisation, was founded a year later. Though closely related to parkour, which originated in the Paris suburbs a decade ago, that pursuit prizes speed and efficiency of movement, in contrast to the expressiveness of freerunners. As such, though it is practised worldwide - last night's competitors hailed from 17 countries - freerunning could reasonably be described as a brand new British sport. </p> <p>Urban Freeflow now trains the Metropolitan police and Royal Marines, as well as organising workshops in schools, and estimates that 15,000 people now practise the sport in Britain (95% are male). </p> <p>The organisation choreographed action sequences for the films Casino Royale, the Bourne Ultimatum and 28 Weeks Later, and performs at civic events - an outlet so lucrative that it is able to support 30 professional athletes. </p> <p>As the founder of Urban Freeflow and the organiser of last night's competition, Paul \"EZ\" Corkery could be considered the grandfather of freerunning - at 34, he considers himself retired. He is in discussions with the 2012 Olympic organisers over how freerunning might be involved, perhaps in the opening ceremonies, or in workshops. </p> <p>\"The organisers are really eager to collaborate with anything that gets the kids off their arses,\" he said. Does he see a day when freerunning might be an Olympic sport? \"I don't really think it fits. You'd need to put in place a national governing body, things like that, and it would kill the sport, really.\"</p> <p>While there was no doubting the competitors' eagerness to excel yesterday, freerunners may also have something to learn about Olympic competitiveness. The world champion was to be selected by a vote among his peers. Was there any risk of tactical voting? </p> <p>\"Oh no. These guys are my YouTube idols, it means everything to be here with them,\" said Franck \"Cali\" Nelle, from France. How badly did he want to win? \"I'm not really thinking about the podium. It's just being here alongside the best of the best. The first ever freerunning world championships? That's a big event. That's history books.\"</p>",
  "<p>There would be \"no return to boom and bust\" under this government, Gordon Brown used to insist with teeth-grinding regularity, as if he and Tony Blair had somehow managed to do away with the trade cycle altogether. Such claims could not seem more ridiculous today, as the economy sinks towards recession and forecasts of doom multiply, both inside and outside government. The only argument now seems to be how far back in time we have to go to find conditions as grim: Charles Bean, the Bank of England's deputy governor, reckons the 1970s; the chancellor of the exchequer, the 1940s; while Ed Balls, his rival for Brown's favour, has settled on the 1930s. </p> <p>However alarmist all that might sound, one year on from the first impact of the US-incubated credit crunch the direction is pretty clearly all one way, as consumer and business confidence continues to plummet, unemployment heads relentlessly upwards, living standards fall, manufacturing output drops and the housing market has as good as ground to a halt. And far from New Labour putting an end to boom and bust, the OECD club of rich countries has now forecast that Britain will be the only major world economy to tip into full-scale recession this year.</p> <p>That news only added to the sense of a damp squib around what had been heralded as the opening salvo of the prime minister's \"economic recovery plan\" - that Downing Street now insists was never intended to be anything of the kind. That's just as well, if Tuesday's hotchpotch of measures aimed at staving off meltdown in the housing market is anything to go by: welcome as far as it goes in bailing out people facing repossession, modestly boosting social housing and even more marginally cutting the cost of cheaper homes.</p> <p>But if we're talking about serious action to counteract the impact of the slowdown, this package will barely register - and all the signs are that next week's expected measures to ease the impact of higher fuel bills are likely to be similarly underwhelming. Meanwhile, the contradictory nature of this week's announcements - attempting to bolster house prices with a cut in stamp duty while at the same time trying to make them more affordable for first-time buyers - only underscores the price that is now having to be paid for New Labour's self-defeating reliance on an unsustainable, credit-fuelled housing boom to keep the economy afloat.</p> <p>It's perfectly true that the main factors behind Britain's current economic woes, as elsewhere, are global: the credit squeeze and the escalation in oil and other commodity prices have all been external shocks. But New Labour's single-minded promotion of a highly deregulated, short-termist and lightly taxed financial sector at the expense of the rest of the economy - manufacturing has taken the greatest strain - on the back of a consumer borrowing binge has left Britain especially vulnerable both to the global downturn and to the credit contagion in particular. It is almost as though the economy had been set up for a crash - and we're now living with the consequences.</p> <p>If the government is to escape from its current political black hole, and the country from the worst of a recession, it's going to have to turn its back on the structural mismanagement of the past decade and be prepared to take much more far-reaching measures than the sort of tinkering on offer this week. It could do worse than start by listening to the demands from its own backbenchers, the TUC and the business select committee for a multibillion-pound windfall tax on the energy corporations to relieve escalating fuel poverty and pay for mass home insulation. There was some hopeful indication yesterday from No 10 that the proposal has not after all been ruled out, but don't hold your breath. </p> <p>Naturally, the companies have squealed, threatened and orchestrated a media campaign against such a raid on their swollen coffers, while ministers have struggled to persuade them to cough up voluntarily. The case could scarcely be stronger. These are corporations whose profits have increased sixfold in five years on the back of a double windfall - from rising oil and gas prices and the \u00a39bn worth of carbon trading permits they were given by the government for free - while forcing the poorest (many of them voters Labour needs to win back) to pay price increases far larger than in other European economies. </p> <p>Critics argue such a tax would hit investment or simply be passed on in yet higher prices. But long-term investment plans certainly didn't depend on unforeseen windfall profits, and the risk that consumers might be made to pay is a good argument for the kind of price controls on the energy utilities that exist in France and elsewhere. In fact, one political benefit of a windfall tax is that it could help to open the door to a much tougher regulation regime in a phoney market that has signally failed to deliver the goods - and raise the common-sense case for a publicly owned industry, perhaps on Nordic or French lines.</p> <p>But at the heart of a genuine recovery package has to be a powerful boost for demand, to turn round falling output. Whether that takes the form of shifting some of the tax burden from the lower paid to the wealthy and the corporate sector, extra borrowing or interest rate cuts, some change to the fiscal and monetary rules Brown set himself in his early days as chancellor is going to be needed. That may not be as difficult as it sounds as recession starts to bite, given that his entirely arbitrary 40% debt ceiling and \"golden rule\" on borrowing have already been mangled out of recognition - and the Bank of England's one-sided inflation target already risks deepening a recession in the kind of stagflationary conditions it wasn't designed for.</p> <p>That's only the start, of course. With at best a stagnant economy, pressure will grow to make sure the costs of the downturn are borne by those most able to afford them. And if the mistakes that led us to this impasse are not simply to be repeated, there will also have to be a shift towards tougher regulation of corporate Britain and the capital markets, as well as a programme of publicly driven investment in manufacturing and research and development. In a changing economic climate, with the Tories unable to break with a failing model, that should be good politics as well as economics. But as things stand, the prime minister shows little sign of even beginning to make the necessary change.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:s.milne@theguardian.com\">s.milne@theguardian.com</a></p>",

  "<p>As one of the games industry's colossi, you'd expect Will Wright's latest game to be epic, but Spore is more ambitious in its scope than any game ever: he could have called it Sim Universe. Spore is essentially five games in one, with stages titled Cell, Creature, Tribal, Civilisation and Space. Inspired by the 1977 Eames film Powers of Ten, it starts you off gently by giving you control of a single-cell organism, which you evolve until it can leave the sea and walk up the beach. The Creature phase is the one that has generated the most publicity: it allows you to design an organism from scratch - although, in truth, aesthetic whims are less of a priority than making use of the body parts you acquire with their attendant properties. Evolve sentience and you must attempt to dominate an area of your planet in the Tribal stage; once you dominate a planet in Civilisation, you can head off to the stars for some surprisingly relevant (in these days of global warming) terraforming. Spore's best phases are Creature, Tribal and Space - Civilisation is too dependent on manic activity when you first start playing it. But the consistency between phases (the scope alters, but basic gameplay principles, such as the option to play aggressively or diplomatically, still apply) is stunning, the whole experience feels thoroughly fresh and innovative, and you will want to replay it several times. Essential.</p>",

  "<p>Challenging art by Goldsmiths students has gone on show in the university secretary John Denham's department for the first time.</p> <p>At the exhibition's launch yesterday, Geoffrey Crossick, the warden of Goldsmiths, University of London said: \"Goldsmiths is taking art into the heart of government.\"</p> <p>The exhibition of \"contemporary and challenging art work\" came about after a meeting with Ruth Thompson the director general of higher education at the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills, who asked Crossick to fill the department's dreary walls with students' art.</p> <p>Gerard Hemsworth, professor of fine art at Goldsmiths, who curated the exhibition, said: \"Art offers reassessment of what we already know. At Goldsmiths we enable students to have the confidence to ask questions\u2026 the work in this exhibition presents us with new values.\"</p> <p>Delyth Morgan, the students' minister, said: \"It's not because we are the department for universities, we asked because we want to have in our space and working environment, some work that will challenge us and help to make us think.</p> <p>\"Governments aren't always seen as particularly creative but we do believe we have a role to play in creating the right kind of environment for artists to thrive.\"</p> <p>The work will be on display until September 22.</p> <p>Goldsmiths students are also about to take over exhibition space in Heathrow's Terminal 5 from the Royal College of Art, Crossick said.</p> <p>And the college is planning to open a new gallery on campus to exhibit students' work, which is currently displayed at end of year shows in temporary spaces on campus.</p> <p>\"They're great spaces for this purpose and are adapted by the technical team to meet the students' needs, but they're used for working studio space the rest of the year,\" Crossick explained.</p> <p>\"Students also, of course, display their work in commercial galleries as the galleries identify new talent. This is sometimes the case with BA students, much more common amongst masters of fine art and PhD students. </p> <p>\"Students are for obvious reasons keen to establish these relationships, because they're important for their future careers.

  "<p>One of the world's leading climate scientists yesterday called for an immediate halt to the building of all coal-fired power stations to prevent catastrophic global warming.</p> <p>James Hansen, a former White House adviser and Al Gore's science adviser, giving evidence in a British court, said sticking to a \"business as usual\" approach would see the planet passing its climate change tipping point.</p> <p>Hansen was giving evidence in the case of six Greenpeace supporters charged with causing \u00a330,000 of criminal damage when scaling the 200-metre Kingsnorth power station chimney in Kent last October.</p> <p>The group admit causing the damage when painting the name \"Gordon\" on the chimney but argue that they were acting legitimately to prevent widespread climate change. The prosecution claims the group went beyond the bounds of acceptable protest.</p> <p>Asked what his message to Gordon Brown would be, Hansen said: \"I would ask him to make a clear public statement for a moratorium on new coal-fired power plants that do not capture CO2. There is enough potential in renewables for our energy requirements. The moratorium should be immediate. We do not need new coal-fired power plants. They all need to be phased out over the next 20 years.\"</p> <p>Hansen, director of the Nasa Goddard Institute for Space Studies and a professor at Columbia University, said the man-made rate of change of atmospheric CO2 was 10,000 times greater than natural.</p> <p>He warned that 1m species would be made extinct because of climate change and calculated that Kingsnorth, which emits 20,000 tonnes of CO2 a day, would be responsible for 400 of these.

  "<p>A slump in sales of electronic goods at PC World dragged down its parent, DSG International, as the credit crunch hit consumer spending this summer.</p> <p>Sales at PC World slipped by 12% in the 16 weeks to August 23. Across the group, like-for-like sales fell 7% with sales at Currys and Currys Digital - its electrical chain in the UK - also down 7%. DSG's Elkj\u00f8p stores in Scandinavia posted a 4% fall while southern Europe - Italy, Spain and Greece - suffered a 12% drop. Total sales, including new stores, were up 4%, benefiting from a strengthening euro.</p> <p>\"We are not expecting a quick recovery,\" said DSG's chief executive, John Browett. \"From what we can see from customers they are taking to heart the credit crunch and therefore I think it's going to be quite a while before we'll see anything from the market which helps us. Certainly we don't see any recovery this year or next year.\"</p> <p>Shares in DSG dropped more than 6% on the news but later recovered. They have lost two-thirds of their value over the past year. \"Overall this is a pretty dire trading update that highlights how tough things are out there, and ahead of the peak Christmas trading season,\" said Matthew McEachran, analyst at Kaupthing.</p> <p>Pali International's Nick Bubb forecast DSG would make a first-half loss. The figures were worse than the 4-8% fall predicted by the City. UBS had pencilled in a 4.5% fall in the UK, the basis of its \u00a3115m pretax profit forecast for the year, already below the \u00a3120-\u00a3130m consensus forecast in the City. Gross profit margins worsened by 0.75% on the year.</p> <p>Browett launched a strategic review in May, pledging to \"transform the DNA\" of the group. DSG has slashed costs by \u00a350m and plans further savings of \u00a325m this year. The company is refitting its PC World and Currys stores in Britain and retraining 20,000 staff by Christmas. It also plans to bring to the UK a new large-store format of 50,000 square feet, which has proved successful abroad.</p> <p>In Italy, it is closing loss-making stores and trialling new formats for PC City within UniEuro stores.</p> <p>Freddie George, of broker Seymour Pierce, described the decline at PC World as \"alarming\" and reiterated his \"sell\" recommendation on the shares. He said he would downgrade his profit forecast of \u00a3155m. \"Poor results from the Italian operation and PC City in Spain confirm to us that the company is having difficulty selling these operations,\" he said.</p> <p>\"From our visit to see the new PC World format at Enfield it is clear that there are no easy answers on strategy for the UK business - PC World and Currys.\" He noted that in the new format at Enfield, which will be rolled out to the rest of the chain, the company has substantially increased the TV ranges and introduced cameras and music systems, thereby increasing the overlap with Currys.</p> <p>Philip Dorgan, of Panmure Gordon, said he thought profits would fall for the next two years. \"It is not just the consumer environment that is working against DSG - its problems are structural. The business review attempts to tackle these issues, but we fear that it will take a very long time indeed to hit its margin targets.\"</p>",
  "<p>Marks &amp; Spencer has dismissed the \"whistleblower\" who leaked details of its plans to reduce redundancy pay.</p> <p>The employee, a manager at its Paddington head office, was suspended last month and appeared before a three-hour disciplinary hearing on Monday.</p> <p>Yesterday M&amp;S confirmed the employee had been dismissed. \"It was not an easy decision nor one that was taken lightly,\" said a spokeswoman. \"He broke the company's rules and regulations and deliberately leaked internal company information and made derogatory and speculative comments to the media despite the fact we have a number of internal routes available to address employee concerns.\"</p> <p>She said M&amp;S did not accept he was a whistleblower because there had not been any wrongdoing by the company.</p> <p>Maria Ludkin, legal officer for the GMB union, who represented the suspended worker, described the decision to sack him as a \"gross act of corporate bullying\".</p> <p>She added: \"The disappointing part is that M&amp;S head of global HR John Wareham stated that the 25-year-long service of this employee is totally irrelevant to the decision to sack him.

  "<p>The media love a good argument, and what better than to pitch polemicists against each other from opposite ends of the spectrum? Thus we are given Bj\u00f6rn Lomborg v Oliver Tickell in a so-called \"climate debate\" (Tickell's apocalyptic view obscures the solutions; <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree+environment/climatechange\">Lomborg's stats won't mean much underwater</a>, August 21). Regrettably, we learned from this only that sensible solutions are unlikely to flow from entrenched and extreme positions. Most scientists are amazed and alarmed that the issue of climate change should be treated as an article of faith - something either to be believed or disbelieved - rather than a problem surrounded by a lot of uncertainty. What we got from these two was very misleading.</p> <p>Lomborg claimed: \"A lead economist of the IPCC [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] did a survey of all the problems and all the benefits accruing from a temperature rise over this century of about approximately 4C. The bottom line is that benefits right now outweigh the costs.\" There have been a few studies of the current effects of climate change (for example, on ice shelf and glacier retreat, and on plants and animals) and the IPCC has concluded these are happening faster than had been expected. But despite what Lomborg says there has been no useful assessment of whether these are beneficial or not, because aggregation of effects involves meaningless trade-offs such as comparing the destruction of Inuit communities with the benefits of ice-freed shipping lanes.</p> <p>Lomborg believes that 4C of global warming \"will not be a challenge to our civilisation\" and derides Tickell, whom he quotes as stating that warming of this amount would bring \"the beginning of the extinction of the human race\". Both of these are heroic conclusions, since there has been no study of the limits to our adaptive capacity. The climate change issue has never been about whether we can survive or not, but keeping damages and costs to a tolerable level. The IPCC concluded in 2007 that we risk billions more people being short of water due to climate change, and hundreds of millions at risk of flooding and hunger. That is a lot of suffering, but not the end of civilisation.</p> <p>There is a strong emerging view, proposed by the IPCC in its latest assessment in 2007, that a careful mixture of mitigation (reducing emissions) and adaptation will be necessary to meet the challenge of climate change. And this is broadly accepted by governments now striving for agreement by the end of next year. The polarised views of both Tickell and Lomborg miss this completely. We know we cannot avoid some serious climate change (our vacillation over the past 10 years has put paid to that), but we can avoid the worst of it. At a minimum we will have to adapt to about 2C of warming. The choice still available to us is whether we should try to avoid more than this amount of warming. Common sense suggests we should, since we do not really know what impacts the future holds, and we risk repeating the mistake of the movie producer Lew Grade who, looking back on the mounting losses of his film Raise the Titanic, concluded: \"It would have been cheaper to lower the Atlantic.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Martin Parry led the 2007 assessment of impacts and adaptation by the IPCC <a href=\"mailto:martin.parry.ipcc@googlemail.com\">martin.parry.ipcc@googlemail.com</a></p>",
  "<p>This week the Royal Society published a special edition of its journal, Philosophical Transactions, dedicated to \"geo-engineering\" interventions to combat global warming. Its initiative deserves to be welcomed, not rejected out of hand. The time may come when we need to geo-engineer in order to maintain our planet in a livable state.</p> <p>Doug Parr, Greenpeace UK's chief scientist, made the case against: we should muster serious political will, and equally serious finance, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Using existing and proven clean technologies from wind turbines to concentrated solar power, we need to bring about a worldwide renewable energy revolution. If we do the above, he implied, we will not need any \"outlandish\" or \"outright dangerous\" geo-engineering solutions.</p> <p>He is right in everything he is calling for. In fact, he could have gone further. We need major investments in energy efficiency and conservation, as well as in renewables. We need to bring an end to deforestation and rebuild ravaged forest ecosystems. We also need an agricultural revolution in which farmers draw down excess carbon from the atmosphere into soils, enhancing their ability to retain moisture and nutrients as well as mitigating global warming.</p> <p>But even if we do all the above, can we be sure of preventing climate catastrophe? No. The Earth's climate system is characterised by feedback loops which can amplify even a small initial perturbation. And it seems that following an initial post-industrial warming of 0.8C, one major positive feedback process is already well under way, in the Arctic. </p> <p>Last year saw a record melting of Arctic sea ice. This year, that record has been broken: for the first time in history, the northern ice cap can be circumnavigated. And with melting ice, more sunshine is absorbed rather than reflected back into space. The result is more warming, and more melting. In turn this increases the degassing of methane from Arctic bogs, lakes and thawing permafrost - and methane is a powerful greenhouse gas in its own right, 70 times stronger than CO2 over 20 years.</p> <p>If we rapidly cut our emissions of greenhouse gases, it might bring an end to the \"Arctic amplifier\". Or it might not. It is entirely possible that the melting of the sea ice and the emissions of Arctic methane have already reached a point of no return that will lead to a warming world no matter what we do. It would be imprudent not to insure ourselves against this possibility. </p> <p>This means setting up a global research programme into geo-engineering options. The most valuable options are those that will have immediate effect by directly altering the Earth's thermal balance. Two proposals stand out. First, the introduction of sulphate aerosol to the stratosphere to reflect sunlight. There are fears that this could damage the ozone layer, but then we know that volcanoes routinely discharge millions of tonnes of sulphate into the stratosphere, cooling the Earth without inflicting long-term harm.</p> <p>James Lovelock, who developed the Gaia hypothesis, warns of global acidification as the stratospheric sulphate mist slowly falls to the ground. However this problem is easily solved. We already emit 50m tonnes of sulphur a year, mainly as sulphate from power stations and shipping. This is 10 times more than would be used for geo-engineering purposes, and that could be more than offset by additional cuts in emissions.</p> <p>Better still is the proposal by physicist John Latham and colleagues to raise the reflectivity of marine clouds. This would involve a fleet of wind-powered yachts criss-crossing the world's oceans, controlled by a global network of satellites, blowing out a mist of ultra-fine salty droplets to act as cloud condensation nuclei. Latham's solution promises to be inexpensive, highly effective, environmentally benign, and reversible in a matter of days as the droplets are washed from the sky in rain.</p> <p>One major question is that of who should be responsible for any interventions. The best-placed body is the UN climate convention (UNFCCC), whose major achievement to date is the Kyoto protocol. Its main objective, to \"prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system\", by stabilising greenhouse gas concentrations, should be extended to accommodate the possibility of geo-engineering. </p> <p>This would also provide clarity as to the purpose of geo-engineering. Doug Parr decries it as an \"expression of political despair\" that would only produce business-as-usual emissions. Lovelock sees it as a temporary palliative before inevitable disaster strikes. We must make sure they are both wrong. Geo-engineering should be developed strictly as a firefighting capability to maintain long-term climatic stability, not as a substitute for all the other actions we should be taking. </p> <p>If the topic enters into discussions at the UNFCCC meeting in Poznan this December, member states must ensure that the two approaches are firmly linked so that no geo-engineering is permitted unless accompanied by deep and rapid cuts in emissions. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Oliver Tickell is author of Kyoto2 <br><a href=\"http://www.kyoto2.org\">kyoto2.org</a></p>",
  "<p>Hurricane Gustav has come and gone, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/02/hurricanegustav.hurricanekatrina\">New Orleans is still standing</a>. The levees held. This is a great relief for the city's evacuated residents, not to mention people around the world who watched with dread as a deadly hurricane bore down on the Louisiana coastline just three years after Hurricane Katrina. </p> <p>Katrina was a good teacher. Government agencies at all levels learned from the debacle that ensued when the levees broke in 2005 and tens of thousands of New Orleans' poorest residents were trapped in the city for days, many without food and water. This time, a near-total evacuation took place. The New Orleans city government worked with the state and federal counterparts to assemble a fleet of buses that got most of those without transportation out of the city. It declined to open the Superdome as a \"shelter of last resort\", forcing residents to choose between evacuation or risking their lives. Fema pre-positioned more supplies and response teams close to the affected area. The levees, only partially rebuilt and restored post-Katrina, were closely monitored for potential breaches.</p> <p>But luck also played a large role here. Neither agencies nor flood-protection structures were tested with a truly catastrophic situation, in which plans can easily go awry. Gustav, once a powerful Category 4 storm, weakened to Category 2 by landfall, and it passed far enough to the west to deliver the New Orleans area only a glancing blow, generating nothing near the awesome strength of Katrina's storm surge. </p> <p>That's why there's a real danger now that confidence born of the successful response to Gustav could turn to overconfidence. The fact is, being better prepared than in 2005 isn't saying all that much. Take Fema. An <a href=\"http://www.govexec.com/dailyfed/0408/040308cdam1.htm\">April report</a> by the inspector general for the US department of homeland security, of which Fema is a part, said the agency had a long way to go and was still plagued by \"budget shortfalls, reorganisations, inadequate information technology systems and confusing or limited authorities\" over the areas it's supposed to run. That suggests in a true national emergency, Fema might break down just as it did before.<br> The New Orleans levees, meanwhile, are only midway through <a href=\"http://www.mvn.usace.army.mil/hps\">an upgrade due to be completed in 2011</a>. Even then, though, it still won't protect against flooding from a direct hit by a big storm. And the fact that the city's <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/02/us/02corps.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin\">largest canal nearly overflowed</a> during Gustav, which turned out to be a relatively mild storm, isn't good news either. Already, another three storms are queuing up in the Atlantic, some or all of which may hit the US coast over the next two weeks. It's no time to breathe easy.<br> The fact is, due to feedback from human activities, nature has begun to change faster than US government institutions can keep up. There's a healthy scientific debate over the <a href=\"http://www.ucsusa.org/global_warming/science_and_impacts/science/hurricanes-and-climate-change.html\">potential role of global warming in hurricane activity</a>. Some scientists believe a warming atmosphere will lead to more powerful storms. Others say the effects will be minimal. But most everyone agrees that hurricane activity in the Atlantic is in a dangerous, possibly decades-long upswing.</p> <p>If it is indeed amplified by global warming, we're going to see some storms unlike any in the past in the coming years. Meanwhile, the lure of living on the coast (and along riverbanks) has put many millions more people in the path of danger, along with their valuable properties, increasing the risk of huge, Katrina-scale losses that will test the insurance industry and the federal government's budgetary limits.</p> <p>Is there any way to head this off? Both <a href=\"http://www.johnmccain.com/Informing/News/NewsReleases/D9A7248A-95FC-477A-BE73-F75DE7445F2C.htm\">John McCain</a> and <a href=\"http://www.barackobama.com/issues/additional/#katrina\">Barack Obama</a> have pledged bigger, better levees for New Orleans and sharper emergency response in general. That's to the good. But it's not just a matter of building new structures and appointing competent people (though it would be a good start). If he wants to avoid future Katrinas - and more generally, to meet the challenges posed by global warming - the next president should work to change the way government institutions operate.</p> <p>Currently, for example, decisions on infrastructure, including flood protection, are made by congressional committees. In other words, those decisions are almost wholly, arbitrarily political. There's no easy way to change that, but the president ought to set some national priorities on what to build where, and push them hard, so the public expects changes - not just more pork for local districts.</p> <p>On a deeper level, though, the government needs to become less reactive, more nimble. Institutions that do the work of fortifying the country against disaster - including the army corps of engineers, in charge of building levees - are notoriously traditional and slow-moving. They're designed for an era that's already over. If they're shaken up and redesigned from the top down, perhaps the US can get out in front of these looming problems.</p>",
  "<p>A US hedge fund partly owned by the troubled investment bank Lehman<br>Brothers has folded after suffering huge losses on energy, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/mining\">mining</a> and<br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/commodities\">commodity</a> punts, in a fresh sign of pain among secretive, high-rolling alternative investment funds.</p> <p>Ospraie Management, based on New York's exclusive Park Avenue, told<br>investors that its main fund had lost 38.6% of its value this year, prompting a decision to liquidate its assets.</p> <p>The fund suffered a disastrous August, losing 26.7% of its net worth in a<br>single month. It is run by Dwight Anderson, a veteran investor who is well known in the commodities trading world.</p> <p>In an apologetic letter sent to clients this week, Anderson said it had been a \"very difficult\" year and that he was \"extremely disappointed\" with the outcome.</p> <p>Anderson cited a sell-off in energy, mining and resources shares over a six-week period that he described as \"some of the sharpest declines in these sectors in the past 10 to 20 years\". Ospraie has been scrambling to reduce risk by de-leveraging its bets.</p> <p>\"Not only as portfolio manager, but as one of the largest investors in the Ospraie Fund, I have shared in these losses with you,\" wrote Anderson. \"After nine years of striving to be a good steward of your capital, I am very sorry for this outcome.\" </p> <p>The fund's demise is a financial blow to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/lehmanbrothers\">Lehman Brothers</a>, which bought a 20% stake in Ospraie Management three years ago.

Their downward spiral has caught many investors on the hop. </p> <p>Hedge funds, which ramp up risk by taking both long and \"short\" positions on stocks going upwards or downwards, tend to experience an exaggerated effect.</p> <p>Figures compiled by Chicago-based Hedge Fund Research suggest that the average fund lost 3.43% in the first seven months of this year - beating the stock market as a whole, but failing to impress investors who have been withdrawing money in large quantities.</p> <p>Ken Heinz, president of Hedge Fund Research, said funds were far from homogeneous, with some enjoying the greater volatility - but he said those with a strategy of investing on broad-scale \"macro\" market trends were facing challenges.</p> <p>\"We've seen the environment in the last nine to 12 months characterised by much more challenging conditions in really every way,\" said Heinz. \"We're now seeing a difference between funds able to deliver returns in volatility and those that aren't.\"</p> <p>A sustained downward trend in the price of oil, metals and agricultural produce could cause a further shake-out in which funds fold or merge with each other.</p> <p>Randal Goldsmith, director of fund research at S&amp;P Fund Services, said:<br>\"There are hedge funds that have taken significant positions in commodities and, if it did prove to be a bear market, a lot of hedge funds would be in<br>trouble.\"</p> <p>Other funds nursing big losses include London-based GLG Partners, which reported a sharp drop in fees last month and is estimated by the Wall Street Journal to be down 23% in its largest fund. </p> <p>GLG was founded by Noam Gottesman and Pierre LaGrange, who were named by Alpha magazine as Britain's top earning hedge fund managers.</p>",
  "<p>Even before the Olympics, China struck fear across the world. To westerners, China steals our shirts and jobs, pirates our technologies and pollutes \"our\" atmosphere. Developing countries are no stranger to such concern - particularly Mexico. </p> <p>A quarter-century ago, China and Mexico were large, one-party, protectionist developing countries. Both chose to reform their economies by globalising them. Mexico's globalisation strategy came straight out of the Washington consensus handbook - they rapidly slashed tariffs and deregulated the state hoping to lure trade and investment. China took a more gradual, government-managed approach to globalisation. Mexico is losing.</p> <p>After signing the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Free_Trade_Agreement\">North American Free Trade Agreement</a> (Nafta) in 1994 and gaining unrivalled access to the US, things initially looked good for Mexico. Then, in 2001 <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1548866.stm\">China entered the World Trade Organisation</a> (WTO). Five years later, China became the United States' second largest trading partner, supplying 17% of all US imports. Mexico came in third with a share of less than 10%.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog/DEVEME.html\">2005 Inter-American Development Bank/Harvard University study</a> found that of all Latin American countries, Mexico had the potential to be most hurt by China because Mexico's \"export basket\" (the profile of the types of products it exports) was most similar to China's. In <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=PublicationURL&amp;_tockey=%23TOC%235946%232008%23999639991%23694300%23FLA%23&amp;_cdi=5946&amp;_pubType=J&amp;_auth=y&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=0b65ff37db918affb7df55681098265b\">a paper published in last month's World Development</a> with colleagues from the UN and Tufts University, I found that indeed Mexico was losing ground. We show that over half of all Mexican exports to the US are under \"threat\" from China. Export for export, Mexico is rapidly losing ground in the US market, and China is gaining. This is a looming crisis for Mexico, where 85% of all exports go to the US. </p> <p>Why is China surging so far ahead of Mexico in the US market? After all, it takes 18 days to ship goods from China to the US but no more than 18 hours for most of Mexico. What's more, with Nafta Mexico faces virtually no tariffs for exporting to the US, whereas China's tariffs are close to 6%.</p> <p>The answer: Mexico's approach to globalisation is hands-off, whereas China's is hands-on. Sticking to the orthodoxy of the Washington Consensus, Mexico's relatively high interest rates have led to a persistently overvalued currency. Heterodox China consciously undervalues its currency to subsidise the development of export markets. From 1986 to 2006 the exchange rate of the Mexican peso to the US dollar has appreciated 21%. The yuan depreciated by almost 80% during the same period. </p> <p>The dismantling of Mexican industrial policy is also to blame. Mexico hoped that Nafta would attract foreign firms and trade that would create linkages with the broader Mexican economy and spur growth. They <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/08/usforeignpolicy.colombia\">learned the hard way</a> that such linkages don't happen without parallel public policy. Foreign investment became an enclave by importing 95% of their inputs (many from China!) rather than working with Mexican firms.</p> <p>Alongside the foreign firms that have flocked to China, the government selectively targets key national firms with infrastructure, credit and research and development. This makes Chinese firms attractive partners to global ones and sets the stage for broad-based growth. China had the smarts and space to conduct such policies under WTO and fights hard to keep that space in global trade negotiation. Unfortunately for Mexico, there is a straightjacket wrapped around industrial policy under Nafta.</p> <p>Throw in China's lower wages and Chinese exports become an offer US consumers just can't refuse.</p> <p>Today's high prices (propped up in part from Chinese demand) for Mexican crude oil distract Mexico from the China threat. Yet <a href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2006/06/30/MNGAAJN9JG1.DTL\">Mexico's proven reserves may dry up in 10 years</a>. Thus the country will soon have to turn to manufacturing exports as an engine of growth. By that time, China may have taken away the ladder to economic development that Mexico seeks to climb.</p>",
  "<p>Dick Cheney's whirlwind Caucasus tour, which <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/europe/09/03/cheney.azerbaijan.tour/?iref=mpstoryview\">began today</a>, will be interpreted by conspiracy theorists, Kremlin apologists, and by the Russian government, as further \"proof\" of their contention that the hawkish US vice-president and his neocon buddies deliberately provoked last month's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/georgia\">Georgia</a> crisis for American presidential election campaign purposes.</p> <p>The White House says Cheney will assess Georgia's future needs and study the broader implications of Russia's partitioning of the country when he meets President Mikhail Saakashvili in Tbilisi. The Bush administration was meanwhile due to announce a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/03/usa.georgia\">$1bn bilateral economic aid</a> package to rebuild Georgia, in addition to an emergency $750m stand-by loan arranged via the IMF.</p> <p>A senior administration official said Cheney and Saakashvili would study the implications of the crisis and discuss \"a comprehensive long-term strategy by the international community to help Georgia recover, including the critical task of supporting the democratic choice of the Georgian people to integrate further with Euro-Atlantic institutions, including Nato\". That means, among other things, continuing and possibly increased US military aid.</p> <p>This statement should give pause to the architect of Russia's invasion, prime minister Vladimir Putin. Having been rebuffed earlier this year by France and Germany in its attempts to gather Georgia into Nato's fold, the Bush-Cheney team is now redoubling its efforts to bind the former Soviet republic to the west. If Europe won't help, the US will go it alone. Its powerful naval presence in the Black Sea is a token of this renewed and deepening commitment.</p> <p>Putin's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/01/russia.georgia1\">bullyboy behaviour</a> has thus backfired. And it is likely to have a similar effect in terms of closer US relations with oil-rich Azerbaijan and a rattled Ukraine, where Cheney will also visit. Thanks to the Russian leader, Christmas has come early for the ageing cold warrior who is rapidly approaching enforced retirement. Cheney now looks less like a visiting dignitary and more like a general inspecting frontline positions.</p> <p>Cheney's contention that Russia represents a threat that must be confronted and contained has been given a new lease on life by Putin's putsch. Those in Moscow and in Europe who hope to increase a modernising, reforming Russia's engagement with international institutions and international crisis management have suffered a blow.</p> <p>Cheney and Putin deserve each other. At bottom, both men are backward-looking holdovers from the past. Describing Putin, Paul Quinn-Judge <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/s/csm/20080903/cm_csm/yquinnjudge\">writes</a> in Christian Science Monitor, \"he can best be characterised by the term 'sovok' \u2026 In this case, it can be summarised as someone who embodies the dark and circumscribed world view of the Soviet man in the street, suspicious of the outside world, resentful, who holds a grudge and remembers a slight. Putin speaks passionately about the 'tragedy' of the Soviet Union's collapse, a personally scarring time when he found himself unemployed.\"</p> <p>Cheney doubtless feels the same about the way the protracted Iraq disaster (not South Ossetia) has blown an irreparable hole in his dream of an omnipotent, all-dominating unipolar American empire championing a one-size-fits-all global values system and underpinned by unmatched military might.</p> <p>All the same, the suggestion that Cheney, making one last throw of the geo-strategic dice, actually engineered the South Ossetia crisis by effectively luring innocent, unwary Russian armed forces into a Georgian bear-trap does not bear close examination. The fact that Putin, and his front man, President Dmitri Medvedev, continue to claim that the whole plot was hatched in Washington to boost John McCain's campaign does not make it true.</p> <p>The sobering truth is, the bumbling, blinkered Cheney is not that clever.</p> <p>It is certainly the case that the US provided military trainers and instructors to the Georgian military and has done so since the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4532539.stm\">2003 Rose revolution</a>. It also provided military equipment and logistical assistance to help Georgia build up its defences and prepare for a Nato membership bid. Although Moscow may not have liked it, there was little that was clandestine about this US policy.</p> <p>And in any case, Russia continued to keep its troops on Georgian territory under a spurious peacekeeping banner, tolerating and in all probability abetting all manner of provocations launched by South Ossetian separatist militia.</p> <p>It is also the case that a McCain adviser, Randy Scheunemann, acted as a Washington lobbyist for the Georgian government, although he apparently severed those ties in May. Scheunemann undoubtedly sympathised with Georgia's position vis a vis Russia. But lending a sympathetic ear or even urging a tough line is very different from persuading or inveigling Georgia's leadership into an unwinnable, costly and ultimately deeply humiliating military confrontation.</p> <p>Even if you insist on believing Georgia was egged on into war by scheming Republican neocons, who may after all conveniently be blamed for most worldly ills, pause a moment to look at the resulting campaign fallout in the US. Has the Caucasus confrontation given a boost to McCain as the putative plotters hoped? It has not. So-called \"cold war II\" has been almost completely overshadowed by his nomination of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/commentisfree+world/sarahpalin\">Sarah Palin</a> as his running mate.</p> <p>In short, cheerleader trumped war-maker. Faced by Miss Congeniality, \"Commie dude Putin\", as columnist Maureen Dowd calls him, had no chance. Palin is probably a better shot, too \u2013 certainly better than Cheney. </p> <p>Saakashvili may be a hot-head. But he has not survived as long as he has in a tough neighbourhood by acting stupid at the behest of people like Cheney. \"Some months ago I was warned by western leaders to expect an attack this summer,\" <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121988657412478425.html?mod=googlenews_wsj\">he told Melik Kaylan</a> in a Wall Street Journal interview last month.</p> <p>As related by James Traub in the New York Times, the months leading up to the August conflagration saw escalating provocations by South Ossetian forces and the Russian air force to which the Georgians responded, usually proportionately. During this period the US state department, anxious to avoid an escalation, repeatedly told Saakashvili to keep his cool.</p> <p>But in hindsight, it seems Putin was just biding his time until the moment came when Georgia overreacted. When it eventually did, in early August, his military plan of campaign was ready, the troops, marines, planes and ships were on alert and within easy call, and he immediately flew back from the Olympics to take charge.</p> <p>Saakashvili went on: \"I ask everyone to consider, what does it mean when hundreds of tanks can mobilise and occupy a country within two days? Just the fuelling takes that long. They were on their way. Would we provoke a war while all our western friends are away on vacation? Be sensible.\"</p>",
  "<p>Staff on the BBC World Service's new London-based Arabic television channel have voted to take strike action after the National Union of Journalists claimed the corporation was trying to run the service \"on the cheap\".</p> <p>Members of the NUJ working for BBC Arabic today voted 80.6% in favour of action - which also affects the World Service's Arabic radio and online services - on a turnout of 65%.</p> <p>The union has given the BBC until September 12 to respond to the ballot, otherwise it said \"serious and significant\" strike action would be launched.</p> <p>The NUJ broadcasting organiser, Paul McLaughlin, said too much work was being done in BBC Arabic by too few staff.</p> <p>\"The BBC wants to run the service on the cheap. If they want it done properly, then they have to pay the money,\" McLaughlin added.</p> <p>BBC World Service's Arabic TV channel only launched in March, but the NUJ said it was underfunded and branded plans to expand its broadcast hours from 12 to 24 a day from October as untenable on current budgets.</p> <p>The BBC's Arabic service, which costs \u00a340m a year, has a staff of around 250.</p> <p>Its radio and online outlets have a global audience of around 14 million a week. The BBC said it did not yet have viewing figures for the TV service.</p> <p>\"This is a towering result which proves to management how serious members' concerns are and how resolute they are to take action to pursue their just cause,\" McLaughlin said. </p> <p>\"In the light of the result we have invited management to return to the negotiating table and address our concerns. </p> <p>\"If management enter into talks in good faith, then matters can be resolved. If not, then members will meet after September 12 and table serious and significant strike action,\" he added.</p> <p>However, the BBC World Service said any strike action would be unjustified. \"We are disappointed with the results of the NUJ strike ballot at BBC Arabic, especially when a minority of the chapel refused to put our latest improved offer to the whole membership,\" the World Service said in a statement.</p> <p>\"This strike action is unjustified. We have responded positively and made proposals to a number of their concerns - including reduced night shifts and improved staffing at key times of the day,\" it added.</p> <p>\"BBC Arabic staff already have working conditions and rotas which are comparable with staff working on other news outlets in the BBC and our proposals, if they had been accepted, would have further enhanced their position. We note that the Bectu union, who were fully represented at the discussions, have decided not to take part in the ballot. </p> <p>\"We know the high esteem that audiences have for BBC Arabic across the Middle East and will take measures to ensure that all BBC Arabic programming and online services continue uninterrupted. The BBC is committed to finding a constructive way forward in dialogue with staff and is open to further discussion.\" </p> <p>In a note to staff in the BBC's Global News division, the World Service director, Nigel Chapman, said today that the corporation was withdrawing its \"generous package\" and would implement a 24-hour rota for staff working on the television channel.</p> <p>\"The local NUJ representatives claim that management have not responded to their demands. This is not true. We have offered a comprehensive package in response to detailed issues raised,\" Chapman wrote.</p> <p>He said the NUJ had asked for a 34-hour working week and wanted rotas to be designed \"in order to qualify radio staff for taxis home\". </p> <p>\"We cannot justify spending more than \u00a3650,000 of public money annually on taxis for people asking to work unusual shifts that do not match the production pattern we need to sustain,\" Chapman wrote. </p> <p>\"Their total demands - for extra staff and taxis - would cost \u00a31.5m per annum. As BBC World Service's funding is fixed for the next three years, this could only be funded by closing the equivalent of two BBC World Service language services.</p> <p>\"At \u00a340m per annum no one can seriously suggest that BBC Arabic is underfunded, especially when it has access to the BBC newsgathering and production infrastructure and can draw on the very considerable news resources elsewhere in the organisation. </p> <p>\"We acknowledge that there is some frustration in the service because many existing staff have been through a great deal of change in the last two years.\"</p> <p><em><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857.

Should we accept the effects of climate change and teach children to swim instead? Photograph: AP/Aftab Alam Siddiqui </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aftab Alam Siddiqui/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There's a Darwinian phrase that always seems to be closely associated with recession: you have to adapt to survive. But this is a phrase that now seems to be more closely associated with climate change than recession. </p> <p>In what seems like a flash, the climate-change debate has lurched from talk of mitigation to one of adaptation. This week alone we've had a high-profile discussion about whether we should now take very seriously the prospect of needing to turn to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2008/sep/01/climatechange.carbonemissions\">geoengineering to prevent dangerous climate change</a> \u2013 the equivalent of pushing all the chips onto black and crossing all your fingers and toes that the great roulette wheel in the sky looks upon us favourably. </p> <p>Just a year or so ago this would have been laughed out of town by the vast majority of environmentalists, climatologists and policy makers, let alone the wider public. And yet this week we've seen plenty of stroked chins and contemplative stares into the middle distance following mention of the subject by the Royal Society. \"Mmm, perhaps we do need to pour millions of tonnes of iron filings into the world's oceans, after all? By Jove, that just might do it.\" Who suddenly turned the desper'o'meter up to 11? Have we given up already on emission reductions targets?</p> <p>Another sign of the fast-shifting currents in this debate is the announcement yesterday of a new sort of <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/environmentNews/idUSLM65650620080902?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=environmentNews&amp;pageNumber=4&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0&amp;sp=true\">carbon-offsetting scheme</a>. My eyes normally tend to glaze over at such news given my long-held cynicism and distrust over both the motivation and net results of such initiatives, but this one was arresting for the simple reason of who is involved. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.neweconomics.org\">New Economics Foundation</a> (who recently launched the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/aug/01/climatechange.carbonemissions\">100 months campaign</a>) is teaming up with the <a href=\"http://www.iied.org/\">International Institute for Environment and Development</a> (IIED) to create a new offsetting scheme that focuses more on adaptation initiatives than ones centred on mitigation. In other words, it will aim to help those people in developing nations most at risk from climate change to adapt and survive, rather than solely help them to reduce their emissions in order to allow us to continue our polluting ways. In essence, it's a compensation payment for our role in messing up their world.</p> <p>\"This is very much not a minor absolution for your carbon sins, but is honestly a compensation payment for the impact you know your personal carbon emissions will have,\" says Andrew Simms, policy director at the NEF. </p> <p>It's a rather clever readjustment of the rules which represent a shift away from the rather cold, distant world of carbon calculators, tree-planting and handing out low-energy light bulbs to one in which a much more humane connection is made between the cause and effect. In principle, at least, it sounds like an improvement over the woeful offsetting schemes that exist today. </p> <p>However, I have a suspicion that it is likely to turn out to be a fruitless and convenient dance around the issues, just like the rest. Sorry, I'm just not convinced we should keep flogging this offsetting horse. I also shuddered when I read about one of the proposed pilot studies: to teach Indian children to swim \"so they can survive floods\". </p> <p>Sure, I completely accept that this is a very useful skill to learn wherever you happen to live, but are we really now entering an era in which people boarding a plane will feel comforted to know that their polluting journey will be directly contributing to the teaching of a child in Bihar how to survive the next time a flood strikes their state? It feels so wrong on so many levels.</p>",
  "<p><strong>IF YOU BACKED KEVIN KEEGAN TO BE THE FIRST MANAGER TO LEAVE THIS SEASON AT 1-100 START RUNNING THE WARM BATH NOW ... </strong></p> <p>Last night the Fiver had a cheese-fuelled dream in which it was given the death penalty for crimes against dignity. There were three options: lethal injection, special gas, or a sit-down with Alan Curbishley. Curbishley could even make a loyal dog run away out of boredom, and that lack of charisma means few 'ardcore 'Ammers fans will mourn his departure from Upton Park today.</p> <p>Frankly, though, who cares? For Curbishley was highly competent at his job, both at Charlton and West Ham, whom he saved from apparently certain relegation and then took to the safety of 10th place last season, at the worst a par finish given that most of his main signings were struck down in a freak bling accident.</p> <p>The goalposts, however, have since moved. According to the Fiver's Icelandic cousin, Sigur Ros \u00a315-a-pint Quite Cold Round Here Fiver, the West Ham owner Bjorgolfur Gudmundsson has been looking to cut costs all over the place and run the club propah. That meant the sale of Anton Ferdinand and George McCartney against Curbishley's will, after which his resignation was only a matter of time.</p> <p>Curbishley probably knew that nobody really wanted him to stay: the fans turned on him last week and, when he offered his resignation today, the resistance amounted to something like:</p> <p>\"Are you sure about this Alan?\" \"Well maybe we coul- \"OK then, don't forget to drop the keys in at reception. And I wouldn't put that Custard Cream anywhere unless you want to pay for it. Ta-ta bye-bye now!\"</p> <p>\"We can confirm that we have accepted Alan Curbishley's resignation as we feel it is in the best interests of both parties,\" oozed a West Ham statement. \"We wish Alan all the success in the future.\"</p> <p>And we wish West Ham fans all the luck in the world if they think Slaven Bilic is going to give up the Croatia job to take over Costcutter FC.

  "<p>Are sales of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/29/organic.food\">organic food dropping</a> as a result of the economic recession? Retail sales of organic food rose by 25-30% in 2006 and 2007 \u2013 worldwide, sales have grown by an average of 30% a year for 30 years. Some <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/29/organics.food1\">slowing down</a> of growth is certain this year, as with all food sales. But the picture varies \u2013 Asda has seen their fastest-ever growth in organic sales in the first six months of this year, mainly because they have made <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/14/ethicalliving.organics\">more organic products</a> available in their stores, and because they are attracting <a href=\" http://www.marketingweek.co.uk/cgi-bin/item.cgi?id=62024&amp;d=254&amp;h=260&amp;f=3\">more customers</a>. Waitrose say their organic sales are holding up. Half of our expenditure on food is now spent on eating out rather than in the supermarkets, and here organic sales are growing strongly. In the meantime, people buying organic fruit, veg, meat and other food through organic vegetable box schemes are enjoying the best-quality food at prices that are often the same or even lower than non-organic equivalents in the supermarkets. But farming and food is now the UK's largest industry actually producing goods rather than services, and all farmers and food manufacturers will suffer until the economy starts to recover. </p> <p>While this short-term slow down in the growth of organic food is inevitable, a more fundamental question is whether this is the start of a longer-term trend. Have organic sales reached some <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/29/organics.food\">natural limit</a>? Is organic simply a fad, an expensive indulgence for well-off Guardian readers? As my colleague and fellow organic farmer Helen Browning said in a Guardian <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/29/organics.food\">article</a> last week:</p> <blockquote> <p>Ethical shoppers are not just middle class faddists. The assumptions that those on less than middle incomes just don't care, can't be bothered, aren't interested in better food anymore, or the health of farm animals, or our environment, are hideously patronising and fundamentally flawed.</p> </blockquote> <p>So is the idea that organic farming a food is simply a \"niche\".</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.soilassociation.org/web/sa/saweb.nsf/848d689047cb466780256a6b00298980/f3a8098756cdfd73802574b9002d526c!OpenDocument\">Independent research</a> commissioned by the Soil Association and published this week shows that the production of organic combinable crops, such as wheat, barley and oil seed rape, could become more profitable compared to non-organic as the price of oil increases to $200 per barrel \u2013 predicted by a <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSL7232798&quot;\">recent Chatham House report</a> to happen in five to 10 years. The study by <a href=\"http://www.andersons.co.uk/research.htm\">Andersons</a>, the farm business consultants, shows that with oil at $200 per barrel, the gross margins of non-organic combinable crop systems range from \u00a3296 to \u00a3348, while the organic margins range from \u00a3371 to \u00a3411 (the net margins quoted do not include property and administrative costs, typically around \u00a3100-\u00a3175 per hectare, nor rent and finance costs, as these will vary significantly between farms). With oil at $135 per barrel (which it was when the analysis was done), the margins for organic and non-organic production of a combinable crops system show similar rates of return. The margins of non-organic combinable crop systems range from \u00a3397 to \u00a3449 and the organic margins range from \u00a3405 to \u00a3445. For rotations that include potatoes, non-organic systems are more profitable than organic with oil at $135 per barrel, and remain so with oil at $200, but the gap between the two systems narrows appreciably. The research is based on the arable rotations of actual farms Andersons' work with (we did not look at meat or diary in this study), and the costs and returns are based on current figures. </p> <p>The different impact of higher oil prices on organic and non-organic profits is mainly due to the high cost of artificial fertilisers \u2013 a fossil-fuel heavy industry \u2013 used in non-organic systems. As oil prices rise, the claimed economic efficiency of fossil fuel- and fertiliser-dependent industrial farming begins to decrease sharply. Organic farming does not use artificial chemical fertilisers, instead building soil fertility through crop rotations and particularly the use of clover that fixes nitrogen naturally from the atmosphere using the sun's energy. Clover can fix 200kg of nitrogen per hectare over a year. Due to rising input costs National Farmers' Union President Peter Kendell <a href=\"http://www.nfuonline.com/x28088.xml\">recently said</a>: \"Conventional farmers will have to think harder about rotations as ways of reducing fertiliser and pesticide input.\" Projections of the impact of future price changes are difficult. As prices change, so will the behaviour of people running farm businesses. In addition, as the costs of production change, at least in theory farmers should be able to command a higher price for their produce, but if that happens, higher prices are likely to affect consumer demand and maybe the level of imports, which will then feed back into changes in demand for primary products from farmers. As the price of oil and therefore nitrogen fertiliser rises, all farmers are likely to try and reduce their machinery use to save on fuel bills, and non-organic farmers are likely to try and apply nitrogen fertiliser and pesticides with greater care and precision than they might have done in the past. For the sake of this analysis, we have not assumed that other changes in farming practice would occur, or that prices for the crops studied would increase. </p> <p>Some other crucial factors have not been considered, such as the increasing scarcity of oil and in particular natural gas, currently used to manufacture artificial Nitrogen fertiliser. Not only are supplies likely to decline, much of our natural gas comes from Russia, and what supplies there are could hardly be described as secure. The study did not consider the impact of changes in demand, led by both increased food prices, and the public health drive to change diets to reduce the <a href=\"http://jech.bmj.com/cgi/content/abstract/59/12/1054\">\u00a36bn per annum</a> cost to the NHS and the UK economy caused by diet-related ill health. Both organic and conventional farmers will respond to rising costs of oil and (for non-organic) nitrogen fertiliser, and to changes in demand, to try and defend the profitability of their business. However, with all these qualifications in mind, the study does show that higher oil prices will have a more significant impact on non-organic farmers, and will move some organic systems into higher profitability than similar non-organic rotations. As oil inevitably becomes scarcer and costs more, economic forces will increasingly favour organic farming. Organic systems are not perfect, but they do use less energy, generally omit fewer greenhouse gases, can sequester carbon in the soil, provide more jobs and support more wildlife. This report suggests they could also offer a more secure long-term financial future for the UK's farmers.</p>",
  "<p>Sitting in an office in a small village just outside Cambridge may not have been where Deborah Cadman expected to be at this point in her career.<br>Nor does she exactly know where that career is heading. </p> <p>Cadman is the new chief executive of the East of England Development Agency, the quango responsible for fostering economic development in Bedfordshire, Essex, Hertfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Norfolk and Suffolk - counties with some very mixed economic fortunes. It's not the most obvious time to join a regional development agency: closer scrutiny of the RDAs is planned and if there is a change of government, some existing agencies could well be abolished. </p> <p>And though it may be in a business park, Cadman's office is still in a village, and Cadman, a Brummie by birth, though she has shed the accent along the way, is a self-confessed city girl - or was, until six years ago she became the chief executive of St Edmundsbury borough council, in the small town of Bury St Edmunds. </p> <p>But Cadman, now in her mid-40s, is laid back about the uncertainties that lie ahead and the path that has brought her to where she is today. \"I've never had a career plan,\" she says. \"My whole career is about taking advantage of opportunities. There is a risk that this job might go, but I've got 18 months to two years to demonstrate the value of what this organisation does.\" And, she might add, to demonstrate what she herself is bringing to the party. </p> <p>Cadman did a first degree in social administration and her early career was spent in a range of urban environments: the engineering department of the London borough of Newham; two years managing a voluntary sector project in Birmingham's Handsworth; a stint running major urban regeneration projects for Birmingham city council and then head of corporate policy at Redcar and Cleveland borough council. </p> <p>\"I guess my decision to go into public service was about wanting to work with communities,\" she says. It was also about putting theoretical learning into practice.</p> <p>During these years, Cadman also completed two masters degrees, one in urban studies, one in management, and had two children, a daughter and a son, now teenagers. </p> <p>She then took secondment into central government, working for the modernisation team at the then department of the environment, transport and the regions, so gaining a valuable insight into civil servants' perspective on local government. </p> <p>This was followed by a move to the Audit Commission, where Cadman was responsible for inspection in the London region and also worked with local authorities to develop sustainable improvement plans. </p> <p>In 2002 Cadman moved herself and her family to a village when she got the job as the chief executive of St Edmundsbury borough council. It was something of a revelation, of more than just rural delights: \"It has given me an appreciation that there is just as much poverty and deprivation in the countryside as in urban areas,\" she comments. </p> <p>Her own skills and focus are firmly on how organisations work and that will mean changes at EEDA, though she hasn't yet made her plans public. She is justifiably proud of having led St Edmundsbury from adequate to its present excellent rating from the Audit Commission. Her work in local government earned her an OBE in 2006. And she has now, in a highly unusual job transfer, handed the authority over to her husband, Geoff Rivers, who moves to the council from his former post as the chief executive of South Norfolk district council. </p> <p>So why did she want a job that might disappear in two years' time? \"I've worked in the region for six years and in St Edmundsbury I saw the tangible evidence of the role of EEDA in contributing to growth, so I had very positive feelings towards the agency,\" she says. The biggest immediate challenge comes not from the political environment but from the gathering economic gloom. </p> <p><strong>Advice</strong></p> <p>Cadman stresses that EEDA has anticipated the downturn and is well-placed to whip out and ply regional businesses with advice on things like how to cut their utility bills. <br>She's now dealing with a much smaller team - 240 staff, rather than the 680 at St Edmundsbury, but Cadman sees this as a chance to get closer to individual members of staff. </p> <p>She has many strengths and pauses when asked about any weaknesses, before confessing to impatience. That may be something she has to curb, in a job where there are, as Cadman acknowledges frankly, many causes for frustration. </p> <p>As an RDA, it has only a tiny fraction of direct budget to spend itself on services (\u00a3140m a year, when the overall regional spend on public services is some \u00a330bn), so much of Cadman's energy will be necessarily directed towards influencing and persuading those with more direct hands on the purse strings, in areas of high priority, such as education and skills in the region. She's frustrated, too, at what she sees as a lack of understanding, in terms of overall government policy, about the importance of creating jobs. As she looks across the mixed political and economic landscape of the east of England, Cadman says she intends to engage with all the politicians, to persuade them of the importance of the agency. </p> <p>As for being a working mother, in a household where both parents are high-profile public servants, Cadman acknowledges both the support of her husband and also the fact that something has to give. What falls off the edge, she says, is time for herself - keeping fit, for instance, is a mere dream. </p> <p>But there are ways and means to do some things, so she has solved the problem of keeping up with the reading for her book group by ensuring she has the works on CD, to listen to in the car.</p>",

  "<p>The Republican party hasn't just been winning presidential elections for most the past four decades, it's been winning the political conversation. From lavishly funded thinktanks like the <a href=\"http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Heritage_Foundation\">Heritage Foundation</a> to rightwing yakkers filling the airwaves, the Republicans have dominated the political conversation. The Republican convention this week will feature many of the key phrases that highlight the shift in America's politics. </p> <p>Here's a sampling to help you keep score: </p> <p><strong>Choice</strong><br>Although it's still part of the abortion debate (see <strong>pro-life</strong>), choice is also a Republican code word for privatisation, a term that got a bad name with President Bush's <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/18/politics/campaign/18social.html?fta=y&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;position=\">botched attempt to privatise social security</a>. It's also used for promoting private sector involvement in traditional government functions. Now Republicans talk about \"retirement choice\", \"Medicare choice\" or longstanding favourite \"school choice\". </p> <p><strong>Class warfare</strong><br>Progressive taxation was integral to America's income tax system from its origins, in line with a basic tenet of the American way of life, fairness to the little guy. When liberals controlled the conversation, they used the term <strong>economic justice</strong>. But then came Ronald Reagan. <strong>Reaganomics</strong> contended that lower taxes were more fair - government shouldn't penalise success, Reagan argued. Rather than squabbling over how to divide the pie, Republicans promised a bigger pie for all, without mentioning that haves would get an even larger share of the pie than have-nots.</p> <p>Reaganomics also promised that lower taxes would produce more revenue by spurring greater growth. Reagan's 1980 Republican primary rival, George Bush Sr, called it <strong>voodoo economics</strong> before he became Reagan's running mate. Reaganomics proved to be a dismal failure in fiscal terms, but its message that cutting taxes for the rich, like greed, is good stuck. Lower taxes on the rich are now presumed to spur economic growth. </p> <p>Contrary experience - recession under Reagan and his successor Bush Sr, America's <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/29/business/29tax.html\">growing income gap</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jan/05/oil.useconomy?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=networkfront\">jobless growth of the Bush years</a> that preceded the current stagflation - has not shaken this article of rightwing economic faith. Moreover, increasing the tax burden on the poor further excites Republicans because it supposedly dampens enthusiasm for government spending among the main beneficiaries, since they're footing the biggest portion of the bill.</p> <p>If you advocate progressive taxes - rather than accepting the emperor's new clothes view that Reaganomics works - you are engaging in class warfare. If you favour regressive taxes, you are promoting economic growth and helping the poor.</p> <p><strong>Death tax</strong><br>Rightwing anti-tax advocates recast the estate tax as the death tax and portrayed it as government's final insult against hardworking Americans. In truth, with estates up to $2m exempt from taxes, less 0.3% of US estates, representing the absolutely wealthiest Americans, pay any estate tax at all, according to United for a Fair Economy.</p> <p>Yet Republicans were able to turn the death tax into a grassroots rallying cry. They whined about forced sales of small businesses and family farms to pay estate taxes. They were <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/05/AR2006060501360.html\">never able to produce a single example</a> of such a forced sale, but that didn't stop them.</p> <p><strong>Hillarycare</strong><br>Americans get worse healthcare and pay more for it than citizens of other western industrialised nations. The reason is simple: America is the only western industrialised nation without some form of universal healthcare. While working people face choices between medicine or insurance and food or rent, Republicans are able to derail any serious debate, let alone progress, on universal healthcare with the magic word: Hillarycare.</p> <p>The phrase recalls Hillary Clinton's <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F03E3D71E39F93AA1575BC0A962958260&amp;scp=66&amp;sq=hillary+clinton+health+care&amp;st=nyt\">botched attempt to reform the system</a> early in Bill Clinton's presidency, still her most lasting legacy. Republicans use Hillarycare to conjure a healthcare system of limited choices, extraordinary expenses and poor outcomes, precisely what the US has today. </p> <p>The term can also be used to mock increasing government oversight in any area. Greater regulation of mortgage lenders in the wake of the subprime loan debacle would be <strong>Hillarycare for financial markets</strong>. </p> <p><strong>Hope</strong> vs <strong>Opportunity</strong><br>Democrats talk about hope and dreams. Republicans talk about opportunity and progress. Hopes and dreams are elusive and imprecise, like most Democratic messages. Opportunity and progress are more tangible and measurable, which mean that they can be taken away. Republicans claim that government is a barrier that takes away opportunities, when in fact if you are black, Hispanic, female, disabled or otherwise disadvantaged, the federal government is your guarantor of opportunity, mainly thanks to programmes and policies Democrats initiated. </p> <p><strong>Liberal</strong><br>Republicans have made liberal an indictment, not a legitimate viewpoint. If you are liberal, you are out of the <strong>mainstream</strong>. With two of the most liberal US senators on the Democratic presidential ticket, expect the L-word to fly early and often in St Paul.</p> <p><strong>Post-9/11 world</strong><br>To Republicans, living in a post-9/11 world justifies American unilateralism, including a pre-emptive war against a phantom enemy in Iraq, in the name of <strong>national security</strong>. In fact, the Bush administration's post-9/11 world strategy has made America less secure, converting global solidarity and goodwill to unprecedented levels of anti-Americanism, alienating allies and goading enemies into active hostility. Yet Democrats are portrayed as failing to understand the post-9/11 world.</p> <p><strong>Pro-Life</strong><br>When I cut my television news teeth at CNN in 1991, pro-life was up there on the forbidden list with <strong>foreign</strong> (Ted Turner was an early believer in the global village). The media had adopted the term pro-choice for abortion rights advocates, but no self-respecting news organisation used pro-life to describe foes of abortion rights.</p> <p>Pro-life held additional irony since anti-abortion zealots were bombing women's health clinics and shooting doctors. But under constant assault of anti-abortion forces and charges of liberal bias, the mainstream US media has been cowed into adopting pro-life as the standard term for opponents of abortion rights. Aside from the politics, it's an inane description: who this side of Josef Stalin isn't pro-life?</p> <p><strong>Working People</strong> vs <strong>Wealth</strong><br>Both parties say they're friends of working people. But Democrats often demonise wealth while seeking a common touch, and that's out of touch. Democrats still portray themselves as champions of the underdog. But in today's America, voters don't identify with Cinderella. They want to be Prince Charming. Republicans have convinced Americans to vote not their situations but their aspirations, while, as seen in Denver last week, Democrats have become increasingly unconvincing. As seen from the list above, Republicans don't need any kind of help to dominate discussions, or elections.</p>",
  "<p>Electricals retailer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/dsginternational\">DSG International</a> today posted a sharp fall in sales, led by a 12% decline at its PC World chain.</p> <p>Across the group, like-for-like sales fell 7% in the 16 weeks to August 23. Sales at Currys and Currys Digital - its electrical chain in the UK - were also down 7%. DSG's Elkjop stores in Scandinavia posted a 4% fall while southern Europe - Italy, Spain and Greece - suffered a 12% drop. Total sales, including new stores, were up 4%, benefiting from a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/currencies\">strengthening euro</a>.</p> <p>Shares in DSG dropped more than 6% on the news but later recovered to trade up 1.5p at 54.25p. They have lost two-thirds of their value over the past year.</p> <p>\"Overall this is a pretty dire trading update that highlights how tough things are out there, and ahead of the peak Christmas trading season,\" said Matthew McEachran at Kaupthing.</p> <p>Nick Bubb at Pali International forecast DSG would make a first-half loss.</p> <p>The figures were worse than the 4-8% fall predicted by the City. UBS had pencilled in a 4.5% fall in the UK, the basis of its \u00a3115m pretax profit forecast for the year, already below the \u00a3120-\u00a3130m consensus forecast in the City. Gross profit margins worsened by 0.75% on the year. </p> <p>\"We are not expecting a quick recovery,\" said chief executive John Browett. \"From what we can see from customers they are taking to heart the credit crunch and therefore I think it's going to be quite a while before we'll see anything from the market which helps us. Certainly we don't see any recovery this year or next year.\"</p> <p>Browett launched a strategic review in May, pledging to \"transform the DNA\" of the group by improving stores and customer service, developing the online business and cutting costs.</p> <p>DSG has slashed costs by \u00a350m and plans further savings of \u00a325m this year. The company is refitting its PC World and Currys stores in Britain and retraining 20,000 staff by Christmas. It also plans to bring a new large store format of 50,000 square feet, which has proved successful abroad, to the UK.<br> In Italy, it is closing loss making stores and trialling new formats for PC City within UniEuro stores. </p> <p>Freddie George at Seymour Pierce described the decline at PC World as \"alarming\" and reiterated his \"sell\" recommendation on the shares. He said he would downgrade his profit forecast of \u00a3155m. \"Poor results from the Italian operation and PC City in Spain confirm to us that the company is having difficulty selling these operations,\" he said. </p> <p>\"From our visit to see the new PC World format at Enfield it is clear that there are no easy answers on strategy for the UK business - PC World and Currys.\" He noted that in the new format at Enfield, which will be rolled out to the rest of the chain, the company has substantially increased the TV ranges and introduced cameras and music systems, thereby increasing overlap with Currys.</p> <p>Philip Dorgan at Panmure Gordon thinks profits will fall for the next two years. \"It is not just the consumer environment that is working against DSG \u2013 its problems are structural,\" he said. \"The business review attempts to tackle these issues, but we fear that it will take a very long time indeed to hit its margin targets.\" He noted, though, that the review had got off to a good start in terms of cost savings. <br> Analysts at Citi and Oriel Securities left their profit forecasts unchanged at \u00a3130m and \u00a3110.7m respectively.</p> <p>Ramona Tipnis at Oriel said: \"John Browett is ploughing through his strategic plan, determined to turn this business round. The plan is on track with new store formats, product and staff training lining up for the peak trading period.\"</p> <p>DSG's chairman John Collins is to retire after next year's annual meeting.</p>",
  "<p>Bravery is essential in Pakistani politics. The attempted assassination today of its prime minister, Yousaf Raza Gilani, is just the latest instance of violence in the country's bloody 60-year history.</p> <p>Numerous political figures have died in violent circumstances, from the former prime minister Liaquat Ali Khan, who was shot dead in 1951, to the dictator General Zia ul-Haq, who was killed in a mysterious plane crash in 1988.</p> <p>In December 2007, the former prime minister Benazir Bhutto was assassinated at an election rally, a few weeks after a failed assassination attempt on her killed more 130 people.</p> <p>Of Bhutto's immediate family, only her mother has escaped a violent death. Her father, Zulifkar Ali, another former prime minister of Pakistan, was hanged by General Zia. One of her brothers, Shah Nawaz, was poisoned in mysterious circumstances in 1985 in France. Her other brother, Murtaza, was shot in a Karachi street by an unknown assassin.</p> <p>Pakistan's military and security forces are widely assumed to be behind many such killings. But such questions are rarely answered in Pakistan. The establishment tends to blame terrorists.</p> <p>As the Pakistani daily newspaper the News said following Benazir Bhutto's assassination: \"The fact that almost all the past political assassinations and unusual deaths in Pakistan's history - including those of Liaquat Ali Khan, Hayat Ahmed Sherpao, General Zia, Murtaza Bhutto and Omar Asghar Khan - remain shrouded in mystery provides little assurance that questions surrounding this killing will be satisfactorily answered.\"</p> <p>The former president General Pervez Musharraf survived several assassination attempts, notably in 2003 and 2007. Extremists, rather than the military, are thought to have been involved. The survival of the general illustrates one of the suspected traits of Pakistani violence - Islamists tend to miss their targets, but the military does not.</p> <p>The continuing bloodshed illustrates the power of anti-democratic forces in Pakistan, including the military, extremists, and the clergy.</p> <p>The leftwing Pakistani commentator Tariq Ali suggests the violence will continue while the military remains powerful and Pakistan's leadership continues to make unpopular global allies, such as the US.</p>",
  "<p>\"I'm pleased we are not in an Alcatel-Lucent situation,\" laughs Francois Bertreau, the chief executive of French transport and logistics group Norbert Dentressangle (GND), in his first British interview since masterminding the integration of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/oct/03/3 \">venerable UK rival Christian Salvesen</a> (CS), bought for \u00a3254m last October.</p> <p>He became the chief executive on July 24 and has ambitious plans to expand the presence of the vermilion trucks increasingly spotted on British motorways and, eventually, take the Lyon-based firm, founded only in 1979, global. \"With Salvesen we are third or fourth in Europe and truly European, with 45% of our business outside France compared with 21% before,\" he says.</p> <p>Bertreau, who insists on speaking English (well), says the process of integrating CS has been \"smooth and efficient\". This is in sharp contrast to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/02/telecoms.europe\">the deep cultural differences that have beset Alcatel-Lucent</a> (the much larger Franco-American IT group that appointed a new chairman and chief executive this week) in the two years of heavy losses since its merger.</p> <p>The 53-year-old executive says CS had been organised along much the same lines as GND, divided into transport and logistics, and, especially at middle-management level, equally dedicated to operations and serving customers. \"We were very cautious about not overwhelming CS people, telling them the right way to do things,\" says Bertreau.</p> <p>Last week the acquisition delivered its first fruits, showing that GNG has doubled in size as a result of the takeover. Sales in the first half rose 83% to \u20ac1.6bn (\u00a31.3bn) or the same as in the whole of 2006, with recurrent operating income up 46% to \u20ac46.3m. Bertreau reaffirmed targets of 6-8% organic growth and improved profits this year and of \u20ac25m cost savings from 2009.</p> <p>But the acquisition came with a cost: a rise in gearing from around 30% to 174%, with net debt at \u20ac594m, of which \u20ac356m is CS-related. Net income was down because of interest and fees and there were restructuring costs of \u20ac6.6m. But the latter could have been worse for the group, which employs just under 30,000 now. Barely 100 CS staff among the 13,000 taken over have lost their jobs, with another 150 going as GND shuts three British depots already earmarked for closure by CS.</p> <p>Bertreau points out that the deal, financed mainly by debt and a small amount of cash, did not involve any rights issue. \"It's a big operation and we have a cross to bear,\" he admits. \"Our objective over the next 12 to 18 months is to fully integrate CS so it makes a positive contribution to the balance-sheet ... It will take more time to cut the debt.\"</p> <p>He makes plain that any further acquisitions in the near term will be small fry but his goal is to bulk up GND to a worldwide logistics group. \"I am really trying to think about worldwide development over the next five years. The next stage is to go from a European company to a global one,\" he adds, conceding the founder chairman and majority owner will have the final say.</p> <p>Bertreau appears sanguine about the worsening economic climate and rising fuel prices, saying the latter have been passed on to credit-wary customers. Growing regulatory pressures, including at EU level to combat climate change, leave him unfazed.</p> <p>\"We're a transport company not a trucking company,\" he says. \"We're just using trucks because they're a better, more efficient means of transport, particularly for our super- and hypermarket clients. We're using other modes of transport: railways when they're useful or rivers/canals. But the idea that trucks are no longer acceptable and we should get rid of them does not wash.\"</p> <p>He adds: \"We're trying to deal with the trucking problem in terms of pollution, fuel consumption and safety.\" Half of the fleet of 8,500 trucks, he says, meet tough EU standards on emissions and fuel consumption is being reduced by a shift to alternative fuels and tyres. Accidents are down to one per 550,000km.</p> <p>His priority, as Europe's transport and logistics sector consolidates even more, is clear. \"Our goal is to grow the group. We don't want to stop now.\"</p> <h2>Name a figure</h2> <p>\"I guess you won't give a figure but what are the new provisions?\" asked one French analyst. \"How much above \u20ac1bn? Can we have a ball-park figure?\" asked another. Anne Lauvergeon, chief executive of Areva, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/nuclear \">the world's biggest maker of nuclear reactors</a>, simply blanked them.</p> <p>The silence about Areva's exposure to cost overruns at the first new-generation EPR power plant it is building with EDF and Siemens at Olkiluoto, Finland, is deafening. This is more than maddening: it's politically self-defeating as Europe seeks to reduce its energy dependence on freshly belligerent Russia via a nuclear renaissance inter alia.</p> <p>Lauvergeon has said the world will build up to 400 new nuclear reactors up to 2030 and Areva wants to take on a third of these. But, with public resistance to new build still powerful in key EU countries, clarity about costs (as well as safety and waste) is essential. But none came at her lengthy presentation of state-owned Areva's half-year results, which took place on Friday evening last week, after the markets had closed and most people had gone home for the weekend.</p> <p>Les Echos, the French financial daily, has reported, without getting a notable denial, that the cost of the Finnish plant (OL3) has risen by a half on the original \u20ac3bn to \u20ac4.5bn - and Areva is responsible for the bulk of this, probably more than \u20ac1bn now.</p> <p>It's the third time the group, keen to build several of Britain's planned new nuclear power plants and involved in the first French EPR at Flamanville on the Normandy coast and two in China, has taken a provision on OL3 without naming it. The relevant division (reactors and services) had an operating loss of \u20ac258m in the first half, up from one of \u20ac230m a year ago, as a consequence.</p> <p>All we know from Lauvergeon and her team is that \"additional resources\" were mobilised at the Finnish site to begin installation operations which are two years behind schedule and a spate of new measures have been introduced to speed the work up, including a new team of engineers. It's speculated that, as well as higher materials and equipment costs, this has brought a higher salaries bill. And Areva has gone to arbitration with TVO, its Finnish customer, over sharing the costs.</p> <p>In all this fog only one thing is certain: Areva's overall profits in the first half reached a new record of \u20ac760m net, up \u20ac465m on a year earlier. Guess that makes everything ok.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/sep/02/google.microsoft\">Google's dramatic entry</a> yesterday into the <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/digitalcontent/2008/09/google_joins_the_browser_wars.html\">world of browsers</a> \u2013 the software that navigates us around the web \u2013 can be regarded in two ways: open war against Microsoft, which has over 70% of the global market for browsers \u2013 and a much more vital 90% of the operating systems that run computers \u2013 or Google's philanthropy to the rest of the world to promote wider usage of the web. And the rest of the world, of course, includes arch-rival Microsoft which, like other browser creators such as <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/\">Firefox</a> (20%) and Apple's <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/safari/\">Safari</a> (6% and rising) can make use of its impressive innovations because they are based on open standards not proprietary software.</p> <p>The truth lies somewhere in between but either way it raises uncomfortable questions about Google's increasing dominance of the web. </p> <p>The new browser, called <a href=\"http://www.google.com/chrome/\">Chrome</a>, is certainly a gift in that, like all of Google's other consumer products, no charge is made. Google makes its money from advertising and, to a lesser extent, from corporate deals. So the more the web is used the more money it gets from its search advertising. It is in danger of building up one of the most dangerous monopolies of all time \u2013 control of most of the information we deal in including our secret web lives. And yet, it is totally innocent of the charge that defines traditional monopolies \u2013 that they exploit their monopoly positions by overcharging consumers \u2013 because it doesn't charge at all.</p> <p>After playing around with it for a few hours one can say it certainly does what Google claims giving faster, cleaner and more reliable access the web with some snazzy innovations. I have switched to it as the default browser on my Windows PC (it is not available for Macs yet).</p> <p>So, another success for Google \u2013 and that's the problem. The company is like a friendly octopus that is gradually wrapping its tentacles around you. It started with search and Google now has around 75% of the global market. In theory this is the flimsiest monopoly of all because you only need to type \"Yahoo\" (almost indistinguishable in quality from Google's search) into Chrome's search box to escape, but it is not that easy. I recently changed my default search engine to <a href=\"http://clusty.com/\">clusty.com</a> as an experiment because it has some interesting features such as a dedicated Shakespeare search engine and an option to search through clouds of tags. But the experience usually lasts 45 seconds because as soon as one navigates to other pages, Google search boxes become ubiquitous and you can't be bothered go back to the default one.</p> <p>One by one, Google's tentacles have entangled me: news, its documents feature (I write practically everything on this service because it is automatically saved on the web so you can work from any computer), maps, gmail, <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/\">YouTube</a>, the admirable book search plus blogs. It recently tried unsuccessfully to lure me away from <a href=\"http://secondlife.com/\">Second Life</a> with a virtual world of its own <a href=\"http://www.lively.com\">Google Lively</a> for Windows only, and the very cool recent improvements to its <a href=\"http://picasa.google.com\">Picasa</a> photo hosting site, such as doing visual searches on faces in photos, nearly made me think of dropping my beloved <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com\">Flickr</a>.</p> <p>It is in this context that the Chrome browser must be seen. Its improvements, some borrowed from smaller browsers such as the innovative <a href=\"http://www.opera.com/\">Opera</a>, may have difficulty making inroads into Internet Explorer's 72% market share simply because the Microsoft offering, much improved since it has had to face real competition from Firefox, is embedded in most PCs when they leave the factory and typical users won't bother to change out of inertia. Google won't lose too much sleep because its real objective is to lure individuals and corporations away from Windows on the desktop and on to the web where Google hosts all its applications including search, videos and gmail.</p> <p>That, increasingly, will be the problem. Google's ability to use the success of its search engine to lure users to embrace all the other features that it is progressively improving will make it a one-shop stop for most people using the internet. If Google is eventually successful in cornering a larger share of the browsing market on top of what it knows about our search, video, writing and reading habits, it will know more about us than is healthy for any organisation private or public to be vested with. And it will be difficult for new start-ups to provide fresh competition. </p> <p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_Richelieu\">Cardinal Richelieu </a>once said that if you gave him 10 sentences written by the most honest man he would find something in them to hang him for. Google could do that in a fraction of a second. If Google were publicly owned, it would render the FBI and MI5 redundant. It is only because Google has more-or-less kept to its mission statement \"Don't be evil\" (well, outside of China, where it partially caved in to government censorship) that it hasn't generated widespread suspicion. As it, remorselessly, gets ever bigger and more pervasive, the corrupting influence of power could be felt more. And who knows what will happen decades ahead when the present , public-spirited owners have moved on?</p> <p>That said, the browser itself will bring much-needed competition to the market. Chrome has a deceptively simple interface that hides a lot of hot features. A single box at the top combines the role of search engine and URL slot so if you type something in it will immediately recognise whether you are looking for a web address (URL) or just searching. It will make suggestions if it thinks you have made a typo though, curiously, while it suggested the proper spelling of my name when I typed in \"Victor Kegan\", it failed to recognise \"crome\" as a misspelling of the name of its own browser. It will learn quickly. </p> <p>The \"tabs\" at the top enabling you to work on multiple sites at once are not linked so when one tab crashes the others don't follow it. Also, you can drag a tag down the screen and it becomes a window. The speed at which it works \u2013 thanks largely to the way it has made Java (the software that is ubiquitous on the web) perform much faster is very impressive and the \"incognito\" feature that enables you to leave no footprints on sites you visit is bound to be particularly popular with the erotica market which is hugely popular on thde web, if rarely written about.</p> <p>It is difficult to feel sorry for Microsoft which has battled by fair means and foul to maintain its hugely lucrative 90% monopoly of operating systems now being attacked in a pincer movement by the revival of Apple and a migration of individuals from the desktop to the web, lured by the siren sounds of Google. How long it will take for corporations to follow suit is anyone's guess, not least because the cost of shifting from an embedded system is huge. Some comparisons show that Microsoft recently increased its market share slightly.</p> <p>Microsoft, however, has every reason to be worried. The danger is that we will be exchanging one form of monopoly for another one that will eventually have more power over us than Microsoft could ever dream of.</p>",
  "<p>I've heard it before, but there's a particularly good version of it in <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/79320788-794e-11dd-9d0c-000077b07658.html?nclick_check=1\">Sue Cameron's column in the FT today</a> \u2013 the theory that politicians ultimately fail not because of what they are bad at, but because of what they are good at.</p> <p>She attributes it to Peter Hennessy, the doyen of contemporary historians. I'm sure other people have thought of this too, but Hennessy's an inspiration to anyone who studies modern politics, so I can't begrudge him taking the credit.</p> <blockquote> <p>Professor Hennessy says PMs often fail in the very areas where they have expertise: Eden, the foreign affairs expert, faced Suez; Callaghan, son of the Labour movement, had the winter of discontent; Thatcher, champion of the ratepayers, came to grief over poll tax. Will the economy prove Mr Brown's nemesis?</p> </blockquote> <p>It's a good thesis, and there are other names you could add to the list:</p> <p>Tony Blair \u2013 who came to power partly because he was brilliant at handling the media, but who was subsequently derided for being obsessed with spin.</p> <p>John Major \u2013 who was applauded as a consensus politician when he replaced Thatcher, but who ultimately presided over a massive party split.</p> <p>(A ministerial colleague of Major's once told me: \"When he became prime minister, we thought he would be good for the party but not so good for the country. In fact it turned out the other way round.\" Quite a neat verdict.)</p> <p>There must be others. Can you think of any more?</p> <p>The theory actually seems to cover two categories of failure: politicians who are rightly acclaimed for their expertise in an area, and who then muck up fantastically (like Eden), and politicians who are acclaimed for a particular skill, but who then find, as the world changes, that what used to be perceived as a positive becomes perceived as a negative (like Blair).</p> <p>Brown's situation seems to combine a bit of both. He's made economic mistakes, particularly over scrapping the 10p tax band, as he's admitted. </p> <p>But I suspect that his real problem is that, at a time when he was only part-responsible for what seemed like never-ending growth (the rest of it, frankly, was global economics and luck), he was happy to take 100% of the credit. Now, in a downturn over which he has precious little control, he's getting 100% of the blame.</p> <p>Incidentally, Hennessy has also told Cameron that he does not have a lot of faith in the ability of Brown's staff to help him recover.</p> <blockquote> <p>'If you think this lot have a Baldrick-style cunning plan you are flattering them,' says Professor Peter Hennessy of London University. 'A lot of the people in No 10 - notably the spads or special advisers - aren't house-trained. They don't know what everyone is meant to be doing.'</p> </blockquote> <p>.</p>",

  "<p>The French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, and US secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, are visiting former pariah Arab states this week, signifying a thawing of relations that the west hopes will yield significant results.</p> <p>Sarkozy is meeting President Bashar al-Assad today in the first official visit by a western leader to Syria for more than three years. And on Friday Rice will become the first US secretary of state to travel to Libya in more than half a century.</p> <p>While the US and other western and Arab governments still shun Assad, Sarkozy has responded to Syria's recent indirect peace talks with Israel and its support for reconciliation in Lebanon.</p> <p>\"The moment that Syria renews ties, through France, with Europe, maybe with the west, and we hope with its Arab environment, then one can imagine that evolutions will become possible,\" a French official close to Sarkozy told Reuters.</p> <p>He said Sarkozy would ask Assad to use its ties with Tehran to try to end Iran's standoff with the west over its nuclear programme, which the US and others claim is geared towards developing weapons of mass destruction. Iran insists the programme is peaceful.</p> <p>But the official added that France was not asking Syria to distance itself from Tehran. Israel is believed to be trying to engineer a schism between Syria and Iran, as well as Islamist groups Hizbullah and Hamas, by wooing Assad.</p> <p>Sarkozy is the first western head of government to visit Damascus since the 2005 assassination of the Lebanese statesman Rafik al-Hariri, which was blamed on Syria, which then had a military presence in Lebanon.</p> <p>Paris suspended diplomatic contacts with Damascus last year after it accused the government of blocking Lebanon's presidential election. When Syria subsequently helped resolve the political stalemate it opened the way for renewed contacts with France.</p> <p>Peace talks with Israel are likely to be near the top of the agenda when Sarkozy and Assad meet the Turkish prime minister, Recip Tayyip Erdogan, and Qatar's emir, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani.</p> <p>Syria has said it is open to direct talks with Israel but only after a new US administration takes office next year. US-brokered direct negotiations collapsed in 2000 over the extent of Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights. Syria's foreign minister said recently the indirect talks were focusing on the same sticking point.</p> <p>Rice begins a four-nation tour of North Africa in Tripoli on Friday, meeting the Libyan leader, Muammar Gadafy, and other top officials in what the US state department called a \"historic stop\".</p> <p>\"In that period of time, we've had a man land on the moon, the internet, the Berlin Wall fall, and we've had 10 US presidents,\" said the state department spokesman Sean McCormack.</p> <p>The two countries are working on a bilateral trade and investment deal to boost commerce that may be completed in time for Rice's arrival, officials said.<br> Libya's proven oil reserves are the ninth largest in the world, close to 39 billion barrels, and vast areas remain unexplored for new deposits.</p> <p>Libya has come in from the cold in terms of its relationship with the US since it abandoned its weapons of mass destruction programmes and renounced terror in 2003.</p> <p>It also began moves to compensate the victims of Libyan-linked attacks, most notably the 1988 Pan Am 103 bombing over <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/lockerbie\">Lockerbie</a>, Scotland, which killed 269 passengers and crew.</p> <p>Last month a settlement scheme with the US was finally reached, although Libya has yet to put cash into the humanitarian fund as agreed.</p> <p>In an unsubtle message to Iran and others, McCormack said: \"Libya is an example that if countries make a different set of choices than they are making currently, they can have a different kind of relationship with the United States.\"</p> <p>Rice will also visit Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco and stop over in Lisbon, Portugal, before returning to Washington on Sunday.</p>",

  "<p>The pressure on the Bank of England intensified today as it began its two-day meeting to set <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/interestrates\">interest rates</a> as food inflation continued to rise and Britain's services sector shrank for a fourth consecutive month.</p> <p>The bank's monetary policy committee is expected to leave <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/interestrates\">rates</a> unchanged at 5% tomorrow but the growing fears of a UK recession mean that some analysts now expect a cut before Christmas. </p> <p>Latest figures on the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/creditcrunch\">cost of goods</a> in the shops, released this morning, showed that food prices in the UK soared 10% in the year to August as retailers continue to pass on rising costs.</p> <p>The British Retail Consortium (BRC) shop price deflator said that overall prices rose 3.8% in the year to August, up from 3.2% in July and 1.2% in April.</p> <p>Mike Watkins at Nielsen, which helps compile the survey, said: \"Shop price inflation is likely to continue through the autumn but we are hopeful that the acceleration in cost prices that has driven food prices up so sharply is starting to slow.\"</p> <p>Analysts said that the rise in high street prices may encourage the hawks on the MPC in their determination to throttle inflationary pressures, making a rate cut on Thursday unlikely.</p> <p>\"The further sharp rise in the shop price deflator in August is not good news for the Bank of England,\" commented Howard Archer at Global Insight.</p> <p>\"The marked jump in shop prices in August reinforces belief that the Bank of England will hold interest rates at 5% on Thursday, despite the ever growing likelihood of recession. While we now expect the Bank of England to cut interest rates before the end of 2008, we believe that it will not move before November when there is likely to be growing evidence that the deepening economic slowdown, markedly weaker consumer spending and rising unemployment is diluting underlying inflationary pressures,\" Archer predicted.</p> <p>Archer expects rates to fall to 3.50% in 2009. But David Blanchflower, the most dovelike member of the committee, believes the weakening state of the UK economy means rates should be cut now. </p> <h2>Bottoming out?</h2> <p>With the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development now expecting Britain to fall into a recession, the latest services data gave some indication that the sector's decline may be bottoming out with inflationary pressures receding.</p> <p>The Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply/Markit monthly index, which measures services activity, unexpectedly rose to 49.2 last month from 47.4 in July - just below the 50 point that marks the cut-off between contraction and expansion. City economists had expected a further worsening to 47.</p> <p>The improvement suggests the slump in the service industries - from cafes to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/telecoms\">telecoms</a> - may have bottomed out.</p> <p>\"It's a surprise,\" said George Buckley at Deutsche Bank. \"The index has now risen for two months in a row. I'm still not convinced that it's the start of a recovery but it's surprising nonetheless.\"</p> <p>New orders in the sector, which makes up <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics\">three-quarters of the economy</a>, continued to decline but showed their first improvement since February. The index rose to 47.1 from a series low of 44.7 in July.</p> <p>Alan Clarke at BNP Paribas thought the improvement could partly be put down to lower <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/oil\">oil prices</a>, adding that it takes \"some of the urgency away from cutting interest rates in the immediate future\".</p> <p>Inflationary pressures cooled, with the index measuring prices charged by companies falling to 55.2, the lowest reading since April. Firms' costs rose at the slowest rate since March, with the index dropping to 66.8 from 70.2. This will bring some relief to the Bank of England, worried that headline inflation is, at 4.4%, running at more than twice its target of 2%.</p> <p>Businesses have become more optimistic, indicated by the first improvement in the business expectations index since February - to 61 from 56.1.</p>",

  "<p>Terry Leahy makes great play of reducing Tesco's \"carbon intensity,\" but any climate scientist will tell you that it's absolute, real emissions that count. If your efficiency improves but your total emissions go up you're back to square one, it's gallons that matter more than miles-per-gallon. </p> <p>What is needed? The Tyndall Centre on Climate Change Research says that the UK will need to hit absolute emissions reductions of between 6% to 9% annually, if we are to play our part in a realistic global climate deal. </p> <p>Tesco should adopt this target for its own business, including fuel for its vehicles, the emissions that stem from all the stores supporting logistics and, vitally, emissions from the transport its customers use to shop at Tesco's out of town stores. Tesco's biggest weakness is its basic business model that largely depends on customers' use of private cars. </p> <p>Their future growth model is based on ever more giant out-of-town hypermarkets feeding sprawling suburbs \u2013 copying a Wal-Mart style approach that in the US has created what are called \"dead zones\". This is the kind of locked-in fossil-fuel dependence that needs breaking. Even if Tesco do end up halving their energy use per square foot, City analysts suggest that they have the assets to double their shop floor space in the UK.</p> <p>Tesco also make a big deal of cutting plastic bag use, but their marginal achievements are ridiculed, somewhat, by the city of New Delhi and the country of Bangladesh, where plastic bags have been phased out completely. Why can't Tesco do the same?</p> <p>There is something which might be an acid test of Tesco's commitment to sustainability. Environmentally speaking, in the UK we live beyond our means, consuming at a level that would require at least three planets to sustain.</p> <p>Consuming less is as important as consuming differently. <a href=\"http://www.wrap.org.uk/\">Wrap</a>, the government-sponsored agency whose aim is to cut the waste of resources, estimates that we end up throwing away one bag in three of all the food we buy. </p> <p>Instead of cajoling us to over-consume with buy-one-get-one-free offers, Tesco should have notices at check-outs suggesting that customers think really hard about what's in their trolleys, and to put one third back on the shelves.</p> <p>It's easy for a company to create the impression of being green. All it has to do is have some green initiatives. But it's almost impossible for the general public to tell whether the action is remotely adequate or sufficient.

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.adbusters.org/\">Adbusters</a>, the journal of the anti-consumerist movement, has been a bit down in the dumps in recent years. A strained voice in the wilderness calling for <a href=\"http://www.artmovements.co.uk/situationism.htm\">situationist</a>-style actions, hoping to change the world with \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subvertising\">subvertisements</a>\", its beloved global justice movement has dissipated to the four winds. And now a scapegoat has been found for its demise: <a href=\"http://www.adbusters.org/magazine/79/hipster.html\">hipsters</a>. The cover story this month declares that the current generation of the young and the trendy are responsible for destroying \"the counterculture\":</p> <blockquote> <p>An amalgamation of its own history, the youth of the west are left with consuming cool rather that creating it \u2026 The hipster represents the end of western civilisation \u2013 a culture so detached and disconnected that it has stopped giving birth to anything new.</p> </blockquote> <p>\"Hipster\" is a word with more currency in the US, but even on this side of the Atlantic it represents a definable type (even if they're more often called scenesters or fashionistas, or some derivative of the TV show <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhAr_UeroCk\">Nathan Barley</a>). A hipster is young, fashionable, takes a surface interest in any number of fleetingly popular subcultures, objects or media \u2013 from an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuduro\">African dance music</a> genre to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2008/mar/09/green\">fixed-gear bikes</a> \u2013 and then hastily moves on to \"the new thing\" before the masses have a chance to catch up.</p> <p>The central accusation in the Adbusters piece is that hipsters are devoid of integrity: that they never truly engage with any of the cultural trends they pay lip-service to, that they're an advertising demographic rather than a \"movement\", and that they are glibly ironic about everything. But really they're just fashion people, and it seems churlish to attack them just for behaving like fashion people always have done. Gavin McInnes, one of the founders of international hipster bible <a href=\" http://vice.typepad.com/\">Vice</a> magazine, wasn't shy of telling Adbusters to lighten up: </p> <blockquote> <p>I've always found that word ('hipster') is used with such disdain, like it's always used by chubby bloggers who aren't getting laid anymore and are bored, and they're just so mad at these young kids for going out and getting wasted and having fun and being fashionable.</p> </blockquote> <p>Vice can sometimes sail dangerously close to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_OirA3zGNw\">parody</a>, but it also exposes the myth that hipsters are necessarily shallow dilettantes. Vice UK has had a long and supportive relationship with London's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grime_(music)\">grime</a> scene, which is more than you can say for the British music industry. The hipster bars and the grime scene's council estates are neighbours in London's East End \u2013 and Vice have long been putting on grime acts at their Shoreditch pub venue and covering them in the print magazine. The point is, this is more than merely aloof cultural dabbling.</p> <p>In the information age, young people's interests and tastes have atomised: as a teenager in 21st-century Britain you can devote all your cultural enthusiasm to Japanese punk, South American sport, or Iranian films if you so wish. Mass-grouped tribal rebellion against a conservative cultural elite isn't necessary when you are free to plough the furrow of your choice.</p> <p>And when specific subcultures <em>are</em> cherry-picked for a season of hipster co-option, it rarely does them serious damage. The hipster eye will quickly turn to something new, shoulders are shrugged, and the artists or musicians or film-makers carry on doing what they were doing in the first place. \"Hipsters\" are just fashion people being fashion people, and perhaps the magazine of the global justice movement ought to look a little closer to home to explain the demise of its counterculture.</p>",
  "<p>Thank you for that warm welcome. I am honoured to be here. </p> <p>We meet tonight in the wake of a terrible storm that has hit the gulf coast but that hurts all of us, because we are all members of our larger American family. </p> <p>At times like this, we set aside all that divides us, and we come together to help our fellow citizens in need. </p> <p>What matters is certainly not whether we are Democrats or Republicans, but that we are all Americans. </p> <p>The truth is, it shouldn't take a hurricane to bring us together like this. </p> <p>Every day, across our country, millions of our fellow citizens are facing huge problems. </p> <p>They are worried about their homes, their jobs and their businesses; they are worried about the outrageous cost of gas and of health insurance; and they are worried about the threats from our enemies abroad. </p> <p>But when they look to Washington, all too often they do not see their leaders coming together to tackle these problems. </p> <p>Instead they see Democrats and Republicans fighting each other, rather than fighting for the American people. </p> <p>Our founding fathers foresaw the danger of this kind of senseless partisanship. George Washington himself - in his farewell address to our country - warned that the \"spirit of party\" is \"the worst enemy\" of our democracy and \"enfeebles\" our government's ability to do its job. </p> <p>George Washington was absolutely right. The sad truth is - today we are living through his worst nightmare, in the capital city that bears his name. </p> <p>And that brings me directly to why I am here tonight. What, after all, is a Democrat like me doing at a Republican convention like this? </p> <p>The answer is simple. </p> <p>I'm here to support John McCain because country matters more than party. </p> <p>I'm here tonight because John McCain is the best choice to bring our country together and lead our country forward. </p> <p>I'm here because John McCain's whole life testifies to a great truth: being a Democrat or a Republican is important. </p> <p>But it is not more important than being an American. </p> <p>Both presidential candidates this year talk about changing the culture of Washington, about breaking through the partisan gridlock and special interests that are poisoning our politics. </p> <p>But only one of them has actually done it. </p> <p>Only one leader has shown the courage and the capability to rise above the smallness of our politics to get big things done for our country and our people. </p> <p>And that leader is John McCain! </p> <p>John understands that it shouldn't take a natural disaster like Hurricane Gustav to get us to take off our partisan blinders and work together to get things done. </p> <p>It shouldn't take a natural disaster to teach us that the American people don't care much if you have an \"r\" or a \"d\" after your name. </p> <p>What they care about is, are we solving the problems they are up against every day? </p> <p>What you can expect from John McCain as president is precisely what he has done this week: which is to put country first. That is the code by which he has lived his entire life, and that is the code he will carry with him into the White House. </p> <p>I have personally seen John, over and over again, bring people together from both parties to tackle our toughest problems we face - to reform our campaign finance, lobbying and ethics laws, to create the 9/11 Commission and pass its critical national security reforms, and to end the partisan paralysis over judicial confirmations. </p> <p>My Democratic friends know all about John's record of independence and accomplishment. </p> <p>Maybe that's why some of them are spending so much time and so much money trying to convince voters that John McCain is someone else. </p> <p>I'm here, as a Democrat myself, to tell you: don't be fooled. </p> <p>God only made one John McCain, and he is his own man. </p> <p>If John McCain was just another go-along partisan politician, he never would have taken on corrupt Republican lobbyists, or big corporations that were cheating the American people, or powerful colleagues in Congress who were wasting taxpayer money. </p> <p>But he did! </p> <p>If John McCain was just another go-along partisan politician, he never would have led the fight to fix our broken immigration system or to do something about global warming. </p> <p>But he did! </p> <p>As a matter of fact, if John McCain is just another partisan Republican, then I'm Michael Moore's favorite Democrat. </p> <p>And I'm not. </p> <p>Senator Obama is a gifted and eloquent young man who can do great things for our country in the years ahead. But eloquence is no substitute for a record - not in these tough times. </p> <p>In the Senate he has not reached across party lines to get anything significant done, nor has he been willing to take on powerful interest groups in the Democratic party. </p> <p>Contrast that to John McCain's record, or the record of the last Democratic president, Bill Clinton, who stood up to some of those same Democratic interest groups and worked with Republicans to get important things done like welfare reform, free trade agreements and a balanced budget. </p> <p>Governor Sarah Palin, like John McCain, is a reformer who has taken on the special interests and reached across party lines. She is a leader we can count on to help John shake up Washington. </p> <p>That's why the McCain-Palin ticket is the real ticket for change this year. </p> <p>The Washington bureaucrats and power brokers can't build a pen strong enough to hold these two mavericks. </p> <p>And together, you can count on John McCain and Sarah Palin to fight for America and to fight for you! And that's what our country needs most right now. </p> <p>What we need most is not more party unity in America but more national unity! </p> <p>Especially at a time of war, we need a president we can count on to fight for what's right for our country - not only when it is easy, but when it is hard. </p> <p>When others were silent, John McCain had the judgment to sound the alarm about the mistakes we were making in Iraq. When others wanted to retreat in defeat from the field of battle, when Barack Obama was voting to cut off funding for our troops on the ground.</p> <p>John McCain had the courage to stand against the tide of public opinion and support the surge, and because of that, today, our troops are at last beginning to come home, not in failure, but in honor! </p> <p>Before I conclude, I ask the indulgence of those in this hall tonight, as I want to speak directly to my fellow Democrats and Independents who are watching. </p> <p>I know many of you are angry and frustrated by our government and our politics and for good reason. </p> <p>You may be thinking of voting for John McCain but you're not sure. Some of you have never voted for a Republican before and in an ordinary election, you probably wouldn't. </p> <p>But this is no ordinary election, because these are not ordinary times, and John McCain is no ordinary candidate. You may not agree with John McCain on every issue. </p> <p>But you can always count on him to be straight with you about where he stands, and to stand for what he thinks is right regardless of politics. </p> <p>As president, you can count on John McCain to be a restless reformer, who will clean up Washington and get our government working again for you! </p> <p>So tonight, I ask you whether you are an Independent, a Reagan Democrat or a Clinton Democrat, or just a Democrat: This year, when you vote for president, vote for the person you believe is best for the country, not for the party you happen to belong to. </p> <p>Vote for the leader who, since the age of 17, when he raised his hand and took an oath to defend and protect our Constitution, has always put our country first. </p> <p>So, let's come together to make a great American patriot our next great president!</p>"
