  "<p>The economist Milton Friedman continues to divide opinion from the grave. Admirers believe that his free-market gospel helped to spur the greatest surge of global entrepreneurial activity and wealth production in the last hundred years. His critics say he provided an ideological alibi for the biggest upward redistribution of wealth in living memory, with a devil-take-the-hindmost attitude towards the non-rich. </p> <p>So when the University of Chicago, whose economics department has been an incubator for the free-market creed, announced in May that a new institute would be named in his honour, it set off a fierce intellectual skirmish. </p> <p>Seven committee members were appointed last year to formulate a plan for a research centre on \"economy and society\": five were economists, the sixth came from the law school and the seventh was based at the business school (which opened a thriving London branch in 2005). </p> <p>\"The economics department is small, compared to some of its rivals,\" Lars Hansen, the interim director of the new institute, told the Guardian. This is a chance, he believes, \"to reach out and broaden\" its approach, resources, and influence.</p> <p>The university is coughing up half a million dollars for start-up costs this autumn and is seeking $200m more. Anyone donating a million or more is offered \"privileged access\" to the institute. </p> <p>But 101 tenured professors - 8% of the teaching staff - have petitioned the university's president, Robert Zimmer, to convene a meeting of all staff in the coming academic year to discuss the purposes of the institute. To which Zimmer has agreed. </p> <p><strong>Rich man's club</strong></p> <p>A distinguished anthropologist, Marshall Sahlins, is among those who fear that the institute will operate as \"a rich man's club\", and operate on the principle that \"the people who have the most money have the most truth\".</p> <p>A fellow petitioner, Bruce Lincoln, professor in the department of religion, anticipates that the institute will generate \"a symbiosis of a certain kind of donor with a certain kind of institute\" in what he calls a \"feedback loop\" to help the wealthy to become wealthier at the expense of everyone else.</p> <p>\"This is a big departure from the mission of the university,\" Lincoln complains.</p> <p>Hansen responds: \"To set up an institute with no criticism from outside would be silly to us. That's not our ambition.\"</p> <p>Friedman, who died in 2006, was one of very few economists to become a household name, partly due to writing in popular publications (such as Newsweek), partly because of several television series championing his market-knows-best ideology, and partly as a result of his enormous appeal to conservatives. </p> <p>In postwar America, Friedman's market fundamentalism was regarded as lunatic-fringe stuff until Vietnam overspending, the collapse of the gold standard in 1971, stagflation and the oil crises. The problems seemed at least as much political in nature as economic.</p> <p>In the 1980s, President Ronald Reagan invoked Friedman's anti-governmental philosophy as the answer to American economic woes - although Reagan heretically indulged in protectionism, corporate tax breaks and subsidies at the same time as he cut taxes and regulations. </p> <p>The free-market case spread to Britain, too, where the prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, was an ardent supporter. She shared the dislike of Friedman and his followers for regulation, trade unions, the welfare state and public works.</p> <p><strong>Chicago boys</strong></p> <p>The institute debate reopens old sores on campus stretching back to a 1970s uproar about the \"Chicago boys\".</p> <p>They were hardcore proponents of the free market, trained at the university principally by Arnold Harberger and by Friedman himself. (The latter also worked for General Pinochet in Chile, imposing free markets, critics say, at the point of a bayonet.) </p> <p>Sahlins says that the purpose of the Milton Friedman institute seems to be to \"make the university safe for free markets the same way that the Chicago boys made the world safe for free enterprise\". Institutes named after controversial people do not always emulate their views, but the founding committee's mission statement sounds unequivocal: \"Following Friedman's lead, the design and evaluation of economic policy requires analyses that respect the incentives of individuals and the essential role of markets in allocating goods and services. As Friedman and others continually demonstrated, design of public policy without regard to market alternatives has adverse social consequences.\"</p> <p>The petitioners find this statement hard to square with reassurances of scholarly openness. </p> <p>Committee member John Cochrane of the business school deems the lecturers' petition \"drivel\" and wonders \"just what is it that you good-thinking guys and gals have against human freedom?\" The centre, Cochrane insists, is conceived of \"pretty explicitly as an economic research institute without a particular ideology\".</p> <p>Economist bloggers describe the petitioners as \"pinks\", \"pathetic\" and \"driven by purest envy\". </p> <p>\"That shows the contempt with which these people treat those who don't share their orthodoxy,\" Lincoln replies. \"They feel entitled and dismissive.\"</p> <p><strong>Fraught atmosphere</strong></p> <p>Critics believe independent scholars would be unlikely to want to step into this fraught atmosphere. Most economists would give the new institute a wide berth, they fear.</p> <p>A \"really robust institute\" would be one that explored all kinds of visions, Lincoln argues, and has a \"place for Friedmanite theory within a larger spectrum\". </p> <p>He adds: \"The centre contradicts the spirit of inquiry, openness and give-and-take that a university ought to be devoted to.\"</p> <p>But the founding committee members say they are puzzled by all the fuss, and suggest that the petitioners are pushing against an open door.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The committee report, lecturers' petition and other corespondance regarding the Milton Friedman Institute can be found <a href=\"http://www.stat.uchicago.edu/~amit/MFI/index.html\">here</a></p> <h2>Politics of research</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Building of the George W Bush library, museum and research centre is due to begin at the Southern Methodist University in Dallas next year. A 12,500-signature petition says the institute is \"utterly unacceptable\".</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>The Hoover Institution, a neocon thinktank on the Stanford campus, in California, is not formally part of the university and has its own staff. Gary Becker, one of the founding committee members of the Milton Friedman Institute, is a member.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>The John M Olin Foundation pumped more than $300m into conservative scholarship before shutting down in 2005. This included John M Olin institutes at Harvard and Chicago.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>From 1970 to 2000, there was an increase from fewer than 70 to more than 300 thinktanks, with two-thirds of the new ones being conservative in orientation, according to Andrew Rich, author of Think Tanks, Public Policy and the Politics of Expertise.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>In 1996, donors gave $47.8m to liberal institutes, $169m to conservative ones and $319m to places of no identifiable leanings.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Most partisan research centres are unconnected to universities. The Hoover Institution, Heritage Foundation and American Enterprise Institute, line up against the Institute for Policy Studies, the Progressive Policy Institute and People for the American Way, on the liberal left.</p>",
  "<p>The material being used in the global propaganda effort \"to taint the al-Qaida brand\" is designed, in the jargon of Whitehall counterterrorism experts, to \"undermine their narrative,\" according to the classified Whitehall paper seen by the Guardian.</p> <p>The research, information and communications unit (RICU) document says the effort is being made to \"help the AQ-in-decline debate resonate\" and says the campaign is justified as al-Qaida is the most influential and coherent terrorist ideology or \"brand\", and the threat posed to the UK or its interests overseas remains real and sustained.</p> <p>\"AQ is not the only extremist ideology of interest or concern, domestically or overseas. But countering the AQ threat is a counterterrorism priority and requires AQ-centric communications efforts,\" it adds.</p> <p>The target of the campaign - the al-Qaida narrative - is seen as linking together genuine or perceived, commonly held concerns into a \"narrative of grievance\" that reinforces the portrayal of Muslims as victims of western injustice.</p> <p>\"It [the narrative] combines fact, fiction, emotion and religion and manipulates discontent about local and international issues. The narrative is simple, flexible and infinitely accommodating. It can be adapted to suit local conditions and may have a disproportionate influence on understanding and interpretation of local or global events.\"</p> <p>RICU says it needs to be challenged to reduce the opportunity for terrorist exploitation of underlying grievances: \"The objective is not to dismiss 'grievances' but undermine AQ's position as their champion: and violent extremism as the solution.\"</p> <p>Its dossier, aimed mainly at embassies around the world, is described as \"our first tailored product with key arguments exposing the theme 'AQ is losing support'\". It promises that more such packages are to follow.</p> <p>It says: \"This series of guidance alone will not fatally undermine the AQ narrative. But it can increase our impact against the narrative while we develop a bespoke and hard-hitting campaign using private sector resources.\"</p> <p>The document does not spell out what it means by \"private sector resources\" but it does add in a section on its \"future workstreams\" that \"we are in negotiations with several major communications companies to design and deliver high impact campaigns across media and non-media channels\". This may mean private sector public relations companies being involved in the work.</p> <p>RICU expects the Foreign Office to be the \"biggest initial user\" of this material through its embassies and consular posts but it is also working with other Whitehall departments to use it in wider discussions around terrorism, extremism or ideology. </p> <p>Civil servants are urged to \"push these message themes to a wide range of contacts\".</p> <p>RICU, which is based in the Home Office, has previously advised Whitehall officials dealing with Muslim communities not to use the aggressive rhetoric of the \"war on terror\" but instead to refer to violent extremism and to drop the language of the \"clash of civilisations\" when talking about the nature of the terrorist threat.</p> <p>In a counterterrorism phrasebook, RICU warned those engaged in such work that talk of a struggle for values or a battle of ideas is often heard as a \"confrontation/clash between civilisations/cultures\". Instead, it suggested that talking about the idea of shared values works much more effectively.</p> <p>Sir Richard Mottram, the former chair of the joint intelligence committee, in talking about the attempt to undermine the ideology of al-Qaida, said it had to be done without looking like government propaganda. \"If it looks too much like government propaganda then I don't think people are going to listen, nor should they,\" he said last year.</p> <h2>Backstory</h2> <p>The research, information and communications unit (RICU) is a <strong>counterterrorism</strong> PR operation set up in 2007 within the newly created<strong> office</strong> <strong>of security and counterterrorism</strong>. Though based in the Home Office, RICU also reports to the Foreign Office and Department for Communities and Local Government. Its creation, <strong>Tony Blair </strong>said in March 2007, \"marked a change in the government's approach to <strong>managing the terrorist threat</strong> to the UK and winning the battle for <strong>hearts and minds</strong>\". The home secretary, <strong>Jacqui Smith</strong>, shares <strong>responsibility</strong> for RICU, alongside the minister for security, counterterrorism and police, <strong>Admiral Sir Alan West</strong>.</p>",
  "<h2>Is employment the goal?</h2> <p>The issues facing young people with learning difficulties when they leave school (The chance to live a full life, August 19) apply equally to those with complex physical disabilities. Janet Murray's article raises a number of key questions.</p> <p>The first is whether paid employment is an achievable goal for all those with disabilities or learning difficulties. A proper job can bring improved self-esteem, financial independence and a ready-made social network. But if support is not provided, failure is almost built in. Equally, if paid employment is seen as the only goal, it will be setting young people up to fail. Many social enterprises and voluntary groups have demonstrated where a young person can add social, rather than just economic, value.</p> <p>The second issue surrounds independent living. Policy presupposes that young people want support to either live at home or have a place of their own. But there are positive benefits to sharing life in a residential group, including the chance to develop skills and relationships. This is something that we at Treloar College have been successfully developing for a number of years.<br><strong>Graham Jowett</strong><br>Director of education, Treloar Trust, Alton, Hampshire</p> <p>A recent study into supported employment services shows that while people with learning disabilities can become excellent employees, an individual's success is greatly affected by the presence or otherwise of softer skills such as punctuality. Although a forward-thinking employer will make reasonable adjustments to help someone develop these skills, schools and colleges must also play a greater role. Young people with learning disabilities should be offered the same opportunities as their non-disabled peers so they can gain a better understanding of how people act in a work environment.</p> <p>Our study also shows that a lack of flexibility within the benefits system can make it difficult for people to progress once they have found work. Under existing rules, some people can only work 3.5 hours a week before their benefits are affected. Both the perceived and potential loss of benefits can act as a disincentive to someone with a learning disability who may need to increase their hours gradually in order to build up confidence.</p> <p>The potential benefits of successful employment are huge not only for the young people but also their employers, colleagues and wider society. We must make it a realistic option for everyone who wants to work.<br><strong>Diane Lightfoot</strong><br>Director of communications, United Response, London</p> <h2>The unfairness of it all</h2> <p>Gerry Abbott is right to question the minister for lifelong learning's understanding of his job title. </p> <p>Bill Rammell's view, as exemplified in his notorious \"Equal and Lower Qualification\" policy, is that, whatever their motivations for studying, lifelong learners divert resources from first-time entrants. He has repeatedly said that this is, in principle, unfair.</p> <p>He is therefore, by his own lights, the minister for unfair learning. <br><strong>Ian Ground</strong>, Heaton, Newcastle upon Tyne</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Email <a href=\"mailto:education.letters@theguardian.com\">education.letters@theguardian.com</a>.

  "<p>Russia was last night on another collision course with the west after Russian MPs voted unanimously to back independence for Georgia's two breakaway republics of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The move - which requires the approval of Russia's president, Dmitry Medvedev - gives a strong domestic legal basis for the Kremlin to take control of the areas after Russia's invasion of Georgia this month.</p> <p>Russia's upper house, or Federation Council, voted by 130-0 to call on Medvedev to support South Ossetia and Abkhazia's independence. The Duma passed the same motion by 447-0. Both houses are known for their slavish loyalty to the Kremlin.</p> <p>The US and the EU swiftly denounced the vote. George Bush said he was \"deeply concerned\" by the move, and the White House said the vice-president, Dick Cheney, would visit Tbilisi next week. The EU said the breakaway regions should remain in Georgia. The German government called the move \"in no way appropriate to either calming or defusing tensions\".</p> <p>But there were strong signs last night that Moscow remains unmoved by the threat of western sanctions, which have been growing since Russia invaded Georgia after Georgia's military incursion into South Ossetia this month.</p> <p>The US, France, Britain and other EU countries are considering punitive measures. These include ending Nato cooperation with Moscow, freezing Russia's application to join the World Trade Organisation, and suspending its participation in G8 summits.</p> <p>Speaking in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, however, Medvedev yesterday suggested he would be unconcerned if Nato chose to sever ties. This would be \"no great loss\", he said. \"If they choose to break off this relationship, even the whole of it, nothing terrible will happen.\" </p> <p>Medvedev's comments signal a further deterioration in Russia's fraught relations with the west. The French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, has convened a special EU meeting on Georgia on Monday to consider future relations with Moscow. </p> <p>The meeting comes amid growing dismay at Russia's failure to comply with the ceasefire agreement and pull out all of its troops. </p> <p>Russia has previously stopped short of recognising the regions' independence. But Moscow is likely to use the votes to pressure the international community into accepting Abkhazia and South Ossetia as no different from Kosovo - whose US-backed declaration of independence in February was vehemently opposed by Russia and Serbia.</p> <p>The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, recently indicated a change by saying that Georgia could \"forget about\" its territorial integrity. But promoting separatism in the Caucasus holds dangers for Russia, which faces growing insurgencies in its southern republics and has fought two brutal wars combating separatism in Chechnya.</p> <p>One analyst said it was unlikely that the Kremlin would unilaterally recognise South Ossetian and Abkhazian independence. \"This would be more troublesome and problematic for Russia,\" said Fyodor Lukyanov, the editor-in-chief of the journal Russia in Global Affairs.</p> <p>Russia's preferred \"scenario\" would be for the two to eventually win Kosovo-style acceptance, he said, rather than suffer the unresolved fate of Turkish-backed northern Cyprus. </p> <p>\"My guess is that this vote is a means to achieve better conditions for international negotiations,\" he added. </p> <p>Georgia's national security council secretary, Alexander Lomaia, said the Kremlin would isolate itself if it recognised the regions, which have enjoyed de facto independence since the early 1990s.</p> <p>\"If it does this, Russia will further isolate itself from the entire world, and will force the international community to seek more active ways to restore the territorial integrity of Georgia,\" he told Reuters.</p> <p>Georgia yesterday said Russian troops continued to occupy much of the country. In the Black Sea port of Poti, south of Abkhazia, Russian soldiers drove into the port terminal and took away computers and photocopiers in armoured personnel carriers, Georgian officials said.</p> <p>The deputy chief of Russia's army staff, Colonel-General Anatoly Nogovitsyn, said his troops were merely performing peacekeeping duties, adding that the EU-brokered ceasefire deal allowed them to be there, despite the fact that it calls for Russian forces to return to the positions they occupied before the war started.</p> <p>He said Russian troops were needed in Poti, not least because of the arrival in the area of Nato ships: \"The fact that there are nine western warships in the Black Sea cannot but be a cause for concern.\"</p> <h2>Market verdict</h2> <p>Russia is facing another chastening reprimand, this time from the financial markets. The main stock index has fallen 20% in the last month, dipping yesterday to its lowest level since November 2006. The rouble is also under pressure. Georgia is not the only factor, but it has clearly rattled the markets. However, Russia is a long way from a repeat of its financial meltdown, the 10th anniversary of which recently passed almost unnoticed.</p>",
  "<p>India's second largest IT services business, Infosys Technologies, yesterday swooped on UK-based Axon Group with an all-cash offer of \u00a3407m as it attempts to strengthen its position in European markets. The deal will see the three men who founded Axon in 1994 walk away with nearly \u00a370m.</p> <p>Infosys employs more than 90,000 people, with the majority in India. IT consultancy Axon has 2,000 employees and works with firms that use business software from German developer SAP.</p> <p>Infosys chief executive Kris Gopalakrishnan, one of the original team of seven who founded the company in 1981 with only $250 (\u00a3140), moved to assuage fears that the deal would lead to job losses and mass-outsourcing of Axon's work to the subcontinent. He said there is little overlap between the clients of the two companies.</p> <p>\"It is very important to us that people stay and make the whole thing work,\" he stressed. \"We are doing this acquisition so we can leverage all the employees.\"</p> <p>The deal, which values Axon at 600p and is being funded from Infosys's cash pile, has the backing of Axon's management and its founders who hold just under 17.9% of the business.</p> <p>The deal will crystallise the fortune of Mark Hunter, the Belfast-born IT expert who stepped down as chairman at the end of last year. He was part of the three-man team who founded Axon back in 1994, and brought it to the stock market five years later. He has been selling down his stake over the past few years and now holds just under 11.5% which is worth \u00a344m.</p> <p>Co-founder Donald Kirkwood will receive more than \u00a314.4m for his remaining shares while the last of the original team, Paul Manweiler, will get about \u00a310.4m.</p> <p>Axon has expanded into the US over recent years, buying rival Feanix in 2005 and clinching three further deals the following year. It also has operations in Asia including a base in China.</p> <p>In April at the company's annual meeting chief executive Steve Cardell, who Infosys hopes will remain with the business, said \"despite the uncertain macroeconomic environment, trading has been encouraging\".</p> <p>Axon is due to report its half-year results this morning with analysts expecting revenues of about \u00a3120m and operating profits of about \u00a320m.</p>",
  "<p>Kenneth Till, who has died aged 88, was the first full-time paediatric neurosurgeon in Great Britain. His reputation was founded on his years of dedicated service to children, many with profoundly distressing problems - he was outstanding in his capacity to communicate with children and their parents.</p> <p>His name will be linked enduringly with the development of the Dahl-Wade-Till valve (DWT) for shunting hydrocephalus (accumulations of cerebrospinal fluid in the ventricles of the brain). It resulted from an improbable association between Kenneth, the writer Roald Dahl, and the hydraulic engineer Stanley Wade. The impetus for the collaboration were the complications of serious head injury sustained in an accident by Dahl's then infant son Theo in the early 1960s. Thus did the three men work successfully together on the DWT valve.</p> <p>Kenneth was born in Stoke-on-Trent, where his father was an impecunious ceramic designer who was studying at the Royal College of Art in London, and his mother worked in a corset factory. The family moved to Dorset, first living in a bell tent by the beach and then in a caravan. Although he did not start school until he was seven, he obtained a scholarship to Downing College, Cambridge from Poole grammar school. He talked of Cambridge being a highlight of his life, with stories of surmounting novel challenges such as what to wear and how to eat unfamiliar food.</p> <p>He completed his medical training at St George's hospital, London, qualifying in 1944, with his fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons following in 1953. After national service as an RAF medical officer, postgraduate training continued at Atkinson Morley's hospital, Wimbledon, part of St George's hospital, where Wylie McKissock was his mentor. McKissock appointed Kenneth first assistant at the Hospital for Sick Children, Great Ormond Street (GOS) in 1953. A sabbatical year in 1956 at the Children's Memorial Hospital in Chicago consolidated his experience in paediatric neurosurgery.</p> <p>Kenneth was appointed consultant to GOS in 1959, where he developed the first centre of its kind in Britain and received patients from throughout the country and beyond. He was also on the staff of University College Hospital. Although Wylie was senior consultant neurosurgeon at GOS until his retirement, virtually the entire neurosurgical workload devolved on Kenneth. Two elective surgical lists each week plus emergencies would always be a heavy commitment but, given the fraught nature of the problems he was dealing with, he bore an unenviable responsibility, unrelieved until the appointment of a second neurosurgeon in 1970. He was permanently on call; an evening at the theatre always meant giving the box office his seat number. And he continued to train junior neurosurgeons until his retirement.</p> <p>Kenneth was in practice long enough to share the excitement that came with a long-desired, but seemingly unrealisable advance in diagnostic brain scanning - first CT, then magnetic resonance imaging. With these advances, elements of guesswork in the diagnostic process became considerably less and tumour localisation more precise. He was instrumental in obtaining funds for the purchase and installation of one of the first scanners at GOS which was opened by the Queen in 1977 - and of course, had an unqualified right of access to the new facility for his patients, a privilege his colleagues envied but did not begrudge.</p> <p>He was also much involved in the development of craniofacial surgery at GOS, where combined expertise in neurosurgery, plastic surgery, craniofacial surgery, and orthodontics required expert teamwork to correct congenital deformities of the face and skull. He collaborated with Paul Tessier, the world-renowned Paris craniofacial surgeon.</p> <p>Kenneth was a founder in 1972 of the International Society of Paediatric Neurosurgery. He chaired the second annual meeting of the society when it met in London in 1974, and was its president in 1979. Kenneth made lasting friendships across language and cultural boundaries, and the society remains a valuable global resource for neurosurgeons. In 1975 his Paediatric Neurosurgery was published. After retirement from GOS in 1980, he served for several years on the editorial staffs of several journals including the Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry.</p> <p>Kenneth's calm, kind and compassionate manner reflected his essential goodness - a view echoed when my colleagues heard the news of his passing. </p> <p>He enjoyed a very happy marriage. Morwenna, his widow, is also a medical graduate formerly engaged in leukaemia research at the Institute of Child Health. She had particular insight into the near-insupportable demands on his time and energies, and her understanding cushioned the competing demands of clinical duties and of family life.</p> <p>He is survived by Morwenna, four children and grandchildren</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Kenneth Till, paediatric surgeon, born February 12 1920; died July 8 2008</p>",
  "<p>Pressure for an overhaul of the Edinburgh Fringe festival intensified yesterday after it emerged that ticket sales for this year's events fell by 10% - the first fall in eight years.</p> <p>The Fringe director, Jon Morgan, admitted that a series of crises with ticketing after a new computerised box office system collapsed on the first day of online ticket sales in June had contributed to the poor sales this year, one of the most difficult in the event's recent history. </p> <p>Overall sales hit 1,535,500 - confirming the Fringe's status as the world's largest arts festival, but that was down markedly from the 1.7m tickets sold last year and it ends eight years of growth in sales.</p> <p>Many venue directors have been angered by repeated technical problems with the Fringe's new central box office, which affected advance tickets for roughly 40,000 people.</p> <p>The Fringe board responded by setting up two independent reviews into the overall running and management of the festival, and the \u00a3300,000 box office system. The Glasgow-based firm that designed the Liquid Box Office software programme involved, Pivotal Integration, went into administration last week. </p> <p>Morgan said this year's performance was \"fantastic\" since the Fringe had faced a series of challenges, including the economy, the clash with the Olympics, the loss of some venues and poor weather. \"For the third year in a row we have sold in excess of 1.5m tickets,\" he said. \"That is a terrific achievement against a backdrop of the global economic situation, an incredibly wet August, competition from a fantastic Olympic games and of course the problems with the box office system.\"</p> <p>Fringe officials said the Edinburgh Tattoo had also suffered from the credit crunch, particularly with large numbers of returned tickets from the United States. Tattoo officials confirmed travel companies had returned about 5% of tickets, but all had then been sold, leading to another sell-out event. Other festivals in Edinburgh this month are also expected to report record audiences - in contrast to the Fringe. The international book festival, which closed yesterday, expects to report today that its ticket sales increased by 4% this year. The official festival, which ends this Sunday, has reported the biggest-selling dance show in its 61-year history and record internet bookings. </p> <p>Bill Burdett-Coutts, who runs the Assembly Rooms, one of the city's largest and most influential venues, said the box office fiasco had been the biggest single issue affecting Fringe sales this year. He rejected Morgan's suggestion that the Olympics was a competitor. </p> <p>\"I think the box office effect has been the major issue at this year's festival. I think it has caused a great deal of upset with the public and it has impacted on a proportion of the audience, who will have been put off,\" he said.</p> <p>The box office problems were \"absolutely at the top\" of the list of problems experienced by the Fringe. \" I think we've lost the confidence of the public through ticketing and I think it will take a long time to build it up again.\" </p> <p>Burdett-Coutts also challenged the accuracy of the Fringe's sales figures, since venues were still putting on performances last night. He said it would take several weeks to verify total sales from all the city's venues.</p> <p>Laura Mackenzie-Stuart, from the Universal Arts venue and another leading critic of the Fringe board, said Morgan was right to claim that the box office crisis had less impact on overall sales than the credit crunch, the weather and the Olympics. After the Fringe started, ticket sales had gone smoothly, she said.</p> <p>However, the Fringe board still had questions to answer about its handling of the new box office system.</p>",
  "<p>Brazil is bracing for an imminent ruling on the future of one of its largest indigenous reservations - a decision that campaigners claim could spell disaster for indigenous communities across the country.</p> <p>The supreme court is expected to announce its verdict tomorrow in a case brought by a group of farmers, businessmen and politicians who claim the 2005 creation of the Raposa Serra do Sol reservation was \"unconstitutional\" and are demanding the right to remain.</p> <p>Located in the isolated Amazonian state of Roraima, the sprawling 1.7m-hectare (4.2m-acre) reserve was ordered by Brazil's president, Luiz In\u00e1cio da Silva, and is home to more than 18,000 aborigines from five different ethnic groups. Campaigners hailed the establishment of Raposa Serra do Sol as a historic move to protect the country's indigenous peoples from contact with the outside world.</p> <p>Nearly all non-aborigines require legal permission to enter indigenous lands. But several rice farmers have continued to operate inside the reserve. They describe the demarcation of Raposa Serra do Sol as an obstacle to economic development and point to the fact that there are numerous aborigines among their employees.</p> <p>Violence erupted earlier this year after government attempts to remove all non-indigenous people from the reserve. Bridges were burned and one group of aborigines was shot at, allegedly by gunmen hired by local farmers.</p> <p>Paulo Cesar Quartiero, a rice farmer who was arrested earlier this year for resisting eviction, has blamed a foreign conspiracy for the creation of the reserve. \"History will show who is selling Brazil and who is defending the nation,\" he said last week.</p> <p>Many senior members of the military see the reserve - located along the borders with Venezuela and Guyana - as a threat to national security. Last year, the Brazilian military told the Guardian it believed drug traffickers may be taking advantage of the state's absence and using aborigines to smuggle cocaine into Brazil.</p> <p>But campaigners say a supreme court ruling that reduced the size of the reserve or allowed non-aborigines to remain would encourage further invasions by miners, loggers and ranchers that could devastate the region's indigenous communities.</p> <p>Fiona Watson, a campaigner from Survival International, a NGO, said a decision tomorrow in favour of the farmers could destroy the indigenous \"way of life and set a catastrophic precedent for Indians all over the country\".</p> <p>During a visit to one village in the isolated reserve last year Pierlangela Nascimento da Cunha, a prominent indigenous campaigner, said the conflict over Raposa Serra do Sol was part of a wider offensive against indigenous rights. That offensive included a government bill that proposed opening up such reserves to mining companies in search of gold and diamonds.</p> <p>\"Brazil wants to be a big power. But this does not give it the right to steamroll over the rights of the Indians,\" said Cunha, who travelled to London in June to discuss the situation in Raposa Serra do Sol with British MPs and members of the Foreign Office.</p> <p>\"The development of our country cannot be achieved through the extinction of its indigenous people and by disrespecting their rights. The big economic interests see [aborigines] as an obstacle.\"</p>",
  "<p>Polls in the US show that most Americans are concerned at the negativity of Europeans towards their country. Polls of Europeans suggest a straightforward solution: elect Barack Obama as US president. The most powerful leader in the world will then be more multilateralist, less aggressive and more acceptable to the European ear. But is it that simple?</p> <p>The most popular recent American president - according to surveys of Britons, Germans and Italians - is Bill Clinton. In that finding is the warning for America. During the Clinton years very little was done to combat the spread of militant Islam. Al-Qaida's planning for the 9/11 attacks didn't start when the supreme court conspired to install the nasty George Bush in the White House. It began when the ever so reasonable Clinton was still in office.</p> <p>Europeans may want someone like themselves in the White House, but difficult times call for a president willing to eschew short-term popularity and pursue long-term respect. Europeans hope for a president who will abandon Bush's foreign policy, but he has pursued many different foreign policies. What Europeans want to end is the \"neoconservatism\" seen in Iraq. But all the favoured policies of Berlin and Paris have been used by the US over the past eight years.</p> <p>\"Realpolitik\" has been tried in Pakistan, where billions of dollars have been used to prop up a west-leaning dictator. The \"multilateralism\" favoured by the EU and the UN has dominated efforts to stop Iran acquiring nuclear weapons. Crude appeasement has characterised relations with Saudi Arabia.</p> <p>Given the reduction in violence brought about by the troop surge in Iraq, it is no longer ridiculous to believe the aggressive interventionism seen in that country will turn out to be the most successful policy of the Bush era. In 10 years, Iraq may be one of the Middle East's most stable nations. In worst-case scenarios, Iran may have nuclear weapons, Pakistan may be in the hands of extremists and Saudi Arabia may be in the grip of Wahhabi fundamentalists.</p> <p>The highest moment for recent US foreign policy was after the initial invasion of Iraq. With its allies, it had used hard power, not soft. It hadn't waited on UN approval, but it had kept its promise to topple Saddam Hussein. Polls in Britain showed majority support for the war. That American strength and success caused Syria to withdraw its forces from Lebanon. Libya gave up its WMD. Pakistan's giveaway of its nuclear secrets was exposed. The grave problems we have seen since have been caused by US weakness and incompetence.</p> <p>Favouring European approaches to global problems may bring some short-term popularity, but it is more important that the world's only serious policeman is strong and seen to be strong. The world will applaud an America that quits Iraq, that submits to the authority of the UN and signs up to the economic restrictions associated with environmentalism. But insofar as those changes of policy enfeeble America, the world will become a much more dangerous place.</p> <p>America should not ignore world opinion, which has been correct to worry about the way the US has compromised on human rights in the war on terror. John McCain and Barack Obama have both pledged to end the torture-like practices that have done terrible harm to America's reputation. The next US president also needs to do much more to explain American policy and to treat US allies more generously.</p> <p>But world opinion should not stop America from taking tough decisions. An America that seeks to be loved may end up being neither loved nor respected. An America that is strong in the defence of the values of Kennedy and Reagan may be surprised at the grudging respect it will eventually earn.</p> <p>Tim Montgomerie is editor of a new website, <a href=\"http://www.americaintheworld.com\">AmericaInTheWorld.com</a></p>",
  "<p>High levels of air pollution in London have forced the government to seek an urgent meeting with the mayor, Boris Johnson, to avoid the risk of unlimited fines from Europe.</p> <p>The air quality minister, Jonathan Shaw, has written to the mayor offering the expertise of officials at the Department for Environment. The letter, written last month and obtained under freedom of information laws, says that Britain plans to ask for an extension until June 2011 to meet its legal requirements.</p> <p>Britain has been breaking EU air quality laws on particulate pollution for three years and in July the EU demanded a detailed plan of how it will comply. </p> <p>In addition, the new EU air quality directive will force the UK to reduce nitrogen dioxide pollution on some of the capital's busiest streets by more than a third by the end of 2009, in order to move towards World Health Organisation guidelines. If air quality improvements are not achieved quickly, the UK could be taken to the European court. The court has powers to impose unlimited fines. </p> <p>\"The objective was due to be met in 2005 but in recognition that nearly all member states are finding this very challenging ... [the government] intends to apply for this compliance flexibility,\" Shaw wrote. \"My officials wish to work with your officials. We should not underestimate the scale of the task and we will also need to develop further national as well as local measures.\"</p> <p>Air pollution in big cities is worsening as motorists switch from petrol to diesel to save fuel. Particulate pollution from diesel engines is linked to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases and asthma. Air pollution causes an estimated 32,000 premature deaths a year in Britain and between 157,000 and 319,000 people in London are exposed to nitrogen dioxide levels above EU limits, the government says.</p> <p>\"The government has been aware of the problem since 1999 but has taken no action,\" said Simon Birkett, who chairs the Campaign for Clean Air in London. \"These obligations can only be met if long overdue action is taken now.\"</p> <p>However, the government is in difficult political territory because taking such action will depend on Conservative party cooperation and the backing of Johnson, who in the three months since he was elected has threatened to ditch several measures that have improved air quality, including the western extension of the congestion charge and twice yearly taxi checks. </p> <p>In addition, he is backing the expansion of London City airport and considering a road bridge over the Thames in east London, both of which would worsen pollution in the capital. </p> <p>It is expected that London will have to introduce additional low emission zones with tighter standards than the existing zone, which covers only large vehicles, and could also demand that vehicles fit pollution abatement equipment.</p> <p>It will also be challenging for the government to meet the EU target for nitrogen dioxide. Average annual concentrations in parts of central London are more than double the standard set in 1999, which became law earlier this year and requires compliance within 16 months. </p> <p>The mayor's office said he was fully committed to working with the government. \"He is also working, through Transport for London, to cut emissions from transport through a shift to walking and cycling and the use of new technology. He has committed \u00a31m for the development of less polluting taxis, while by 2012 all new buses on the streets will have lower emission hybrid engines.\"</p>",
  "<p>The economy is facing a period at \"least as challenging\" as the 1970s, when Britain sank into a deep recession, the deputy governor of the Bank of England, Charles Bean, warned yesterday.</p> <p>He also held out little prospect of any rapid improvement, suggesting that the global economic slowdown was likely \"to drag on for some considerable time\".</p> <p>The glum forecast follows publication of government data last week that showed the UK economy had ground to a halt in the second quarter of the year, as households and businesses cut spending. Many economists believe a recession is almost inevitable in the coming half year.</p> <p>Bean, who was speaking from a conference of the world's top central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, admitted that they as a group had failed to realise the severity of the current downturn. He told the BBC: \"Last year this was a financial crisis that we thought with a bit of luck would be over by Christmas, but it has dragged on for a year and looks like it will drag on for some considerable time further yet.</p> <p>\"It is fair to say that if you look at the shocks impinging on us, this is at least as challenging a time as back in the 1970s,\" he added. \"Some people have said it is as big a financial shock as the Great Depression and as far as the oil shock goes, the rise in oil prices is in the same order of magnitude that we had to deal with in the 1970s.\"</p> <p>It is now more than a year since the credit crunch emerged, after homeowners in the United States began defaulting on their mortgages in large numbers. The impact has been felt around the world, with property prices slumping and triggering the near collapse of banks including Northern Rock in Britain and Bear Stearns in the US. Coupled with rising food and energy costs, the global economy is facing potentially toxic conditions.</p> <p>\"There are periods when markets look like they are getting better. Then another grenade explodes, another bout of fear of sustainability of some financial institutions, maybe intervention by the authorities,\" Bean said. \"It has been very much ebb and flow and the mood here is very much one of financial caution as regards next year. We have our fingers crossed, but there is the recognition there is still quite a long way to go yet.\"</p> <p>He said that disposable income was \"very low\" and there would be a \"tricky period\" ahead for households. \"There are difficult social issues that will arise.\"</p> <p>The annual growth rate in Britain has slowed to 1.4%, its weakest since late 1992 when the pound was forced from the Exchange Rate Mechanism on \"Black Wednesday\". A recession is technically defined as two successive quarters of a declining economy. Bean said it was \"foolish to believe\" that another downturn of that magnitude could be prevented, although better regulation might help cushion the blow.</p> <p>Two weeks ago, the Bank of England governor, Mervyn King, warned that a \"difficult and painful\" period would bring the economy to a halt over the coming year. He said there were \"bound\" to be one or two quarters of falling output as Britain felt the full force of rising commodity prices and the year-long credit crunch. </p> <p>King predicted that inflation would rise to more than 5%, but the fear of recession has convinced economists that the Bank will cut interest rates later this year or early in 2009. The Bank's monetary policy committee has kept rates at 5% since April, torn between the desire to tame inflation and the need to kick-start the economy.</p> <p>Bean is still holding out hope that the economy will improve next year and described the downturn as a \"transitory period of subdued growth\".</p> <p>\"On the assumption commodity prices remain stable and if anything fall back, then inflation should drop back as we go through next year,\" he said. \"One would hope that the conditions in credit markets should gradually start to improve and those two factors will help to ensure growth will start to pick up as we go through next year.\"</p> <p>During the second quarter, manufacturing and construction contracted, with only the service sector barely expanding.</p>",
  "<p>When the pre-neoclassical home of George Finlay, the great Scottish historian, came up for sale in Athens' historic Plaka district, Anna Pataki and her painter husband rushed to buy it. </p> <p>Seduced by the once gaudy, neon-lit neighbourhood's transformation into one of Europe's most beautiful residential areas, the couple represented a new breed of Athenian keen to move into the heart of the ancient capital. </p> <p>\"Thanks to protective zoning laws, Plaka had become habitable again and was no longer just for night life,\" said the 40-year-old publisher. \"We thought it would be a wonderful place to bring up our baby son.\"</p> <p>Now, however, the laws that transformed Plaka from a byword for late-night revelry into an architectural showpiece beneath the Acropolis are about to be overturned by a fiercely pro-business government determined to expand commercial development in the area. </p> <p>For inhabitants such as Pataki, who are credited with imbuing one of Europe's oldest quarters with renewed life, the future of Plaka hangs in the balance. If the ruling conservatives have their way, she and other residents fear the district will quickly go back to the bad old days when it was a shambolic area overrun by tavernas, bars, discos and nightclubs. That, say conservationists who have rallied to the cause, would undo efforts that have changed Plaka into a place not only steeped in architectural tradition but unrivalled in elegance and charm.</p> <p>But for entrepreneurs eager to expand businesses in its narrow lanes, amid Roman and Ottoman ruins, the proposed reforms are a dream come true. After nearly 30 years of being subject to strict zoning laws, the amendments would allow them to extend premises to the roof terraces and first floors of listed buildings in the \"neighbourhood of the gods\" and increase clientele. </p> <p>Under proposals drawn up by the public works and environment ministry, bars and restaurants would also be able to branch out and expand into adjacent buildings and plots. The government says the move - which would come only months before the long-awaited opening of the new Acropolis Museum - will safeguard the area by ensuring that abandoned buildings are not taken over by drug addicts and homeless people. </p> <p>Others, including Athenians who like nothing better than to flock to Plaka for Sunday walkabouts, say the changes sound the death knell of one of Greece's few environmental success stories. Before the rescue efforts began with the collapse of military rule in 1974, the tiny district hosted almost 200 places of entertainment and an estimated 18,000 chairs.</p> <p>\"I'm dead against any such move. If anything, laws should be more stringent in Plaka,\" said Stefanos Manos, a former conservative environment minister whose policies kick-started the quarter's rehabilitation. \"For 30 years, successive governments from both the left and right have maintained a common front in protecting Plaka and now we have a [an environment] minister who, unbelievably, appears to be giving in to certain interests.\" </p> <p>The Greek media have almost overwhelmingly opposed the reforms and slammed the government for even suggesting them. The unexpected uproar appears to have caught the otherwise powerful environment minister, George Souflias, off guard. Last week, he pledged to \"personally review\" the changes. But residents are far from convinced. With many seeing the promise as another stalling tactic by a government seemingly bent on putting commerce before culture, they have vowed to take the fight all the way to Greece's highest administrative court.</p> <p>\"Every day we see laws being flouted because of ineffective policing,\" said Giorgos Kandalepas, vice-chair of the Plaka residents' committee. \"We're not against having tavernas or bars in the area. We just want to keep the equilibrium that has allowed people and businesses in Plaka to coexist. Otherwise residents will simply leave.\"</p>",

  "<p>Madonna's latest political statement - a montage of images shown during her tour that lumps global warming, Hitler, Robert Mugabe and John McCain into one category and John Lennon, Gandhi and Barack Obama into another - is a perfect example of the sometimes unhelpful nature of celebrity support.

  "<p>Scientists in Japan claim that their country's controversial whaling programme, which has killed thousands of minke whales since the late 1980s, has established that the animals have lost significant amounts of blubber. Measurements taken from more than 4,500 slaughtered minkes show they are getting thinner at a worrying speed, the researchers say.</p> <p>The team from the Institute of Cetacean Research in Tokyo, set up to analyse the results of the scientific whaling programme, says its study offers the first evidence that global warming could be harming whales, because it restricts food supplies. They say the discovery could only have been made by killing the animals. </p> <p>Crucially for the Japanese, the results have been published in a mainstream western scientific journal, Polar Biology. Campaigners say publication could offer scientific whaling a veneer of respectability, and bolster Japan's efforts to hunt more whales. </p> <p>They fear Japan could use the results to support efforts to hunt endangered humpback whales for the first time in 50 years. The study claims the recovering humpback population in the Southern Ocean could also be hurting the minkes because of \"interference\" between the two species as they compete for food.</p> <p>Campaigners and politicians say Japan's scientific whaling programme is commercial whaling by another name and is unethical and unnecessary.</p> <p>Lars Walloe, a Norwegian whale expert at the University of Oslo, who helped the Japanese team analyse the data, and an author of the study, said: \"This is a big change in blubber and if it continues it could make it more difficult for the whales to survive. It indicates there have been some big changes in their ecosystem.\"</p> <p>Whales rely on blubber for energy and insulation. The shift could already be making it more difficult to reproduce, Walloe said. \"I don't think you could measure this by other [non lethal] means.\" </p> <p>He said the Japanese findings, and their publication, had been unpopular among scientists from nations opposed to whaling, including Britain. Two journals refused to print the findings before they were accepted by Polar Biology, which published them online last month. Walloe, who says he does not support the ban on commercial whaling, claimed that the journals that turned down the study did so for political, not scientific, reasons. </p> <p>The findings are the most high profile of the Japanese scientific whaling programme so far.</p> <p>Mark Simmonds, director of science at the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society, said: \"Lots of dead bodies will provide robust data, so if you kill lots of whales then you will get some information. The question is whether the benefits outweigh the number of whales killed and how they were killed. Scientific whaling is not about science, and there is no pressing conservation need that requires it.\"</p>",
  "<p>Dimitar Berbatov does not show much forbearance when a team-mate carelessly misdirects a pass intended for him or, worse still, fails to spot that he is in space. On those occasions the Bulgarian can seem to drop out of the game for a while in disgruntlement. It is as if he wants to send the rest of the Tottenham side to a sin-bin for 10 minutes or so.</p> <p>The likelihood is that this outstanding attacker will banish the entire club from his sight this week by moving to Manchester United. There was a trial separation at the weekend. Although the manager, Juande Ramos, said it was his decision not to include the 27-year-old for the match with Sunderland there is every indication that Berbatov's attitude meant it would, in practice, have been impossible to pick him.</p> <p>Tottenham have been determined to take a tough stance and it is their duty to drive a hard bargain. The chairman, Daniel Levy, showed he had no inclination to acquiesce. While alleging previously that there had been an illegal approach, he accused United of arrogance and hypocrisy. That is bracing talk but there have to be doubts whether it has served his club's interests.</p> <p>Ramos's team are off to a false start. Defeats in both Premier League games have underlined a need for cover in defence. Furthermore, the sale of Robbie Keane to Liverpool, for an irresistible fee of \u00a320.3m, left Tottenham with nothing but a queasy hope that Darren Bent would maintain the form shown in pre-season friendlies. After the defeat to Sunderland, Ramos said: \"We were only able to play with one forward.\"</p> <p>The trouble now is that Tottenham could be restaging the bathos of last season when, despite a great deal of anticipation, the side, initially managed by Martin Jol, took one win from their opening 12 fixtures in the league. No one expects the woe to be prolonged to that degree but the likelihood is that a trip to Stamford Bridge on Sunday will add to the current disquiet.</p> <p>If Berbatov does sign for United shortly, will Tottenham really feel as if the extra few million pounds have vindicated the whole exercise? There are no grounds for warming to them as feisty underdogs. When occupying a comparatively similar position to that of United they, too, flex their muscle. Ask Blackburn, who lost David Bentley to White Hart Lane, how much affinity they have for Tottenham.</p> <p>Whatever price was extracted for Berbatov would have to be reinvested under the pressure of an impending transfer deadline of September 1. In the sunniest circumstance, Levy would already have agreed a deal or two that can instantly be activated. Outsiders, all the same, are unsure if Zenit St Petersburg are quite so compliant as to hand over Andrei Arshavin, who appears to be the prime target, without more haggling.</p> <p>Jose Mourinho ruled out a bid of his own to take the Russia forward to Internazionale when he observed that Arshavin was \"switched off\" in the Euro 2008 semi-final with Spain. Some do wonder about the temperament of a footballer who, at 27, has only recently made his name in world football. Tottenham, with the need to complete their business by next Monday, lack credible alternatives since many targets are no longer available.</p> <p>Levy fully deserves the respect he receives from many Spurs supporters for his wisdom in keeping the club's finances in good shape while others in the Premier League flounder. When it comes to someone like Berbatov, though, any extra sums prised out of United will not justify the delay in buying a successor to the Bulgarian.</p> <p>Perhaps all players like him, who sign a contract in their mid-20s, should by right have a release clause inserted since they are of an age when a valuation is easier to make. Such mechanisms do exist in Spain but the usual stratospheric figure is intended as a deterrent. Would Tottenham's interests have been harmed all that much if, in 2006, an agreement had been struck that, each summer, he would have the option of leaving for, say, \u00a320m?</p> <p>A Europe-wide system of that sort, after all, would let men like Levy and Ramos acquire other footballers on the same basis. The Sunderland manager, Roy Keane, oversimplified the issue, but he was right about the urgency of selling men who no longer want to play for you. As it is, Tottenham are under stress. The only fate worse than losing Berbatov now may be retaining this moody virtuoso in a surly frame of mind.</p>",
  "<p>Europe's motor industry is still a long way from meeting EU targets for cutting carbon dioxide emissions from new cars and governments must increase pressure on carmakers to comply, green transport campaigners warned yesterday.</p> <p>Transport &amp; Environment (T&amp;E), a pan-European lobby group, accused the industry of fighting tooth and nail - with government support - to water down the proposed EU emission limits.</p> <p>T&amp;E said the 14 top carmakers in the European market still had to cut engine emissions by 17% to reach the EU's 2012 target of 130 grams a kilometre.</p> <p>Its new study, which is based on official data supplied to the European commission, provides scant evidence that European consumers are switching en masse to low-emission, more fuel-efficient cars.</p> <p>However, Jos Dings, T&amp;E director, said that some manufacturers were showing signs of responding to the threat of increased regulation, with German carmaker BMW cutting emissions from its fleet by an average 7.3% in 2007 through its \"efficient dynamics\" programme.</p> <p>\"With the threat of legislation looming, BMW has shown that even premium carmakers can seriously reduce CO2. But the slow response of most carmakers shows that the EU needs to keep up the pressure with challenging long-term CO2 targets,\" Dings said. T&amp;E wants an emissions target of 80g/km for all new cars by 2020 against the 158g achieved last year. In its drive to make the EU the world's first low-carbon economy, the commission has proposed that CO2 emissions from new cars be cut to 130g/km by 2012, with a further 10g reduction to come from alternative fuels. Targets for carmakers vary according to the weight of the average vehicle produced.</p> <p>Carbon emissions from transport in the EU increased by 35% between 1990 and 2006 and account for 28% of all emissions with cars responsible for half of these.</p> <p>But after ferocious lobbying from the German car industry, the chancellor, Angela Merkel, struck a deal this summer with French president Nicolas Sarkozy for the target reductions in car emissions to be phased in until 2015. They also agreed to water down the penalties for breaching the emissions limit.</p> <p>Urging EU governments to retain the targets and penalties, Dings said: \"German carmakers want CO2 targets to apply only to the cleanest cars in the early years. It's like demanding that smoking ban should apply initially only to non-smokers.\"</p> <p>The T&amp;E figures, which are the most up-to-date, show French groups Peugeot-Citro\u00ebn and Renault closest to reaching the proposed limits but still falling 10% and 14% short respectively, with Italy's Fiat close behind. Three Japanese firms - Nissan, Mazda and Suzuki - are among the four with the biggest gap to make up. </p> <p>The T&amp;E findings are published before debates on the legislation in European parliament's industry and environment committees next month. The auto industry lobby had drafted the amendments tabled by sympathetic MEPs, Dings said.</p> <p>Caroline Lucas, Green MEP and environment committee member, said the T&amp;E figures were \"disastrous\" and accused other MEPs and governments of blocking at every turn efforts to impose more ambitious targets.</p>",
  "<p>In his book Late Victorian Holocausts, Mike Davis tells the story of the famines that sucked the guts out of India in the 1870s. The hunger began when a drought, caused by El Ni\u00f1o, killed the crops on the Deccan plateau. As starvation bit, the viceroy, Lord Lytton, oversaw the export to England of a record 6.4m hundredweight of wheat. While Lytton lived in imperial splendour and commissioned, among other extravagances, \"the most colossal and expensive meal in world history\", between 12 million and 29 million people died. Only Stalin manufactured a comparable hunger.</p> <p>Now a new Lord Lytton is seeking to engineer another brutal food grab. As Tony Blair's favoured courtier, Peter Mandelson often created the impression that he would do anything to please his master. Today he is the European trade commissioner. From his sumptuous offices in Brussels and Strasbourg, he hopes to impose a treaty that will permit Europe to snatch food from the mouths of some of the world's poorest people.</p> <p>Seventy per cent of the protein eaten by the people of Senegal comes from fish. Traditionally cheaper than other animal products, it sustains a population that ranks close to the bottom of the human development index. One in six of the working population is employed in the fishing industry; about two-thirds of these workers are women. Over the past three decades, their means of subsistence has started to collapse as other nations have plundered Senegal's stocks.</p> <p>The EU has two big fish problems. One is that, partly as a result of its failure to manage them properly, its own fisheries can no longer meet European demand. The other is that its governments won't confront their fishing lobbies and decommission all the surplus boats. The EU has tried to solve both problems by sending its fishermen to west Africa. Since 1979 it has struck agreements with the government of Senegal, granting our fleets access to its waters. As a result, Senegal's marine ecosystem has started to go the same way as ours. Between 1994 and 2005, the weight of fish taken from the country's waters fell from 95,000 tonnes to 45,000 tonnes. Muscled out by European trawlers, the indigenous fishery is crumpling: the number of boats run by local people has fallen by 48% since 1997.</p> <p>In a recent report on this pillage, ActionAid shows that fishing families that once ate three times a day are now eating only once or twice. As the price of fish rises, their customers also go hungry. The same thing has happened in all the west African countries with which the EU has maintained fisheries agreements. In return for wretched amounts of foreign exchange, their primary source of protein has been looted.</p> <p>The government of Senegal knows this, and in 2006 it refused to renew its fishing agreement with the EU. But European fishermen - mostly from Spain and France - have found ways round the ban. They have been registering their boats as Senegalese, buying up quotas from local fishermen and transferring catches at sea from local boats. These practices mean that they can continue to take the country's fish, and have no obligation to land them in Senegal. Their profits are kept on ice until the catch arrives in Europe.</p> <p>Mandelson's office is trying to negotiate economic partnership agreements with African countries. They were supposed to have been concluded by the end of last year, but many countries, including Senegal, have refused to sign. The agreements insist that European companies have the right both to establish themselves freely on African soil, and to receive national treatment. This means that the host country is not allowed to discriminate between its own businesses and European companies. Senegal would be forbidden to ensure that its fish are used to sustain its own industry and to feed its own people. The dodges used by European trawlers would be legalised.</p> <p>The UN's Economic Commission for Africa has described the EU's negotiations as \"not sufficiently inclusive\". They suffer from a \"lack of transparency\" and from the African countries' lack of capacity to handle the legal complexities. ActionAid shows that Mandelson's office has ignored these problems, raised the pressure on reluctant countries and \"moved ahead in the negotiations at a pace much faster than the [African nations] could handle\". If these agreements are forced on west Africa, Lord Mandelson will be responsible for another imperial famine.</p> <p>This is one instance of the food colonialism that is again coming to govern the relations between rich and poor counties. As global food supplies tighten, rich consumers are pushed into competition with the hungry. Last week the environmental group WWF published a report on the UK's indirect consumption of water, purchased in the form of food. We buy much of our rice and cotton, for example, from the Indus valley, which contains most of Pakistan's best farmland. To meet the demand for exports, the valley's aquifers are being pumped out faster than they can be recharged. At the same time, rain and snow in the Himalayan headwaters have decreased, probably as a result of climate change. In some places, salt and other crop poisons are being drawn through the diminishing water table, knocking out farmland for good. The crops we buy are, for the most part, freely traded, but the unaccounted costs all accrue to Pakistan.</p> <p>Now we learn that Middle Eastern countries, led by Saudi Arabia, are securing their future food supplies by trying to buy land in poorer nations. The Financial Times reports that Saudi Arabia wants to set up a series of farms abroad, each of which could exceed 100,000 hectares. Their produce would not be traded: it would be shipped directly to the owners. The FT, which usually agitates for the sale of everything, frets over \"the nightmare scenario of crops being transported out of fortified farms as hungry locals look on\". Through \"secretive bilateral agreements\", the paper reports, \"the investors hope to be able to bypass any potential trade restriction that the host country might impose during a crisis\".</p> <p>Both Ethiopia and Sudan have offered the oil states hundreds of thousands of hectares. This is easy for the corrupt governments of these countries: in Ethiopia the state claims to own most of the land; in Sudan an envelope passed across the right desk magically transforms other people's property into foreign exchange. But 5.6 million Sudanese and 10 million Ethiopians are currently in need of food aid. The deals their governments propose can only exacerbate such famines.</p> <p>None of this is to suggest that the poor nations should not sell food to the rich. To escape from famine, countries must enhance their purchasing power. This often means selling farm products, and increasing their value by processing them locally. But there is nothing fair about the deals I have described. Where once they used gunboats and sepoys, the rich nations now use chequebooks and lawyers to seize food from the hungry. The scramble for resources has begun, but - in the short term, at any rate - we will hardly notice. The rich world's governments will protect themselves from the political cost of shortages, even if it means that other people must starve. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.monbiot.com\">monbiot.com</a></p>",

  "<h2>Oh! What a lovely war we've started</h2> <p>It was a case of the \"home edders\" v the sceptics. Our cover story last week - <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/aug/19/schools.education\">No school like home</a> - provoked a battle between staunch advocates of home education and traditionalists who insisted a classroom was a better place to learn than a lounge.</p> <p>The article looked at research that claimed home education can be an \"astonishingly efficient\" alternative to school. </p> <p>And, on education.theguardian.com, the knives were out - first from home education's defenders.</p> <p>\"Earthtracer1\" wrote: \"Until more than a few decide to stop pandering to the profitable establishment business that is modern schooling, we are unlikely to see the changes required [to our education system].\"</p> <p>\"Nefertare\" agreed. \"If I want my children to have the education I think they deserve, I'll be teaching most of it to them,\" he wrote.</p> <p>It wasn't long before some readers felt compelled to remind the home educators what their children were missing out on.</p> <p>\"MarjuaLimon\" wrote: \"I had classmates of all kinds, all types of people from all types of backgrounds, not people [chosen] by my parents among a cosy group they considered suitable.\"</p> <p>And \"Hellojed\", a teacher, said: \"It's obvious that some children would benefit far more from being educated in a home, real-life context; equally, there are some children you wouldn't dream of educating in a home setting.\"</p> <p>What about the practicalities? asked \"Superburger\". \"How do home-schooled children learn science without access to laboratories or supplies?\"</p> <p>To which \"Aspiegirl\" replied: \"If I remember rightly, at my old school the Bunsen burners were mainly used for setting fire to girls' ponytails and the sulphuric acid was used to murder the tadpoles.\"</p> <p>Game, set and match to the home educators. Or so they'd like to think, anyway.<br><strong>Jessica Shepherd</strong></p> <h2>The senior adviser on the right track</h2> <p>After the day job in Whitehall as senior adviser on Muslim issues to Hazel Blears at her Department for Communities and Local Government, Maqsood Ahmed heads for two hours of study on the train on the way home to Leicester. </p> <p>Slacking on his part would make the dropout rate 100% for Warwick University's MA on Islam in Contemporary Societies - Ahmed is the only student so far to tackle the full course.</p> <p>At the end of the first year, he says with characteristic enthusiasm: \"The course has exceeded my expectations. Even we so-called Muslim experts need to expand our understanding. Instead of just accepting the subjective view from my background, for instance, one of my tutors has lent me books by mainstream, non-Muslim academics on subjects like Islamic family law.\"</p> <p>\"I feel that this course is the only one of its kind that deals with Muslims in societies where they're in a majority as well as a minority,\" says Muhammad Anwar, one of four highly qualified academics able to provide Ahmed with one-to-one tuition. (There are other students, but they're taking one or two modules rather than the whole MA.) Anwar is research professor in Warwick's Centre for Research in Ethnic Relations (Crer) and one-time head of research at the Commission for Racial Equality.</p> <p>\"I've known him since 1999, when we were both speaking at the Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies,\" Ahmed confides. \"But that doesn't stop him putting me through it when we meet at Warwick,\" he adds with a grin. \"It can be quite brutal.\"</p> <p>Despite the ongoing threat of home-grown terrorism, Ahmed declares himself \"very optimistic\" for Britain's third-generation Muslims - substantial numbers of whom have embraced education and are making their presence felt in a wide range of professions. \"The chaplain at a top university like Warwick tells me that there are at least 1,000 Muslim students,\" he says. \"They can't all be foreign-born.\"<br><strong>Chris Arnot</strong></p> <h2>What we learned this week</h2> <p><strong>Our weekly round-up</strong><br>On the global stage, this year's Shanghai Jiao Tong rankings of research universities confirmed the dominance of American institutions, with plucky little Britain hanging in for silver. There were interesting movements within the UK contingent (see page 6), while in Asia, China's universities still lag behind Japan and Australia, and the top Chinese institutions belong to Taiwan and Hong Kong. But Beijing takes a long view and will eventually overtake Asian rivals - and who knows, even mighty Harvard. </p> <p>Back in the UK, the helicopter parents have landed. Last week, we learned that the admissions service Ucas had capitulated to pressure and allowed parents to manage their children's applications for the first time. One in 10 of this year's half a million university applicants have named a parent or guardian as their agent in the race to secure a place.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/jan/02/students.uk\">five types of helicopter parent</a> werei dentified by Paul Redmond in Education Guardian earlier this year and involve themselves in every aspect from applying onwards - open days, halls of residence, etc. The mobile phone, remarks Redmond, is surely \"the longest umbilical cord in history\".</p> <p>Parents will have been closely involved in the dramas played out over the past two weeks in the Clearing process, which seems to have been even more fast and furious than ever. </p> <p>Helped by record A-level results, acceptances to universities from students in England for 2008 were up 6% (more than 15,000) on this time last year, Ucas announced.</p> <p>A record 375,104 applicants had had their university and college places confirmed so far and the numbers who had accepted places through Clearing had also risen 11.6% on last year to 9,263.</p> <p>And a possible first?

  "<p>Precious metals are increasingly likely to be in the medication prescribed by hospitals. Gold, silver and platinum have each been the subject of rigorous scientific study recently - and they crop up in the most surprising places.</p> <h2>Gold</h2> <p>Gold is present in everything from pacemakers and insulin pumps to pregnancy-testing kits and cancer treatments. \"Gold has a long history of medical uses,\" says Dr Richard Holliday, head of industrial applications at the World Gold Council. \"In ancient China, doctors added gold flake to drinks for its reputed health benefits and it is still widely used in some aspects of Indian Ayurvedic medicine.\"</p> <p>In western medicine, it first shot to prominence about 100 years ago. Rheumatologists discovered that because of its anti-inflammatory properties, injections of pure gold (usually into thigh or buttock muscles) have some success in treating rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune disease in which joints become painful and inflamed. A spokesperson for the Arthritis Research Campaign (ARC) confirms that \"intramuscular gold injections are sometimes used to treat patients because they can reduce swelling, stiffness and pain\" but adds that possible side effects include problems with the blood, kidneys and skin, as well as nausea, so they are usually a last resort when other drugs have failed.</p> <p>However, emerging research might change that. Trials at the University of Washington suggested that as many as 50% of people with rheumatoid arthritis - which affects 350,000 people in the UK - could benefit from gold injections. A study currently under way in Denmark is investigating whether gold injections might also benefit people with osteoarthritis of the knee, a painful condition that occurs when joint surfaces become damaged, usually with wear and tear. It is thought that gold may slow down damage to the cartilage and bone, reducing joint pain. </p> <p>Tiny gold seeds are also being used in the treatment of prostate cancer. \"Gold is opaque to x-rays,\" says Holliday, so placing these seeds around the prostate helps doctors target their treatment more effectively. \"This improved accuracy allows for a more precise radiation dose and a more targeted area for radiotherapy.\"</p> <p>An American company, called CytImmune Sciences, is currently carrying out human trials using gold to deliver chemotherapy drugs. \"These very potent anti-cancer drugs are being attached to gold particles, which then preferentially locate to a tumour in the body,\" Holliday says. \"It is highly focused, so whereas normal chemotherapy would kill healthy cells as well as the diseased ones, this method targets just the cancerous cells.\" Scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are developing treatments for HIV that work in the same way.</p> <h2>Platinum</h2> <p>Since the 70s, drugs containing platinum - the rarest and most precious metal - have been used to treat testicular and ovarian cancers. Now, other forms of the disease have been added to the list. \"Several types of frequently used chemotherapy drugs are derived from platinum,\" says Dr Lesley Walker, Cancer Research UK's director of cancer information. \"Our scientists helped develop the platinum-based drugs carboplatin and cisplatin - two of the most successful anti-cancer treatments for lung, testicular, ovarian, and head and neck cancer.\" The platinum works by affecting the RNA and DNA of the cancer cells, ultimately destroying them.</p> <h2>Silver</h2> <p>Before 1940, silver was widely used as a powerful means of killing dangerous bacteria, but dropped out of favour with the discovery of antibiotics. Now, scientists are rediscovering its potent effects and colloidal silver - a liquid suspension of silver particles, sometimes called nanosilver - is being incorporated into everything from sticking plasters and burns dressings to treatments for stomach ulcers. It is also used as a preventative measure against eye infections in newborns.</p> <p>Last year saw the first study looking at how silver could reduce bacteria levels in hospitals, carried out by the Heart of England NHS foundation trust. Researchers tested furniture and equipment made by the BioCote company, which incorporates silver in the manufacturing stage. Their results showed that wards containing the silver-based products - including blinds, bins, tiles, door handles and light switches - had 95.8% fewer bacteria in the environment than other wards. There were also 92.6% fewer surface bacteria on the silver-containing furniture. </p> <p>A specialist panel of healthcare experts from various NHS trusts has been set up to further investigate silver's bug-busting powers. \"The Romans discovered that silver purifies water,\" says Matthew Harte, a polymer chemist for BioCote. \"Now it is being introduced to hundreds of UK hospitals including University College London hospital (UCLH), Birmingham hospital and the Royal orthopaedic hospital.\" Trevor Payne, facilities director at UCLH, says silver-based products could save lives. \"Many hospitals are already using them so, when you open a door or use a hand dryer, it could well have reduced levels of bacteria and a lower risk of contamination,\" he says.</p> <p>Dr Tariq Khan, director of the Royal London homoeopathic hospital's Marigold Clinic, helped to develop a product called Carnation Silversocks in conjunction with experts from Great Ormond Street children's hospital. Initially, the socks, made with silver-coated strands of cotton, were developed for patients with epidermolysis bullosa, a condition that causes the skin to blister at the slightest touch. Now on general sale, the socks have been shown to have other benefits, such as absorbing odour and, because silver has the highest thermal conductivity of any metal, will keep feet warm in winter and cool in summer.</p> <p>Some water filters, such as those made by Brita, incorporate a special silver treatment to inhibit the growth of bacteria while a water cartridge is in use. Colloidal silver supplements can be bought from health shops, although a report by Harvard University last year warned there is no proof that taking silver by mouth has any benefits. In fact, common side effects include headaches, an upset stomach and skin turning a bluish grey as particles accumulate in the body. \"It is not an essential mineral,\" says Louise Sutton, a dietician at Leeds Metropolitan University. \"We have no need to consume it in the diet\".</p>",
  "<p>The BBC's just-screened, rave-reviewed drama House of Saddam was billed as an ensemble piece but it was obviously going to triumph or be trashed on the strength of one role: the dictator himself. And the reviews for this character were effusive: critics described the performance as \"transfixing\", \"bombastic\" and \"unnervingly charismatic\". He was the main reason viewers kept tuning in to the four-part television series about the Iraqi ruler. Everybody just loved the BBC's Saddam.</p> <p>\"The minute I heard about it, I knew that I and no one else would play him,\" says the Israeli actor Igal Naor. It's a curious sense of conviction, because when the BBC was casting for the role, Naor was virtually unknown outside Israel. True, he had appeared in the 2005 blockbuster film Munich, in which he played one of the Black September gunmen blown up by Mossad agents to avenge the assassination of 11 Israeli Olympian athletes. But his screen time was, by his own reckoning, \"less than five minutes - you know, the Mossad works quickly.\" </p> <p>Naor, who says he always dreamed of playing Saddam Hussein, contacted the BBC series' casting director and received no response. Then he emailed photos of himself sporting a swiftly improvised, sticky-taped-on block moustache and kefiyeh head scarf. \"Within less than an hour they called and asked how soon I could be in London.\" </p> <p>It's not just the on-screen resemblance that made Naor a stunning Saddam. Dominating every frame, the actor conveyed with his very presence the bone-chilling, cultish charisma of the Iraqi dictator who ruled by bloody, ideologically-convinced terror. Neither was it a case of copycat acting. </p> <p>\"I wasn't interested in recreating his every gesture and I didn't impersonate Saddam's voice, which was very high-pitched, like Kermit the Frog.\" He does a flash impression of Saddam talking, a nasal, drawling Arabic that instantly turns heads in the sedate Tel Aviv cafe where we are sitting. </p> <p>His portrayal of the Iraqi ruler is \"beyond acting, it's just being,\" says Naor. \"I am him, and he is me.\" What, he is Saddam? \"Yes. I won't kill you, but it's me,\" he says. \"You don't find many opportunities to play someone that you know is you, perfectly you. The soul, the essence, we share it, me and him. I was astonished to realise that, but playing him, I felt that everything he did was exactly what I would do if I were in his place.\" We are talking about the ruthless dictator, torturer and murderer of thousands, including close friends, long-time colleagues and family-in-law? \"I understood him perfectly,\" says Naor. \"It is something that is connected with childhood, with pains that you have in your first years.\" </p> <p>Similarities between the two men's childhoods are not glaringly obvious. Saddam's father abandoned him, and his abusive stepfather forced him to leave the family home, aged 10, and live with his uncle. Naor was born in 1958 in Givatayim, a well-heeled suburb of Tel Aviv. His Iraqi-Jewish parents migrated from Baghdad in the early 1950s, soon after the creation of Israel (they were \"strongly encouraged\" to drop their original, Arabic family name and adopt the Hebrew Naor). Naor describes a happy childhood home, but relates that he grew up in \"strange conditions\". During early toddler years he was raised by his grandmother - like any Iraqi child, he says - while his parents worked. As a result, his mother tongue is Arabic and he didn't speak a word of Hebrew when he first attended nursery school. </p> <p>\"Iraqi grandmothers are obsessively clean and so I always wanted to wash my hands at kindergarten,\" recalls Naor. \"I'd say it in Arabic and nobody would understand. One day I must have just kept asking, nagging, and they got fed up and locked me in the toilet, and I stood on the seat shouting through the window, [In Arabic] 'Granny, granny, come and get me!'\" </p> <p>He grew up feeling different. \"I thought, I don't speak the language, I don't belong to you ... and life is a fight, a struggle and you have to change the world,\" he says. \"Sometimes you realise that the biggest revolutionaries just wanted to change something in their childhood that was painful - and Saddam was a socialist revolutionary in the beginning. He did many great things for his country at first, like building a health system, education and nationalising oil revenues. And then he took the country to war with Iran and destroyed everything.\"</p> <p>Naor's Saddam comprised a dimension of the Iraqi dictator as a victim of geo-politics: a classic tragic hero. The series ending, which closed on Saddam moments before his hanging, managed to evince some sympathy for the dictator, hunted down, found hiding in a hole and executed for crimes against humanity. \"When you hear his name, you immediately, instinctively connect it with evil, a murderer, craziness, and so on,\" he says. \"If I played him only as that, I would just be fulfilling people's expectations and that's not interesting.\" The Iraqi ruler clearly came over as a brutal tyrant in the series. \"My role was to build tension between the intention of the writers and my own performance,\" says Naor. \"So, as Saddam, I believe every word I say, and I believe every terrible thing I do is for the good of the nation and every mistake I make is because I can't do things in any other way, because of who I am. That's the duty of any actor playing any role, but especially this role where there is so much prejudice.\" </p> <p>While the BBC was scouting for a Saddam, Naor was on location for last year's film Rendition, in which he plays the Arab torturer-interrogator hired by the CIA to deal with terror suspects that the organisation has \"disappeared\" to a secret detention facility somewhere in the Middle East. He is currently working on Green Zone, a big-budget thriller inspired by the book Imperial Life in the Emerald City, Rajiv Chandrasekaran's expos\u00e9 of the US-controlled zone of Baghdad as an enclave of luxury and ignorance. In the film, due for release next year, Naor plays a politically ambiguous Iraqi general chased by American agents who are trying, post-2003 invasion, to find evidence of WMDs. </p> <p>Both films raise bold questions over western policy in the Middle East and Naor's own sentiments echo that. He thinks that blanket US support gives Israel licence not to do anything \"to solve the problem with our brothers the Palestinians, the biggest problem in the Middle East\". He talks about present-day Iraq, where the American administration \"just doesn't care. They only care about their interests. And the people are paying the price, with their blood.\" A communist since he was a teenager, Naor is decidedly anti-imperialist. \"I was born in a period of ideology. I never liked capitalism. I don't like people who think they can invade a country to change the regime or to kill the elected leader,\" he says. \"You are not the judge and not the police of the world. Who asked you? And how dare you? And what do you understand about it, anyway?\" </p> <p>By his own admission, Naor's concern for Iraq goes deeper than the compassion he feels for human suffering, anywhere. \"My blood, my mentality is Iraqi,\" he says, pronouncing the country with a strong guttural \"Q\" just like his BBC Saddam. \"I really know the western game well and I play it,\" he says. \"But I felt at home when I was filming in Morocco and Tunisia. I speak the language; I like the food, the Araq [aniseed drink], the nargile [hookah]. Me and my Iraqi friends [in Israel] talk only in Arabic when we are together. We enjoy it - there is a lot of humour and nuances that we can never express in Hebrew.\" Among those friends are the Iraqi-Israeli actors Sasson Gabai and Uri Gavriel, who both featured in the House of Saddam. </p> <p>In his home country, Naor is better known as a stage actor, having played countless lead roles spanning more than two decades in theatre. He is still remembered for roles in classic productions performed years ago. He is due to return to theatre later in the year, schedule permitting. Does he worry about being stereotyped as the Arab movie villain? \"I don't talk in terms of goodies and baddies,\" he says. \"I won't do roles that are just 'an Arab' with nothing interesting about it. I also just turned down a big role because the script was anti-Israeli, it was coming from a place of hatred.\" </p> <p>Despite the array of \"very nice\" roles he is offered these days, he does not think that he has achieved global stature. \"It is not an international career,\" he says. \"There is currently a wave of Middle Eastern films and it will pass. Anyway, my days of big dreams are behind me - I am 50; for an Iraqi that is beyond retirement!\".</p>",
  "<p>'The only thing better than singing is more singing,\" said Ella Fitzgerald. Perhaps such a statement is to be expected from a world-famous artist with an era-defining voice, but she wasn't the only one to wax lyrical on the benefits of a good vocal performance. \"He who sings frightens away his ills,\" said Cervantes. Even John Harvey Kellogg - Mr Cornflakes himself - had this to add in 1931: \"Singing promotes health, breathing, circulation and digestion.\" </p> <p>Singing might be fun, might be joyful and uplifting, might inspire poetry and paeans. But could it actually be good for you? Oh yes. It seems that Kellogg was on to something. </p> <p>Singing is also in fashion at the moment. BBC1's Last Choir Standing has taken it on to Saturday-night television, while this month the Sing The Nation project organised a programme of group singing events around the country that culminated in a nationwide singalong on August 24 to mark the Olympic handover from Beijing to London. </p> <p>Last year, the government announced \u00a340m of funding in the National Singing Programme to get every primary-school pupil singing regularly. And there are, apparently, now more choirs in this country than there are fish and chips shops. </p> <p>But there is also an increasing interest in the physical, psychological and emotional benefits of singing. In December of this year, the charity Heart Research UK will run a Sing for Your Heart week to raise money and also to highlight the health benefits of singing. And in September the Sidney De Haan Research Centre for Arts and Health at Canterbury Christ Church University will host a conference to explore the role of music and singing in health, social care and community development.</p> <p>The Sidney De Haan centre undertakes research and provides evidence to support their aim of getting the NHS to provide \"singing on prescription\". Professor Grenville Hancox, director of music at the university and co-director of the centre, says, \"We are convinced that it is a powerful tool. Research we've just done involving international choirs and over 12,000 people identified several particular benefits of regular group singing, including specific examples of people who say it helped them recover from strokes or heart attacks.\" </p> <p>The research available on singing identifies some key physical benefits. It exercises major muscle groups in the upper body. It is an aerobic activity that improves the efficiency of your cardiovascular system and encourages you to take more oxygen into your body, leading to increased alertness.</p> <p>Aerobic activity is linked to stress reduction, longevity and better overall health. Improved airflow in the upper respiratory tract is likely to lessen the opportunity for bacteria to flourish there, countering the symptoms of colds and flu. Singing also aids the development of motor control and coordination, and recent studies have shown that it improves neurological functioning. </p> <p>But the benefits of singing extend beyond the fizzing of synapses and the whizzing of oxygenated blood cells. \"There is an increasing appreciation that the way people feel about themselves is going to have an impact on the budgets of the NHS,\" says Hancox. </p> <p>\"If people are content they are less likely to encounter physical problems.\" He points out that feeling better through song is not a new discovery. \"There is evidence to suggest that in their infirmaries, monks used to sing to each other as part of the healing process. And other cultures use singing constantly as a means to live.\"</p> <p>There is nothing like singing for generating that feelgood factor. \"It's almost indescribable,\" says singer and singing coach Helen Astrid. \"It's an incredible endorphin rush. You feel like you've got a spring in your step. You feel like you're being totally true to yourself. It is like making love in a way. You're using your whole body, everything is involved.\"</p> <p>But as well as the sheer pleasure of opening your mouth and belting out a tune, there's also evidence to show that singing can have a tangible impact on your sense of wellbeing in a variety of ways. Professor Graham Welch, chairman of music education and head of the school of arts and humanities at the Institute of Education, University of London, says: \"There is currently a lot of interest in wellbeing and social inclusion and an increasing interest in how music in various forms can support a sense of being part of society and increase your self-esteem. A great deal of research is being done into music and medicine and how music can ameliorate pain.\" </p> <p>Indeed, research published in the Journal of Music Therapy in 2004 suggested that group singing helped people to cope better with chronic pain. </p> <p>Colette Hiller, director of Sing The Nation, is convinced that singing with other people can help individuals connect to each other, and to their environment. \"Think of a football stadium with everyone singing,\" she says. \"There's an excitement, you feel part of it, singing bonds people and always has done. There's a goosebumpy feeling of connection.\" She cites some research in Italy that demonstrated a link between the vigour of local choirs and the level of civic engagement. </p> <p>Nikki Slade, who runs chanting and voice-work classes for everyone from City bankers to addicts at The Priory, believes that the benefits of singing are linked to the primacy and power of the human voice - and our basic instinct to use it. \"People are naturally free and expressive,\" she says, \"but it's something that has been lost on a day-to-day basis.\" </p> <p>You need only watch the evolving behaviour of your friends at a karaoke night - from shy microphone-refuseniks at the start of the night to stage-hogging stars by the end of it - to see that, basically, everybody wants to sing. Though some find it harder than others to take the first steps. Madeleine Lee, a singer/songwriter, singing coach and practitioner of \"holistic song therapy\" (which uses voice work to help individuals confront insecurities and explore their creativity), says she has worked with clients in their 80s, helping them to finally realise a lifelong urge to sing.</p> <p>She says, \"There is no such thing as not being able to sing. It's the most natural thing, but you can be so conscious of it. </p> <p>It's a question of unprogramming all those voices that say, 'You can't do that' and 'You can't sing.'\" </p> <p>One of Lee's clients, Jo Finnigan, agrees that singing happily can have powerful implications for the rest of your life. \"I could already sing,\" she says, \"but Madeleine helped me not try so hard, to be able to sing effortlessly and openly. It felt much more a part of me and that carried into my life. I felt more confident about being myself.\"</p> <p>But it's not only in the realm of holistic medicine and alternative healing that the basic power of singing is acknowledged. </p> <p>\"The point about singing is that it is something we all did when we were born, regardless of colour, creed or anything else,\" says Hancox. \"All the billions of us on the planet sang and for the first nine months of our lives relied on the manipulation of our voice's pitch to meet our basic and fundamental needs.\"</p> <p>Advocates of singing lament its diminishing role in our lives: from the days when we sang round the piano in the pub and to pass the working day, to soothe babies and to mark moments of celebration and sorrow. Singing is sacred and everyday, ritualistic and spontaneous. It makes us better, and makes us feel better. And we should all be doing more of it. </p> <p>\"Even if a person does it only once a month, it makes an extraordinary difference,\" says Hancox. \"It's a staggering thing\".</p>",
  "<p>A Whitehall counter-terrorism unit is targeting the BBC and other media organisations as part of a new global propaganda push designed to \"taint the al-Qaida brand\", according to a secret Home Office paper seen by the Guardian.</p> <p>The document also shows that Whitehall counter-terrorism experts intend to exploit new media websites and outlets with a proposal to \"channel messages through volunteers in internet forums\" as part of their campaign.</p> <p>The strategy is being conducted by the research, information and communication unit, [RICU] which was set up last year by the then home secretary, John Reid, to counter al-Qaida propaganda at home and overseas. It is staffed by officials from several government departments.</p> <p>The report, headed, Challenging violent extremist ideology through communications, says: \"We are pushing this material to UK media channels, eg, a BBC radio programme exposing tensions between AQ leadership and supporters. And a restricted working group will communicate niche messages through media and non-media.\"</p> <p>The disclosure that a Whitehall counter-terrorism propaganda operation is promoting material to the BBC and other media will raise fresh concerns about official news management in a highly sensitive area. </p> <p>The government campaign is based upon the premise that al-Qaida is waning worldwide and can appear vulnerable on issues such as declining popularity; its rejection by credible figures, especially religious ones, and details of atrocities.</p> <p>The Whitehall propaganda unit is collecting material to target these vulnerabilities under three themes. They are that al-Qaida is losing support; \"they are not heroes and don't have answers; and that they harm you, your country and your livelihood\".</p> <p>The RICU guidance, dated July 21 2008, says that the material is primarily aimed at \"overseas communicators\" in embassies and consulates around the world, confirming the global scale of the Whitehall counter-terrorist propaganda effort now underway. </p> <p>But it also says that other partners should be encouraged to integrate this work into their communications at home as well: \"It is aimed primarily (but not exclusively) at those working with overseas influencers and opinion formers.\"</p> <p>The first dossier of material being despatched to diplomatic posts worldwide cites condemnation of al-Qaida from Sayyid Imam al-Sharif aka Dr Fadi, a former leader of Egyptian Islamic Jihad, and Salman Abu-Awdah, a leading Saudi scholar who has published an open letter to Osama bin Laden calling al-Qaida's aims illegitimate and immoral. It notes that groups like Hamas and Hezbollah are now keen to distance themselves from al-Qaida.</p> <p>In a section headed \"AQ has suffered military defeat in ...\" it adds \"use advisedly - avoid suggesting that AQ is no longer a threat. We are not claiming victory over AQ. We are stressing their declining support\".</p> <p>The dossier says that al-Qaida has been definitively expelled from large areas of Iraq and has lost ground in Afghanistan. It quotes CIA director Michael Hayden's claim in May that al-Qaida had been essentially defeated in Iraq and Saudi Arabia and was now \"on the defensive throughout much of the rest of the world,\" but describes this as a \"strikingly upbeat assessment of the organisation\".</p> <p>It highlights the fact that Mohammed Hamid, who was convicted in February for recruiting and radicalising young men to fight against the west, was a former crack addict.</p> <p>The document also notes that al-Qaida has to \"feed its new franchises with propaganda to keep the 'brand' alive at all costs\". It says that it is focused on Palestine - to the discomfort of the Palestinians - because it has failed in Iraq and is now pronouncing on issues as diverse as Egyptian trade unions and climate change in a desperate attempt to remain relevant.</p> <p>The \"material\" is a mixture of recent news reports and articles from Arabic, Middle Eastern and North African news sources illustrating the theme of \"AQ is in decline\" as well as articles from the New York Times, the Observer, Newsweek and British and American websites.</p> <p>The RICU guidance note says the dossier has been drafted with support from Whitehall press officers \"on how best to tailor such material for media engagements, presenting information to ministers, or to other stakeholders.

  "<p>There was pure magic in operation at the Olympic closing ceremony when the big red bus rolled into view. The choreographers of London's handover routine made public transport appear the natural choice of rock stars and international footballers. If Jimmy Page can stand on the top deck without causing serious damage to his charisma, there's hope for all of us: until that moment there was no conversation-stopper quite as powerful as saying you came by bus.</p> <p>Now that it's been broadcast to billions of people as the most positive symbol of British life, there's never been a better time to promote public transport - an improved, invested-in, less fallible version thereof - as the only sane way to get around. Services are getting better and more profitable, encouraging even greater frequency and more modern vehicles. New railway stations and lines are being opened for the first time in 40 years.</p> <p>National Express recently carried out a survey whose results tally nicely with the company's objectives, but which also, I hope, suggest that proponents of shared transport are pushing at an open door. Two-thirds of those it surveyed claimed that they were considering making journeys by other means than their car. Its West Midlands bus branch is even offering a free one-day pass to anyone who applies.</p> <p>The company's campaign slogan is Dump the Pump, though I'm more inclined to steal Nike's and say Just Do It. The idea that owning a car is liberating has to be one of the biggest myths cooked up in industrial-era history. For the incapacitated, the isolated and the most rural-dwelling, that may be the case; for the rest of us, exorbitant fuel prices could just be the thing that kicks us out of an expensive, alienating, enraging rut.</p> <p>Bus travel is like a Victoria Wood sketch on wheels. You see extremes of human kindness and meanness on buses, but the former outweighs the latter both in frequency and intensity. You are exposed every day to the young, the old, the smart, the scruffy, the daft, the warmhearted, the grumpy, the patient, the sunny in outlook. You never have a chance to forget what other people - people whom you don't know and who are different to you - are like. Avoiding other people by driving only turns you into Jeremy Clarkson.</p> <p>I was thinking about this last weekend when we visited a country pub a few miles from where we live, which is served by a two-hourly bus service that ends about closing time. The centrepiece of its recent refurbishment was the creation of a huge car park that, when full - as it tends to be - obscures the pub's beautiful vaulted entrance.</p> <p>There must be a hundred people in this pub, I thought, who'd rather drink a spritzer and drive home than have a decent few scoops and catch the bus. Where's the joy in that? I'm not advocating the mass trespass of rural hopper services by people so drunk they forget they're not actually sitting on a mobile toilet. But the supposed freedoms of car use have limits that seem, to a non-driver, too large to discount. There's the exercise you miss out on, the ability to read while someone else takes the reins, the freedom to daydream.</p> <p>My husband, while circumstances dictate, works about 15 miles away, commuting on a flawlessly reliable bus service. His co-workers crowd around him every morning, gazing at this beatific apparition that arrived at work 10 minutes before them. He's got there in one piece, he's got a spring in his step from his 20-minute walk from the stop, and he doesn't look like a drowned rat. They're obsessed with the idea that he'll get rained on, as though cars were interchangeable with anoraks. When he wanted directions to the nearest post box, he was asked: \"From the front or back car park?\"</p> <p>Word is that we have 100 months to make the cuts in energy use needed to prevent irreversible damage to the planet. Well, it's 23 years - 276 months, or a generation - since I first learned from our primary school teacher that the world was warming up because of human overconsumption. (Trust an 80s lefty pedagogue to give you the truth straight up.) The message is already old, but the action to match it has barely even begun.</p> <p>The Sustrans report Towards Transport Justice, published earlier this year, reminded government and Top Gear dupes alike that almost a third of us don't drive. Wherever frequent bus routes and, especially, tram and light-rail schemes are established, between a tenth and a fifth of passengers report switching to the service from their cars.</p> <p>If Gordon Brown truly wants to avert both a recession and the ignominy of having no legacy, he should announce the biggest programme of investment in public transport infrastructure we've seen. Reverse the Beeching cuts, the myopic 1960s programme that halved the amount of train track and reduced the number of stations by two-thirds. Implement a policy on the lines of Ken Livingstone's Fares Fair for buses across the country , so no one pays more than a pound, wherever they're going. And get everyone together on that big red bus.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Lynsey Hanley is the author of Estates: An Intimate History<br><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>When President George Bush and Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki signed a <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2007/11/20071126-11.html\">declaration of principles</a> for a long-term relationship between the US and Iraq in late November 2007, the US envisioned that the agreement would enable it to establish an extensive strategic relationship with an Iraq grateful for the blood and treasure the US spilled in liberating and stabilising that country.</p> <p>The Bush administration believed that this kind of relationship would make a free, democratic, pluralistic, federal and unified Iraq a strong and dependable ally in the American global war on terror. Furthermore, it would ensure that our Iraqi allies would allow the US to maintain a permanent military presence in their country, provide the bases and freedom of action for these combat forces to project American military power throughout the greater Middle East, and serve as a bulwark against Iranian expansion.</p> <p>In other words, the US would be able to project power regionally, as do US forces in Germany, Japan and South Korea. The administration believed that achieving anything less would be an admission of defeat and would empower our enemies in the war on terror.</p> <p>The Bush administration was so confident about achieving these results quickly that it agreed not to ask that the UN mandate be extended past December 31 of this year and stated that the negotiations would be wrapped up on July 31. Moreover, the president and his supporters said that, of course, if the Iraqis wanted us to leave, we would, while simultaneously branding those who wanted to set a timetable for withdrawal as defeatists who would undermine the gains made by the surge. </p> <p>However, on Friday, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/22/world/middleeast/22baghdad.html?scp=1&amp;sq=\" draft\" accord said to set goals for iraq pullout&amp;st=\"cse&quot;\">US and Iraqi negotiators completed a draft accord</a> that demands that the US remove its combat troops from Iraqi cities by June 2009 and from the rest of the country by December 31, 2011. While American officials argue that these timetables for withdrawing American combat forces depend on conditions on the ground, this decision will not be made by the US alone, but in concert with the Iraqis, who do not see it as conditional. While speaking with tribal leaders today, <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/meast/08/25/iraq.main/\">Maliki said that the US and Iraq have reached an agreement</a> on a final date for withdrawal.</p> <p>Moreover, the draft accord could be rejected by the Presidential Council (which consists of the prime minister, the president, two vice-presidents and the head of the Kurdish regional government), senior Iraqi security officials and the Iraqi parliament. Since most of these officials, including Maliki, and the Iraqi people wanted all American troops out by the end of 2010, it is not a foregone conclusion that all of these groups will accept the 2011 deadline. </p> <p>How did the Bush administration so misjudge the situation? Why did it agree to a timetable for withdrawal after disparaging those who took such a position as defeatists? Some would argue that the security situation has improved so dramatically in the past 18 months that a timetable has become more realistic. But on the same day that the details of the pact were revealed, General David Petraeus, the commander of US forces in Iraq, said the gains are not durable and that the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/21/world/middleeast/21general.html?scp=1&amp;sq=\" exiting\" iraq, petraeus says gains are fragile&amp;st=\"cse&quot;\">US role is not anywhere near finished</a>. And, President Bush has said repeatedly that when it comes to withdrawing US troops, he will be guided by the US commanders on the ground in Iraq.</p> <p>The reason that the Iraqis want a timetable is that there is a <a href=\"http://www.philly.com/inquirer/opinion/20080817_Iraqis_must_control_their_own_security.html\">broad Iraqi political consensus</a> in favour of a US commitment to withdraw its forces from the country, and, while there does not yet exist a consensus among Iraqis as to what the new Iraq will be, a broad consensus does exist that no genuine, sustainable Iraqi unity can develop while the government continues to be underwritten by a large foreign military presence. </p> <p>It is important to remember that Maliki opposed the surge of US troops and the US agreement to train and pay the Sunni insurgents, which became known as the Anbar Awakening. In late 2006, as President Bush was deciding on the next steps in Iraq, Maliki urged him to redeploy American forces to the outskirts of Baghdad and allow Iraqi forces to take control of Baghdad. And he has not only refused to incorporate more than a token number of these 100,000 Sunni insurgents, now known as the Sons of Iraq, into the Iraqi Security Forces, but he is also <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/22/world/middleeast/22sunni.html?scp=1&amp;sq=\" iraq\" takes aim at us-tied sunni group's leaders&amp;st=\"cse&quot;\">already arresting</a> hundreds of the members of the Awakening movement. </p> <p>In dealing with Iraq, the Bush administration has consistently demonstrated that it has little understanding of Iraqi history and culture. Just as the Iraqis would not greet any foreign armies as liberators, they are not going to accept a permanent military presence on their soil. These negotiations show that the Iraqis want to take control of their own destiny. We should let them do so. It offers them and us the best, if not the only, chance of gaining something positive from the mess we created.</p>",
  "<p>As the dust settles on the Olympic track this week and things in Beijing go back to normal (so to speak), Chairman Mao will smile enigmatically from his portrait perch over a city transformed by architecture. By now, millions of eyes have grown accustomed to the Olympics' awesome landmarks whose monumentality is intended to inspire us, to give us a setting where we may together celebrate the majesty of sport and to remind us who's boss \u2026 er \u2026 host.</p> <p>If hosting the Olympics was China's way of shoring up its strength and visibility on the international stage, than the architecture was the look-at-me muscle flexing that brought together aesthetics and political will in a peculiar dance of neo-perestroika. This time however, the meaning is quite literal - <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/08/magazine/08shenzhen-t.html?ref=magazine\">Beijing is under reconstruction</a>. The individual structures may well represent the creative point of view of a few architects, but the big picture says much more about China's determination to spell out its political ambition using the language of urban design.</p> <p>There is little doubt that the visual sensation of the massive, perfectly flat Olympic plaza and surrounding centerpiece architecture is a curated one. We are supposed to be stunned and humbled by a project that neatly manages to dwarf the already formidable Tiananmen Square. But not only is the building blitz in direct opposition to the endangered traditional small-scale urban fabric of the city, it also smacks of the kind of propaganda-driven totalitarian urban projects that have been discredited in the west, no thanks to their association with cruelty and oppression. </p> <p>To outsiders, then, Beijing's urban master planning might seem questionable, and rightly so. How is it that big name architects like Herzog and de Meuron (designers of that rara avis, the \"Bird's Nest\" National Stadium) and Rem Koolhaas (whose <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/13/arts/design/13build.html?_r=1\">CCTV tower</a> has all the subtly of the Death Star) are given such extreme creative liberties in a country where the individual expression of its citizens is routinely suppressed? What is the role of avant-garde design and its practitioners in rigidly structured political systems? And, while we're at it, where are future host cities supposed to go from here? </p> <p>Between the heavy-handedness of Beijing's architectural gestures and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/24/architecture.olympics2008\">white elephant structures in host cities past</a>, future host cities have precious little room for grand design maneuvers. The most promising approach looks at Olympics infrastructure as a reflection of what they really mean for a city: a splashy, but ultimately temporary event. To that end, construction has begun in London on a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/may/27/olympics2012.london\">convertible structure by HOK Sport architects for the 2012 games</a> that will be rescaled from 80,000 to 25,000 seats once the show leaves town. In Chicago, meanwhile, the <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/services/newspaper/printedition/sunday/art/chi-1223_best_kamindec23,0,1411925.story\">architect Ben Wood</a> has proposed a fully <a href=\"http://www.nbc5.com/news/9359352/detail.html\">temporary stadium</a> for that city's 2016 Olympic bid, drawing up plans for what is essentially an anti-monument.</p> <p>Whether this reflects the west's ambivalence toward Beijing-style architectural symbolism or a more serious commitment to sustainable construction remains to be seen. Cities, especially the kind that Patrick Geddes termed \"world cities\" in 1915, are in constant competition for prominence in the global economic system, hence the Olympic bidding frenzy. But in the race to stand out and brand themselves, cities should dispense with Beijing's \"bigger is better\" attitude and leave the car-centric, mega-city sprawl of highways to the Houstons and Bras\u00edlias of the world.</p>",
  "<p>I went to several events in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympics2008\">Beijing Olympics</a>, and one striking aspect was the message of openness to the world. The college volunteers seemed to be everywhere and ready to help \u2013 in English \u2013 no matter how trivial the request. The television coverage highlighted national heroes \u2013 like reporting elsewhere \u2013 but it has been balanced with reports of achievements by foreign athletes and interviews with foreigners who seemed to be enjoying the games. It has also been balanced with a new emphasis on other-regarding respect and civility. For example, a Chinese gymnast was announced as having won the gold medal and the crowd burst in applause, but he gestured for the crowd to quiet down because other gymnasts were still competing. The TV announcer rightly praised the athlete for his maturity.</p> <p>It's the same story for ordinary fans. By means of the lottery system, I secured tickets for several track and field events at the National Stadium. For one, I brought my mother-in-law's 75-year-old former comrade in arms (they were members of the People's Liberation Army during the Korean war). She was excited to the point that I worried about the effect it was having on her heart. After posing for several pictures with the Chinese flag, she spotted a young man with a Canadian flag and ran over to him, asking that I pose with the flag so that she could take a picture of the two of us (I'm Canadian). We witnessed Usain Bolt's world <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/17/olympicsathletics.olympics2008\">record breaking 100 metre race</a>, and my \"auntie\" changed the chant from \"Zhongguo Jiayou\" (Go China!) to \"Yamaijia Jiayou\" (Go Jamaica!). She barely seemed to notice that China didn't get any medals that evening.</p> <p>A few days later, I was sitting next to a Chinese woman with her young daughter who expressed disappointment because she had expected to see the hurdling event with Chinese star <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/19/olympicsathletics.olympics2008\">Liu Xiang</a>, who had to pull out due to an injury. But she was still thrilled to be there, and she cheered vociferously for the great performances of other athletes. After witnessing more track and field triumphs by Jamaican athletes, she asked me if Jamaica is a wealthy country. I told her no, it's still quite poor. She responded only half-jokingly that perhaps China should encourage Jamaicans to immigrate to China so they could run for China. </p> <p>Even the games involving historical enemies like Japan have been relatively civil affairs. I went to the bronze medal football match between the German and Japanese women's football teams. No one booed the Japanese national anthem, and while there were some boos when the Japanese team touched the ball the antagonism seemed mild compared to the treatment of \"enemy\" teams in football games I've attended in the UK. Some Japanese fans mixed in the crowd cheered for their own team, including one who wisely waved both a Chinese and a Japanese flag. </p> <p>But yet the image projected abroad is not one of openness. Why is that? One reason is that some foreign journalists still seem keen on reporting \"China as evil monster\" stories. But the Chinese government's behaviour does not always help, to say the least. The rest of the world will only be convinced of China's new openness once it also shows more openness to its own citizens, including critics of the government's policies. </p> <p>What can go through their minds when they sentence two ladies in their 70s to \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/20/olympics2008.china1\">re-education through labour</a>\" after they applied to hold legal protests to ask for better compensation when their homes were seized for redevelopment? It is predictable that such incidents would cast a cloud on China's international image, not to mention the fact that it seems so at odds with the government's new emphasis on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/16/china.humanrights\">Confucian values</a> such as respect for elderly people.<br> Maybe we shouldn't be too pessimistic. To the extent there is any justification for increased social and political controls during the Olympics, they are viewed as temporary measures necessary for securing a safe and successful global sporting event. After the Olympics, we can expect the broader forces for openness to reassert themselves.</p>",
  "<p>Oliver Tickell defends against <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/15/carbonemissions.climatechange\">my critique</a> his visions of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/11/climatechange\">4C leading to a catastrophic future</a>. Two casual observations lend themselves readily. First, Tickell has entirely abstained from defending his claim for human extinction from 4C. Thanks. Second, I was clearly wrong when I said that Tickell's claim for 70-80 metres of sea level rise had maxed out campaigners' scare potential because that means all ice is melted. Showing an amazing ability to raise the stakes none the less, Tickell now talks about sea level going 100m higher.</p> <p>The UN climate panel (IPCC) says that 4C will lead to a rise a hundredth of that figure; but Tickell simply claims such moderate projections are \"dangerously misplaced\". All I can see is that such facts are terribly inconvenient.</p> <p>He summarily dismisses (as \"outdated econometric models\") the analysis of one of the IPCC lead climate economist authors, when the model points out that the damage will be quite modest at 3.5% of GDP. He assures us this \"is not to dismiss economics as a whole\" \u2013 because he can find two economists who support his argument, embracing Stern and Weitzman eagerly. It is hard not to see this as opportunistic cherry-picking: Stern might have been incomplete but his work \"yielded many useful findings \u2013 not least that swift and decisive action to mitigate climate change is\" the right way to go.</p> <p>I will not deal with Stern here. Many others have pointed out that the Stern Report has seriously exaggerated the peer reviewed evidence and massaged the analysis to get his results (see, for example, Byatt et al, 2006; Carter, de Freitas, Goklany, Holland, &amp; Lindzen, 2006; Dasgupta, 2006; Mendelsohn, 2007; Nordhaus, 2006e; R. S. J. Tol, 2006; R. S. J. Tol &amp; Yohe, 2006; Varian, 2006; Yohe, 2006, see also <a href=\"http://www.opinionjournal.com/extra/?id=110009182\">my critique</a> in my book Cool It). Weitzman, who Tickell likes when he agrees with him, actually criticises Stern: \"As economic analysis the Stern Review dwells in a non_scientific state of limbo.\" Even then, Stern never did a proper cost-benefit analysis. Such analyses overwhelmingly show that strong early carbon cuts are a bad idea.</p> <p>But it is interesting to assess Weitzman's argument (My arguments are partly indebted to <a href=\"https://ecgs.llnl.gov/2008/docs/1-Energy/Weitzman_comment_090407.pdf\">Professor Nordhaus (pdf)</a>). Tickell (and many other campaigners) fancies Weitzman, because his economic argument seems to support draconian climate policies. While very technical, it relies on a fairly straightforward gist. All risks you can think of \u2013 even catastrophic ones \u2013 have non-zero risk. Thus, it is possible (if not very likely) that global warming will not only increase the planet's temperature by 4C, but 10C. Heck, it might even increase beyond 20C \u2013 which Weitzman with armchair climatology, suggests might have a probability of 1%. Since evidence for or against such extremes is scarce, accumulating evidence can only slowly close us in on their true probability. Yet, for any given amount of evidence, there will always be sufficiently outrageous risks (think 30C) that are sufficiently unbound by evidence and sufficiently close to negative infinite utility that the total net utility is negative infinity. Thus, we should be willing to spend all our money to avoid it.</p> <p>Now, in principle all economists would agree that non-trivial risks should be included in the model, and for example, Nordhaus has done that analytically in cost-benefit models (they still show that large emission cuts are not warranted). However, the Weitzman result curiously means that the more speculative and fuzzy the extreme event, the more it counts in the total utility. </p> <p>This is an argument driven by a technicality \u2013 essentially a claim that we are willing to pay an infinite amount to avoid even an infinitesimal risk of annihilation. Yet we demonstratively aren't \u2013 and shouldn't be. Civilization-ending asteroids hit the earth once every 100m years, but at present we only spend $4m per year to track them. Maybe we should pay $1bn. But we shouldn't spend everything.</p> <p>This underscores the fatal flaw in the Weitzman argument. When we allow all scary, fuzzy concerns onto centre stage, there is no end to where we should spend all our money. Every conceivable policy measure has a non-zero risk of catastrophe and so should be avoided at any cost. Biotechnology, <a href=\"http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-strangelet.htm\">strangelets</a>, runaway computer systems, nuclear proliferation, rogue weeds and bugs, pandemics, and asteroids are just a small sample of the areas each of which we should spend all our money on.</p> <p>Tickell doesn't deal with these arguments at all. As with Stern, he simply picks Weitzman because the policy conclusion fits. Tickell then claims that spending $2tn annually on large-scale emissions cuts will provide the best insurance for mankind. But this ignores that investments in energy R&amp;D will probably long-term cut 11 times more CO2. Moreover, if our goal is not just to cut CO2 but to help people and the planet, we can do even more good by focusing on simple solutions such as investing in nutrition, health and agricultural technologies. Instead of avoiding a couple of thousand extra malaria deaths in a century cases through expensive CO2 cuts, maybe we should avoid a million malaria deaths now through low-cost health policies. </p> <p>Tickell's reply clearly shows what happens when policy drives the search for suitable facts. The IPCC is simply ignored, Stern is praised for his policy usefulness, Weitzman embraced irrespective of his analysis essentially leading to policy paralysis, driven by extreme and pervasive speculative risks. Not surprisingly, Tickell ends by saying \u2013 without a shred of evidence \u2013 that his policy would be the best solution, \"even without the threat of global warming\". </p> <p>Not only does Tickell abandon his central claim of human extinction, but he also abandons his entire argument for his policy. Not much remains.</p>",
  "<p>US and Iraqi negotiators have agreed on a text covering a full US troop withdrawal and the rights of Iraqi courts over US soldiers who commit abuses, officials from both countries said today. </p> <p>The highly sensitive talks which may well have a strong effect on the US presidential contest were stepped up after a visit here last week by the US Secretary of State, Condoleeza Rice. But the draft still has to be put to both governments and the Iraqi parliament for approval or amendment.</p> <p>A key issue - and one which divides the two US candidates - is whether it contains a date for all US forces to leave the country and allow Iraq to regain its sovereignty. </p> <p>\"There is an agreement actually reached, reached between the two parties on a fixed date, which is the end of 2011, to end any foreign presence on Iraqi soil,\" the Iraqi prime minister, Nouri al Maliki, said today in a speech to tribal leaders in the Green Zone. </p> <p>His statement did not make clear whether the date is definite or merely an \"aspirational\" target, the epithet used by Rice last week. \"An open time limit is not acceptable in any security deal that governs the presence of the international forces,\" he added, perhaps hinting that it would be the Iraqi government and parliament who would have to insist that the US tie itself down to a firm timetable or risk not getting an agreement.\"</p> <p>President Bush had been hoping to get an open-ended pact to keep troops in Iraq for several more years as proof of success before he leaves office. </p> <p>Iraqi officials have made a number of other tough demands: a requirement that US troops end patrols of Iraqi towns and villages by the end of June next year, an Iraqi veto over all US military operations including raids and arrests of Iraqis, and no judicial immunity for US troops. </p> <p>A State Department spokesman Robert Wood confirmed there had been a draft agreement but said it needed to \"go through a number of levers in the Iraqi political system\". \"Until we have a deal, we don't have a deal,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>Russia's president Dmitry Medvedev today said it would be \"no great loss\" if Nato decided to call off its relationship with Moscow, adding that the Kremlin was unconcerned by possible sanctions from the west over its invasion of Georgia.</p> <p>Medvedev said ties with Nato had \"worsened sharply\" following the war in Georgia earlier this month, which he said came from Georgian \"aggression\".</p> <p>\"We are ready to take any decision [from Nato], up to halting relations altogether,\" Medvedev declared. </p> <p>Speaking in Sochi, where he was meeting Russia's hawkish ambassador to Nato, Dmitry Rogozin, Medvedev said \"collaboration\" with Nato was more in the alliance's interests than Russia's. \"If this breaks nothing terrible will happen to us,\" he noted.</p> <p>Medvedev's comments signal a further deterioration in Russia's already fraught relations with the west. He spoke after MPs from Russia's upper and lower houses voted this morning to back independence for Georgia's breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.</p> <p>France's president Nicholas Sarkozy has convened a special EU meeting on Georgia to consider future relations with Moscow. It comes amid growing European dismay at Russia's failure to comply with the ceasefire agreement and pull out all of its troops. The US vice president, Dick Cheney, will also visit Tbilisi next week.</p> <p>Yesterday the Germans - who together with the rest of the EU, continue to insist on Georgia's territorial integrity - condemned the Russian votes as unhelpful. They were \"in no way appropriate to either calming or defusing tensions,\" the German government said. </p> <p>Russia's upper house, or Federation Council, voted 130-0 to call on Medvedev to support South Ossetia and Abkhazia's independence. The Duma passed the same motion 447-0. Both houses are known for their slavish loyalty to the Kremlin.</p> <p>Several MPs compared Georgia's president Mikheil Saakashvili to Hitler - likening his incursion earlier this month into South Ossetia to the Nazi's 1941 invasion of the Soviet Union. The Abkhaz leader Sergei Bagapsh thanked Medvedev for his \"courageous\" support, adding: \"It's a historic day.\" </p> <p>Russia has previously stopped short of recognizing the regions' independence. But Moscow is now likely to use the votes to pressure the international community to accept that Abkhazia and South Ossetia are no different from Kosovo - which won US-backed independence in February, despite vehement opposition from Russia and Belgrade.</p> <p>Russia's foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, recently indicated a change by saying that Georgia could \"forget about\" its territorial integrity. But promoting separatism in the Caucasus holds dangers for Russia - which faces growing insurgencies in its own southern ethnic republics, and has fought two brutal wars battling separatism in Chechnya.</p> <p>One analyst yesterday said he though it unlikely the Kremlin would unilaterally recognise South Ossetia and Abkhazia's independence. \"This would be more troublesome and problematic for Russia,\" Fyodor Lukyanov, the editor-in-chief of Russia in Global Affairs said.</p> <p>Russia's preferred \"scenario\" would be for both territories to eventually win Kosovo-style acceptance, he said, rather than suffer the lingering unresolved fate of Turkish-backed North Cyprus. \"My guess is that this vote is a means to achieve better conditions for international negotiations,\" he added.<br> Georgia national security council secretary, Alexander Lomaia, said the Kremlin would isolate itself if it recognised the regions, which have enjoyed de facto independence since civil wars in the early 1990s.</p> <p>\"If it does this Russia will further isolate itself from the entire world, and will force the international community to seek more active ways to restore the territorial integrity of Georgia,\" he told Reuters.</p> <p>Georgia today said Russian troops continued to occupy much of the country. In the Black Sea port of Poti, Russian soldiers rolled into the port terminal and took away computers and photocopiers in armoured personnel carriers, Georgian officials said.</p> <p>The deputy chief of Russia's army staff, Colonel General Anatoly Nogovitsyn, said his troops were merely performing peacekeeping duties. He said the EU-brokered ceasefire deal allowed them to be there, despite the fact it calls for Russian forces to go back to the positions they occupied before the war started.</p> <p>Nogovitsyn said Russian troops were needed in Poti, not least because of the arrival in the area of Nato ships. \"The fact that there are nine western warships in the Black Sea cannot but be a cause for concern,\" he suggested.</p>",
  "<p>A British-built solar-powered spy plane has set an unofficial world record for the longest continuous flight.</p> <p>The uncrewed Zephyr aircraft stayed aloft for 82 hours and 37 minutes by storing solar energy collected during the day in a rechargeable battery which powered the plane's two propellers at night.</p> <p>The flight, at the US army's Yuma ground in Arizona, was aimed at testing Zephyr's ability to relay ground communications, so the flight did not fulfill all the technical requirements of a world record attempt.</p> <p>But by operating over three day-night cycles, the aircraft's designers at the UK defence firm <a href=\"http://qinetiq.com/\">Qinetiq</a> believe it could essentially operate indefinitely. </p> <p>\"We think the aircraft in future will be capable of weeks or months duration,\" said Paul Davey, Zephyr's business development director at Qinetiq. The flight \u2013 which was partly autonomous and partly controlled from satellite \u2013 took place between July 28 and 31.</p> <p>Davey said the technical challenge in creating Zephyr was to produce an aircraft that is exceptionally light, but strong enough to carry its payload up to a cruising height of around 60,000 feet \u2013 twice the altitude of a commercial airliner.</p> <p>Zephyr has a carbon fibre frame and is covered in super-light solar arrays that are thinner than paper. The rechargeable battery it uses is twice as efficient as any other in the world. To make take-off simpler, the 30kg aircraft with a wingspan of 18 metres is launched be three people holding it above their heads as they run forward.</p> <p>It flies relatively slowly at 70 miles per hour and because of its low mass and low drag in the thin air at high altitude it needs very little power \u2013 equivalent to three or four lightbulbs.</p> <p>Zephyr can carry a payload of around 2kg \u2013 too small to act as a bomber. It is designed to relay radio messages from troops on the ground, but also to give the military enhanced surveillance.</p> <p>Unlike satellites that get a snapshot of a particular spot just twice in a 24-hour period, Zephyr can circle slowly overhead giving a constant bird's eye view of a location on the ground, such as an enemy military facility.</p> <p>\"They can perform those dangerous jobs, or jobs where you just can't get a manned aircraft,\" said Davey.</p> <p>He said Zephyr also will have important scientific applications \u2013 for example, it could follow the path of a developing hurricane, flying above the storm and dropping small devices that record wind speed, temperature and air pressure.</p> <p>Its main limitation though is sun. The shortness of the winter day at high latitudes, means that it cannot fly in winter any further north or south than 40 degrees \u2013 the latitude of southern Europe.</p> <p>The UK Ministry of Defence has funded the \u00a320m development of Zephyr to date. Ultimately, Qinetiq aims to produce the aircraft for around \u00a3500,000 per plane. The US military funded the test flight in Arizona.</p> <p>The current official world record for uncrewed flight stands at 30 hours and 24 minutes, was set by Global Hawk in 2001. That aircraft was the first autonomous vehicle to fly non-stop across the Pacific Ocean. Qinetiq is also involved in a project to develop the Vulture aircraft for the US military which is designed to fly non-stop for 5 years.</p>",
  "<p>David Miliband's claim that Nato last week agreed the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/20/georgia.nato\">\"formal process</a>\" of bringing Georgia into membership \u2013 which was immediately <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/21/nato.russia\">contradicted</a> by the organisation's own general secretary, Jaap de Hoop Scheffer \u2013 is the latest of a series of contradictory signals from Britain's foreign secretary.</p> <p>Coming in the same week as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/19/davidcameron.conservatives\">Nick Brown</a>, one of Gordon Brown's closest confidantes, wrote that he did not back Georgia's membership and did not know anyone who does, it reveals the incoherence of Labour's post-Blair foreign policy.</p> <p>When Miliband was first appointed as foreign secretary he initially signalled a break from the Anglo-American imperialism of his predecessors. In his first interview he spoke of the need to \"see the world through Indian eyes\", a reference to the concerns of the global south and the growing importance of their emerging economies. </p> <p>Since Goldman Sachs first grouped the nations of Brazil, Russia, India and China together based on two shared characteristics \u2013 large populations and rapid economic growth \u2013 the so-called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRIC\">Bric nations</a> have been moving towards a real political alliance. A summit, <a href=\"http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/markets/russia/article3941462.ece\">hosted by Russia</a>, this May led to the first political declaration by the Bric bloc \u2013 which was strongly at variance with current US foreign policy. </p> <p>Both Brazil and India share Russia and China's hostility to international military intervention and have tended to vote against resolutions authorising such actions on the UN security council. But as democracies, with left-of-centre governments, they should be Labour's natural allies, particularly if Britain would take more of a lead in addressing their concerns about world trade and global governance.</p> <p>Yet in Miliband's first major <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/feb/12/foreignpolicy.iraq\">speech on foreign policy</a>, this February, he went even further than Blair in endorsing the interventionist doctrine saying that \"something strange happened\" in the 1990s when \"the neoconservative movement seemed more certain about spreading democracy around the world\" than the left. He followed up this completely historically inaccurate assertion by saying that the failures in Iraq had all been down to postwar planning and that future \"interventions in other countries must be more subtle, better planned, and if possible undertaken with the agreement of multilateral institutions\". It is difficult to think of a worse signal to have sent to the rest of the world.</p> <p>In the wake of the devastating cyclone that hit Burma in May Miliband hinted that he was considering using the British military to deliver aid by force \u2013 a quite extraordinary statement given Britain's current military capacity and commitments and Burma's proximity to China.</p> <p>Foreign ministers have a difficult job because their statements need to be weighed for both their domestic and international political impact. They also need to construct a consistent narrative so that, for example, they are not lecturing other countries about human rights while being complicit in the torture of prisoners themselves.</p> <p>This has been at the heart of the dilemma facing successive British foreign secretaries since George Bush began his \"war on terror\" and, to be fair to Miliband, he inherited a set of problems over which he had no control. Neither can foreign ministers pursue policies in isolation from their prime minister and Robin Cook's defiance of Blair over the international criminal court's statute was probably the last demonstration of such independence.</p> <p>Unfortunately, since Miliband all but announced his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/29/davidmiliband.labour\">candidature for the Labour leadership</a> last month, every single instance of perceived differences between him and Brown is coming under the political microscope.</p> <p>His initial response to Russia's invasion of Georgia was actually very well-measured. He correctly condemned it as an aggressive violation of international law and Georgian sovereignty. \"China and the Non-Aligned Movement will be surprised by this new position,\" he caustically noted. He also stated that Georgia's application for Nato membership should remain on track, but he warned against calls for Russia's isolation saying that \"Our response should be to welcome them into systems such as the World Trade Organisation.\"</p> <p>In perhaps the most significant passage he argued: \"I do not support Russia's expulsion from the G8: that would encourage Russian sense of victimhood, fuel Russian revanchism, and allow the Russians to position themselves as the champion of reform for those currently outside the G8.\" Well quite, but splitting Nato hardly sends out the best signals either.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/aug/01/gordonbrown.labour\">Opinion polls</a> show that people do not know what Miliband stands for and this is because he is simultaneously arguing contradictory positions. I would probably have supported him if he had stood for the leadership of the Labour party against Brown last year. A proper election would have helped both candidates to clarify their respective political positions. Now the problem is that we simply do not know when Miliband says something if he is speaking on Brown's behalf, positioning himself against him, or just making it up as he goes along. That is a rather worrying drawback in a foreign secretary in our nuclear age.</p> <p>Most people who know Miliband say that he is an extremely talented, clever and affable person, so it grieves me to say it, but when Brown returns from his holiday, his first task should be to be sack him. </p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Preamble:</strong> The Ride of the Valkyries booming out from the Tannoy. A smattering of players warming up half-heartedly on the pitch. The GU MBM cheerleaders (currently nameless, though any offers gratefully accepted) strutting their stuff. The pitter-patter of <a href=\" http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=sCM0tP19_pQ&amp;feature=related\">parachutists gently landing of the roof</a> of the stand. Bovril singing fingers through a plastic cup. A flick through the programme. A longer flick through the fanzine. Unwrapping the first 'lucky mint'. Sit down. Stand up. Ride of the Valkyries fades, something for the kids - most likely Bodyrockers' I Like The Way You Move or something by the Fratellis or Hard-Fi - cranks up. Hairs standing up. Goosebumps. Butterflies. Ah, the pre-match build-up - interminable, occasionally irritating, often ludicrous. Why can't they just cut out all the blather and nonsense and get straight to the teams:</p> <p><strong>Portsmouth:</strong> James, Kaboul, Campbell, Distin, Johnson, Diop, Davis, Diarra, Armand Traore, Crouch, Defoe. Subs: Ashdown,<br>Lauren, Hreidarsson, Thomas, Utaka, Mvuemba, Sahar.<br><strong>Man Utd:</strong> Van der Sar, Brown, Ferdinand, Vidic, O'Shea,<br>Fletcher, Anderson, Scholes, Evra, Rooney, Tevez. Subs: Kuszczak, Neville, Fabio Da Silva, Rafael Da Silva, Gibson,<br>Campbell, Possebon.<br><strong>Referee: </strong>Chris Foy (Merseyside)</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>So what does that mean?</strong> O'Shea, Tevez and Anderson replacing Giggs, Carrick and Campbell for the visitors, Traor\u00e9 for Kranjcar for the hosts, who by the way, have been beaten by United only once in their last five meetings at Fratton Park. Pompey may be playing five at the back with Kaboul, Distin and Campbell as the central three, or they may stick Diop wide right and Traor\u00e9 wide left.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>This is the third meeting between the sides in the last two months</strong>, with United winning in Nigeria in a friendly and at Wemberlee in the Community Shield. Teams are lining up for the official Fifa handshake - which, by the by, has been extended to all teams in the Football League, I believe. Has anyone seen this at Sincil Bank or Christie Park? How ridiculous does it look? It's lame (does anyone use that word anymore?) even at the big Premier League grounds. Seconds to kick-off.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>Peep!</strong> Defoe and co get things underway.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>14 sec:</strong> Diop, who is operating wide right, pings a shot just wide with Van der Sar scrambling. What a start that would've been.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>1 min:</strong> First Crouchy comedy moment of the evening: the big man with the good touch attempts one of his gangly overhead efforts, but Ferdinand has nipped the ball away, leaving the Portsmouth striker flailing at mid-air. Poetry in motion.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>3 min:</strong> Wes Brown finds acres - <em>acres</em> - down the right and crosses for Rooney, who works a yard of space then thumps the ball into James's midriff from 12 yards. A foot or two either side of the keeper and that would've been 1-0.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>5 min:</strong> The bells, the bells! The Pompey chimes do lend Fratton Park its own unique atmosphere, but I wouldn't want to be sat next to the chief ringer. Evra thinks he's won a corner, but it's a goal kick.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>7 min:</strong> Traore, <a href=\"http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&amp;friendID=113577691\">a man with no heroes</a>, has a brief foray down the left, but it's comfortably dealt with by the champions.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>10 min:</strong> Horrible mistake from Distin, presenting Tevez with the ball. The centre-half attempts to redeem himself by booting the United player up in the air. Kaboul has to make a timely interception from the free-kick with Rooney closing in.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>12 min:</strong> O'Shea catches Defoe and it's a free-kick to Pompey, central, on the edge of the centre circle. Part cleared, then Diarra scuffs his shot.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>15 min:</strong> \"Can you explain in a David Pleat-esque style the shape of Manchester United's team tonight?\" asks Tim Bailey. \"Has Lord Ferg employed Evra down the wing, or do Portsmouth have the frightening attacking threat of John O'Pies bombing down the left flank?\" O'Shea's in the Carrick role as far as I can tell, with Tevez hanging out towards the left, Anderson on the right. It's pretty fluid, though.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>17 min:</strong> \"There's also a bizarre two-minute procedure <a href=\"http://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/worldwideprograms/footballforhope/fairplay/postmatch.html \">outlined here</a>,\" writes Andrew Goudie. Click on that link, folks, it really is comedy gold. Diop lunges in on Tevez and gets a booking for his troubles. Free-kick to United, which Rooney lays off, Scholes spanks and James saves.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>18 min:</strong> \"If United were to sign Berbatov,\" writes Matt Wilde, \"on current form would - or should - Rooney necessarily be his first choice partner over Tevez? Thought I'd put it out there ...\" Interesting thought, Matt. You'd stick all three in wouldn't you? Well I would.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>22 min:</strong> Defoe caught offside from Diarra's sand-wedge of a through-ball. The Pompey striker is in in my <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fantasyfootball\">Fantasy Football</a> side, so he's nailed on to have a 'mare tonight - my boys have been slow off the mark. Some lovely slick stuff from United, working the ball from one side to the other and back again. Wes Brown breaks the spell with a cross into James's arms.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>24 min:</strong> Superb tackle from Evra to deny Crouch, who nearly gets lucky in the box. Corner to Pompey ...</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>25 min:</strong> ... from which Kaboul nods just wide. Pompey have certainly got some giants in the side and United aren't the biggest, which might explain why the 8ft 5in former Spurs man was being marked by 3ft 2in Patrice Evra.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>28 min:</strong> Defoe fails with a Crouchesque overhead volley, but Portsmouth are definitely getting a foothold here. \"I understand that it's a holiday in the UK,\" writes Brian Cruickshank. \"Did the man actaully make you come into GU Towers to do this or have they, by some modern technological miracle, hooked you up so you can do this MBM while lolling about at home?\" Nope, we're in a 365 24/7 let's-scrap-Christmas-and-Easter-and-have-a-meeting-instead working world these days. Anyone else got a good reason to be working on this typically sunny August bank holiday? Other than being in Latvia or some such.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Portsmouth 0-1 Manchester United (Fletcher 32 or possibly Campbell 32og)</strong> Oh Papa Bouba Diop! Harry Redknapp is killing you by playing you on the right. He's asleep as Evra gets round the back and crosses low. Fletcher and Campbell slide in at the near post, it looks to me like it comes off the defender, and bobbles rather apologetically past David James. Distin tries desperately to clear, but can only roof the thing.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>34 min:</strong> Evra has been United's chief attacking threat this half - Pompey need a rethink here.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>36 min:</strong> Has anyone else noticed the little Shakespearian actor's beard that Crouch is sporting? It could be old news, I've not been keeping up with current affairs what with all the Olympic hullaballoo. Pass, pass, pass from United ...</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>39 min:</strong> It's Tevez this time scampering away down the left, with Rooney just failing to get on the end of his pull-back. Johnson then pings a shot off the sizeable frame of O'Shea. Ooh, it's a corner ...</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>40 min:</strong> ... Crouch nods down, Defoe scoops over. Half a chance, that.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>41 min:</strong> Breathtaking stuff from United. Like a Ferrari Testarossa accelerating from 0-100 in five seconds. It's slow and safe on the right, then all of a sudden the foot goes down. Scholes to Anderson, Anderson to Rooney, a flick, a turn, and a shot <em>just</em> wide. Pulse-raising football. Frightening for Pompey.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>43 min:</strong> Brown booked for wanging a leg at Traore. Free-kick to Pompey ...</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>44 min:</strong> ... headed clear. 'Wanging' was the wrong word, wasn't it?</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>45 min:</strong> That handshake stuff is comedy gold indeed,\" writes Nigel Shaw. \"Wonder why this hasn't made it to the Leeds Sunday League yet?\" I particularly like: \"After the handshakes, the players wave to the fans.\" Waving? What to everyone? 'Bye bye, everybody. Despite telling us how useless we are for the last 90 minutes and how we're not fit to wear the shirt, we'd still like to part on amicable terms. Cheerio.' Are the fans expected to wave back?</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>Peep! Peep!</strong> Half-time, folks.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>The Naylor half-time dept.</strong> \"It may be a Bank Holiday today, but this is the only pro-football match, there's only one rugby match and five county cricket matches. Anyone would think top flight British sport was only interested in the corporates. Oh ...\"</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>The Press Association have given the goal to Fletcher</strong>, who as far as I can see was the only player who definitely didn't touch the ball. Ah, well.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>Reasons why it is a bit rubbish work on a bank holiday No1:</strong> Heading down the the canteen, wondering whether a Yorkie or two Chomps would constitute my half-time snack, only to discover all confectionery under lock and key, trapped behind a steel sheet. Then buying a Ginger Beer (yes, the GU Towers canteen is lifted wholesale from the 1950s) and remembering why I don't usually buy Ginger Beer. Bah!</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>\"Any comments on Anderson's new hair style?\"</strong> asks Manu. To be honest, I hadn't noticed it. We could be heading down a slippery bodyhair-strewn slope here, what with Crouchy's beard and David James' new barnet. Jamie Redknapp, by the way. believes Fletcher should be credited with the goal, which is reason enough for me to award it once and for all to one of the Pompey defenders.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>Peep MkII!</strong> And we're off once more. Just to return (against my better judgment) to our hirsutical riff, I reckon there's just the first hint of Sheareritis creeping onto Rooney's pate.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>46 min:</strong> United = hot knife. Pompey = butter. Slick stuff straight from the kick-off from the Reds, with only Fletcher's loose pass bringing the move to an end.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>47 min:</strong> Sean Davis, entirely anonymous thus far, slaps a shot well wide.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>48 min:</strong> Vital interception from Distin at the far post as Anderson homes in on Rooney's ball across the face of goal. That hot knife is beginning to look like a Global (that's one for any cutlery-drawer aficionados).</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>50 min:</strong> \"I'm sorry but Fifa's post match procedures simply do not go far enough to ensure players from both sides experience warm and fuzzy feelings about life, football and the future of our magnificent universe,\" writes an ever-so-slightly sarcastic Will Seymour. \"I insist players, managers and officials should gather at the centre circle for a giant group hug and a sing along jamboree! Afterwards, everyone can go out into the community to pick up litter and serve food to the homeless.\"</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>51 min:</strong> Portsmouth just can't get any attacking fluency or momentum. Defoe and Crouch have been outplayed by Vidic and Ferdinand and the midfield's regularly getting over-run. The back four haven't been too bad, but they really don't look like getting into it.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>54 min:</strong> \"Anderson's had his locks cropped, and he's being played just behind the front two by Fergie in the position he plays for Brazil,\" writes Stuart Green. \"With Fletcher tucking in, WE'RE PLAYING WITHOUT WINGERS, which is leaving the room for Brown and Evra to bomb on. Am I the only to notice this?\" To be honest, Stuart, United's midfield is so malleable it almost defies the old definitions of playing positions. Jerome Thomas on for Traor\u00e9.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>57 min:</strong> Anderson volleys wide, after a little dink from Rooney. \"Surely one of the most hilarious and curious aspects of the Fifa handshake procedure is that it is meant to tell the fans to 'stay calm, and remember that no matter what is at stake in a match, it is ... not to be dwelled upon once it reaches its conclusion and we leave the pitch',\" writes Ben White. \"Wouldn't that rule out post-match analysis down the pub?\" And it'd spell the end of Match of the Day, that's for sure. Hang on, maybe there's something in this after all ...</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>59 min:</strong> Thomas stings Van der Sar's palms with a shot from long range. Scholes hoofs clear the corner.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>62 min:</strong> A little Pompey pressure here - Johnson curls in a free-kick. Headed away. There's just a little too much bludgeon and not enough guile from the home side, but they're not out of it.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>64 min:</strong> Evra shimmies away again down the left, leaving Johnson trailing in his wake. Campbell makes sure Rooney doesn't get on the end of the pull-back with a strong challenge. United, well Rooney at least, want a penalty. Nothing doing.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>65 min:</strong> \"Stuart Green writes: 'WE'RE PLAYING WITHOUT WINGERS',\" writes Brian Cruickshank. \"I say 'SO WHAT - Liverpool have been doing that for two years!'\" Bom-tish for that man.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>66 min:</strong> John Utaka on for Sean Davis. Or should that be The Mercurial John Utaka. Yes, I think it probably should. Meanwhile, Scholes has a shot block after a short corner.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>68 min:</strong> More pass, pass, pass from United, with Tevez at the heart of things and Anderson almost weaving straight through the middle of the Pompey backline. Then Evra bangs in a shot - blocked. Fletcher does likewise - blocked. From the corner, Vidic heads <em>just</em> over. If United concede a late equaliser, it'll be the greatest injustice since ... (over to you, folks)</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>70 min:</strong> Diop launches a shot at goal, Big Edwin palms clear.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>73 min:</strong> Ferdinand hobbles to the touchline after a knock, but he's fine. \"It's a ridiculous rule,\" opines Andy Gray, which, of course, it isn't.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>75 min:</strong> Anderson makes way after playing his sixth game in 18 days (he was in Beijing with Brazil) and on comes Rodrigo Possebon. A late equaliser would be the greatest injustice since: \"Liverpool 2 Middlesbrough 1\" offers Ben Hendy.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>78 min:</strong> The Pompey back four step back and tell Tevez to have a go if he thinks he's hard enough. Tevez responds with a right foot drive a yard or two wide. Seconds later he wins a dangerous free-kick ...</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>79 min</strong> ... which the Argentinean curls into the grateful hands of David James. Defoe was booked there for failing to adhere to the FA's Respect agenda.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>81 min:</strong> A late equaliser would be the greatest injustice since: \"the A-Team were put away for a crime they didn't commit,\" offers Robbie Love. O'Shea bundles over Diop. Free-kick chance for Pompey ...</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>82 min:</strong> ... Diarra pings it off the wall. Corner ball ...</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>83 min:</strong> ... Van der Sar gathers, which is just as well, as a Portsmouth goal would be the greatest injustice since: \"Bayern Munich 1-2 Manchester United,\" offers David Wall, looking for a bull with which to taunt with a huge red tarpaulin.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>86 min:</strong> Scholes handles and it's another dangerous free-kick, which is idiotically taken short to Johnson, who scuffs his shot off towards the corner flag. You've got Crouch in the box, you put it in the mixer. Rule No1 that, isn't it?</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>88 min:</strong> \"I have always thought the A-Team committed those crimes,\" writes Sam Smedley. \"Look at them, they're a right dodgy bunch. One's a nutter, one's an expert in disguise, one's a thug and one's clearly a criminal ringleader. Guilty as charged.\" Diop hacks down Tevez, and he's pretty lucky to escape without a second yellow.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>90 min:</strong> Tick, tick, tick ... Portsmouth are running out of time, and there not threatening. They've scored just once in their last seven league games, say Sky, and it's no surprise on this performance.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>90+2 min:</strong> Kaboul tries to beat Rooney down the line, and , <em>quelle surprise</em>, it's a throw-in to United. Just hump the thing, man.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>90+3 min:</strong> David James launches it. Vidic heads away. United are strolling.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>Peep, peep, peeeeep!</strong> All over, Portsmouth put out of their misery - <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJzL_wyMahU\">much like this tortoise</a>.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>So Portsmouth stay rooted to the bottom</strong>, while United go fourth. Never in any doubt, really. If it had been an Olympic boxing match, then, well, errr ... No, if had been an Olympic Yngling contest then, well, no that's not it either .. If it had been an Olympic analogy, then ... er ... well, United would have been a good one and Portsmouth a rather useless one. Oh yeah, wordsmithery of the finest order. Thanks for all your emails, ladies and gents, even the strange erotic ones involving Barry Glendenning. Goodnight!</p>",

It's no surprise that a swimming gold was won by an American \u2013 Michael Phelps has collected quite a few on his country's behalf this year. What was particularly interesting about Jones's participation as part of the 4x100m freestyle relay team is that he is African-American \u2013 only the <a href=\"http://www.tommcmahon.net/2008/08/the-complete-li.html\">second black American swimmer</a> to have ever won an Olympic gold medal.</p> <p>Swimming is not a sport in which you tend to see black faces, and in the rare instances in which you do see them, they are some of the slower competitors. I'm sure we all fondly remember African swimmer <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Moussambani\">Eric the Eel</a> who took nearly two minutes (the record, set this year, is 47.05 seconds) to complete the 100m freestyle in the 2000 Olympics. </p> <p>Contrast this with sprinting and basketball, which are dominated by black athletes from all over the world. The 10 fastest 100m male sprinters in the world are all black, as are eight of the world's 10 fastest women. </p> <p>This difference has yet again raised the highly controversial issue of the influence of race in sports. Is there some kind of biological, racially orientated basis for why some groups of people do better in some sports than others?</p> <p>A couple of weeks ago I sat down to dinner with some (white) friends who gave me their take on this. One explained that black people have denser bones which, apparently, make it harder for us to float in water. The other one, who works in the sports industry, said that black people have fast twitch fibres in their thighs which enable us to run faster over shorter distances. </p> <p>Such stereotypes are not uncommon. A recent study indicates that <a href=\"http://intl-jbs.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/38/2/155\">even among sports coaches</a> \"some stereotype replication and susceptibility to natural ability stereotypes due to an overemphasis on biological determinism, and modest recognition of less immediately apparent developmental factors exists.\"</p> <p>I believe that such racially orientated theories must be treated with caution. In his book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/158648026X/ref=sib_dp_pt#reader-link\">Taboo: Why Black Athletes Dominate Sports and Why We're Afraid to Talk About It</a> American journalist Jon Etine dismisses my perspective as \"political correctness\". However, if it's OK to equate black dominance in sprinting to biological factors based on race, it also then paves the way for equating black underachievement in education, for example, to inherent racially orientated biological differences, such as smaller brains. The science behind such theories is highly questionable and, for the most part, unsubstantiated.</p> <p>There is undoubtedly a wide gap between black and white participation in certain sports. According to a <a href=\"https://swimfoundation.org/NETCOMMUNITY/SSLPage.aspx?pid=281&amp;srcid=231\">recent study by USA Swimming</a>, nearly 60% of African-American children between the ages of six and 16 are unable to swim, in comparison to 31% of white children. It seems to me that the reason for why people do better in any kind of sport is primarily cultural as opposed to racial. Biology alone cannot account for success, or lack thereof. If it could, I too would be an Olympic gold medallist. As it is, I can just about run around my local track a few times before running out of steam.</p> <p>The sports toward which black people are generally guided, or gravitate \u2013 such as football and basketball \u2013 are those that are seen as having the most opportunities for us to excel in. A <a href=\"http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=search.displayRecord&amp;uid=1999-15054-009\">1999 study by the University of Arizona</a> actually shows that so ingrained are the stereotypes about racial superiority and inferiority in certain sports that they affect not only which sports both black and white people gravitate toward but also their performance in those sports.</p> <p>The environment in which you live and are educated also plays a role. For example, how many Olympic-size swimming pools are there in sub-Saharan Africa? Although Eric the Eel was mocked for his slowness, the reality is that in his hometown in Equatorial Guinea, he only had access to a 20m pool. </p> <p>In the west, where the vast majority of black people live in the inner cities, the types of sports they engage in are the ones most suited to an inner-city environment, not only in terms of access but also cost. This may explain why basketball courts are found on most inner-city blocks in African-American neighbourhoods: they are cheap to build, require little maintenance and participation is affordable. </p> <p>There are very few swimming pools, tennis courts and golf courses built in black communities, and they tend to require higher financial outlay. Golf and tennis are usually the domain of private membership clubs, and \u2013 even with the stunning successes of Tiger Woods and the Williams sisters \u2013 are still considered white, upper middle-class sports. The USA Swimming study found that swimming ability, regardless of race, actually increases in relation to parents' income and education.</p> <p>Sports remains one area in which it still considered somewhat acceptable to make racial generalisations, and in which inaccurate stereotypes still abound. Of course, I understand the interest in why certain groups dominate certain sports. The same questions could be asked of the Chinese with gymnastics. However, as <a href=\"http://media.www.thehilltoponline.com/media/storage/paper590/news/2007/02/15/Sports/Athletes.Deal.With.Racial.Stereotypes.In.Sports-2722593.shtml\">Doris Corbett</a>, a professor and sports sociologist at Howard University's department of health, human performance and leisure studies said last year: \"A complete explanation would include sociological factors, such as geography, access to individual coaching, the costs associated with participation, socialisation opportunities, the availability of role models and the potential financial rewards in specific sports.\" I have to say, I agree with her.</p>",
  "<h2>American Cinema</h2> <p>The 60s was not a great decade for American cinema. We've already seen how, in France and Cuba for example, cinema and graphic design were able to connect with, and express, the popular mood of change that swept around the world in the 60s. In contrast, the big generic productions of the Hollywood studio system began to look clunky and irrelevant.</p> <p>At the end of the 60s, a new generation of independent US film-makers began to incorporate the stylistic characteristics and narrative elements of European new wave cinema into their own films. Themes of moral ambiguity and psychological complexity could now be properly addressed by Hollywood. At the same time, US cinema began to develop a more self-referential engagement with the history of cinema and its narrative genres. This played itself out through a series of ironic, or post-modern, stories that effectively redefined Hollywood for the later 20th century.</p> <h2>Anxiety Attack</h2> <p>The poster for The Exorcist (1973) perfectly captures the mood of anxious self-reflection that followed the hedonism of the 60s in the US. In general, the American cultural anxiety of the early 70s devolved from a loss of confidence in the utopian potential of consumer society at home, military loss of face in south-east Asia and a widespread cynicism about the moral integrity of American politics and of the military industrial complex.</p> <p>Inevitably and because of America's origins, these anxieties were played out against a backdrop of religious feeling. The conservatism of the religious right identified the hedonistic counter-culture of the late 60s and the egalitarianism of the civil rights movement as decadent and as evidence of widespread moral delinquency.</p> <p>The American project requires the belief that human society can be perfected, whether by material or ethical means. So, these anxieties were further exacerbated by the failure during the 50s and 60s of psychoanalytical therapies and of more sophisticated social-scientific understanding to make the world a manifestly better place.</p> <p>I've stressed this cultural emphasis on anxiety, as it seems from our perspective to be such an odd thing. It's as if the stockade mentality of the early pioneers has persisted in spite of the obvious material and social developments. These moral anxieties are perhaps the flip side to the narrative of American manifest destiny. It's not surprising that, in these circumstances, stories of supernatural possession should strike a chord.</p> <h2>Semiotics</h2> <p>The visible expression of these anxieties is manifest, in this poster, through a coded visual language that arranges significant elements into a coherent and meaningful whole. This process of visual coding is understood as semiotics. We learn through experience to understand these codes.</p> <p>The poster design for The Exorcist contains several important semiotic elements. The most obvious of these is the extreme contrast between light and dark elements of design. In art, these exaggerated contrasts are designated by the term chiaroscuro. This is the device by which the relative contrast between light and shade is used to give dynamic form to the objects in the picture. Inevitably, the art of shadows has always been understood as morally symbolic.</p> <p>In film, the potential of dramatic lighting and chiaroscuro effects was first understood by the German expressionist film-makers of the 20s. Their lighting effects more or less invented a film language that allowed for the effective expression of the anxieties attached to the horror genre.</p> <p>In America, this film language was transformed into the hard-boiled exegesis of Gotham as a cityscape against which the detective fiction of film noir and the fantasy world of the comic book superhero are played out. So, the poster locates the film precisely within a tradition of American cinema and also within the wider tradition of moral narratives that simplify everything into black and white.</p> <p>It's worth noting that the rain-sodden reflections implicit in the visual simplifications of the image underline the reference to American film noir of the 40s. In fact, almost all night filming in Hollywood is done with the addition of rain and light. The resulting reflections induce a kind of crepuscular vertigo of topsy-turvy geometries.</p> <p>These implicit references to the moral landscape of chiaroscuro are further heightened by the use within the poster design of old-fashioned street furniture. The street lamp and the railings conjure up a powerful, and slightly disturbing, sense of decrepitude.</p> <p>It's easy to forget that until recently our cities were full of private spaces and dark recesses. The sodium-glow of access-all-areas modernity has developed as a consequence of 24/7 consumer culture.</p> <p>The hat, coat and bag combo, worn by the protagonist, distinguishes this quasi-medical professional as belonging to an earlier age.</p> <p>The worldwide success of The Exorcist helped re-establish Hollywood as the powerhouse of global cinema. A new generation of directors was able to emerge and new types of story developed.</p>",
  "<p>When I heard that Arianna Huffington was setting up <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/\">The Huffington Post</a> in 2005, I thought it was a joke. It sounded like the personal indulgence of a millionaire socialite who \"didn't get the web\" or she'd have started 10 years earlier. </p> <p>But it didn't take long to find out how wrong I was. HuffPo, as it's known, rapidly became a major force. The Observer called it the world's most influential blog, and it helped inspire <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree\">the Guardian's own Comment is Free</a>.</p> <p>Huffington was born in Athens in 1950 as Arianna Stassinopoulos and made her initial impact in the UK. At university she was president of the Cambridge Union, before becoming a TV and radio personality and moving in with the late Bernard Levin, the sharpest newspaper columnist of the age. </p> <p>She then left for the US, where she married Houston oil millionaire Michael Huffington. And when he ran for Congress as a Republican, Arianna got into American politics. It was an interest she retained after they divorced in 1998 \u2013 following 11 years of marriage \u2013 along with a chunk of his money and his surname.</p> <p>Although The Huffington Post wasn't a personal ego trip, plenty of<br>egos were involved. Arianna got everyone's attention by enrolling lots of celebrities \u2013 initially, perhaps, her friends and contacts \u2013 to blog opinions and serious political commentaries. </p> <p>Nor was HuffPo on the conservative right, like her former husband. Arianna had moved to the left and was closer to the Democrats. As it tuned out, an independent liberal voice was just what America wanted.</p> <p>Today, HuffPo has so much content that it has turned into a newspaper, and that is how it styles itself: it uses a three-column newspaper-style grid with lots of small index pictures. It also has various newspapery departments including politics, business, entertainment and living.</p> <p>And it has Green, an ecological section that takes in the environment, climate change, \"crazy weather\" and so on.</p> <p>The main sections are supplemented by the Huffpost's Big News Pages, which bring together all the stories about a particular topic. Examples include Russia Georgia War, Iran, Barack Obama, Oprah, Apple, Britney Spears, Sex, and Green Living. If you don't see what you want, there's a <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/big-news/\">Huffington index</a> that is somewhat like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/may/12/new.york.times\">The New York Times</a>.</p> <p>Unlike most newspapers, readers can leave comments on any story, and they do. One piece on the current front page has accumulated almost 6,000 of them. HuffPo may have started hiring reporters and video makers, but the blog-based community is still an important part of the mix.</p> <p>This month, more surprisingly, HuffPo has added Chicago, which marks its first attempt at providing a local newspaper within an internet newspaper. It has local information, local bloggers, and is edited by someone who used to work for the local paper. Huffington says: \"We plan to roll out local versions of HuffPost in dozens of cities.\" </p> <p>Tomorrow, the world? Arianna has already conquered England, America and a large slice of the web, so why not ...</p>"
