  "<p>Britain's rapidly deflating housing market, the vulnerability of the City and the poor state of the public finances will drive the British economy into its first recession in almost two decades next year, the International Monetary Fund warned last night.</p> <p>The IMF used its half-yearly world economic outlook to issue a dismal prognosis for the UK economy, slashing its growth forecast for 2009 from 1.7% to -0.1%, and stressing that measures to bail out Britain's banks would take time to work. \"The process of balance sheet repair will be long and arduous,\" it said. </p> <p>Although the IMF downgraded its forecasts for all western economies as a result of what it called the \"most dangerous shock\" to financial markets since the 1930s, the cut for the UK was bigger than for any other developed country.</p> <p>Britain will be the second-worst performing country in the G7 group of industrial countries next year, the IMF said. Canada, helped by its exports of raw materials, will see the strongest expansion at 1.2%, Japan will grow by 0.5%, France by 0.2%, the US by 0.1% and Germany will see its economy stagnate. Only Italy, projected to suffer a 0.2% fall in output, will have a tougher year than the UK.</p> <p>In a separate blow, the publication of the World Economic Forum's annual league table of competitiveness saw the UK drop out of the top 10, falling from ninth to 12th. The US, despite the problems of its sub-prime mortgage sector and the need for a $700bn rescue plan for its banks, came top.</p> <p>Yesterday's IMF report was in stark contrast to the tone of its comments during the past decade, when it has tended to single out the UK for praise, both for its economic performance and its policy-making apparatus. If the forecasts prove accurate, the British economy will still be growing only slowly by the time of the next general election. The IMF said that the UK would slow from 3% in 2007 to 1% this year and continue to weaken in 2009. In 1991, the economy contracted by more than 1%, a far bigger slowdown than currently being predicted by the IMF. It stressed, however, that the risks to its forecast were \"to the downside\".</p> <p>Unemployment is expected to rise sharply to 6% of the workforce in 2009, while the slowing economy will drag inflation back below the government's 2% target by the end of next year. Public finances meanwhile are \"considerably weaker\" than at the time of the dotcom recession earlier this decade. </p> <p>Alistair Darling will accept in next month's pre-budget report that the weakness of the economy will have a big impact on the public finances, with tax receipts heavily dependent on the City and the housing market. The IMF predicted that the deficit on the UK's public finances would balloon to 4.4% of GDP next year, from 2.7% in 2007, before the credit crunch began to take its toll on revenues.</p> <p>It singled out the UK's housing market as a particular source of weakness, warning that it had experienced - together with Ireland and Australia - one of the largest \"unexplained\" increases in property prices over the past decade. In all three countries, the IMF said, prices were 20-30% higher last year than could be justified by \"fundamentals\" such as rising population or higher incomes.</p> <p>The IMF's world economic outlook said housing markets had turned down across western Europe. \"The most severe downswings have been concentrated in a few national markets - Ireland, Spain and the United Kingdom - which had experienced the most rapid house price appreciation or the greatest building booms, but house prices are slowing more broadly.\"</p> <p>Olivier Blanchard, the IMF's economic counsellor, welcomed the coordinated cuts in interest rates and bail-outs of struggling banks. </p> <p>\"There will be tough economic times ahead,\" Blanchard said. \"The re-establishment of trust or, more formally, the decline in counter-party risk within the financial system, will take time. During that time, credit to the ultimate borrowers will be limited and expensive.\"</p> <p>Robert Zoellick, president of the World Bank, said the credit crunch had also created a \"human crisis\" in many of the poorest countries, which required a coordinated response. He said the number of malnourished people was expected to increase by 44 million this year to 967 million as a result of high food prices. </p> <p>Despite its pessimistic assessment, the IMF said the risk of a new Great Depression was small. It expects 9% growth in China, 7% in India and 6% in Africa to partly offset the weakness in the west. Overall, the IMF is forecasting 3% growth in the global economy.</p>",
  "<p>The exchanges in the Commons yesterday vividly illustrated how the world has changed completely for all the political parties after the government's unprecedented \u00a3500bn bank rescue plan.</p> <p>The chancellor, Alistair Darling, found himself in the curious position of lecturing the Conservative party on the dangers of too much state intervention and rebuffing a call from his Tory counterpart, George Osborne, for the government to block bonuses to reckless bank executives. \"We have to make sure that we [do] not get ourselves into a position where we think we can sit in a boardroom and take all the decisions for everyone,\" said Darling. </p> <p>Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrats Treasury spokesman, savoured the moment. \"I have been stunned by the sudden conversion of the champions of the bonus culture to advocates of 1970s style incomes policy,\" he said. </p> <p>All three leaders are suddenly working in a very different political landscape. </p> <p>Gordon Brown, who spent six months resisting the inevitable nationalisation of Northern Rock because he was so fearful of heralding a return to Labour's past as the champion of nationalisation, has been handed a lifeline. A few weeks after members of the cabinet were considering triggering his downfall, he has secured his position in the medium term by virtue of being at the centre of a financial storm.</p> <p>\"This has given the Labour party - and Gordon - a chance to recover and we should grab it,\" one senior member of the cabinet told the Guardian.</p> <p>The extent and enduring nature of the crisis has led Brown to overcome fears that state intervention would mark a return to the 1970s. Ministers can now preside over the semi-nationalisation of big banks without fear of being mocked.</p> <p>The Conservatives are also having to come to terms with dramatically different circumstances. David Cameron faces deep challenges on two levels. Firstly, he faces the same questions being posed to all centre-right parties across the world - and which appear to be inflicting such damage on John McCain's presidential ambitions. The Tories and the US Republicans are being asked what the champions of light regulation have to say after the spectacular failure of this approach. </p> <p>That is why the Tories called for curbs to executive pay yesterday, although they argue this is entirely in keeping with their record in protecting taxpayers' money.</p> <p>Secondly, the Tories will have to examine their own tactics. Cabinet ministers believe Cameron tore up political convention by taking part in a briefing on privy council terms last week, in which the government explained its plans in private. The Tory leader is then alleged to have demanded the introduction of these plans over the weekend on television so that he could claim credit. </p> <p>\"The Tories have behaved outrageously and resorting to students' union tactics. They need to grow up,\" one cabinet minister said. The Conservatives dismiss this and say Cameron's thoughts over the weekend were being widely discussed.</p> <p>MPs on all sides of the Commons expressed astonishment at the changed landscape. The Liberal Democrat leader, Nick Clegg, said: \"There can be no doubt today marks a fundamental shift in the way we view banks and, in turn, the obligations banks have to the public must change for good: they must serve the public interest as well as their own commercial interests.\"</p> <p>Colin Burgon, the Labour MP for Elmet, saw it a different way. \"What I see is the invisible hand of the market putting its hand into the pocket of the taxpayer and taking \u00a350bn away and maybe putting two fingers up as well.\" </p> <p>George Galloway, the Respect MP for Bethnal Green and Bow, added: \"Well, the Liberals sound like Labour and the Conservatives like Communists - the kaleidoscope has definitely been shaken. But while the pieces are in flux, why don't we reorder this world? What's so wrong about the taxpayer having a seat in the boardroom?\"</p> <h2>How they've performed</h2> <p><strong>Gordon Brown </strong></p> <p>Odd though it may seem, the destruction of the global financial system has put a spring in the prime minister's step. On the plus side, he was proved right about the absence of proper international regulation, he successfully worked his international contacts and now hopes his comprehensive and expensive plan will be the template for other countries. But he faces a borrowing hangover, and a brutal day of reckoning may await as recession nears. <br><strong>Verdict: Still in the balance</strong></p> <p><strong>Alistair Darling </strong></p> <p>Calm, downbeat and often over-shadowed by his boss. The chancellor adopted a limited case-by-case response as the banks hit the rocks. A victim of leaks to the media about the rescue plans, he did not react quickly enough once details of the part-nationalisation plan drove share prices down. <br><strong>Verdict: Could have done better</strong></p> <p><strong>George Osborne</strong></p> <p>Not a man born to consensus politics, the shadow chancellor opposed nationalising Northern Rock and this week tried to get ahead of the curve by backing part-nationalisation of banks before it was announced. Adopted a populist line on bank bonuses. <br><strong>Verdict: Inconsistent - he needs to show patience and sure judgment </strong></p> <p><strong>Mervyn King </strong></p> <p>The Bank governor was blamed for precipitating the run on Northern Rock by promising to be lender of last resort. He also angered the City by taking a hardline approach to failing banks and belatedly promised guarantees to depositors. He is accused of having allowed a muddled regulatory regime to develop and has arguably been slow to cut interest rates, focusing on inflation. <br><strong>Verdict: Christmas cards may be in short supply this year </strong></p>",
  "<p>Sir Fred Goodwin was under pressure at the helm of Royal Bank of Scotland last night after the government's unprecedented intervention in the banking sector.</p> <p>As Goodwin and his advisers raced to update the market on the size of the fundraising that is needed by the Edinburgh-based bank to meet the authorities' demands for an increase in its capital cushion, speculation grew that he would have to pay the price with his job and make way for a new chief executive.</p> <p>RBS denied reports that Goodwin and the chairman, Sir Tom McKillop, were about to be replaced, while industry sources said the departure of the man who built the domestic bank into one with international reach would be counterproductive as the financial world faces its biggest crisis since the 1930s.</p> <p>One shareholder said: \"It would have been unhelpful if he had gone today. It might be that he needs to go when they actually do the fundraising.\" </p> <p>RBS is one of the eight banks on the list published by the Treasury that have signed up to its bail-out package. The others are Abbey, owned by the Spanish bank Santander, which is also home to Alliance &amp; Leicester and parts of Bradford &amp; Bingley; Barclays; HBOS, owner of Halifax; HSBC Bank - the UK arm of HSBC Holdings; Lloyds TSB; Nationwide Building Society; and Standard Chartered.</p> <p>One institutional shareholder with stakes in several of the banks said: \"That list of eight banks is a list of the blessed, where the Treasury is basically saying it will keep them standing whatever the cost. Whether that leaves anything for existing shareholders is a moot point.\"</p> <p>However, RBS failed to regain any of the share price loss it endured during Tuesday's market rout, ending the day at 90.7p, having at one point fallen to 72p. HBOS, the other big faller on Tuesday, was the biggest gainer in the FTSE 100, rising 23p to 117p. </p> <p>In practice, participation in the government's scheme does not mean the same to all those listed. Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland, HBOS and Lloyds TSB are likely to be interested in the opportunity to issue preference shares that the government will buy. Nationwide, HSBC, Standard Chartered and Abbey are more likely to take advantage of the cash being released to the money markets rather than issue new shares. In other words they might benefit from the cash release and debt guarantee but will not have the government as a shareholder, insisting on certain lending and pay criteria.</p> <p>The banks and one big building society are engaged in negotiations with the Financial Services Authority and the Treasury about how much capital they need to raise to meet their promise to increase the industry's capital cushion by 1% - a total of \u00a325bn. For some, most obviously HSBC and Standard Chartered, the figure may be zero, for others it could be substantial.</p> <p>The market is particularly keen to seek clarity from RBS, Barclays and the soon to be combined HBOS and Lloyds TSB. </p> <p>Barclays, fresh from its push on to Wall Street by buying parts of the failed Lehman Brothers, is estimated to need to raise up to \u00a33bn. John Varley, the Barclays chief executive, will not be alone among bank bosses in sounding out existing investors in the coming days to try to establish if they are prepared to stump up more. If the answer is no, the banks will have to issue preference shares to the government. </p> <p>Analysts said the banks could take years to recover and that the executives who do manage to retain their jobs are likely to find that pay packages are sharply reduced. With the government as a big shareholder, they said, banks will be forced to curb the risk-taking that landed them in trouble and clamp down on bonuses. Dividend payments are also likely to suffer.</p> <p>Paul Niven, of fund manager F&amp;C, said: \"We have now entered a new era for global banking. In return for taxpayers' money the state will gain a level of control over their governance, pay, and lending practices. Regulation will increase markedly and controls on all elements of banking practice will rise.\"</p> <p>Barclays could take \u00a36bn and a combined Lloyds TSB/HBOS \u00a35.5bn, Cazenove said, equivalent to about 25% of their market values. But the firm thought that RBS would seek as much as \u00a39bn, half its market value. </p> <p>There was speculation about whether the Lloyds TSB/HBOS deal would need to proceed given the sums the authorities are throwing at the money markets and the guarantees being offered to bank bonds to make it easier for them to raise funding. But it is thought they were pressing on with negotiations last night.</p>",
  "<p>For a century or more, the political left in Britain has said there will be no fundamental change until the state controls the financial sector; that, up to a point, is what happened yesterday. </p> <p>Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling have done what their Labour forebears could only dream of doing: they have socialised the City. Some may be tempted to think, judging by the total Horlicks they have made of things in recent days, that the prime minister and chancellor are sleepers who have spent their lives burrowing deep into the system simply to emerge when the time is ripe with a revolutionary blueprint. </p> <p>Let's be clear. Darling and Brown have taken this momentous step not out of conviction but out of dire necessity. Britain's financial system was on the point of meltdown on Tuesday night, with potentially catastrophic effects for the economy.</p> <p>One way of looking at the dawn announcement that the Treasury will inject \u00a350bn into the banks and another \u00a3250bn lubricating the wholesale money markets is that the class war is over and the good guys won.</p> <p>In reality, it's far too soon to say that. The government may choose to run the big high street banks so that the worst excesses of recent years - the absurd risks, unwarranted salaries, and short-termist approach to investment - are reined in. But it may not. </p> <p>Yesterday's statement signalled an intent to clamp down on pay and bonus structures at the banks, but there was no suggestion that the Treasury would use its financial clout to influence the way institutions are run. Some caution is justified. When the French government nationalised Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais, the directors running the bank believed the state guarantee gave them the security to take ridiculous gambles with taxpayers' money, including buying a Hollywood film studio, with predictably disastrous results.</p> <p>Everything the government has said since it was forced, reluctantly, to take over Northern Rock in February suggests that it wants to take a back-seat role. But this may be more difficult than Darling believes. </p> <p>The financial crisis will not be brought to an end by yesterday's move, dramatic though it was. Despite the half-point cut in interest rates, Britain is in the early stages of a deep and painful recession that will further sap the strength of the banks. Indeed, it is still unclear whether the chancellor and his team fully comprehend the nature of what has happened in the past month.</p> <p>There are four big conclusions.</p> <p>The first is that the long period of economic expansion that started in September 1992 with the pound's forced departure from the European exchange rate mechanism is now over. The IMF warned yesterday that Britain's economy will shrink next year for the first time in 18 years, with a risk that the forecast 0.1% decline in GDP will be over-optimistic. The way things look, that's a reasonable call.</p> <p>The second thing to disappear yesterday was the notion that the British economy could survive on finance alone. For the past 20 years, policy-makers in the UK have convinced themselves that the might of the City could compensate for the country's inability to make anything. The notion that the ever-widening trade deficit was merely a temporary phase while Britain adjusted to a weightless, virtual, financially-driven future has now been exposed for the grotesque fantasy it always was.</p> <p>Thirdly, the bankruptcy of the City also represents the bankruptcy of New Labour economics, which has been based to an unhealthy degree on a desire to ape the go-getting, deal-making culture of the United States.</p> <p>Labour governments of the past have always had industrial strategies, which have normally been based on the idea that manufacturing matters. Since 1997, ministers have convinced themselves that Britain had a comparative advantage in financial services and that therefore industrial policy should be based on giving the City what the City wants. The light-touch regulation of financial services was but one expression of the almost total obeisance to big capital. </p> <p>The manufacturing industry, by contrast, was allowed to wither on the vine, even though the idea that developed western nations can no longer compete industrially with the emerging nations of East Asia is countered by the remarkably good performance of high-cost countries such as Germany and Sweden.</p> <p>Britain would be a cleaner and more prosperous country if a fraction of the effort spent on making London safe for speculators had been reallocated to harnessing the nation's raw scientific talent into a thriving environmental technology industry.</p> <p>Finally, the dominance of the City is over, at least for the time being. What we have seen over the past 14 months is the humbling of the City: what the Greeks would have called nemesis following hubris. </p> <p>Far from using their freedom from regulation to take wise decisions that would benefit all, banks plunged into investments about which they knew little or nothing. Far from allocating capital in an efficient manner, the credit crunch that has resulted from the orgy of irresponsible lending has led to a dearth of funds for the small businesses that sorely need it. </p> <p>What we have seen in the first week of October 2008 is a broken-backed industry that promised to be at the cutting edge of the free market, but in reality cannot survive without the largesse of the state. </p> <p>When it came to it, all the bastions of deregulation - the City, the CBI, the Conservative party - crumbled because they could see the writing on the wall. Without funding from the taxpayer, virtually no bank would be safe from the global financial virus.</p> <p>Peter Dixon, chief UK economist at Commerzbank, put it succinctly when he said the plan represented \"an enormous volte-face from a government which has set great store by a light touch approach to financial regulation over the past decade. The political consequences will be massive. </p> <p>If ever an indication were needed that the Anglo-Saxon capitalist model were in trouble, a government bail-out to the UK banking sector provides it in spades.\"</p> <p>Although Alistair Darling and Gordon Brown would never have wanted it this way, they now have the commanding heights of the economy in their hands. The interesting question is what they will do with this unexpected power.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on Sunday October 12 2008.

  "<p>Supermarkets will have to abandon their focus on consumer choice and reduce or axe stocks of the most environmentally damaging foods such as meat, dairy and air-freighted fresh products, a new report warns today.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.foodethicscouncil.org/\">Food Ethics Council </a>study says improvements in efficiency of the food supply chain have been overtaken by growth in consumption, and also fail to tackle the huge impact of customers driving to shops and growth in emissions overseas.</p> <p>Emissions from the food industry are still growing, despite calls from the United Nations, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/oct/07/carbon.emissions.targets\">this week from the UK's independent Climate Change Committee </a>for rich nations to cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least 80% by 2050, it says.</p> <p>The report calls for a radical reform of the industry including two \"sacred assumptions\" that \"consumers are king\" and that \"the economy must grow to survive\".</p> <p>It also backs calls by the UN's head of climate change to eat less meat, warning that the biggest cuts to greenhouse gas emissions will come from changes to diet by eating less meat and more fruit and vegetables, rather than cutting food-miles.</p> <p>\"If we were to arrive at a position where we could do this stuff at zero environmental cost [and] zero social cost, great, but we just don't think it's very likely,\" said the report's authors, Paul Steedman and Tom MacMillan. </p> <p>\"It's going in the wrong direction despite all those efficiency improvements; the idea in the future we're going to have some magical growing system is just quite far fetched.\"</p> <p>The Food Ethics Council conducted a two-year inquiry into food supply, monitored by a steering group of leading food experts, including Tara Garnett of the Food Climate Research Network (FCRN) at Surrey university and Professor Kevin Morgan at Cardiff university.</p> <p>The report, Food Distribution: An Ethical Agenda, says efficiency improvements by the UK food sector could not prevent a rise in total emissions of greenhouse gases of 3% in the year to 2005-6, because of an increase in total consumption. </p> <p>The figures also do not include 12bn miles a year driven to shops in the UK, or emissions from overseas which have risen as more food is imported. The FCRN has calculated that the UK food sector produces the equivalent of 34m tonnes of carbon dioxide each year. But it takes 43m tonnes to produce everything that UK consumers eat and drink; both figures equate to just under one fifth of all UK emissions by production and consumption respectively.</p> <p>The report comes as the IGD, which represents the food industry, published figures yesterday showing members from 37 companies cut the distance travelled by their lorries by 53m miles, or 4.2%.</p> <p>The Food Ethics Council report recommends a new \"vision\" for the industry, including retailers not building stores where they will generate more traffic, parking charges and free public transport to large sites, and more \"choice editing\" of what shops sell.</p> <p>Examples could include promoting fruit and vegetables instead of higher-carbon meat and dairy products, selling less \"squidgy veg\" in winter, and using recipes and other advertising to encourage customers to buy produce that was in season.</p> <p>\"This is already happening because supermarkets make choices about what to put on their shelves,\" said Steedman.</p> <p>Longer-term, stores could have to stop selling the most damaging products altogether, said MacMillan, the council's executive director: \"The question is how we get there: do we get there in a nice way or as it gets too expensive?\"</p> <p>However, the report urges retailers not to abandon developing world suppliers when they axe air-freighted fresh produce, and work with them to develop alternative long-life products such as chocolate and dried and canned fruit, which could be imported by ship or rail. </p> <p>These products would also benefit local economies because more value would be added before export, said the authors. Development groups argue that imported fresh produce from the poorest countries only generate 0.2-0.3% of all UK emissions.</p> <p>As well as changes by retailers, the report calls on government to include all UK consumption in its emissions reductions targets, encourage urban food production and local processing, and use public money to encourage more sustainable food and production.</p>",
  "<p>China joined in coordinated action by the world's central banks for the first time yesterday, as interest rates were cut around the world in response to a wave of selling that swept through markets and led to the suspension of trading in Russia.</p> <p>Following a similar cut last month, China's central bank cut rates by 0.27 percentage points in a move which the official Xinhua News Agency said was intended to \"boost the domestic economy amid worries over [the] global financial crisis.\"</p> <p>The monetary authority in Hong Kong also tried to boost the local economy by cutting its main interest rate by one point to 2.5%. It followed a similar move 24 hours earlier by Australia.</p> <p>The island's Hang Seng index had earlier plunged more than 8% while shares fell 5.8% in South Korea, 6% in Thailand and more than 10% in Indonesia.</p> <p>Although the Bank of Japan stayed out of the rate cutting, the mood was gloomy as Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index closed down 9.4%. \"No one knows the bottom of the ongoing financial crisis, and investors were really spooked by growing uncertainty over the global credit crisis,\" said Kazuhiro Takahashi, general manager at Japanese financial group Daiwa Securities. </p> <p>World stocks reached a four-year low at the start of trading in Europe. The share sell-off has wiped $4.6tn (\u00a32.7tn) from the value of the world's stockmarkets in the past three weeks, according to the market information group MSCI. </p> <p>Trading on both Russian stockmarkets was halted after shares plunged within an hour of opening on fears the credit crisis would take a heavy toll on economic growth and the demand for oil.</p> <p>MICEX, where most trading takes place, was shut until Friday after it dropped more than 14% to 637.9 points in the first half-hour of trading. The RTS index, which has lost almost 70% since its peak in May, has been shut until further notice. It fell 11.3% in the first half hour of trading, dropping to 761.6 points following the Russian markets' worst day of trading on Monday.</p> <p>\"It looks like the crash in the west is happening this week,\" said Eric Kraus, an adviser to Otkrytiye brokerage. \"Until that is behind us, we cannot expect any degree of rationality in the Russian financial markets.\"</p> <p>Latin American currencies have also been taking a beating. The Brazilian real lost 5.5% of its value on Tuesday while yesterday Mexico's central bank was under pressure to rescue the peso, which has lost 15% of its value in the last three days, bringing it to levels not seen since the \"Tequila crisis\" of the early 1990s.</p> <p>One major gainer in all the turmoil has been gold, seen by many investors as the ultimate safe haven. The price rose 2.2% yesterday to reach $906 an ounce, up from $830 at the start of the week.</p> <p>Another vital commodity, oil, was on the way down. Light, sweet crude for November delivery fell $2.20 to $87.86 a barrel in New York due to worries that the US credit crisis was enveloping the globe and would hurt demand for oil. The price has crashed from more than $147 a barrel in the summer because of fears that demand from China and India could not be sustained during recession in the west.</p> <p>\"Given the stresses and strains in the international financial system, the market is fearful of a severe international slowdown, especially in developing countries,\" said David Moore, commodity strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia in Sydney.</p>",
  "<p>British universities have slipped in an annual ranking of the world's leading universities with the country's top institutions, including Oxford, Cambridge and Imperial, losing out to American rivals.</p> <p>Vice-chancellors said the UK was still punching far above its weight, but that underfunding now threatens their ability to compete against America's Ivy League institutions. Harvard, which ranks No 1 for the fifth year running, charges undergraduates \u00a318,662 a year in tuition fees while English and Northern Irish universities are capped at \u00a33,145.</p> <p>The global league table, compiled by the Times Higher Education magazine and QS World University Rankings, reveals that 22 of the 29 British universities in the top 200 in the world have moved down the table in the past year. </p> <p>Yale cemented its position above Oxford and Cambridge. The three last year shared joint second place but this year Cambridge fell to third and Oxford to fourth. Imperial slipped one place to sixth while University College London was the only UK institution to improve its position in the top 10, moving from ninth to seventh. </p> <p>The figures sparked a fierce debate about university funding on both sides of the Atlantic: in the UK vice-chancellors claimed it showed they were in need of more money to cement their position. In the US the figures were used to suggest that the most able students should consider a British university as a high-quality and relatively cheap alternative to the Ivy-league institutions for American students who are pressed for cash in the credit crunch.</p> <p>Wendy Piatt, director general of the Russell Group of leading UK research universities, welcomed the strong presence of British institutions towards the top of the list, but added: \"We are very concerned about our ability to sustain this level of success in the face of fierce global competition.</p> <p>\"In terms of GDP, the US invests over twice as much as the UK on higher education, and their major research-intensive universities are amongst the largest beneficiaries. For example, the endowment fund of the University of Harvard alone is greater than the total public funding for all universities in England in any given year.\"</p> <p>Sally Hunt, general secretary of the University and Colleges union, said: \"That so much is delivered with less funding makes the achievements of our universities and, in particular, their staff all the more impressive.\"</p> <p>China, India, the Middle East, Brazil and Australia are also investing more in universities. \"Without increased investment there is a real danger that the UK's success will not be sustained,\" Hunt said. </p> <p>A separate analysis of the figures showed the universities assessed by the value for money they offer compared with Harvard. Oxford is at number four in the table but is 31% cheaper - including fees and living costs - than Harvard, while the University of Tokyo, ranked 19th, is 85% cheaper. </p> <p>Ann Mroz, editor of Times Higher Education, said: \"Harvard may be No 1 in the world, but it costs 50% more [in fees] to attend than the No 4-ranking University of Oxford. </p> <p>\"In these troubling economic times, American college applicants would be wise to at least consider foreign universities, which have been steadily climbing in our annual world rankings.\"</p> <p>The rankings are based on interviews with 6,354 academics and 2,339 universities and on other factors including the staff-to-student ratio found in each institution. </p> <p>David Lammy, minister for higher education, said: \"Having four English universities in the global top 10 is further evidence that our higher education system is world-class. </p> <p>\"But we are not complacent.

  "<p>As scientific ambitions go, it's a big one: no less than the creation of an artificial life form. Since the early 1980s, scientists have been attempting to create synthetic cells. And apparently the final breakthrough is expected very soon.</p> <p>\"This is a critical time for artificial life,\" says Dr Seth Bullock, who chaired the ALife XI conference - a gathering of more than 400 scientists, philosophers and engineers at the University of Winchester last month. \"The field is on the verge of synthesising living cells.\"</p> <p>Artificial life, often referred to as alife, is a very diverse field of study, encompassing simulations, computer models, robotics and biochemistry. Researchers concern themselves with the reconstruction or simulation of living processes in a variety of media - including robotics and chemical systems, as well as computational modelling. It's also a very esoteric community, but their work has proven, despite much controversy, to have many practical applications.</p> <p><strong>Pieces of the jigsaw</strong></p> <p>\"There are many aspects to what makes up a living organism,\" says Alex Penn of the School of Electronics and Computer Science at the University of Southampton. \"The key aspects are production of a self-sustaining metabolism, a membrane to separate this metabolic system from its environment and an informational system, such as DNA, to support replication and heredity.\"</p> <p>Penn argues that although there has been no single breakthrough, different groups are approaching the problem of making a whole cell from different angles. \"Although we are not yet at the stage of creating a totally self-producing, self-reproducing, autonomous living cell, considerable advances have been made on individual aspects.\"</p> <p>At the forefront of the artificial life movement is a research group led by Craig Venter, the American biologist who founded the Institute for Genomic Research and who is a leading cartographer of the human genome. Venter has recently managed to insert artificially constructed chromosomes into existing living cells: not quite artificial life, but something approaching a synthesis of it. Rival research institutions are also close to fitting other pieces of the jigsaw in to place. Mark Bedau at the European Centre for Living Technology in Venice has manufactured artificial vesicles - in effect, artificial cell walls - thought to be a key step in the origin of proto-cellular life. </p> <p>Although the creation of a synthetic life form is a mainly a practice of biologists, the results are of keen interest to any scientist interested in understanding living systems and their origins. \"One route to understanding a system and its origins is to attempt to reconstruct it,\" says Penn.</p> <p>Since the movement's rise, it has often been perceived as an endeavour perused by maverick scientists operating on the edge of mainstream science. \"The alife community has always been a place where [scientific] outsiders could gather,\" says Mark Bedau, editor of the Artificial Life Journal. \"It's been seen as something of an amateur science and yet the robot being used to explore Mars uses principles that have come out of the alife community.\"</p> <p>Moreover, artificial life has produced many practical achievements much closer to home. Its ideas and principles have helped inspire a range of innovations, ranging from the development of household robotics such as Rod Brooks' iRobot vacuum cleaner through to computer games that use evolutionary artificial intelligence approaches, to the special effects in Hollywood blockbusters. The battle scenes in the film Troy, for example, were produced with software developed by Torsten Reil's Natural Motion company, which in turn was based on principles spun out of the alife movement. </p> <p>Elsewhere, financial systems modelling biologically-inspired evolutionary algorithms are used to analyse complex financial portfolios by companies such as CodeFarm and Icosystem, while BT is investing in alife approaches as a means for understanding and manipulating the behaviour of large, complicated, open socio-technological systems such as wireless networks. The idea is that the BT could build telecommunications networks that could self-regulate and repair.</p> <p>\"Cells are constantly processing information. Everything that is alive is a fantastic information processor,\" says Klaus Peter Zauner of the University of Southampton. Just as 19th-century engineers studied the flight of birds and dreamed of being airborne, he says, so today's computer engineers marvel at the intelligence in all forms of life and contemplate the potential of more efficient computation.</p> <p><strong>Great leaps forward</strong></p> <p>There are, however, major conceptual challenges that need to be overcome before the synthetic cells are possible. First, the coupling of the three essential components of a living cell: metabolism; membrane and inheritance system is not yet fully understood. \"Second, and more generally,\" says Penn, \"we need to better understand the respective roles of evolution and self-organisation and how they combine to produce living systems.\"</p> <p>A decade ago, artificial life was criticised by the evolutionary biologist John Maynard Smith as being a \"fact-free science\", but the recent leaps forward mean that it is belatedly being accepted into the scientific mainstream.</p>",
  "<p>An interesting development this year was the discovery by the IT industry of a whole new market for affordable computers of the kind that Asus makes and which has already spawned a host of imitators. But there is an even bigger market staring the industry in the face. There are now more pensioners than children under 16. However, the word \"pensioner\" is still a bit of a turnoff for the youth-centric marketing and advertising industries and so, to a lesser extent, is \"silver surfers\" or even \"older people\". But call the same people \"baby boomers\", and suddenly we change from a no-go area to a huge marketing opportunity. Baby boomers - those born after the second world war from about 1946 - are starting to retire, and they have different expectations and lifestyles to their forebears. Reared on rock'n'roll and the Spectrum or BBC computers, they are technically savvy with high spending power. Most have no intention of retiring quietly, a fact that technology companies are only just realising.</p> <p>There are, of course, far too many poor pensioners. Some 3.5 million are living alone despite a global revolution in communications technology. Pensioners spend six hours online a week on average, but nearly half of people over 50 don't have a computer, according to Age Concern. When they do have web access the results are dramatic: consumers over 65 who have a net connection spend 50% more time online per day (90 minutes) than the UK average of one hour. So the first priority must be universal broadband for all, as the European Union said last month. Next there is a psychological barrier to overcome, the deeply embedded perception that they are too old or it's \"not for me\". Recently, I watched a 70-year-old type his first query into Google and the look of utter amazement it generated was a joy to behold.</p> <p>Of course, there is no substitute for real-life meetings. But for older people reluctant or unable to go out of doors regularly, the potential of new technology is awesome - email, chatrooms, photo sites such as <a href=\"http://Flickr.com\">Flickr.com</a>, search engines, free videoconferencing through Skype, social networks, Twitter or even virtual worlds to attract kindred souls. The point is that nearly all of them are pretty easy to use, so long as the instructions are set out clearly and in reasonably large type. Websites designed for older people are starting to appear. Last week I went to the opening of <a href=\"http://thetimesofmylife.com\">thetimesofmylife.com</a>, an interesting site enabling older people (and others) to post their memories - in text, audio or video - to be shared and preserved for posterity. Its effectiveness can't really be judged until there is more material up there but a lot of thought has gone into making it simple to operate. It is well worth trying, even though it is not dissimilar from the more complicated miomi.com, aimed at all ages. Another new one aimed at older people is finerday.com, the owners of which have taken trouble to make it easy to use but have spoiled it with an entry procedure that will defeat most older people since it involves having to memorise a pattern of squares within a grid. No thanks.</p> <p>It is high time the moral of all this - honing technology to user needs - was adopted by others, not least telephone manufacturers, who fail to see the enormous market for a simple phone. Some companies are trying hard, such as Samsung (see <a href=\"http://jitterbug.com\">jitterbug.com</a>) and also the Austrian Emporia, two of whose phones I tried recently There were big buttons on the keyboard, a big monochrome screen with large letters, just four navigational buttons (plus an emergency button on the back) and also a torch. The concept was great but it was tricky to use - the keys needed quite a lot of pressure to depress and navigation wasn't intuitive. Manufacturers had better turn over a new leaf soon or the wrath of the baby boomers will know no end.</p> <p><a href=\"http://vic.keegan@theguardian.com\">vic.keegan@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Unions reacted with fury yesterday to an announcement by Hewlett-Packard that it is to sack 3,378 staff in Britain after its takeover of IT company EDS last May.</p> <p>The Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union, which represents more than 2,000 staff at EDS, warned that the delivery of computerised government services to benefit claimants, pensioners, Ministry of Defence personnel and Home Office and prison services could be hit by the big reduction in staff over the next two years. The union warned it would \"vigorously oppose\" any compulsory redundancies by HP.</p> <p>The computer firm, which had already announced it was going to sack 24,600 workers worldwide, had been expected to sack staff when it took over EDS. It is, in fact, sacking more than a fifth of the 15,000 EDS employees in Britain. This is 10% higher than the union's worst fears.</p> <p>\"This announcement creates further uncertainty with little or no detail of where the axe will fall and comes as a huge blow to the workforce in the time of economic turmoil,\" Mark Serwotka, general secretary of the PCS, said yesterday. </p> <p>\"Our concerns about government IT contracts in the Ministry of Defence and Department of Work and Pensions will not be alleviated by this announcement. </p> <p>\"It's not just jobs that are at risk, but the delivery of public services that rely on IT services provided by the former EDS. We will be pressing management for more detail and assurances on compulsory redundancies and service levels.\" </p> <p>HP last night declined to discuss exactly where the job losses will fall. EDS staff are based in 200 sites across Britain including London, Newcastle, Birmingham, Glasgow, Aberdeen, Sheffield, Exeter and Swansea. As well as having a number of high-profile Whitehall contracts, they also work for Transport for London in developing the Oyster card and redesigning computer services for Scottish and Newcastle brewery.</p> <p>Hewlett-Packard said in a statement: \"HP expects the workforce management exercise in Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) to affect approximately 9,300 employees, with roughly half of these positions replaced to create a global workforce that has the right blend of services and delivery capabilities to address the diversity of its EMEA markets and customers.\"</p> <p>In Britain it added: \"Based on local legal requirements and consultations with the HP and EDS works councils and employee representatives, HP expects that the number of positions impacted for UK is up to 3,378. Where possible we will redeploy impacted individuals.\" </p> <p>The PCS union is already fighting for thousands of civil service jobs and the losses are expected to accelerate as a result of the economic downturn when Alistair Darling, the chancellor, announces the latest figures in his pre-budget report.</p>",
  "<p>The BBC's new director of its London 2012 operation is eyeing the start line - both metaphorically and physically - with a mixture of trepidation and excitement. On a drizzly morning at the corporation's west London headquarters in White City, Roger Mosey is speaking on the very spot where the athletes of the 1908 London Games tasted triumph and disappointment. </p> <p>After overseeing the corporation's generally well received coverage of the Beijing Olympics a century later, he has swapped the job of director of BBC Sport for a new role encompassing all of the corporation's preparations for 2012.</p> <p>According to Mosey, it was only when the corporation's top brass travelled to Beijing that they truly appreciated the need for a single senior executive in charge. \"You know the Olympics are huge, but when you see it on the scale of Beijing we all immediately thought, 'This is two, or three, or four times bigger than we thought it was',\" he says. \"I remember emotionally feeling, 'This is colossal' and, though we had some pieces in place, really feeling we had to get on with it in a much more serious, big way.\" </p> <p>That means not only planning the BBC's on-air coverage and considering how it can help bring individuals and sports to prominence in the intervening four years but also coordinating all its related operations, including arts and entertainment and the technological infrastructure required. </p> <p>The BBC will also play a key role in bringing the Games to the rest of the UK, from erecting large high-definition screens across the land to using its network of local radio and television to reflect the event through a regional prism. </p> <p>\"Two things are true - they are London's Games, as a world city, but the BBC is a UK broadcaster and the appetite is from around the UK to watch and take part. The whole of the UK should fizz about it,\" says Mosey, warming to his theme. </p> <p>\"You've got this opportunity to make the whole of the UK feel like they're part of it - that sense of involvement and participation. In some cases the approval levels for the Olympics get higher the further away from London you go.\"</p> <p>Like the London organising committee chairman, Seb Coe, and others he feels that London will succeed not by trying to trump Beijing in terms of scale but by delivering a warmer, more welcoming Games. \"I loved the Beijing Games; I thought they were sensational,\" he says. \"But when you came out of your Holiday Inn up the Olympics lane to the industrial estate, sat with a load of people you worked with and then came back again, your interaction with the city wasn't particularly strong.\" Perhaps the BBC's late-night coverage could come from Trafalgar Square, he muses, and he considers how the use of Wimbledon for tennis, Lord's for archery and Horse Guards Parade for beach volleyball will provide impressive backdrops for TV coverage. </p> <p>Aided by Team GB's stellar performance, Mosey went out on a high as the Beijing Games showed how breadth of coverage via the internet and interactive television could be married with the defining moments that can unite the nation. By the end, 73% of the population had seen at least some Olympics coverage and even those who had strongly questioned the need for 437 BBC staff to make the trip had largely acquiesced.</p> <p>The relief is palpable. \"There is a point a week before the Games when you think, 'This has a really high potential to go wrong',\" he says. \"The dog that didn't bark was that no one said the BBC kowtowed on politics or got the tone wrong.\" </p> <p>The verdict on the rest of Mosey's tenure is more mixed. He secured Six Nations rugby, Wimbledon, the Olympics, the World Cup and European Championship on the BBC and brought back formula one. He also delivered in terms of developing a more integrated multimedia offering. But he faced criticism for leaving the BBC without any live football this season and for failing to bid for domestic Test cricket rights. </p> <p>He says it is up to so-called minority sports to seize the opportunity to break into the mainstream in the run-up to 2012. The BBC is committed to covering every single Olympic sport through, at the very least, its website. \"For a number of minority and participation sports, if they are ever going to make their mark in the national consciousness this is the four years in which they are going to do it,\" he says, pointing to cycling as the obvious example of one that is getting it right. \"You've got top-level, elite success and there's also the chance to participate and it's great for exercise and stuff.\" </p> <p>He adds: \"It's not always about conventional events coverage in a Grandstand style. Tom Daley became famous without any live diving being on the BBC [beforehand]. You can tell the story of sport in a number of different ways.\"</p> <p>The BBC will be crucial to the success of the Games, but the Olympics could also play a pivotal role in safeguarding the future of the BBC. In the year that Britain switches to digital television, it hopes the event will help make the case for maintaining the licence fee in the digital age. </p> <p>\"Ben Gallup [the head of BBC Sport interactive] and I both said that as the abdication was to radio and the coronation to television, so the Olympics would be to digital Britain. It's the year of analogue switch-off. We want to deliver every event live. At the moment we can only do six live streams. We want to have 20 when there are 20 events going on,\" he enthuses. </p> <p>The creation of this role for Mosey, who will oversee a \"pathfinder\" team of BBC staff based on the east London site well before any other media, also neatly sidesteps the questions raised about BBC Sport's planned move to Salford just months before the UK's biggest ever sporting event is held in the capital. </p> <p>\"You can't take a strategic decision about 30 or 40 years based on two weeks. For 2011 and 2012, BBC Sport will be operating to some degree on two sites. The key planning team will be in London,\" he says. \"But it's right the BBC should spend its money around the UK, and Salford will hopefully be a world-class centre.\" </p> <p>He insists that the BBC's role as cheerleader should not stop it from also acting as a critic. \"We have programmes that look at tough critical issues, and so they should,\" he says. \"But that shouldn't stop us being involved in trying to make it a success. I think the two things exist perfectly happily side by side.\"</p> <p>As the scale of the challenge in coordinating the disparate tribes of the corporation towards a single goal becomes clear, Mosey has no doubt that the BBC, and the Games in general, will deliver: \"The BBC, one million per cent, can deliver a great Games in 2012. What is there not to like about delivering the biggest event the BBC has ever covered in peacetime?\"</p> <h2>Mosey's record</h2> <p><strong>Plusses</strong></p> <p><strong>Motor racing</strong> A \u00a3160m four-year deal brings formula one back to the Beeb from 2009 after a 13-year absence</p> <p><strong>Tennis</strong> The BBC retains its sole right to broadcast Wimbledon, keeping tabs on Andy Murray, below, until 2014</p> <p><strong>Rugby union</strong> Aunty bags exclusive rights for the Six Nations until 2013 with a deal struck last October</p> <p><strong>Minuses</strong></p> <p><strong>Football</strong> The 2010 World Cup will be the next top-class live football on the BBC, as ITV and Setanta divvy up the FA Cup and England internationals in a \u00a3420m four-year deal in March 2007</p> <p><strong>Cricket</strong> BBC fails to bid for England games as Sky secures rights from 2010 to 2013 in a deal worth \u00a3300m, with Five screening highlights</p>",
  "<p>For once, Gordon Brown's soundbite undeniably matched the occasion yesterday. The \u00a3500bn breakfast bail-out of Britain's banking sector really was \"bold and far-reaching\" by any measure. With its announcement of the part-nationalisation of the heart of the country's financial system, the government delivered the funeral rites on the corpse of high Thatcherism - strangled to death by the very monsters it brought forth from the deep in the reckless frenzy of Big Bang deregulation more than two decades ago.</p> <p>Both the scale and the speed of the intervention were an object lesson in the power of government to shape and change the rules of the economic game. After a generation during which any suggestion of interference in the magic garden of City finance has been treated as destructive heresy, the rescue plan is a telling demonstration of the vast potential of public action - as well as that, in the words of the celebrated former British industrialist Arnold Weinstock, \"there is no such thing as a free market\".</p> <p>By taking a major public stake in the most strategically decisive sector of the economy, the government has finally broken the spell of private prerogative and the primacy of the market realm. Unlike the already-failing US Paulson plan, this rescue is based on the principle of cash for public equity. For all its weaknesses, the new package has brought the need for greater democratic control of economic life into sharp relief, as the catastrophic cost of the private sector's stewardship of finance for the rest of the economy makes the case for the social ownership of the banking system more powerfully every day.</p> <p>But the chorus of approval from the very people who have brought the banking system to the edge of collapse - along with the CBI and the Conservative party, which enthusiastically promoted its disastrous deregulation in the first place - should be a warning. Despite the \u00a350bn worth of minority ownership stakes Brown and Alistair Darling are planning to take in the country's biggest banks, these are non-voting preference shares with no formal say in the running of the institutions or the appointment of their managements.</p> <p>Yes, there are to be negotiations over principles of boardroom pay and new credit support for small businesses and home ownership. But, just as they took every step possible to head off the necessary nationalisation of Northern Rock earlier this year, ministers react with horror at the very thought of direct control of the banks the government will now be part-owning. While the TUC yesterday called for \"fat cats to be put on a strict diet\" and the surreally left-posturing Tory shadow chancellor George Osborne pressed in the House of Commons yesterday afternoon for a ban on bonuses in the newly bailed-out banks, Brown and the one-time Trotskyist Darling were having none of it.</p> <p>Real life seems likely to shift them both on executive pay - at a time when a good number of bankers doubtless count themselves lucky not to be facing jail terms - and the size of the public stakes, just as it has pushed the government this week to take action that would have seemed impossible only a few months ago. But there have to be the most serious doubts whether even yesterday's huge intervention will, like Paulson's, in practice match the scale of the crisis - or instead end up bailing out shareholders and the City elite that brought us to this pass, at the cost of billions of pounds of public money.</p> <p>The other two legs of the package - pumping hundreds of millions into the money markets in short-term loans and guarantees - ought to keep lending from freezing up altogether in the short term. But the experience of such repeated transfusions by central banks across the world over the past year should have driven home the point that the core of the crisis is one of solvency rather than liquidity. In other words, banks aren't lending to other banks because they (and the stock market) are convinced those outfits are sinking beneath a sea of bad debts - as in the case of the Royal Bank of Scotland, whose share price has fallen more than 80% since December.</p> <p>The government's planned recapitalisation will be injecting cash into the riskiest institutions and the danger is that shareholders will gratefully seize the opportunity to jump ship before their banks go under at huge public expense. Even without such crashes, the public debt pressures from yesterday's package are going to be heavy. Better surely to guarantee deposits and take over such banks once they've effectively failed, as in the case of Northern Rock and Bradford &amp; Bingley, securely recapitalising them as fully publicly owned enterprises.</p> <p>They could then become the core of a newly accountable and publicly controlled banking sector able to channel investment where it's needed, rather than into reckless speculation in debt and housing bubbles. What seems certain is that government intervention is going to have to become bolder still, as the crisis unfolds both in the financial markets and the real economy. Even if yesterday's package eases the domestic credit squeeze in the short term, all the signs suggest we are heading into something that goes well beyond a normal business cycle downturn, as the IMF's warnings of the most serious global crisis for 70 years underline. The threat is now of depression, not simply recession.</p> <p>Only a concerted government-driven expansion - including both a major public works programme and a much sharper cut in interest rates than the Bank of England managed yesterday - can seriously offset that, at both the national and global level. That means a programme of public housebuilding, home insulation and transport investment, along with intervention to control gas and electricity costs and action to turn repossessions into social renting. Of course that will increase public borrowing, but then so will the lengthening dole queues and multiplying business failures if Brown and his ministers decide the safer option is to tinker instead.</p> <p>By the scale and sweep of its intervention yesterday, the government has shown how much can be done and what resources can be mobilised when the stability of the system is at stake. The genie is out of the bottle - and the demand will now inevitably be for the same urgency and decisiveness on jobs, industry and housing as the crisis moves from the City to the high street.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:s.milne@theguardian.com\">s.milne@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown's attempt to rescue British banks is risky, flawed and eye-wateringly expensive. But by throwing a lifeline he has done the right thing. However galling it is to bail out an industry that has behaved appallingly and made handsome profits while doing so, banks are the lungs of the economy, taking in deposits and pumping out loans around the system. The entire industry faces destruction. The government's response to this is far better than the one made by the Bush administration. It is big (larger than the Bush plan relative to the size of the UK economy) and comprehensive. It admits that big banks are short of capital, as well as ready money, and offers them cash in return for taxpayers taking an equity stake. Mr Brown often boasts of his unrivalled economic expertise; yesterday he put it to practical use.</p> <p>Will it work? After a month in which bankers and policymakers have been wrong-footed time and again, it is worth lowering expectations. Yesterday's slide in shares showed that the markets remain gloomy. Whatever happens, we are not going back to the borrowing binge of 2006 - indeed we must not. The test of Mr Brown's scheme is not whether it can bring forth a flood of cheap money, but whether it can head off an all-out credit drought. Even in accomplishing that, there are big obstacles. One lies in Threadneedle Street. The Bank of England's surprise half-point cut yesterday was essential - and made more effective because it was coordinated with other central banks around the world. But the Bank has so far been complacent throughout the crisis. Unless it follows yesterday's move with further cuts, the attempt to jump-start private sector lending will flop. Another danger is that the international coordination achieved yesterday will not be maintained. Confidence will not return to what are, after all, global money markets without sustained globally concerted action. In particular, Europe needs to come up with a joint plan. If it fails to, the very notion of a European economic project will be hollowed out - and the single-currency zone will be pulled apart as each member fends for itself.</p> <p>Mr Brown's plan also suffers from flaws of its own. First, before launching the lifeboat, it would have been better if officials could have decided which financial institutions were worth saving. Panicked they may have been, but financial markets over the past few days have sent a clear message: some banks are safer bets than others. Unviable lenders should be wound up, not propped up, but the bail-out will not achieve this. Second, there is still no plan for what to do with the unsellable distressed assets held by the banks. Officials around the world must establish an exchange to get these securities traded again. The alternative is that the intravenous drip linking central banks to other financial institutions remains in place indefinitely. </p> <p>Yesterday's scheme is no short-term fix. It will take months to put into effect, and possibly even longer to judge its success. It is a shame, then, that the government has not given an idea of what it wants to rescue the banks for. The provision of finance is a utility, just like the distribution of water and energy. Yet this public good is in the hands of private sector managers - who have done a disastrous job. So where are ministers' ideas to reform, rather than merely fix, finance? All public investment should surely allow the pursuit of the public good - for example by requiring the banks to finance green technologies and affordable housing, to minimise repossessions and to accept new curbs on telephone-number bonuses. Yesterday's strangest sight was David Cameron calling for a clampdown on bankers' pay - while a Labour prime minister ducked giving a proper reply. Such diffidence is not only unnecessary, it may be unsustainable. Taxpayers now have a stake in the UK's banks; they must have a say in who runs them and how they do business. Otherwise, the plan will do no more than flush billions away, to be followed by billions more.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Pinto bean, black bean and chorizo soup</strong></p> <p>When we first opened Leon we did so with a swathe of Brazilians, who were a lot of fun to work with, and used to proudly bring in bits of their national cuisine for us to try.

  "<p>Is it a \u00a350bn or a \u00a3500bn rescue package? It makes no difference. All the chips will be committed if necessary. The sums made available to the banks under the special liquidity regime will be \"at least\" \u00a3200bn. In terms of capital being injected into banks, the back-stop facility of \u00a325bn is \"an incremental minimum\". The extent to which banks take up \u00a3250bn of funding guarantees will be kept \"under review\". In other words, these very large numbers could yet grow.</p> <p>So thank goodness the scheme is well-designed. It addresses banks' three big problems - capital, liquidity and funding. In that regard, it is better than Hank Paulson's $700bn bail-out plan in the US, which offered only to tow away some toxic assets at undetermined prices. The UK version leaves these assets on the banks' balance sheets but should make the institutions more able to manage their pain. If the capital cushions prove inadequate, the cushions will be stuffed with yet more capital. The plan is bold, risky and carries no guarantee of success, but there is no alternative. </p> <p>On Tuesday afternoon, with the share prices of Royal Bank of Scotland and HBOS falling 40%, there was the possibility of a run on the entire UK banking system.</p> <p>Thank goodness, too, that the Bank of England sees the need to cut interest rates - or has been told to see the need. Few bank recapitalisations ever work without lower rates. </p> <p>In the jargon, it's a question of steepening the yield curve - lowering the cost of short-term money to give banks an incentive to lend at higher rates over longer periods. The US has refloated its banking system this way more than once. The technique cheats the taxpayer, because the full benefits of lower rates are not passed on, but, at the moment, the priorities are financial stability and avoiding a deep recession. Inflation is yesterday's problem.</p> <p>So what is there to quibble about? Plenty. Why, for example, is Sir Fred Goodwin, chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland, still in a job? RBS is the author of its own misfortune to a great degree. Sir Fred pursued the top-of-the-market acquisition of ABN Amro last year even when the credit crisis had started to unfold. RBS has notably failed to take self-help measures: we're still waiting for the bank to sell the bulk of its insurance assets, as it pledged. Is the taxpayer now expected to support RBS with the same captain at the helm?</p> <p>There was nothing in yesterday's statement to suggest otherwise. There was a line about how the government would \"take into account dividend policies and executive compensation practices\" as a condition of committing capital. That's woolly. If the taxpayer is claiming the right to influence pay practices, surely there is a right also to influence who is paid. In the US, senior heads have rolled when financial institutions have been bailed-out; in Britain, we're still waiting.</p> <p>The poor taxpayer will also wonder why the most important figure was missing from yesterday's release - how much will the banks be paying for their capital? What level of dividend will be paid on preference shares? By rights, the yield should be above 10%, and maybe as much as 12% in some cases. Until we see the figures, it is hard to judge whether the taxpayer is getting a fair deal, and to what degree we will share the spoils if the plan works.</p> <p>And how do you measure a commitment to support lending to small businesses and home-buyers? That is the other ambition of the scheme, but the government is relying on the bankers to play ball. </p> <p>Barclays last month picked up the carcass of Lehman Brothers' operations in New York. Maybe it got a bargain that will strengthen the bank to everybody's advantage. </p> <p>But will such overseas adventures be allowed when there is a crisis on the home front? If not, how could they be prevented? The government is not asking for a seat on the board of any bank.</p> <p>That lack of detail illustrates how the scheme was put together in a hurry. The official version of events is that the plans have been worked on for three weeks. Maybe, but Alistair Darling was clearly rushed into an announcement by events in the market. </p> <p>The market's mood hardly improved yesterday, but little should be read in that. The fires in the global financial system continue to burn and the belated arrival of Darling's fire engine doesn't tell us how much damage will eventually be done. At least there is now a broad plan, but let's have the details sharpish, please.</p>",
  "<h2>US company snaps up MessageLabs for \u00a3400m</h2> <p>US-based Symantec yesterday snapped up email security specialist MessageLabs for $695m (\u00a3398m) in a deal that will see the Gloucester company's founders and management share \u00a3200m. MessageLabs was founded in 1999 by Ben White and his brother Jos, along with Rory Sweet. Now non-executive directors, they own about half the business together with its executive team, which includes chief executive Adrian Chamberlain. MessageLabs, which has 500 staff and secures the communications of some 8 million users, saw revenue rise to $145m in the year to the end of July. <br><strong>Richard Wray</strong></p> <h2>Annual profits sag 87% at Land of Leather</h2> <p>The credit crunch and collapsing housing market have all but wiped out profits at Land of Leather, forcing the furniture retailer's six-person board to defer their salaries. The company, which in July had to raise \u00a313.5m in a rights issue backed by the Icelandic bank Kaupthing, saw profits for the year to August 3 plunge from \u00a318.5m to \u00a32.3m. The company is trying to conserve cash after yesterday predicting the market will remain challenging into 2009. From April to the end of July it slashed its advertising budget - which is mostly spent on TV spots - by more than a third and cut jobs. <br><strong>Richard Wray</strong></p> <h2>Poor appetite for M&amp;S sandwiches hurts Uniq</h2> <p>A big drop in sandwich sales at Marks &amp; Spencer has rebounded on the food maker Uniq, which issued a profit warning yesterday. Shares plunged 42% to 44.5p as analysts revised forecasts from a full-year profit of \u00a33m to a loss of about \u00a32.5m. Uniq is in the middle of a restructuring project, cutting 400 jobs and closing a factory at Paignton in Devon. It saw sandwich sales slow from a first-half growth of 13.1% to 2.1% in the third quarter. Uniq is being squeezed by higher food and energy costs and is also hit by supermarkets cutting their overheads by winning better deals from suppliers. <br><strong>Terry Macalister</strong></p> <h2>Blow for account holders in bank charges ruling</h2> <p>Consumers have lost the latest round of the legal battle to force high street banks to refund overdraft charges. The high court decided yesterday charges levied in the six years to January 2008 were not \"penalties\", reflecting an earlier decision on current terms and conditions. But the courts have to decide whether overdraft charges are \"fair\" under the unfair terms in consumer contracts regulations - an anti-bank decision would benefit current account holders. The case was brought by the Office of Fair Trading, seeking \"clarity\" after lower courts ordered some banks to refund charges. <br><strong>Tony Levene</strong></p> <h2>Volvo Cars cuts deeper to lay off 3,300 workers</h2> <p>Volvo Cars said yesterday it was planning to cut some 3,300 jobs as it battles the downturn in the global market. The contracts of about 700 consultants will also be ended. The bulk of the latest round of job cuts will be in Sweden but the company said another 600 would go at its operations elsewhere. Volvo had announced it was cutting more than 2,000 jobs but yesterday it said further cost savings were needed. Several European carmakers have revealed plans to curb production as demand falls. Last month registrations in the UK, for example, fell by more than a fifth.<br><strong>Mark Milner</strong></p>",
  "<p>He is the biggest-selling writer in English you've never heard of. His name doesn't grace any Booker list, but it is found on the lips of every college student in India. While the global literati dwell on the fiction of India's past, Chetan Bhagat has become India's favourite writer by embracing the present.</p> <p>At 35, Bhagat's chronicling of the trials and tribulations of the country's middle-class youth has made him a publishing phenomenon in India. His first two novels have sold more than a million copies, dwarfing those of writers in English labelled best-selling.</p> <p>His latest novel, a bittersweet small town comedy set amid a trio of Indian obsessions - cricket, religion and business - sells a copy every 17 seconds. His work will reach parts of India others can only dream of when the Bollywood film Hello, adapted from his book One Night @ the Call Centre, opens on Friday.</p> <p>Bhagat covets mass appeal. His books are priced at 95 rupees (\u00a31.20) - the same as a cinema ticket. The author says his work is a mass market product in a country with no tradition of English-language pulp fiction. </p> <p>His last book was launched in supermarkets. \"We don't have bookshops in every town. We have supermarkets. I want my books next to jeans and bread. I want my country to read me,\" he said.</p> <p>Bhagat's formula is simple: write in the quirky, quick-fire campus English that young Indians use and focus on the absurdities of how to get ahead in contemporary India. \"What is the purpose of literature? It is to raise a mirror to society. What is the point of writers who call themselves Indian authors but who have no Indian readers?\" he said.</p> <p>Such brash populism has drawn barbs from the literary world. Many critics say his books have no lasting value. He is condemned for not using \"proper\" English and writing novels fit only for \"toilet reading\". </p> <p>But Bhagat is unperturbed. \"It's just the old establishment in India that controls too much of the media. They do not ask what my sales say about a generation of young people in India.\"</p> <p>With a booming Indian economy and loosening social mores, Bhagat's first novel, Five Point Someone, was published in 2004 at an opportune moment. Young people had begun to have far more options than their parents but their choices remain circumscribed by a traditional education system and overbearingly high expectations.</p> <p>Five Point Someone is a story of the exam-overloaded lives of students who get into the country's top university, the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, only to rebel against the stultifying atmosphere of academic competition. It features drinking games, soft drug use and an affair between a student and his professor's daughter. </p> <p>Bhagat, himself a graduate of the university, says the book's breezy manner should not undermine its message: that India's overachiever ethic smothers creativity in the pursuit of passing exams. \"[In India] people are just mugging up and puking out whatever they study. It's not a proper education.\"</p> <p>One Night @ the Call Centre, his second novel, is a romantic comedy set in an office where bored young Indians sit behind terminals helping to resolve inane queries from technologically challenged Americans. </p> <p>Bhagat said he got most of the best lines from friends and relatives working in call centres. \"In the book a trainer says that the brain and IQ of a 35-year-old American is the same as the brain of a 10-year-old Indian. That happened to a friend of mine.\"</p> <p>Bhagat's own story is a reflection of the hunger that drives this young India. By his mid-20s he had become the embodiment of the Indian dream: an investment banker in Hong Kong. Disillusionment set in after his firm went bust in the 1998 Asian financial crisis just as his parents divorced and Bhagat's father refused to accept his son's decision to marry a woman from a different part of India. \"I have not really spoken to [my father] since.\"</p> <p>For Bhagat the generational divide is the one India desperately needs to bridge. He said the older generation grew up in a time of scarcity and prized a suffocating social conformity where everyone lived separate but equal lives. The young are almost a race apart with a liberal attitude that is inimical to the Indian hierarchies of caste and creed. </p> <p>Bhagat's model society is China, not because of its economic success but because of its social upheaval. \"India needs a cultural revolution to change mindsets. In China it was bloody but India needs to learn the old ways are not always the best ways.\"</p> <p>Bhagat still works for an investment bank. He said he could not give up the day job because his lifestyle required three incomes: his own, his wife's and that from his writing. </p> <p>\"I have twin boys. My six-figure dollar cheque from Bollywood is not enough to pay a year's rent on my [Mumbai] penthouse.\"</p> <h2>Extract</h2> <p>From the corner of my eye I tried to see her. She was young, maybe early to mid-twenties. Her waist-length hair had a life of its own, a strand falling on her forehead repeatedly. I could not see her face closely, but I could tell one thing - she was pretty. And her eyes - once you looked into them, you could not turn away. I kept my gaze down. She rearranged stuff in her handbag. I tried to look out of the window. It was completely dark. \"So, pretty empty train,\" she said after 10 minutes. </p> <p>\"Yes,\" I said. \"It is the new holiday special. They just started it, without telling people about it.\"</p> <p>\"No wonder. Otherwise, trains are always full at this time.\"</p> <p>\"It will get full. Don't worry. Just give it a few days,\" I said and leaned forward. \"Hi. I am Chetan, by the way, Chetan Bhagat.\"</p> <p>\"Hi,\" she said and looked at me for a few seconds. \"Chetan as in ... I don't know, your name sounds familiar.\"</p> <p>Now this was cool. It meant she had heard of my first book. I am recognised rarely. And of course, it had never happened with a girl on a night train.<br>\u2022 From One Night @ the Call Centre</p>",

  "<p>The struggling insurance company AIG was given a fresh loan of $37.8bn by the Federal Reserve last night, on top of last month's $85bn emergency credit line, as it struggled to rebuild financial stability. The move capped a gloomy day on Wall Street which ended with another plunge in stocks after the US treasury secretary, Henry Paulson, warned that financial \"turmoil\" will not end soon and that more banks are likely to bite the dust.</p> <p>AIG came under fire from the presidential candidate Barack Obama on Tuesday, who said that executives should be sacked for spending $440,000 on a corporate getaway at a Californian resort last month. AIG's chief executive, Edward Liddy, yesterday defended the get-together, saying that 90 of the 100 people there were independent insurance agents. But he said AIG was \"re-evaluating\" its outgoings \"in the light of the new circumstances in which we are all operating\".</p> <p>Wild swings on the markets continue to unnerve traders, who said yesterday's half-point cut in interest rates had come as little surprise. A temporary ban on \"short\" selling in financial stocks ends today in the US, posing the possibility of fresh volatility.</p> <p>Cuts in interest rates around the world failed to provide lasting cheer as the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 189 points to 9,258.

  "<p>The bitterest irony is that, as the global financial system teeters on the brink, trade union barons met at the board of Tribune (sales 4,000) on Tuesday to prepare for an orderly rundown of the magazine that has been a thorn in capitalism's side for over 70 years. Printers and other debts will be paid, leaving Chris McLaughlin, the editor, to hunt for a new sponsor now that the big five unions feel they have spent enough. What sort of backer? Labour supporters with money seems to be the general idea - the kind of people who set up the magazine in the 1930s. Three expressions of interest so far and none were Icelandic. Fingers crossed.</p> <p>\u2022 One side-effect of the crisis is more focus on the European Union. If it finds it so hard to act decisively when the outlook is so bleak, what - critics say - is the point of the entire thing. We, however, believe the concept has been invaluable not least because it has allowed Ukip and its outriders to shape how we are viewed within the EU institutions. Two examples reach us: one concerning culture, the other crime. The first concerns Tom Wise, who was elected a Ukipian but now sits as an independent. Currently he is on police bail for an alleged fraud. He was implored by V\u00e9ronique De Keyser, a Belgian MEP, to view a film, the work of her constituents, and one of three movies shortlisted for the Lux Prize for cinema. To take his mind off things, perhaps, he went along. According to the email he sent later, this was a mistake. \"Colleagues, I wasted 105 minutes of my life watching impenetrable gibberish; the foetid ramblings of a perverted mind. What a total waste of time, money, resources, hope and ambition,\" he told them, before adding: \"PS, it will probably win as it sums up the whole EU project.\" That said, he is still there. Don't torture yourself, Tom. Come home.</p> <p>\u2022 But this is frippery. Crime is serious. Dirk Sterckx, another Belgian, asks: \"What can the European Union do to protect seafarers and trade?\" Gerald Batten, a Ukip founder and MEP for London, answers: \"Do what the Royal Navy used to do - hunt them down and hang them.\" And bring back the king's shilling.</p> <p>\u2022 There's much to admire and a few things to be worried about when considering the government's new Young Muslim Advisory Group. It was launched at the Foreign Office on Tuesday. Jacqui Smith, David Miliband and Hazel Blears were there. The right notes were struck, but when things become tense and the nuances begin to matter, it will be essential to ensure that the right people are in charge of all the preparations. Melton Mowbray may be lovely but it is known the world over for its pork pies; so whoever decided to ferry the young Muslims there for the group's first away day took a bit of a risk, culturally speaking. The issue is fraught enough as it is.</p> <p>\u2022 Finally, news of Atma Singh, Ken Livingstone's former adviser, whose accounts of extremism and chicanery within London's City Hall were seized upon by those who fought to remove the former Labour mayor of London so he could be replaced by the lovable incumbent Tory. Atma's accounts of Trotskyite plotting and electoral rule-bending marked him out as someone who would one day rise to prominence. Now he tells us how. Under the heading \"Atma Singh, contender for mayor of London in 2012\", he writes to Boris Johnson, copying in the Confederation of British Industry and Alistair Darling, calling for the blond one to convene an urgent business summit. \"This is not a personal issue. I like your personality as mayor of London,\" he tells the mayor. But \"while I will give you the benefit of the doubt during the transition period, I will speak out on issues when I have a difference (on philosophy and policy), specific criticism or specific demand in my robust style.\" He has, he writes: \"The right to say these things. I am a London resident, council taxpayer, a UK citizen, mayor of London contender 2012 and a human being born free with dignity.\" He may be many other things besides, but Boris had better listen. Look what he did to Ken.</p>",
  "<p>Rufus Wainwright's plangent, melancholic pop songs, pulsating with emotion and drama, might be said to have an operatic perfume about them. And now the singer-songwriter is going the whole way - composing a two-act, two-hour opera for four singers and full orchestra, to be premiered in Manchester next year.</p> <p>\"I was horrified, petrified,\" he said of plunging into opera-writing. \"But now I've jumped in, it's an utter joy.\"</p> <p>The opera has been commissioned by Manchester international festival (MIF), following on from its successful premiere last year of Damon Albarn's Monkey: Journey to the West.</p> <p>\"Since I was 14 years old I have been converted to the dark religion of opera,\" said Wainwright. \"I'll even be dramatic about it: it has saved my life, guiding me through some pretty tough junctures.\" </p> <p>For years, he said, he had been looking for an operatic subject \"that wasn't a saga involving a chorus and insane costumes\". Finally, \"a story fell into my lap, after watching an interview with Maria Callas. The opera is not about her, but it is about the persona of an opera star; it is the day in the life of an opera singer. Opera is one of the last bastions where you can investigate big emotions and romanticism; and opera singers themselves are tied into that sensibility because they inhabit that universe.\" </p> <p>The piece is to be called Prima Donna, and he described the story as \"late Straussian\" - \"the subtle shifts of a woman's heart; the grave consequences of little actions\".</p> <p>Wainwright, who grew up in Quebec, said that the lyrics had naturally come to him in French: \"The French language flows a lot better in that kind of music; and in fact in turn the language has given rise to melodies that sound very French,\" he said, adding that he was \"blown away\" by writing for operatic voices, which he called \"incredible instruments\".</p> <p>The musical language will not, he said, be modernist, \"but extremely romantic and melodious\". He added: \"I want to capture an audience through beautiful music. I want it to be pertinent and challenging - but it is not Wozzeck or Ewartung,\" referring to two of the great expressionist masterpieces of the early 20th century, by Berg and Schoenberg respectively.</p> <p>Wainwright is working with two assistants, students from Yale, but he says that he intends to orchestrate the work himself. The work is almost complete in outline: he is near to finishing a vocal score with piano reduction; the first act is already orchestrated; and MIF expects delivery of a full score in February. The piece is being workshopped this week with other members of the creative team.</p> <p>The work is to be produced in partnership with Opera North, whose orchestra will perform the work under Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Valade. Daniel Kramer, responsible for English National Opera's recent production of Birtwistle's Punch and Judy, will direct, and Janis Kelly will take the lead role in the four-strong cast alongside Rebecca Bottone, William Joyner and Jonathan Summers.</p> <p>Wainwright listed his operatic enthusiasms: \"I am a Traviata fan; and I love the Ring cycle. I'm also a big Massenet fan. It is the romantic works that nourish me. I owe my musical outlook to Verdi - he gives me the full spectrum of a perfect career. Each of his operas was incrementally better than the last; but even the early works combined musical depth with so much simplicity. Verdi is my main man.\" </p> <p>The opera was originally to be co-commissioned by the Metropolitan Opera, New York, but Wainwright and the Met's general manager, Peter Gelb, parted company after it became clear that Gelb wanted an opera in English. Wainwright, however, was unwilling to switch languages; and he was also concerned by the Met's long lead times, meaning his opera would probably have to wait several years to be staged.</p> <p>Alex Poots, artistic director of Manchester international festival, said: \"It is a risk. Monkey could have fallen apart in a spectacular way - it brought a lot of people new to the art form together. Rufus's opera is also a new venture, and in a festival of 20 world premieres there are going to be some that work better than others.\"</p> <p>He unveiled plans for two of the other major projects of next July's festival - a specially created space for the performance of Bach's solo instrumental works designed by Zaha Hadid; and an interactive theatre piece devised by Neil Bartlett on the subject of bingo, with cash prizes for audience members.</p> <p>Poots, tired of hearing great musicians from the back of cavernous concert halls, has asked Hadid to come up with the best possible environment in which to experience the intimate and complex beauty of Bach's sonatas and partitas. </p> <p>Working with an acoustician, she will create a \"room within a room\" on the top floor of the Manchester Art Gallery, which Poots expects to be \"organic and sumptuous\" in feel. The environment will seat a maximum of 200 for recitals by pianist Piotr Anderszewski, cellist Jean-Guihen Queyras and violinist Alina Ibragimova.</p> <p>Bartlett will create Everyone Loves a Winner, a work \"about a well-loved but overlooked pastime - bingo\". The Royal Exchange Theatre will be transformed into a bingo hall, the audience will play for cash prizes, and an \"emotional, tender story\" will unfold.</p> <p>The budget for last year's festival was \u00a39m, \u00a33.6m of which was raised from the private sector - an area that could suffer if the banking crisis deepens and recession kicks in. \"I am not yet worried,\" said Poots - \"but of course things are changing every day.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Manchester international festival, sponsored by the Guardian, runs from July 2 to July 19 2009.</p>",
  "<p>Steve Houghton holds up a saline drip bag tentatively between his thumb and forefinger. A smile spreads across his face. \"This is exactly the sort of thing we're looking for,\" he says, pointing to the long identification code printed across the bottom of the bag. \"This is from a Spanish boat, by the looks of it. It was probably just tossed overboard. With this code, we can now establish exactly who was responsible.\"</p> <p>Playing detective on a Cornish beach on a bright autumn morning is a welcome distraction from the task at hand. I have joined around 30 volunteers for the annual beach-cleaning event at Praa Sands, just a few miles east of Penzance. Most of us are testing the pliability of our lower backs by bending over to pick shards of plastic and other detritus off the sand and from between the rocks. More than 400 similar events take place annually at beaches all around the UK at the end of September and this national army of litter pickers, each armed with little more than a pair of garden gloves and a rubbish bag, are not only helping to keep beaches clean but also collecting crucial data about the types and volumes of waste that wash up on our shores.</p> <p>The Marine Conservation Society's Beachwatch scheme has been running since 1993 and is part of the International Coastal Cleanup, a network of similar beach-cleaning initiatives across more than 70 countries. </p> <p>The MCS's work is supported by the Crown Estate, which owns more than half of the foreshore around Britain. Last year, about 4,000 volunteers in the UK took part on 354 beaches. Across the combined extent of these beaches - 168.5km (100 miles) in total - the volunteers filled 2,771 bags with 346,054 items of litter. This sounds like a decent haul, but it is a drop in the ocean. This represents just 1.3% of the UK coastline and is merely one weekend's worth of litter picking.</p> <p>The MCS accepts that this is a largely symbolic act of cleaning to raise awareness about the sorry state of our seas. Much more important, it says, is the information it collects. For example, it has discovered that plastic is by far the most common type of waste on our beaches - almost 60% of all litter found - and its volume has more than doubled since 1993. This chimes with international research: the United Nations Environment Programme said in 2006 that every square mile of ocean on the planet contains, on average, 46,000 pieces of plastic litter. And that is not including the microscopic grains of plastic that are now fast entering the food chain as a wide variety of sea life inadvertently consumes them as they feed.</p> <p>I have paired up with Jean, who lives just a mile up the lane from the beach and who comes down every year to help out with the clean-up. As I scrabble around on the ground in the hunt for more litter, she stands behind me with a large rubbish bag and clipboard, counting and marking down all the pieces I find. Within half an hour we have gathered a wide assortment of everyday items, ranging from disposable lighters and inner soles to knotted fishing lines and cigarette butts. </p> <p>But what takes our breath away is the amount of polystyrene. Jean struggles to keep up on her clipboard. She has to tot up every tiny bit that I find and she is soon counting into the hundreds.</p> <p>\"Polystyrene is so light and buoyant that we tend to find huge amounts of it on the strandline,\" says Houghton, pointing to the thick band of seaweed and flotsam that marks the point where the highest tides reach. \"It also breaks up easily so is a nightmare to clean up.\"</p> <p>Houghton, a navy diver by trade, says he has seen an extraordinary increase in rubbish in the seas in the 30 years that he has been diving off the Cornish coast. This rise has corresponded with a sharp decline in marine life and led him to organise the annual clean-up at Praa Sands nine years ago. Since then, the volunteers have collected 23,000 items of litter from this one beach. (The local authority also cleans the mile-long beach, but it tends to concentrate on the westerly end, where the tourists gather in the summer.) \"The sea life has plummeted here,\" says Houghton. \"Spiders, crabs, lobsters, sea urchins - they've all dropped. Most people don't see it, of course, but the amount of rubbish sitting on the bottom of the sea is incredible. Most of us just see what washes up on the beaches. What we do here is largely about education. We also want to find things we can trace back to the culprits who tossed it in the sea in the first place.\"</p> <p>A third of the rubbish found on our beaches, says Houghton, can be traced to fishing and shipping. Another third can be attributed to people using the beach. The rest is classified as \"miscellaneous\", but includes \"SRDs\" (sewage-related debris). One of Houghton's best finds in recent years was a plastic casing for some sort of marine equipment marked \"Mercury - Highly Toxic to Marine Environment\". He found the company that produced it - Sperry Marine in Cardiff - and it was so shocked that it sent down a representative to Cornwall to tell off the commercial fisherman who had bought it and who had evidently thrown it overboard rather than pay for its disposal onshore.</p> <p>Houghton even views messages in a bottle in a dim light: \"I found one on this beach a few years back that had a note in it saying it was from someone in the Azores. I wrote back saying did they want to come and pick it up and also help out cleaning the rest of the litter off the beach, too.\"</p> <p>The cupped shape of this most southerly tip of the UK acts like a giant net for rubbish washing in from the Atlantic, some of which has travelled many thousands of miles (plastic lightsticks used by fishermen on the Grand Banks off Newfoundland are regularly found on Cornish beaches). The large arc of beaches that sweep around from Mounts Bay to the west to Lizard Point to the east catches volumes of rubbish well above the national average. In fact, the south-west's beaches receive twice the volume of litter compared with, say, beaches in the north-east. \"There are some beaches in this area that face in just the right direction to catch the winds, currents and tides,\" says Houghton. \"For example, at Fishing Cove at Gunwalloe, it can be knee-deep in rubbish in places at times.\"</p> <p>After two hours of clearing up, we reward ourselves with tea and biscuits before gathering around the rubbish bags to inspect our haul. Eight black bags containing 63kg (10 stone) of rubbish stand before us. Looking down the extent of the beach we have covered, the sand looks noticeably cleaner.

  "<p>Businesses and consumers across the world must brace themselves for tough times, as the yearlong financial crisis tips almost all big economies into recession, the International Monetary Fund said yesterday.</p> <p>Olivier Blanchard, the IMF's economic counsellor, welcomed the coordinated cuts in interest rates from six central banks, including the Bank of England, and taxpayer-backed bailouts of struggling banks. </p> <p>\"It is clear that there will be tough economic times ahead,\" Blanchard said as he unveiled the IMF's half-yearly health check of the global economy in Washington. He said that financial markets were in the grip of \"a downward spiral of loss of confidence and trust,\" and government rescue plans would take time to work.</p> <p>\"The re-establishment of trust or, more formally, the decline in counterparty risk within the financial system, will take time. During that time, credit to the ultimate borrowers will be limited and expensive.\"</p> <p>The IMF's bleak warning came as Robert Zoellick, president of the World Bank, said the credit crunch had also created a \"human crisis\" in many of the poorest countries, which required a coordinated response. He said the number of malnourished people was expected to increase by 44 million this year, to 967 million, as a result of high food prices. </p> <p>Despite its pessimistic assessment, the IMF said the risk of a new Great Depression was small. It expects 9% growth in China, 7% in India, and 6% in Africa to partly offset the weakness in the west. Overall, the IMF is forecasting 3% growth in the global economy, the slowest since the downturn that followed the dotcom crash.</p> <p>Blanchard said the severity of the crisis meant that governments would be forced to adopt coherent plans in the near future. \"Under that assumption, I believe that the risk of a Great Depression is nearly nil.\"</p>",
  "<p>It is not often <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/gordonbrown\">Gordon Brown</a> goes to bed at 10 o'clock, but such was his eerie calm over the rescue package that he clocked off comparatively early on Tuesday, rising at 5am to phone Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, who has been his closest European ally during this crisis. </p> <p>By the time he turned the lights out at No 10, the PM already knew that the banks had abandoned their opposition to recapitalisation. </p> <p>In the Treasury war room overlooking St James's Park, central London, his chancellor, Alistair Darling, was thrashing out the details of the bail-out with ministers, lawyers and executives from the eight leading banks, who had no real option but to strike a deal despite anxiety about the stigma it might attach to their businesses.</p> <p>Anticipating the long and tense night ahead for him and his team, Darling had taken matters in hand at 8.30pm, personally ringing one of his favourite restaurants, Gandhi's in Kennington, south London, to order \u00a3245 worth of rice, karahi lamb, tandoori chicken, vegetable curry and aloo gobi.</p> <p>With Darling were three ministers - Paul Myners, the new City spokesman and former hedge-fund boss, Shriti Vadera, minister for economic competitiveness and small business, and Yvette Cooper, the chief secretary in the Treasury. </p> <p>Myners, a close ally of Brown, only joined the government on Friday, but he was familiar with the recapitalisation plan before his appointment, and played a crucial role ahead of Tuesday evening's summit, meeting all the banks to win assurances they would support the scheme.</p> <p>Others on the government side included Tom Scholar, a Treasury official who had had only two hours sleep since Sunday, and Nicholas Macpherson, the Treasury permanent secretary. </p> <p>The bank bosses made an unlikely group. Among them were Sir Fred Goodwin, the Glaswegian raised in a Paisley housing estate who runs Royal Bank of Scotland; Barclays boss John Varley, an archetypal City gent, with a taste for old-fashioned suits, high-waisted trousers and braces; Eric Daniels, the understated, tanned American who is chief executive of Lloyds TSB; and HBOS chief Andy Hornby, a former management consultant who, at 41, is one of the youngest bosses of Britain's leading companies. Sir Mervyn Davies was also present, in two roles: as chairman of Standard Chartered, and as a long-standing government adviser. </p> <p>HSBC, which has indicated it does not intend to turn to the government for any help, sent a relatively junior executive, raising the hackles of some of the other banking bosses. The HSBC chief executive, Mike Geoghegan, was not even in the country. The atmosphere at the meeting was tense, with the need to deliver a solution to the crisis abundantly clear to everyone present. </p> <p>In the talks, acute sensitivity was shown by the banks to the conditions that ministers wanted to attach to recapitalisation, with much haggling over the terms of access to the loan guarantee. Though he was not there personally, the prime minister was determined that, in return for such a massive taxpayer investment, it had to be seen the banks were not getting off scot free. Strings had to be attached. </p> <p>In return for taking a stake, the government argued it needed to be satisfied about each bank's policy on executive remuneration, dividend payments, supervision arrangements and a commitment to lend to homeowners and small businesses.</p> <p>Darling had studied the political backlash that greeted US Treasury package, leaving the Republicans badly exposed. Other conditions demanded of the banks were over access to the extension of the existing special liquidity scheme that provided a \u00a3250bn loan guarantee - or insurance - to encourage banks to lend to each other. This would be offered in return for a commercial fee to the government.</p> <p>Darling, though, had to reassure the banks that they were not being taken over, and that the scheme was voluntary.</p> <p>The bones of the deal were probably in place before Darling went to bed at No 11 just before 1.40am. He got up to return to the Treasury at 4.50am to sanction the final stages of the deal. Some of the banking chiefs had already drifted home.</p> <p>The prime minister was up for the final \"signing ceremony\" before dawn. </p> <p>Eventually there was a conference call when those who had left were briefed on how an era in British banking was being brought to a close. </p> <p>The agreement had been completed only two hours before a detailed statement was due to be disclosed to the markets. John Kingman, another senior treasury official, was tasked with implementing the plan, and Scholar given the job of trying to persuade other EU countries to adopt the British proposals.</p> <p>Brown, it seems, had not just been involved in shaping the deal. Behind the scenes, he has also been trying to encourage an international response, including the idea of a meeting of G7 leaders in the next fortnight.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Monday October 13 2008. The Treasury building overlooks St James's Park, not Green Park; both are in central, not west London as we said in the article above. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>With the unprecedented combination of a \u00a3500bn bail-out for Britain's banks and a coordinated interest rate cut by the world's leading central banks, there seems little in the locker if the market is still not reassured. And, so far, it has been anything but reassured. In another volatile session, the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> closed down 238.5 points at 4366.7, a fall of 5.2% and its lowest level since August 19 2004. Around \u00a357bn was wiped off the value of Britain's top companies.</p> <p>The leading index climbed as high as 4654 and fell as low as 4245, while the <strong>FTSE 250</strong> index closed 230.3 points lower at 7200.9.</p> <p>Initial euphoria after the midday announcement of the global move to knock a half-point off interest rates soon wore off, especially after an opening tumble on Wall Street. Investors were worried the measures would not be enough to avoid recession, something that was reinforced by poor figures from aluminium group Alcoa and a profit warning from insurer MetLife. By the time London closed the Dow Jones Industrial Average was around 100 points lower, while gold jumped nearly 5% as investors stuck to the theory it was a safe haven in turbulent times.</p> <p>Hopes the Bank's range of measures would help improve liquidity in money markets seemed premature, with overnight sterling Libor - the rate at which banks lend to each other - virtually unchanged and overnight dollar Libor jumping from 3.93% to 5.37%. </p> <p>Banking shares were mixed. <strong>HBOS</strong> jumped 24.5% to 117p but potential buyer <strong>Lloyds TSB</strong> lost 15.5p to 210p. <strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong> rose 0.7p to 90.7p while <strong>Barclays</strong> dropped 6.75p to 278.25p. <strong>Standard Chartered</strong>, partly due to Tuesday's overnight plunge in its key Asian markets, slid 151p to \u00a311.60.</p> <p>Miners were again in the vanguard of the selling, as metals such as copper continued to drop on worries about falling demand. <strong>Vedanta Resources</strong> dived 141p to 864p, <strong>Kazakhmys</strong> slid 48.25p to 365.25p and <strong>BHP Billiton</strong> lost 114.5p to 972.5p. Anglo-Russian group <strong>Aricom</strong> fell 13% to 14.75p as it confirmed needing $1bn in new funds to finance an iron ore project designed to supply China.</p> <p>Some housebuilders bounced after the rate cuts. <strong>Bellway</strong> added 56.75p to 540p ahead of results next week, while <strong>Persimmon</strong> rose 28p to 400.75p. <strong>Taylor Wimpey</strong> slipped 1.5p to 24p on continued concern about its banking covenants. Directories group <strong>Yell</strong>, which has sorted out its covenants, added 10.5p to 109.75p as Dresdner Kleinwort raised its target from 112p to 163p. Restaurant group<strong> Prezzo</strong> lost 8.5p to 23p as its directors abandoned a buy-out. <strong>Zenith Hygiene</strong>, which supplies toilet rolls and detergents, jumped 63% to 10p after confirming an approach that could lead to an offer at about 12p a share.</p>",
  "<p>As if there were not enough real enemies to fight, the United States has been at war with itself in recent years. They call it the culture war. It has generated more hot air than most real wars in history. John McCain has now turned to its red army tactics to rescue himself from impending defeat - and Sarah Palin is his Katyusha.</p> <p>\"There is a religious war going on in our country for the soul of America,\" declared the conservative nationalist Pat Buchanan at the Republican national convention in 1992. \"It is a cultural war, as critical to the kind of nation we will one day be as was the cold war itself.\" Later that year he explained that \"the Bosnia of the cultural war is abortion\". As Buchanan foresaw, this has been a war for power: not military power, but the kind that comes from shaping the norms, beliefs and values by which people live, and the meanings attached to words like liberalism, patriotism or, indeed, culture. The two sides in this war came to be labelled red and blue, after the colouring of Republican and Democratic states on electoral maps.</p> <p>No one has generated more hot air in this cause than Fox News anchor Bill O'Reilly, who in 2006 published a book proudly called Culture Warrior. He describes the culture war as a battle between traditionalists (\"T-Warriors\") like himself and \"the committed forces of the secular-progressive movement that want to change America dramatically: mold it in the image of western Europe\". Like Europe! God, how horrible.</p> <p>O'Reilly labels these secular-progressive forces \"S-P\", and identifies George Soros as \"El Jefe of the S-P forces\". In a fashion disturbingly familiar to any student of the 20th century, he illustrates this passage with an unflattering photo of the financier-philanthropist, captioned \"George Soros, S-P Jefe, puppet master, and moneyman\". \"Born George Schwartz to a Jewish family in Hungary in 1930,\" he explains, \"Soros assumed the identity of a gentile boy when the Nazis invaded at the start of world war II.\" This is what they call a Fox Fact. (It was Soros's father who changed the family name in 1936 and the Nazis did not invade Hungary until 1944: three errors in the space of one innuendo.) Anyway, what should that personal history have to do with an argument about cultural and social policies in 21st-century America?</p> <p>Excoriating \"leftwing outfits like the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and the British Broadcasting Company\" (Foxy Fact-checking again: it's the British Broadcasting Corporation), O'Reilly pounds the hot buttons of the culture war with a ham fist: abortion, drugs, gay marriage, not celebrating Christmas, atheism, the liberal or - as he prefers - \"S-P\" media and elites. The New York Times, he says in an afterword to the paperback edition, has \"morphed into a brochure for secular-progressive causes\". And so it goes on. And on.</p> <p>Does this matter? Over the past decade it has mattered a lot. The framing of the political debate in cultural conservative terms - a counter-revolution against the cultural revolution of 1968 - contributed significantly to George Bush's election victories in 2000 and 2004. And one way of understanding the direction taken by the McCain campaign over the past few weeks is this: only the culture war can win it for us now. On Iraq, we lose. On the economy, we lose. But by caricaturing the liberal otherness of a candidate called Barack Obama, perhaps we can snatch victory from the jaws of defeat.</p> <p>Enter Sarah Palin, the Katyusha rocket of red America. (I trust she won't mind a Russian analogy since, as she has informed us, you - or at least she - can see Russia from Alaska.) The selection of such an obviously under-qualified candidate for vice-president can only be explained by electoral calculation, and that calculation has everything to do with the politics of the country's cultural civil war. Her kind of down-home populist inveighing against Washington elites (add \"liberal\" or \"S-P\" according to taste) is part of the well-tried semantic armoury of the red army.</p> <p>Katyusha Palin now leads the attacks on Obama. This week she has repeatedly tried to tar-and-feather him by association with former terrorist William Ayers. The not-even-subliminal message is: he's not like us, he's like them. The others: elites, liberals, subversives, immigrants and infidels, closet Europeans! Chapter one of O'Reilly's Culture Warrior begins with an imagined 2020 state of the union speech by a president of the United States called Gloria Hernandez: hispanic, and a woman to boot. Worse still, she celebrates the United States as \"a diversified nation striving to be at peace with the world\". How terrifying. How blood-curdling. Give us President Palin any day.</p> <p>For Gloria Hernandez read Barack Obama. Or \"that one\", as McCain disrespectfully referred to him in Tuesday night's presidential debate. At the moment, the tactic isn't working. This election is about the economy, stupid. The pocketbook trumps the prayer book. However much McCain lauds himself as a \"maverick\", he can't disassociate himself from eight years of Republican rule that are ending in the biggest financial crisis since 1929 and a near-doubling of the national debt. And Obama is better on the economy: clearer, more specific, always bringing it back to the everyday struggles of ordinary Americans. In the instant-reaction polls, a clear majority thought Obama won that debate, as he is winning in most of the polls both nationwide and in key battleground states.</p> <p>Even if the red-clawed tactics of culture war don't pull Obama down at the last minute, an Obama victory won't spell the end of this war. But perhaps it may spell the beginning of the end. Let's be clear: this war will not finish with a victory of blue over red, or vice versa. It will finish with the accepted, peaceful coexistence in one society of different faiths, value systems and lifestyles - along the lines laid down centuries ago by the classical liberalism of John Locke and others, which so much influenced this country's Founding Fathers. It won't be \"liberals\" (in the perverted sense in which that word is now used in the United States) trouncing conservatives, but classical liberalism re-made for the 21st century. It won't be blue obliterating red, but red, white and blue - as in Obama's healing promise earlier in this campaign, that there are not red states and blue states, just the United States.</p> <p>The world needs the United States to get over its cultural civil war, and get over it fast. Not that these moral, cultural and social issues are unimportant. They are among the most important things. But they are also among the most private things. The business of government and the law should be confined to providing a liberal (in the classical sense) framework in which men and women can make personal choices about private goods. That should be only a small part of what government does. By contrast, the central business of government is to provide public goods such as national and personal security, the regulation of markets in which private enterprise can flourish, the international development that is in all our national interests, and a clean environment using diversified, sustainable energy supplies. That's what the United States needs from its new president, and that's what the world needs from the United States.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.timothygartonash.com\">www.timothygartonash.com</a></p>",
  "<p>A gloomy day on Wall Street ended with another plunge in stocks after the US treasury secretary, Henry Paulson, warned that financial \"turmoil\" will not end soon and that more banks are likely to bite the dust.</p> <p>Cuts in interest rates around the world failed to provide any lasting cheer as the fell by 189 points to 9,258. The index has fallen for six successive days, losing 14.7% of its value, amid signs of weariness and capitulation among investors.</p> <p>Leading US retail chains including Target and JC Penney produced poor trading figures, fuelling concerns of a high-street slowdown.

AIG's chief executive, Edward Liddy, yesterday defended the beach-side get-together, saying that 90 of the 100 attendees were independent insurance agents, although he said the company was \"re-evaluating\" its outgoings \"in the light of the new circumstances in which we are all operating\".</p> <p>Wild swings on the markets continue to unnerve traders who said yesterday's half-point cut in interest rates had come as little surprise.

  "<p>Last week I headed down to a press event at the 24 Club in Soho to get some hands-on time with Quantum of Solace, Treyarch's videogame tie-in with the forthcoming Bond movie. I wasn't expecting much \u2013 since GoldenEye, the 007 games been grindingly mediocre, intent on cramming in as many Bond clich\u00e9s as possible, thereby providing hopelessly confused and diluted gaming experiences. </p> <p>This one might be different. Utilising the Call of Duty 4 engine and based on elements from both Casino Royale and Quantum, we're promised something that reflects the changes to the Bond universe since the arrival of Daniel Craig. It is, apparently, going to be gritty, tough and realistic; as Executive Producer Garrett Young explains, \"We spent a lot of time talking to the filmmakers about how they think about Bond, and how they \"rebooted\" him in Casino Royale. This new Bond formed the vision for the experience we wanted to deliver in our game: Daniel Craig is a much more physical, more cunning, and more dangerous Bond than ever before.\"</p> <p>So there will be no tank driving. There certainly won't be a proliferation of ridiculous gadgets. Instead, it's a straight-up first-person shooter\u2026<br><br>\u2026.well, a straight-up first-person shooter with third-person elements. When you get close to an enemy, the camera zooms back so you can simulteneously perform and view a 'Takedown' - one quick, rugged hand-to-hand combat move that messily debilitates your target. The concept is designed to reflect Craig's highly physicalised Bond interpretation, so expect plenty of snapped necks and pulverized faces. There are also a few cinematic action sequences, which work a little like quick-time events and again, let you watch Bond carrying out the task in hand. The free-running sequence from Casino is supposed to be one example.</p> <p>The cover system is third-person, too, apparently to give you a better tactical view of the action. Like Gears of War and Rainbow Six, which also use the third-person viewpoint (the latter is a major inspiration on the Quantum team) this is a game about careful progress and positioning, not running in like a maniac brandishing a railgun. Although, with 26 weapons to collect, running in like a maniac is probably always going to be an option. On that subject, the game seems to contain the usual collection of semi-automatics, sniper rifles and machine guns. My favourite though, is the D.A.D System \u2013 an enormous multiple grenade launcher that looks like it could take out a small town, let alone a passing super criminal.</p> <p>Anyway, the action kicks off at Mr White's mansion on Lake Como where the Casino Royale movie ends. Bond has just put a bullet into White's leg when several henchmen turn up and a shoot-out commences, spilling out across the palatial gardens and down to the boathouse. There's a good sense of place and choerography, with ornamental trees and flowerbeds, providing an unlikely backdrop to the mayhem. The enemies seem reasonably intelligent, using cover, not just to duck behind stuff when you're shooting straight at them, but also to get around the environment without you seeing them. I was also told that in later levels, they'll begin to use flanking manouveres, lobbing in the odd flash grenade if you spend too long cowering behind a wall.</p> <p>I also got a quick blast on two levels inspired by Casino Royale scenes. One is in Miami and involves sniping guards from across the road before moving in to sneak around a science facility. Another is aboard a train (a sequence cut from the film), where Bond must fight his way through several carriages, blasting enemies before climbing onto the roof and leaping on to an adjacent goods vehicle. If Treyarch was hoping to avoid any GoldenEye comparisons this was probably not the level to show to journalists: it bears more than a passing resemblance to that game's own Train mission.</p> <p>Several multiplayer maps were also playable, all of which (understandably) have a real CoD4 feel to them \u2013 there's the same brutal intensity, the same sense of constant vulnerability. The environments are similar too - 'Barge', for example, is set on a large ship highly reminiscent of CoD4's Wetwork map. Another level features a rundown apartment complex, surrounded by dusty car parks and sporting a rooftop patio that's ripe for sniping. It's got the same battered, war torn look as the urban locales built by Infinity Ward. The standout for me, though, is 'Siena', a mass of rooftops, walkways and church towers, brilliantly utilising the renaissance architecture of the Tuscan city. You want to leg it around the place, jamming in and out of nooks and crannies, but one dodgy step and you're plummeting to the narrow streets below.</p> <p>As with most games these days, physics is a key concern. \"We have destructible environments, incorporating everything from ambient effects to interactions that impact gameplay,\" says Young. \"We have large 'mousetraps' gamers can use to take out multiple enemies at once (as we learned from the filmmakers, \"Bond is almost always out-manned and out-gunned\"). We even have a sinking house at the end of the Venice level, complete with swinging beams, falling elevators and paint cans that roll with the dynamic angle of the floor.\"</p> <p>So this is the new Bond, real-world physics, real-world action. No camp comedy. No safari suits. No gadgets. And apparently the movie chaps love it. As Young says, \"They really did a tremendous job of supporting us with reference and assets - we got a very early draft of the movie script, we got to visit the set four times, and we got thousands of photos and dozens of hours of video. That synergy between movie and game really comes across in how the levels look and feel\". Craig himself is a fan \u2013 contributing ideas during the development process, especially about the Bond characterization.</p> <p>Oh actually, there is one gadget. Bond can use a smart phone to patch into security cameras and hack electronic locks. He can also steal the SIMs from enemy handsets and nick all their sensitive information. But this is just peripheral stuff. It's filler, there to appease the casual crowd. The main focus is combat. It's Call of Duty with spies. I mean, how wrong could that be?</p>",
  "<p>Whales may simply have to pay the price as the Navy prepares for war, Supreme Court justices suggested today.</p> <p>In a closely watched environmental case, justices this morning repeatedly sounded sympathetic to Pentagon officials who want to run large-scale Navy exercises off the southern California coast. While the resulting underwater sonar storm disturbs marine mammals, it also helps prepare sailors for combat.</p> <p>\"I thought the whole point of the armed forces was to hurt the environment,\" justice Stephen Breyer said, half-jokingly. \"Of course they're going to do harm.\"</p> <p>The Pentagon and environmentalists disagree over exactly how much mid-frequency active sonar injures marine mammals, and justices today couldn't resolve the conflict. An apparent majority of justices, though, did appear ready to defer to military expertise in matters of national security.</p> <p>Chief justice John Roberts raised the spectre of an undetected \"North Korean diesel submarine to get [closer] to Pearl Harbor\" if sailors couldn't train with sonar, and justice Samuel Alito asked pointedly if a judge could be considered \"an expert on anti-submarine warfare\". Alito added that there is \"something incredibly odd\" about a trial judge making a decision \"contrary\" to the Navy's requirements.</p> <p>Even Breyer, who at times has been sceptical about other claims of executive authority, suggested that \"an admiral [who] comes along with an affidavit that seems plausible\" might outrank a \"district judge who just says\" the training should stop.</p> <p>\"You're asking us [for a decision], who know little about whales and less about the Navy,\" Breyer told Los Angeles-based attorney Richard Kendall, who is representing environmental groups.</p> <p>The technical but crucial legal question in Winter v Natural Resources Defense Council is when a federal agency can sidestep conventional environmental protections by declaring an emergency. A Pentagon victory could make such emergency declarations more common, and on more than just military matters.</p> <p>Even before the hour-long oral arguments today, legal scholars were predicting the conservative-led court was likely to defer to military necessity in time of war. The prediction is enhanced by the fact that Winter v Natural Resources Defense Council arises from the San Francisco-based 9th circuit court of appeals, which the Supreme Court reversed in eight out of 10 cases last year.</p> <p>It's the conflict between whales and sailors, though, that gives the case its sizzle.</p> <p>Underscoring the stakes - and perhaps as part of a bit of courtroom staging - an array of uniformed Navy officers sat prominently in the front row of the visitors section today.</p> <p>The Navy needs the southern California operating area for training exercises, which prepare naval strike groups for deployment to the Pacific Ocean and Middle East. Sailors use mid-frequency active sonar to detect otherwise hard-to-find submarines.</p> <p>The southern California coastal waters are also home to at least 37 species of marine mammals, including pygmy sperm whales, coastal bottlenose dolphins and endangered blue whales.</p> <p>The Navy's sonar produces piercing underwater sounds that Kendall said was 2,000 times louder than a jet engine. Some scientists say sonar use can cause hearing loss, cranial bleeding, behavioral modifications and mass strandings.</p> <p>A district court imposed additional safety measures on the Navy, including stopping sonar use when marine mammals were spotted within 2,200 yards and powering down the sonar under certain other conditions.</p> <p>\"The Navy is perfectly able to train under these circumstances,\" Kendall said.<br>The Bush administration's council on environmental quality declared \"emergency circumstances\" existed, which the administration argues should dissolve the district court's training limitations. Administration officials also dispute the extent of harm, noting that Navy exercises have been taking place off the southern California coast for the past four decades.</p> <p>\"No marine mammals will be killed as a result of these exercises,\" Solicitor General Gregory Garre told the court. \"They hear the [sonar] sound, and they go in the opposition direction. It also has some temporary effect on their feeding patterns.\"</p> <p>Justice David Souter pressed Garre vigorously, insisting that the Navy may have brought the emergency circumstances on itself, but justice Anthony Kennedy added that a presidential declaration of military necessity \"certainly must be given great weight\".</p> <p>Kendall predicted the court should rule within two months, prior to the next - and final - training session planned for the southern California operating area.</p>",
  "<p>I feel a little sorry for Horace Engdahl, although not too sorry. His comments to American journalists last week gave us a glimpse into how the mind of at least one Nobel literature prize judge works, and it wasn't pretty. American writers, en masse, he claimed, were <a href=\"http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/E/EU_NOBEL_LITERATURE?SITE=MOSPL&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT\">\"too sensitive to trends in their own mass culture\"</a>. Then he launched into one of those incoherent anti-American rants that somehow transformed all of American literature into Sarah Palin and George Bush: \"The US is too isolated, too insular. They don't translate enough and don't really participate in the big dialogue of literature,\" he said.</p> <p>It's unclear who \"they\" are in all of this. Presumably Engdahl meant US publishers, not US authors. Even so, he forgets that one of the largest of those publishers is now a fief of a multinational corporation based in Germany, where the bottom-line decisions are made. The remarks are so general as to be nonsensical. Where does that big dialogue of literature take place, actually, and how does one participate in it?</p> <p>Although he was not acting as a spokesperson for the Nobel academy, Engdahl's opinions have been taken as representative of the academy as a whole, or at least a majority of it. The AP story that broke Engdahl's views to the world also printed the predictably outraged and baffled responses of American editors and academicians, but did not bother to get any other members of the \"notoriously secretive\" prize committee on the record. Still, the prejudices of one man tend to cast doubt on the actual prestige of winning the award. What kind of a badge of excellence is it when a writer earns the approval of someone like that?</p> <p>Perhaps it's a good thing if American writers and cultural commentators learn to take the Swedish academy less seriously and see it for what it is, without hating it. A Nobel is now worth 10m Swedish crowns (somewhere between 1.3m and 100m new Bush bucks, depending on the outcome of the current economic crisis), but it has too long been misunderstood here as a certificate of literary excellence, the ultimate diploma.</p> <p>Like growing up to be president of the United States or going to Harvard University, winning a Nobel is a staple of America's striving class' dreams of competitive achievement. The promise of Nobel recognition dangles over the heads of American children, a hybrid of motivational carrot and sword of Damocles. The critic <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/id/2201447/pagenum/all/#page_start\">Adam Kirsch's impassioned riposte to Engdahl</a> is a perfect illustration that, when it comes to his prize, Americans really are still the na\u00efve and parochial boobs of Engdahl's legend. We want the award to matter as though presented by angels rather than a few, imperfect Swedes with their own biases and tastes.</p> <p>If we are shocked to discover that politics or some agenda external to mere aesthetics or \"excellence\", impinges on the judgment of literary work in an international context, we haven't been paying attention. The history of the prize is tied to Alfred Nobel's own broadly humanitarian aspirations to reward those who \"have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind\". Literature will always suffer from this kind of consequentialist standard, and the Swedes recognised this too. </p> <p>PTA-level Platonism has not always prevailed, but it's hard to escape entirely: the prize has gone to Samuel Beckett, Knut Hamsun, St John Perse, TS Eliot and a number of avant-garde pioneers. The Nobel's website offers browsers <a href=\"http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/articles/espmark/index.html\">an article from 1999</a> asserting the award has now become a truly literary prize, and it seemed true enough when VS Naipaul won in 2001. That award now seems somewhat anomalous out of the last 10. The committee seems to be tacking back toward a more \"originalist\" interpretation of Nobel's mandate. </p> <p>In the light of \"benefit to mankind\" rather than an Arnoldian \"Best That Has been Thought and Known\", Engdahl's weird remarks certainly start to make a bit of sense. The American contenders most often mentioned: Philip Roth, Joyce Carol Oates are not utopian novelists on a par with Doris Lessing (the prize winner in 2007). Don Delillo and Thomas Pynchon might be considered dystopian novelists. None of them are explicitly interventionist, situational polemicists like Elfriede Jelinek (2004) or late Harold Pinter (2005). It is difficult to imagine a citation for Philip Roth like the uplifting-sounding summation of Imre Kertesz (2002), \"for writing that upholds the fragile experience of the individual against the barbaric arbitrariness of history.\" So what if this gets Kertesz almost exactly backwards.</p> <p>Reading recent Nobel blurbs, since 1997, the contemporary differences between the Americans and the Swedes become most obvious. We want the award to signify the world's recognition of our particular genius - that is, we want them to acknowledge themselves in the great American writers they read, just as we do. Every award should read \"For outstanding literary achievement\", with no fancy stuff, because outstanding literary achievement means getting the world right. But the Swedes desperately want that writing to do something - \"to force entry into oppression's dark rooms\" (Pinter, 2005), for instance. </p> <p>There should be global prizes for this kind of interventionist, political writing, and apparently there is. It's called the Nobel prize. There should also be global prizes for literary excellence, even if that literature makes nothing happen. If anyone has any leftover money this time next year, maybe we should start one.</p>",
  "<p>Our economy is plummeting into the unknown. We go about our daily business as yet untouched by the disasters on the financial front. This is the phoney crash. We don't know how far we are going to fall, nor what kind of pain we'll feel when we hit the bottom. Doubt and uncertainty grip us. So who now owns the progressive future? Both the New Labour government and the new Conservatives are products of the neoliberal era that is disintegrating around us. Its rulebook has been torn up; and with that, the status quo has vanished.</p> <p>Across Europe, third way-style social democracy is in crisis. In response, the government resurrects <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/04/mandelson.gordonbrown\">Peter Mandelson</a> and the memory of its halcyon days. The old glory of New Labour will bring life to a zombie government. At their Birmingham conference, the Conservatives struggled to gain a foothold on solid ground. They found it in the memory of Margaret Thatcher. They, too, cannot escape the discredited orthodoxies of the past. In Birmingham David Cameron sounded like he'd given up trying. \"<a href=\"http://www.conservatives.com/News/Speeches/2008/10/ David_Cameron_Conference_Speech_2008.aspx\">I'm a man with a plan</a>\", he asserted. In truth, he has no plan. Until the New Conservatives give up their dogmatic belief in liberal market capitalism they're irrelevant to the crisis at hand.</p> <p>Alistair Darling has been resolutely irresolute. His tantalising promise of action which specified nothing sent a paranoid market into flight. Now at last the government has been forced to ditch its blind faith in markets. Its massive and unprecedented intervention will attempt to prop up the banks and stop the collapse of the wholesale <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/robertpeston/2008/10/a_very_big_rescue.html\">money markets</a>.</p> <p>Will it work? The banks must put up their hands: \"Please sir, I need some money\" \u2013 so confirming their weakness to the market. Will the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/robertpeston/\">market react</a> like a herd of wildebeest and stampede? Suddenly the truth of the system dawns. Like water, capital is almost impossible to control when in flood. This is a liquid economy. As one government attempts to shore up its collapsing banks, capital pours out across its national boundaries. The markets are amoral, and they are mindless. They need regulating \u2013 otherwise they pursue successful profit-seeking to destruction. They have no place in the governance and civic and social affairs of society.</p> <p>And yet markets have come to rule our lives and now threaten to destroy us. The so-called invisible hand is a charade that allows those who have to gain more. A tiny unaccountable elite has manipulated economic activity in order to enrich itself. The profound absence in this crisis is our collective sense of democratic agency. Today's unprecedented measures have been forced upon a reluctant, timid government. And yet they have to be the first step in the fundamental structural reform of liberal market capitalism. Democracy must assert itself over capitalism. Where is the politics capable of seizing this moment?</p> <p>The markets cannot be allowed to manage people's long-term social security or pension schemes. The principle of social insurance has to be reasserted. Markets cannot be allowed to deliver welfare reform, nor are they suitable for allocating the resources of care and health provision. The market has created a crisis in housing provision. Privatisation and proxy markets have undermined the ethos of public service and led to dysfunctional, demoralised organisations. The culture of capitalism has invaded every aspect of British society. Its logic of profit-seeking, its nihilism and instrumental drive toward efficiency and cost-reduction destroys creativity, and is profoundly at odds with the promotion of human wellbeing.</p> <p>The credit culture that has driven our consumer society and turned our homes into commodities has been a modern form of exploitation. Systemic irresponsible lending has expropriated people's often meagre wages to create continuous revenues of debt repayments that have redistributed wealth to the rich via the financial markets. The credit culture has created an illusion of plenitude and affluence which disguises the millions who are paying back debt like a form of indentured labour.</p> <p>There are more storms brewing on the horizon \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/07/globaleconomy.oil\">global warming</a>, <a href=\"http://www.peakoil.net/\">peak oil</a>, <a href=\"http://www.circleofblue.org\">water scarcity</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/food\">food insecurity</a> are rolling towards us. These are momentous, frightening times. The fundamentals of our economy, the sustainability of human life are under threat. This is no time for timid, piecemeal politics. A retreat into the past is only a reminder of the causes of this economic free fall. The future will demand a more active and democratic state engaging with economic development and regulation. The redistribution of wealth and resources will be essential in rebalancing a dysfunctional economy.

  "<p>Ahead of the World Bank annual meeting in Washington this weekend, an alliance of US environmental campaigners today stepped up their criticism of the Bank's proposed funds to combat climate change.</p> <p>The Bank's climate investment funds were unveiled in July, when 10 industrialised nations pledged $6.1bn (\u00a33.5bn) in aid to developing nations to fight the threat of rising global temperatures. </p> <p>But environmental groups as well as some representatives from developing nations have condemned the Bank for attempting to set climate policy while continuing to fund large fossil fuel-burning projects such as the planned Tata Mundra coal plant in India. </p> <p>The same concerns about the Bank's involvement with coal projects have prompted the US Congress to delay approval for an American contribution to the climate funds.</p> <p>\"The Bank is proposing that the solution to this problem of climate change is advocating cheap energy in the form of coal, that coal is integral in overcoming poverty,\" Janet Redman, a research director at the Institute for Policy Studies, a liberal-leaning US think tank, told reporters today.</p> <p>Redman called the climate funds \"a classic move of the World Bank, which is to announce something that doesn't have the critical buy-in it needs to move forward\".<br> Republican senator Pete Domenici and other coal supporters in the US have cheered the proposed climate funds, although Congress is unlikely to authorise an American share until next year. </p> <p>Developing nations in the so-called Group of 77 also have pushed back against the Bank's climate funds, contending that the UN should take the lead on climate policy in preparation for next year's Copenhagen talks on a global emissions treaty. <br> \"We are very concerned by the Bank's attempt to control global financing policy on climate,\" Brent Blackwelder, president of Friends of the Earth US, said. \"The World Bank is a major climate polluter, a major deforester.\"</p> <p>The global financial meltdown - which prompted a US government rescue plan more than 100 times the size of the proposed climate funds - is likely to dominate the Bank and International Monetary Fund meeting, pushing climate change further down the agenda.</p> <p>Uncertainty about evaporating worldwide credit could ultimately help by dissuading the Bank from pursuing a solely market-based climate policy, according to Bernarditas Muller, lead coordinator for the Group of 77 and China during last year's UN climate talks in Bali.</p> <p>\"We've been told that the market will solve the problem,\" Muller said. \"What's happening right now shows very clearly that markets will not necessarily, or even not at all, solve the problem.\"</p> <p>Another controversial aspect of the proposed climate funds is the possibility that wealthier nations will offer aid <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/may/16/climatechange.internationalaidanddevelopment\" ?>in the form of loans</a>, requiring developing countries to pay back the money with interest.</p> <p>Redman, of the Institute for Policy Studies, said the loan-based structuring risks \"undermining climate justice\". She pointed to a sunset clause in the proposed funds that allow the Bank to step aside if the UN reaches a deal on a new global climate treaty next year. </p> <p>The UK government has defended the funds as innovative. Phil Woolas, the environment minister, and Gareth Thomas, the trade and development minister, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/may/19/carbonemissions.climatechange\">wrote to the Guardian</a> in May that the proposal would \"influence [the Bank's] lending to move in the right directions\".</p>",
  "<p>A Republican economist and adviser to John McCain said today that the current economic downturn could last longer than the previous four recessions, a gloomy view for a campaign that hopes to turn the national conversation away from the economy in the remaining weeks of the presidential race.</p> <p>Martin Feldstein, a Harvard University economist who advised presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush Sr, this afternoon blamed a continuing decline in house prices for the dire situation. He said the $700bn economic rescue package passed last week by the US Congress fails to sufficiently address problems in the housing market.</p> <p>\"Home prices still have some distance to fall just to get back to the pre-bubble level,\" Feldstein said on Bloomberg television. \"The danger is that it'll just keep going, as individuals default on mortgages and that leads to foreclosures, and the foreclosures add to the stock of unsold homes\".</p> <p>Feldstein said that 10m homes have negative equity, meaning homeowners owe more on property than it's worth on the market, and those homeowners have an incentive to default on mortgages.</p> <p>He proposed the US government offer to buy portions of mortgages from every homeowner in American, in exchange for a new loan at a lower interest rate. He said that would stop the \"downward spiral\" of house prices, while giving participating homeowners a lower cost of servicing their mortgages.</p> <p>In a Wall Street Journal article published on Saturday, Feldstein said the plan could cost as much as $1tn, but it would not be comparable to an outlay of that size on government programmes. That is because the homeowners would be required to repay the government-provided loans.</p> <p>As the global economic crisis has worsened, McCain's campaign has faltered while Barack Obama has risen in polls both nationally and in key swing states. Polling indicates voters trust Obama more than McCain to manage the crisis.</p> <p>The McCain campaign has sought to turn voters' attention from the economy and onto Obama's character, for example by pointing to his association in Chicago with a 1960s-era radical who was part of a violent anti-Vietnam war protest organisation. </p> <p>Perhaps sensing that tack had failed to gain traction, in last night's debate McCain proposed a $300bn plan under which the US government would purchase mortgages from troubled homeowners and replace them with more affordable loans. The Obama campaign maintains that the US treasury department already has that authority under the rescue plan passed last week.</p>",
  "<p>In the single biggest spend by any chancellor of the exchequer ever, Alistair Darling <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/08/marketturmoil.creditcrunch\">has committed up to \u00a3500bn</a> to saving the UK's banks from a crisis of their own making. This level of commitment is essential \u2013 yet Alistair Darling's plan is fundamentally flawed.<br> Listening to Darling speak, it would be easy to think the investment he is making is in a modest portfolio of shares for his personal pension fund from which he hopes to make a little dividend income and a long-term capital gain. It isn't. It's enough to have purchased Lloyds TSBH, RBS, Barclays and HBOS outright last night.  That means the investment is enough to let him demand a paradigm shift in the way in which British financial services are managed forever. It's a shift most commentators realise is needed. Anglo-Saxon capitalism has failed. Our \"light touch\" regulation has been a disaster. The directors of our banks have been reckless. The shareholders \u2013 in effect, our pension funds \u2013 have lost enormously, and so, now, will all taxpayers. The investment in equity alone is almost half of NHS annual spending. There will be no government spending programme, whether it be health, education, law and order or the environment that will not be adversely affected by this commitment of funds for years to come.  Despite that, Alistair Darling is asking for almost nothing in exchange, just <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/08/gordonbrown.economy\">some modest pay caps</a> and restraint on dividends: dividends the banks will not be able to pay in any case, since they are, for all practical purposes, bust right now.<br> As a result, Darling is missing the chance to take control of our banks: to demand they repatriate profits to the UK from those locations where they have hidden them offshore and out of his clutches in years gone by. He is not sacking those most responsible for creating the mess when he should. He is not forcing the banks to close down their massive speculative activities and to turn instead to investing in the real capacity of the UK to make a living for itself. He's not requiring that immediate action be taken to protect investors or mortgage holders who are in trouble: the people who will be paying for this bail-out. He's not asking the banks to float off their profitable activities to pay back his cash at the first possible opportunity as any commercial investor would. He's not putting his people in charge to ensure that these banks comply with the requirements of regulation, disclosure and accountability henceforth. Unbelievably, he's simply gifting more taxpayers' money than has ever been spent in a single day to those who have proven their unlimited capacity to lose it. </p> <p>This will be a disaster for us all \u2013 and all because he and the Treasury are still frightened of bankers. It's a fear they need to be put behind them. These people are fallible. So is the system they have promoted. It's time Darling placed his faith in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/08/creditcrunch.banking\">the awkward squad</a>: those who have stood outside the system and criticised it, even when all around said it was delivering wealth. It is they who saw through the illusion. It is they who should now be sitting on the boards of these banks. </p> <p>Now, it is the job of the House of Commons to make him change his mind about this. The House of Representatives <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/03/creditcrunch.useconomy2\">demanded that Paulson be held to account</a>. Can our MPs do the same for Darling? It is their democratic duty to do so.</p>",

Stockmarkets tumbled despite a \u00a3500bn bank rescue package from the British government and unprecedented interest rate cuts from the world's key central banks.</p> <p>The prime minister, Gordon Brown, put his government's credibility on the line as he risked potentially vast sums of public money to save the UK's banking system. \"This is not a time for outdated thinking or conventional dogma. Extraordinary times call for bold and far-reaching solutions,\" he said, promising that the plan would \"show that we have led the world in changing the terms and conditions on which we can help to renew the flow of money in the system.\"</p> <p>The plan was generally welcomed by the City, but investors were concerned about the lack of detail, which reflected the speed with which it had been drawn up. Investors fear that if the plan does not work, they are staring into the abyss of a possible collapse of the banking system.</p> <p>Yesterday's dramatic actions included:</p> <p>\u00b7 Britain pledging \u00a350bn to buy stakes in its major banks;</p> <p>\u00b7 A further \u00a3450bn allocated to underpin banks' finances;</p> <p>\u00b7 Unprecedented coordinated rate cuts made by central banks;</p> <p>\u00b7 The IMF warning of global recession.</p> <p>In London, \u00a357bn was wiped off the value of shares after the Bank of England cut its key interest rate by half a point to 4.5%, a move matched by seven other central banks, including the US Federal Reserve and European Central Bank.</p> <p>The chancellor, Alistair Darling, was last night preparing to fly to Washington for crisis talks with top financial officials from the Group of Seven leading economies, including the US treasury secretary, Henry Paulson, and the Federal Reserve chief, Ben Bernanke, about global efforts to address the credit crunch.</p> <p>The British government was forced to rush out its bank rescue plan yesterday morning after precipitous share price falls in leading banks on Tuesday. Bank bosses and Darling hammered out the basics of a package overnight, but the details are not yet fully worked out.</p> <p>The plan was bolder and broader than expected, extending to seven major banks as well as Nationwide building society. In return for taxpayers' money, executives will have to curb bonuses, hold back share dividends and pledge to continue lending to homeowners and small businesses.</p> <p>Robert Talbut, chief investment officer of Royal London Asset Management, said the announcement was short on detail. \"I was hoping there would be more certainty over the capital-raising by the banks. The suspicion is that the authorities got bumped into this announcement.\"</p> <p>Stockmarkets, initially buoyed by the authorities' action, later sold off heavily as investors remained worried that the rot had still not been removed from the US banking system, where the toxic sub-prime mortgage crisis originated.</p> <p>The FTSE 100 dropped 5.2% to finish at 4,366, its lowest close since August 2004 and lower than it stood when Labour came to power in May 1997. It was the 10th biggest percentage fall ever. The Dow Jones industrial average in the US lost another 2%, falling by 189.01 to close at 9258.10.</p> <p>\"The coordinated interest rate cuts got the 'thumbs down' from equity markets, suggesting we have not yet turned the corner in this crisis,\" said Roger Bootle, a veteran analyst at Capital Economics.</p> <p>The shadow chancellor, George Osborne, demanded that the government extract promises that City bonuses would be reined in as a condition of the deal. \"There should not be rewards for failure - no bonuses for those who took their banks to the edge of bankruptcy,\" he told a packed House of Commons.</p> <p>The IMF warned yesterday that Britain would next year suffer its first full year of recession since 1991, as the global economy enters a \"major downturn\" triggered by the most dangerous financial shock since the 1930s. In a gloomy half-yearly report, the IMF slashed its growth forecasts for the UK for 2009 from 1.7% to -0.1% - a sharper reduction than for any other major economy.</p> <p>\"The major advanced economies are already in, or close to recession, and although a recovery is projected in 2009, the pickup is likely to be unusually gradual,\" the IMF said.</p> <p>Germany's finance minister, Peer Steinbr\u00fcck, wrote to his G7 counterparts saying that the recent market turbulence \"underscores the fact that we are not even close to being out of the woods yet\".</p> <p>France's President, Nicolas Sarkozy, who holds the rotating EU presidency, called for more joint European action to quell the turmoil.</p> <p>There was some relief for homeowners as most commercial banks announced they would cut their base rates by the full half -point from November 1.</p> <p>Treasury officials said the risk to the taxpayer of the rescue package was minimal and it could even turn a profit. But Robert Chote, head of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said there could be a \"nightmare scenario\" for the public finances if several big banks were to collapse.</p> <p>While most of the participating banks encouraged the government to produce its plan, Michael Geoghegan, chief executive of the UK's biggest bank, HSBC, warned that it set a dangerous precedent. \"I don't think it is right that the British taxpayer should need to bail out banks ... It sets a bad precedent, but the government had no alternative,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>With domestic and global attention turned to the financial crisis and the last four weeks of the race for the White House, the Bush administration is taking the opportunity to quietly check off some nefarious boxes in its efforts to spread the American culture wars beyond our shores. <br> Last week, the UK-based <a href=\"http://www.mariestopes.org.uk/\">Marie Stopes International</a>, which fairly calls itself \"one of the world's leading family planning institutions\", received a letter leaders of the organisation had been both dreading and expecting since June. Penned by Kent Hill, assistant administrator at <a href=\"http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/\">USAID's bureau for global health</a>, it <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/04/usa.internationalaidanddevelopment\">dropped an anvil</a>.</p> <p>\"In light of the restrictions on USAID assistance and MSI's work as the major implementing partner of [the UN Population Fund]'s programme in China, which supports China's family planning programme, USAID has concluded that it is not appropriate for MSI to receive USAID funded contraceptives and/or condoms from host country governments,\" Hill wrote, even though MSI doesn't itself receive any USAID funding itself.</p> <p>The reason? The Kemp-Kasten Amendment, a lesser-known restriction on global population control organisations that purports to thwart groups that engage in coercive abortion or forced sterilisation. Sounds like a no-brainer - after all, who supports coercive abortion? But the application of Kemp-Kasten, which was enacted in 1985, has been wielded by Republican administrations since Ronald Reagan as a legislative sledgehammer that fits hand-in-glove with the so-called <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/21/usa.sexeducation\">global gag rule</a> that restricts any family planning organisation that even mentions abortion. Since 2002, the Bush administration has <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/g/prm/rls/12128.htm\">cited Kemp-Kasten</a> in its annual decision to <a href=\"http://www.undispatch.com/archives/2008/06/no_us_funding_f.php\">withhold our $39.7m in yearly dues from the UN Population Fund (UNFPA)</a>.<br> The impact? In his letter USAID's Hill went on to say that countries working with MSI had been instructed, effective immediately, to no longer work with MSI. At least six African countries will lose MSI's distribution of crucial USAID-supplied contraceptives and condoms in rural and remote areas and urban slums. The nations affected include Ghana, Malawi, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Uganda and Zimbabwe, countries for whom MSI currently covers some 25% of contraceptive distribution.</p> <p>For the Bush administration, which touts its HIV/Aids strategy in Africa as one of its major success stories, cracking down on condom distribution in Africa seems a far cry from implementing comprehensive disease-control efforts. Not to mention the fact that American politicians in general \u2013 even Sarah Palin \u2013 claim that reducing the number of abortions is a worthy and admirable goal. And yet by undermining the effort to distribute the means to prevent pregnancy and disease, USAID has slashed both such efforts.</p> <p>In a statement, <a href=\"http://www.planetwire.org/details/7829\">MSI outlined the potential consequences</a> of such a move:</p> <blockquote> <p>MSI's family planning services prevented 5-7 million unwanted pregnancies in 2007 alone, thus preventing 1-1.5 million abortions. Most of these abortions would have been unsafe, putting women's lives at risk. \"For every two intra-uterine devices (IUDs) the US government denies MSI, an unsafe abortion could result unless MSI is able to find alternative supplies,\" MSI president Dana Hovig explained.</p> </blockquote> <p>It's no secret that China's family planning programme is deemed coercive. Fears of forced sterilisations have existed for years. But MSI and UNFPA have long argued that their work in no way supports forced sterilisation or coerced abortions \u2013 a point verified by independent observers. Instead they give women safe means for controlling their own bodies.</p> <p>Craig Larsen, a senior policy analyst at <a href=\"http://www.populationaction.org/\">Population Action International</a>, explained to me that organisations like Marie Stopes had feared a crackdown as far back as June. A few sentences issued by USAID indicated the organisation was beginning to look into expanding the reach of the Kemp-Kasten Amendment, though no one knew exactly where USAID was taking that veiled threat. <br> The hypocrisy of the Bush administration knows no bounds. This is a policy that will not have an impact on China at all. Indeed, for impact on China, perhaps President Bush might have considered not attending the Beijing Olympics and lustily partaking in the celebration of Chinese culture. In a letter to Condoleezza Rice protesting the recent restraints placed on MSI, Nita Lowey, a New York congresswoman, pointed out that the US government itself, in a 2001 assessment of the UNFPA, also rejected the case for UN programmes supporting any kind of unsavoury Chinese policies.  As I <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/21/usa.sexeducation\">wrote</a> back in July, the World Bank estimates that 51 million unintended pregnancies take place globally every year, 68,000 women die from botched or unsafe abortions each year and 5.1 million are left permanently disabled by them. The World Bank drew a direct link between giving women access to contraception and family planning and boosting economic growth and ending endemic poverty and maternal and infant death.</p> <p>But the Bush administration is more interested in expanding our ugly culture wars than helping women internationally. With this move, USAID has put in place a stumbling block even for an incoming Obama administration. Whereas the global gag rule has become a must-undo for Democrats upon entering office (Bill Clinton repealed the original gag rule the moment he walked into 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue in 1993, and Obama would likely do the same) and likewise reinstated by Republicans (Bush II immediately signed the gag rule back into effect in 2001), Kemp-Kasten must be reviewed by state department lawyers and legislators to be reassessed.</p> <p>All of which means that, though Obama would surely put in motion the wheels to roll back such obvious political measures, it will take months, not days, even with a Democratic administration, to reinstate Marie Stopes's efforts to distribute IUDs and condoms in Africa. That means months of no distribution, months of women used as pawns in a Republican game that ruins or ends lives halfway around the world as a means of placating their supporters here at home.</p>",
  "<p>The day after the launch of the stylish <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global/blog/2008/oct/07/windows.microsoft\">S101 netbook in Taiwan</a>, I had a brief interview with Jerry Shen, chief executive of Asus. I asked him what proportion of Eee PC netbook sales were Windows XP rather than Linux. Surprisingly, he told me. But he didn't tell me quite enough.</p> <p>Shen -- who is keen on Linux -- said Asus had hoped sales of Eee PCs would be 50:50 between XP and Linux, but actually they were 60:40 in XP's favour. (I assume that's for this calendar year.) So far, around 4m have been sold, and the target is 5m for this year.<br><br>Linux got about 6 months start over XP, including four months this calendar year, so the market has swung XP's way. However, it's impossible to say where it will end up.</p> <p>I asked several Asus staff about figures for returns, but none thought that more Linux machines were being returned to stores. This is not the case at MSI, where Andy Tung, the Director of US Sales, told <a href=\"http://blog.laptopmag.com/msi-wind-coming-to-major-retailer-new-models-coming-soon\">Laptop magazine</a>: \"The return rate is at least four times higher for Linux netbooks than Windows XP netbooks.\" He said:</p> <blockquote> <p>People would love to pay $299 or $399 but they don't know what they get until they open the box. They start playing around with Linux and start realizing that it's not what they are used to. They don't want to spend time to learn it so they bring it back to the store. </p> </blockquote> <p>After trash-talking Microsoft and launching with a Linux netbook, Acer is also shipping XP, and that became its best seller at Amazon.com.

  "<p>To fix a global financial crisis, global cooperation is vital. Earlier this week, European countries failed to coordinate their efforts to support their respective banking systems. The result was beggar-thy-neighbour moves, which increased the chaos. Until today's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/08/interestrates.banking\">coordinated rate cut</a> by central banks across the world, the prospects of coordination looked dim.</p> <p>One obvious question to ask is: where is International Monetary Fund? Created by governments to avoid beggar-thy-neighbour policies, to facilitate cooperation among governments, and to contribute to global financial stability, the IMF is curiously marginal. It is standing on the sidelines of the crisis, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/08/recession.globaleconomy\">offering opinions</a>. It is not at the heart of cooperation to resolve this crisis. Central bank governors and finance ministers from across the world have not headed straight for the headquarters of the IMF to find a collective solution. Why not?</p> <p>The crisis exposes the extent to which the IMF mirrors a bygone era in which the United States was the world's largest creditor and led the G7 countries in giving strategic direction, headquarters and direction to the IMF. Left out of that directorate are emerging economies such as China, Russia, the Gulf States, India and Brazil, which, among other things, now sit on huge reserves (mostly dollar-denominated). These reserves give them a nuclear-like (mutually assured destruction) capability to create havoc in the global monetary system \u2013 but also the resources to help recapitalise broken financial sectors in the G7.</p> <p>Most emerging economies have no more than a cursory interest in the IMF. Politely, they will send representatives to the organisation's meetings. But they do not see the organisation as theirs, nor even partially theirs. They do not trust it as a political forum within which to negotiate, nor as an institution that will establish and apply rules with an even hand. </p> <p>Reinvigorating the IMF requires a transformation of the rules of headship, decision-making, staffing, the structure and workings of the board and the location and authority of the institution. If the IMF is to offer a forum for cooperation, it will need a dramatic overhaul, going well beyond what is to be discussed in Washington DC at the IMF annual meeting this week. This cannot be achieved without creating an institution that powerful reserve-holding countries come to see as \"theirs\".</p>",
  "<p>Again, too little, too late. While the finance sector and the world's debtors must have noticed that central banks <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/08/interestrates.banking\">co-ordinated a 0.5% cut in interest rates</a>, be sure they cared little. The fact is, this cut makes virtually no difference to their very high borrowing costs or to the threat that bankruptcy poses. </p> <p>Imagine the impact of such a cut on a small businesswoman with staffing and other overheads, with customers shutting their purses and walking away, and with an overdraft of \u00a350,000. She may now pay 14.5% instead of 15% interest on that debt. Or imagine the impact on a company with outstanding loans of \u00a35m or a financial institution with liabilities of \u00a35bn. </p> <p>It is far too little, far too late. Furthermore, this cut will not necessarily affect the Libor (London interbank offered rate), which has been ratcheting upwards and which, <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=a0JbUyhTA71Y&amp;refer=home\">according to Bloomberg</a>, is applied to trillions of dollars of debt, including the mortgages of a million American homeowners.</p> <p>Central bankers and finance ministers gave away control over that crucial rate to the private sector, as part of the dogma of deregulation. They are thus bereft of a crucial lever needed to contain this financial firestorm. </p> <p>But while central bankers still maintain control over the official policy or base rate, they have failed to use it to deal with this crisis. Why? Because they cannot see past the neoliberal argument that inflation is the gravest threat of all, and that to contain inflation, rates have to stay high.</p> <p>Furthermore, they have been given a political mandate \u2013 from Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling and endorsed by George Osborne \u2013 to regard inflation as a graver threat than say, prolonged and systemic global economic failure. For let us not forget the Bank of England is not an independent central bank. It remains in public ownership. Its governor, Mervyn King, is a public servant, and the monetary policy committee has a very clear political remit to treat inflation as the number one threat. </p> <p>The Treasury, the Bank of England and the European Central Bank have relished playing this role: the hard men of high interest rates. It was these high real rates of interest that precipitated the \"debtonation\" in August 2007. </p> <p>On October 2 this year, you and I, reading our newspapers, knew that a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/marketturmoil\">global financial meltdown</a> was in the offing. That a very big bank, Hypo Real Estate Holding, Germany's second-largest property lender, was collapsing. On that day the governor of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/03/europeanbanks.banking\">announced solemnly</a> that rates for the whole of the eurozone would not budge.</p> <p>Back in the summer, Trichet seemed to welcome the political unease of European politicians who questioned his decision to keep rates high. \"Bring 'em on,\" he seemed to be saying. \"The more democratic challenges there are to my authority, the more of a hard man that proves me to be; the greater price stability, the sounder our financial system.\" If it were not so tragic, one would have to laugh. </p> <p>Central bankers and finance ministers must dismiss the charlatans of economic orthodoxy and face the most blatantly obvious fact about this global financial meltdown: that it is borrowing costs, not liquidity shortages, that are bankrupting banks, companies, households and individuals. Slashing those costs urgently will do more, and cost taxpayers a lot less, than billions of pounds spent recapitalising banks.</p>",
  "<p>You might think that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/lehmanbrothers\">Lehman Brothers'</a> boss, Dick Fuld, would be chastened by presiding over the bankruptcy of one of Wall Street's most distinguished banks. He isn't. </p> <p>Wearing an unapologetic scowl, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/video/2008/oct/07/richard.fuld.congress.lehman\">Fuld spent three hours explaining to Congress this week</a> why it wasn't his fault that a 158-year-old institution evaporated under his watch. In scattergun fashion, he blamed the Federal Reserve, naked short-sellers, a \"systemic\" lack of confidence, media sensationalising and inconsistent regulation.</p> <p>\"Not that anyone on this committee cares about this but I wake up every single night wondering what I could have done differently,\" barked Fuld at one point. He usually manages to go back to sleep, though, because he thinks all his decisions were \"prudent and appropriate\" given the information he had at the time.</p> <p>A day later, the House oversight committee heard a similar refrain from the two men who ran the world's biggest insurance company, AIG, in the months before it had to beg the US government for an $85bn (\u00a350bn) loan to stay in business.</p> <p>Using tortured logic, AIG's erstwhile chief executive, Robert Willumstad, and his British-born predecessor, Martin Sullivan, tried to offload responsibility by blaming the rules of accounting for the firm's near collapse.</p> <p>The principle of mark-to-market accounting, complained Willumstad, forced AIG to write off billions of dollars of unrealised losses on obscure investments in swaps and derivatives because the things were rendered unsale-able when the credit markets froze.</p> <p>\"Looking back on my time as CEO, I don't believe AIG could have done anything differently,\" Willumstad said. \"The market seizure was an unprecedented global catastrophe.\"</p> <p>This shrugging of expensively tailored shoulders is pretty unsavoury stuff. It begs a simple question \u2013 where does the buck stop in business if a chief executive can keep a straight face while disclaiming all responsibility for the collapse of a major corporation?</p> <p>The absurd sums earned by Wall Street figures are well trodden ground \u2013 Fuld agreed to the committee that he had pocketed somewhere between $250m and $350m over the last eight years - and in terms of public esteem, corporate bosses are held somewhere close to arsonists. <br><a href=\"http://community.marketwatch.com/groups/us-politics/topics/ceo---chief-embezzlement-officer\">One email circulating this week</a> offered a spoof glossary of terms for the global financial crisis. It suggested that CEO stands for \"chief embezzlement officer\" while CFO means \"corporate fraud officer\".</p> <p>None of the men before Congress this week spent much time addressing the fundamental fault which led to the present debacle \u2013 an excess of reckless financial risk-taking by banks and financial firms in search of short-term gains. </p> <p>Lehman was one of Wall Street's biggest and earliest enthusiasts for sub-prime mortgages, dabbling as far back as the late 1990s. It paid insufficient attention to the underlying values of the properties backing these loans \u2013 a straightforward failure of judgement and of management. In its earnings for the three months to August, which proved to be the bank's final straw, Lehman lost $3.9bn after taking a $5.3bn hit on the value of its portfolio of residential mortgages. Whose fault was that?</p> <p>Similarly, AIG delved into insurance policies intended to protect clients against the risk of default on mortgage-related derivatives. Senior bosses allowed a London-based unit specialising in these policies to run out of control. Since the credit markets seized up, AIG has had to write off an eye-watering $25.9bn on its exposure to bad debts, according to evidence put before Congress.</p> <p>The chorus from the boardrooms of financial institutions is that these types of write-downs do not represent real losses but merely an unintended consequence of a book-keeping rule, FAS 157, which requires investments to be stated at a snapshot of their present sale-able value.</p> <p>\"When there is no market, the value of securities based on FAS 157 becomes somewhat difficult and requires a certain amount of judgement,\" said Willumstad, who ran AIG for just three months in the run-up to its bail-out. \"It obviously resulted in substantial write-downs which were, obviously, not helpful to the company.\"</p> <p>For mere mortals, this is a baffling argument. Carolyn Maloney, a Democratic congresswoman from New York, sounded as if she couldn't quite believe what she was hearing.</p> <p>\"You were just gambling billions, possibly trillions of dollars,\" she said. \"You blame accountants for coming forward, looking at the accounts and saying something has no value because nobody in the entire world wants to buy it.\"</p> <p>A former chief accountant at the Securities and Exchange Commission, Lynn Turner, echoed this critique, telling the committee that AIG's attempt to blame accounting rules was \"like blaming the thermometer for a fever\".</p> <p>There was much mealy-mouthed waffle from dethroned executives about how pained they are at recent events. Fuld, who is nicknamed \"the gorilla\", said he felt \"horrible\". Sullivan declared himself \"heartbroken\". Willumstad didn't articulate his feelings, although he at least felt obliged to turn down a $22m golden parachute for three months' work.</p> <p>Perhaps a bit of further reflection would help. Instead of a payoff, how about an alternative farewell to departing executives? They should all be sent on a yogic retreat, perhaps to an ashram somewhere in India, to meditate and contemplate on how it all went wrong. Maybe when they get back, they'll be ready to say sorry.</p>",

Just hours earlier, the prime minister had taken the momentous decision to part-nationalise <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/banking\">Britain's banks</a>.</p> <p>The Bank of England said that it was acting because the outlook for economic activity in the United Kingdom has \"deteriorated substantially, reflecting a sharp monetary contraction\". It had been due to announce its decision on rates tomorrow.</p> <p>Shares in London fluctuated wildly today, with the FTSE 100 index plunging by as much as 360 points, or 7.8%, in early trading before rallying after the rate cuts. But the moves by the government and the Bank of England appeared not to be enough to restore confidence. The FTSE 100 closed down almost 5.2%, dropping 238.5 points, to 4366.7. Trading was just as dizzying on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average was trading 223 points lower at 9223 at 5.30pm.</p> <p>UK government ministers and bank officials thrashed out the details of the banking rescue plan into the early hours of the morning.</p> <p>The \u00a3500bn rescue scheme comes in three parts:</p> <p>\u2022 \u00a350bn of taxpayers' money will be offered to banks to rebuild their capital reserves<br>\u2022 \u00a3200bn of liquidity is being made available as short-term loans in an attempt to thaw the frozen interbank lending markets. This is twice as much as was previouly offered under the Special Liquidity Scheme<br>\u2022 A further \u00a3250bn will underwrite lending between banks - another attempt to shore up their balance sheets.</p> <p>The \u00a350bn part-nationalisation section of the scheme is equivalent to \u00a32,000 for every taxpayer in the UK, and analysts warned today that the public will \"foot the bill\" for the plan. </p> <p>The Treasury said that seven banks and one building society will take part - Abbey, Barclays, HBOS, HSBC, Lloyds TSB, Nationwide Building Society, Royal Bank of Scotland and Standard Chartered. </p> <p>Barclays and RBS have already said they will participate in the scheme, but HSBC has insisted that it has no plans to do so.</p> <p>Gordon Brown said that the package was a \"bold and far-reaching solution\" to the crisis and would help every family and business in the country.</p> <p>\"This is not a time for conventional thinking or outdated dogma but for fresh and innovative intervention that gets to the heart of the problem,\" he said.</p> <p>Brown also claimed that taxpayers would be protected and would earn \"a proper return\".</p> <p>But Jeremy Batstone-Carr, an analyst at Charles Stanley, said that \"ultimately government borrowing will increase and ultimately we, the taxpayer, will foot the bill\". He also suggested that \u00a350bn may not be enough to rescue the banking system.</p> <p><strong>An end to fat-cat pay?</strong></p> <p>The complex scheme announced this morning suggests that the government has insisted on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/oct/08/gordonbrown.economy\">a crackdown on the pay packages of top banking executives</a> in return for rescuing them. </p> <p>\"In reaching agreement on capital investment the government will need to take into account dividend policies and executive compensation practices and will require a full commitment to support lending to small businesses and homebuyers,\" said the Treasury.</p> <p>According to Darling, the plan will \"unbung\" the banking sector.</p> <p>\"It is a process that inevitably will take time. It is not an instant change but it is a restructuring, it is stabilising the system, and that is very important,\" the chancellor said.</p> <p>Asked why the government had not come up with the package earlier, he said that the discussion had been going on for several weeks and had been very complex. </p> <p>He said he was \"rather irritated by the speculation started on Sunday,\" adding: \"I wanted to announce it when the time was right, when we had got everything sorted out, we had a scheme that worked and the big banks were signed up to it.\"</p> <p><strong>Liquidity injection</strong></p> <p>The government will use \u00a350bn to buy preference shares in the banks, which take precedence over ordinary shares during a liquidation, but do not give the holders any voting rights.</p> <p>The \u00a3200bn of lending announced today comes through the Special Liquidity Scheme, which allows banks to get short-term funding from the Bank of England by swapping long-term bonds for short-term UK Treasury Bills.</p> <p>Separately, the government will provide guarantees to the banking system of up to \u00a3250bn to encourage banks to lend to each other and end the paralysis in the interbank lending markets. The Treasury stressed though that it will charge normal commercial fees for these guarantees.</p> <p>The plan comes after a succession of tumultuous days on the stockmarket. Yesterday Royal Bank of Scotland shares slumped by 39% and HBOS lost 40%. It was reported this morning that the RBS chief executive, Sir Fred Goodwin, and the chairman, Sir Tom McKillop, are stepping down, but there was no official announcement from the bank and sources have denied the story.</p> <p>RBS and Barclays are thought to need \u00a315bn each in fresh capital, with Lloyds TSB requiring \u00a312bn - assuming its takeover of HBOS goes through.</p> <p>Shares in HBOS surged by 60% today but fell back to close up 24.5% at 117p. Royal Bank of Scotland was trading 22% in early trade but closed pretty much flat at 90.7p.</p>",
  "<p>With today's unprecedented combination of a \u00a3500bn bail-out for Britain's banks and a co-ordinated interest rate cut by the world's leading central banks, there seems little left in the locker if the market is still not reassured.</p> <p>Well, so far the market is anything but reassured. In yet another day of wild swings and volatile trading, the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> closed down 238.5 points at 4366.7, a 5.18% decline and its lowest level since 19 August 2004. Around \u00a357bn was wiped off the value of Britain's top companies.</p> <p>During the day the leading index climbed as high as 4654 and fell as low as 4245. Meanwhile the <strong>FTSE 250</strong> mid-cap index closed 230.3 points lower at 7200.9.</p> <p>The initial euphoria after the midday announcement of the global move to knock 50 basis points off interest rates soon wore off, especially after an opening tumble on Wall Street. Investors are worried the day's measures will not be enough to avoid recession, something which was reinforced by poor figures from aluminium group Alcoa and a profit warning from insurer MetLife.</p> <p>By the time London closed the Dow Jones Industrial Average was around 100 points lower, while gold jumped nearly 5% as investors stuck to the theory it was a safe haven in turbulent times.</p> <p>Hopes that the Bank's range of measures would help improve liquidity in the money markets seemed premature, with overnight sterling libor - the rate at which banks lend to each other - virtually unchanged and overnight dollar libor jumping from 3.93% to 5.37%.</p> <p>In a rather staccato, but nonetheless accurate comment, Citigroup market strategist Adrian Cattley said:</p> <p>\"1907, 1929, 1973, 1987, 2008. This year's place in history is assured, no <br>doubt. October strikes again. Little confidence across markets. Trust is broken. Liquidity crisis, not yet a capital crisis. But, risk assets have taken a beating. Recession looks assured. Capital protection, first. Capital return, last.\"</p> <p>The banks turned in a mixed performance after the supposed rescue package. <strong>HBOS</strong> jumped 24.5% to 117p but potential purchaser <strong>Lloyds TSB</strong> lost 15.5p to 210p. <strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong> rose 0.7p to 90.7p but <strong>Barclays</strong> dropped 6.75p to 278.25p. <strong>Standard Chartered</strong>, partly because of Tuesday's overnight plunge in Asian markets, slid 151p to \u00a311.60.</p> <p>Elsewhere <strong>J.Sainsbury</strong> slumped 47p to 267.75p as entrepreneur Robert Tchenguiz disposed of 88m shares and 85m contracts for difference. There was some confusion initially as troubled Icelandic bank Kaupthing tried to place the shares at 250p each, before news came that its UK subsidiary Singer &amp; Friedlander had been placed into receivership. The deal eventually got done, but apparently not by Kaupthing.</p> <p>Late yesterday Kaupthing sold Tchenguiz's stake in <strong>Mitchells &amp; Butlers</strong>, down 8.5p at 155p, to billionaire investor oe Lewis.</p> <p>Sports retailer <strong>JJB</strong> - which recently unveiled a \u00a320m bridging loan from Kaupthing - lost 7p to 12p.</p> <p>Miners were again in the vanguard of the selling, as metals such as copper continued to drop on worries about falling demand.</p> <p><strong>Vedanta Resources</strong> dropped 141p to 864p, <strong>Kazakhmys</strong> closed 48.25p to 365.25p and <strong>BHP Billiton</strong> lost 114.5p to 972.5p.</p> <p>Analyst John Meyer at Fairfax said: \"Even renewed demand out of China will not be sufficient to arrest the fall in commodity markets with this form of equity led pressure. The inevitable reduction in global economic growth forecasts will reduce expectations for demand and prompt further selling of metals and other commodities.\"</p> <p>Anglo-Russian miner <strong>Aricom</strong> fell 13% to 14.75p as it confirmed it needed $1bn in new funds to finance an iron ore project designed to supply China.</p> <p>But some of the housebuilders bounced after the interest rate cuts. <strong>Bellway</strong> added 56.75p to 540p ahead of results next week, while <strong>Persimmon</strong> was up 28p at 400.75p. However <strong>Taylor Wimpey</strong> slipped 1.5p to 24p on continuing concern about the renegotiation of its banking covenants.</p> <p>Directories group <strong>Yell</strong> - which has just sorted out its covenants - added 10.5p to 109.75p, after Dresdner Kleinwort raised its price target from 112p to 163p.</p> <p>Dresdner said: \"Yell has bought itself breathing space by negotiating an additional 20% headroom on covenants in exchange for a one off fee of \u00a318m and a 1% point increase in interest charge or \u00a338m. This is a bargain given that a covenant breach next year looked impossible to avoid a few months ago and could have forced Yell into a debt for equity swap or rights issue with the bond markets effectively closed.</p> <p>\"We concede that ultimately, a rights issue is the only way to reduce leverage to an acceptable level to encourage marginal buyers. However, given that it is no longer imminent and frankly only plausible with the shares at higher levels, we would expect the short interest to continue to unwind.\"</p> <p>Lower down the market, restaurant group <strong>Prezzo l</strong>ost 8.5p to 23p as its directors decided to abandon a buyout due to the difficulties in raising finance.</p> <p>But <strong>Zenith Hygiene</strong> - which supplies toilet rolls and detergents - jumped 63% to 10p after saying it had received an approach which could lead to an offer at around 12p a share.</p>",
  "<p>World stockmarkets suffered another day of turmoil, the FTSE 100 slumping a further 5%, despite the Bank of England joining other world central banks today in a coordinated cut in interest rates designed to ward off the threat of global recession.</p> <p>The Bank, the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank all lopped half a point off their key interest rates in the first unscheduled rate moves since the aftermath of 9/11. Sweden, Canada and Switzerland made similar cuts. Australia reduced rates by a whole percentage point earlier this week.</p> <p>Expectations of coordinated action had been growing in recent days, as the global financial crisis worsened, giving rise to fears that it could tip the world economy into a deep and prolonged slump.</p> <p>There were sharp increases in European markets as the surprise announcements were made, but confidence quickly waned. The FTSE 100 index had plunged by as much as 360 points, or 7.8%, in early trading before rallying after the rate cuts. At 12.30pm it was slightly up but ended the day 5.2% lower, dropping 238.5 points to close at 4366.7. At 5.30pm, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had also traded to widl extremes, was down about 2.4%, 223 points lower at 9223.</p> <p>Threadneedle Street cut its bank rate to 4.5%, the Fed to 1.5% and the ECB to 3.75%. It marked the biggest cut by the Bank of England since November 2001, and takes rates here to their lowest for two years. The MPC has now abandoned its rate-setting meeting so there will be no announcement tomorrow.</p> <p>Simon Rubinsohn, chief economist at the Royal Insitution of Chartered Surveyors, said: \"The dramatic response from the authorities is an appropriate response to the chaos in financial markets over the past few weeks and the global economy's slide into recession. This should help to start the process of rebuilding confidence but we suspect that more action will be necessary over the coming months.\"</p> <p>Some economists have already said that the gravity of the crisis facing the British economy could see rates reduced to as low as 2.5%, which would be their lowest in over half a century.</p> <p>Miles Templeman, director-general of the IoD said: \"We welcome the coordinated monetary and fiscal response to the current crisis. However, we strongly believe that a further interest rate reduction of 50 basis points will be required next month, if not before.</p> <p>\"Inflation was yesterday's story, recession is today's story and deflation is tomorrow's risk. Interest rates are heading in one direction \u2013 down.\"</p> <p>The central banks made a joint statment saying: \"Inflationary pressures have started to moderate in a number of countries, partly reflecting a marked decline in energy and other commodity prices. Inflation expectations are diminishing and remain anchored to price stability. </p> <p>\"The recent intensification of the financial crisis has augmented the downside risks to growth and thus has diminished further the upside risks to price stability.\".</p> <p>The Bank of England said the monetary policy committee believed that inflation in the UK would soon peak at 5%, and then start to fall. \"Inflation is likely to rise further to above 5% in the next month or two, in large part as the full effects of already-announced increases in the price of domestic energy are felt. But inflation should then drop back, as the contribution from retail energy prices wanes, and the margin of spare capacity in the economy increases.\"</p> <p>The MPC said that cuts in interest rates alone \"could not be expected to resolve the current problems in financial markets\" and that they welcomed the government's plan to recapitalise the major UK banks. </p> <p>Separately, the AA reported that petrol prices at the pump had fallen by 10p a litre since their high in July to an average of 109.4p a litre.</p>",

It may or may not work to help restore confidence and months will pass before voters know for sure.</p> <p>Combined with Alistair Darling's stablisation package it addessed the mood of mounting hysteria among the moneymen. </p> <p>Proof that the crisis has a lot of unwinding still to do came as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/vincentcable\">Vince Cable</a>, the shrewd LibDem spokesman, revealed that up to half London's 32 borough <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/oct/08/localgovernment.economy\">councils have rashly put big deposits in those Icelandic banks</a>.</p> <p>Yet in the Commons - and at his <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global/blog/2008/oct/08/gordonbrown.marketturmoil\">earlier press conference</a> - Brown was conspicuously careful to cover his political back by repeatedly stressing that the rescue package is not just about saving feckless bankers, it is about small business loans, mortgages, jobs and output in the real economy - where most Britons live.</p> <p>How dependent on such considerations will the Treasury's \u00a350bn worth of loans, on offer to help recapitalise stricken banks, be when the bankers produce their begging bowls and detailed negotiations start?</p> <p>Officials in Whitehall keep stressing that this will be a commercial set of deals, with the taxpayers money protected by preferential shares and a premium on the interest rates.</p> <p>They cannot impose policies on banks with regard to small business, or for that matter on extravagant, short-term remuneration packages for executives who were thereby incentivised to take risks with the shareholders money - and pocket their bonuses before it all caught up with them.</p> <p>That is what enraged US voters on fabled Main St last month when the first outline of ex-Wall St Treasury secretary, Hank Paulson's, rescue package emerged.</p> <p>Since the US elections, Congressional as well as Presidential, are now less than a month away voters got their elected representatives attention without difficulty. </p> <p>From left and right it was attacked, as bailing out crooks or interfering socialism which will undermine markets. The stalemate was resolved through the usual pork barrel politics which permeated Capitol Hill. All sorts of local goodies were attached to the bill to square the rebels. That is how they do it there where Congress is independent of the executive branch - in the White House at the other end of Pennsylvannia Avenue - and holds the purse strings.</p> <p>But Brown must fear a similar voter backlash in Britain, encouraged by have-it-both-ways media commentary which slams ministers for dithering, then accuses them of a \"state grab\" when they put up a package which protects taxpayers by taking those shares. </p> <p>Most Labour MPs sounded grateful when they heard details today. Labour leftwingers have understandably rejoiced at the sight of nationalisations, their long discredited recipe for anything that moved. \" We've finally implemented the 1983 manifesto,\" quipped one veteran of Michael Foot's notorious defeat. They are - as ever - a minority.</p> <p>Yet older workers, who remember the battles over ageing British heavy industries which eventually died might ask \" why rescue the banks if the deep mined pits were allow to close?\"</p> <p>But today's nationalisations are not like Jim Callaghan's in the 70s, a response to structural problems - rigid labour unions with entrenched legal rights , under-investment ( the two were linked), weak and demoralised management, cheaper products competing from abroad, shortsighted shareholders.</p> <p>Despite getting huge sums of public money the Callaghan era's nationalisations - steel, ship building, cars, aerospace - mostly did not save those industries. They went into decline and disappeared; or were privatised and either thrived or died. Some have been rebuilt, cars for instance, under foreign ownership. Coal has recovered, albeit not the deep mines, as revenues dwindled from North Sea oil and gas, the big cheque in Thatcher's purse which financed her savage manufacturing restructuring. </p> <p>We can find energy sources in many places. Banks are central to the UK economy since the 80s, the financial sector worth close to 10% of the economy. The difference is that it cannot be allowed to fail. Just as the terms of debate have changed for coal (is it too dirty?) since the miners strike of 1983-84 which scarred Brown's rising generation it has for banks - and the voters expectations of cheap and plentiful credit during the boom decades.</p> <p>The changed public mood too, more assertive and individualistic, less patient, is also what Brown, his ministers and MPs, must grapple with. When the rising economies of Asia - India as well as China and its near neighbours - had surplus funds, the fruit of their export boom, to park, they put much of it into western banks. That fuelled the stock market, consumer and other bubbles. \"The West drowned in Asian liquidity,\" one Chinese banker recently explained.</p> <p>Explaining why much of that may now be at risk - to a public, loyal Labour voters among them, frightened for its jobs, its homes, its summer holidays and pensions pot - will not be easy for ministers. The crisis has given Brown the chance to get voters attention again after they had stopped listening. It forced him to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/oct/04/mandelson.gordonbrown\">embrace enemies like Peter Mandelson</a>, but the political crisis, like its economic cousin, still has a long way to unwind.</p>",
  "<p>The Salvation Army have signed a \u00a31m record deal with Universal after being branded \"the world's ultimate buskers\".</p> <p>The Christian charity normally associated with bringing salvation to the poor have already produced their first album, Together, due for release in November. And just to make sure this is just too much for you to take in at once, the organisation's International Staff band signed the record deal yesterday on London's Millennium Bridge. </p> <p>\"This is a really exciting project,\" the Army's Major David Hinton told the BBC. \"We hope it will not only raise money but will also help to raise awareness of the needs of the people with whom we work.\" Universal's Dickon Strainer, who signed the Salvation Army, called them the \"ultimate buskers\", adding: \"The sound of the Salvation Army gives comfort to people when times are tough, as they are now. \"We hope that this record will help expand the reach of their traditional fundraising.\"</p> <p>Referring to the credit crunch, Strainer said: \"At a time when lives are being turned upside down, people need something to rely on.\" The album will include covers of traditional religious songs as well as Nessun Dorma and Going Home (the Hovis theme).</p> <p>So there you have it, the global financial system may be crumbling around our ears but at least we'll have a brass rendition of Bleak Midwinter to raise our spirits.</p>",
  "<p>Barely a fortnight has passed since Japanese officials were savouring their country's apparent immunity to the financial crisis unfolding on the other side of the Pacific. As Wall Street floundered, it was left to Japan's banks, stung into less risky lending regimes by their own crisis of the 1990s, to swoop in and sweep up the debris.</p> <p>While it's true that Japan's financial institutions have avoided the credit losses that have sunk their once-revered US counterparts, the notion that the world's second biggest economy operates in a vacuum has been exposed this week as recklessly optimistic. Having teetered on the edge of meltdown for almost a week, the Nikkei plummeted almost 10% after a flurry of panic selling prompted by the crisis on Wall Street and the grim acceptance that the global economic malaise is about to go terminal.</p> <p>It was the Nikkei's largest drop in more than two decades, wiping US$250bn off the value of Japan Inc in the space of a few hours.</p> <p>It now looks possible that the world's second-biggest stock market will end the year down 40% \u2013 worse, even, than during the collapse of the economic bubble in the 1990s and the start of Japan's \"lost decade\".</p> <p>The relative health of its banks means Japan has so far avoided the bailout debate now being played out in cities across the developed world. Even so, there are plenty of other reasons why it needs to act quickly to avert its own economic shock. The omens are impossible to ignore. Consumer spending is down, business confidence is at its lowest level for nearly seven years and bankruptcies are creeping up.</p> <p>Japanese corporate icons face dwindling earnings as a result of the US credit squeeze and flat consumption at home: shares in Toyota, for instance, sank 12% today in their biggest drop for 21 years.</p> <p>While Nikkei's \"Black Wednesday\" begs questions about how Japan intends to chart a course through what threaten to be even more perilous economic waters, the answers are less forthcoming. For a clear indication of the crisis perception gap that has opened up between Washington and Tokyo, consider the mildly complacent tone of Japan's new prime minister, Taro Aso. Though he described the Nikkei nosedive as \"abnormal\" and agreed that the US disease was spreading, he went on: \"We must carefully monitor the situation and take appropriate action when needed.\" Hardly the kind of reassurance that will lull investors into a sound night's slumber.</p> <p>Tokyo's response so far has been limited to a 1.8tn yen stimulus package, conceived by Aso's predecessor as an antidote to rising fuel costs and now brutally exposed as the wrong answer to the wrong question.</p> <p>There are, of course, compelling domestic factors behind Tokyo's timidity. Not only must the Aso administration be seen to be acting to shore up the economy, it also faces an election that could see his party kicked out of office for only the second time in the past 53 years.</p> <p>It is reasonable to expect more of the same from Japan on the international stage. Even as the abject failure of unilateral government action becomes clearer by the day, Japan may be cajoled into acting more decisively when the G7 finance ministers and central bank chiefs meet to discuss a coordinated response to the funding crisis in Washington this weekend.</p> <p>While other G7 economies will receive a psychological boost from the announcement of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/08/marketturmoil.creditcrunch\">coordinated cut</a> in interest rates, Japan, where rates are already at an ultra-low 0.5%, has fewer weapons in its monetary arsenal than other industrialised nations. For now, domestic political factors and the distant, though white-hot, epicentre of the current crisis will probably confine Japan's response to grim-faced statements of concern and a spot of old-fashioned fiscal expansion.</p> <p>For its efforts, it has been accused of engaging in \"pantomime\". That's not far off the mark, but given the paucity of ideas, and the magnitude of the problem that confronts them, Japan's leaders are looking more like bit-part players in a global tragicomedy.</p>",
  "<p>The chief executive of HSBC broke ranks today and warned that the British government bailout of the banking system had set a \"bad precedent\".</p> <p>Michael Geoghegan was one of the few top level banking bosses absent from last night's marathon meeting with government officials, choosing instead to send a lower ranking executive.</p> <p>In an interview with Reuters this afternoon in Istanbul he admitted that the government had few options left after the tumultuous events of recent weeks but departed from the bland comments of welcome that even his own bank issued this morning.</p> <p>\"I sympathise with the British taxpayer,\" he said. \"I don't think it is right that the British taxpayer should need to bail out banks ... it sets a bad precedent, but the government had no alternative.\"</p> <p>Geoghegan said he expected \"light at the end of the tunnel\" of the credit crisis by 2010 or 2011. </p> <p>The HSBC chief executive, who was on a global roadshow, said regulators and governments were now working more closely for a coordinated response to the financial market crisis and the latest interest rate cut was helpful, but it would take time for consumer confidence to return. </p> <p>HSBC said it had no plans to use a UK government offer to recapitalise as it can generate enough capital internally. </p> <p>It has one of the strongest capital and liquidity positions of all banks and its shares have outperformed during the credit crisis as it is perceived as a safe haven. </p> <p>Its tier 1 capital ratio is 8.8% and it only lends 90% of what it holds in deposits.</p>",

  "<p>On the same day as it became apparent that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/07/royalbankofscotlandgroup.banking\">RBS would need billions of pounds</a> of taxpayers' money to save it from collapse, the government's climate change watchdog <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/oct/07/carbon.emissions.targets\">warned</a> that we should abandon almost all fossil fuel use for power generation by 2028. The investments that banks like RBS make are taking us to the edge of environmental catastrophe as well as market meltdown, and any regulation involved in the public bail-out of RBS and other banks must include environmental as well as financial stipulations.</p> <p>Although all the UK high street banks (with the honourable exception of the Co-op) are heavily involved in bankrolling new oilfields, gas pipelines and coal power stations around the world, RBS has been shown to have the worst track record of the lot. </p> <p>A report released last year <a href=\"http://peopleandplanet.org/navid3756\">showed</a> that the emissions embedded within RBS oil and gas project finance reached 36.9m tonnes of carbon in 2005 \u2013 equivalent to one-quarter of UK households, and almost as much as the entire emissions output of Scotland. In 2008, a subsequent report, <a href=\"http://www.enn.com/pollution/spotlight/37934\">Cashing in on Coal</a>, showed that in the preceding two years, RBS loaned an estimated $15.93bn in 27 different loans to coal-related companies around the world. These included RBS taking a share in massive loans worth $70bn to <a href=\"http://www.eon.com/\">Eon</a>, the energy giant <a href=\"http://www.eon-uk.com/generation/supercritical.aspx\">attempting</a> to build the first <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/kingsnorth\">coal-fired power station</a> in this country in 34 years.</p> <p>There's a real danger that the recent global economic turmoil will edge out mounting concerns over climate change, when it should really be encouraging a move towards more joined-up thinking towards the environment, money and the market. New forms of regulation shouldn't just be limited to the relatively cosmetic business of capping executive bonuses. They should cut to the heart of the climate damage being inflicted by RBS and other banks through their expansion of the fossil fuel frontier around the world. It's bad enough that Joe Public's savings have been used to bankroll this expansion: now their taxes could be as well.</p> <p>Any bail-out should be conditional upon RBS making a full disclosure of its fossil fuel financing, as well as making a commitment to immediately cap and reduce the carbon emissions embedded in its investments and loans. The transition to a low-carbon economy requires substantial investment, in renewable energy, public transport infrastructure and energy efficiency measures. Such investment needs to be made instead of, rather than alongside, financing new coal and oil. To date RBS has been taking a contradictory stance of crowing over its clean energy financing while disavowing itself from its fossil fuel involvement. Freed of the short-term profit interests that dictate the \"free\" market, banks could play a huge role in allocating capital towards the massive overhaul that the global economy needs.</p> <p>We cannot address the current financial crisis without simultaneously addressing the issues of climate change and our ongoing dependence on dwindling supplies of fossil fuels. For the first time in living memory, the government has the potential to have a direct say in the lending behaviour of banks like RBS, and that opportunity should be used to take us down the path of climate as well as economic stability.</p>",

  "<p>It has to be the right thing to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/oct/08/marketturmoil.creditcrunch\">cut interest rates</a> as the global economy looks dangerously close to coming off the rails. Anything less than 0.5% would have left critics demanding the head of the Bank of England governor, Mervyn King, who has been accused, by some, of doing too little, too late. </p> <p>What was particularly gratifying about today's cut was that it represented a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/oct/08/interestrates.banking\">coordinated response</a>, with similar cuts announced by the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank. </p> <p>As it becomes increasingly clear that the world economy faces a very sharp downturn, a global response to the financial crisis is essential and we can only hope that when the dust settles, that international rules are drawn up to regulate banks, derivatives, hedge funds and everything else that got us into this appalling financial mess in the first place.</p> <p>But just as I questioned whether Alistair Darling's bank bail-out plan would work, so too must I inject a note of caution about interest rate cuts. Without doubt they are helpful and will bolster confidence, but they are not a panacea. The banks need more capital, so credit will not be in plentiful supply as it once was for a very long time. </p> <p>But there are hopeful signs: after the Bank of England's announcement, several large mortgage lenders trimmed their variable rates. So perhaps the bail-out plan, agreed by ministers on the basis that banks show a willingness to start lending again, is bearing fruit. Fingers crossed</p>",
  "<p>London's stockmarket was back in the red this afternoon after a brief rally sparked by a round of coordinated emergency half-point cuts in interest rates from major central banks including the Bank of England, the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank.</p> <p>The FTSE 100, which plunged by almost 360 points, or 7.8%, in early trading, rocketed into positive territory after the shock rate move, which is the Bank of England's first emergency rate cut since the aftermath of 9/11. But by mid-afternoon the index was down by 158 points at 4446 points, a fall of 3.5%.</p> <p>On Wall Street, the Dow Jones initially dropped more than 200 points, but later the index was up 44 points at 9491.</p> <p>The Bank of England reduced its base rate to 4.5% from 5% while the ECB lowered its main rate to 3.75% from 4.25%. The Fed lowered its key federal funds rate to 1.5% and its discount rate to 1.75%. The Canadian, Swiss and Swedish central banks also cut their interest rates.</p> <p>Stockmarkets slumped this morning in reaction to the deepening <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/creditcrunch\">financial crisis</a> and despite the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/08/creditcrunch.banking\">UK government unveiling a major bail-out package</a> for the British banking sector.</p> <p>The FTSE 100 was dragged down by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2008/oct/08/banks.jsainsbury\">sharp falls in most banking shares</a> and mining companies. HBOS, which is being taken over by Lloyds TSB, was initially the only major bank to rise but later Royal Bank of Scotland also recovered. Shares in retailers including J Sainsbury also crashed, with the high street hit by major cutbacks in consumer spending as a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/08/manufacturing.creditcrunch\">recession looms</a>.</p> <p>Alistair Darling, the chancellor, unveiled the details of a long-awaited emergency banking package before the London market opened this morning. It includes the government spending \u00a350bn to part-nationalise Britain's biggest banks, in a dramatic attempt to stop the country's financial system melting down.</p> <p>The UK package, which came on top of a $700bn US bail-out plan, a string of bank rescues and central banks pumping billions into the financial system have done little to ease fears that the current crisis still has a long way to run and is pushing large parts of the world into recession.</p> <p>The International Monetary Fund today cut its global growth forecasts in its half-yearly health-check of the international economy. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/08/recession.globaleconomy\">Britain will suffer its first full year of recession since 1991 next year, the IMF predicted</a>.</p> <p>All eyes are now on the Group of Seven finance ministers and central bank heads, who are due to discuss a concerted response to the crisis in Washington on Friday.</p> <p>European shares pared losses after the interest rate cuts. Earlier this morning, the German DAX plunged 408 points to 4918, the French CAC was 305 points lower at 3426, while the Swiss market fell 339 points to 6088.</p> <p>The US Federal Reserve chairman, Ben Bernanke, did little to reassure markets yesterday when he said the US economy was being battered by a financial crisis of \"historic dimension\". Fears over the worsening global crisis drove <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/08/marketturmoil.japan\">Asian markets sharply lower</a>. Japan's Nikkei dropped by 9.4%, its biggest one-day decline since the 1987 stockmarket crash. The Indonesian stockmarkets were suspended indefinitely after its benchmark index plunged more than 10%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng slumped 8.2% to 15431.</p> <p>\"Amid deepening uncertainty over the course of the financial crisis and worries over a slowdown in the global economy, investors simply don't find incentives to buy stocks,\" said Kabuki Miyazawa, a market analyst at Daiwa Securities SMBC. \"Selling seems almost unstoppable because of uncertainty over the crisis.\" </p> <p>In Paris, trading was suspended for 15 minutes at 10.15am local time after France's main share index fell 8.18% to its lowest level since December 2003. The 15-minute rule applies when 35% of the stock exchange's market capitalisation is indicated limit-down, a spokeswoman for exchange operator NYSE-Euronext told Reuters. </p> <p>In the Middle East, the Egyptian stock exchange suffered a fall of more than 16%. </p> <p>The price of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/08/commodities.marketturmoil\">gold</a> - regarded as a safe haven investment in turbulent times - rose by nearly 3%. Silver prices jumped almost 5%, tracking gold.<br></p>",
  "<p>For a century or more, the political left in Britain has said there will be no fundamental change until the state controls the financial sector; that, up to a point, is what happened today. Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling have done what their Labour forbears could only dream of doing: they have socialised the City.</p> <p>Some may be tempted to think, judging by the total horlicks they have made of things in recent days, that the prime minister and chancellor are sleepers who have spent their lives burrowing deep into the system simply to emerge when the time is ripe with a revolutionary blueprint.</p> <p>Let's be clear. Alistair Darling and Gordon Brown have taken this momentous step not out of conviction but out of dire necessity. Britain's financial system was on the point of meltdown on Tuesday night, with potentially catastrophic effects for the economy.</p> <p>This is not the case, although one way of looking at the dawn announcement that the Treasury will inject \u00a350bn into the banks and another \u00a3250bn lubricating the wholesale money markets is that the class war is over and the good guys won.</p> <p>In reality, it's far too soon to say that. The government may choose to run the big high street banks so that the worst excesses of recent years - the absurd risks, the unwarranted salaries, the short-termist approach to investment - are reined in. But it may not. Today's statement signalled an intent to clamp down on the pay and bonus structures at the banks, but there was no suggestion that the Treasury would use its financial clout to influence the way institutions are run.</p> <p>Some caution is justified. When the French government nationalised Cr\u00e9dit Lyonais, the opposite applied, with the people running the bank believing the state guarantee gave them the security to take ridiculous gambles with taxpayers' money, including buying a Hollywood film studio, with predictably disastrous results.</p> <p>Everything the government has said since it was forced, reluctantly, to take over Northern Rock in February, suggests that it wants to take a back-seat role.</p> <p>This, though, may be more difficult than Darling believes. The financial crisis will not be brought to an end by today's move, dramatic though it was. Despite today's half-point cut in interest rates, Britain is in the early stages of a deep and painful recession that will further sap the strength of the banks.</p> <p>Indeed, it is still unclear whether the chancellor and his team fully comprehend the <em>fin de siecle</em> nature of what has happened over the past month. There are four big conclusions.</p> <p>In ascending order of importance, the first is that the long period of economic expansion that started in September 1992 with the pound's forced departure from the European exchange rate mechanism is now over. The IMF warned today that Britain's economy will shrink next year for the first time in 18 years, with a risk that the forecast 0.1% decline in GDP will be over-optimistic. The way things look, that's a reasonable call.</p> <p>The second thing that bit the dust today was the notion that the British economy could survive on finance alone. For the past 20 years, policy makers in the UK have convinced themselves that the might of the City could compensate for the country's inability to make anything. The notion that the ever-widening trade deficit was merely a temporary phase while Britain adjusted to a weightless, virtual, financially-driven future has now exposed for the grotesque fantasy it always was.</p> <p><strong>Obeisance to big capital</strong></p> <p>Thirdly, the bankruptcy of the City also represents the bankruptcy of New Labour economics, which has been based to an unhealthy degree on a desire to ape the go-getting, deal-making culture of the United States. Labour governments of the past have always had industrial strategies, which have normally been based on the idea that manufacturing matters. Since 1997, ministers have convinced themselves that Britain has a comparative advantage in financial services and that therefore industrial policy should be based on giving the City what it wants. </p> <p>The light-touch regulation of financial services was but one expression of the almost total obeisance to big capital. Manufacturing industry, by contrast, was allowed to wither on the vine, even though the idea that developed Western nations can no longer compete industrially with the emerging nations of East Asia is countered by the remarkably good performance of high-cost European countries such as Germany and Sweden. Britain would be a cleaner and more prosperous country had a fraction of the effort spent on making London safe for speculators been reallocated to harnessing the nation's undoubted raw scientific talent into a thriving environmental technology industry.</p> <p>Finally, the dominance of the City is now over, at least for the time being. What we have seen over the past 14 months is the humbling of the City; what the Greeks would have called nemesis following hubris. Far from using their freedom from regulation to take wise decisions that would benefit all, banks plunged into investments about which they knew little or nothing. Far from allocating capital in an efficient manner, the credit crunch that has resulted from the orgy of irresponsible lending has led to a dearth of funds for the small businesses that sorely need it. </p> <p>What we have seen in the first week of October in 2008 is a broken-backed industry that promised to be at the cutting edge of the free market but in reality cannot survive without the largesse of the state. When it came to it, all the bastions of deregulation - the City, the CBI, the Conservative party - crumbled because they could see the writing on the wall. Without funding from the taxpayer, virtually no bank would be safe from the virus that has infected the global financial system.</p> <p>Peter Dixon, chief UK economist at Commerzbank put it succinctly when he said the plan \"represents an enormous 'volte face' from a government which has set great store by a light touch approach to financial regulation over the past decade. The political consequences will be massive. If ever an indication were needed that the Anglo Saxon capitalist model were in trouble, a government bail out to the UK banking sector provides it in spades.\"</p> <p>Although Alistair Darling and Gordon Brown would never have wanted it this way, they now have the commanding heights of the economy in their hands. The interesting question is what they will do with this unexpected power.</p>",
  "<p>Housebuilders' shares are having something of a relief rally, following the coordinated central bank action to knock 50 basis points off interest rates.</p> <p>Top of the pile at the moment is <strong>Bellway</strong>, up 16% to 561.5p ahead of its full-year results due next Tuesday.</p> <p>Mark Hughes at Panmure Gordon picks Bellway as the best of the housebuilding bunch. He says in a note today: \"Bellway should demonstrate a degree of outperformance relative to its peers when it reports on the past 12 months on Tuesday. Therefore, whilst we have sell recommendations on all of the company's peers at present, ahead of Bellway's results we retain our hold recommendation.</p> <p>\"We do not expect widespread asset writedowns at this point. Although <br>given the market has eroded further since the last trading statement in August, writedowns will likely be larger than the company was anticipating just two months ago. </p> <p>\"Bellway has relatively low gearing at around 23%; this is a key positive <br>for the company. It is operating well within its facilities at present. We see peak gearing as 41% in 2011. This is after our writedown assumptions, which equate to \u00a3180m over three years. Importantly, we are not factoring in any rights issues or debt for equity swaps on Bellway.\"</p> <p>In the rest of the sector, <strong>Persimmon</strong> is up 41.5p at 414.25p while <strong>Taylor Wimpey</strong> has climbed 2p to 27.5p.</p> <p>Overall, the initial euphoria following the rate cuts has evaporated somewhat, especially with predictions that Wall Street would open more than 200 points lower after its 508-point decline yesterday.</p> <p>In the event the Dow Jones Industrial Average did open sharply lower but - in keeping with the seemingly never ending global volatility - it is now around 90 points higher.</p> <p>So the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> - having been down 211 points as the Dow opened, is now off 117 points at 4488.2.</p> <p><strong>HBOS</strong> is still holding most of its gains, up 38.8p at 132.8p, and <strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong> is up 10p at 100p.</p> <p>Back with <strong>J.Sainsbury</strong>, it is now 52.75p lower at 262p on news that Kaupthing is placing 168m shares at 250p each, representing entrepreneur Robert Tchenguiz's stake.</p> <p>Analyst Sam Hart at Charles Stanley said: \"There are few obvious potential buyers for the entire 10% stake, creating the threat of a stock overhang. The Qatar Investment Authority already holds 27%, so the acquisition of more than a further 3% would oblige it to make a full bid, which seems unlikely in the current financial environment.\"</p>",

  "<p>Steve Toltz is jetlagged, and he looks it. Rumpled hair, half-open eyes, and the occasional inability to find the right vocabulary all bear testament to the rigours of the Australia-to-London flight he took yesterday, in order to make it to the UK in time for next week's Booker circus.</p> <p>He doesn't seem particularly well prepared for the media attention coming his way, and makes a song and dance over reading an extract from the book, variously standing up and down, cricking his back, rushing to the loo and fumbling over words.</p> <p>\"Look, until I finished the book I'd never been to a book reading and I never quite understood it, it seemed a bit odd to me why you'd want to hear an author reading his book,\" he says. \"I have not read out loud to anyone over the age of five, ever, so just thought it was a bit odd.\"</p> <p>Toltz is uncomfortable with the idea of nationality, so he probably wouldn't want to hear that he is your typical Antipodean traveller, laid back, scruffy, lethargic and prone to beginning a lot of sentences with \"Look\". Yes, he's excited to be shortlisted for the Booker but on this sunny Tuesday the 36-year-old not exactly animated about it. \"Look, it's funny,\" he says. \"There is an element of arbitrariness about it, only because you know that in a different year five different judges would pick six different books.\" </p> <p>One does also wonder how pleased he is to be generating the press interest, since journalists are described in the book as maggots, grubby parasites, cannibalistic. In fact, he says, the genesis of the book was his fascination with people who are torn apart by the media, but he reassures me that it's never happened to him and he bears no particular grudges. \"Every nation needs somebody to hate at any different time,\" he says, \"but what if you looked up and it was your dad, and the papers were saying your dad is the biggest scumbag in the country \u2013 that's what got me started.\"</p> <p>Thanks to a thwarted plan to make everyone in Australia a millionaire, this is what happens to A Fraction of the Whole's Martin Dean, and by extension to his son Jasper \u2013 but it's a long and circuitous route they follow to get there. Toltz, like the wonderfully bad-tempered misanthrope Martin, is extravagant in his invention; the 700-odd pages of the novel are stuffed with mad creations - a house surrounded by a labyrinth, a democratic cooperative of crime, one character's useful Handbook of Crime (Sample chapter headings: Crime and Fashion: Balaclavas Are Always In, and Motiveless Crimes - Why?)</p> <p>Chair of the Booker judges Michael Portillo described it as a \"very Australian book, wonderfully irreverent\", and Toltz will admit that it is concerned with two very Australian preoccupations \u2013 sport and criminals. \"Look, a lot of these things are things I just noticed about Australia and nobody seemed to be really talking about them. You know when you see something on television and look around the room and think 'is nobody else hearing this?' So a lot of it is about Australia, about their obsession with sport, obsession with criminals - I just thought I'd fuse the two together.\" Hence the character Terry Dean, who wins national treasure status for a killing spree attempting to stamp out corruption in sport.</p> <p>It might be a brick of a book today but A Fraction of the Whole actually began as two short stories that Toltz couldn't bear to stop working on. \"I thought 'that story looks like the beginning of something, that one looks like the end of something. Now I just have to string them together'. Except the middle took a bit longer than I'd anticipated,\" he says. \"Look, I knew where I was going but I didn't know how to get there. I knew the end point, it was just the middle point, to actually get to that point, that was really, I won't say out of control, but it was a surprise for me. If I knew a story page by page before I started writing it I just wouldn't do it. The process of discovery is really important for my own enjoyment.\"</p> <p>It took him five years and extensive revisions to complete the book, working his way around the world in a more or less random series of jobs, from telemarketer to data entry clerk, private investigator (not as interesting as it sounds, he says), cameraman and film extra. \"I knew I was working on this and didn't want to have a fallback career - for fear of falling back on it,\" he says. \"I'm not sure if I always wanted to be a writer, but I was always writing \u2026 I actually went into writing first to supplement my income, which was a strange thing to do and actually failed. So if a short story competition came up I would enter that, or a radio competition \u2013 it was my default hobby. So I just kept doing that, and eventually realised when people would ask 'what do you do?', I'd be 'I'm a writer', because that's the only thing I was doing.\"</p> <p>Toltz studied video production at university in Australia, but was horrified to discover he'd got to the end of his degree without reading a book. \"I thought I'd squandered my education, I got into a panic about it. So I went to the university of New South Wales, went to the Russian literature department, said 'give me a reading list', and started working my way through it.\" </p> <p>Like his protagonists Jasper and Martin, Toltz has gone on to steep himself in literature, and finds the authors he's been reading have a tendency to pop up in his own writing. \"If I read someone with a very strong voice and find it creeping into my work, that's a pleasure too. I can read parts [of A Fraction of the Whole] and think 'that's the bit I wrote while reading Raymond Chandler.'\" He also cites Louis-Ferdinand Celine, Knut Hamsun and John Fante as influences.</p> <p>The world travel, upping sticks regularly with his French wife, also fed into the writing, he thinks. \"The mind reboots every time, for me, in a new environment. You look at things slightly differently, it's fresher, it opens the door a little bit more.\" </p> <p>Relative poverty seems to have been quite useful, too. When he was teaching English, and writing his novel, in Spain, he lived in a room with no electricity for a year. \"When you take out bills, rent, phone, electricity, gas, internet, mobile phone bills and you only need to eat and drink, it does give you a lot more space.\"</p> <p>His roaming soul means Toltz is back on the road \u2013 Bondi Beach was home for a while, but after the Booker is over and done with, he's off to France for a couple of months, and then who knows where. \"We're back to living out of a suitcase,\" he says. \"It's good while we can.\" He'll be working on his second novel, of which he's unwilling to say much as he's sure it will go through \"28 epiphanies\" before it's done, but admits he's just discovered Chilean writer Roberto Bola\u00f1o, \"and that's feeling like an influence\".</p> <p>And his hopes for the Booker? \"I honestly think my chances are one in six,\" he deadpans. \"I've started going through [the other shortlisted] books and reading them - so far so good. I feel I'm in good company, and I will be pleased if I lose to a book I really like.\"</p>",

He tells the tearful woman that she works too much and is \"not the same person I fell in love with\".</p> <p>In a dreamlike sequence, a young Aboriginal boy, Brandon Walters - who features in the movie - appears and tells the woman to \"go walkabout\" and find herself.

  "<p>Britain will suffer its first full year of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/recession\">recession</a> since 1991 next year as the global economy enters a \"major downturn\" triggered by the most dangerous financial shock since the 1930s, the IMF said today.</p> <p>In a sombre half-yearly health-check of the international economy, the International Monetary Fund slashed its growth forecasts for the UK for 2009 from 1.7% to -0.1% \u2013 more sharply than for any other major economy.</p> <p>The IMF said the risk was that the recession in the UK would be even deeper than it is currently forecasting.</p> <p>Overall, the IMF said the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/globaleconomy\">world economy</a> would grow by just 3% in 2009, largely due to the strength of the two big developing Asian economies, China and India, which are forecast to expand by 9.3% and 6.9% respectively.</p> <p>\"The major advanced economies are already in, or close to recession, and although a recovery is projected in 2009, the pickup is likely to be unusually gradual, held back by continued financial market deleveraging,\" the IMF said in its World Economic Outlook, released as finance ministers from around the world prepare to gather in Washington this weekend to discuss the crisis.</p> <p>\"The financial crisis that first erupted with the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/subprimecrisis\">US sub-prime mortgage collapse</a> in 2007 has deepened further in the past six months, and entered a tumultuous new phase in September,\" the fund warned.</p> <p>\"The impact has been felt across the global financial system, including in emerging markets to an increasing extent. Intensifying solvency concerns have led to emergency resolutions of major US and European financial institutions, and have badly shaken confidence.\"</p> <p>Of the developed economies, the US is expected to flirt with an outright recession in 2009, growing by a sickly 0.1%, while the world's second-biggest economy, Japan, should see 0.5% growth, with Germany stagnating, the fund said.</p> <p>The fund singled out the UK, together with Ireland and Spain, as especially vulnerable to a housing market crash, saying it has experienced a larger \"unexplained\" increase in house prices over the past decade. It added that the Treasury is entering the downturn with the public finances in a weaker state than at the time of the dotcom collapse, leaving Alistair Darling less scope to use fiscal policy to prop up the economy.</p> <p>Analysing the causes of the financial crisis, the fund said \"lax macroeconomic and regulatory policies\" had allowed the world economy to grow faster than its \"speed limit\", for several years, allowing bubbles to build up in stockmarkets, house prices and commodities.</p> <p>It called for central banks to be allowed to take into account the risk of financial instability in their monetary policy decisions, and lean against the wind\" to prevent unsustainable booms from emerging in future.</p>",
  "<p>It's started, and not from one of the usual anti-league suspects. So hats off to Mr Bruce Jones of Chester for being first cab off the rank in dismissing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/rugbyleagueworldcup2008\">rugby league's 13th World Cup</a> more than a fortnight before the first tackle.<br> In the sports letters section of this morning's Guardian, Mr Jones asserts that the competition \"promises to be the most pointless international sporting event in recent history\". \"This is a sport played in New South Wales, Queensland, pockets of the north of England and by New Zealanders who are no good at rugby union,\" he continues, originally. That's the usual line of attack, and no-one in league is pretending that the code has been as globally successful as union, or that any nation other than Australia, England or those Kiwi rugby rejects \u2013 and what a casually offensive comment that is to generations of great sportsmen, from George Smith to Ruben Wiki \u2013 has a realistic chance of winning the competition. Compare that to the fantastically competitive Rugby (sic) World Cup, which has featured, er, five teams with a realistic chance of winning since it was introduced in 1987 \u2013 33 years after the league version. Still a significant 67% better than league can manage, admittedly, but that still leaves a much bigger gap between union and truly global sports such as football, than the one that exists between union and league. Mr Jones also refers to the blatantly contrived \"draw\" for this league World Cup, in which the big three will spend the first three weeks of the tournament jostling for position and almost certainly knocking out Papua New Guinea \u2013 a country whose league obsession is disrespectfully ignored in his letter. He's touched a nerve here, as there is deep unease about the draw, and specifically its treatment of the plucky and popular Kumuls, within rugby league circles. But there is some method to what initially appears to be madness, as the competition will be guaranteed one heavyweight match each weekend, which was necessary to bring in enough money from Australian television to avoid the damaging financial losses of the 2000 World Cup in Europe. In contrast this one is already guaranteed to make money, which will hopefully nurture the seeds of international development that have been planted in the last couple of decades in such unlikely-sounding places as Jamaica, Serbia, the Czech Republic and Lebanon. And at least there should be no danger of the huge mismatches which have marred the last couple of World Cups in the other code as their pool stages have dragged on interminably, at least to non-zealots. For a league fan, which presumably Mr Clark is not, each of the six matches in England's pool, and for that matter the other six from the remaining two pools of three teams \u2013 Samoa, Tonga and Ireland, and Fiji, France and Scotland \u2013 holds its own appeal. Sure, a sport like league may not be truly global, but isn't it allowed to celebrate the recent revival of the game in France through the Catalans Dragons, or to give passionate Pacific islanders the chance to represent their ancestry? The battles between France and Fiji in Rockhampton, and Tonga and Samoa in Penrith, to join the big three in the semi-finals could provide some of the most enduring memories of this World Cup. You'll probably have noticed that I haven't concentrated on Ireland or Scotland yet, and it is here that I do concede that league is on the dodgiest ground. The fact that Ireland's squad was named yesterday not in Dublin but in Leeds, at the base of their main sponsors Carnegie, reflects an undeniable lack of authenticity about their World Cup side, and it's a similar story for the Scots. Yet even here, it is unfair to be too condescending about the adventure on which their players are about to embark. They're not doing it for the money \u2013 I gather the Irish lads are on \u00a3100 per win should they overcome the daunting physical challenges that will be presented by Tonga and Samoa, and they'll be flying economy class out of Manchester on Monday while the England boys turn left and climb the stairs into business. A conversation with any of the Ireland players \u2013 from Stevie Gibbons, a town planning student from Carlow who spent the 2008 season with the London Skolars, to Karl Fitzpatrick, the Salford full-back who is from the substantial Irish community in Wigan \u2013 leaves no doubt about their commitment to the cause. Whether it will ever lead to any top-level rugby league being played in Ireland must remain in doubt, despite the modestly encouraging progress that's been made since Carnegie put some money into an amateur league earlier this year. But I'd have thought the natural inclination of sports lovers in Ireland would be to support these lads rather than mock them, and the same would presumably go for the Scots, despite a few predictably sniffy comments from journalists north of the border. So, Mr Clark, and the various cynics who I'd guess are now sharpening their pens, you may think it's pointless, but for quite a few of us \u2013 some of them even outside those pockets of northern England to which you refer - it promises to be a thoroughly enjoyable month. And yes, I know, there's really no need to react to such nonsense, but I thought I'd get it out of the way early doors, then maybe we can enjoy the sport for its own sake rather than spend the next fortnight being forced to defend it.</p>",
  "<p>These are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/30/wallstreet.marketturmoil1\">bleak times</a> and the climate of economic uncertainty is certainly not doing wonders for our morale. Some businesses, however, are benefiting from this unfortunate set of circumstances and probably welcome our economic demise with a big (if possibly guilty) smile. </p> <p>We hear that sewing machine manufacturers are <a href=\"http://lifeandhealth.theguardian.com/fashion/story/0,,2276537,00.html\">making profits</a> as people learn to mend clothes rather than buy new ones, while home-made crafts are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/apr/28/sewwhat\">more popular than ever</a> (and save money at Christmas).

What other businesses do you think could profit from the global economic crisis?</p>",
  "<p>There was a moment on the radio this morning when a BBC reporter asked John Cridland, No 2 at the CBI how well he thought the government had done. </p> <p>\"I can't criticise the government. The pace of events...\" replied Cridland. \"You think the government has done a good job?\" interrupted the reporter, a touch incredulous. </p> <p>Cridland, whose organisation was on the saner side of free market argument in the Thatcher heyday, said the CBI is \"very grateful\" for government support. </p> <p>That's nice because we're all going to have to pay for it one way or another - and it will be a long time before anyone can know whether the remedy has worked to restore confidence in financial markets and beyond.</p> <p>But everyone wants instant answers. \"Banks furious as government dithers\" were headlines in yesterday's papers, this because Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling hadn't come up with the rescue package for the banks which they explicitly said - at the weekend and on Monday - they weren't yet ready to produce. Having listened to officials this morning, explaining the grinding technicalities after being up all night I have some sympathy.</p> <p>Yet , just as today's Daily Mail leads on \"Banks to fall under state control\" - sinister or what? - we heard John Humphrys, the Mail's broadcasting favourite, cajoling Darling on the Today programme about his apparent refusal to take more control of the banks to protect the taxpayers' interests.</p> <p>You just can't win. Damned if you do, damned if you don't, damned if you hurry - like Hank Paulson in the US - damned if you sew up the details - as Darling has tried to do - rather than go off at half-cock.</p> <p>Before addressing MPs at lunchtime the chancellor refused to answer questions he didn't want to answer - quite right too in tricky times when casual words can tumble markets, though it transpires that each negotiation with each bank will be different, depending what they ask for and what assurances - executive pay, share status etc - Whitehall seeks to protect the taxpayer.</p> <p>That all seems reasonable to me. Indeed at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2008/oct/08/pmqs.gordonbrown\">PM's question time</a> - a rare win in straight sets for Brown - David Cameron and Nick Clegg were falling over themselves to ask largely redundant questions about the need to look after small businesses and mortgage victims, not the bonuses of investment bankers who have failed us all. </p> <p>Easy, populist stuff from Cameron and George Osborne, who were singing more of a John McCain tune a few days ago.</p> <p>But what about that earlier \"banks furious\"? Where did all that stuff come from? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/08/economy.gordonbrown\">Patrick Wintour sets out some of the background in today's Guardian</a>, not least the pressure on Downing Street after City leaks helped push down bank shares and the FTSE in general - though it was part of a global decline on Monday and Tuesday. It seems to have emerged from weekend briefings and meetings between interested parties.</p> <p>Brown blames the Tories for leaking confidential briefings for party advantage. That may or may not be the case. But what triggered Tuesday's market panic was <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/robertpeston/ \">Robert Peston's BBC blog</a>, revealing a Monday night meeting where the \"gang of three\" - Barclays, RBS and Lloyds TSB - told Darling to pull his finger out and rescue them fast. </p> <p>That could be a case of briefing against government to increase political pressure, something the City is good at doing against ministers and against commercial rivals. </p> <p>There again, if other banks - less pressed - were present they could have leaked it to damage the gang of three. Who can say? Peston, who is a very good news reporter, has been scaring me for months. \"He behaves like a print journalist,\" complains a tabloid colleague. </p> <p>Exactly, but the BBC is not a tabloid and the impact of its bulletins - and blogs - is exponential in a febrile public mood where City rumours easily go mad. </p> <p>The BBC bureaucracy is hopeless - think Andrew Gilligan - at managing the output of talented and energetic mavericks. </p> <p>The Mail is now on Robert Peston's case, so the suits may finally notice. Yet the temptation is always to hit the easy target - governments. Even so sophisticated a conservative commentator as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/08/economy.alistairdarling\">Simon Jenkins falls into this trap today</a>.</p> <p>So repeat after me: the bankers took the bumpers and the airbags out of the car to make it go faster. They then took it for a spin after a good lunch, drove too fast round some wet corners and crashed. They're in the wreckage screaming for help and blaming the fire brigade for not cutting them out sooner. They know the petrol tank may blow at any moment. In that situation it might be wise to extinguish that comforting cigar.</p>",
  "<p>When I was growing up it was <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-a-jqgiNpI\">Bob Holness</a> and <a href=\"http://www.radioacademy.org.uk/record.jsp?type=celeb&amp;ID=8\">Douglas Cameron</a>. Then came the likes of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2002/dec/04/radio.broadcasting\">Michael Parkinson and Angela Rippon</a>, and now its star presenters include an ex-London mayor and two former contestants on the Apprentice. Welcome to London talk station LBC, <a href=\"http://www.lbc.co.uk/\">35 years old today</a>. </p> <p>I was something on an LBC addict in my youth. Holness and Cameron on breakfast, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Hayes_(broadcaster)\">Brian Hayes'</a> essential morning show and the all-important late-night phones which sent me gently to sleep. And before you ask, no, I wasn't overburdened with friends at that time. </p> <p>The Sunday night mystery voice competition was particularly exciting, hosted \u2013 unless my memory is playing tricks on me \u2013 by one <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/jan/30/television.itv\">Jeremy Beadle</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-812825-details/Where+it+all+went+wrong+for+LBC/article.do\">But then it all went horribly wrong.</a> In 1989 its then owner, Crown Communications, had the bright idea of splitting the station in two \u2013 Crown FM and London Talkback.</p> <p>Crown FM was deeply boring \u2013 no jingles, no phone-ins, no fun \u2013 while London Talkback did what it said on the tin \u2013 phone-in, after phone-in, after phone-in. A bit like BBC Radio 5 Live today. I jest, of course.</p> <p>But it didn't have enough talent \u2013 or money, probably \u2013 to go round, and I retuned to Capital. One of London's great brands had been lost for good.</p> <p>Attempts to revive it with big name signings like Parky just didn't work. The venerable chatshow host sounded a lot more comfy talking to big name stars than he did Dave from Dagenham or John from <a href=\"http://www.bexley.gov.uk/\">Bexley</a>. </p> <p>I remember one time a chap started talking about dirty toilet bowls. Parkinson sounded appalled.</p> <p>I never did get on air. The only time I correctly guessed Beadle's mystery voice, the phone was permanently engaged. I have no doubt, in the light of recent events, that it was all entirely above board. </p> <p>A long list of relaunches and ownership changes followed, with its then largest shareholder ITN taking editorial control of both stations in 1999. Two years later, with the station still split in two, the services were swapped, with the more popular station given the superior FM berth, and the news service saddled with AM.</p> <p>In the latest official listening figures for the second quarter of this year, it had a total UK audience of 845,000 listeners, with 597,000 people tuning into LBC 97.3 \u2013 a 2.7% share of the audience \u2013 and 291,000 listening to LBC News 1152.</p> <p>The phone-in station, renowned as the favourite of London cab drivers everywhere, is up on five years ago, when it had 517,000 listeners, but the news service is down from 444,000. </p> <p>Some of the old voices I used to listen to are still there under its current owner <a href=\"http://www.thisisglobal.com/radio/\">Global Radio</a> \u2013 Steve Allen, Clive Bull \u2013 along with breakfast host Nick Ferrari and the likes of James O'Brien, Ken Livingstone, James Whale and former Apprentice contestants James Max and Tre Azam.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.lbc.co.uk/page-3411\">It is a curious mix</a>, along with one-off events such as the University Boat Race, poached from BBC Radio along with commentator Barry Davies. </p> <p>If you liked Holness and Cameron at breakfast then you probably won't like Ferrari \u2013 I don't \u2013 and I only tune in very rarely these days. Do you? I would also like to hear your favourite LBC memories. After 35 years, there are certainly plenty to choose from.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Peter Boockvar</strong>, equity strategist at <strong>Miller Tabak &amp; Co</strong>, said that the interest rate cuts showed that global central banks are doing everything they can to stem the financial crisis. \"This was another piece of that puzzle. We knew that the Fed funds was pricing in a rate cut,\" he said. \"I guess a shock and awe type move with respect to easing liquidity and improving the current climate was in order. For now its going to work.\"</p> <p><strong>Olle Holmgren</strong>, an analyst at <strong>Seb Merchant Bank</strong> said the action was a logical reaction to the global turmoil and believes more cuts are to follow. \"This certainly isn't the last cut either. You can bring forward the cuts they have put in their prognoses.\"</p> <p>However, Holmgren was uncertain as it whether this will prevent slowing growth. \"It will be a support to growth, but it's still the case that we face a period of low growth and that won't change because of what they have done here,\" he said.</p> <p><strong>Subodh Kumar</strong>, strategist at <strong>Subodh Kumar &amp; Association</strong> said the rate cuts was just a psychological factor for the markets and the real action today was the injection of liquidity.</p> <p>The <strong>Council of Mortgage Lenders </strong>welcomed the Bank of England's half-point cut. </p> <p>CML director general <strong>Michael Coogan</strong> said: \"Today's package of bank funding and capital measures is further strengthened by this rate cut. Not only are the tripartite authorities now pulling together decisively to address domestic confidence, but international central bankers are also collaborating much more effectively on their position. All this decisive action augurs well for an improving market situation looking ahead, even though no one is pretending the tough times are over yet.\" </p> <p>Similarly, the <strong>British Chambers of Commerce</strong>, who not long ago warned that recession was inevitable in the UK, were \"thrilled\" by the cut and called for more.</p> <p>The director general of the BCC, <strong>David Frost</strong>, said: \"We are thrilled that the Bank of England has taken this bold and necessary step,\" he said. \"The economy has been facing an emergency, and the MPC could not afford to wait. This cut will, for now, steady the markets and inject much needed confidence. Over the next four months, interest rates must be cut to four per cent as a minimum.\" </p> <p><strong>Nicholas Leeming</strong>, director of propertyfinder.com, says today's surprise interest rate cut came not a moment too soon.</p> <p>\"It has massive psychological importance for the millions of mortgage borrowers who have been holding their breaths waiting for the MPC to ease the pain. It's too early to foresee an immediate return to health for the housing market, but this is a crucial first step to encourage people to consider moving home again.\"</p> <p><strong>Julian Jessop</strong> at <strong>Capital Economics</strong> was more cautious about how much relief the rate cuts will bring. </p> <p>\"We fear that there is still a lot more work to do. For a start, the fact that the central banks have had to take such extreme measures underlines how bad market conditions have become.\"</p> <p>He pointed out that the Federal Reserve have already cut rates from 5.25% last September to 2% before today's move, without much progress in shoring up the economy or stabilising the financial system.</p> <p>\"Another half point alone will not make much difference. More generally, the economic and financial imbalances have taken years to build up and may take just as long to unwind. Accordingly, we expect today's moves to be the first in a series - whether coordinated or at scheduled meetings - with rates eventually falling to 2.5% in the UK, 2.0% in the eurozone and just 0.5% in the US.\"</p> <p><strong>Miles Templeman</strong>, director general of the <strong>Institute of Directors</strong>, agreed that the only direction interest rates are heading now is down.</p> <p>\"We strongly believe that a further interest rate reduction of 50 basis points will be required next month, if not before,\" he said. \"Inflation was yesterday's story, recession is today's story and deflation is tomorrow's risk. Interest rates are heading in one direction \u2013 down.\"</p> <p><strong>Philip Shaw</strong>, economist at <strong>Investec</strong> said today's action brings hope after weeks of gloom. \"If you put everything together: the rate cut, the recapitalisation and the forthcoming details on the BoE's liquidity operations, there are some big glimmers of hope after a very torrid 3 1/2 weeks, where the outlook has been looking increasingly gloomy.\"</p>",

It's ridiculous and insulting to use images to peddle hamburgers,\" he said. \"Fans should boycott McDonald's, and not just in Liverpool.\"</p> <p>A McDonald's spokeswoman said the pictures represented \"the outstanding contribution the Beatles made to both local and global culture.\" Apparently Macca does not feel that meat sandwiches have done likewise.</p>",
  "<p>If the market was expecting the \u00a350bn - or \u00a3500bn depending on which way you look at it - bail-out of UK banks, this lunchtime's co-ordinated 50 basis point rate cut by the world's leading central banks was more of a surprise.</p> <p>Many commentators had called for a cut, but actually getting it is a different matter. The market barely knows what to make of it, however. Is it enough to rescue the global economy, or is it a panic measure smacking of too little, too late?</p> <p>James Knightley of ING Bank commented: \"Some analysts have argued that rate cuts would do little in the current environment, but given central banks are increasingly taking on the role of lender of last resort it will lower borrowing costs e.g. those borrowing from the Fed's discount window.</p> <p>\"This is unlikely to be the end of the easing cycle. Given we are in a recessionary environment with plunging commodity prices we suspect deflation is a realistic threat to a number of countries. It is therefore likely that further monetary policy easing will be forthcoming in the next new months from all these central banks.\"</p> <p>Initially the <strong>FTSE 100 </strong>reversed its falls on the rate cut news, climbing by nearly 40 points having been down 112 points at the time of the midday announcement.</p> <p>Now it is down 1.9 points at 4603.3.</p> <p>Most of the banks are holding onto their gains, though. <strong>HBOS</strong> is the main beneficiary, on the basis that its takeover by <strong>Lloyds TSB</strong> is now more likely to go through. HBOS is up 58% at 149p, more than regaining yesterday's losses.</p> <p>Lloyds is up 2% at 230p while <strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong> is 21% better at 108.8p.</p> <p>But <strong>Standard Chartered</strong> has lost 5.8% to \u00a312.35. It has been hit by the fall in Asian stock markets overnight, but investors have also been taken aback by its inclusion on the government's bail-out list. There are suggestions that if it decides to take up the government's offer it might need to raise cash to boost its Tier 1 capital ratio to the required level.</p> <p>Miners, which had been hard hit earlier as metal prices fell further on demand worries, have regained some ground after the rate cuts. </p> <p><strong>Kazakhmys</strong>, which fell as low at 351p, is now down 13p at 400.5p while <strong>Vedanta Resources</strong> has lost 28p to 977p. </p> <p>Supermarket group J.Sainsbury is down 11.5p at 303.25p as Kaupthing places the 10% stake held by entrepreneur Robert Tchenguiz at 250p a share.

  "<p>The response to today's announcement of a long-awaited bail-out package for the UK banking sector has been broadly positive, with some in the City talking of a \"new era for banking\". There were also fresh calls for a reduction in interest rates from the Bank of England tomorrow.</p> <p><strong>Germany's deputy finance minister</strong>, <strong>Joerg Asmussen</strong>, said: \"We welcome this approach from the British government because it contributes to the stability of the British financial system and we know what importance that has for the European financial system.\"</p> <p><strong>Vince Cable</strong>, the <strong>Liberal Democrats' Treasury spokesman</strong>, broadly welcomed the package but was concerned at how long it took to be announced. \"The last 48 hours have been a mess,\" he said, adding that an announcement on Monday would have prevented \"an enormous amount of money [being] wiped off share values\". He said the government needed to find out where the leaks came from.</p> <p>\"No one has any guarantee that this will work,\" he cautioned. The nearest precedent was in the Nordic countries in the early 90s where it did work, \"but this is a much bigger crisis\". \"This is only part of what is required, not all of it,\" he said, calling for an interest rate cut from the Bank of England at the end of its two-day meeting tomorrow.</p> <p>Cable thought a run on Britain's banks had been averted. \"I don't think there is any evidence of retail depositors fleeing banks, which would be a disaster,\" he said. </p> <p>But he added: \"There are bits of the British economy which are really feeling the pain already... Housebuilding companies are in big difficulty, and a lot of people are struggling with their mortgage payments.\" He said the government now needs to address issues affecting households like repossession.</p> <p><strong>John Cridland</strong>, the <strong>CBI deputy director general</strong>, welcomed \"today's essential measures which strengthen the British banking system, and will help provide financial stability for the country.\" </p> <p>He added: \"British business is facing a freezing of bank finance. Many companies need this action to keep investment and working capital flowing. This step to build confidence in the City needs to be followed tomorrow by a half-point cut in interest rates to boost consumer confidence.\"</p> <p><strong>John Wright</strong>, chairman of the <strong>Federation of Small Businesses</strong>, said: \"This is an ideal opportunity now that the government has a big stake in the banks to enter into a constructive dialogue with them about their commercial practices and their charges regarding small businesses. Almost half of our members have seen an increase in the cost of finance over the last year. It is crucial in these tough times that small businesses have access to fair overdraft and loan rates. Today's announcement should be coupled with assurances that more money will be made available to small businesses to help sustain them and get them through the next year.\" </p> <p><strong>Michael Coogan</strong>, director general of the <strong>Council of Mortgage Lenders</strong>, said: \"From what we can see so far, this seems to be a decisive, coordinated and reasonable package of measures that address both the relevant factors necessary to support a return to market stability. The flow of funding to support mortgage lending has been severely constrained, and these measures will help to create more positive conditions for the mortgage market.\"</p> <p><strong>Adrian Coles</strong>, director general of the <strong>Building Societies Association</strong>, was happy to see that all building societies are fully eligible - if they wish - for the package of financial support. \"Societies have strong balance sheets, are well capitalised, have high levels of liquidity and have experienced record savings inflows over the past year, but it is good that societies are not excluded from this package. Societies' inclusion will give them maximum flexibility to react to the extraordinary events now occurring in the markets,\" he said.</p> <p><strong>Derek Simpson</strong>, joint leader of the <strong>Unite union</strong>, welcomed the bail-out, but added: \"The union is demanding that this financial support is tied to clear commitments to secure vital jobs in the financial services sector. The government finance must serve to make the industry more transparent and accountable.\" </p> <p>He said today's measures should be extended to include pledges by the banks of no job losses, no repossessions of homes and no rewards for \"failure\". He added: \"It is imperative that the financial measures announced today mark the turning point in the world of banking and finance. Workers in the financial services industry are not the culprits of the credit crunch and we are not prepared to allow them to become the victims.\"</p> <p><strong>David Kern</strong>, economic adviser to the <strong>British Chambers of Commerce</strong>, welcomed the \"radical measures\" announced by the government. \"We hope the package will restore stability,\" he added. </p> <p>\"But given the erratic mood in the financial markets, there remains a risk of renewed speculative attacks. In the current situation, the authorities must not be taken by surprise. If the need arises, they must have additional instruments at their disposal.</p> <p>\"The financial turmoil must not be allowed to damage the real economy. It is critically important to restore confidence. The vital flow of finance to businesses and consumers must be maintained at all costs. A cut in interest rates tomorrow, and a reduction in business taxes, remain vital steps.\"</p> <p><strong>Robert Jenkins</strong>, chairman of the <strong>Investment Management Association</strong>, said: \"There is a liquidity problem, a bank solvency problem and a confidence problem. These measures are positive for interbank liquidity and a necessary step towards much needed bank recapitalisation. Whether or not the sums involved are sufficient, hinges on the extent to which the banks have accurately valued their assets. This uncertainty needs to be addressed fully to restore confidence. We would also expect the banks to consult with their long term institutional shareholders as to the terms of the arrangements they will be entering with the government.\"</p> <p><strong>Roger Lawson</strong>, of the <strong>UK Shareholders Association</strong>, welcomed the government proposals to improve the capitalisation and liquidity of the banking sector. \"Providing preference share capital on appropriate terms, or even equity finance, if this would assist banks is likely to be of benefit to everyone, including the bank's shareholders.</p> <p>\"However the suggestion that the government will enforce reductions in dividends, or even total suspension which has been suggested in some press reports, will dismay many of our members who rely on such dividends for their retirement income. Similarly the general public will suffer a major reduction in their pension benefits in many cases if the dividend income to institutional pension funds was restricted. </p> <p>\"To disturb the normal relationship between investors and companies by dictatorial policies on dividends by the government or other interference in their normal affairs would be of great concern, although clearly if there is a normal commercial negotiation on the terms attached to the provision of preference share capital then that would be a different matter. The consideration of what is a prudent dividend policy going forward should be something primarily for the companies and their boards to decide, and they should not be forced to take on additional capital on terms with which they may not be happy,\" Lawson said.</p> <p><strong>Paul Niven</strong>, head of asset allocation at <strong>F&amp;C</strong>, said: \"It is too soon to make strong conclusions over the long-term impact of the move on the banks themselves but, in our view, we have now entered a new era for global banking. In return for taxpayers' money. the state will gain a level of control over their governance, pay, and lending practices. Regulation will increase markedly and controls on all elements of banking practices will rise.</p> <p>\"While the moves by the UK have to be viewed positively, and a step in the right direction, we are still seeing piecemeal actions by governments to address their domestic issues. For these individual actions to be effective we need much more from countries which have done little, as yet, to directly address the issue of bank recapitalisation, arguably including the US. The UK has set out a model which shows the banks having to bow to the State in terms of national versus shareholder interest. The new model for capitalism has been set out.\"</p> <p></p> <p><strong>Alex Potter</strong>, banking analyst at <strong>Collins Stewart</strong>, said: \"Government finally comes up with a viable bank rescue plan. Having procrastinated for far too long, the UK government has finally reacted to the actions of, inter alia, the Irish, Danes, Swedes and Germans and instituted a bank rescue/stability plan.\"</p> <p>He added: \"This plan should work - but will materially impact dividends. We feel that the wholesale funding plan is key to short-term stability and that the capital raisings should stabilise banks further out. As such, we anticipate some short-run price recovery. </p> <p>\"However, the government is insisting on tighter control of capital, dividends and executive pay. We feel that dividend payouts for the main four UK domestic banks will be severely impacted with the possibility of no cash payout until 2010 or later. HSBC and Standard Chartered will participate but, we believe, mainly to remove the stigma of participation \u2013 we see little/no dividend impact for these two banks. HBOS has most to gain from such funding guarantees,\" Potter said.</p> <p><strong>Jonathan Loynes</strong>, chief European economist at <strong>Capital Economics</strong>, said: \"The moves are clearly welcome and go rather further than press reports had suggested. But there are good reasons why they are unlikely to prevent a sharp contraction in the growth of bank lending from contributing to a major downturn in the UK economy. </p> <p>\"Meanwhile, there are clear concerns over the fiscal implications. If \u2013 and this is not yet clear \u2013 the \u00a350bn adds directly to public borrowing, this would push borrowing above \u00a3100bn a year, perhaps rising to \u00a3150bn in two years, or higher as the full effects of the economic downturn are felt. Needless to say, this prospect could put some upward pressure on long\u2013term bond yields. Nonetheless, with the plans not likely to relieve the need for very aggressive cuts in interest rates \u2013 we now expect rates to fall to 2.5% or below \u2013 the pressure on market interest rate expectations and short-term bond yields will remain strongly downwards.\"</p> <p><strong>Richard Cantor</strong>, <strong>Moody's</strong> chief credit officer, said government support of liquidity-constrained banks is playing a \"very supportive role\" for the banking sector and its ratings, but the extension of support has not resulted in upgrades \u2013 and in some cases has not precluded downgrades \u2013 of the affected banks. In a new report, he said that Moody's will \"continue to take rating actions on those banks whose long-run financial strengths no longer appear consistent with their current ratings, but it is not undertaking systematic downgrades across the banking sector.\" </p> <p>The <strong>Charles Stanley</strong> analyst, <strong>Jeremy Batstone-Carr</strong>, described the package as a \"truly historic\" moment which requires a \"quid pro quo\" for taxpayers, in return for the funding bail-out. \"Taxpayers are going to have stakes in clearing banks and we are going to have some say in how the banks are run and the remuneration of senior executives.\" </p> <p>Banks will be precluded from the extravagant lending practices of the past with profits lower but businesses more stable, he said. \"This is utterly extraordinary. We are talking about a gigantic sum of money,\" he added.</p> <p>Leftwing <strong>Labour MP John McDonnell</strong> said: \"Without full nationalisation the government is effectively nationalising the banks' losses and privatising the profits so that taxpayers will now pay for this crisis caused by the greed of the bankers.\"</p> <p><strong>Guardian and Observer</strong> commentator <strong>Will Hutton</strong> said: \"This will make the British, who were the weakest part of the international chain, the strongest part of the international chain.\" But he warned: \"This is the battle won, but not the war over. There are toxic debts on the British banks' balance sheets and these have to be taken off.\"</p>",
  "<p>The truth is that no one has any idea what is going on. I bought some <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/07/marketturmoil.royalbankofscotlandgroup\">shares in RBS</a> a couple of months ago, on the reliable advice from a financier friend, who assured me that we'd reached the bottom of the market, and the only was up. I was going to make a killing! Suffice to say that I won't be calling on him for advice again. </p> <p>But what's just as interesting as the crashing of bank stocks \u2013 and what might give us some pause for thought, before we celebrate too much about the humbling of Wall Street and the City \u2013 is that clean energy equities have also nosedived. Gamesa, a Spanish wind turbine manufacturer, <a href=\"http://uk.finance.yahoo.com/q/hp?s=GAM.MC\">has lost 45% of its value</a> in the last quarter. Shares in Vestas, another wind power company, have fallen substantially since September, while Germany's Q-Cells \u2013 a solar panel firm \u2013 has been on a steady downward trend for a year. </p> <p>Why? Because optimism about the future has evaporated. No one thinks that substantial clean energy investments can be made so long as the money markets are in crisis \u2013 without sufficient liquidity to oil the wheels of financial capitalism, nothing much gets built. This might be good news in the case of things like a third runway at Heathrow \u2013 hopefully, one of the longer-term casualties of the credit crunch. It might also be good for the Amazon rainforest: the Brazilian environment minister Carlos Minc <a href=\"http://www.planetark.com/dailynewsstory.cfm/newsid/50526/story.htm\">has admitted quite frankly</a> that the fall in global commodity prices will do more to ease the immediate pressure of deforestation than any move by his government. </p> <p>But in the medium to long term, once the immediate problems in the financial sector have been ironed out, we need a planned transition towards a cleaner future, not a headlong collapse into a new depression. That means \u2013 contrary to the suggestion of the \"all growth is bad\" school \u2013 that we need to grow our way out of this economic mess. A return to Keynesianism could be a good thing for the environment, if government-backed spending and investment drives growth in areas where it is desperately needed, especially particularly clean energy. The old days of environment versus jobs are over \u2013 we don't need to sacrifice quality of life in order to stimulate the economy. This point was made eloquently and persuasively in the recent New Economics Foundation report called <a href=\"http://www.neweconomics.org/gen/greennewdealneededforuk210708.aspx\">A Green New Deal</a>. As <a href=\"http://www.planetark.com/dailynewsstory.cfm/newsid/50514/story.htm\">Achim Steiner observes</a>, this is now our economic future \u2013 employment has already shifted substantially from fossil fuel industries to renewables.</p> <p>It is to the great credit of many politicians \u2013 and I don't say this lightly \u2013 that \"green\" imperatives have not fallen by the wayside in the looming recession, possibly because it is now more widely understood that green growth is already a reality, and can help us get out of the current crisis. Replacing short-haul flights between UK cities with a high-speed train network, as the Conservatives are suggesting, would substantially reduce transport pollution \u2013 and create a boom in the railway engineering industry, with knock-on benefits in terms of growth and the wider economy. A new generation of nuclear power stations (sorry to <a href=\"http://www.marklynas.org/2008/9/19/why-greens-must-learn-to-love-nuclear-power\">keep banging on about this</a>) would achieve a similar outcome: the main reason why France's per-capita CO2 emissions are a third lower than ours is because the country generates 80% of its power from nuclear fission. We desperately need investment in this sector \u2013 not just in hard concrete, but in skills, too. </p> <p>The government, too, is showing leadership \u2013 and strategic grasp \u2013 by setting up a new <a href=\"http://www.decc.gov.uk/\">Department of Energy and Climate Change</a>, pulling climate action away from the limp grasp of Defra and putting it at the top level of government, where it belongs. Climate change is not a sub-section of the environment, a matter for greens only: having a habitable climate is a precondition for the survival of the entire human economy at any meaningful scale. The government seems to realise this, and the recommendation of Adair Turner's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/oct/07/carbon.emissions.targets\">Climate Change Committee</a> that our national targets be upped to an 80% cut by 2050 is another welcome step in the right direction. Note also, that this target can probably be met at no net cost, as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/07/edmiliband.carbonemissions\">Oliver Tickell notes</a>. </p> <p>Even if the necessary investments do \"cost\", however, this is spending that will stimulate the economy overall: in the longer term, we need to transform completely the energy basis of industrial civilisation. Anyone thinking of this as a terrible sacrifice is dead wrong; it is an unparallelled business opportunity, which canny companies will use to their great advantage. </p> <p>Capitalism is a flexible beast, and we need to use the current crisis to give it a shove in the right direction \u2013 not to try to kill it for good.</p>",

  "<p>Tackling violent extremism is not a new challenge for this country. When I was at school there was the seemingly ever-present threat from terrorists, starkly illustrated on our TV screens with scenes of bombings in Birmingham and Guildford. And in history lessons up and down the country, children still learn about the actions of Guy Fawkes and his November plot to blow up Parliament.</p> <p>But as times change the threat evolves. The principal cause for security concerns today come from groups linked to al-Qaida, who use an ideology that twists the teachings of a peaceful religion into a justification for extreme violence. Meanwhile other forms of extremism and racial or hate-driven prejudice are sowing divisions in our communities and causing alienation among a small minority of young people.</p> <p>We have learnt from past experience that a security response is not enough. We need to address the underlying issues that can drive people into the hands of violent extremist groups and encourage local communities to come together to expose the flaws in extremists' arguments, to reject cruelty and violence and promote core British values of tolerance, liberty, fairness and the rule of law.</p> <p>Young people are already very much alive to these problems and are keen for the opportunity to express their views and air their concerns. A recent report by the UK Youth Parliament showed 94% of young people think schools are the best environment to discuss preventing terrorism and violent extremism. </p> <p>That is why I am publishing <a href=\"http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/publications/violentextremism/toolkitforschools\">a toolkit for schools</a> to help them contribute to the prevention of violent extremism. It shows how schools can help pupils of all ages to develop the knowledge and skills to challenge and debate, through programmes such as Seal in primary schools and Citizenship in secondary schools, and encourages an ethos which promotes respect and engagement with the wider community around the school.</p> <p>I have spent the last few months discussing the challenges of preventing violent extremism with young people, teachers and other professionals across the country. I have been struck by the commitment and engagement from all communities to come together to challenge those who seek to undermine the principles of respect and tolerance on which our society is based. </p> <p>A small minority of schools have had to deal with the consequences of pupils or former pupils being caught up with criminal activity linked to extremist views, or of their local communities being affected by violent extremist activities. This must be one of the most challenging issues a teacher will come across and requires great professionalism and sensitivity. </p> <p>This is not about teachers monitoring pupils. Instead the toolkit responds to feedback from teachers and others on the need for more practical advice on how to support vulnerable pupils, working alongside other local partners and community organisations. It contains case studies such as a programme with Muslims in Oxford which equips pupils with arguments against a violent extremist ideology and helps to develop the foundation of a British-Islamic identity.</p> <p>And because a local partnership approach, tailored to the needs of particular communities, is so important, I am providing funding to all local authorities so they can lead in providing local information to go alongside the toolkit to support schools in this work. </p> <p>The toolkit shows how schools can build on work they are already doing. For example from this year Ofsted will begin to inspect schools on their duty to promote community cohesion; and since a trial in Bradford, many schools are now engaged in school linking projects which see children from different cultures, religions and backgrounds coming together to work together on joint projects. This kind of cooperative spirit can help break down the barriers between different groups that can lead to mistrust.</p> <p>I am constantly impressed by our nation's young people. They give me great hope for Britain's future. Yesterday the communities secretary, Hazel Blears, and I met the new Young Muslims' Advisory Group. They displayed all the intelligence, maturity and insight that young people are all too rarely credited with. They also displayed a refreshing lack of cynicism. But they made the point that many young people do have genuine grievances that need to be aired \u2013 rather than allowed to fester. </p> <p>They represented all that is best about multi-cultural Britain based on our core values: engagement with the community, wider society and politics; an ability to discuss controversial issues without resort to polarised rhetoric; an interest and acceptance of other cultures while retaining pride in their own; and a confidence that this country can accommodate different races, religions and ideals - indeed that tolerance is a defining characteristic of being British.</p> <p>I think with groups like this, who have that unique power to influence their peers, plus advice to school staff and the wider community, such as the toolkit published today, we can begin to work towards a country in which terrorism really is consigned to history.</p>",

  "<p>A new clampdown on MPs expenses has been proposed as it emerged today that one of the factors that led a parliamentary watchdog to clear cabinet couple, Ed Balls and Yvette Cooper, of wrongdoing was where they ate Sunday lunch.</p> <p>John Lyon, the parliamentary commissioner, said that although the Green Book of rules on parliamentary expenses says that an MP's main home is \"normally\" where they spend more nights, the rule should not always be rigidly applied and his final decision rested partly on which home they were more \"emotionally\" attached to.</p> <p>But he has recommended that the \u00a324,000-a-year allowance for second homes should now be cut for all MPs who share accommodation in London to curb potential abuse of the system.</p> <p>The decision comes in the wake of a six-month inquiry into a complaint from Malcolm Moss, Conservative MP for North East Cambridgeshire, who queried whether Balls and Cooper - two of Gordon Brown's closest colleagues - had broken Commons rules by claiming that a recently purchased four-bedroomed home in north London was their second home when they spent more time in London than in their Yorkshire constituencies.</p> <p>The inquiry cleared the two ministers. The Commons standards and privileges committee said: \"The commissioner has dismissed the complaint, having concluded, in the light of his investigation, that 'Ms Cooper and Mr Balls made reasonable decisions on the basis of their own circumstances in declaring their property in Castleford to be their main home'.\"</p> <p>Lyons wrote: \"In the case of Ms Cooper and Mr Balls it is clear that, neither in prospect nor in practice, have they spent more nights in Castleford than in any other location. They both expected to spend and have spent more nights in London than in any other location.</p> <p>\"The members do not - and cannot - rely therefore on their number of overnight stays to establish their main home as being in Castleford.\"</p> <p>His decision finally rested partly on where the family ate Sunday lunch - which tended to be Castleford in Yorkshire rather than London. This factor was seen as showing which home they were more attached to.</p> <p>But the inquiry also threw up the question whether both ministers should have submitted expense claims on the same house. In theory they could now claim up to \u00a348,000 a year - in fact they claimed just over \u00a324,000 - the maximum claim for one member.</p> <p>Lyon has ruled that the allowances should change. \"I am not convinced that, where members share accommodation, they should each be able to claim up to the full single members' allowance... nor would I confine this only to members who are married couples or who are partner of another member. </p> <p>\"It seems to me that once members share properties with each other, even if they do not share other aspects of their lives, they should have a sharers allowance, which is less than the sum of the allowances available to each member singly.\"</p> <p>In a joint statement, Balls and Cooper accused Moss of seeking to make political capital out of the complaint.</p> <p>\"We welcome the parliamentary commissioner's decision to dismiss this complaint after a full investigation and his conclusion that we acted fully in accordance with both the letter and the spirit of the rules of the house,\" they said.</p> <p>\"As the commissioner's report shows, the allegation made by Conservative MP Malcolm Moss was politically motivated.</p> <p>The report discloses that when the couple sold their first home in London to buy their new house they had to pay capital gains tax on the deal because they had registered their Yorkshire home as their main residence.</p>",

  "<!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>4.05pm:</strong> A final market update, the FTSE 100 is just shy of 250 points down.</p> <p>I'm wrapping up this blog now but for continuing news and reaction to today's decisions stay tuned to the site. As one of my colleagues said: \"They've already pledged \u00a3500bn and cut interest rates by 0.5%, what more can happen?\"<br>Those sound suspiciously like famous last words.</p> <p>Thanks for reading and for your comments, I'm off on holiday for three weeks now. Hopefully the economy will be revitalised by the time I return but I'm not banking (arf, arf) on it.<br></p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>3.30pm:</strong> P<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/newsnight/paulmason/\">aul Mason, Newsnight's economics editor</a>, suggests on his blog that the time taken for the government to reach a deal may have been due to resistance from HSBC, the one bank whose share price has remained relatively robust during the crisis. There is also the hint that other banks may have been less than enthusiastic.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>3.25pm:</strong> Economists have given their<a href=\"http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/news/article.html?in_article_id=454163&amp;in_page_id=2\"> predictions of where interest rates are set to go</a> from here on This is Money.</p> <p>Howard Archer, economist at City research firm Global Insight - 4% by the end of the year</p> <p>Simon Rubinsohn, chief economist for the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors - 3.5% by the middle of next year.</p> <p>Douglas McWilliams, chief executive of the Centre for Economics and Business Research - as low as 2% by the end of next year.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>3.15pm:</strong> Labour MP John McDonnell is one of the few public figures who has questioned the wisdom of today's action by the government. While politicians of every hue have been eager to present a united front in the face of the crisis the left wing MP is not convinced, despite being someone, who in his own words, \"has been calling for the nationalisation of the banking sector since this crisis began\"&gt;. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/oct/08/creditcrunch.banking\">On Comment is Free, he describes the plan as \"reckless\"</a>.</p> <blockquote> <p>This deal is like your neighbour going on a massive spending binge \u2013 throwing a party, buying a new car, going on holiday \u2013 and then sending you the bill. Taxpayers will end up paying doubly, once through loose subsidies to dodgy banks and the second time as the recession bites and they risk losing their jobs, homes and going further into debt.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>2.50pm:</strong> The interest rate cut - the US rate now stands at 1.5% - seems to have had a <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/money/markets/2008-10-08-stocks-wednesday_N.htm\">positive effect on the Dow Jones</a>, which is now up 25.4 points.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>2.45pm:</strong> The Economist says the government package \"cannot be faulted for its ambition\" but is <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/finance/displayStory.cfm?story_id=12375332&amp;source=features_box_main\">gloomy about the extent of the boost it can deliver</a> to the UK economy.</p> <blockquote> <p>The big worry about the plan is that, conceived in crisis, it will do no more than stave off the worst effects on the economy. Mr Darling expects banks to lend more to small businesses and homebuyers in return for government support. But with the downturn now gathering momentum and house prices now falling so sharply, there will be little appetite for businesses and households to take on more debt. Even the the Bank of England's dramatic decision to cut interest rates on Wednesday may have come too late to avoid a wrenching recession.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>2.40pm:</strong> FTSE update. The market is down by around 130 points.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>1.35pm:</strong> Money Week deputy editor John Stepek has written an interesting article entitled <a href=\"http://www.moneyweek.com/news-and-charts/the-banking-sector-turns-into-the-public-sector-13778.aspx\">\"UK banks: what's really happening\"</a>. He talks about how we got here and what today's announcement means.</p> <blockquote> <p>It means we've acknowledged that banks are broke. It means existing shareholders will be diluted, while the national debt may well soar, and taxes may have to rise at some point to pay for it. We may see some sort of return from this in the very long term, but don't bet on it.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>1.15pm:</strong> The Footsie was up 17 points to 4622.2 a short time ago.</p> <p>George Gallowy, the Respect MP, came up with a priceless response in the Commons to today's events:</p> <blockquote> <p>Liberals seemed like Labour and the Conservatives are communists </p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>1.05pm:</strong> Faisal Islam, from Channel 4 news has <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/business_money/05+per+cent+interest+rate+cut/2491677\">described the interest rate cut</a> as \"epic news\" and part of \"a four pronged attack designed to kill the credit crunch\". <br>Is that the most dramatic reaction to today's events by a commentator so far? If you've seen better/worse, please share them.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>1.00pm:</strong> Lloyds TSB and HBOS have both said they are passing on the interest rate cut to mortgage holders on a standard variable rate.<br>Canada, Sweden and Switzerland have all cut rates, as well as the European Central Bank, the Bank of England and the US Federal Bank.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>12.45pm:</strong> Alistair Darling is speaking in the Commons, he says the Bank of England will be pumping \"at least \u00a3200bn\" into the financial system through the special liquidity scheme \". That's in addition to the money that has already been injected through the scheme. </p> <p>The Treasury is making available a further \u00a3250bn to guarantee \"any new debt issued by banks\". This measure applies to medium-term debt and is intended to get banks lending to each other.</p> <p>So that \u00a350bn has risen to \u00a3500bn. Darling says the lending to banks will be done on commercial terms. He describes the impact on public finances as \"exceptional and mostly temporary\".</p> <p>In return for investing in the banks he says he will be looking at executive pay and lending practices.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>12.25pm:</strong> It is apparently the first 0.5% cut since the 9/11 attacks on the US. The former home secretary, David Blunkett, described the coordinated nature of the cut as \"unusual and extremely valuable\" on Sky News. Former Tory chancellor Kenneth Clarke has been taking Blunkett to task for Labour's claim that the US is to blame for the current crisis. \"Public finances here are much worse than elsewhere,\" he said.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>12.15pm:</strong> The FTSE reacted to the interest rate cut by recovering most of the day's losses. It was briefly up on the day after the announcement.<br>European banks have also cut rates by 0.5%.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>12.10pm:</strong> The surprise cut, announced by Brown during PMQs (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2008/oct/08/pmqs.gordonbrown\">follow live coverage here</a>), was coordinated with other developed countries, including the US, the PM says.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>12.00pm:</strong> The Bank of England has announced that it is cutting interest rates by 0.5%. It's unprecedented in that it comes a day before the bank's Monetary Policy Committee were due to meet. The rate now stands at 4.5%</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>11.55am:</strong> John Redwood, chairman of the Conservative party's economic competitiveness policy group <a href=\"http://www.johnredwoodsdiary.com/\">writes on his blog</a>. \"At least we are not going the route of more bank nationalisation.\" He is of course only partly right. There seems to be a general fear among politicians to refer to nationalisation as opposed to re-capitalisation. </p> <p>He criticises the leaks that contributed to stock market volatility yesterday but says \"any sensible person\" will be hoping the government plan succeeds. Now he wants to see the banks do their bit:</p> <blockquote> <p>What more are they waiting for? Will they now start to resume more normal lending and borrowing to each other? Will the great banks now set about sensitive and sensible banking of all the businesses and individuals in the country, at a time of downturn and difficulty? That means making facilities available where a business has a potentially viable future. Given the extent of state support, the public will be expecting helpful and mature banking on the high street.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>11.45am:</strong> Peter Hoskin is positive about Brown's statement on the bank rescue plan (<a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7658624.stm\">watch it here</a>), even if he is damning him with faint praise to an extent. He writes on <a href=\"http://www.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2205061/the-50-billion-bailout-browns-statement.thtml\">the Spectator's coffee house blog</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>It's full of the usual reminders about \"global problems\" which \"started in America\", and platitudes about \"fresh and innovative intervention\" and \"long-term challenges\". But, to be honest, this is an arena in which Brown thrives. His dour bank manager shtick lends itself to talk about liquidity, assets and guarantees. The question now is whether voters and companies are convinced by it.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>11.35am:</strong> For those who have struggled to understand the complexities of the financial crisis, which has seen us learn the meaning of toxic assets, complex derivatives and short sellers, my politics colleague Deborah Summers has forwarded me a link to the satirical website Daily Mash, which has <a href=\"http://www.thedailymash.co.uk/news/business/banks-to-lend-you-your-own-money-200810081308/\">a very straightforward guide to today's announcement</a>. \"Banks to lend you your own money, \" it announces.</p> <blockquote> <p>The government is to invest \u00a350bn of your money in British banks so they can lend it back to you with interest.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>11.25am:</strong> The good news is that banking stocks are up on today's announcement. RBS shares, which fell by more than a third yesterday, were up more than 25% last time I looked, while HBOS, another heavy faller yesterday, was up more than 50%. The bad news is that the FTSE 100 is down significantly, around 170 points.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>11.20am:</strong> In <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/oct/08/banking.economy1\">this morning's press conference</a> Gordon Brown said today's decision was \"comprehensive, specific and breaks new ground\".</p> <p>He added: \"This is not a time for outdated thinking or conventional dogma but for fresh and innovative intervention that gets to the heart of the problem.\"<br>That's one way of describing nationalisation.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>10.45am: </strong><a href=\"http://www.fool.co.uk/news/investing/2008/10/08/this-silly-selling-must-end-soon.aspx?linkplacement=HPcontentbox2\">Bruce Jackson on Motley Fool</a> is optimistic about the government intervention.</p> <blockquote> <p>Will it thaw the credit markets? It should. In time, I think it will. How long? It could happen any day. Like the stock market, the credit markets are completely lacking in confidence. They are wrought with fear\u2026the fear of failure. They just need firstly a few days, then a few weeks, of relative calm. Then we can all get back to the business of buying great companies at good prices.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>10.15am:</strong> In an article written before Darling's announcement <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/damianreece/3154784/We-need-more-than-Darlings-50bn-gamble-to-stave-off-recession.html\">another unlikely supporter of nationalisation could be found in the shape of the Telegraph</a>, although it managed to avoid any reference to the \"n word\". Instead Damian Reece writes: \"Recapitalisation is the right thing to do.\" He says all banks' capital ratios (essentially capital relative to risk-weighted assets, which include credit) should be equalised. </p> <p>Interestingly, he also says: \"If I were the chief executive of HSBC for instance, a bank with little need for this extra and very expensive capital, I'd be expecting to see Darling agreeing to guarantee my depositors in return for my participation.\" </p> <p>Are these banks really in a position to negotiate? Even HSBC?</p> <!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>10.00am:</strong> <br>Words almost fail commentators on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/oct/08/creditcrunch.banking\">today's action by the government to save the banking industry</a>. Part-nationalisation of all the major banks would have been unthinkable just a few months ago, as would the thought of the Conservatives supporting such a policy.</p> <p>For the FT the bare facts of the matter are extraordinary enough without need to resort to hyperbole. \"<a href=\"http://ftalphaville.ft.com/blog/2008/10/08/16783/uk-banks-to-be-part-nationalised/\">UK banks to be part-nationalised</a>\" is the paper's front page headline. In an editorial - that again would have been unthinkable a few months ago - the paper lauds the bail out as \"the right course of action\" and estimates the the bill at anything up to \u00a32,000 apiece.</p> <p>\"<a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/sun_says/article244723.ece\">All we can do now is hold our breath</a> - and hope it works,\" says the<br>Sun's editorial on the plan. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/robertpeston/2008/10/a_very_big_rescue.html\">The BBC's apparently never-sleeping business editor, Robert Peston</a>,<br>who broke news of the bail-out yesterday, was furiously blogging away<br>by 7.30am. If banks do need the government cash, he warns, \"there<br>will be strings attached - such as restrictions on executive pay and<br>limitations on what it pays out in dividends to other shareholders.<br>Taking taxpayers' money will not be a licence to trade as normal.\"</p>",
  "<p>The geneticist Steve Jones has <a href=\"http://ukpress.google.com/article/ALeqM5g9tLQCxPmNVcuP-2YTtTq--zzW0A\">announced</a> that human evolution has stopped. This is based on a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/genetics\">genetic</a> view of the evolutionary process and while it is almost certainly true from a gene-centric perspective, it is really only addressing a small part of what it is to be human. While Jones is absolutely right when it comes to the slowing down of the effects of natural selection on the human gene pool, human evolution is not a purely genetic affair and the path of our development as a species cannot possibly be understood without an examination of the role played by cultural adaptations. </p> <p>The course of human evolution has displayed a complex relationship between biological adaptations (such as bipedalism or brain size) and cultural adaptations (such as tool use) since the development of the first stone tools, around 2.6 million years ago, in East Africa. The appearance of stone tools in the archaeological record was a major cultural adaptation that provided our ancestors with the ability to manipulate their environment \u2013 a process that lead to ever more complex behavioural innovations and one that has continued ever since.</p> <p>Our earliest hominin ancestors were very different in appearance to us \u2013 if still extant, they would look to us very \"ape-like\". This was the case for approximately five million years until the appearance, two million years ago, of Homo ergaster \u2013 the first human and the first to rely heavily on cultural adaptations rather than biological ones. The process of human evolution from two million years ago onwards was one of relatively small-scale biological changes in tandem with massive and far-reaching cultural development. It was the development of cultural adaptations that provided the basis for our evolutionary success and produced the current genetic pattern that Jones describes. The use of cultural adaptations, such as fire and clothing, removed the need for biological adaptation and meant that the basic body plan of the genus Homo has remained relatively unchanged. Although there are of course differences between species such as Homo ergaster, the Neanderthals and Homo sapiens, the factor that unites us all was the role that cultural innovation played in allowing a wide range of habitats to be exploited without the need for biological adaptation. Massive increases in intelligence, a biological process, provided the raw material for a huge range of cultural adaptation and environmental manipulation. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/07/stevejones.evolution\">Johnjoe McFadden argues</a> that Jones's view is incorrect and that the role of genetic engineering means that we will be soon be entering a period of evolutionary dynamism \u2013 a result of being able to tweak our genome to, for instance, remove cancer and other genetic diseases \u2013 an interesting idea but it overlooks the fact that many of these diseases take hold later in life, after reproduction, and as such could be argued to be relatively selectively neutral. Genes are not the only factor; the environment plays a huge role in our makeup. Simply put, genetic predisposition to heart disease is not the same as heart disease!</p> <p>Ultimately, genetics is only part of the story of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jun/09/religion.sciencenews\">human evolution</a>. While the process of genetic evolution is clearly slowing down and we are no longer subject to the widespread effects of natural selection, cultural evolution continues to play a crucial role in the development of the human species as it has done for nearly 2.6 million years. The pace of cultural adaptation is still moving rapidly and producing a greater range of variation than at any other time in our evolutionary history. We may be heading for a homogenous genetic future but the human evolutionary story tells us that our culture will continue to evolve and flourish as long as humans are around.</p>",
  "<p>Sir James Dyson, the millionaire vacuum inventor, has been forced to abandon his plans to set up a new school in Bath after the government rejected his funding bid.</p> <p>The entrepreneur hoped to open a pioneering school of design and engineering \u2013 the Dyson School of Design Innovation \u2013 in Bath.</p> <p>Through his charity, the James Dyson Foundation, he had pledged \u00a312.5m to the \u00a356m project that was to be joint-funded by the government.</p> <p>Dyson's plans have been hampered by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/sep/23/newschools.amesdyson&quot;\">planning and funding battles</a> over the past four years.</p> <p>The most recent opposition from the Environment Agency led to the local government minister, Baroness Andrews, calling a planning inquiry into the school's proposed location on a flood plain, which Dyson estimated could cost a further \u00a31m in fees.</p> <p>Yesterday, Dyson said the government had now rejected his latest funding proposal, which was the final nail in the school's coffin.</p> <p>He said: \"Faced with a planning inquiry and this government's recent rejection of our funding proposal, we have no choice but to abandon the plans for the school.</p> <p>\"We deeply regret having to give up on the opportunity to provide an exciting education for our young people.\"</p> <p>But he said he was still determined to help young people in design education.</p> <p>He said: \"We now intend to find another way to nurture young engineers \u2013 this time on our own terms.\"</p> <p>The project, which was first welcomed by government in 2004, has been in the planning process since July 2006.</p> <p>In December of the same year, issues with the building design on the proposed site were raised by government, forcing a redesign, increasing costs and causing a lengthy delay.</p> <p>In March, the Bath and North East Somerset authority voted in favour of the planned school, despite a planning officer's report recommending the reverse, but an objection by the Environment Agency meant the application was referred to the Government Office of the South West.</p> <p>Proposals for the school, which could not have accepted students until 2012 at the earliest, focused on providing 14- to 19-year-olds with opportunities to do hands-on engineering projects with industry experts.</p> <p>Dyson was keen to have the site in Bath because it is the city where he began his engineering career with manufacturer Rotork.</p>",
  "<p>The credit crunch has already hit the book trade, and its effects will be more and more visible in the coming months: but publishers are hoping this means changes to the stock rather than the till receipts.</p> <p>As stock indexes slide, thrifty how-to guides are already on the rise. Waterstone's, for instance, has seen 200% increases in sales of two titles about keeping chickens in recent weeks. \"And Carol Klein's Grow Your Own Veg sales are double what they were a year ago, which could be put down to people looking for long-term money-saving ideas in the current climate,\" says non-fiction buyer Alex Ingram.</p> <p>This Christmas will see the launch of a slew of thrifty titles as publishers look to profit from this demand, headed up by a timely new edition of Delia Smith's slump cuisine classic Frugal Food, and India Knight, the author of retail therapy guide The Shops having a go at making-do and mending. November's The Thrift Book: Live Well and Spend Less sees Knight variously detail how to make jam, use a sewing machine, dress on a budget, and make your own presents.</p> <p>Expect thrifty nostalgia too, as publishers mine their back catalogues to come up with money saving tips from days of yore. \"Books on saving string, thrift in World War Two - publishers would be well advised to check out their backlist and see if they've got these sorts of books,\" says Alan Samson, Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson publishing director.</p> <p>Looking from the other end of the telescope, a glut of proposals about the crisis on Wall Street have hit American publishers' desks over the last week, and million-dollar advances will be shielding the best of their authors from the crash's fallout. Too Big to Fail by New York Times business reporter Andrew Ross Sorkin, Six Days that Shook the World by Roger Lowenstein and a chronicle of events from Joe Nocera and Vanity Fair's Bethany McLean all commanded big sums at auction, but here in the UK the book industry is - so far - markedly more cautious.</p> <p>\"There's a lot of proposals flying around - both from well-placed journalists and City bankers who suddenly have more time on their hands. It's true that the readership for business and finance books has widened dramatically - suddenly everyone knows what short-selling is and has an opinion on HBOS,\" says Viking's editorial director Joel Rickett. \"But with so much media analysis already available, publishers have to be extremely careful to find books with substance and enduring quality.\"</p> <p>Samson agrees: \"Personally I think it is all too messy for a sensible book on the subject, and needs a little perspective before a really good book appears. In the words of William Goldman about the movie industry, nobody knows anything. But I can envisage a new and fictionalised analysis like Crash of 79 by Paul Erdman working 30 years later.\"</p> <p>Samson is also on the hunt for a book about \"a future dystopic global scenario\" such as John Hackett's Third World War, a novel imagining the next world war which became an international bestseller in the early 80s, or Alvin Toffler's runaway 70s bestseller Future Shock, about the difficulties inherent in advancement. </p> <p>Reading about hard times, meanwhile, is not the same as reading <em>for </em>them. The book trade is currently poring over the bestseller lists from previous eras of financial uncertainty, trying to work out how best to entertain a tighter-belted reading public. Back in the recession of the early 80s, cash-strapped readers were lapping up Jackie Collins sex, rock'n'roll and shopping saga Lovers and Gamblers. </p> <p>\"Stories of the mega-rich and royalty also seem to hold a perverse fascination when times are tough,\" says Viking editorial director Joel Rickett, and the start of the 80s was heralded by chart-topping performances for a biography of the Queen Mother by Godfrey Talbot, and Mark Girouard's look at Life in the English Country House. </p> <p>This is echoed in the recession of the early 1990s, when the non-fiction charts were topped by Andrew Morton's Diana: Her True Story and Peter Mayle's escapist A Year in Provence. In fiction, Jilly Cooper's monied classes romp Polo was number one, and this time round publishers are crossing their fingers that Olivia Darling's artworld melodrama Priceless, and Tasmina Perry's story of a luxury goods dynasty Guilty Pleasures, will be feeding the nation's daydreams.</p> <p>\"We're thinking more widely about the kind of books that sell when times are tight,\" says Rickett. \"Escapism is one answer: crime and thrillers will go on selling by the truckload. People will want to bury themselves in fast, compelling stories,\" and this is borne out by the huge sales enjoyed by the likes of Thomas Harris, Dick Francis and Jeffrey Archer during recent downturns. </p> <p>Romance publisher Mills &amp; Boon says it has traditionally enjoyed stronger sales in times of crisis, as miserable workers live an imaginary high life among handsome Arab sheikhs and smouldering Italian tycoons. \"Billionaires are here to stay - we've always been aspirational, that's part of our promise; we've never tried to be achievable.\"</p> <p>Publishers hope their own aspirations are more realistic. If they can successfully match their output with changing tastes, they are quietly confident they can ride out the worst of a retail downturn. So far this year book sales are down 1% on 2007, according to book monitor service Nielsen BookScan, although this can largely be attributed to last year's publication of Harry Potter. \"Books are high value but low price,\" says Philip Jones, managing editor of thebookseller.com. \"Everyone is saying that books are recession proof, and so far nothing's happened to disprove that.\"</p>",

It faces serious competition in the festive market from the Apple phone and two other recently announced touchscreen devices: the G1, which has Google's Android software and is exclusive to T-Mobile, and the 5800 XpressMusic from Nokia, which Orange confirmed yesterday it will be offering, although it is unclear if it will be out by Christmas. </p> <p>But Jens Schulte-Bockum, Vodafone's global head of terminals, has no doubt of the BlackBerry Storm's potential. \"This will be one of the best sellers if not the bestseller in the contract market for Christmas,\" he said. \"We have very aggressive plans for it.\"</p> <p>\"I see this as a mainstream product in the consumer market,\" added Nick Read, who heads Vodafone in the UK but will shortly move to run its Asian businesses. \"You have all the robustness of BlackBerry but with multi-media and you have a touchscreen that actually works for texting and email. From my perspective, this is really meeting the needs of a more sophisticated consumer.\"</p> <p>Vodafone asked BlackBerry to come up with an exclusive device about a year ago, after it failed to secure an exclusive deal for the iPhone in any of its markets. But the Storm is not just an iPhone look-a-like. In dumping its trademark keypad, BlackBerry has developed a touchscreen that prevents a user making the sort of slip-up that is all too easy with competing devices of 'accidentally' clicking on a link or phone number by merely navigating the screen by touch.</p> <p>The whole touchscreen on the Storm is one large mouse button, so touching a button or key is not enough to activate any function - the user needs to press down on the item to set it off. In the past, business users have held off using touchscreen devices because of what RIM co-chief executive, Mike Lazaridis, describes as \"this problem where navigation and confirmation were inter-mingled in the same action\".</p> <p>Vodafone has been allowing pre-registration for the device on its UK website and is already getting 1,000 applications a day.</p> <p>Some analysts are likely to question the advisability of launching such a high-end device in the current market conditions, but Read is undeterred.</p> <p>\"There are certain sectors, such as financial services, where there will be job losses and they all have BlackBerrys so there will be a degree of loss there,\" he said. \"But it is so outweighed by the potential to go down into small business and consumer.\"</p> <p>The Storm contract is cheaper than both the G1, which T-Mobile is expected to make free for anyone on a \u00a340 a month deal, and the iPhone, which O2 gives away free with a \u00a345 a month contract. But both T-Mobile and O2 only tie-in customers for 18 months, whereas Vodafone demands they sign up for two years.</p>",
  "<p>For once no one is going to argue with the Prime Minister. We are indeed in \"extraordinary times\", as Gordon Brown said this morning.</p> <p>So extraordinary that the massive bail-out of Britain's banks has done nothing to stop the wave of selling in the market.</p> <p>Not even all the bank shares are heading north, despite the hefty handout from the government. It is making \u00a350bn available to eight of the UK's largest banks and building societies, another \u00a3200bn for short term borrowing to provide liquidity and a special company to provide up to \u00a3250bn in loan guarantees.</p> <p>Now all we need is a cut in UK interest rates of up to 100 basis points from the Bank of England, today or tomorrow.</p> <p>So after yesterday's unprecedented plunges in banking shares<strong>, HBOS</strong> has recovered 22% to 114.7p. But at the moment it is on its own.</p> <p>After an earlier rise, <strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong> is now down 3.5p at 86.5p, and <strong>Barclays</strong> is down 7% at 264p after it said it would participate in the scheme.</p> <p>Chris Hossian of spread betters ODL Securities said: \"Whilst the first move is not always the right move, the initial reaction of the market to the rescue package has been lukewarm. Whilst the package has been welcomed, the response appears to be muted at present. One has to be concerned that we have not seen all of yesterdays losses recovered.\"</p> <p>Of course, with Wall Street dropping 5% overnight and the Japanese market down more than 9%, the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> was always going to be under pressure. So it has proved, and the index is now 183.6 points lower at 4421.6. </p> <p>Supermarket group <strong>J.Sainsbury</strong> has slumped after it warned in what was an otherwise in-line trading statement that the economic environment would remain tough. It is now down 34.5p at 279.25p.</p> <p>Miners are also lower as demand fears re-emerge. <strong>Kazakhmys</strong> is down 42p at 371.5p while <strong>Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation</strong> has lost 41.25p to 418.5p.</p> <p>Publisher <strong>Reed Elsevier</strong> has lost 37.5p to 500.5p on reports that bidders for its business to business magazine division might be going cold on the deal.</p> <p>Collins Stewart said: \"Although three bidders are sill reported to be interested, the staple finance package arranged by Reed to help bidders finance the deal is apparently at risk, with two of the seven banks possibly unable to participate. Whilst we think a failure to complete may be bad for sentiment, it doesn't unsettle our valuation, nor our buy case.\"</p> <p>Pubs group <strong>Mitchells &amp; Butler</strong> fell 11.5p to 152p on reports Robert Tchenguiz had sold its stake.</p> <p>Mark Brumby of Blue Oar Securities said: \"Having spoken to M&amp;B, the company has yet to formally confirm this but we believe it to be true. If the stake has gone to a high net worth individual, as some are suggesting, this is not quite as helpful as if it had been normalized via an institutional placing. \"</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>9am:</strong> The prime minister is giving a press conference in Downing Street at 9.15am. He will be appearing with Alistair Darling, the chancellor, and it will give both men the chance to explain and defend their banking bail-out. I'll be live blogging as soon as it starts.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>9.25am:</strong> Before the press conference starts, I've just been reading the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/oct/08/creditcrunch.banking1\">Treasury statement about the bail-out.</a> For anyone still confused about what this means, it's worth pointing out that there are three parts to the package - with three chunks of money attached:</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p>1. Extending the government's special liquidity scheme, (ie making money available for banks to borrow) - \"at least \u00a3200bn\" is available.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p>2. Buying shares in banks (to provide them with extra capital) - at total of \u00a350bn available, \u00a325bn in the first tranche and then another \u00a325bn available later.</p> <p>3. A lending guarantee (ie, a promise that if banks lend to each other, and one of them goes bust, the lender won't lose money) - expected to be worth \u00a3250bn.</p> <p>I've been a journalist for almost 20 years. I've never seen a government press release with such enormous figures in it.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>9.25am:</strong> Brown is here. He says extraordinary times call for \"bold, far-reaching solutions\".</p> <p>The stability and restructring programme is \"comprehensive, specific and it breaks new ground\".</p> <p>While over the last year the government has acted to strengthen the system, ministers started work on this package some weeks ago.</p> <p>No one measure alone will be sufficient.</p> <p>This is not a time for \"out-dated thinking or conventional dogma\". It needs an innovative approach.</p> <p>Brown is now running through the three main points I outlined earlier.</p> <p>On buying shares, he says the government is determined that UK banking should be \"strong and secure\".</p> <p>On the lending guarantee, he says this will be offered for a \"fully commercial fee\". It will earn a \"proper return\".</p> <p>The measures should allow banks to return to their \"proper function\".</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>9.25am:</strong> The government is also taking legal action against the Icelandic authorities to help pay for compensation to those who lost money through Icesave.</p> <p>Because the economy should be built around the work-ethic, the government will also need to be satisfied that dividend payments and bank salaries are satisfactory.</p> <p>Because these are global problems, global action is required. This is a \"long haul\". Brown says he has spoken to Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, this morning about a coordinated EU response.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>9.30am:</strong> Brown invites Darling to add to his statement. Darling says we are going through a period of \"extraordinary turbulence in every part of the world\".</p> <p>The government wanted to \"stabilise the position\", help banks build up their capital position and make it easier for banks to lend to each other. If banks lend to each other, they can then lend to us \"as businesses, individuals and so on\".</p> <p>Darling says, as he's said before, he will continue to do \"whatever it takes\" to stablise the banking system.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>9.35am:</strong> Darling weighs in. He said that although the government lend money to Northern Rock, more than half of that has now been repaid.</p> <p>On the special liquidity scheme, Darling says the money is being lent and will be repaid. The shares are being bought and will be sold in due course. And the lending guarantee is on commercial terms.</p> <p>Robinson says they are implying it's cost-free. He says that, if it was so easy, why wasn't it done before.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>9.35am:</strong> Darling says: \"The government, of course, funds these things through borrowing ..... Frankly, only a government can do this.\"</p> <p>An ITN journalist asks why the government won't guarantee savings.</p> <p>Brown says \"every time a bank has been in difficulty we have made sure that depositors have been safe\". The government has done this with Northern Rock, Bradford &amp; Bingley and Icesave.</p> <p>The government could have just provided more liquidity, or could have done what the Americans did, and bought up bad assets. But it took a different approach because it wanted to deal with the short-term problems and the long-term problems too.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>9.40am:</strong> Brown says he is also insisting that he will be satisfied about \"executive renumeration\" ie, bonuses. Others might want to ask about this, he says. That means he's dying to say more about it.</p> <p>Andy Bell from Five News takes the bait. He asks Brown what he thinks about the way the banks have run their businesses.</p> <p>Where people work hard and are responsible, they should be rewarded, Brown says. But not when they are irresponsible and put the whole system at risk. That's why he's insisting that \"renumeration ... is on the agenda\". He goes on: \"There are strings attached.\" But does this mean no bonuses? Or just smaller ones?</p> <p>Gary Gibbon from Channel 4 wants to know: \"Who is to blame?\"</p> <p>Brown says it started in America.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>9.40am:</strong> Some banks did not know what risks they were taking on. There was \"a failure of responsibility\". He says the Financial Services Authority has already said it could have done some things better.</p> <p>People want to know that the banks will do the jobs for which they are intended, he says.</p> <p>British banks have had \"a great record in the past\". \"We are going to ensure that the problems ... are solved.\"</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>9.40am:</strong> Joey Jones from Sky says Brown seems to think he can \"walk away from the wreckage ... smelling of roses\".</p> <p>Brown says he does not accept that he was to blame. He says he has \"led the world today\" with his plans. Other countries may want to follow what the Treasury is doing.</p> <p>James Landale from the BBC wants to know what's Plan B. What will happen if this doesn't work?</p> <p>Brown says his plan his more ambitious than people expected. He will do whatever it takes to ensure stability.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>9.45am:</strong> Ben Brogan from the Daily Mail asks about risk. If the \u00a3250bn is being lent against \"dodgy assets\", there must be a risk?</p> <p>Darling says there will be a commercial fee for these guarantees.</p> <p>(By the way, where's Robert Peston? Are they allowed to hold a press conference without him there?)</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>9.45am:</strong> Brown says we should look at the proposals as a whole.</p> <p>Jon Snow from Channel 4 says that if we are partially nationalising the banks, but not putting anyone on th board or putting anyone in to run them, how will the government ensure they do start lending to each other.</p> <p>Darling says he is not seeking to take public control. On the Today programme this morning he tried to reject the \"part-nationalisation\" label.</p> <p>But I think he's probably too late - all the newspapers are using this formula to describe what's happening this morning.</p> <p>A GMTV journalist asks how worried Brown is about people losing their jobs?</p> <p>Brown says a sound banking system is critical to everyone.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>9.50am:</strong> George Parker from the FT asks Brown to respond to allegations that he should have made the announcement on Monday but that he \"dithered\".</p> <p>Darling said he needed to work the plan through. He says he has made his \"extreme irritation\" at the speculation that emerged on Sunday very clear.</p> <p>But, actually, I don't think he has said that publicly before. He's referring to the Tories, who started calling for a recapitalisation programme at the weekend, apparently in the hope of appearing to be \"ahead of the game\".</p> <p>Brown says it was right to act in a \"calm and orderly way\". The public want to know that \"those who are charged with leadership\" will act in a calm and orderly way.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>9.50am:</strong> A Newsnight journalist asks if Brown and Darling will apologise for the panic over the last 48 hours and the \"silent run on the banks\".</p> <p>Brown rejects the charge. His programme is \"far more comprehensive then ever people were asking for\".</p> <p>Andrew Porter from the Daily Telegraph asks if the removal of the Royal Bank of Scotland board was a condition of the deal.</p> <p>\"Absolutely not,\" says Darling.</p> <p>Patrick Wintour from the Guardian asks why Brown didn't follow the Paulson plan.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>9.55am:</strong> Brown says the Americans do not yet know how much they are going to have to spend on the toxic assets they are committed to buy. He has taken a \"bold and far-reaching decision\".</p> <p>David Stringer from AP asks when Brown will discuss the crisis with G7 colleagues.</p> <p>Brown says he is putting plans about a medium-term funding scheme to EU colleagues. Darling is attending a G7 finance meeting soon and there are plans for a G7 heads of government meeting.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>10.00am:</strong> He has proposals about regulation, supervision, disclosure and transparency.</p> <p>Kitty Donaldson from Bloomberg asks about Darling's Mais lecture tonight and the arrangements for salaries.</p> <p>Darling says he has postponed this evening's Mais lecture in the City.</p> <p>The government will not decide on people's pay. But the FSA is looking at these issues, and particularly the question of incentives.</p> <p>Brown says pay will be an issue in the discussions with banks.</p> <p>A journalist from the Newcastle Journal asks for a guarantee that public spending will not be hit.</p> <p>Brown says his record on public spending is a good one.</p> <p>Catherine Mayer from Time asks if there has been a failure of political leadership.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>10.00am:</strong> Darling says the Americans, like the UK government, have reacted appropriately.</p> <p>A journalist from AFP asks why dividend payments are an issue. If the government is taking shares in banks, then surely it should want dividends to be as high as possible.</p> <p>Good question. Darling says that Brown has covered this already (which he hadn't).</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>10.05am:</strong> Another journalist asks if this marks the death of Brown's fiscal rules.</p> <p>Brown says he wants to put the emphasis on restructuring.</p> <p>James Lyons from the Mirror asks how far through the crisis we are. Another good question.</p> <p>Brown says we are in it for the long-haul.</p> <p>That's it. Darling says he's off to a briefing at the Treasury.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>10.25am:</strong> <strong>Instant summary</strong></p> <p>Brown and Darling both put on a fairly confident performance, all things considered. Brown was very keen to stress the bold and far-reaching nature of his package, which he seems to think will provide a model form of intervention for other countries to follow. For all I know, he may be right. But what was really striking was what he couldn't say, or couldn't answer.</p> <p><strong>The cost:</strong> the Treasury has published the bald figures, but when journalists such as Nick Robinson tried to discover what this would mean for the taxpayer, they drew a complete blank. At the moment Brown and Darling are giving the impression that the Treasury can just whistle up this money from nowhere. I'm no expert on this, and no doubt Larry Elliott will explain all at some point, but I'm pretty sure that the Treasury can't borrow money on this scale without some impact on the public finances.</p> <p><strong>Bonuses and salaries:</strong> Brown was keen to give the impression that there would be a clampdown on bank bonuses, but when Darling was pressed about this he said that the government, even though it is becoming a shareholder in these banks, would not be trying to determine executive salaries. </p> <p>And on bonuses he suggested that the only action that would be taken would be the FSA review already underway intended to ensure that banks that reward excessive risk-taking with big bonuses will have to have more capital in reserve in case things go wrong.</p> <p>The issue of bonuses is a hugely sensitive one (which is why the Tories have been talking it up). I'm pretty sure that when Darling speaks in the Commons, MPs will express real anger about the prospect of executives in part-nationalised banks continuing to pocket huge salaries.</p> <p><strong>Dithering:</strong> Brown said that it was important to proceed in a calm and orderly way. But he did not have a good explanation as to why the government could not have acted on Monday morning, before bank shares went into free-fall, instead of 48 hours later. After all, it's not as if the Treasury hasn't seen this coming.</p> <p><strong>The economy:</strong> How bad is it going to get? Obviously, no one knows. But I'm not sure Brown said anything to make people feel much more confident about it.</p> <p><strong>Bank guarantees:</strong> Brown said that anyone worried about the safety of bank deposits should look at what the government does, not what it says. The decision to reimburse the Icesave savers is a bold one (which will put another black hole in Treasury accounts). But we don't know yet whether it will stop UK investors withdrawing money from UK banks.</p>",
  "<p><strong>October 7 session</strong></p> <p><strong>Baking crisis</strong><br>The Treasury chief secretary, Yvette Cooper, said the government was looking at a \"wide range of options\" to support the banking system. She told MPs: \"At the point at which we think further action is needed and further measures must be introduced we will say so.\"</p> <p>As banks continued to suffer FTSE falls, Cooper refused to discuss a potential recapitalisation programme using taxpayers' money to shore up ailing institutions. She told MPs: \"I think it is irresponsible for people to speculate about particular pros and cons of measures. It is right that we should take measured judgments and do the right thing to support the markets given the instability and the turbulence we have seen.\"</p> <p>Cooper was responding to Tory Bernard Jenkin (Essex N), who said: \"Isn't the urgent priority to recapitalise the banks? That's not going to happen on their own, that is going to require some form of government intervention.\"</p> <p><strong>Fiscal rules</strong><br>The government was accused by the shadow Treasury chief secretary, Philip Hammond, of leaving the country \"ill-prepared\" to face the economic downturn by breaking its fiscal rules. He said that by failing to \"put something aside in the good years\", ministers were now prevented from doing more to help hard-pressed families and businesses. Calling for a new fiscal framework, he warned: \"We have been living beyond our means, both as a nation and individually, and now the day of reckoning is coming.\"</p> <p><strong>European council meeting</strong><br>Next week's European council meeting will focus on tackling the global economic crisis rather than issues surrounding the Lisbon treaty, David Miliband said. The foreign secretary will attend the meeting in Brussels with Gordon Brown next Wednesday and Thursday and he told MPs the agenda had been significantly altered.</p> <p><strong>Bank deposits</strong><br> The government's refusal to guarantee all bank deposits is \"adding to the pressure\" on the financial system, Tory former cabinet minister Lord Forsyth of Drumlean warned. Labour ex-Treasury chief secretary Lord Barnett urged the government to \"made quite clear that there was no likelihood of any depositor losing any money from any existing banks or building societies\".</p> <p>Lord Davies of Oldham, for ministers, replied: \"There isn't, because our major banks and building societies are entirely secure. It is the case that we have one or two incidences of runs on banks and building societies which did require prompt action that has been carried out.\"</p> <p><strong>Afghanistan</strong><br>Britain would back efforts to negotiate with elements of the Taliban in Afghanistan but only if they renounce violence, Foreign Office minister Bill Rammell said. He told MPs he would support Afghan efforts to reach out to Taliban elements if they were \"genuinely prepared\" to leave the insurgency and engage in the political process.</p> <p>Asked about comments from Britain's most senior officer in Afghanistan that the war in the country was unwinnable, Rammell said Britain could defeat the Taliban from \"usurping the legitimate will of the Afghan people\".</p> <p><strong>Nato membership for Georgia and Ukraine</strong><br>Miliband defended the government's stance on Nato membership for Georgia and Ukraine, saying it was up to sovereign nations to decide what organisations they wanted to belong to. The foreign secretary told MPs that both Nato and the EU had \"very clear criteria\" for membership that should not be applied \"with fear or with favour\".</p> <p><strong>Iran</strong><br>The UK is \"very concerned\" about Iran's nuclear ambitions and human rights record, Miliband said. Tehran's uranium enrichment programme represents a serious threat to security in the Middle East and the wider world, he told MPs. The government was continuing to press for oil and gas sanctions.</p> <p><strong>Injuries to soldiers serving in Iraq and Afghanistan</strong></p> <p>A total of 50 soldiers have suffered amputations as a result of service in Iraq and Afghanistan since April 2006, defence minister Kevan Jones said. He disclosed that 34 military patients from Afghanistan and 16 from Iraq had endured \"either a traumatic or surgical amputation\" - ranging from the loss of part of a finger or toe to the loss of one or more entire limbs - between April 2006 and August this year.</p> <p><strong>Welfare reform</strong><br>The shadow work and pensions secretary, Chris Grayling, told the house: \"People up and down the country are worried about their jobs and their businesses and about the future and the worry is that this government has been complacent about unemployment.\" The way forward was to \"accelerate\" the process of welfare reform by introducing \"innovative employment programmes\" to help match people and their skills.</p> <p>The work and pensions secretary, James Purnell, said: \"We have a strong and flexible labour market and it is indeed one of the best in the G7.\" The UK had the second highest employment rate in the G7 and there were 600,000 vacancies in the economy. He added: \"What we should all be doing is focusing on exactly what we can do to make sure that people find their next job as fast as they can as well as protecting existing jobs.\"</p> <p><strong>Local council elections</strong></p> <p>Moves to shift next year's council elections from May 7 to June 4 - the same day as the European parliament contests - were launched by the government. After a consultation on ministers' proposals, local government minister John Healey said: \"Avoiding elections on two separate occasions within a month will be more convenient for voters, less costly for the taxpayer and more efficient for electoral administrators.\"</p>",
  "<p>Asia's battered markets plunged for a fifth straight today following yet more turmoil on Wall Street, with the Japanese market plummeting to its lowest level since the stockmarket crash of October 1987.</p> <p>By the end of a torrid trading session in Tokyo, the benchmark Nikkei 225 index was down by 952.58 points to 9203.32, a fall of more than 9%. </p> <p>The US bail-out package, a string of bank rescues and sustained injections of extra funds by central banks around the world have failed to ease fears that there is no way out of the current crisis, analysts said.</p> <p>\"Amid deepening uncertainty over the course of the financial crisis and worries over a slowdown in the global economy, investors simply don't find incentives to buy stocks,\" said Kabuki Miyazawa, a market analyst at Daiwa Securities SMBC.</p> <p>\"Selling seems almost unstoppable because of uncertainty over the crisis.\"</p> <p>On Wall Street the Dow Jones industrial average lost more than 5 % on Tuesday, despite attempts by the US Federal Reserve to ease the credit crisis.

  "<p>Town hall meetings have been feted as the arena in which <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/2008/06/04/mccain-town-hall/\">John McCain excels</a> and so it was expected that he would breeze through <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/08/uselections2008.johnmccain1\">last night's presidential debate in Nashville</a>. As it turned out, however, McCain's prowess was slightly overrated as Barack Obama proved that he too can fare very well in a town hall environment. </p> <p>On the basis of the dramatic economic events that have taken place since the last time McCain and Obama came face to face, McCain was under the most pressure to impress, in order to <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/111004/Gallup-Daily-9Point-Obama-Lead-Ties-Campaign-High.aspx\">bridge the polling gap</a> that has opened up between himself and his opponent. While he wasn't bad, he certainly wasn't brilliant enough to give him any significant advantage over Obama. <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/10/07/cnn-poll-obama-won-the-night/\">Post-debate polls</a> are already showing that Obama \u2013 who appeared more composed and collected than McCain and displayed a real sense of knowledge and gravitas \u2013 is well ahead.</p> <p>Considering the different physical setting of the debate \u2013 including the candidates' ability to move around and engage directly with the audience \u2013 Obama's and McCain's stylistic, body language and generational differences were much more obvious tonight, and will no doubt play a much larger role in determining who voters believe won the debate. </p> <p>The ability to connect with voters was important for both candidates and in that respect McCain was physically clearly at ease with the audience. Whilst not quite as folksy as Sarah Palin, he often addressed the audience using the somewhat forced expression \"my friends\" and went to some lengths to repeat the names of the individuals who had asked questions, standing closer to them than Obama and even shaking hands with one. Making McCain appear amiable, this was a tactic that will no doubt go down well with Republican voters.</p> <p>However, McCain's physical closeness was at odds with a disconnect revealed not only by his jokes about needing a hair transplant (which was met with silence) or the obvious disdain directed towards Obama \u2013 who he <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/blogs/campaignmatters/369738/not_the_senator_but_that_one\">at one point addressed as \"that one\"</a> \u2013 but also by his statement that members of the audience may never have heard of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac before last week \u2013 highly unlikely considering that they are two of America's largest mortgage providers. </p> <p>Obama, although physically more distant from the audience, did an excellent job at connecting in a more down-to-earth, in touch and less forced way than McCain by making clear references to the experiences of middle class people, and directing his key points on issues back to their specific and practical impact on average Americans. On healthcare, for example, he shared his own experience \u2013 one that is not uncommon in America - of how his mother, dying from cancer had to \"spend the last months of her life in the hospital room arguing with insurance companies\" over whether they would pay for her treatment.</p> <p>The different standpoints of both candidates were more obvious than ever last night, and they both had different degrees of effectiveness in delivering their take on the issues, with Obama certainly doing better in continuing his effective strategy of <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/askfactcheck/is_it_true_john_mccain_voted_with.html\">linking McCain to President Bush</a>, which he did several times, even referring, for example, to \"Senator McCain's and George Bush's foreign policy\" as if they had created it together.</p> <p>McCain's strategy was to focus mainly on talking points, continually bringing the questions back to energy, tax, earmarks and his ability to \"reach across the aisle\". However, with the economy and other such practical issues at the forefront of the minds of American voters, specifics were important tonight. On this aspect, Obama was a clear winner, giving some very solid, well constructed answers on the key points such as healthcare \u2013 which he believes should be a \"right\" for all Americans - Iraq and energy.</p> <p>Anyone who says that Obama is unable to square up to McCain was certainly proven wrong. McCain insisted \u2013 as he has done for some time and as Sarah Palin did in her debate with Joe Biden last week \u2013 on repeating his misrepresentation of Obama's position on taxes. But Obama \u2013 when moderator Tom Brokaw would allow him the opportunity to rebut McCain's points \u2013 fought back, laying out exactly where McCain was incorrect.</p> <p>More vigorously than ever, Obama also delivered some excellent smack-downs to McCain. On McCain's assertions of Obama's apparent naivet\u00e9 he asserted: \"Well, you know, Senator McCain, in the last debate and today, again, suggested that I don't understand. It's true. There are some things I don't understand. I don't understand how we ended up invading a country that had nothing to do with 9/11, while Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida are setting up base camps and safe havens to train terrorists to attack us.\" On McCain's suggestion that Obama is, as Obama himself put it, \"spouting off\", he said: \"[McCain] is the guy who sang, \"Bomb, bomb, bomb Iran,\" who called for the annihilation of North Korea. I don't think that is an example of speaking softly.\"</p> <p>McCain, who repeated the motto \"record over rhetoric\" several times, delivered some optimistic rhetoric of his own, declaring \u2013 somewhat bizarrely - \"I'll get Osama bin Laden, my friends. I'll get him. I know how to get him.\" Of course, he didn't quite divulge how he would do that.</p> <p>Overall, John McCain was not bad, but \u2013 unfortunately for him \u2013 he just wasn't great.</p>",
  "<p>In preparation for the Tokyo Games Show, I've had the opportunity to learn first-hand about trends in the Japanese gaming industry from one of the leading lights in the field: Ricky Tanimoto, Global Marketing and Strategic Planning Manager from <a href=\"http://www.enterbrain.co.jp\">Enterbrain</a>, publishers of the world-famous gaming magazine <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famitsu\">Famitsu</a>. Over lunch with Ricky and the UKTI yesterday - who organised the meeting - I gleaned some key facts about the difference between the UK's industry and the industry here.<br><br><strong> Handhelds dominate</strong><br>The numbers don't lie: it's all about portability. Yesterday, on the way to an early-morning visit to the Tsukiji Central Fish Market, I witnessed this firsthand: a PSP on my left, a DS on my right and a mobile phone across from me. They are pervasive and they are the most important gaming machines in this market. Why? Well, they're ubiquitous. PSP is the current leader in the dedicated games console space, but only by a sheet of rice paper, and Ricky says that's specifically because of the massive success of <a href=\"http://www.capcom.co.jp/monsterhunter/P/\">Monster Hunter</a> which single-handedly took the console from zero to hero.</p> <p>Mobile phones do everything here, from e-commerce to rides on the Tokyo Metro. Downloading is a way of life, and along with animated sequences and other mobile-specific content form the web, games are just part of the package.</p> <p><strong>The PS3 is a European console</strong><br>The biggest surprise over lunch was to discover that the PS3 is a non-player in Japan, and that the company has made a very explicit move to direct its content towards the European market rather than the home team. And what was the key to its success there? Apparently SingStar. Who'd have thought it?</p> <p><strong>There's no PC market</strong><br>There is no PC market here. People are more likely to access their web content from their phones, casual games live on the DS or on their mobiles and there's no MMO culture - despite the valiant efforts of the Korean publishers, who've repeatedly attempted to break this market - and the prevalence of RPGs in its output.</p> <p>Social virtual worlds and other social network services, however, are rising stars. This space is as vibrant as the European and North American markets (if not led by them, but that's my own conjecture), and the leaders at the minute are <a href=\"http://www.secondlife.com\">Second Life</a> and <a href=\"http://mixi.jp/\">Mixi</a>. That SL's mobile phone version is being <a href=\"http://secondlife.reuters.com/stories/2007/02/08/comverse-demos-second-life-on-mobile-phones/\">spearheaded by Japanese companies</a> is not a surprise, considering the importance of this platform for this country.</p> <p><strong>The user-generated content scene is on the rise</strong><br>As well as being as excited about Little Big Planet as I am (new and exciting stuff on that before the game is launched on 24th October!), Ricky assured me that user-generated content in games is in its infancy but likely to rise over the next five years. We'll be moving away from physical products, and the console leaders will be the pipelines through which content can be uploaded and downloaded, kind of like iTunes is to music, in the next five years.</p> <p><strong>If you want to make it in Japan, you've got to commit to Japan</strong><br>Again and again I'm hearing that the japanese business system is dominated by relationships developed through a combination of persistence and patience. One of the most important parts of breaking this market is to commit to the region by setting up shop and having loads of face time. </p> <p>And, according to Ricky and the Japanese UKTI team here, this is why didn't Microsoft's Xbox360 make it in Japan. Sure, they had an office, and sure, some of the development houses were working on Microsoft products, but every decision had to be made by home office in Seattle. The lack of autonomy, and the associated lack of support, turned the developers off, and thus they lost one of the most important markets in the world.</p> <p><strong>Japan's not short of ideas; it's short of technology</strong><br>Just a glance at the streets of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/gamesblog/2008/oct/07/games.events\">Akihabara</a> suggests that the Japanese games industry's creative cup overfloweth. Creatively, Japan reaches heights that we can't even imagine; the breadth of content is overwhelming.</p> <p>But technologically, the realisation of ideas is underwhelming. Apparently - and counter-intuitively - Japan is not a rich games tech producer. The UK on the other hand - with its strong middleware and toolkit development history - is very much on the radar for Japanese companies seeking a conduit for their creativity. Hello opportunity. </p> <p><strong>It's all about the game</strong><br>The centre of the media future in Japan is the game. Over the next five years, the satellites of social network services, interactive TV, music, video, telephony and communication will overlap, but the cruz - the most important interactive component -will be the game. How (and if) that translates to the UK market is debatable; if anything, social networking will be the key to true convergence in that space. But it remains that gaming is at the centre of the Japanese universe. And what an exciting universe it is.</p>",
  "<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338380886\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/10/8/1223434817234/nashville2.jpg\" alt=\"Obama and McCain debate\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: Matthew Cavanaugh/EPA</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Evening all. Oddly, if Barack Obama and John McCain were closer in the polls, there might actually be less riding on tonight's debate in Nashville, Tennessee; as things stand, it's crucial. Naturally, I say this partly in an unashamed attempt to get you excited about tonight's liveblogging blogstravaganza, starting here at about <strong>8.45pm eastern time/1.45am UK time</strong>. But it's true: now that Obama has a <a href=\"http://blog.newsweek.com/blogs/stumper/archive/2008/10/07/how-was-kerry-doing-four-years-ago-nowhere-near-as-well-as-obama.aspx\">significant and sustained lead in the polls</a>, tonight could be McCain's best remaining opportunity to turn things round. And the town hall format, which involves questions from the audience, is where he's thus far been strongest: that's why he originally <a href=\"http://voices.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2008/06/04/mccain_challenges_obama_to_10.html\">challenged Obama to join him in 10 such events</a>. But that was then.</p> <p>McCain is in a quandary. The general wisdom holds that going relentlessly negative and personal against Obama is his best hope; he needs to change the nature of the race at the national level now, not make piecemeal advances in swing states. (And of course, relentless negativity is exactly what his campaign <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics/AP/story/715637.html\">has been doing</a>.) But going personal and negative is hard in this kind of setting, even when there isn't an economic meltdown you ought to be addressing instead: it's too intimate; your rival's right beside you, so you end up looking mean; plus, it's much harder to <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/2008/10/02/2008-10-02_sarah_palin_ignores_questions_she_doesnt.html\">do a Sarah Palin</a> and ignore the question when it's coming from a voter, not a member of the Notoriously Liberal Media. Every time McCain himself goes negative, he imperils his cultivated bipartisan image; besides, it was his perceived contemptuousness on stage that seems to have helped voters decide that <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/09/27/debate.poll/\">Obama won the first face-off</a>. (Will J-Mac even manage to look at Obama tonight? Or will he surprise us all, the old maverick, by trying to go ostentatiously \"presidential\"?) Obama has his own challenges, though they're less acute: he has to decide how much to attack, as against trying to stay above the fray in an effort to nurture his lead in the polls, and hold off on \"lawyerly\" answers and condescension.</p> <p>The <strong>format</strong>: Under the terms of a <a href=\"http://www.suntimes.com/news/sweet/1204162,CST-NWS-sweet06.article\">preposterous 31-page Memorandum of Understanding</a>, the candidates will perch on stools reminiscent of the comedy shows of the late <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Allen_(comedian)\">Dave Allen</a>, six feet apart; they can roam the stage, but mustn't leave their \"designated area\" marked on the carpet. The NBC host Tom Brokaw will moderate, picking questions from a pool 150 undecided voters from the Nashville area, pre-selected by Gallup so that they're demographically representative and so you don't get any of those ghastly ranting eccentrics you get on <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/news/anyquestions.shtml\">Any Answers</a>. The live questioners will ask their questions directly, and Brokaw will intersperse them with selections from a reported six million others received by email. (Brokaw's inbox is a nightmare, I'm telling you.) Cameras aren't allowed to show the reactions of the live questioners -- just their initial questions. Earlier today, I chatted with Paul Kirk, co-chair of the Commission on Presidential Debates, which organises these events, <em>because that's the kind of well-connected person I am</em>, and he fleshed out the procedures: \"Only Tom Brokaw has an inkling of the questions that will be asked. He'll identify a person and call on them; the questioner will ask the question, then be seated. The candidate to whom the question was posed will have two minutes to respond, then the other candidate will have two minutes. Then there'll be one minute of open discussion\" -- but not including the original questioner. (Kirk also said of this year's debate moderators that \"their egos are not without size,\" and confessed to \"pre-game jitters\" before each debate, so there's my scoop of the night thankyouverymuch.) I'll welcome suggestions for the rules of tonight's <strong>drinking game</strong>, though by now I hope you've figured out that it's really just an excuse to drink beer while I work. The tipple of choice here at Guardian Election Central this evening is <a href=\"http://www.bluemoonbrewery.com/\">Blue Moon Brewery Harvest Moon Pumpkin Ale</a>. You may compliment my beer choice in the comments. Cast your vote for drunkenness, here from <strong>8.45pm eastern</strong>!</p> <p><strong>8.49pm</strong> (all times eastern): Tom Brokaw's now introducing himself to the audience and requesting that they act with \"deportment\", explaining that he won't tolerate \"outbursts.\" The invited guests are sitting on blocks of seats in a horsehoe shape, with the candidates' seats in the gap. By the way, I ought to have informed you that the venue tonight, Belmont University, a Christian college in Tennessee, boasts among its <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont_University#Notable_alumni\">alumni </a>Lee Ann Womack, Trisha Yearwood and Brad Paisley. Yes, we're in country country...</p> <p><strong>8.57pm</strong>: Some good drinking-game suggestions in comments. I particularly like RachelINLondon's \"reach across the aisle\", and of course McCain's personal tic, \"my friends\". (Remember also that Obama announces major policy changes by saying \"as I've said before\"...)</p> <p><strong>9.00pm</strong>: Here we go. Brokaw introduces. I think he thinks he's a pretty great guy, you know. And here are our friends Mr Obama and Mr McCain. They shake hands; this time they <em>both</em> do the alpha-male hand-on-the-other's-forearm thing. Obama answers first, on the basis of a coin flip. A man called Alan Shaffer wants to know how the ordinary victims of the economic crisis will be \"bailed out.\" Obama didn't stay long on his stool, if he sat there at all; he goes straight into an attack on the Bush administration, then sets out his \"rescue package for the middle classes\". Hmm, I just tried a bit of this beer \u2014 it's not as good as the Brooklyn Brewery IPA from last week, I have to say. </p> <p>McCain thanks Brokaw and Belmont and gives a sort of strange twitchy thanks to Obama, though it's not clear whether he actually looked at him. I rather think he didn't. He makes a somewhat forced half-joke about Obama not accepting his earlier town hall invitations, then responds Palinistically, diving into energy independence. \"My friends\" twice in one answer: drink! Brokaw asks him who he'd appoint as Treasury secretary. \"Not you, Tom,\" McCain says. Aaaand we have our first bafflingly strange answer of the evening.</p> <p><strong>9.11pm</strong>: A young man named Oliver Clark who asks a fairly similar question to the last one, about the fate of ordinary people in the meltdown. But it's a better question, because the questioner's name is Oliver: now there's a name that says wit, intelligence and all-round accomplishment! McCain strides over and stares at him, condescendingly suggesting he might never have heard of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac before the crisis. He blames Obama's \"cronies and his friends in Washington\" for the problem. And he refers back to Alan, the first questioner. This could get confusing. Obama: \"I've got to correct a little bit of senator McCain's history, not surprisingly... as recently as March, he bragged about the fact that he is a deregulator.\" He's working hard to stress the McCain/lobbyists link. </p> <p><strong>9.17pm</strong>: McCain: American workers are \"the innocent bystanders in the biggest financial crisis of our time.\"</p> <p><strong>9.18pm</strong>: \"How can we trust either of you with our money when both parties got us into this global economic crisis?\" asks a woman whose name I missed. Good point. Obama calls her cynical, but in a nice Obama way. He says he understands her cynicism. But when Bush came into office, things were better; deficit spending and a skyrocketing national debt are a phenomenon of the last eight years.</p> <p>Ah. Theresa is her name, John McCain reminds me, because he seems to have decided to use every questioner's name many times tonight. He says he's \"reached across the aisle\" \u2014 a drink, you betcha! McCain says Obama's never really opposed the leaders of his party, and dives into his absolute favourite subject ever: earmarks. Including Obama's sickening support of... $3m for an overhead projector for a planetarium in Chicago! Scandalous. Although presumably overhead projectors in planetaria aren't the normal kind that you use in presentations at work. I'd imagine they are actually fairly pricey. [I was racing so fast during this whole stretch that I didn't even mention McCain's <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/marketsNews/idUSN0748978520081008\">newsmaking notion</a> that the government should buy up bad mortgages.]</p> <p>Hey! On social security, McCain just \"sat down across the table\" and \"reached across the aisle\" almost at exactly the same time! That's like Cirque du Soleil or something. (Do they have contortionists? I don't recall.)</p> <p><strong>9.26pm</strong>: Brokaw, who's ticking the candidates off repeatedly for overshooting their one-minute followups, asks the ridiculous question about which of the major policy areas they'd prioritise, since money will be so short. No candidate will ever answer in an ordered list... although Obama seems to be doing so -- energy then healthcare then social security and Medicare. Really? Maybe he was just enumerating them.<br> <strong>9.29pm</strong>: First internet question: \"ECONOMIC CRISIS WTF!!1! LOL kthxbye.\" No, not really. The first internet question is from a \"child of the depression\", who wants to know when Americans are going to be asked to make sacrifices. McCain: earmarks earmarks overhead projector earmarks. Obama begins his reply, unexpectedly, with 9/11, and how Bush asked Americans to \"go out and shop\". That wasn't the kind of service people felt called to then, he says, and talks about the Peace Corps. The uncommitted Ohio voters on CNN's bottom-of-the-screen crawl are loving it.</p> <p><strong>9.35pm</strong>: A question on how to break America's bad habit of debt and credit. McCain says keeping track of Obama's tax policies is like \"nailing jelly to the wall.\" \"Senator Obama's secret, that you don't know...\" -- sounds ominous... but in fact the answer is to do with the alleged impact of Obama's tax policies on small businesses. McCain promises a $5,000 tax credit to all and sundry. Brokaw is being way too obsessive about trying to hold the candidates to their one-minute follow-ups; Obama wants to respond on taxes but isn't allowed.</p> <p><strong>9.40pm</strong>: Would you give Congress a date to reform social security and Medicare? Obama glides back into the tax message he's trying to hammer home: almost everyone, including most small businesses, won't experience tax cuts under his proposals. \"If you make less than $250,000 a year, you will not see a single dime of your taxes go up.\" McCain: \"<em>I'll</em> answer the question,\" he says, chuckling weirdly. Obama has never taken on his own party, he says again (except, like, denying Hillary Clinton the nomination...) </p> <p><strong>9.45pm</strong>: A question on forcing rapid action on climate change. McCain's answer is a little all over the place, and he seems to miss the questioner's name -- me, too! -- but focuses on the importance of nuclear power, and Obama's alleged opposition to it. Obama: it's an opportunity as well as a crisis -- \"the same way the computer was an engine for economic growth\". \"What's a computer?\" asks McCain. (Joke.) Neither candidate gives much real detail, and certainly not on non-nuclear energy sources.</p> <p>Brokaw is turning into a pompous fool about this one-minute rule thing. McCain wants him to wave at him when his time is up.</p> <p>McCain brings up a Bush/Cheney-backed energy bill \"stuffed full\" of goodies for the oil companies. \"Know who voted for it? That guy,\" he says, not looking at Obama. \"Know who voted against it? I did...\" Deeply unappealing body language. [Correction: Apparently he said \"that one\".]</p> <p><strong>9.52pm</strong>: Obama is answering a good question on whether healthcare should be treated as a commodity at all, and <em>McCain is just randomly wandering around the stage</em>. As that internet questioner didn't say earlier: WTF? (PS. Have we only had one internet question out of 6m so far?) McCain's long answer, setting out his healthcare policy in the usual terms, ends by bringing up \"hair transplants\". He \"jokes\" that he might need one of those! Ha ha ha! Yeah, me too actually. </p> <p>Brokaw asks if healthcare is a right, a privilege or a responsibility. McCain: a responsibility. Obama: a right. (Body language observation: unlike McCain, when Obama attacks his rival, accusing him of opposing expansion of healthcare insurance for children, he turns to him.) Obama's explaining now why McCain's cross-state health insurance policy wouldn't work.</p> <p>McCain has been tweaking Obama for the last few minutes about the fines he says would be involved in enforcing Obama's mandatory health insurance. As Brokaw tries to move on to foreign policy, he turns to the audience and says \"Did we hear the size of the fine?\" and does a funny little hand gesture plus chuckle. Very offputting. Nobody else laughs, perhaps because Brokaw has told them not to, or perhaps because McCain's not actually being funny.</p> <p><strong>10.00pm</strong>: McCain repeats his \"Senator Obama doesn't understand\" motif. Obama: \"It's true, there are some things I don't understand \u2014 I don't understand how we ended up invading a country that had nothing to do with 9/11,\" starving resources from fighting al-Qaeda. A good answer on Iraq from Obama.</p> <p><strong>10.05pm</strong>: Brokaw wants the two candidates to describe their personal doctrines on the use of force for humanitarian purposes. Obama brings up the Holocaust and the Rwandan genocide as incontrovertible examples of the morality of intervention. McCain: \"Let me just follow up, my friends\" -- yeah, drink, whatever. McCain says following Obama's proposals on Iraq would bring \"our troops home in defeat.\"</p> <p><strong>10.09pm</strong>: The Pakistan border question, from one Katie Hamm: should America respect Pakistan's sovereignty, or chase enemies across the border from Afghanistan as necessary, as in Cambodia? Obama answers a mainly different question: bringing the focus back from Iraq to Afghanistan/Pakistan. </p> <p>McCain recalls his \"hero\", Teddy Roosevelt: \"Speak softly and carry a big stick\", ie, don't announce your plans to invade Pakistan, like Obama allegedly suggested. (And, uh, Sarah Palin, I seem to recall?) But wait -- a few moments ago McCain's \"hero\" was Reagan. Which is it? A nation wants to know.</p> <p>Another tussle on follow-up questions. Obama: \"Can I have a followup?\" McCain, looking genuinely irritated: If Obama gets a followup, \"I'll want a followup, too...\" Obama uses his follow-up to remind everyone of McCain's <em>hilarious</em> \"Bomb Bomb Bomb Iran\" Beach Boys parody hilariousness. McCain seems quite riled. \"I was joking with an old veteran friend about Iran... but the point is, I know how to handle these crises... I'll get Osama bin Laden, my friends, I'll get him. I know how to get him. I'll get him.\" But how? \"I'm not going to telegraph my punches.\" But how? Oh, never mind.</p> <p><strong>10.17pm</strong>: Hurrah! Britain gets a mention, in a Brokaw question. Embarrassingly, it's in the context of the leaked news earlier this week about how the British ambassador to Afghanistan thinks the best that can be hoped for there is an \"acceptable dictator\". McCain says Obama still won't admit the surge in Iraq worked, which is the kind of thing Afghanistan needs, too. The CNN uncommitted-voters-line is flat and unresponsive about this.</p> <p><strong>10.21pm</strong>: Live breaking Guardian commentator news update! Jonathan Freedland texts my colleague Richard Adams to say McCain reminds him of Bob Dole in this debate performance. Oh, the candidates? They're talking about Russia. McCain repeats his anecdote about seeing the letters KGB in Vladimir Putin's eyes, and shortly afterwards stresses that he wouldn't restart the Cold War. He refuses to say whether Russia is an evil empire today.</p> <p><strong>10.25pm</strong>: Terry Shirey, retired Navy officer: \"I know both of you have expressed support for Israel. If despite your best diplomatic efforts, Iran attacks Israel,\" would you send US troops to defend Israel, or wait for the UN? McCain thanks the questioner for his service, repeatedly, and shakes his hand. (I'm pretty sure that breaks the Memo of Understanding, no?) Of course, McCain would not wait for the UN, because they're a bunch of pesky Euro-communists. Whereas Obama, he says, would sit down and negotiate with Iran \"without preconditions\". Oh, we're here again. Is Obama going to try to clarify the difference between preconditions and preparations again? McCain wants to create a League fo Democracies. </p> <p>\"But at the end of the day, my friend, and you know what it's like to serve, and you know what it's like to sacrifice, and you know that we could never allow a second Holocaust.\"</p> <p>Obama thanks Shirey for his service, too, but in a more restrained fashion. Iran must never get a nuclear weapon, he says. He repeats his line that communicating with Iran would enable the US to communicate a dire warning about the consequences of getting one. CNN's Ohio voters seem to like it.</p> <p><strong>10.30pm</strong>: Last question, from Peggy in New Hampshire. \"It has a certain Zen-like quality... what don't you know, and how will you learn it?\" Fantastic question, although a bit Rumsfeldian. Obama says Michelle Obama, who's in the audience, would give a better answer to the question. \"I know I wouldn't be standing here if it wasn't for the fact that this country gave me opportunity... the question in this election is: are we going to pass on that same American dream to the next generation?\" We've seen the dream diminish over the last eight years, he says. (The Ohio women, especially, are loving this part.) \"We can't expect that if we do the same things we've been doing over the last eight years, that somehow we are going to have a different outcome. We need fundamental change...\" He says people will need \"nerve and courage\" to continue \"the extraordinary journey that we call America.\"</p> <p>What McCain doesn't know is \"what's going to happen.\" Er, yes. In the future \"we'll be talking about countries that we hardly know where they are on the map -- some Americans.\" (Spain, perhaps?) \"What I don't know is what the unexpected will be.\" Now <em>that's</em> Zen-like. McCain knows what it's like \"to have your comrades pick you up and out you up in the fight... I'm asking the American people to give me another chance\" to lead it from its current woes. It strikes me that we've heard surprisingly little of McCain's wartime record tonight, relatively speaking.</p> <p>And that's it. Both candidates dive off to do some heavy-duty audience-handshaking, and, finally, with each other, though awkwardly. [Wednesday morning update: actually, the story of the handshake is more complex than this, and I'll blog about it shortly.] As far as I could see, Obama worked the crowd for much longer than McCain. In a Clintonesque refusing-to-leave-the-room fashion, one pundit said.</p> <p><strong>11.40pm update</strong>: The breakdown of my blogging software enables me cunningly to postpone my final judgment until after the results of the CNN and CBS snap polls of debate viewers, both of which say Obama won: CNN by 54% to 30% (with Obama's favourables up and his unfavourables down, both unchanged for McCain); CBS 39% to 27%. <a href=\"http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2008/10/wrapping_up.php\">Matthew Yglesias</a>: \"It's extremely surprising to me, tactically, that McCain didn't try to do something new. Instead, McCain took the same talking points (earmarks bad, tax cuts good, earmarks very bad) that have seen him fall behind and decided to repeat them with less energy.\" </p> <p><a href=\"http://jamesfallows.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/10/your_town_hall_2_debate_wrapup.php\">James Fallows:</a> \"From a horse-race perspective, John McCain came in behind and losing ground, in the middle of a financial/economic panic that works against him, and therefore needing a big win. This meant either damaging and flummoxing Obama, or so outshining him in audience rapport, mastery of policy, and empathetic connection through the camera, that the debate could be presented as a turning point. None of that happened. (McCain's best performance was at the end, rejecting a \"Yes/No\" question on whether Russia is an \"evil empire.\") At this stage in the race, a tie goes to leader, and this was not a tie.\" </p> <p>The conservatives at <a href=\"http://corner.nationalreview.com/\">The Corner</a> are mainly quite depressed, too. Oh, and: <a href=\"http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2008/10/a-new-slogan.html\">that was quick</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/poll/2008/oct/08/uselections2008.debate.obama.mccain\">Now vote in our poll!</a> You know it makes sense.</p> <p><strong>Midnight</strong>: There's a detectible sense among the punditocracy, on television and on the web, that the election might prove to have been decided here tonight. Only a fool would say that outright, of course, so few do, but this wasn't the debate McCain needed: on the one hand, he didn't go for \"presidential\"; on the other hand, he didn't go for \"Bill Ayers\" character attacks like we've heard in Palin's recent stump speeches. A month is an exceptionally long time in politics, etcetera, etcetera. But I don't see how it could have gone much better for Obama, who made no errors, and remained authoratitive and empathetic -- \"presidential\" -- throughout. McCain seemed to try-but-fail to deliver a new and newly detailed economic argument that only ended up <a href=\"http://blogs.forbes.com/trailwatch/2008/10/mccains-big-new.html\">raising more questions</a>; he had at least one incredibly odd moment, calling Obama \"that one\", and more generally his dripping contempt for Obama was as evident as ever. He tried to coax the audience into laughing with him at Obama, which fell flat. To the extent that these things are about the broad-brush impressions that the candidates manage to convey, the impression was that it was Obama who was in command, all the way through.</p> <p>So does this mean McCain gets even more dirty and relentlessly negative from here on in? Would it make any difference if he did? I don't know. My job is to pose rhetorical questions, and then go to bed. Thanks for reading, and please keep commenting...</p>"
