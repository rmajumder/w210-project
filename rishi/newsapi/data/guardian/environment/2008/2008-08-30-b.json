  "<p>When Gordon Brown sits down tomorrow at the conference table with the 26 other EU premiers in the glass-fronted Justus Lipsius building on Brussels's Rue de la Loi, the significance will not be lost on any of those present. The last time they sat in emergency session was in 2001, immediately after al-Qaeda's attack on America. </p> <p>This time, they will be meeting to consider Russia's military actions in response to Georgia's attempt to retake South Ossetia. Those present are likely to agree with British Foreign Secretary David Miliband who declared last week that a new era in international relations was upon us: the post-post Cold War, as former US Secretary of State Colin Powell originally framed it. Russia's intention to absorb both South Ossetia and Abkhazia into the Russian Federation is being treated as a move of that magnitude.</p> <p>History, to reverse Francis Fukuyama's pronouncement on its ending, has decisively begun again. The 'new world order' envisaged in the aftermath of the fall of the Berlin Wall, an order in which liberal democracies would proliferate across the world as the United States exercised a benign global hegemony, has proved to be a mirage. First 11 September and then the debacle of Iraq shattered that happy illusion nurtured in the thinktanks of Washington. </p> <p>Now, in the space of a few weeks, Putin's tanks have buried it once and for all. In the face of protests, exhortations and furious remonstrations, Moscow acted as it saw fit in what it considers the Russian backyard, and damned the consequences, assuming there would be none of any note. This is no unipolar world, designed to Western specifications.</p> <p>In Syria, Libya, even Turkey (a US and European friend) politicians and analysts have noted the consequences of the Georgian crisis - not for what Russia has done but for what the US, EU and Nato have been unable to do: exercise their power to protect an ally.</p> <p>Trading of accusations has accelerated, with Russia's Prime Minister Vladimir Putin charging - in language that would not seemed out of place coming from the lips of dour Soviet Cold War-era Minister for Foreign Affairs, Andrei Gromyko - that the US had armed Georgia for war, and suggesting that US military advisers may have been present during fighting.</p> <p>'I do think this is a pivotal moment,' says Stephen Flanagan of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, 'not least with Russia's rapid recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. It puts into question one of the fundamental assumptions of the post-Cold War era - you don't change borders. Or at least you don't if you're one of the key stakeholders.'</p> <p>Flanagan's assessment is echoed by a senior European diplomat working on the Georgia crisis, who says: 'The widely held view among people who think about these things in Europe as well as Washington, was that Russia was determined to respect borders at the ending of the Soviet Union. That is the major change.'</p> <p>But if there is agreement that one era of diplomacy has passed, there is less agreement over the nature of the new period and how to negotiate its uncertainies.</p> <p>For Ivan Krastev of the Centre for Liberal Strategies - and Republican presidential nominee John McCain's foreign policy adviser, Robert Kagan - the Georgian crisis echoes the power plays of a century ago. 'Europe,' he wrote soon after the fighting, 'has entered a new 19th century, vapourising the end-of-history sentiment that shaped European politics in the 1990s and replacing it with an older, geopolitical calculus in a modern form.'</p> <p>On the surface, at least, the return to gun-boat diplomacy appears confirmed by the spectacle of the warships of five nations cluttering the Black Sea, and US and Russian troops competing over two of Georgia's ports. But if a new Cold War is coming it is clear it will not be much like the old - or even the brief outbreak of conflict in Georgia. With a high oil price, \u00a3300bn in its reserves, European dependency on Russian energy, and wider dependency on Russian co-operation in issues like Iran and the Middle East, Russia is already well-armed with the weapons needed to fight this war. </p> <p>While many analysts have taken the Kagan/Krastev line, others are sceptical of describing the new era solely in terms of a competition between the democracies and the autocracies. Clifford Gaddy of the Brookings Institution, who has met both Putin and George Bush on several occasions, believes that Georgia is a 'turning point' but is more cautious about apportioning the blame entirely on Putin and his vision of Russia.</p> <p>'The Georgia crisis is not unique in itself. It has simply been the event that wakes people up to what has been already happening. I really think that many leaders in the West failed to acknowledge what was happening. I liken it to a financial bubble, and the implicit assumption was that Russia was weak. We considered multiple models for Russia, except for the outcome where Russia became strong and \"bad\" as defined in our terms of 'good' - which means \"like us\". No one considered this outcome because no one imagined oil at over $100 a barrel.'</p> <p>Gaddy also rejects the idea that Russia is trying to re-establish an empire or bring back a Cold War similar in scope to the last. Instead, he sees the current crisis as the inevitable reaction to the experience of Putin and those closest to him over the question of Russia's 'security' during the 1990s - when Russia veered towards becoming a failed state. </p> <p>That concern, existential in Russian society, Gaddy believes was too easily discounted by the West as a rhetorical device of domestic politics: 'Russia in the 1990s was close to being a non-entity. Survival as a grand power was an issue.'</p> <p>Into this was interposed the issue of Nato expansion up to Russia's very borders, sold first by President Bill Clinton and then George Bush, as a mechanism for 'democratisation' that would guarantee security. Gaddy says: 'That push was counter-productive and largely responsible for what is happening today. If we push harder, [as Gordon Brown suggests] it will confirm Russia's worst fear over what Nato is about. That is what I am afraid of - by pushing ever-harder we end up in a dangerous place.'</p> <p>The feeling that the world stands in the midst of a definitive reorganisation is shared in Russia. 'We are on the verge of a new Cold War,' argues Sergei Karaganov, a former adviser to Russian President Boris Yeltsin and now deputy director of the European Studies Institute in Moscow. 'It seems like a Cold War. I can only hope it will not be so deep.'</p> <p>For Karaganov, the conflict between Russia and the West has been an inevitable consequence of a scenario that many American writers have recently turned their attention to - the relative decline in US power and the unipolar world that dominated throughout the 1990s - and the emergence of a multipolar world that US and British foreign policy has been slow to react to and acknowledge. </p> <p>It is not just that the West and the EU has been losing infuence because of mistakes made in places like Iraq, says Karaganov. 'Russia has contributed to what is happening, too, by being too cocky in trying to restore its position in the world too quickly. Not so long ago we were almost a failed state. Now we are one of the world's three big powers again.'</p> <p>There will be much noise generated by tomorrow's meeting in Brussels, the likely outcome is an agreement on a series of minor punishments - not enough to reverse what has happened in Georgia, but enough, it is hoped, to discourage Russia in the future. </p> <p>Among them, it is expected, will be a review of joint Russian-EU partnership agreements; a declaration of support for Georgia's territorial integrity (if not necessarily its President Mikheil Saakashvili, who launched the attack that led to Russia's intervention); and consideration of new visa restrictions for Russians wanting to come into the Schengen Area.</p> <p>What none will be able to ignore, in a grouping that gets almost a quarter of its energy from Russia, is that the EU - like the US - has few weapons in its armoury to punish Russia, except by attempting to shame it at a time when Moscow appears determined not to be embarrassed, its President, Dmitry Medvedev, declaring the country is not afraid of a 'new Cold War'.</p> <p>There are a few unwilling to be drawn into comparisons with the last Cold War. Zbigniew Brzezinski, former National Security Adviser to President Jimmy Carter, now a lecturer in US foreign policy, believes the solution to the crisis lies in old-fashioned capitalist economics, an influence notably absent in the days of the Soviet Union.</p> <p>'It is serious, but it is neither fatal nor tragic. It is serious because Russia is going through a post-imperial crisis of leadership inspired by post-imperial nostalgia. It is not tragic or fatal, because Russia is not the Soviet Union. It is vulnerable, as the flight of capital from its stock market has already shown. </p> <p>'The difference between Stalin and Putin is that Stalin commited great crimes on a great scale. Putin has committed petty crimes on a petty scale. And what is certain is that Russia's new business elite is not going to be happy if they think their bank accounts could be frozen or their children cannot study in the West. What is required is calm, deliberate ostracism.'</p>",
  "<h2>James Yorkston <br>When the Haar Rolls in (Domino) \u00a311.99</h2> <p>Fife folk singer James Yorkston's debut album, Going up Country (2002), outclassed most other 'nu' folk outings of its generation. He lost a little sparkle later, but When the Haar Rolls in - a reference to the local North Sea mist - finds Yorkston back on riveting form. The arrangements thrum with life, invigorating, rather than merely propping up, his rueful songs. Various Watersons are here, sealing his induction into the old folk fold, but it's Yorkston's individuality that beckons on tracks like 'Tortoise Regrets Hare', and the insistent Krautrock rhythms he smuggles into a Lal Waterson cover ('Midnight Feast'). <br><strong>Kitty Empire</strong> </p> <h2>Brett Anderson <br>Wilderness (Drowned In Sound) \u00a39.99</h2> <p>It's a far cry from the shimmying, bum-slapping verve of mid-Nineties Suede but there's something cheeringly familiar about Anderson's second solo album. The mood is sombre, the arrangements spare - Anderson's voice is set to a simple backing of piano and cello - yet his taste for melodrama is undiminished. Wilderness traces the course of a London relationship with observations such as: 'We kneel before the open grave and light the candles with our pain' ('Funeral Mantra'). Though it's occasionally overwrought, he still makes tortured romance seem seductive. <br><strong>Ally Carnwath</strong> </p> <h2>Brian Wilson <br>That Lucky Old Sun (EMI) \u00a312.99</h2> <p>A recreation of Wilson's 2007 concerts, this is a life in five movements. Beginning in 1961, ocean, the Hollywood hills, diners and surfer girls evoke the fantasy landscape of the Beach Boys' early music. Pastiche teeters into heartbreaking candour as lyricist Scott Bennett explores Wilson's mental turmoil on 'Oxygen to the Brain' and 'Midnight's Another Day'. Individually, many of these songs are fun but fairly throwaway, showing little evolution in Wilson's writing. Yet there is still much here to fascinate. Like his life, this is a rich tapestry, ably stitched together with Van Dyke Parks's arrangements and a spoken interlude. <br><strong>Katie Toms</strong> </p> <h2>Miley Cyrus <br>Breakout (Polydor) \u00a312.99</h2> <p>'My parents say that I'm lazy,' Miley Cyrus complains at the start of her new album. She has reason to sound disgruntled. Not only is the 15-year-old daughter of country star Billy Ray Cyrus on album number three, she also stars in a hit Disney TV show, Hannah Montana , the basis for a 3D concert film that cleared up at the US box office last February. Breakout is textbook American teen stuff, confronting heartbreak and dictatorial parents over power chords and pianos. There are a couple of surprises, however, not least 'Wake up America', an unfocused call to her country for action against global warming. <br><strong>Killian Fox</strong> </p> <h2>Giant Sand <br>Provisions (YepRoc) \u00a310.99</h2> <p>As an architect of Americana, Arizona's Howe Gelb, main man of Giant Sand, remains a peripheral figure. His hushed vocals, oblique lyrics and stylistic meandering are, granted, not mainstream material, but an album four years in the making might be more consistent than Provisions . Moments of brilliance include 'Spiral', a stark portrait of a millenarian USA where 'some are hiding in the churches, some are hiding in the gun', while 'Can Do' is a playful Johnny Cash tribute and 'Stranded Pearl' a bleak love song. Elsewhere Gelb's brooding songs oscillate between insight and obfuscation. <br><strong>Neil Spencer</strong> </p> <h2>Freddie Hubbard <br>On the Real Side (Times Square) \u00a313.99</h2> <p>For 10 years, the jazz world believed that Freddie Hubbard would never play again. After suffering horrendous damage to his upper lip in 1991, it seemed that his career as the most dazzling trumpet soloist of his generation was over. But after a cautious return in 2001, with the New Jazz Composers Octet, he slowly rebuilt his technique. Now, at the age of 70, Hubbard sounds like a man reborn. Still with the Octet, and playing the gentler and more mellow flugelhorn, he performs with impressive gravitas and a kind of bruised lyricism. The new version of his piece 'Up Jumped Spring' is simply perfect. <br><strong>Dave Gelly</strong></p>",
  "<p>The managers of Celtic and Rangers tend to spend the days before an Old Firm match trying to reduce the heat in Scottish football's most inflammable fixture. Gordon Strachan and Walter Smith might just as well attempt to douse a forest fire with a water pistol. </p> <p>The latest episode at Celtic Park this afternoon - the first of four in the Premier League this season - is already at the mercy of the feverishness that precedes the game and often lingers for the months until the next confrontation. </p> <p>That Rangers supporters are still suffering the pain of the past two defeats at the same venue, which cost them the championship in the closing stages of last season may deepen the usual intensity, but today's event is also afflicted by a relatively new complication: there is the widespread perception that referees are not only incompetent, but also dishonest. </p> <p>A series of errors by match officials in recent times has been seized on by certain sections of the press, who have filled pages for days at a time highlighting the 'problem', presenting possible 'solutions' and offering angry fans a platform from which to proclaim extreme views. </p> <p>Strachan's show of disdain for the notion that match officials are guilty of anything other than infallibility is a simple expression of praise for those who have taken charge of Old Firm matches during his time at Celtic. 'They have been excellent,' he says. Smith, however, is more expansive and specific in his condemnation of the accusers. 'An awful lot of that stuff about referees recently has been exaggerated,' the Rangers manager says. 'If you look at the game down through the ages, you'll find that referees and linesmen have always made mistakes. But, at present, these incidents have been more highlighted than I can remember. </p> <p>'An Old Firm match is a difficult environment. You've been asking me about the difficulties faced by players going into the game for the first time. Well, it's the same for referees. They're entitled to be nervous.' </p> <p>None of this, of course, is likely to appease anyone who is offended by any mistakes that may be made by today's referee, Dougie McDonald, but this is his third Old Firm match and his previous two have passed without a hint of controversy. </p> <p>Smith, in any case, is much more concerned with ending the mini-series of set-backs his team have experienced on their past two visits to Parkhead. The need for Rangers to dethrone their great rivals has been made even more urgent by last season's late collapse and their ignominious elimination from Europe in the second qualifying round of the Champions League by the largely unconsidered FBK Kaunas of Lithuania. </p> <p>The acquisition of the central defender, Madjid Bougherra, to replace the transferred Carlos Cu\u00e9llar, and of Pedro Mendes and Steven Davis to bring some much-needed flair to midfield has encouraged the belief among the club's followers that a season that had promised only more anguish a few weeks ago could yet be transformed into one of triumph. </p> <p>Smith is too experienced to indulge in such talk, but he is ready to recognise that improvement has been effected. Having been involved in Old Firm matches for the past 22 years - excepting his short spells with Everton and Scotland's national team - he is also aware of their significance. </p> <p>'I don't think it matters how often you take part in these events,' he says. 'You still feel the intensity. A manager feels bad about losing any match. But nothing compares with how badly you feel at losing an Old Firm game. Experience can help you handle a lot of things, but not losing a match against Celtic. It is not a pleasant feeling. ' </p> <p>If Smith's main selection problem is in attack - several options, but no settle partnership - Strachan's is one of availability in the same department. Scott McDonald and Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink, who combined for 51 goals last season, are unlikely to have recovered from injury, while Shaun Maloney, who returned from Aston Villa last week, is struggling to overcome a groin strain. </p> <p>'None of them trained today,' said Strachan on Friday, 'but we'll give them every chance. These are big games, but, contrary to what some people think, you don't win or lose the league in the first Old Firm match of the season.' </p> <p>Strachan was subjected to some hostility from Celtic fans after the 3-0 defeat at Ibrox in the corresponding fixture last year. By the last day, with a third successive title claimed, the clamour for his removal had evaporated. </p> <p>In the Old Firm religion, however, absolution tends to be short-lived.</p>",
  "<p>Any overhaul of your personal finances, whether to rein in runaway spending, slough off a lifetime of debt or to prepare for a new baby in the family, is an onerous task.</p> <p>It's not just the changes to budgets with less money that hit home, it's the enforced switch to a new, often unnatural, behaviour that can be hardest.</p> <p>For many women, giving up work to have a baby can be a difficult transition into a world of financial dependency, but when coupled with a daunting move to one of the world's poorest and most challenging countries, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), sorting out our finances became a life challenge.</p> <p>My husband, Si\u00f4n, works for the Department for International Development (DFID) and last year we were posted to the capital, Kinshasa, shortly after we had our baby, Niamh. So began a rapid unpicking of our lives as a double-income couple in London to become a single-earning family unit in the Congo.</p> <p>We went from separate bank accounts and savings to joint accounts, with a new understanding that henceforth this was a joint venture. We were also concerned to have one foot on the UK property ladder if we were going to be living abroad for some years; Si\u00f4n's package with DFID included accommodation, so we felt able to take on a mortgage and look for a property to buy. </p> <p>We thought a converted chapel in north Wales would prove a good business as a holiday let, as well as giving us a place of our own for trips home to see friends and family; the idea was that it would eventually pay for itself. Then came the downturn of the UK housing market and we suffered a significant business loss over the first year. But we knew it might take a few years to see a reasonable turnover and have also been able to write off some of the loss against tax. But until the housing market picks up and we can sell - or can make the chapel pay for itself - we're financially trapped in the developing world.</p> <p>The move to Kinshasa brought new personal finance struggles. The poverty eats away at you from the moment you arrive at the chaotic, rundown airport, where kids prey on the consciences and pockets of those who have just enjoyed the opulence of Brussels or Paris.</p> <p>The DRC is a 'hardship' posting and Si\u00f4n's salary includes allowances to compensate for the difficulties and expense of living where standard items cost more than in the UK. We could not be secure, healthy and survive on his UK salary alone, and have also taken out a DFID loan to buy a car, without which my daughter and I would be stranded. We have a comfortable house with a garden, and when the electricity cuts out a generator grinds into action and supplies enough current for the basics. </p> <p>The DRC is recognised as one of the hardest places in the world to do business due to poor governance, lack of infrastructure and high levels of corruption. As a result, there is no real insurance industry and offshore insurers are wary of the risky environment. A major worry is that we've been unable to get life insurance to cover the cost of our mortgage and have also been unable to fully insure our belongings. But we were able to get comprehensive car insurance through an offshore company, underwritten by Lloyds. You can get car insurance through the DRC government-owned insurance company, but the advice we've been given is that they rarely actually pay out.</p> <p>Kinshasa has two currencies - Congolese francs and US dollars - but while the dollar bills have to be flawless and are closely inspected at every transaction, a Congolese note can be black with dirt and practically in shreds.</p> <p>An average monthly food shop at one of the city's Lebanese or Indian-run supermarkets can cost around $300-$400 (\u00a3150- \u00a3200). Prices are prohibitive; a box of cereal costs \u00a34-\u00a39, a can of tuna more than \u00a32 and it's over \u00a325 for four litres of clothes washing liquid. Mostly you pay in cash, though some places accept Maestro or Mastercard - if their machine works.</p> <p>Having to give up my job, I was worried about my future financial security as I had only two very small pension pots. But the DFID offers a compensation allowance for spouses to help those actively looking for work abroad to keep up their pension payments. It does not apply if you choose not to work. </p> <p>We've had to work as a family unit rather than as individuals and learnt the value of the services and protections that cushion us in the UK. It is humbling to see how people struggle to get by with nothing but their wits, family and friends and (hopefully) a little luck.</p>",
  "<p>Just occasionally, a sporting contest really does make history or, rather, we make history of it. Jackie Robinson broke the colour bar in American Major League Baseball in 1947 and helped unleash energies that eventually culminated in the civil rights movements of the Sixties. When West Germany, on the eve of acquiring its sovereignty, won the 1954 World Cup final, it was seen as evidence that Germany had rejoined the international community and could turn the martial values of solidarity and collectivism to peaceful, even joyful, uses.</p> <p>In Playing the Enemy, John Carlin tells the story of the final of the 1995 Rugby World Cup and the decisive role it played in creating a real post-apartheid South African nationalism. Carlin has spread his net widely, interviewing much of the squad and its management, Nelson Mandela's bodyguards, ANC insiders and the head of the apartheid South African intelligence service. He has woven their lives and reactions to the game into a broader, and highly readable, history of South Africa's transition to democracy. </p> <p>But the core of the narrative concerns Mandela and his role in making history out of a game. In the early Nineties, rugby did not appear to be the stuff from which a non-racial democratic South Africa would define itself. For almost a century, it had been the game of Afrikaners, its raw violence seemingly well suited to this soldier-farmer nation. The rise of the Springboks to international predominance had coincided with the electoral victory of the National party in the Forties and the imposition of apartheid. The game, it seemed, was irredeemably bound to a partial and exclusionary nationalism. It was no wonder then that the ANC and its allies saw international rugby as a key arena of struggle.</p> <p>Opponents of the regime were vociferous in their support for anyone who might beat the Boks. The conflict culminated in the violence of the Springboks' 1981 tour to New Zealand, when every game was met by protests. The team's effective ban from international rugby after this helped prove to white South Africa that its regime was beyond the pale.</p> <p>It did not even occur to most of the ANC that this poisonous sporting legacy could become the material for forging a new South Africa. Mandela saw an opportunity and used it. In prison, he studied Afrikaner history and learnt Afrikaans, which he used to speak to his guards. Having discovered their almost sacred passion for rugby, he did his sporting homework too. He charmed not merely his warders but a steady stream of apartheid bureaucrats and politicians who came to his cell, once the liberation struggle had made the country ungovernable without him.</p> <p>Rugby thus became part of the intricate choreography of symbolic victories and concessions that made up the dance of South Africa's political transition. Against the backdrop of steady progress towards a one-person one-vote democratic state, the ANC offered white South Africa the resumption of international rugby in 1992. The first game of the new order, against New Zealand, turned into a cauldron of Afrikaner pride - the old South African flag was unfurled and 'Die Stem', the old anthem, was sung with gusto. However, rather than punish rugby and its social base, Mandela continued to court them. As Carlin argues, it was this mixture of astute politics and humane charm that carried the nation through its first successful democratic elections in 1994. </p> <p>But nation-building requires more than a constitution, more even than the new flag and the adoption of the liberation song 'Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika' alongside 'Die Stem' as a two-part national anthem. It requires moments of collective ecstasy, and that is what the final of 1995 Rugby World Cup offered. Mandela, against the grain of his own constituency, went out of his way to wear a Springboks cap, appeared at the final in the team shirt and at every stage argued that the Boks were now the whole nation's team. Carlin movingly describes how the Springboks came to learn and sing 'Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika' and how the crowd at the final, overwhelmingly Afrikaners, sang 'Nel-son, Nel-son'. South Africa won 15-12 in extra time, the nation celebrated and the rest, as they say, is history.</p> <p>In both sporting and political terms, that history has not always been an easy one. South Africa's victory at the 2007 Rugby World Cup, although universally celebrated, had none of the heady romance of 1995; the still overwhelmingly white composition of the team points to the enduring fault lines and inequalities of contemporary South Africa. </p> <p>A repeat of 1995 would require a triumph of similar magnitude for what remains the game of black South Africa: football. The 2010 World Cup offers just such a stage. However, it is not South Africa's footballers who will be on trial. Expectations of the squad are so low that if they make it past the group stages, there will be delirium. The country will be judged on its capacity to cope organisationally with the cavalcade that is the World Cup and to secure the safety of visitors to its notoriously violent public spaces. </p> <p>Perhaps the greatest lesson of 1995 is a mundane one about democratic politics: that economic modernisation and personal security, rather than reconciliation and reinvention, are the true benchmarks of national revival.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> David Goldblatt's most recent book is The Ball Is Round: A Global History of Football (Penguin)</p>",
  "<p>Homeowners who lose their jobs could receive more generous state aid to prevent a wave of repossessions. The proposals are a sign that ministers agree with Chancellor Alistair Darling that Britain should brace itself for the 'worst economic downturn in 60 years'.</p> <p>Downing Street and the Treasury are still locked in last-minute tussles over the details of a rescue plan for the housing market, but the Prime Minister is under pressure to include increased benefits that would cover mortgage payments for homeowners who lose their jobs .</p> <p>Talks are also continuing between Downing Street, the Treasury and housing ministers over whether to freeze stamp duty, with senior Number 10 aides arguing that such a move could tempt buyers back and help to shorten the duration of the house price crash. They also fear being outflanked by Tory promises to cut stamp duty. </p> <p>Homeowners can claim income support mortgage interest (ISMI), which pays the interest on their mortgages while they are on benefits, but only after being out of work for nine months - even though many risk having already lost their homes, with lenders going to court after just three months of missed payments. The benefit covers the first \u00a3100,000 of a mortgage. </p> <p>During the recession of the 1990s, the benefit was made available much earlier; Brown is under pressure to shorten the qualifying period and raise the amount covered. Downing Street sources confirmed that the issue was being seriously considered in a 'very wide-ranging package' of help. </p> <p>Another senior Whitehall source said yesterday there were still 'conflicting views' on stamp duty, adding: 'That is certainly not signed and sealed.' The Treasury has argued that the move would be expensive and would not help those who either cannot get a mortgage or are delaying buying because they think house prices will plummet. </p> <p>Adam Sampson, of the housing charity Shelter, said it would welcome improvements in ISMI, but that only a 'relatively small' number of cases would be covered: 'Most people in trouble with their mortgages are not in trouble because they took it out on the assumption of a single wage and that person is now unemployed. The majority of mortgages are based around two incomes and unless both suddenly become benefit-dependent it won't apply.'</p> <p>Tensions are running high over this week's two packages, tackling the housing market and fuel costs, because they are critical to Brown's hopes of rebuilding the government's popularity. </p> <p>Downing Street yesterday played down Darling's remarks, saying he was talking about the global economy, not just Britain, while Darling told Sky that the 'fundamentals' of the UK economy were still strong. However, he conceded that the UK was facing a 'profound economic downturn'.</p> <p>David Blunkett, the former cabinet minister, said the government must not make voters so depressed that they stopped spending. He thought that Darling was right to be honest, but added: 'There is a point at which that honesty turns into self-fulfilling prophecy. The lesson of 1968-69 and 1976-77 is that even when things started to improve, people had absorbed the message of difficulty and challenge to the point where they felt that there was no immediate hope of improvement and in such circumstances were inclined to blame the government.'</p> <p>Darling's gloomy verdict contradicts the official line from his deputy, Yvette Cooper, in campaign material published last week for activists, which advised them to argue that things were not as bad as under the Tories during the 1990s. </p> <p>Speculation of personal tensions between Brown and Darling were dismissed by friends of the Chancellor. But there have been policy differences over the contents of the housing and fuel packages and how to fund them. </p> <p>As The Observer revealed this summer, councils are also likely to be freed to buy the homes of people threatened with repossession and rent them back to their previous owners. This is expected to apply only to the poorest. </p> <p>While repossessions have so far hit mainly working people who borrowed too much, ministers now fear a surge of repossessions triggered by job losses, in which case ISMI could be critical.</p>",
  "<p>A friend of mine wasn't sure what she wanted to do after finishing her master's degree. Her thesis was on Old Norse sagas; academia didn't appeal to her. At Oxford, like a lot of Americans abroad, she took to one of the local sports. In her case, the modern pentathlon. The next thing I heard she was training somewhere in Texas to make the US Olympic team. It seemed to me a lonely way of spending your mid-twenties. I saw her again at our five-year college reunion. Most of my classmates hadn't changed much. Some had wives, husbands, kids, a lot of money. We all wanted to show off what we had made of ourselves, but other evidence was hard to come by. She brought along her silver medal.</p> <p>I thought of her as I drove up to Aarhus, on a cold, overcast Monday morning, to meet the British handball team. I had heard the Danish town is very pretty, with waterfronts and parks and outdoor cafes. What I saw, driving through, were tall square Soviet-style apartment blocks only a little relieved by the bike racks built into the pavements outside them. My liaison was a woman named Lynn, one of the veteran players, who had given me directions. I was surprised that she kept referring to their training camp as a 'school'. I found it at last, set back from the main road and hidden by municipal trees. The sort of place usually described as a 'complex': a car park, verges of grass, a vague assortment of low buildings.</p> <p>Lynn had not used the wrong word. It turned out to be a kind of finishing school for sporty Danes. They could study badminton, volleyball, handball etc in their gap years, before taking up university or working life. The British Olympic team had installed themselves there from August to May, among the rest of the students, to practise handball. There are only one or two regulation courts permanently marked for handball in the whole of Britain; the school alone has four. Students lived in pairs in narrow dorms, their beds stretched head-to-head against one of the walls. They ate in the canteen: five meals a day, including elevenses and an afternoon snack. These were hungry kids: the kitchen had been set up to cater for the stomach cycle of a working athlete. But that is only part of the reason the British team had come to the school. Most of them were only just learning the game.</p> <p>I found two of them finishing lunch and watching TV in the common room. There was something familiar about the scene. I had spent a year playing basketball for a second-division club in Germany. What I recognised, in the half-light, was not just the institutional carpets, plastic tables and windowless hallways, but something about the passage of time: the waiting around, between a meal and a run. I introduced myself. One of the pair turned out to be the Lynn I had spoken to on the phone, a short cheerful blonde Scot, who told me briefly about herself - she had only an hour or so to eat, between training sessions.</p> <p>At 29, she is the oldest player on the women's team; she has been out in Aarhus already for 18 months. Lynn belongs to the minority of British players who grew up with handball: a sport that, for whatever reason, has a small following in her hometown of Cumbernauld, near Glasgow. She is married with no kids. I asked her what she wanted to do when the Olympics were over. (The 2012 Olympics, I should say, to which Britain, as the host nation, have an automatic entry - which is why the British Olympic Association are putting so much effort into preparing a team. They didn't qualify for this summer's Games.) Go back to her old job, she said, as a sports therapist. But then she corrected herself. Start a family, probably. By that point she will be 33 years old.</p> <p>Her husband had, until recently, been living with her at the school. I wondered at this a little - it seemed a great commitment - until I learnt that he had been with the men's team. But he missed the last cut and was sent home. Every six months they go through reselection. You mean, I said, that you have no guarantee of making the team, even if you stick it out here for four years? No, she said. And from time to time the pressure of the school got to be too much. She had found a Danish family in Aarhus from whom she could rent a room. She was moving out next week. </p> <p>After she left, the other player introduced himself. Stuart had the sort of comfortable strong bulk that you get from working and eating, not from drinking creatine and lifting weights. I'm writing about the handball team, I said. I've been describing it as a cross between basketball and football. More like rugby, was his answer - which was also the sport he had come from. It's rougher than football, and you get the same kind of passing as rugby. I hesitated over the next question. Why did you stop playing rugby? But he didn't mind answering it. Injuries were part of the story, but he had got fed up with his club. When Talent ID said they were looking for anyone over 190cm tall, he thought he'd give it a go. And here he was.</p> <p>Talent ID is a UK Sport initiative started in 2007 to bulk out the Olympic squad for the 2012 Games. Its 'Sporting Giants' programme (for people aged 16 to 25 and over 190cm with athletic skills) concentrates on handball, rowing and volleyball. Stuart had been 24 when he signed up. It seemed a wonderful thing to me, to offer yourself up and ask to be judged, according to weight and height and other less easily measured physical gifts, and put to use. This is what you can do, somebody had said to him: handball. </p> <p>I asked how long he had been playing. Eight months, he said. And then, the inevitable question: how far can you go in the Olympics? His reply had a physical force behind it, the confidence of big shoulders. They had a great group of guys. The amount they had improved, in such a short time, was unbelievable, and there were still four years to go. With the people he saw around him, he fully expected a medal. It struck me then that this was the answer he had to give, to do what he was doing, to be there, in the middle of a cold Monday morning. I couldn't begin to judge him until I saw him play. I know from experience that all athletes are, to a certain extent, delusional; it's just that some of them also happen to be right.</p> <p>What did his rugby mates think about handball? I said, to fill the silence.</p> <p>He let the muscles of his cheeks do the smiling for him. They thought it was a bit gay.</p> <p>And what did he think about that?</p> <p>Two words: professional athlete. 'I'm getting paid to do this. How many people can say that?'</p> <p>There was a game that night for the men's team, I learnt after lunch, and it had slightly unsettled their routine. The guys were both nervous and expectant. Matches allowed them to measure their progress with a little objectivity, which is also why they feared them: anything seems possible in the hothouse comfort of the practice gym.</p> <p>I spent a few minutes after lunch watching the women's team warm up. We were in the bowels of the complex, a large windowless hall with stadium seating running up the sides. The girls got loose by playing football - they were mostly girls, Lynn was an exception. The rest were 17, 18, 19: they had interrupted nothing more serious than a gap year or a university degree. I got a sense, for the first time, of what a lark it must seem to them. The ball bounced high on the wooden floor of the gym; they chased it in restless clusters. Nobody scored, which became a part of the joke. There they were, wearing the little nylon jerseys of PE class, and knocking a ball about.</p> <p>The men were getting ready next door, someone in goal, the rest hurling shots at him. I picked up a handball for the first time. They are filthy things, about the size of a volleyball, but heavier, and covered in something grey and tacky like the mess left behind by a peeled sticker. Tacky, in fact, is what they call it. It helps the ball stick, and they smear their hands with the stuff, when they run dry, from a jar which I found at the side of the court. I dipped two fingers in. It looked and felt like molasses. (A week later my hand broke out in small blisters: this, apparently, is one of the side-effects of playing.) The first thing you notice is how easy tacky makes it to catch a handball: it more or less sticks to your palm. The next thing you notice is how hard it is to throw. </p> <p>I hoped to get in on the practice and had a word with one of the coaches, Axel Norgaard - he looked up at me in stolid amusement. 'Ja, ja, no problem,' he said. 'In time.' He had the patient air of a man conducting an experiment; at least, he was happy to include me in it. I asked what his ambition for the Olympics was. A medal? Eighth place, he said (out of 12). I had not expected so specific an answer. He explained: into the second round. He is a square, short man with the slack wrinkled cheeks of a trumpet player; he has blown a lot of whistles. It struck me how little he had invested in the team. If they lost every game, no one could blame him. </p> <p>Handball is a physical sport. You are allowed to do more or less anything you like, another coach (there were a great many) explained, so long as you pull your man towards you. Pushing is the foul. The most spectacular act of handball is the shot. Attackers are not permitted to step foot inside the penalty box, but they can jump as close as they like and are taught to delay as long as possible in mid-air, to stretch out horizontally, to land flat. Delay is everything: once the goalie has committed himself, it is easy to slip the ball into the exposed corner. There are seven corners to shoot at around the keeper: left bottom, left middle, etc. Received wisdom states that even the best goalie - swinging his arms and legs like a marionette - can cover only six of them. </p> <p>After five minutes warming up with the team, I took myself aside and watched from the sideline. Simple drills: running two steps, leaping, throwing in mid-air. (Not as easy as it looks, it turns out.) Catching the ball overhead, passing it back. Standing over a team-mate and lifting him two-handed off the ground. I was already breathing painfully; my legs felt like stretched elastic. It had been 10 years since I belonged to any kind of a team, and what I felt suddenly was - my age.</p> <p>When I was younger, in shape, I could have done those things without breaking sweat. What I have become better at in the meantime is hard to measure. In most of the measurable qualities I have declined. One reason, maybe, these guys were doing what they were doing. The alternatives would leave them stuck at a desk somewhere, in a library cubicle, in an office - beginning the slow physical death of working life.</p> <p>They started playing. For the first few minutes I looked on nervously: I could not imagine taking my place in that chaos of legs and arms. I had forgotten how to stand up, physically, to the challenge of other men; I had forgotten how to take pleasure from it. Then Axel sent me in. My job was clear enough: to run like hell every time a shot was fired. 'Have you got a passport?' a few of them joked, shouting, as I broke up a long pass. And for a minute, almost, I could take the question seriously. This is the kind of thing I might have tried, when I was younger; I might have become an Olympian, if only through the back door. Soon, though, my mouth began to taste of blood, and I felt a familiar headache brewing, an echo in my ears. On the next long pass, I stumbled, catching up, and ended up on my back. </p> <p>I thought: I would never give up four years of my life for this. Even when I had the chance, to make a living off basketball, I did not last a season. I asked a few of the British players what they wanted to do with themselves after the Olympics. Mostly, they had a sensible answer: finish their degrees, become physical therapists, etc. If you could make a living from this game, I said, in some first-division club, in some small Danish town, would you? They all said yes. I looked around me. It was three in the afternoon and we were in a windowless gym in an Aarhus suburb. This was the quiet, dislocated, prolongation of childhood I had fled from.</p> <p>At the end of practice, I saw someone shooting handballs against one of the basketball hoops bolted into the wall of the court. Nice follow-through, clean rotation. I had a few hours to kill before supper at the canteen and figured I could soothe my ego a little by taking him on at basketball. Mark, the shooter, called out to a friend of his, a tall muscular Scotsman (named Scott), and we played for an hour.</p> <p>Mark and Scott had been picked out by Talent ID. Mark had played basketball since he was a boy and started for his university at Aberystywth, whose team reached the semi-finals of the British championship during his final year. Most of the guys I talked to had a story to tell about why they didn't make it in their first sport. Injuries at the wrong time. Bad luck at a tryout; the politics of team sports. Mostly injuries. Mark admitted that he just wasn't good enough. He had a beautiful shooting motion, good balance and ball control, and a steady head - I could see that from playing against him. But he was half a foot too short for the kind of athlete he was: he needed to be taller or much, much quicker. And what he wanted to do with his life was play ball.</p> <p>Scott had a slightly different story. At my height, six-and-a-half feet tall, he was at least 50 pounds of muscle stronger. He moved to Texas for his final year in high school, to play basketball, and ended up in athletics, too: he won the state championship in the hurdles. There was no question of his athleticism. Even so, the standards demanded by American basketball have become almost ridiculously high. He was never going to be one of those guys who could pick a coin off the top of the backboard, he said. A few division-two universities showed an interest; instead, he signed with Texas Tech to run track. Then he broke his leg. Tech, as he explained it, offered to pay for the surgery or his tuition, but not both, and he decided to go home. When Talent ID came calling, he was playing basketball for the University of Strathclyde.</p> <p>I asked them again how far they could go in the Olympics. Their answers were hopeful and vague, and it struck me that I should admit what I already planned to write: that only the less experienced players expected medals. The coaches, the old hands, just hoped to make it out of the group stage. They nodded, unsurprised, and dropped for a minute their veil of optimism. I guess you have to believe that you can win, one of them said. Mostly they were just trying to make it through the next round of selections. Coaches expected them to keep a diary of their progress. Work on the left hand. Get stronger on defence.</p> <p>A recent article in the Times had argued that UK Sport were wasting their money on games such as handball. Britain would never develop a handball culture and the \u00a33m earmarked for it could be better spent elsewhere. They had no chance of a medal. When Australia put together a team for the Sydney Games, they finished 11th out of 12, and now the purpose-built courts were running to waste. I asked if they had read it. Yes - Scott had taped a copy to his wall, to motivate him. It seemed to make them feel the privilege of their position. They had been given a second chance at a sporting career and they were grateful.</p> <p>Even so, they pointed out a fact that the article failed to mention. South Korea had started from scratch in the years leading up to Seoul. The women had won gold in 1988; the men silver. South Korea had since become one of the handball superpowers, because they had invested in the sport itself. Mark and Scott both claimed that their commitment to the programme included the role they hoped to play after the Olympics, in 'growing' the sport at the grassroots. Australia lost their nerve and brought in, at the last minute, a number of dual nationals to fill out the squad. There was no guarantee that Britain wouldn't do the same, but they had been given assurances.</p> <p>You mean, I said, that you could stick it out here for another four years and still get dropped?</p> <p>Yes.</p> <p>And you wouldn't regret it, I mean, the time spent over here, doing this?</p> <p>I'm not sure I trusted their responses, but a little later I got the sense of what an honest answer might look like. While we were eating afternoon tea, Angie from the women's team came over. Scott had broken the 'friendship bracelet' Angie had given him, and he asked her to tie it back on. They spent an awkward minute or two fidgeting over his wrist together, before she gave up and promised him to make it bigger.</p> <p>I'm holding you to that, he said.</p> <p>I felt like I was intruding on a high-school romance. Angie, after all, had just finished her A-levels. But professional athletes often skip some of the steps on the way to adulthood. It struck me that what I had stumbled upon was a scene from a certain kind of office life.</p> <p>Late afternoon. The sense of earned idleness, as the pleasant muscular fatigue of the morning work-out sets in. Food on tap; no need to buy it, nothing to wash up. The institutional comfort of a mealtime. The casual intimacies of like-minded people. Their physical similarities. Health, long limbs, good looks. Even the 'sports' complex architecture, the distance from home, the road passing by the school car park, contributed to the feeling of exemption from ordinary life. Nothing was expected of them beyond a few simple, easily measured tasks. Work on the left hand, get stronger on defence. Eat. Rest. </p> <p>I showered before supper, standing on dirty tiles. As I was dressing, a few men in civvies filed in with bags on their shoulders; they began to get changed. Are you students here? I asked. No, one of them said. He introduced himself: Martin. Very fair and handsome, a round red Danish face. We're the handball team. The opponents.</p> <p>One of the wonders of sports, I think, is the way talent hides itself in the human body. A short fat man may have quick feet and hands, a sharp eye; he may have been born with advantages as tangible and undeserved as wealth or good looks. But you won't know it till you see him play. I tried to judge the threat this bunch posed. A rag-tag group, they looked like a student union. In fact, when I asked him who they played for, Martin named a local university: they were the B team. In the world of club handball, this put them somewhere in the fifth division. Even so, we are not very good, he added. Their record for the season was something like four wins and 14 losses.</p> <p>Do you know who you are playing tonight? I asked.</p> <p>Yes. The British Olympic team.</p> <p>Let me know what you think of them, I said.</p> <p>Scott and Mark were anxious. The last time they had played was six weeks ago, when they lost badly to a third-division club. It was only a friendly, but they were preparing for a tournament in October, with other second-tier national teams; and their funding was up for review after that. A great deal depended on the next few months - which was just about as long as Mark and Scott had been playing the sport. Neither knew if the coach would give him a start that night, a small but important token of his confidence. For the most part, they were playing in the dark: they did not know what management thought of them; they did not know how good they could be. I was glad to see Mark on court when the whistle blew.</p> <p>Handball, it turns out, is not bad to watch. To an unfamiliar eye, the scoring lacks variety, but there is plenty of it and many of the games stay close. Mark was stuck on the wing, where he had little to do; it seemed to me the great weakness of the sport is its failure to involve everybody at once. The front-court players carry most of the load, passing and shooting. Britain, at least, had a very good point man, a kid called Chris, who had grown up in Germany, a big steak-eating kind of a kid, with the baby-fat of muscular youth still on his cheeks. He powered his way through the defence and scored almost at will. The difference between him and the rest was obvious and made me realise the uphill battle faced by most. Chris had played all his life and it showed; I learnt later that he had made the B side of the German youth team. </p> <p>But the Danes kept pace. They had a squat, awkward inside man, who could turn on a sixpence and deliver the ball from almost any angle. The scores were level at half-time. After the break, the coach sent Stuart on, to contain the Danish threat. Stuart was the kind of athlete I hated to play against: a bully and a team man. He liked throwing his weight around. You got the sense that sport to him was a contest between the nobility of strength and the deceitfulness of skill. Well, the ref called a few fouls on him, then got tired of calling fouls and sent him off. Stuart could not believe it. He stood motionless with anger, just brushing off the few team-mates who tried to take him by the arm. And I remember thinking that the question I had asked at the beginning of this piece had had an answer: how much could I trust his self-confidence?</p> <p>The Danes pulled ahead and I was beginning to worry that the tide had turned when Mark caught a long ball on the break and flew in from the side to even the score. A minute later, he scored again. The niceness or fineness of technique that I had seen in his basketball stroke had found its expression here and I saw him afterwards, as he made his way back on defence, clench and unclench his fist: the gesture, familiar to me, of a kid quietly internalising a moment of success, counting his points. Yes, I can do it. Then the fitness of the British team began to tell and they held on, through the dying minutes, for a narrow win.</p> <p>I wondered how much of what they felt was relief, how much joy, but it seemed impossible to tell the difference. The women's team clustered around. A little bit better, Angie said to Scott, holding up two fingers in the air, a small way apart. You played a little bit better; and it was an ordinary Monday evening again, with time to kill before bed. Some of the veterans who had not played began to fool around in front of net, until the coach pushed a trolley of balls down the centre of the court and told them to clean up. </p> <p>I found Martin, even redder in the face than before, following his team out the door, and asked him what he thought.</p> <p>They have nothing to do with the Olympics, he said, more breathless than angry. </p> <p>I said, some of them have only been playing eight months. </p> <p>Well - but he had nothing to add.</p> <p>Axel was decently satisfied with the performance. I said, how can they hope to compete in the Olympics, when they can hardly beat a fifth-division Danish team? </p> <p>You must remember, of course, he said, their inexperience. It is remarkable, how far they have come. </p> <p>But you don't think they can win a medal?</p> <p>Of course (it was a part of his front, as a coach, a thick veneer of the obvious), they have a lot to learn from us still. But I think that the Danes also have something to learn from the British. When they set their minds to something, they do it.</p> <p>It was the note, I suppose, he wanted me to leave on. But what I thought about on the long drive home was something else. I remembered from my playing days the way each defeat positions you in the ranks of failure. It teaches you to recognise your level. But a win, no matter how narrow, leaves you a little room to hope. If I beat those guys, maybe I can beat the next lot, too, and if I beat them, who knows? Most of the players on the British team had already failed at something, at the games of their youth: they had reached those limits that sport makes painfully clear. This must be part of what draws them to Denmark and their strange life here. That they can ask themselves, as if for the first time, the childish question: I wonder how good I can be? </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Editor's note: Since this article was completed, Scott and Stuart are no longer part of the British handball team</p> <h2>Handball for beginners (including the GB squad) </h2> <p><strong>What are the rules?</strong></p> <p>Invented in Denmark in the late 19th century, handball is played with a team of six court players and a goalkeeper. Court players may run with the ball while bouncing it, but it must not touch their body below the knees; goalkeepers can stop shots with any part of their anatomy. To score, the player must throw the ball from outside the D-shaped goal area into the goal. Games last an hour and often feature 50 or 60 goals.</p> <p><strong>Why is it always on TV in Europe?</strong></p> <p>Handball has a huge following: the 2007 men's world championship final between Germany and Poland drew a global live audience of 23 million (more than the last day of the US Masters or the Wimbledon men's singles final). In Germany, attendances of more than 20,000 are common, while in Denmark the sport is arguably more popular than football, with one court for every 5,000 people. There's even a Handball Manager computer game.</p> <p><strong>Who are the sport's biggest stars?</strong></p> <p>Nikola Karabatic, a French international of Croatian extraction known as 'The Machine', has been dubbed 'the world's most complete player'. In the women's game, Grit Jurack of Germany has superb all-round skills. </p> <p><strong>How are Britain doing?</strong></p> <p>Until 2005, there was not even a GB team. In one early match, Britain lost by 30 goals to the Faroe Islands. Their progress will be shown when the women play in the Four Nations in Sheffield from 16-18 October; around the same time, the men travel to Oman. There are also now English leagues, with teams divided into North and South.</p> <p><strong>Could I make the team in 2012?</strong></p> <p>Height and athleticism are important. A certain amount of bravery is also useful, especially if you are playing in goal, where shots can travel towards you at more than 60 miles per hour. <br><strong>Charlie Douglas-Hughes</strong></p> <h2>London 2012: Another new ball game </h2> <p>Our handballers are not the only British team shooting for 2012 glory in a foreign country. Thanks to the new men's coach - Harry Brokking, who was previously in charge of Holland's national team - the British volleyball squad have been competing in the Dutch league. They took the place of Martinus, who, after struggling to find sponsorship for the 2007-08 season, agreed to let the British men play in their place. </p> <p>The exchange has not been an unqualified success. The decision was met with initial trepidation by Martinus's fans and when the season ended back in April the Brits had won just three games and suffered 25 defeats. Despite being backed by \u00a34m in funding, they finished last in the league.</p> <p>As with handball, the team is inexperienced and struggled against opponents desperate to 'put one over' the Brits. 'No one feels sorry for us, believe me - it's like a cup final every week,' says British captain Ben Pipes. Brokking is keen to take the positives from a character-building year. 'It's frustrating but to be expected, given the level at which they started,' he says. 'Inevitably, they are behind skills-wise, but this is a long-term project and they are making progress.' Indeed their progress is evident after the most recent international result - a 3-0 win over Egypt in Sheffield.<br><strong>CD-H </strong></p>",
  "<p>The battle is down to Oliver Wilson v Nick Dougherty for the 10th and final place among the automatic qualifiers for that Ryder Cup confrontation in Kentucky in three weeks' time. And for the first time since 1989, the event is likely to be without Colin Montgomerie, whose third-round 76 in the Johnnie Walker Championship ended what slim chance he might have had to pull off the essential win he needed to entice captain Nick Faldo into granting him a wild card. </p> <p>Not even a birdie at the last could get the eight-times Order of Merit winner to say anything more than: 'You've had quite enough from me this week, thank you very much.' </p> <p>Louisville, Kentucky, is better known as the scene of one of the world's great turf classics, the Kentucky Derby each year in May. But the Ryder Cup, on that paradisiacal layout called Valhalla on the outskirts of the city, will no doubt surpass it - certainly in global interest - when the European and American teams convene next month. </p> <p>Wilson and Dougherty are locked in conflict heading into the final day today of qualifying for places on the team, the two English would-be rookies vying for the 10th and final spot among automatic places for the European defenders of the trophy. Wilson is clinging to it after rescuing himself from the brink of a missed cut with a brave rally on Friday that produced two birdies and an eagle over the last 10 holes. That kept him in - just - and he built on that yesterday with a 68 that seemed to virtually lock up the last place in Nick Faldo's team. </p> <p>But Dougherty had not yet begun to fight. And when he did, the result was a 69 that took him to within two shots. He is on five under and sharing 16th place, with Wilson on three under and in 25th. Now Dougherty, currently 14th on the qualifying list, must win today to have a realistic chance. If he is second, Wilson will prevail by finishing at least 27th. </p> <p>Dougherty has struggled for form this summer since the death of his mother, but a tie for second at the Scandinavian Masters two weeks ago put him back in the hunt. 'I really do think I need to win. I have nothing to lose and it would be a wonderful way to make the side. I quite enjoy this challenge. I like it when the chips are down and the chips are against me,' he said. 'But it's fantastic what Olly has done. If I don't make the side, he would be a great person to have there.' </p> <p>Wilson was proud of his last 27 holes. 'I knew I could do it. I just had to get out of my own way. I seem to do better under that amount of pressure,' he said. </p> <p>All of which has almost consigned the other point of Ryder Cup interest of the week - who will gain the two wild-card selections from Faldo tonight. Not to mention the almost forgotten matter of the tournament itself, in which Gregory Havret of France, who birdied the last hole for a four-under 69 and a one-stroke lead over Anthony Wall, who shot 65. </p> <p>Montgomerie was one of those in contention for a wild-card pick, but after a miserable summer he knew he needed something very close to victory to make his case. Instead, after a day when there were numerous rounds in the mid-60s, he found himself down in a share of 54th place. Darren Clark is another candidate in the wild-card category and, after a 73, he will hope to have staked his claim by winning the Dutch Open last week. Two of the other contenders, Paul Casey and Ian Poulter, are underlining their credentials in the Deutsche Bank in Boston. </p> <p>Faldo's decision on his two picks will be announced tonight. The end of Montgomerie's affair with the Ryder Cup will mark a watershed for a man who never lost a singles match in eight appearances, and not even Faldo is likely to be moved by Open champion Padraig Harrington's plea that Monty should be kept in the team until he loses one. </p> <p>It also comes at the end of a bitter slanging match with another wild-card contender, Poulter, whom Monty suggested on Wednesday might have a hotline to Faldo regarding selection. Poulter reacted by hotly denying the suggestion and added that Montgomerie 'has enough work to do to try to make the team himself. He should just get his head down and try to play good golf.' </p> <p>Montgomerie's reaction to that was: 'It's nice to be told what to do by someone so young and so inexperienced.' </p> <p>'He did say he had spoken to Faldo. Has anyone else said that?' Monty added. It all adds up to a sad and sorry end to an illustrious Ryder Cup career.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on September 8 2008.

  "<p>As the dust settles on a glorious summer of golf, attention turns to the Valhalla club and the biennial battle between Europe and the United States for the Ryder Cup. The game's leading player may be stuck at home on crutches, but with so much at stake for both sides, even a Tiger-less tournament will no doubt be a gripping affair. Europe will arrive at the Jack Nicklaus-designed course in Louisville, Kentucky, as favourites, having won five of the past six, the past two by record margins. Paradoxically, though, without the imposing presence of Woods (his record is not great either), many observers expect a much tighter contest.</p> <p>With the Ryder Cup's record points scorer Nick Faldo at the helm and stalwarts such as Lee Westwood, Sergio Garc\u00eda and man-of-the-moment Padraig Harrington in the side, experience and confidence will certainly not be in short supply in the European camp. Not so on the American team; three rookies qualified automatically and even in-form local boy Kenny Perry has played only one Ryder Cup. With much resting on Phil Mickelson, Jim Furyk and Justin Leonard - none of whom is enjoying a vintage season - Paul Azinger's four captain's picks (announced on 2 September) will be crucial if the States are to avoid an unprecedented fourth straight defeat. The match starts on 19 September with two days of foursomes and fourballs, followed by the singles on Sunday; you can follow all the action on Sky Sports or Radio 5 Live. <br><strong>RG</strong></p> <h2>The key players </h2> <h2>Europe</h2> <p><strong>Sergio Garcia, Spain </strong></p> <p><strong>Age </strong>28</p> <p><strong> Ryder Cups </strong>4</p> <p><strong>Total Points </strong>15 (W14-L4-H2)</p> <p><strong> Win rate </strong>75%</p> <p><strong>Best format </strong>Foursomes (W8-L0-H0)</p> <p>He may not have his major yet, but Garc\u00eda's infectious optimism and inspired play have made him Europe's rock.

With two Tour wins already this year (the youngest player since Woods to achieve this feat), he's a star in the making.</p> <h2>The tactical battle</h2> <p>The relationship between Nick Faldo and Paul Azinger may be outwardly jovial, but their rivalry dates back more than 20 years, to the 1987 Open Championship at Muirfield. Having led all week, Azinger bogeyed the last two holes to lose by a stroke and gift Faldo the first of his six majors. Far from consoling the American, Faldo simply managed to say: 'Sorry about that, old boy.' A furious Azinger would never forget it, and after several previous encounters at the Ryder Cup - not to mention overcoming cancer in 1994 - he now has a chance to avenge that defeat...</p> <p><strong>Azinger</strong>, watching a video of their halved 1993 Ryder Cup singles match, at a PGA of America gala dinner in October 2007: 'Look at that: I had cancer and he still couldn't beat me.'</p> <p><strong>Azinger</strong>, talking to Ian Stafford of the Mail on Sunday in April 2008: 'If you're going to be a prick and everyone hates you, why do you think that just because you're trying to be cute and funny on air now, that the same people are all going to start to like you?'</p> <p><strong>Azinger,</strong> to the Associated Press as the story went global, talking about a message he left on Faldo's phone: 'This is Zinger. Well, it's already started. I don't know if you've seen it but one of those papers said I called you a prick and that everyone from your generation hates you. Even though you pretty much are and everyone pretty much does, I have more diplomacy than that.'</p> <p><strong>Faldo,</strong> to Golf Digest, responding to the Mail on Sunday quotes: 'Well, I know what Zing is like. He likes to joke and go to the edge. And the other thing is that he's used to talking to American journalists. He got a swift education in Fleet Street.' </p> <p><strong>Faldo,</strong> to the Times: 'Paul's telling everyone that he goes with the flow, and yet he's changed the points system, changed the number of picks, changed the foursomes to fourballs. He is monitoring everything.'</p> <h2>Head to Head</h2> <p><strong>Faldo / Azinger</strong></p> <p><strong>Ryder Cups</strong> 11 / 4</p> <p><strong>Matches</strong> 46 / 15</p> <p><strong>Matches won</strong> 23 / 5</p> <p><strong>Singles (w-l-h)</strong> 6-4-1 / 2-0-2</p> <p><strong>Foursome</strong> 10-6-2 / 2-2-0</p> <p><strong>Fourball</strong> 7-9-1 / 1-5-1</p> <p><strong>Overall</strong> 23-19-4 / 5-7-3</p> <p><strong>Points won</strong> 25 / 6.5</p> <p><strong>Majors</strong> 6 / 1</p> <h2> The crucial hole</h2> <p><strong>Valhalla Club, 7th hole, 'Player's Pick'</strong></p> <p><strong>601 yards</strong></p> <p><strong>Par: 5</strong></p> <p>At the Ryder Cup, the risk-and-reward holes are always the most exciting \u2013 think The Belfry's driveable 10th or the 16th at the K Club \u2013 and this year, on the course that Jack (Nicklaus) built, will be no different. The undoubted pick of the bunch is the par- five 7th, named Player's Pick. Measuring 601 yards and with a fairway split by a quarry, there are two distinct choices. The safe option favours the right fairway and enables the green to be attacked with a short-iron third shot. The gutsy play, though, is to go left. This route shortens the hole by 60 yards, bringing it well into reach in two for most players. The rewards are obviously there, but so are the risks\u2026 the ideal landing area on the fairway is only 24 yards wide while the approach, which can be anything up to 240 yards, is all over water. A classic Ryder Cup hole.</p> <h2>The wild cards</h2> <p>Since America started selecting wild cards in 1989, the captain's picks have had a huge say in the destination of the trophy. Who could forget Christy O'Connor's win over Fred Couples in 1989, Nick Faldo's last-gasp victory over Curtis Strange in 1995, or Monty's heroics in 2004? Both sides' wild cards have similar overall records, but while Europe's have performed strongly on the first two days, the US players come into their own in the singles.</p> <h2>Bad omens</h2> <p> <br>Since Europe replaced Britain and Ireland in 1979, no team has won four in a row. </p> <p>In both 2004 and 2006, Europe won 18\u00bd-9\u00bd. The last time Europe won by the same score twice in a row (14\u00bd-13\u00bd in 1995 and 1997), the Americans won by that same score the next time round. </p> <p>Over the past six Ryder Cups, on the five occasions that American golfers have won more majors than Europeans during that year, they have gone on to lose the Ryder Cup. On the one occasion that Europe won as many as the United States (1999), the US won the Ryder Cup. This year Europe has two majors, while the Americans playing at Valhalla have none. </p> <p>On a more positive note, Europe have scored 13 or more points in each of the past 12 Ryder Cups. They need only 14 to retain the trophy.</p>",
  "<p>When Nick Faldo retreated to his room at the Gleneagles Hotel last night to do some serious last-minute thinking, he was in the right place. This, after all, is the hotel where the G8 summit took place three years ago and, though there has been no need for heavy-handed security during this week's golf tournament, Faldo knows that, depending on the decisions he wakes up with this morning, some of the old knives from his friends in the media will be waiting for him.</p> <p>By far the most important thing a European Ryder Cup captain has to do is to make the right choices when it comes to his two selections to complete the 12-man side, in this case to travel to Kentucky in a fortnight. The rest, pairings apart, is largely ballyhoo and window dressing. If he gets it right then Faldo will have enhanced his reputation as the great strategist of his generation, but if he gets it wrong then a lifetime of achievement will be at least a bit diluted. Unfair, of course, but this is the way it is.</p> <p>In 1999, for example, Mark James, an apparently intelligent man, perversely ignored the claims of Bernhard Langer and instead chose Andrew Coltart, an amiable Scot who does a brilliant Sean Connery impression but whose pedigree was more Bean than Bond. Even more perversely, James then did not play his surprise choice until the singles, by which time a confused Coltart was struggling to offer a believable impression of a pro golfer. He duly lost 3&amp;2 to Tiger Woods and Europe conceded by a single point in Boston despite hammering the Americans to that stage. </p> <p>Of course, the wisdom of Faldo's decisions this evening will not be known fully until the result of the old clash itself is posted. Victory at the Valhalla Club may not entirely depend on who gets the nod today but the pre-match atmosphere and quite probably the perceived momentum of the European team does. To this point Faldo and Europe have the upper hand. The core strength of Europe's side as displayed by men such as Padraig Harrington, Lee Westwood, Sergio Garc\u00eda and Henrik Stenson contrasts reassuringly with a US team that, quite probably crucially, is minus post-op Woods. </p> <p>This has offered Paul Azinger the unique chance to declare his team underdogs. His all-too-obvious eagerness to set up camp on this low ground is understandable, for that Boston debacle marks the last time the Americans actually won a trophy they used to turn up for yawning before exiting victorious and still half asleep. Whatever else Azinger is good at, he is clearly good at making his excuses early. </p> <p>Faldo, meanwhile, has rightly been declaring himself mightily happy with his lot. Harrington's recent victory roll has offered a clarion call to excellence that has drawn the other European stalwarts towards the very centre of a very bright light. This, however, is all part of the phoney war, edgy men seeking an edge as they realise that the attention they have enjoyed while swanning around as captains over the past year is about to turn all serious.</p> <p>Not that Faldo will worry overmuch. He has always been happiest when challenged properly. So what will he do? Well, if he sticks to the plan he outlined to me over a breakfast coffee in Augusta five months ago then his deliberations last night will have been straightforward enough. 'I intend to pick the players in form and I plan to judge that form from our Open onwards. Rankings I don't care about,' he said. If he follows through on this there will be no place for Colin Montgomerie, no spot for Ian Poulter and no consolation for Justin Rose should the 2007 European No 1 slip out of his automatic place today.</p> <p>Monty is expecting little from Faldo. Early in his career he hung rather too keenly on the older man's every word but then the alpha-male stuff kicked in and they have been coldly distant for over a decade now. Anyway, he has been playing like a drain for too long to expect anything other than a bit of sympathy when someone points out that his absence for the first time since 1991 also means it is the first time since 1937 that no Scottish golfer has made the side.</p> <p>Poulter, too, has been floundering ever since he holed that putt on the last green at Birkdale, a putt he knew gave him a chance of victory in The Open. He should have made his place safe since then, but he has not. Despite the rumours of a 'done deal' after Poulter elected to earn money in the States rather than team points in Scotland, Faldo will have noted not just Poulter's absence but his recent drop in form. He still has a chance but much less of one following Darren Clarke's victory in Holland last week.</p> <p>The big Ulsterman was not in the frame until that win, but the confident way he held off Stenson's powerful surge over the final round will have impacted hugely with the captain. As will Paul Casey's recent run of results: seventh in The Open, eighth at Bridgestone, 15th in the USPGA, 26th at Wyndham and then seventh in last week's Fedex Cup play-off opener makes a compelling case for inclusion. If I were skipper then last night's deliberations would have taken place between turning out the bedside light and darkness finally closing in. </p> <p>Certainly, I suspect that Clarke and Casey are the names Azinger will not want to hear when he tunes into the telecast. Azinger is showing early signs of running scared right now, a jittery, brittle exterior offering evidence of what the inner man is feeling. His nerves will not be helped by the knowledge he has to announce his own selections in 48 hours' time. </p> <p>He made his acceptance of the USA captaincy dependent on the doubling of these picks from two to four. At the time a majority hailed his ballsy approach, but some of us have always felt that potentially he was merely, and unnecessarily, increasing the pressure on himself. This latter view holds real credibility now.</p> <p>A poll on the PGA of America website this week suggests that Joe Public over there believes he should pick Rocco Mediate, Steve Stricker, Zach Johnson and, wait for it, Woody Austin. This may well be the way to go for Azinger, but the other relevant thought for Europe this morning is 'Are we bothered?' Not, I suspect, a lot.</p>",
  "<p>Twenty years ago, as the Berlin Wall fell, people assumed the end of hostility between East and West, and a new world order founded on common values. As part of this, 10 Eastern European states joined Nato and intensified co-operation with Europe and more wanted to follow. But Russia's hostile action towards Georgia suggests that they are unreconciled to this new reality. Their aggression raises two urgent questions for us: how best to stabilise Georgia now, and how to make it clear to Russia that its unilateral approach is dangerous and unacceptable. War in Georgia also poses a serious longer term issue - how can we best create a rules-based international system that protects our collective security and safeguards our shared values?</p> <p>At tomorrow's European summit in Brussels we will first unite to alleviate the suffering of the 100,000 Georgian civilians left without homes. The UK has already pledged \u00a32m, and I will urge partners to meet not only Georgia's immediate needs but its long-term reconstruction and development needs. We will deploy peace monitors to better judge violations of the ceasefire, appoint a senior figure to drive the humanitarian and political effort, and support the Nato Georgia Commission, with a Nato team sent to Georgia.</p> <p>Georgia has felt the consequences of the conflict. It is important that the summit also demonstrates to Russia that its actions have real consequences.</p> <p>No one wants a new Cold War or the encirclement of Russia. But when I spoke to President Medvedev yesterday, I told him to expect a determined European response. As David Miliband has said, there can be no return to 'business as usual' unless and until Russia commits fully to Georgia's territorial integrity and withdraws to its previous positions.</p> <p>Russia has emerged as a significant economic power, with its trade increasing fourfold. It has done so by reaping the benefits of a stable global order based on agreements that make trade and investment both possible and profitable, bringing greater stability and certainty to international relations. Equally, when Russia fights secessionist movements in Chechnya or Dagestan, it expects others to respect its territorial integrity and not to recognise declarations of independence.</p> <p>So when Russia has a grievance over an issue such as South Ossetia, it should act multilaterally by consent rather than unilaterally by force. I believe Russia faces a choice about the nature of its responsibilities as a leading and respected member of the international community. My message to Russia is simple: if you want to be welcome at the top table of organisations such as the G8, OECD and WTO, you must accept that with rights come responsibilities. We want Russia to be a good partner in the G8 and other organisations, but it cannot pick and choose which rules to adhere to.</p> <p>That is why I will argue tomorrow that Russia should accept Georgia's territorial integrity and international mechanisms for addressing these conflicts, and withdraw troops to their previous positions. And, in the light of Russian actions, the EU should review - root and branch - our relationship with Russia. We should continue to strengthen the transatlantic relationship and may need to meet more regularly as the G7. We are also reflecting on the Nato response. We must re-evaluate the alliance's relationship with Russia, and intensify our support to Georgia and others who may face Russian aggression .</p> <p>No nation can be allowed to exert an energy stranglehold over Europe and the events of August have shown the critical importance of diversifying our energy supply. The tenfold increase in the world oil price in the past decade has demonstrated that diversification from oil is also an economic necessity. The UK will go from being 80 per cent self-sufficient now to having to import almost two-thirds of our gas and more than half of our oil by 2020 - precisely as markets become more volatile as more people chase fewer natural resources. And with states such as Russia increasingly using their energy resources as policy tools it is apparent that the security grounds for this shift are stronger as well.</p> <p>Without urgent action we risk sleepwalking into an energy dependence on less stable or reliable partners. That is why we in the UK are putting in law our commitment to cut CO2 emissions by 60 per cent by 2050, looking to replace our ageing nuclear power plants, to encourage greener fuels to power our homes and businesses and to transform the way we travel. Europe also needs to take action. Tomorrow's summit must add urgency to the work on Europe's energy agenda. We must more rapidly build relationships with other producers of oil and gas. Our response must include a redoubling of our efforts to complete a single market in gas and electricity, a collective defence to secure our energy supplies.</p> <p>I will also be pressing European leaders to increase funding for a project to allow us to source energy from the Caspian Sea, reducing our dependence on Russia. I will encourage European partners to use our collective bargaining power rather than seek separate energy deals with Russia. And because the environmental necessity is urgent, we must deliver an ambitious 2020 climate and energy package by the end of this year. </p> <p>More than 10 years ago Alexander Solzhenitsyn - who died just days before this latest chapter in the history of his country - wrote: 'We were recently entertained by a naive fable of the happy arrival of the end of history, of the overflowing triumph of an all-democratic bliss; the ultimate global arrangement had supposedly been attained. But we all see and sense that something very different is coming, something new, and perhaps quite stern. No, tranquillity does not promise to descend on our planet, and will not be granted us so easily.' The past few days have seen some of his predictions realised. </p> <p>This is why the changing global order cannot be governed by institutions designed in the middle of the last century. We now know how much more we have to do to create an effective system of international rules. We must strengthen the system of global governance to meet the challenges of our interdependent world. We must reshape our global architecture to meet the new challenges: climate change, energy security, poverty, migration. And in doing so we must stand up for both our vital interests and our essential values.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Sunday August 31 2008. </p>",
  "<p>For a few moments, the exuberant crowd at the Democratic convention this week fell silent. In sombre tones, Barack Obama's running mate, Joe Biden, described his regular evening commute by Amtrak train from Washington to his blue-collar home town of Wilmington, Delaware.</p> <p>'As I look out the window at the homes we pass, I can almost hear what they're talking about at the kitchen table after they put the kids to bed,' Biden told his audience in Denver. 'Questions they never thought they would have to ask.'</p> <p>He rattled off a list of America's economic woes: the soaring price of a tank of petrol, rocketing heating bills with winter around the corner, surging healthcare costs, job cuts and wage restraint. </p> <p>At the centre of it all, he said, kitchen-table worries revolved around the subprime mortgage crisis: 'Now we owe more on the house than it's worth. How are we going to send the kids to college?'</p> <p>With just over nine weeks until the presidential election, the crisis gripping America's economy has emerged as the most important issue on voters' minds. Some 61 per cent of the electorate cite economic concerns as the biggest problem facing the nation - almost double the 34 per cent recorded in January, according to the Pew Research Centre. Only 17 per cent cite Iraq as their greatest worry.</p> <p>For all the bluster about hope, renewal, wartime heroism and leadership, the policy battle is shaping up to be a classic confrontation of liberal versus conservative ideology. While Obama wants to tax the rich and channel aid to the poor, John McCain is explicitly pledging smaller government, balanced budgets and an extension of the Bush era of low taxation. It is a bottom-up philosophy against a trickle-down approach.</p> <p>'The economic news is going to be pretty much bad from here through till November,' says Dean Baker, co-director of the Centre for Economic and Policy Research in Washington. 'The economy is going to be front and centre.'</p> <p>While past presidential candidates have had the luxury of theorising over future policies, Obama and McCain face a crucial issue they can't duck: what to do about Bush's $2 trillion in temporary tax cuts, skewed towards the wealthy, which expire in 2010. While Obama would partially roll them back, McCain intends to make them permanent. 'The choice is stark and simple,' McCain told a recent town hall meeting in Colorado. 'Senator Obama will raise your taxes. I won't. I will cut them where I can.'</p> <p>Obama intends to increase rates for those with incomes over $250,000 - a mere 3 per cent of the population, his team says - to raise perhaps $700bn over a decade. McCain, meanwhile, presents himself as a paragon of fiscal virtue who will balance the budget by 2013.</p> <p>That's all very well. But experts point out that more immediate problems face the US as the credit crunch wreaks havoc with the financial system.</p> <p>'We're going to see more bank failures,' says Baker. 'They're going to have to decide whether to keep [lenders] Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as private companies. There's going to have to be more bank regulation. There are going to be a lot of big challenges to address.'</p> <p>The Bush administration has already tried throwing money at the economy to force it back on track through a $168bn stimulus package, which involved sending out tax rebate cheques of up to $600 per person. Obama wants to have another crack through a second injection of $50bn, combining a fresh round of rebates with a fund to prevent home foreclosures.</p> <p>'An extra $50bn in people's pockets would get us back to that sweet spot,' says Brad DeLong, an economics professor at Berkeley University in California who served in the Treasury during the Clinton years. 'It would keep employment sufficiently high but avoid an inflationary spiral.'</p> <p>DeLong, who is an Obama backer, says McCain takes the opposite view: 'He thinks not recognising the problem is the right thing to do. He's opposed to giveaways. He thinks these difficulties are down to feckless borrowers who took out huge loans and spent the money on holidays to Bali.'</p> <p>Both candidates have surrounded themselves with heavyweight economic brains, some of whom arrive with baggage. Obama rankled unions by recruiting a centrist, Jason Furman, as his economic policy director. Furman, who is close to the Clinton-era Treasury secretary Robert Rubin, is pro-trade, and annoyed left-wingers in 2005 by presenting a paper lauding Wal-Mart as 'a progressive success story'. </p> <p>Meanwhile, McCain has turned to Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office who has advised both Bush Presidents. Standing behind him are two Silicon Valley stars - the former Hewlett-Packard boss Carly Fiorina and retired eBay chief executive Meg Whitman.</p> <p>Some of the most bitter exchanges between the two camps have been about how to deal with rocketing fuel prices. To many non-partisan economists, this has exposed politicians at their worst. Obama backs a windfall tax on energy companies to fund 'emergency' refunds for low-income families; McCain has suggested a fuel tax holiday, suspending levies at the pump for up to three months.</p> <p>'Most economists would regard both proposals as not good ideas,' says Nigel Gault, chief US economist at Global Insight. He argues that a windfall tax is unpleasantly arbitrary, while a fuel tax holiday would lead only to higher consumption, boosting the profits of already well-fattened oil companies. </p> <p>'There's a problem with the US economy of too much spending, too much consumption,' says Gault. 'People need to save more. So it feels odd that you get out of a downturn by telling people: \"Here's some money, go spend more\".'</p> <p>With the countdown to polling day under way, a majority of voters appear to have grasped the basics of the two candidates' stances. In a Pew Research poll this week, 56 per cent said they knew 'a lot' or 'a fair amount' about Obama's economic plan and 54 per cent were familiar with McCain's proposals.</p> <p>Critics, however, question whether either candidate is being sufficiently frank. A neutral body, the Tax Policy Centre, has been trying to divine the cost of the promises made by each side. It reckons that Obama's tax-and-spend plans will add $3.5 trillion to national debt by 2018, while McCain's tax-cutting proposals amount to $5 trillion. </p> <p>In true populist tradition, both campaigns have been only too willing to promise extra spending. But neither side has outlined any cuts, with the exception of a pledge by McCain to stamp out pork barrel-style Congressional 'earmarks' for local projects - the most famous of which was $230m in 2004 to fund a so-called 'bridge to nowhere' between two islands in a remote part of Alaska. </p> <p>Roberton Williams, principal research associate at the Tax Policy Centre, says the difference is clear: 'McCain is saying, \"Let's cut taxes for everybody and help the economy grow,\" on the basis that a rising tide lifts all boats. Obama is arguing that the rich have got very rich and can afford to pay a little more because the people at the bottom are struggling.'</p> <p>But, he adds, radical-sounding messages from the candidates are often 'clarified' into blander proposals by backroom advisers: 'There's a real tension between the policy people and the political people. On the stump, they want to say things that are simple and that resonate.'</p> <p>Both campaigns are seeking endorsements from business leaders to add a dusting of gravitas to their economic expertise. McCain has secured public support from the veteran FedEx boss Fred Smith, from Merrill Lynch's John Thain and Sun Microsystems' Scott McNealy. </p> <p>The Obama side boasts fewer big business names, although it does have the vote of the world's richest man, Warren Buffett, a longstanding Democrat. Other Obama fans include former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker; and the campaign is assiduously courting Google's chief executive, Eric Schmidt.</p> <p>International trade remains an evergreen fissure running through US politics. While McCain has been firm in his defence of the free trade agreement, Nafta, the Democrats have promised, albeit without specifics, to renegotiate treaties to protect US workers.</p> <p>Luke Froeb, a free enterprise expert at Vanderbilt University's management school in Nashville, identifies this as a key ideological gap. He argues: 'Renegotiating Nafta would make our economy a lot less flexible. It would reduce income and make us all worse off.'</p> <p>An overt McCain supporter, Froeb views Obama as a classic interventionist who overestimates the government's power to control the economy. 'He's relatively young. He knows enough to be arrogant and not enough to be humble,' Froeb says. 'Whereas McCain knows enough to be humble. He sees a problem and he may understand that there isn't an immediate solution.'</p> <p>More radical aspirations lurk behind both programmes. McCain has talked of an overhaul of America's tax code to replace the present six income bands with just two. Obama has floated a crackdown on predatory behaviour by banks - including a 'risk rating' system advising consumers on which credit cards to take out.</p> <p>In contrast with Britain's increasingly narrow political battleground, where 'tax rise' remains a deadly phrase, the US election amounts to a true collision of economic philosophy. Yet for all the boldness of the proposals, executive authority is strictly limited - any plans will inevitably be altered in lengthy tugs-of-war through Congress.</p> <p>As the long, hard run-in to polling day begins, both sides are keen to distance themselves from President Bush's economic legacy. The Obama camp is hopeful that this year's downturn could create just enough disillusionment to push its man over the line.</p> <p>'We did not arrive at the doorstep of our current economic crisis by some accident of history,' Obama told a recent rally in North Carolina.

It determines the type of job you take, or, for those many millions not provided with health insurance at work, it forces you to take a second or third job just to pay the premiums.</p> <p>And even with insurance you may not be safe. The latest figures from the American Association of Retired Persons show that more than 1.85 million Americans - many of whom have what they think is very good health insurance - are every year forced into bankruptcy because of a medical emergency. </p> <p>More than 45 million Americans don't have any health insurance to speak of, nor do they qualify for the paltry amount of free healthcare made available to the very poorly off.</p> <p>I learnt last week how broken, stressful and altogether backwards the American system of paying for healthcare can be when I was unexpectedly admitted to my local hospital for an MRI scan.</p> <p>I am lucky enough to have a wife who works at a big US company that provides us with much better health insurance than we could ever afford to buy. This, coupled with the fact that I was weaned on the good old NHS, meant I was not remotely concerned about the cost of my visit to the hospital. Until I got there.</p> <p>The first thing I had to do at the reception of New York Methodist Hospital in Park Slope, Brooklyn, was phone my insurance company - even though I was being admitted as an emergency. I sat on the phone for 45 minutes responding to various recorded messages, punching one for yes and two for no as if I was paying my cable bill. At the end of this process, I was told that my insurance did not cover the first $721 of the MRI scan and only 80 per cent of the emergency treatment and any other subsequent hospital stay, drugs etc.</p> <p>A spell in hospital costs hundreds if not thousands of dollars a day and I was to be admitted for a minimum of five days. I was also slated for at least three MRIs, a lumbar puncture and lots of medication.</p> <p>And that is when the reality of living with the American healthcare system really sank in. I was no longer thinking about my potentially serious spinal cord injury. I was thinking about medical bills.</p> <p>McCain does not seek to alter the status quo sufficiently to give Americans respite from the current potentially crippling system. Sadly, Obama's proposals to fix it do not go far enough either.</p> <p>But both of them must know that until Americans can live secure in the knowledge that a single trip to the ER will not wipe out their finances for good, the 'dream' they speak of living will remain a financial nightmare for all but the very wealthiest.<br><strong>James Doran</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on September 8 2008.

  "<p>Inside a tucked-away room in a rarefied part of central London, there is a murmur of civilised chatter and the click-clack of designer shoes on parquet floor. In the corner, two well-dressed women are exchanging feverish whispers. 'I want it,' says one. 'Well I saw it first!' the other hisses.</p> <p>It is the sort of scene one might expect at a high-end fashion boutique where the trade is in cut-price designer clothes or must-have handbags. But this is a private view of an unknown artist's work, a recent graduate from art college who specialises in intricately crafted oil paintings. The two women are not desperate fashionistas, but rival art collectors, and their latest killer accessory is a piece of art from the Next Big Thing.</p> <p>'It was extraordinary,' says a bystander. 'They were literally fighting over the piece. It got to the stage where they were bidding against each other in the middle of the room. And this wasn't even for a well-known artist - that's a mark of just how competitive the art market has become.'</p> <p>There used to be an accepted wisdom that you couldn't put a price on great art. But that was before creativity became a commodity; before it became an asset so bankable that investors could be virtually guaranteed a three-fold return in the space of a year. Now, with a new generation of self-made collectors with an eye for talent and money to burn, art is big business and everything has a price tag.</p> <p>Last week, the Duke of Sutherland's decision to sell a pair of Titian paintings for \u00a350m each acted as a forceful reminder of art's rampant commercialisation. The two works - Diana and Actaeon and Diana and Callisto - have been on loan to the National Gallery of Scotland in Edinburgh for more than 60 years as part of the Bridgewater Collection, one of the most important private art collections in the world.</p> <p>It says something about art's upwardly spiralling value over the last decade that the sum of \u00a3100m for two Titians is now viewed as a bit of a bargain. The Duke of Sutherland, advised by his accountants to diversify his portfolio in a time of economic uncertainty, is said to take his public responsibilities very seriously; although it will be a formidable challenge for the money to be raised by the end of the year, it is generally acknowledged that the paintings would fetch three times as much on the open market.</p> <p>The potential loss of such a substantial chunk of the nation's cultural heritage prompted a public outcry. The artist Tracey Emin pointed out that the paintings could be saved if everyone in the UK contributed 'the price of a packet of biscuits'. Jeffrey Archer, the peer and novelist, waded into the fray with his opinion that \u00a3100m would be better spent on a children's hospital. Whatever the rights and wrongs of spending public money on works of art, one thing remains certain: if the public purse does not buy the Titians, someone else's will. </p> <p>Over the last five years, a new kind of private buyer has emerged in the art world and transformed the cultural landscape. Competition for works is cut-throat, with buyers emerging from Russia, Asia and the Middle East. </p> <p>Often, these new collectors are self-made millionaires with a background in private finance, such as David Roberts, a property developer whose collection of 2,000 works has made him one of the UK's most sought-after buyers. Increasingly, they are women with a flair for spotting new talent and a bottomless capacity for networking - women such as Daria Zhukova, the girlfriend of Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich, who has just opened a Moscow gallery that is tipped to become Russia's answer to Tate Modern. Sometimes they are Middle Eastern oil magnates seeking a new outlet for their investment, such as Sheikh Saud al-Thani, the first cousin of the emir of Qatar whose outlay dwarfs that of other auction-room habitu\u00e9s such as Elton John, Bill Gates or the Sultan of Brunei.</p> <p>There is, for all of the new vanguard, a certain aspirational cachet to owning important works of art. Even more importantly, there is also a surefire economic return. At London's annual Frieze contemporary art fair, demand has become so intense that serious buyers need to get their name on a reserve list before the most desirable works go on sale. 'Unless you're on the list, there's no chance' says Isabella Macpherson, the co-founder of the art agency Arts Co. 'Hence the \"new collectors\" are doing their due diligence, building relationships with gallerists and dealers, going to the international art fairs and all this becomes a bit addictive because it's glamorous - a closed circle of fabulous events and supposed creativity - and that's a giddy ride for them.'</p> <p>The London art market has enjoyed a resurgence in recent years with wealthy natives, and the influx of cash-rich 'non-domiciles', turning increasingly to art as both passion and investment. Prominent among these is Newcastle-born Anita Zabludowicz. She collects art with her billionaire Finnish husband Poju who runs the private investment group Tamares. So extensive and prestigous is their collection that late last year Zabludowicz opened the 176 institution in Camden, north London, a venue to show works from the collection. London-based Persian collector Fatima Maleki first acquired old masters before developing her interest in contemporary art. She stresses the global nature of the collecting mania at this very high level: 'Art is taking people across the world' and notes how insiders are beginning to look more towards the Middle East. </p> <p>New collectors such as these contrast strongly with the old establishment figures such as the reclusive John Paul Getty or the immaculately educated Denis Mahon, who both belong to a different era of eccentric personal tastes and inherited family wealth.</p> <p>'Historically, collectors were quiet connoisseurs who took their time, studied their purchases and were under no pressure to buy because there were so few of them,' says Sarah Thornton, the author of Seven Days in the Art World. 'In the past five years, there has been a relentless boom. Now you go to an art fair and all the work on a stand will have sold out within two hours.'</p> <p>The febrile atmosphere has largely been driven by art markets opening up in unexpected places - in Qatar, an oil state looking for new sources of revenue, five international art museums are currently in the pipeline. </p> <p>'In Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, there are plans to open up a Louvre franchise - a nametag that cost them \u00a3260m. Investors from the Middle East remain the most likely buyers for the Bridgewater Titians, although they might be put off by the paintings' partial nudity.</p> <p>David Roberts, one of the UK's foremost art collectors whose collection includes works by Damien Hirst and Marc Quinn, says: 'The deep-pocketed overseas buyers have meant that prices have gone completely crazy and yes, that does make it more difficult to buy pieces.'</p> <p>Roberts, who is launching a foundation to benefit young curators and artists, is an increasingly rare breed - a collector who buys purely for the love of it and who simultaneously acknowledges a responsibility to make his works available for public view. 'I've never sold anything and I've no idea of my collection's value. I do think it is a great shame in general when something that's quite important in the art world disappears into private hands never to be seen again.</p> <p>'There is a national pride attached to the Titians. I think it is important to have good, great quality work in the UK. It is important to have it on your doorstep, for it to be accessible to people.'</p> <p>But with art becoming such a global enterprise, does it really matter whether the Duke of Sutherland's Titians remain in British possession? Presumably, the paintings would have just as much impact if they were on view in other countries and, with the advent of the travelling 'blockbuster' show, there is an increased chance that works sold abroad will come back on tour in the future?</p> <p>'I really believe in culture as an ambassador of ideas,' says Thornton. 'I think it can make great contributions to fledgling democracies and a Titian could have even more of an impact being seen in Doha [capital city of Qatar] than in London because it challenges a whole raft of psychological assumptions. </p> <p>'We are spoiled in the UK because we have so many masterpieces. It would be quite exciting for the paintings to be available somewhere that had never been exposed to this kind of art before.'</p> <p>Wherever the Titians end up, their sale will inevitably stoke the fires of the international art market. Art has become the new social status symbol. Now everyone wants a bit of it, at whatever price the seller puts on creativity. As the legendary New York gallery owner Mary Boone once said: 'I had reservations about making art a business. But I got over it.'</p> <h2>Saved for the nation</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>In 2003, the Getty Museum offered the Duke of Northumberland \u00a335 million for Raphael's <strong>Madonna of the Pinks</strong> believed to be one of the finest old master paintings in private hands. The National Gallery declared the sale would be a 'serious loss' for the nation. After donations, including \u00a311.5 million from the Heritage Lottery Fund, the Duke agreed to sell the masterpiece to the National Gallery for \u00a322 million.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Sir Joshua Reynolds' <strong>Portrait of Omai</strong> is now in the Tate Gallery thanks to an anonymous \u00a312.5 million donation received after the government placed a temporary bar on the work, sold in 2002 for \u00a310.7 million. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Turner's <strong>The Blue Rigi</strong>, one of the best watercolors produced by the artist, sold for a record \u00a35.8 million in 2006, and is exhibited at the Tate. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Botticelli's <strong>Virgin Adoring the Sleeping Christ Child</strong>, previously in the collection of the Earl of Wemyss had an asking price of \u00a315 million. Though offers were made from abroad, the National Galleries of Scotland, bought the picture after numerous donations for \u00a310.25 million.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Canova's <strong>The Three Graces </strong>cost \u00a37.6 million when it was acquired jointly for the V&amp;A and National Galleries of Scotland. The Getty Museum had offered it to a private seller but its export was stopped. </p> <p><strong>Caroline Davies</strong></p>",
  "<p>Dick Fuld, the embattled chief executive of Lehman Brothers, has done well to keep his job for this long. Merrill Lynch and Citigroup ditched their bosses at the start of the global credit crunch while Bear Stearns boss Jimmy Cayne was forced out in January, shortly before his bank was bailed out by the Federal Reserve and JP Morgan. </p> <p>Since that rescue, the smart money has been betting that Lehman and Fuld will be the next victims of the financial crisis but, six months on, both the bank and its boss are still standing, although they seem more rickety by the day.</p> <p>Their foundations will get another knock next month, when the bank is expected to unveil further massive write-downs along with third-quarter figures - forecasts range from $3bn to $4bn (\u00a31.5bn-\u00a32bn) - which will push its losses for the six months to the end of September close to $5bn, or more than the $4.2bn net income it earned in 2007. Lehman's shareholders will be hoping he can accompany that with some good news to help shore up the bank's plunging share price - they have lost more than three-quarters of their value over the last year.</p> <p>The question is what good news? While there have been rumours that it is keen to sell its fund management business, Neuberger Berman, in order to shore up its balance sheet, analysts are not convinced this is a serious option. For a start, its predictable earnings - one of the attractions for Fuld when Lehman bought the business for $2.6bn five years ago - are even more welcome when mortgage trading and other investment banking markets are crumbling: in the first six months of the year, Neuberger accounted for almost 40 per cent of its net revenues. </p> <p>Fuld is believed to be trying to sell just a part of the business, or to take warrants allowing him to buy it back should the business climate, and Lehman's balance sheet, improve. But with write-offs and trading losses eating into the bank's already thin capital, its scope to negotiate that kind of deal is limited.</p> <p>So, too, is the potential for selling a stake to the Korean Development Bank, another hot rumour of the last month. Even before the Korean authorities started pouring cold water on the likelihood of such a high-risk venture, Fuld's price expectations were already rather ambitious: one analyst says he was holding out for a price of between 20 and 50 per cent above the bank's book value of around $40 a share, or as much as four times its current share price. </p> <p>Such optimism is understandable: Fuld was instrumental in creating the investment bank in its current form.With Cayne's departure, holds the record as the longest-serving chief executive in the business, having taken on that role in 1993, though some say his days at the top are numbered. Much of his wealth is tied up in the business - his 11 million shares represent 2.4 per cent of the business and he was paid $35m last year. This will make him uncomfortably aware of the losses suffered by the many employees who also hold shares through bonus and incentive plans as the share price has collapsed. It has also slashed the value of his own pay-off arrangements: at the end of 2007, he would have collected $241m, based on a share price of around $63; at $15, that has sunk to $57m.</p> <p>But Dick Bove, respected banking analyst with Ladenburg Thalmann, thinks a takeover of Lehman is inevitable, regardless of Fuld's reluctance to sell on the cheap. He points out that Lehman's value is only around $8bn, little more than private-equity firms have injected into much smaller banks like Washington Mutual. 'There is an opportunity to take the company and break it up and make much, much more by selling off the parts.'</p> <p>And he does not rule out trade buyers: while he thinks a bid from an investment banking rival such as Goldman Sachs or JP Morgan, busy dealing with their own problems from the global financial crisis, is unlikely, Japanese or Canadian banks could well be interested. Britain's HSBC could also be keen, as could a break-up specialist such as Lazard or Greenhill, which could orchestrate a consortium bid.</p> <p>There is unlikely to be such an easy exit for two of the other biggest casualties of the housing slump and credit crunch: Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the giants that back around half of all American mortgages. While they cannot survive in their current form, deciding what to do about them is one of the biggest headaches facing US Treasury secretary Hank Paulson.</p> <p>Bove points out that their combined debts, including off-balance sheet borrowings and conduits, are around $9 trillion - almost twice the $5.5 trillion of US public debt. It is, he says, an 'outrage' that they were allowed to get this big. He thinks their accounting failures - Freddie Mac admits that its accounts for the past two years cannot be relied on - make it as big a scandal as Enron. Ken Murray, chief executive of fund manager Blue Planet, a specialist in financial services funds, thinks that Fannie Mae may be able to trade its way out of the crisis provided signs of a bottoming in the housing market prove sustainable. Freddie Mac's survival is 'more tenuous as it has less capital'. </p> <p>Citigroup analyst Bradley Ball is even more optimistic: 'Our analysis ... shows that both [Fannie] and [Freddie] should have sufficient capital through [at least] year-end 2008... under a variety of negative credit scenarios ... all parties could wait it out until market conditions calm.'</p> <p>That may also be Paulson's hope - and there was encouraging news last week when Freddie Mac managed to raise new finance through a bond issue, albeit that it had to pay a punitive interest rate to do so. Their size means that unravelling them will not be easy: the market has been waiting for Paulson's decision for weeks. </p> <p>Until then, says Andrew Milligan, head of global strategy at Standard Life, it is hard to know how it will affect the market. 'Many questions can be asked about the implications of a Fannie and Freddie bailout for equity markets in general, and financial stocks in particular, or how it would affect US growth, inflation, the budget deficit, bond yields and currency.' Among the options are an effective nationalisation, refinancing the debt or encouraging the companies to work through their problems. </p> <p>But, he adds: 'Under few of [the possible] scenarios, though, do Fannie and Freddie return to their former clout within the marketplace.'</p> <p>Blue Planet's Murray thinks we are entering the third stage of the credit crunch - that of write-downs of the ongoing loan book - having got through the first two phases of liquidity crisis and suffering losses on the financial instruments that exacerbated the downward spiral. The problems of </p> <p>Lehman, Freddie and Fannie suggest that this phase will be at least as traumatic as the first two.</p>",
  "<p>Marius Kloppers, chief executive of mining giant BHP Billiton, could be the patron saint of late starters. Some titans of industry start mapping out their destiny almost from birth, but not Kloppers, who in his twenties played the role of perennial student.</p> <p>This is a comforting thought for the parents of young slackers and drifters - but only up to a point. Kloppers didn't just loaf around on the sofa in a hungover haze. He completed a first degree in chemical engineering in his native South Africa, a doctorate in materials science from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, then an MBA at the elite Insead business school in France. </p> <p>'I did a whole slew of degrees because I couldn't figure out what I wanted to do,' he says. The experience has come in useful: his wife, Carin, runs a hostel for university students where he occasionally offers counsel to directionless youth. 'There was a young man there of 30 who hasn't quite found what he wants. I told him that's fine, I really didn't discover what I wanted to do until I was well into my thirties. On the continent it is absolutely acceptable to join the workforce at 28 or 29, but in the UK there is an obsession to get a job at 21. I didn't even get a driver's licence until I was 27. When I did start, my career just evolved, there was no strong degree of planning.' </p> <p>It has been some evolution. He began work at management consultancy McKinsey, then moved into the mining industry in South Africa, where he was flummoxed by the Geordie accent of one of his superiors. 'I was a little Afrikaaner boy, recently graduated, very dapper, and I'm the bag carrier for a Geordie guy and a Scottish guy. I can understand the Scotsman, but not a word of what the Geordie is saying,' he laughs, remembering his discomfort.</p> <p>Lack of fluency in the Geordie dialect didn't hold him back. Kloppers' turbo-charged ascent took him to the chief executive's office at Anglo-Australian BHP last year at the tender age of 44. He had hardly tucked his feet under the desk before he and his doughty Australian chairman, Don Argus, launched an audacious $127bn takeover assault on rival Rio Tinto - quite something, even in the testosterone-sodden, expansionist world of mining. The bid is making waves well beyond the usual confines of the City; it is being closely watched by political leaders in Europe, the US, Australia and, most important, China.</p> <p>If Kloppers succeeds, the combined company will control 40 per cent of China's iron ore imports and have huge positions in aluminium, copper, uranium and coal. The appetite for raw materials from emerging nations is virtually insatiable. And it is no exaggeration to say that the deal would make the boyish, crop-haired executive one of the most powerful men on the planet.</p> <p>Kloppers, who spent two years in the South African army, is a tough cookie, but he is facing formidable opposition. He and Argus are up against Rio's 50-year-old American chief executive, Tom Albanese, and Paul Skinner, the company's seasoned chairman, who are not about to roll over. They make a strong case that Rio will create more value on its own than as part of the BHP behemoth, and have rejected as too low a proposal of 3.4 shares in its rival for every one Rio share held. </p> <p>The two sides have engaged in a war or words - or rather of numbers - over which company is performing the best; an objective observer is hard put to choose between their competing claims. Both, however, turned in record results this month, with BHP's full-year profits up 22 per cent and Rio's half-yearly figures also rising steeply. </p> <p>The two main hurdles for Kloppers are price and regulation. Albanese and Skinner will not even think of capitulating unless they are sure they have extracted the best possible price, so won't Kloppers have to raise his offer to win? </p> <p>'Ultimately, the shareholders will decide, not management. We feel very confident on a relative-value basis that the deal is correctly fixed, so our main focus is on clearing the regulatory hurdles,' he says, though he would hardly admit at this stage that he might be ready to increase the offer. He also expresses confidence about navigating the tortuous course through regulators in Brussels, the US and Australia, though some independent analysts are sceptical. That is on top of placating China, which, as the world's biggest steel producer, is understandably concerned. BHP has provisional permission from the American Department of Justice, but Australia's competition regulator has stopped the clock on its ruling and the European Commission is not expected to deliver a verdict before November: 'It is hard to predict, but we feel we are on solid ground with our case.' </p> <p>BHP has certainly gone to huge lengths to produce as watertight a bid as possible. It has hired a team from MIT to do all the econometric modelling. In essence, its argument boils down to the idea that BHP and Rio have a number of operations running alongside each other. BHP reckons that combining them would enable them to produce at a lower cost, giving the incentive to produce as much volume as possible, which in turn would reduce upward pressure on prices. </p> <p>As for Beijing, state-owned aluminium company Chinalco has already made a dramatic entry into the fray by buying a 12 per cent stake in Rio, which gives it a material influence over the outcome. What does Kloppers think is their game plan? 'I can only speculate. They saw a bid was coming - they must have thought they want to be part of this unfolding. If there is a log jam, you've got to have a log in it. It is an interesting position for Rio. I don't know what they think about that, but it is a big shareholding.'</p> <p>Kloppers has a reputation as a macho alpha male, but either he is on his best behaviour or is genuinely genial and personable. Home, insofar as someone who sleeps so often on aircraft has one, is in Melbourne, with Carin, his childhood sweetheart, and their three children. When he talks about his family, the warmth is obvious, but his softly spoken words can carry an undertone of menace when discussing the bid. </p> <p>'There is no such thing as an unfriendly deal at the end of the day,' he says, which is true, since the vanquished company is left with little choice. 'It would have been much easier if we could have been really friendly right from the start. The competition side would have been easier, and it would have been easier to think about social arrangements when we combine management teams and so on. Unfortunately, that is not where they are. We still hope that at the earliest possible moment they will start understanding.</p> <p>'But nobody has done anything here that is not by the rules of cricket. Nobody has destroyed the ability of these two companies to work together.' </p> <p>However, most mergers, as Kloppers well knows, don't increase value, they destroy it. Why should this deal be in the minority that work? 'These two companies have a basically Anglo-Saxon heritage, they operate the same sort of mines, they live by the same sort of values. We hire each others' people all the time - you are not combining radically different cultures.</p> <p>'Then there is a steely determination on our part always to simplify. We would want to make it the simplest possible business. Before merging with Billiton, BHP had 110,000 people. Now we have 40,000 because we have sold all of our downstream businesses and all our smaller operations and concentrated on the big ones. The organisational structure is simple, there are no fancy charts. In the end, we dig stuff out of the ground.' He adds that the two companies operate alongside each other in the iron-rich Pilbara region of Western Australia, they have diamond mines next to each other, and jointly run the Escondida copper mine in Chile: 'We overlap all over the place. We would just say one management team, one management team, one management team.'</p> <p>Given that energy and resources are increasingly being used as weapons in the new great geopolitical game, is there a sense in which the West needs its own champion? 'It is important for the West to look at who operates in the free market according to free-market principles. In that respect, our deal cements Rio Tinto into the free-market system. </p> <p>'I think Europe would view Australia or Canada as a raw materials supplier a little bit differently than they view Russia. The demeanour is different, the relationship is different. I think if I extrapolate from what is happening in energy, it is interesting to think about that in raw materials.' </p> <p>Mining companies have traditionally been viewed as dirty, exploitative corporate bogeymen, but nowadays they are keen to be seen as socially responsible. How does Kloppers deal with the issue of doing business with China amid the furore over human rights? 'It is a tough one. China has pulled so many people from poverty - I think that is important as well. Our challenges are about where we source things; you have to be so careful you don't run foul of sweatshops or child labour. That is probably the thing I worry about quite a bit. I can't change the practices of my clients who buy raw materials, but I can change the practices of people I buy from.'</p> <p>There are concerns that BHP - and Rio - could be hit if the rate of Chinese growth has peaked. Kloppers concedes that China will be affected by the credit crunch, but believes that its underlying momentum is unstoppable.</p> <p>'You can't argue that the West slowing down is positive for China. Net exports are about 10 per cent of the economy and they are suffering. But I do think China is a big beast; for the first time since America entered the industrial age we have an economy that has a local market of scale. China has slowed down itself, but the desire to become rich before they grow old is very strong. </p> <p>'They have no choice but to keep their economy going, otherwise they are going to get that demographic day when their workforce starts declining and they can't support their pensioners. India has much less of a problem because they had no one-child policy.</p> <p>'That makes me very positive that this growth will continue for decades. The Chinese have a huge amount of infrastructure yet to build. The basic driver is bigger houses as you become more affluent. The Chinese want the same size house as their Western counterparts.'</p> <p>Kloppers is fascinating on the broader questions facing the mining industry, but cannot resist talking about the bid for long: 'This deal is about relative value. We are proposing that their shareholders stay in and grab a piece of the extra value we can create by putting things together.

  "<p>Roger Hiorns is unconventional. Most people, when faced with a derelict housing estate in one of the grimier parts of south London, would empty their pockets of valuables and reach for the nearest stab-proof vest. Hiorns, however, decided it was perfectly reasonable to pour 90,000 litres of copper sulphate solution into an empty bedsit in the name of art.</p> <p>'It's been a slightly surreal summer,' says the 33-year-old artist as he walks about the site in a camouflage jacket and skinny jeans. He blinks at me through tortoiseshell Michael Caine spectacles. 'The tenants' association who lent us the building seemed quite happy with a lot of chemicals on their doorstep.'</p> <p>Seizure is the latest urban-landscape commission by Artangel, the innovative art organisation behind some of the most memorable work of the last decade, including Rachel Whiteread's House (1993) and Antony Gormley's 25-metre-high Waste Man (2006).</p> <p>Over a 10-week period, Hiorns has transformed an end-of-the-line council flat, due for demolition, into an ambitious art installation in the heart of Elephant and Castle. It was a complicated process, more like a giant schoolboy chemistry experiment than a delicately crafted artwork.</p> <p>First, a hole was drilled in the floor of the upstairs flat. Then, giant plastic containers of copper sulphate were poured through it into a sealed tank constructed to occupy the dimensions of the bedsit below. The solution was left to cool at an ambient temperature of 20C to form into bright blue crystals. </p> <p>At least, that was the theory. If the temperature had not been kept stable or if the weather had been unseasonably hot, Hiorns would have been left with a pile of powdery sediment and a bedsit flooded with toxic chemicals (copper sulphate is more commonly used as a pesticide for vines).</p> <p>'What we've found building this piece is that we've basically built a massive lack of control,' says Hiorns, a graduate of Goldsmiths who has previously exhibited in Tate Britain and the Cubitt Gallery, London. 'I wanted to use a material that would take me out of the equation. Copper sulphate makes its own aesthetic and that makes me, the artist, disappear. I like working with that ambiguity.'</p> <p>Today is the first day anyone has been able to examine the results. So I find myself in a deserted corner of Harper Road, SE1, a place of boarded-up windows, concrete and rusted playground swings. But as I walk through a doorway of the left-hand corner flat, the environment is suddenly transformed into a sparkling secret grotto. Inside the walls, floors and ceilings are covered with stalactites of luminescent, hyacinth blue. The bath is overgrown with jewel-like shards of alien coral.</p> <p>'It's a sort of lapis lazuli colour,' says Hiorns. 'Yves Klein always comes up but I noticed it was actually like the blue lights on police car sirens.'</p> <p>And yet, despite the work's toxic, destructive nature, I can't help but be smitten with its unexpected beauty; nestling like glittering treasure in the concrete heart of the city.</p>",
  "<p>The balance of economic and financial power is shifting from developed economies in the West to emerging economies, led by China and India, and including commodity producers such as Brazil and Russia, and countries in Asia and the Middle East with large savings.</p> <p>The recent global economic boom already reflects this, with emerging economies not only growing strongly but heavily influencing conditions in the West. Cheap goods from China, often produced by Western firms, helped to keep global inflation down ahead of the recent surge in commodity prices, and savings flowed 'uphill' from Asia and the Middle East to the US, allowing that country to live beyond its means, as seen by its huge trade deficit.</p> <p>These imbalances are unwinding and, along with the credit crunch, point to a painful adjustment for the West. The UK faces recession and needs to resolve many issues, not least how to position itself in this changing global landscape.</p> <p>First, the shift in economic power is set to continue. This is highlighted by the pace and scale of change in China. Beijing spent more on the Olympics than the five previous cities put together, but it was a drop in the ocean for them. Across China, the private sector has been let loose. Yet, not all the investment taking place there is as productive as it should be, and China lacks the institutional set-up and policy tools it needs to control the boom.</p> <p>There is a similar challenge in other countries and one should expect increased volatility. The trend may be up, but the business cycle still exists. Indeed, over the next year, growth in emerging economies including China and India should slow. Yet, any downturn is more likely to be seen as a temporary pause in a super-growth cycle.</p> <p>Strong, underlying forces are at work. Quite literally, an industrial revolution is taking place. It is seen in China now. India will be next as, with its young population, it moves into manufacturing, and it is not uncommon to hear people talk about Africa's future potential in mass manufacturing.</p> <p>The challenge in many regions is to generate jobs for a huge swathe of both skilled and unskilled workers, and this explains why there is huge investment and an infrastructure boom around the world; investment not just in roads and bridges but in soft infrastructure, aimed at boosting educational, scientific, language and technical skills. There is a desire to move up the value curve and become knowledge-based economies, directly challenging us.</p> <p>This also explains why many countries are developing their financial markets. Already in the City there is talk of competition from Dubai. In turn, tax competition is becoming a reality as countries seek to attract international firms and highly skilled workers. The UK must rise to these challenges, dealing with skills problems, investing more heavily in its science base and retaining its competitive edge with the right mix of tax and regulation.</p> <p>The balance of financial power is already shifting. Sovereign wealth funds are a clear example of this. The bulk of these government-controlled funds are in the Middle East and Asia, and were established to build up assets on behalf of the state. They have shot to attention as the number of countries with such funds is rising, the amounts at their disposal are huge and their potential targets more controversial. Already this year, these sovereign funds have come to the rescue of some banks and financial firms in the US and UK, injecting much-needed capital.</p> <p>Emerging economies are embracing this shift in financial firepower. When I visited Brazil this year, I found many who felt that a recession in America would not affect them but that one in China would hurt. Only five years ago across east Asia it was common to hear complaints about China's competitive threat. Now it is seen as a growth opportunity, a market to sell into. Intra-Asian trade has soared, as has trade between Asia and the Middle East, Africa and Latin America.</p> <p>These new trade corridors reflect increased flows of goods and commodities, of people and remittances, and of portfolio and direct investment. Eventually this will have negative consequences for the dollar, despite its recent bounce, and it could change geopolitics as emerging regions work together.</p> <p>In this environment, energy security has already become a key issue. Water and food security may be next. There is insatiable global demand for commodities. More than two thirds of the incremental demand for oil in recent years came from Russia, the Gulf and China. There has been a step-change in energy use that supply will struggle to keep pace with. For instance, if China was to move to half the car usage of Europe, it would need all the cars currently in existence in both the US and Europe.</p> <p>Russia and Saudi Arabia are important for Europe's energy needs, and Europe must compete for that energy with China. Over recent years Saudi and Russia have courted one another, even signing an arms agreement this year. This would have been unthinkable eight years ago.</p> <p>It is not just oil. China's involvement across Africa is huge, and commodities are the reason. Across Africa, one only hears China and the US mentioned, despite Europe being Africa's biggest trading partner. Which makes one wonder whether Europe needs more strategic thinking on issues such as energy; and whether the shift in economic and financial power will trigger a shift in the balance of military and political power.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Dr Gerard Lyons is chief economist at Standard Chartered, William Keegan is away</p>",
  "<p>Equity investors are not alone in closely monitoring the performance of banks: the fate of bond fund managers is also closely linked to how these financial institutions will fare over the next six months or so. </p> <p>Opinions between fund managers vary sharply. Indeed, the level of exposure to banks has been a key determinant of bond-fund performance: those who decided that the US Federal Reserve's rescue of Bear Sterns in March marked the nadir for bank bonds and duly piled in have done badly. After a brief fillip, prices continued to fall, while funds such as M&amp;G's European Corporate Bond fund, which have resisted the temptation to buy bonds, have had a good year. </p> <p>Opinions on banks still vary wildly. Managers such as James Foster at Artemis and Nick Hayes at New Star think bank bonds are 'cheap and attractive'. Cheap they certainly are: the yield on the bonds issued by some of our biggest banks is as high as 12 per cent, a level usually associated with basket-case companies poised to default. Yet, as Hayes points out, shareholders in Bear Sterns and Northern Rock may have lost their shirts when they were rescued by the US and UK governments, but bond holders have continued to receive their payments and, barring a global meltdown, should have their capital repaid when it falls due. </p> <p>However, a couple of weeks ago, Kenneth Rogoff, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, warned that the bad news was far from over. He predicted that a banking 'whopper' - a large investment or commercial bank - would go under within a few months. And the risk is growing that US home-loan giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will effectively be nationalised. </p> <p>Jim Leaviss, head of retail and institutional fixed interest at M&amp;G, says that if a top-10 bank fails, the poor state of many governments' finances means they may not be able to keep on organising rescues: 'They can do it once or twice, but they can't keep on doing it.' </p> <p>He also believes that the banks' own performances could deteriorate further, even though many are already suffering losses: 'The banks have got into this state before we are even in a recession. By the year-end, all industrial economies could be in or nearing recession, so banks' customers will start defaulting.' </p> <p>Leaviss also questions the conventional wisdom that bank bonds are immune from default, pointing out that there are at least three layers of bonds, and that while the first two may be secure, the third layer often have clauses allowing a suspension of interest payments if, for example, the bank stops paying a dividend. </p> <p>Over at Artemis, Foster thinks the price falls that have already affected bank bonds could spread to other industries. He points out that there have been few new issues so far, but that fund-raisings are likely to rise as banks cut back on the facilities they offer to corporate clients. 'When they do come, companies will be shocked at the price we [bond investors] will charge,' he adds. These high rates will feed through to existing bonds, causing their prices to fall, which Foster says has already happened in the US after new issues such as that by insurer AIG. </p> <p>Foster is wary about predicting how long the uncertainty will last - 'I expect at least six months more' - and thinks that funds that can only buy corporate bonds will be in an uncomfortable place. His own strategic bond fund can buy a mix of assets - it has 10 per cent in government bonds and a further 50 per cent in investment-grade or highest-quality bonds, most of which are banks. </p> <p>Leaviss also prefers government bonds, which have recovered sharply as investors have begun to bet that the inflationary spike could be ending as oil prices start to fall. John Pattullo, bond fund manager at Henderson, agrees: 'The market thinks inflation will peak next month or the month after. That means interest rates could start to fall, and that is good for bonds.' </p> <p>Bond funds are offering decent yields at the moment - M&amp;G's European Corporate Bond fund is offering a conservative 4.15 per cent, but Artemis's Strategic Bond offers almost 7 per cent, while New Star's High Yield Bond is over 8 per cent. Tim Cockerill, head of research at Rowan, likes the New Star corporate bond fund as well as Invesco Perpetual's corporate bond fund and says that, on a 12-month view, these may be producing good returns. But if Leaviss and Foster are right, the capital value of these funds could fall further and, with many building society accounts offering more than 6 per cent, it may be too early to invest. </p> <p>Bond fund managers may think inflation has peaked, but that does not mean it has gone away. After years in which prices of everything from milk to microwaves have fallen, it may be time to come to terms with paying more for basic commodities. Companies, too, are facing higher costs, which could mean lower profits and therefore lower returns for investors. </p> <p>Aruna Karunathilake, manager of Fidelity's UK Aggressive fund, has identified companies that could benefit from rising prices, and others that are insulated from their effects. His largest holding is in Royal Dutch Shell - an obvious beneficiary of high oil prices - but he also looks for companies that will benefit indirectly, such as German fertiliser producer K&amp;S. </p> <p>Some companies are effectively immune from price pressure, such as National Grid, whose regulatory regime means that its own revenues are linked to inflation, while others, such as Tesco, are able to pass on price rises to customers.</p>",
  "<p>The last thing you might contemplate doing with your money at the moment is gambling it. Yet one of the safest places to put your cash in the middle of the economic storm is into the Premium Bonds 'lottery'. </p> <p>The bonds were introduced in 1956 by Harold Macmillan, when he was Chancellor of the Exchequer, in a bid to encourage people to save in a still austere Britain. However, they received a frosty reception from the church and other critics worried about Britain becoming a nation of gamblers; the then shadow Chancellor, Harold Wilson, labelled it a 'squalid raffle'.</p> <p>But more than 50 years on, Premium Bonds are increasingly popular. 'They are guaranteed by the government, and in the current volatile investment environment, the security offered may, at least initially, look attractive,' says Frans van den Berg of independent financial adviser Punter Southall. 'This is especially true when coupled with the fact the bonds are tax-free and easily accessible.'</p> <p>The state-backed investment lottery is run by National Savings &amp; Investments (NS&amp;I), which offers two monthly \u00a31m jackpots, as well as a pile of other cash prizes ranging from \u00a350 to \u00a3100,000.</p> <p>'Instead of paying interest, the bonds are entered into a monthly prize draw,' says NS&amp;I spokeswoman Gill Stephens. \"The minimum investment is \u00a3100 and the maximum is \u00a330,000, and anyone over 16 can buy Premium Bonds. They can also be bought for a child by a parent, grandparent or great-grandparent.'</p> <p>You can buy the bonds online (<a href=\"http://www.nsandi.com\">nsandi.com</a>), by phone (0500 007 007), or at the Post Office. Each month, the winning numbers are picked by Ernie - the Electronic Random Number Indicator Equipment.</p> <p>'The first two matching numbers win the \u00a31m jackpots, while other numbers are allocated smaller sums,' says Stephens. 'Since the first draw in 1957, more than 176 million prizes worth \u00a311.3bn have been paid out, and since the jackpot was introduced in 1994, 216 millionaires have been created.'</p> <p>Given that there are currently more than 23 million investors who collectively have \u00a336bn in Premium Bonds, their popularity cannot be disputed. But while the prizes themselves are tax-free, the bonds do not earn interest, meaning that if you never win a prize, your investment could depreciate in real terms.</p> <p>NS&amp;I is quick to point to what it dubs the 'prize fund rate' - equivalent to an interest rate of 3.4 per cent a year; this 'nominal rate' is calculated by working out one month's interest on the total value of all eligible Premium Bonds in the draw. But the odds aren't that great, as with 'average luck' the chances of winning any one prize with one bond are 22,000-1, while the odds of winning the jackpot with any single bond are a massive 18 billion-1. Last month, apart from the lucky millionaires, there were 1.6 million winning bonds, ranging from \u00a3100,000 to \u00a350.</p> <p>Nonetheless, unlike other bets, such as the National Lottery, you do not lose your stake and if your bonds don't win one month, you go into the next monthly draw - plus, you can withdraw your money at any time. </p> <p>While Premium Bonds retain the lure of the \u00a31m payout, if you're looking for a reliable investment vehicle with regular income and guaranteed returns on your money, you will almost certainly do better by squirrelling your spare cash away elsewhere.</p> <p>'Currently the \"prize rate\" is equal to 3.4 per cent, but this is net of tax, and is equivalent to 4.25 per cent for a basic-rate taxpayer and 5.66 per cent for a higher-rate taxpayer,' says Anna Sofat from IFA Addidi Wealth. 'If you take inflation into account, which can soon erode the value of your holding, the returns don't look so attractive.'</p> <p>That said, she adds: 'Your money is safe as you are, in effect, lending it to the government, no bad thing in the current environment. I have no problem with people having money in Premium Bonds, but wouldn't advocate taking up the full \u00a330,000 allowance right now.'</p> <p>Crucially, you must remember that the 3.4 per cent 'average prize return' can easily be topped by a whole host of traditional savings accounts, says Jason Witcombe from IFA Evolve Financial Planning. For example, you can currently earn more than 6 per cent on a mini-cash individual savings account, into which you can put \u00a33,600 tax-free. Alternatively, you could get up to 6.51 per cent with an internet savings account from Bradford &amp; Bingley or 6.4 per cent with the easy access deposit account from Anglo Irish Bank.</p> <p>Witcombe agrees that if you want to buy Premium Bonds, you need to 'do it for fun. That said, they are certainly a better alternative to the National Lottery, and can be a reasonable investment for higher-rate taxpayers. And there's always the chance that you could win the big prize.'</p> <p>If you have built up a healthy rainy day fund elsewhere, there's no harm in having a punt. You might just come home from work to find a fat cheque on the doormat - or, better still, open the door to one of the Agent Millionaires saying you've scooped the jackpot.</p>",
  "<p>I like to come into my workspace and feel it's a living environment and not frozen, which is why I often change or add to the pictures on the wall. I use them to create the atmosphere of whichever book I'm working on. Sometimes I layer over things and then find them underneath later, like an old chapter plan, or lists, or dates and histories. It's much less efficient than having it on a proper file but I like it this way. </p> <p>I've always thought it was important not to attach too much superstition to the space where you're writing, because once you get into the mindset that you can only do it a certain way in a certain place, your creativity can get blocked.

  "<p>Today's one-day international at Lord's has a most unusual feel to it. We are anticipating a celebration of England's cricketing renaissance. It is not often that we have been able to say that about England's one-day team. But the manner in which they have defeated the South Africans in the past three games has changed the landscape. No one will be surprised if England win again today. </p> <p>There are the usual caveats about the transformation. The South Africans look tired, homesick and demoralised. Their inspirational captain is wounded. It is just as well for them that the Champions Trophy has been postponed for a year. Indeed this postponement now seems a pity from an English perspective. The way in which Kevin Pietersen's side have performed, we might have fancied their chances of a first-ever global one-day trophy had the tournament taken place in Pakistan this September. </p> <p>But there has been a transformation. The personnel of this England team is not so different to the one that succumbed lamely, 3-1, to New Zealand earlier in the summer. You may have noticed that there is a new captain and Andrew Flintoff has returned; so has Matt Prior; Steve Harmison has come out of retirement; Samit Patel has been 'discovered'. But the new faces alone do not completely explain a metamorphosis that has us thinking that England may suddenly be ranked No 2 in the world. That will be the case if they take this series 5-0.</p> <p>England are playing with freedom and a smile. Pietersen must take much of the credit for that. And so must the senior players. A key element in international cricket is defusing the tension and this may not be Peter Moores' strongest point. I can recall many years ago being surprised at the levity, albeit contrived, of my first appearances in an England dressing room. If it wasn't Ian Botham then it might be JK Lever or Allan Lamb doing their best to relieve the tension. They weren't just being daft. They wanted to relax themselves and everyone else. </p> <p>With Harmison and Flintoff reunited, there is scope for the senior men to show the way in this regard. In 2005 there was Johnny Cash belting out his stuff in the dressing room throughout the Ashes series. I don't know how the old boys (Flintoff is now the oldest at 30) are relaxing the others in this series, but it is blatantly obvious how they are helping out Pietersen on the field. 'I just have to click my fingers and I can summon up a 90mph bowler at the top of his game,' says England's captain, whose honeymoon continues. </p> <p>The resurgence of Harmison and the rehabilitation of Flintoff are key factors in England's success. It's not so easy - in English conditions - to slog this pair around in the middle overs. We knew they could bowl. However, the emergence of Patel is something of a revelation. </p> <p>We knew he could bat, but his bowling in the first and third ODIs against South Africa has produced remarkable figures. In many ways his debut effort was more impressive than his five for 41 at The Oval. The match was in the balance at Leeds; on Friday England were already in charge and the South Africans were desperate when he came on to bowl. But he mopped up very competently.</p> <p>It seems that Patel can bowl better than Ian Blackwell in one-day cricket; he is certainly more nimble in the field (note that running catch at The Oval) and he has the potential to be an international batsman. If he can gain more experience as a bowler with Nottinghamshire, then his career prospects become brighter still.</p> <p>Already he can anticipate a potential Stanford bonanza and a trip to India as a member of the one-day team. In the subcontinent, where the pacemen can be so easily neutered, Patel might be expected to augment his county colleague, Graeme Swann, in the best XI. Moreover, the selectors could seriously consider Patel for the Test squad as well. He is now in the mix for an auxiliary batting slot alongside Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara.</p> <p>It can be dangerous to draw too many conclusions about the Test side from one-day performances. Even so, Prior's return to international cricket in the past week has been so impressive that it must now be a formality that he will replace Tim Ambrose behind the stumps in Test cricket.</p> <p>Indeed the number of changes between the Test team and the ODI side is reducing by the week - especially now that Harmison has rediscovered his desire to play with the white ball. It is possible that Andrew Strauss and Monty Panesar will be the only Test 'specialists' in India. </p> <p>Which is not great news for Michael Vaughan, who must be looking on at England's recent successes with great delight - of course - but even more bewilderment. Vaughan wants to come back. He has pointed out that his Test record is best against India, West Indies, Sri Lanka and Australia, the four sides who happen to be on the horizon for England. But the obstacles are mounting. Bluntly, he needs double centuries for Yorkshire and a few broken bones elsewhere.</p>",
  "<p>Ever since humankind learnt to read and write, we have nursed a hunger for books that tell us how to live. The original advice and self-improvement books, the sacred texts of the major religions, may not have claimed to offer instant happiness, nor to make us richer, thinner and younger-looking, but they did at least furnish us with a set of rules for a good life. The desire for instruction manuals for living remains strong. Self-help and advice is one of the biggest genres in publishing, netting over \u00a350m per annum in the UK for the past four years. Books such as Paul McKenna's series, I Can Make You Thin/Rich/Confident/Smug, regularly break out of the specialist sections of bookshops and reign supreme over the mainstream bestseller charts. McKenna has sold 2m copies in the UK alone.</p> <p>Yet the genre suffers from the same conundrum as diet books: if any self-help book worked, no further titles would be needed and the industry would grind to a halt. The best example is the late Allen Carr, who followed his bestselling The Easy Way to Stop Smoking with The Only Way to Stop Smoking Permanently, inadvertently implying that he had sold you short with the earlier book. The exception may be the recently published Up for Renewal by Cathy Alter (Atria Books), a memoir of how she transformed her life by spending a year obeying the self-help pages of women's magazines. Alter's book opens up the alarming prospect of a whole new meta-genre: books giving advice on how to follow the advice of advice books. </p> <p>Self-help books generally draw their precepts from three main sources: religion and spirituality (often borrowing heavily from a version of pop-Zen); psychology; and, increasingly, business. A recent favourite of mine in the latter category is Rachel Greenwald's imperious-sounding Find A Husband After 35 Using What I Learned At Harvard Business School. The title was modified to After 30 for the UK edition, presumably because British women age less presentably - or get desperate sooner. </p> <p>There is also a sub-genre based on sheer out-there loopiness, as personified by Barbel Mohr's Cosmic Ordering Service (Mobius). Famously endorsed by Noel Edmonds in 2005, the book claims you can get whatever you want by 'ordering' it from the cosmos, which you visualise as a sort of giant Argos (you can place your orders at <a href=\"http://www.thecosmicorderingsite.com\">thecosmicorderingsite.com</a>). The idea that you can attract health, wealth and happiness to you merely by wishing for them is taken to the ultimate extreme by Rhonda Byrne's bestseller The Secret (Simon &amp; Schuster), which draws together centuries of esoteric thinking and distils them into such nuggets as: 'Love yourself in every moment that you can' and: 'Know that there is no such thing as incurable.' The Secret is, in a sense, the Ur-self-help book; it promises instant wealth, love and weight loss and claims these goals can be achieved by visualising them, bypassing the more tried and tested methods of hard work, effort and exercise. It has sold 7.5m copies worldwide. </p> <p>The Secret's success reflects the global nature of the genre; if you find a formula that works, it can be rolled out practically anywhere. But there is also evidence that self-help conforms to national taste. A scan of the UK pop psychology and self-help bestseller list for mid-August revealed a marked preference for no-nonsense advice books, such as Janet Street-Porter's Life's Too F***king Short (at number 4), a splendid anthology of suggestions for self-assertion that is the nearest most of us will get to being slapped around the face by Janet in person. </p> <p>Autumn and the new year are the high points in the self-help publishing calendar, as we take stock and attempt to get ourselves back in shape after the holiday indulgences. In search of a life-changing mantra, I set out to work my way through the newest crop of advice books. I began with high hopes for Ursula James's <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781846051982\">You Can Think Yourself Thin </a>(Century \u00a39.99), although the title was a turn-off. Twenty years ago, when I was a teenager, diet books all used the word 'slim'; 'thin' and 'skinny' had connotations of illness. Now they all have titles such as I Can Make You Thin, You Can Be Thin and Skinny Bitch</p> <p>Like McKenna, James bases her method on hypnosis and the book comes with a CD in which she leads you into three sessions of therapy. It's surprisingly effective; in the first session, I fell asleep and dreamt I was Will Smith in Independence Day and woke up feeling remarkably refreshed. </p> <p>Since my conscious mind can't remember the hypnosis, I don't even know if she was asking me to visualise myself as Will Smith (he is pretty buff) or if this was coincidence. The hypnosis is intriguing and the book offers a broader scope than most diet books; it concentrates on the connection between overeating and negative emotions. James explains that it takes 21 days to form a habit and the third hypnosis session is designed to be repeated over three weeks, so I will have to wait for the results.</p> <p>In the meantime, I turned to <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780141017822\">A New Earth </a>by Eckhart Tolle (Penguin \u00a312.99), author of the international bestseller The Power of Now. A New Earth was Oprah's Book Club choice earlier this year and it makes The Secret look like hard science. Tolle tells us how to shift from 'egoic' to 'new' consciousness; to do this you need to accept his notion of Enlightenment (don't think Rousseau and Voltaire), an ill-defined casserole of transcendent religions. Tolle, like many a self-help author, anticipates cynicism and pre-empts it; if the book does nothing for you, he explains, it's because you're not 'spiritually mature' enough to understand it. </p> <p>Depressed by Tolle's inanities, I moved on - briefly - to Joel Osteen's <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781847371102\">Become a Better You</a> (Simon &amp; Schuster \u00a312.99). Osteen, with his frighteningly immobile smile, is the pastor of America's biggest church, in Houston, which clearly gives him some authority in the self-improvement game in the US (the book advance alone netted him $13m). It proposes seven 'simple yet effective' steps to finding one's life purpose and becoming happier, calmer and more sane. But since a God-based set of instructions holds little to inspire an entrenched atheist, I decided to forfeit the prospect of 'becoming a better me' in favour of 'being the person I really want to be', the subtitle of Jamil Qureshi's <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780091923570\">The Mind Coach </a>(Vermilion \u00a310.99)</p> <p>Here, at last, was a book that offered some practical suggestions for getting yourself together, based on the tenets of cognitive behavioural therapy. Though the illustrative case histories are long-winded, the chapters are broken down into short, snappy sections that suggest practical exercises ('Learning From Life', 'Working the Confidence Muscle', 'Embracing Your Fear'). Qureshi's method is to help you change your behaviour in tiny increments, in the belief that changing bad habits will in turn break negative thoughts. </p> <p>Cognitive therapy has become the dominant form of treatment for depression and anxiety disorders because it works by encouraging people to look in detail at how they respond to situations and how those reactions can be changed. It makes sense that the self-help books that work most effectively are those that use the same techniques, offering readers real examples to follow and measurable steps to take - books such as The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen R Covey (first published in 1989), or the excellent Manage Your Mind: The Mental Fitness Guide by Gillian Butler and Tony Hope, reissued in a new edition last year and, for me, one of the best examples of the genre. Yet the hunger for quick fixes and magic bullets remains, especially if it's dressed up in quasi-spiritual language, giving any self-appointed guru the opportunity to make millions from the credulous. Alchemists and snake-oil salesmen have been peddling potions to bring health, wealth and beauty for centuries. These days, they come in book form with accompanying CDs and we go on hoping, irrationally, that there may be something in it this time. </p> <p>Fortunately, you can now take the opportunity to write a bestseller about how such self-help books changed your life, and if it makes enough money, follow it up with an advice book about how to get rich by writing a memoir about advice books and so on until you die. The audience will always be out there.</p> <h2>Words of advice: Classic self-help books</h2> <p><strong>The Road Less Travelled by M Scott Peck (1978)</strong><br>A paean to the power of discipline in overcoming life's essential hardship.</p> <p><strong>Women Who Love Too Much by Robin Norwood (1986)</strong><br>'If being in love means being in pain, this book was written for you'.</p> <p><strong>Feel the Fear and Do it Anyway by Susan Jeffers (1988)</strong> 'You can drop an awful lot of excess baggage if you learn to play with life instead of fight it.'</p> <p><strong>Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus by John Gray (1992)</strong> <br>A guide to the yawning gulf between the sexes.</p> <p><strong>The Rules by Ellen Fein and Sherrie Schneider (1995)</strong><br>Contains such pearls as: 'Don't stare at men or talk too much.'</p>",
  "<p>Is it too late to save Eric Pickles from himself? By rights, the popular architect of the Tory victory in Crewe and Nantwich should not have much longer to wait before he becomes chairman of his party, replacing Caroline Spelman (victim of unfortunate mix-up involving public money and her children's nanny). When they were invited to pick a fantasy chairman to preside over the party conference, visitors to the Conservative Home website recently offered Pickles their overwhelming support, with 52 per cent of the vote.</p> <p>What possessed them? Although the poll was held a few weeks before shadow health spokesman Andrew Lansley declared that fat people have no excuses for their behaviour, that does not exonerate the Pickleites, who must already have been well aware of David Cameron's engagement with fat politics, from his concerns about chocolate oranges and undisguised disgust for those who eat too many of them. </p> <p>'We talk too much about people being \"at risk of obesity\" instead of talking about people who eat too much and take too little exercise,' he said, in his celebrated attack on moral failure in the broken (except for Boris Johnson's bit) society. </p> <p>So the time has long passed since Pickles could claim that he is just big-boned. Did his supporters not consider, in their enthusiasm, what message the choice of an obese-looking party chairman would send out to fat people who must learn, as Lansley re-emphasised, last week, that 'the buck stops with them. They can't shuffle off the responsibility'? </p> <p>Although his party has not, as yet, completed the downloadable table which will tell us, at a glance, the body mass index of every sitting Tory MP, it must be clear, even to non-dieticians, that Pickles's figure betrays him as exactly the type of person whose slack, self-deluding, ultimately irresponsible behaviour must cease, before the country is flattened by their collective weight. </p> <p>'Changing our culture is not easy or quick,' Cameron warned. 'You cannot do it top-down. But you can give a lead.' The wonder is that Pickles has not followed it already. But conference is still four weeks away. That leaves ample time, on the No Excuses diet, for him to rediscover his bikini body.</p> <p>Week One. Goal: re-education. This is when Pickles should completely undress and take a good, hard look at himself in the mirror. How did he get here? It's not good enough to blame lack of tone on the influence of obese friends and colleagues, such as Nicholas Soames or Lord Strathclyde. 'Peer pressure and social norms are powerful influences on behaviour,' says top dietician Lansley, 'and they are classic excuses.'</p> <p>Week Two. Goal: healthy eating. And where better to find nutritious inspiration than in the fantastic Unilever range of products? In his No Excuses speech, Lansley announced that Dave Lewis, chairman of Unilever UK, is to chair the Tories' new 'Responsibility Deal' on public health. </p> <p>For breakfast, Dave, who graduated in something or other from Trent Polytechnic, recommends a yummy Magnum, as advertised by slender Hollywood actress Eva Longoria. 'Did you know,' he says, 'that, eaten sensibly, ice cream can be part of a healthy balanced diet?' Yet another reason, as the food industry has been arguing, to abandon the stigmatising traffic light labelling system. Isn't it much fairer on ice cream to stigmatise people instead? </p> <p>Lunch: Eric should choose from Unilever's range of tasty Pot Noodles; just one will supply around 25 per cent of his daily recommended sodium allowance! His light evening meal could be anything from the Unilever list, from a delicious bowlful of Hellman's mayonnaise to a comforting cup of Bovril (assuming the source of the recent salmonella outbreak has now been identified). </p> <p>Week Three. Goal: enjoy exercise! Eric will find out how fun and exciting this can be if he tunes into CBeebies' LazyTown, featuring the Tories' favourite keep-fit instructor, Sportacus. This character is mentioned so often in connection with Tory health plans that you might easily get the impression that Sportacus, Cameron and Lansley are collaborators. But that would mean helping fat people, and as Sportacus creator Magnus Scheving says: 'LazyTown does not align itself with political parties.' </p> <p>Week Four. Goal: developing self-esteem. By now, Eric will be admiring his new curves and wondering how he could ever have fallen for the line, promulgated by the authors of last year's Foresight survey, that the UK's adiposity explosion is related to conditions in the 'obesogenic society'. </p> <p>A top priority in Lansley's No Excuses programme is to keep the public away from that kind of damaging misinformation. 'Tell people that biology and the environment cause obesity,' he warns, 'and they are offered the one thing we have to avoid: an excuse.' So even if Pickles already knows about the dire consequences of dietary abundance, human biology and a sedentary lifestyle, please don't mention this to any other Tory MPs who might use it as an excuse not to shed pounds of unattractive flab.</p> <p>It's hard to judge, at this early stage, how the Cameron anti-fat campaign compares, in hostage-to-fortune terms, with John Major's back to basics. Even supposing there are fewer extremely fat Tories than priapic and/or corrupt ones, there could still be morale implications for his plumper backbenchers, struggling for survival in the party of the thin. How long before some sobbing junior minister describes the horror of the constant weighing and hurtful criticism from party whips? At least fashion's size zeros get to be supermodels. </p> <p>Far riskier, however, is the possible impact of insulting one quarter - the obese section - of the adult population. Last week's map of obesity 'hot spots' suggests that not all of these potentially offended people are the deprived inhabitants of guaranteed Labour seats (supposing such places still exist). There are quite a few inexcusably obese people, it turns out, in Tory seats like Kensington and Chelsea. And, as much as the careers of Gillian McKeith and Anne Diamond reveal a surprising tolerance, on the public's part, for dietary advisers who may be unqualified, unhinged or five stone overweight, it seems to draw the line at abuse. </p> <p>Jamie Oliver is unlikely, ever, to regain the popularity he enjoyed before he put on a fat suit and advertised his moral superiority over the 'fucking arseholes' and 'tossers' who feed their children badly. And Oliver, at least, offered recipes with this analysis. The Tories' intentionally arm's-length initiatives amount to Cameron's rebukes, Lansley's 'no excuses', the promotion of Unilever's Mr Pot Noodle, and an end to traffic light food labelling. </p> <p>Of course, while obese people remain a minority, their demonisation might turn out to be a terrific vote winner. Easy to spot and fun to tease, they are also the perfect guinea pigs for Cameron's new, bottom-up approach to governance. It might just work. And if it doesn't, there's a perfectly good excuse: it's the fat people's fault, with knobs on. That's something to think about, Eric Pickles.</p>",
  "<p>The science of demographic projection and the art of scaremongering enjoy a relationship akin to that of the sadist and masochist: first comes the threat, then the relish with which the punishment is anticipated. Thus forecasts of increasing population numbers are guaranteed to produce dystopian visions of social collapse.</p> <p>The godfather of apocalyptic demographics was the Rev Thomas Malthus, who famously proposed in the late 18th century that unchecked population growth would lead to starvation. Population, he said, was destined to increase exponentially in relation to food supply. In the event, Britain's population grew from a hungry eight million in Malthus's time to today's well-fed 61 million.</p> <p>The cleric's name long ago became a byword for catastrophic pessimism, but there have been plenty of other doomsayers who have followed in his arithmetically wayward wake. It could be said that a recent editorial in the British Medical Journal emerges from the same tradition. Last month, John Guillebaud, professor of family planning at University College London, called for a reduction in the UK birth rate to help combat global warming.</p> <p>The lesson to be drawn from Malthus, however, is that we should never underestimate the human capacity to misrepresent the future or our ability to deal with it when it does arrive.</p> <p>Nevertheless, if human ingenuity is boundless, the planet and, in particular, that small corner lying off the coast of north-west Europe, is not. There is a finite space in which to fit people. The UK, after all, is significantly smaller than France or Germany.</p> <p>Last week, the European Commission announced its most recent population predictions. Britain came top of the league with an estimated growth in the next 50 years of 16 million people. With a total of 77 million inhabitants, Britain is predicted to become the most populous country in Europe.</p> <p>To those who view the world through a purely economic prism, these figures are a cause for celebration. As the headline in the Guardian put it: 'Germany shrinks, France grows, but UK population booms', making it sound as if Team GB had added a further gold to its Beijing tally, this time in the reproduction event. The paper pointed out that the projected rise meant 'the UK has less to fear about any \"generational wars\" brought on by the \"demographic timebomb\" of ageing and shrinking populations where those in work cannot support the pension needs of retired citizens'.</p> <p>This has become the rationale for the policy of population expansion. To deal with greater life expectancy, runs the theory, we need to produce or, rather, import more people. But it's worth considering where this cycle will end. How, for example, will a population of 77 million deal with paying for the pensions of its retired citizens? Presumably by expanding to 100 million. Then what?</p> <p>Still, let's resist the Malthusian temptation to overdramatise the situation and assume that a larger population will not lead to a global warming crisis, that there won't be a shortage of food or shelter, or an increase in disease. Instead, we can frame the problem in more modest terms: will an increase of 16 million people improve the quality of our lives? Will life become more pleasurable, less anxious, more satisfying?</p> <p>It's impossible to know the future, but there's no excuse for ignoring the present and just now things feel a little cramped in Britain, especially in the south east. Roads are almost permanently clogged, public transport is a mess, schools and hospitals are full and the sense of friction, the tension of reduced personal space, is often palpable. Would these problems be alleviated with another 16 million, the majority of whom would settle in the south?</p> <p>Such is the draw of the south east that the Policy Exchange think-tank recently suggested that the inhabitants of cities such as Sunderland and Liverpool should move there. Neither is there a shortage of economic migrants from across the rest of the world who also view the south east as their destination point. The European Commission estimated that immigrants would account for 10 million of Britain's 16 million increase in numbers.</p> <p>And here we come to the main problem of discussing the benefits and drawbacks of population growth. Immigration is inextricably tied to the issue of race. To wonder if 10 million new migrants is a good thing is to stray into territory most notably occupied by racists. In fact, immigration has become a much more complex matter than race; it's not uncommon, as author Mike Phillips noted last week in these pages, to see black Londoners complaining about the presence of white Poles. None the less, it's a sensitive matter and that's one reason the immigration debate has been restricted to the more neutral ground of economics.</p> <p>Bodies such as the Institute for Public Policy Research maintain there is a net benefit for the economy and there seems little doubt that much of the dynamism of modern Britain is due to the impact of migrants. However, economic success is not the only guide to a nation's health.</p> <p>As one economic migrant, Nemanja Vidic, Manchester United's Serbian defender, observed of the British last week: 'They just don't have time to feel the joy of life. Through the week they all work so hard. They only talk to people at lunch break. Then in the evening they come home and watch the telly so they can get up early for work the next day.'</p> <p>The UK economy has modelled itself on the American version, in which GDP growth and population growth are inseparable. But Britain is not America. There is not a sense of unlimited space on these islands or such a such a strong notion of Darwinian individualism.</p> <p>So the consequences of an entrepreneurial culture based on endless supply of renewable labour are something the nation at large needs to consider and one of those consequences is a population of 77 million.</p> <p>There's nothing wrong with asking, in the spirit of free inquiry, whether that may not be just a little too much.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Nick Cohen is away</p>",
  "<p>A merger between German banking giants Dresdner and Commerzbank will lead to at least 1,200 job losses at Dresdner Kleinwort, the London-based investment bank, according to advisers working on the deal, which is expected to be announced today.</p> <p>Insurance giant Allianz is selling Dresdner, its loss-making banking subsidiary, to Commerzbank and together they will be big enough to challenge Deutsche, Germany's biggest bank. But there will be thousands of job losses at Dresdner's global operations, with around half of the 2,500 staff employed by Dresdner Kleinwort in the City being made redundant. </p> <p>Senior mergers and acquisitions bankers, traders and IT staff will be axed and the name Dresdner Kleinwort will be scrapped as Commerzbank scales down the operation that has lost hundreds of millions in the credit crunch. The offices will be closed and folded into Commerzbank's London operation. Commerzbank is hoping for more than \u00a36bn of cost savings from the whole deal.</p> <p>Kleinwort Benson, whose roots go back to the end of the 19th century, was taken over by Dresdner in 1995 and swallowed by Allianz in 2001, but the marriage has never worked well for the German insurance titan, acting as a drag on earnings, according to analysts. Dresdner has racked up losses of more than \u20ac1bn in recent years, thanks to hefty write-downs linked to poor investment decisions and the credit squeeze. German unions fear that job losses from the deal could top 12,000, at home and abroad, because of branch overlaps and duplication of products and services.</p> <p>Unions have championed a rival bid for Dresdner from China Development Bank, which hinted that it would protect jobs. But the German government of Angela Merkel is thought to have come down against the idea of allowing the Chinese to take over such a large German financial institution.</p> <p>It is thought that Commerzbank will acquire a 51 per cent stake in Dresdner and buy the rest later. The consideration will value Dresdner at about \u00a37.5bn.</p> <p>Analysts say that thousands more City jobs are expected to be cut before the end of the year as banks continue to retrench as the credit crunch enters its second year. Lehman Brothers is thought to be preparing to shed another 1,500. Those layoffs are likely to come before the firm reports third-quarter results next month, with hundreds due to be shed in London. Other banks considering more lay-offs include Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and Royal Bank of Scotland.</p>",
  "<p>When exactly was the moment when a change of government first seemed inevitable? Was it a year ago, when George Osborne made his speech about inheritance tax and Gordon Brown packed away his election plans? Was it when Blair finally decided to give up on New Labour last May? Jesse Norman, the Conservative Party candidate for Hereford, would take it back further, to 29 June 2005 when David Cameron uttered these, not quite memorable, lines: 'We recognise that government doesn't have all the answers, and we instinctively assume the best in people. We trust people. We don't view society from above, like some national project to be managed, directed and monitored. We look at society from the bottom up. Individuals. Families. Communities. Voluntary organisations and faith groups. Businesses. All the complex wonder of a modern, diverse country. We do think there's such a thing as society, we just don't think it's the same thing as the state...'</p> <p>This was Cameron launching his bid to be Tory leader, and making Ken Clarke look old overnight. It was the moment, Norman suggests, when the public first appreciated that crucial possibility: that there might be an alternative. 'People won't change their mind if there is nothing to change it to.' </p> <p>Cameron's choice of venue to launch this speech was as symbolic in retrospect as what he was saying. He was talking at the think tank Policy Exchange, of which Norman was then executive director. Cameron and his team were keen students of the mythology of the rise of New Labour, and they believed that no party rebranding could be complete without an ideas engine to nurture policy and personnel. Blair had had the Institute for Public Policy Research and Demos; Cameron would have Policy Exchange, established three years earlier for that purpose by moderniser-in-chief Francis Maude. </p> <p>In the three years since Cameron's speech, as his star has risen so has that of Policy Exchange (despite the embarrassment of Newsnight's expos\u00e9 of its questionable research into radical Islam, and the recent report suggesting northern cities were doomed). Its staff has increased from 5 to 35, its budget, mostly donations from the City, has grown nearly tenfold. One of its founders, Nick Boles, has become head of policy for Cameron; its former chief researcher, James O'Shaughnessy, is now chief researcher at Tory central office; current director Anthony Browne has just been appointed head of policy for Boris Johnson in London. </p> <p>When Policy Exchange was awarded Prospect magazine's think tank of the year award, a year after Cameron spoke, it was commended for its 'zip' and 'high impact'. Ed Balls MP, then still Economic Secretary at Gordon Brown's Treasury, presented the prize, noting that excellent think tanks were a necessary condition for parties hoping to take power, but, he hoped, not a sufficient one. By the time of this year's Policy Exchange summer party, attended by the entire Cameron court, and a good proportion of New Labour's old entourage, there was a glister of a movement that believed it was winning the argument. The only question that remained was what exactly its argument was. </p> <p>With this in mind, and conference season approaching, I spent the last week asking think tanks if they knew what Cameron was thinking, and what they thought he should be thinking. The most quoted line at the time of that inaugural speech was, 'we do think there is such a thing as society', but in hindsight the first line, Jesse Norman suggests, was as crucial: 'We don't have all the answers'. </p> <p>'I think Cameron is brave to stand up and say he is still coming to a view on certain questions,' Norman argues. 'It takes balls to say, \"We know there is something out there and we don't know what it is yet, but we are finding our way towards it.\"' </p> <p>It's a cop out, too, though, isn't it?</p> <p>'You have to draw a distinction between ideas and a viewpoint,' Norman suggests. 'Ideas come and go, what really matters is an intellectually distinctive viewpoint.' </p> <p>Does Cameron have a new viewpoint in his view?</p> <p>'He has set out the ley lines of a new viewpoint.'</p> <p>Some of Cameron's ley-lined viewpoint is contained in a book Jesse Norman wrote entitled Compassionate Conservatism, published by Policy Exchange. 'The beautiful thing was these ideas we'd been discussing for a long time were suddenly what was required,' Norman says. 'The same thing is about to happen in economics.' He has another book coming out, explaining that. </p> <p>Called? </p> <p>'Compassionate Economics.'</p> <p>Of course. How compassionate, exactly?</p> <p>'Conservatives are currently in the business of replacing the state-versus-individual dichotomy. The new relationship is more like state-versus-individual and many other institutions. Those institutions will be at the core of how we relate to each other on a local level...'</p> <p>Isn't that what New Labour used to call community?</p> <p>'Community is such a loaded term...'</p> <p>And isn't 'compassionate conservatism' a rephrasing of the fabled third way?</p> <p>'The third way is such an empty phrase...'</p> <p>I wonder if Norman sees Policy Exchange as a networking agency as well as an ideas forum. 'I don't see anything that could be described as a \"set\",' he says. 'Just a number of people with a shared viewpoint.' A bunch of people, you might say, in search of a big idea.</p> <p>Just before Beijing I was sitting watching Boris Johnson give a speech to the CBI about the London Olympics. Boris opened with typical blunderbuss bravado. Who, he asked, did they think his political hero was? The CBI, not the most volatile of crowds, sat silent. 'Come on!' roared Boris, with half a smile. 'Who do you think?' There were murmurs of Margaret Thatcher and Genghis Khan. 'I'll tell you,' said Boris eventually. His hero was the mayor in the film Jaws. When the town's population was being eaten by a shark the people rushed to the mayor and asked what he was going to do. What was his policy? The mayor answered that he had no policy, that he was going to do nothing, he was going to leave it to them to sort it out. 'A hero!' Boris declared in triumph.</p> <p>There is something seductive in your big idea being to let others have ideas. It is, as Cameron (and Boris) are keen to suggest, the perfect antidote to the top-down nanny state. The astute Anthony Browne, formerly of The Observer, and the man now charged with concocting Boris's policy of as little policy as possible, is still in his office in Policy Exchange until a successor is appointed. Why has his think tank become so close to Cameron? It's partly, Browne suggests, because in opposition 'they don't have half a million civil servants - or however many it now is - doing their thinking for them'. But despite appearances to the contrary, he insists, Policy Exchange is not a revolving door to Central Office. It also has strong relationships and influence with the government and Nick Clegg's Liberals. </p> <p>'What is extraordinary,' Browne suggests of the current moment, 'is that on a huge range of policy issues there is a great deal of consensus: the big state has run its course; everyone except the old hard left believes you need to introduce more choice and competition into the public sector. The question is how you achieve that.'</p> <p>When I suggest that Cameron (and Boris) are making a virtue of not having defined ideas, but rather having moods and attitudes, Browne says, 'The funny thing is the Conservatives actually have a lot of new policy.' Though when he runs through those new policies - welfare to work, more choice in education, and so on - they have a familiar ring.</p> <p>Over the summer much was made of Cameron's embracing of the idea of Nudge, the readable, much hyped book by the Chicago economists Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstran, that suggests that rather than being told to behave better by politicians it is more effective to 'nudge' (or trick) people into doing so. Thus rather than having an opt-in organ donor card and a big education campaign, it is far more useful to have an opt-out system and rely on people's inertia. This kind of anecdotal marriage of psychology and economics loads the dice in favour of civic virtue without legislating for it. A 'real third way' as its authors inevitably claimed.</p> <p>Will Browne be proposing that Londoners are nudged? </p> <p>'It is certainly fashionable,' he says. 'And it is important to use every tool in the box.'</p> <p>The Fabian Society historically stands for a lot of the possibilities of the planned economy that Policy Exchange derides. Its current director, Sunder Katwala, speaks to me on the phone while exploring a personal version of work-life balance by trying to control his one-year old on his lap. Does he believe that nudging rather than dictating is the way forward? </p> <p>'I think the social responsibility argument that Cameron uses [it's not the government's fault if you are fat] is a clever way of limiting expectations. It allows you to say, two years into office: \"Well, we the government are a little disappointed in you the people.\" You might well want to make a virtue of doing as little as possible in government - Harold Macmillan going to read Jane Austen in the garden of No 10 - but it is also a political reality that if ever anything bad happens then the public demands that the government does something about it. It may be not quite enough to say, \"Well, it's not really our role.\"'</p> <p>What can think tanks contribute? </p> <p>'Public narrative and arguments that link together ideas.'</p> <p>Most good ideas, the American novelist Nicholson Baker once observed, have about the size and complexity of a wheelbarrow. Take the idea of fairness. We probably come to an understanding of what it means at roughly the same age as we understand how a wheelbarrow operates. As a result, fairness is a concept much loved of politicians intent on plain-speaking. Tony Blair, in 2003, when things started to go wrong, vowed to his cabinet that he would submit all of his policies to a 'fairness test'. George Osborne has spent the past week 'campaigning on fairness' making it a 'narrative'. Osborne chose to launch this notion in a speech not at Policy Exchange or the Adam Smith Institute, but at Demos, one of the iconic New Labour think tanks. At the other, the IPPR, Michael Gove, the shadow education secretary, was making claims to that other rather fashionably desired quality 'wellbeing' (expect a speech on that other think tank buzz word 'fraternity' to follow).</p> <p>Richard Reeves, biographer of JS Mill, and cogent theoriser of wellbeing, has just taken over as director of Demos. What does he think Osborne and Gove were up to? 'Well,' he says, 'it is getting harder to tell where a particular idea might be picked up. But let's be honest about this. It serves the Tories' purpose well to have George Osborne at Demos. They are signalling that they are open to ideas from all quarters.'</p> <p>And are they?</p> <p>'Cameron makes a virtue of being a non-ideological politician, all of which makes him as difficult to fathom as Blair. But there will come a point when he will have to answer, for example, how many post offices should we close? And then he could take the Thatcher line - let the market speak - or he might choose to pursue his arguments about social value...' </p> <p>Where the Tories are winning, Reeves believes, however, is in their attitude to ideas. 'On the Conservative side there is huge amount of intellectual energy. Whatever you think about the Nudge thesis the fact is that Thaler came over and the Tories invited him in. Labour just ignored him altogether. It used to be the case that the government policy unit would interrogate someone like that as a matter of course. If you talk to people in the Labour party about ideas for policy at the moment they will say, \"For God's sake, don't tell anyone about this,\" while the Tories don't really mind if their ideas get \"adopted\".' As Osborne suggested in his talk: 'The more that Labour gets started on this agenda, the less work we will have to do on it when we get in.'</p> <p>At Demos, there is perhaps a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu about some of this. While the government is mired in its difficulties, the Tories are using think tanks as their playground just as Blair did while Major was embroiled with the 'bastards' within. In creating their 'new consensus' they are borrowing (or retrieving) many of the opposition's clothes. Geoff Mulgan, co-founder of Demos, can look on perhaps in satisfaction at the way the Tories are moving across tribal lines in their search for policy in the way that he encouraged Blair to do 15 years ago. Mulgan has now himself moved on from the pure 'blue-sky thinking' - fixed-term marriages, legalised drugs and the rest of the original Demos manifesto - that eventually led him all the way to the head of Downing Street's policy unit. He now runs the Young Foundation which he characterises as 'a \"do\" tank rather than a \"think\" tank.' It is, of course - this being Mulgan - the future. </p> <p>'There has been a shift in the way the world works,' he says, ever alert to the new new thing. 'The old think tank days of publishing pamphlets and hoping they will get into a party manifesto are no longer effective. At the Young Foundation we put things into practice. At the moment we have about 35 new organisations under way or starting up, ranging from new ways of providing elder care to new model schools - we are launching several possibilities in America, and in China. We are anti-hype. We tend to quote Harry Truman: \"It is amazing what you can achieve when you don't try to take the credit.\"'</p> <p>In this sense, he suggests, it is not quite so important for the public to find out what Cameron believes as it is for him to discover what works. 'And he gets that point - in the way that most of the commentariat don't, because they are stuck in the printed word.' </p> <p>David Green of the think tank Civitas has also made Mulgan's journey from theory into action. A veteran of both Seventies labour councils and the Eighties free-market Institute for Economic Affairs, Green says: 'We had been talking about it for 20 years, and we thought it was about time we got around to doing it.' Civitas has an experimental primary school and a 'boxing academy' for some of the most challenging teenagers in north London. </p> <p>'We have just had our first GCSE results in,' Green says.

He looks to Richard Reeves's idea of 'character' - set out recently in Prospect - which harks back to Baden-Powell among others, as one way to help restore what he calls the 'de-professionalised' society Labour has created, in which doctors, teachers and the police are able to take less personal responsibility. </p> <p>There was a time when the government's strategy unit under Geoff Mulgan, would invite the likes of Green in to say his piece.

'He seems to rather like a phrase I used many years ago: \"There is such a thing as society but it is different from the state...\"' Green says. </p> <p>Cameron may not have any answers himself but he might know a man who does. 'The solution to many of their problems is just that: experimentation and free inquiry,' Green says. But then, as a think tank director, he would say that wouldn't he?</p>",
  "<p>Oil giant Royal Dutch Shell faces damaging claims over its influence on a supposedly independent environmental audit to determine whether the world's biggest oil and gas project would receive vital bank funding.</p> <p>Dozens of emails released by the government under the Freedom of Information Act show how Shell officials in London attempted to downplay and edit international environmental criticism of the $22bn Sakhalin II energy scheme off the east coast of Russia, which has subsequently been all but fully financed. </p> <p>The exchange reveals anxiety from an unidentified party, thought to be a UK government agency, at how Shell was 'stage managing' the review conducted by AEA Technology, the one-time Atomic Energy Authority, now an environmental consultancy. </p> <p>The report, published last November, was used by banks to assess whether funding Sakhalin II was consistent with environmental and social protocols. </p> <p>Sakhalin II will produce 1.6m tonnes of carbon dioxide - three times the UK's annual carbon footprint. It also threatens the long-term future of the endangered western gray whale as well as rare fish and other wildlife. Shell owns a 27.5 per cent stake in the Sakhalin Energy project, with Russia's Gazprom holding just over 50 per cent.</p> <p>Email exchanges spanning three months and 40 pages show how officials at Shell sought to downplay the significance of a critical Russian environmental audit by persuading AEA to disperse its findings through the report, rather than leaving them in one potentially damning appendix. Questions from a leading environmental group over whether permits were sought before drilling work began were similarly downplayed, as were experts' concerns over the impacts of continuous noise on the critically endangered whale.</p> <p>That Shell, headed by Jeroen van der Veer, seemingly was allowed by the authority to amend the finished report has called into question the independence of the process, claim environmental campaigners. </p> <p>Doug Norlen, policy director of US-based Pacific Environment, said: 'The AEA report lists [Sakhalin Energy] as its client, even though it is meant to be independent. That's bad enough, but Shell stage-managed the whole process. They set the agenda, scheduled meetings and even participated in the editing of sections. I believe this to be a stark and vivid example of manipulation. In addition to skewing the review it destroys the pretence that banks have used ethical considerations before deciding whether to fund the project.'</p> <p>A spokesman for Shell said: 'The opportunity for Sakhalin Energy and its shareholders to provide comments on a draft report of this kind is routine and designed to ensure accuracy. The findings contained in AEA Technology's report are entirely theirs.'</p> <p>An AEA spokesman maintained the report was independent and while Shell and various banks made suggestions it was under no pressure to accept them. 'AEA maintained ownership of the report. In some cases it accepted suggestions and in others it rejected them. AEA stands by its final report in providing an accurate, balanced and independent view of the overall project.'</p> <p>Among banks which have lent Sakhalin II money is Credit Suisse, which advised Gazprom and Shell on the project. It declined to comment.</p> <p>However, the row has deeper significance. Shell is the oil major with the biggest interests in the Arctic. Earlier this year, it controversially spent more than $2bn acquiring drilling leases in Alaska's Chukchi Sea. It is also spending billions exploiting tar sands in Canada, a hugely energy-intensive process. Campaigners say Shell will use audits similar to that of Sakhalin to argue it is taking adequate steps to protect the environment. </p> <p>The 90 billion barrels of oil expected to exist in the Arctic are more than all the known reserves of Nigeria, Kazakhstan and Mexico combined.</p> <p>In recent years Shell has sought to soften its image after seeing its reputation trashed following the murder of Nigerian tribal leader Ken Saro-Wiwa, who was protesting at seeing his homeland damaged by Shell's oil extraction.</p> <p>The firm moved into renewables and placed great store by corporate social responsibility messages. But in the last year, it has seemingly changed tack, ditching renewable energy projects and aggressively bidding for licences in the Arctic, gambling that the world's thirst for oil will outweigh other concerns.</p>",
  "<h2>Obama supporters raised race first</h2> <p>Race undoubtedly remains a strangely sensitive topic in the United States ('Why has Obama stalled? No one mentions race', Focus, last week). Only the naive would have thought this issue would not play a role in the election. </p> <p>But what Paul Harris and many other pundits must keep in mind is that some of Obama's supporters were among the first to raise race as an issue. During the primary season, prominent media personalities repeatedly spoke about the historic nature of electing an African-American as President, and what affect this might have on race relations. It sometimes appeared as though many of Obama's most vocal supporters seemed uninterested in what their candidate was actually saying, but were instead totally involved with the issue of race. </p> <p>This is rather sad considering that race relations never formed a key plank in Obama's platform, but it goes to show that race preoccupies Americans on both the left and right.<br><strong>Christopher Adam</strong><br>Department of History,<br>Carleton University, <br>Ottawa, Canada</p> <h2>The old have a lot to answer for </h2> <p>Margaret Drabble is a great writer and a clear thinker, but her article, 'The old have a powerful role to play.

Category D prisoners are about to be released anyhow and are often out on day-release to do gardening or decorating jobs. This could be extended to category C prisoners, many of whom are in no way dangerous.

Most local libraries don't have a research room or the resources and quiet of the British Library, nor do they aspire to them. If libraries existed with only books and the bygone days that Ms Anderson describes they would cease to exist. But what do I know? The library service I work for (Norfolk) has all the things Ms Anderson seems to loathe yet has the most visited library in the country. <br><strong>Katherine Stephan</strong><br>Norwich</p> <h2>Bolivia is doing just fine</h2> <p>It is a gross exaggeration to suggest that Bolivia is 'edging closer to being a failed state' ('Bolivia split in two as wealthy try to turn back the Morales revolution', World, last week). Failed states do not generally have a President who is supported by 67 per cent of the population and who is able to rely on that mandate to push through much-needed reforms to social and land policies.</p> <p>Also mitigating against the notion of Bolivia being a 'failed state' are the strong ties that Morales is developing with other South American states such as Brazil, Venezuela, Paraguay and Chile. The conflicts are because of his attempt to establish a constitution and political institutions that meet the challenges which this country faces while also seeking to help the 60 per cent of Bolivians living below the poverty line.

  "<p>In a sign that the Olympics feelgood factor has already begun to evaporate, protesters took to the streets of Beijing yesterday in an escalating campaign against the city's biggest dump site, which they claimed was polluting the air with a foul stench and dangerous dioxins. </p> <p>Wearing surgical masks and carrying umbrellas, the mostly young, middle-class campaigners blocked roads, chanted anti-pollution slogans and refused to allow rubbish trucks to pass as dozens of police filmed them and appealed for calm. </p> <p>Residents of the affluent Changying district of east Beijing have complained for more than three years about the nearby Gaoantun landfill and waste incineration facility. </p> <p>Every day, 3,700 tonnes of household refuse are buried in the 40-hectare landfill. In addition, the plant burns 40 tonnes of medical waste from hospitals, raising fears among locals that the air is being polluted by odourless carcinogenic dioxins. This is denied by the plant's owners. </p> <p>Residents have petitioned the authorities and filed a lawsuit in the courts. Dissatisfied with the lack of progress, they are using the internet, text messages and demonstrations to be heard. </p> <p>Zhen Qianling, a chemist among the crowd, said the stink from the plant on hot days made him feel sick and sent his heart racing. 'We want to block the traffic so the government will hear our voice. If we just sit back and do nothing, the government will also do nothing.' Like many, this was the first protest he had joined. The demonstrators were young urban professionals - designers, internet workers and translators. Other protestors were from the 'New Sky Universe' and 'Berlin Symphony' tower blocks. Property costs about 14,000 yuan (\u00a31,100) a square metre, well above the Beijing average. The residents thought they were buying into one of the city's most salubrious neighbourhoods, but on hot summer days, when the wind is in the wrong direction, their homes are filled with the stench from the dump. </p> <p>'If I had known, I would never have bought a home here,' says Helen Liu, a translator who moved into her 500,000 yuan house in April.</p> <p>In the run-up to the Olympics, police detained several prominent dissidents and put others under close surveillance. Three 'protest parks' were established, but of the 77 people who applied to use them, none have yet succeeded. According to human rights groups, several applicants were sent back to their home provinces or put in 're-education through labour' camps. Foreigners who staged Free Tibet demonstrations have been deported. </p> <p>The residents of Chanying said they did not fear a police backlash because China was becoming more open and the authorities' concerns about losing face during the Games have diminished. </p> <p>During the demonstration and after police warned the protesters they were breaking the law, they became almost comically well-mannered. They walked slowly back and forth for more than an hour across a pedestrian crossing - but only on the green man - chanting, 'We don't want stinking air.' </p> <p>Managers at the site said emissions met environment bureau standards, but officials acknowledged the smell was a problem. 'We pay a lot of attention to the residents' concerns,' said Guo Tuanhui. 'On hot days, the buried rubbish gives off a bad odour. But we are doing what we can.'</p> <p>The rally appeared to be part of a growing trend in China, as well-educated, middle-class citizens complain about environmental hazards. </p> <p>In May 2007, thousands took to the streets of Xiamen in Fujian province, forcing the local government to halt plans for a chemical factory. </p> <p>Last year, the head of China's environmental agency, Zhou Shengxian, blamed the rising number of riots, demonstrations and petitions across the country on public anger at pollution. </p> <p>The public have good reason to be concerned. According to the World Bank, up to 400,000 people in China die each year from outdoor air pollution, 30,000 from indoor air pollution, and 60,000 from water pollution.</p>",
  "<p>Given the genocidal record of Belgium's King Leopold II in the Congo towards the end of the 19th century, the choice of Emmanuel de Merode - a descendant of Belgian royalty - as director of Africa's oldest national park might raise some eyebrows. But as crisis threatens to overwhelm Virunga National Park, which lies at the epicentre of a war zone, it is Merode's credentials that count rather than past colonial misdeeds.</p> <p>London-born Merode, a former head of the conservation group Wildlife Direct, is now responsible for the Democratic Republic of Congo's endangered mountain gorilla population, whose plight came to the world's attention last year when photographs of four bullet-ridden carcasses were published. The appointment follows a year which has seen rebel general Laurent Nkunda's army take over the park, swamping it with an estimated 16,000 armed militia.</p> <p>Last week saw the heaviest fighting between the rebels and government forces for a year, and at the centre of the fighting was the Virunga. A growing demand for bushmeat and other illegal products has led to massive and sustained attacks on the park's wildlife. The hippo population of Lake Edward, once the greatest in the world, has been nearly wiped out. The greatest reserve in Africa, with more mammal, bird and reptile species than any other ecosystem, is in grave peril.</p> <p>With financial help from the European Union, Merode hopes to re-establish the rule of law, save what remains of the wildlife and secure the park on a basis of stability and economic growth. It is, to put it mildly, a dangerous mission. A number of his predecessors have lost their lives. Caught up in Africa's bloodiest civil war and deadly fighting between gorilla poachers and illegal charcoal traders, the aristocratic director must manage 680 park rangers. There were once 800, but 120 trackers and guides have been slaughtered in the past decade. </p> <p>'I know this is a tough job,' Merode told The Observer 'You only have to look at the intensity of the conflict in and around the park to understand this is a daunting challenge, but it is a great privilege to be working alongside such a dedicated and courageous team of rangers.'</p> <p>The fate of the gorillas, believed to number around 190 of the world's remaining 700, is causing growing concern. Last year was the bloodiest on record, as 10 gorillas were shot and killed and two others went missing. The rangers don't know for certain the motive of the 'executions', but believe that charcoal traders are to blame. The great apes may have the potential to draw tourist revenue to a desperately poor region and bring in vital funding through conservation groups, but their environment is being destroyed around them. </p> <p>'Nobody knows what's happening to the gorillas up there,' says Felician, a local tracker. 'The few who go in can't find them in the upper slopes any more. We hear and sometimes see the fighting; we don't know if the gorillas are in the middle or in the outer edges.'</p> <p>'Despite the fighting, we are as determined as ever to get back in,' Merode said, adding that mortar and grenade explosions had been booming around the park for days. 'It is critical that we know the status of the mountain gorillas. The more cut off we are from them, the less chance we have of securing their survival.</p> <p>'The Democratic Republic of Congo is emerging from one of the most traumatic wars since the Second World War. All of its institutions, including the judicial system, are very frail, very fragile. Millions of innocent civilians have died. What has happened to the gorillas is a terrible tragedy, but it is in the context of something that's even worse. </p> <p>'What has driven the war in eastern Congo is the pillaging of natural resources. And be it the forests, be it the minerals, it's the richest country in the world with the poorest people. We're losing one of the world's greatest gems in terms of natural resources, in terms of human heritage and in terms of global heritage.'</p>",
  "<p>Keith Richards used to live at number 3, George Eliot died at number 4 and Dante Gabriel Rossetti was banned from keeping peacocks at number 16. Chelsea's Cheyne Walk is one of the most historic streets in London, its snaking row of Georgian and Victorian town houses fronting the Thames like soldiers puffing out their chests on medal day. It's a desirable address. 'Bryan Adams owns most of the properties in this block,' drawls fashion designer Daniella Helayel, as she climbs the final flight of stairs to the TV room at the top of her four-storey mansion. 'He's wiping out three of them to make a big studio for his photography.' Now on the balcony she waves towards the water where a row of boats dip up and down with the tide. 'Damien Hirst has a houseboat over there.'</p> <p>Helayel moved to England from Brazil, via New York, in 2000 and a year later started her label Issa, which means 'lucky' in surfer slang in Brazil - surfers scream it when they catch the biggest wave. It's an auspicious name that has certainly delivered. Helayel's easy-to-wear, elegant dresses scored her a clutch of fashion headlines this summer after she supplied Kate Middleton with a holiday wardrobe; Scarlett Johansson, Kylie and Keira Knightley have all been seen in her creations, as has Madonna, whom Helayel met through Kabbalah, though the designer hasn't been to a meeting for a long time.</p> <p>A sense of history is important to Helayel. Descending a flight of stairs and entering the bedroom, she begins to talk heritage, recounting the back stories of her five London homes (she's rented them all, including this one, which she's lived in for the past three years) and describes enthusiastically how this house was built by a 19th-century coal magnate. She also reveals how her landlady won't sell it to her. 'But,' laughs the designer, as her live-in housekeeper sets a tea-tray on the fabric-draped bed, 'I can decorate it how I choose and take most of the things with me when I move.' </p> <p>So, with the help of her friend, the Brazilian artist Olivier Mourao, she has stripped walls and covered them with textiles, hung colour-drenched paintings, installed Jack and the Beanstalk-sized columns and adorned rooms with vintage wooden furniture, creating a rich, warm, womb-like environment in a palette of deep browns and reds. Helayel's chairs, beds and tables are mostly Indian and Moroccan in style, bought from antique shops on the King's Road and in Notting Hill. She doesn't think contemporary styles suit historic London homes. 'I like the work of Zaha Hadid and Marc Newson, but I couldn't see pieces like that fitting into where I live,' she explains. 'Besides I am bohemian and relaxed, and so is this place.' </p> <p>Despite the building's size (four bedrooms, five bathrooms, two reception rooms and a dining room) the decor is at once soothing and playful - an ideal place to entertain her many friends; she has installed a huge tent-like bed in her second-floor reception room where they can hang out, and once had a party for 200 people. But when Helayel needs space to herself she escapes to the top room, or to the foot of the stairs outside the ground-floor kitchen, like a supper-hungry child.</p> <p>Finishing her tea, Helayel prepares to pose for photos in her 'Lucky' dress, her latest hit design based on an outfit she wore as a baby. She gestures towards the dressing table smothered in framed photographs of family, friends and Babi the Maltese dog, who she left with her grandmother in Brazil (Helayel has two other Malteses called Monster and Snowball living with her here). Then she explains how English houses should be interior-designed. 'They should be cosy,' she says, 'because most of the time it is grey and wintry and when you get in you need to feel totally welcomed and hugged.' </p> <p>Helayel picks up a photo of her mother and it becomes suddenly, painfully clear why she needs her home to be familial, comforting. 'My mother was very stylish,' she says, brushing the glass with her fingertips. She affectionately calls to the housekeeper to remove the tray and adds: 'But she died already.'

  "<p>They are hallowed hallways by any measure, those of the Philharmonie in Berlin. Home to what most critics would acknowledge to be the greatest orchestra in the world, it stands off Potsdamer Platz, across which the wall that divided Europe once cut. There is so much charismatic history both of music and of politics here - a battleground and fulcrum of the 20th century.</p> <p>So there is something both strange and refreshing about the face and figure at the apex of the Philarmonie's solemn edifice, the present carrier of the traditions of the mighty Berlin Philharmonic. It is Simon Rattle, a man one thinks one knows, not just because he is British, and not only because of countless evenings watching him conduct and the immersion in the sound his conducting inspires, but also because of all those cliches attached to him. Like his mop of curly hair (irrelevant) or the baffling but habitual likening of Rattle to Tony Blair - because he is said somehow to 'spin' music (downright offensive). Mr Nice-Guy, 'Our Simon', the man who made it to the top job in music.</p> <p>In the event, apart from his musical mastery, what is so compelling about the man who, to my mind, has made a greater impact on the arts worldwide than any other living Brit, is none of these things. The exact opposite in fact: it is the passion and intensity - severity almost - with which he discusses what he believes, loves and disapproves of, be it with regard to Berlin, music, children, children and music, The Sopranos, Cuban jazz, football, or the city in which he was born, and to which, after a couple of London Proms on Tuesday and Wednesday, he travels to give the first of two historic concerts: Liverpool.</p> <p>In Liverpool, Rattle needs no introduction. He is a local hero whose return to this singular place has a resonance akin to a homecoming performance by Michael Owen or Paul McCartney, only a more convincing and cogent one nowadays than either of those could muster. Rattle is one of the highlights of the city's stint as European Capital of Culture.</p> <p>On Thursday, the 53-year-old Scouser comes home to the Philharmonic Hall between the cathedrals - the Anglican colossus and 'Paddy's Wigwam' - on Hope Street, with his Berlin Philharmonic, to play a concert of music by Wagner and Messiaen. And a month later, on 2 October, there is an even more emotionally charged event: Rattle will conduct the orchestra to which he listened as a child and conducted at the age of 20, the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic, playing the same symphony he conducted that evening back in 1975, Sibelius's fifth. </p> <p>'Talk about a home match,' he enthuses in his room at the Berlin Philharmonie. 'If you are sentimental, as I am in buckets, it's going to be quite a moment. With the Berliners, it will be amazing but, in a weird way, even more with the Liverpool Phil. One of the things I decided to do was to conduct the very first piece I ever conducted with them, which I might have conducted more than any other symphony during the years in between. It will be a very, very special moment.'</p> <p>Liverpudlians harbour notoriously powerful feelings about where they are from, a city which turns its back on England, an Atlantic city looking seawards. Rattle is no exception and an agreeable undertow cuts beneath our conversation because Liverpool is also my mother's [children's author Shirley Hughes] home town. Rattle knows her books and her father's department store, TJ Hughes (still there and making a fortune for others) on London Road at the entrance to Everton Brow. 'Of course Liverpool looks seawards,' says Rattle. 'They call themselves smoked Irish, don't they? Liverpool is off the side of the known universe and it always was.</p> <p>'New York is the only other place comparable. You don't like Liverpool: you either loathe it or you love it. And I don't know anyone who loathes it and comes from it. You don't have [and Rattle uses a German word meaning 'middle' or 'medium'] mittel-message feelings about Liverpool. The minute I get off the train and hear the accent, I'm sold. One \"arright?\" and I'm home. And it's nice to see it in such a renaissance because there were some really rough times in Liverpool, after the riots, the Derek Hatton years.' </p> <p>He says this with solemn slowness, as though a dear friend had been abused by the years when Hatton and Margaret Thatcher picked over Liverpool's bones.</p> <p>'And it was a depressing place. Now it's alive, it has cleaned itself up wonderfully, but it's always going to be itself.'</p> <p>The conversation moves to Rattle's childhood and first experiences with music, though there is a painful poignancy in the timing: his mother Pauline died four weeks ago and so the planned reunion with her son and all her grandchildren at Philharmonic Hall, just short of her 90th birthday, will not happen.</p> <p>Rattle was born in January 1955 in what he calls 'the Jewish, liberal-voting suburbs around Sefton Park where my ... I keep saying where my mother still lives. I mean, where my sister still lives'. But to hear him, you'd think he had grown up in the Philharmonic Hall, listening to the orchestra he will conduct in October, and which was the gateway to those 18 years as conductor of the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, then on to Berlin. 'It's the orchestra from which I learnt what music sounded like, at a time when the programming was the most adventurous in Europe. I went to every possible thing I could and that meant seeing Charles Groves [the LPO's music director] who believed in playing everything. I heard the old, I heard the new. If a wonderful new piece arrived like, for instance - 1970 I think it was - Birtwistle's Triumph of Time, Charlie heard about it and that would be the beginning for the next season.'</p> <p>Groves conducted a complete Mahler cycle with the same orchestra, which was, enthuses Rattle, 'the first time that had been done in Europe, believe it or not. It had only been done in Utah by Maurice Abravanel. The Mahler was extraordinary. Many of us were teenagers at the time, we wouldn't miss them, and I can still remember the impact. The second symphony changed my life enough to make me a conductor. George Hurst conducted that. I can remember hearing the third symphony; there was an interval after the first movement, friends looking at each other, completely overwhelmed by the impact of the music.'</p> <p>Rattle's Tuesday Prom and the Berliners' programme in Liverpool culminate with Messiaen's Turangalila Symphony - like the Sibelius, by autobiographical design. 'When I was perhaps 10 or 11 the Turangalila was a very rare thing, but of course it did happen in Liverpool. But there was a bus strike. My parents never let me go to concerts in the week because it was school time and I had to badger and badger them. I'd slipped into the rehearsals at the weekend, which I did a lot - the 86 bus and I were bosom pals - and said, \"I have to hear this piece.\" And so, aged 11, I managed to persuade my father to take me. I met Messiaen and got the autograph - I still think it was one of the most thrilling moments of my life. I thought I was going to jump out of my seat. So it is extraordinary to be going back to Liverpool to play Turangalila on what would have been Messiaen's 100th anniversary, really emotional.'</p> <p>So who was this child who 'badgered' his parents into taking him to hear Messiaen? 'An uncomfortable, overweight, intense boy with this huge passion,' replies Rattle. 'And the minute I started playing in the Merseyside Youth Orchestra when I was 10, from that moment I felt much more comfortable with myself because there were other people dealing with the same kind of enthusiasms and obsessions. Yes, I was a weird duck, no doubt. But it's very funny talking to the people in Berlin, amazing how many of them would describe themselves as the strangest person in their class. People are astonishingly honest here, and that's not a German thing, it's a northern thing. For a Scouser, it's great to be in Berlin because people are very straight - you know exactly where you are with them, and they tend to tell you things like that.'</p> <p>My eldest daughter's first orchestral concert was a performance of Mahler's eighth symphony, on her eighth birthday, played by the European Union Youth Orchestra under Rattle's baton. And for all my fears that she would probably want to leave after eight minutes, she heard it out on the edge of her seat, and recalls it all, and him, vividly. Rattle and I talk about this - 'Would I subject my eight-year-old to that?' he wonders. 'Probably not!' - but only by way of introducing a theme about which Rattle feels as deeply as anything else: children and music. </p> <p>As reported in this newspaper recently, a battle rages over music in British schools between people such as Rattle, Julian Lloyd Webber and Peter Maxwell Davies, who believe that deprived children have a right of access to great classical music, and those - with their bastion in the north west, as it happens - who believe that music education should consist of what is regarded as 'relevant' to children and chosen by them, not 'bourgeois' and 'imposed' from the classical heritage. It's a situation which results in poor children studying rap music in class and never hearing a note of Beethoven.</p> <p>This stands in diametric opposition to an initiative in Venezuela energetically promoted in Europe by Rattle called El Sistema, whereby the poorest barrio children in shanties beleaguered by gang warfare and drugs are organised into orchestras to play classical music. It was the brainchild, 30 years ago, of an extraordinary man and inspiration to Rattle, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Abreu, who once told me, unforgettably: 'The rich owe the poor a debt which they will never pay materially. But they can repay it culturally, so that to deprive the poor of great, high art is a terrible form of oppression.'</p> <p>Rattle's championing of Abreu, and his protege, conductor Gustavo Dudamel, led to the appointment, at age 18, of the Berlin Philharmonic's youngest-ever recruit, double bass player Edicson Ruiz, who came up through El Sistema, and who told Rattle: 'When I was nine, I didn't know I would get a meal at night or every day, but I did have a viola.'</p> <p>'The point is,' says Rattle, 'that this has saved countless lives - there are now close to half a million children involved. We have got to get Abreu the Nobel Prize,' he says, more intense about this than anything else during our conversation. 'Is there anyone who deserves it more?'</p> <p>But the obvious question remains: why do the poorest children in the poorest countries in the world get Beethoven while those in England get Jay-Z? 'Maybe this could only happen in a culture where they have so little,' says Rattle. 'I've heard that they have been studying El Sistema, and there is a Scottish pilot plan going on, and I cannot tell you how well I wish them, but I have the feeling that a culture that has so much and so many other distractions and so many more material things will not have the same chance of success. As the [Venezuelan] kids said to the audience here: \"This is not an important part of our lives, this is our lives.\"'</p> <p>When Rattle took over the Berlin Philharmonic, he made it a stipulation that the orchestra would engage in 'outreach' projects involving deprived children and poor neighbourhoods in the city. But he is harsh with himself about the potency of such projects and the outreach work by British orchestras on which they are modelled: 'We do what we can here. And we have touched the lives of a lot of people. But I am very aware that we are just throwing them very occasional vitamins, whereas someone like Abreu has rescued a whole society. The society there is so fragmented that it has almost a kind of cohesion. It's as though the music was able to flow through all those gaps and pull it together. I think that here - maybe I'm wrong - I can't see it getting beyond the first barriers and I can't, frankly, see the political will.'</p> <p>Rattle famously spent 18 years from 1980 with the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, lifting it from British music's Championship to the Premier League, though not the European Champions League, playing in Britain's most acoustically perfect performance hall. His loyalty to the orchestra and city was a shining example of dedication and won him many accolades. </p> <p>It also won him election by the Berlin Philharmonic under the democracy whereby its musicians appoint their leaders. He was elected on a specific manifesto to expand the orchestra's repertoire and sound textures. Since that time, the same article about Rattle has been written a thousand times in Germany and Britain. </p> <p>It debates (and I summarise) the notion that Rattle's programming, which entwines the core of Austro-German romantic music, which the Berliners play with unrivalled intensity and mastery, with different shades and timbres from other countries, epochs and traditions, might in some way squander the glorious 'inner glow' for which the orchestra and its Germanic heritage and unrivalled sound are revered. Does Rattle dilute the great traditions established by his awesome ancestry at the Berlin Philharmonic: Claudio Abbado, Herbert von Karajan, Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler? </p> <p>Different writers reach different conclusions but it should be remembered that the great Abbado was also criticised for not being as great as the greater Karajan, and the greater Karajan took flak for not being as great as the superlatively greater Furtw\u00e4ngler, as though the destiny of the world's most magnificent orchestra operated to a law of diminishing returns.</p> <p>This over-trodden discourse has made a man called Axel Br\u00fcggemann one of the most quoted music critics in the world for writing in Die Welt that under Rattle, 'the Philharmonic's musicians sometimes play as inconsequentially as if they were a wife reaching into the fridge for a beer for her husband' (he later leapt to his own defence in the Frankfurter Allgemeine, under a pseudonym). </p> <p>Well, the mighty Berlin Philharmonic will deliver its own reply on the matter of whether it should also play non-German music by playing Messiaen, Shostakovich and Sibelius in London and Liverpool. And Rattle's retort is this: 'It is astonishing that there are people who think that they shouldn't. It's staggering. Intelligent British music critics, who would consider themselves forward-looking.</p> <p>'Yes, there are certain areas of the repertoire for which this orchestra was designed: you play Bruckner, Wagner, Brahms with them, there's just no argument, and part of my job is to make sure that that body still remains. But it's also to give it a different type of feather, other colours. Like Messiaen: Turangalila is not only a great song of joy and release after the Second World War, but deeply to do with Tristan and Isolde and that myth and, in a way, enormously Wagnerian.'</p> <p>So now we are free to move on to other things, such as the self-evident but often overlooked fact that the world's greatest conductors harbour other passions beyond music. Many people were surprised that Simon Rattle took a year 'out' to study English literature at St Anne's College, Oxford in 1980/1. But why should they have been? 'I was of that generation, the last generation, where if people did well, they skipped classes, they moved forward a year,' says Rattle. 'That happened to me twice, so I finished my A-levels when I was 16 and wanted to go to university but they wouldn't have me at 16, completely correctly. So I went to the Royal Academy of Music, thank God. </p> <p>'In my mid-twenties, I was with a conducting career, but I had never been to university and I wanted to. There were things I wanted to study in depth. I also wanted to see if I could survive without music. There were tremendous hunger pangs, but it was interesting how anything else of the same specific gravity could fill that. It was wonderful for me to know that I could be just as moved and uplifted by Andrew Marvell or Ulysses as I could be by music. And, of course, when I came back to the music there was a quality and an intensity that you get when a painting is well restored.'</p> <p>Books did not vanish from the shelves when Rattle returned to music. 'Right at the moment, I'm reading this extraordinary newish translation of Don Quixote and it is more than a delight. It suddenly struck me: it is the same kind of time as Monteverdi - they were more or less contemporaries. Monteverdi is inventing opera and Cervantes invents the novel. It's there, complete: everything you would ever need in a novel, particularly the irony of the tone which wasn't going to be seen again until the 19th century.' </p> <p>One slightly dreads asking Rattle about his romantic life because the question is as predictable as it is unwelcome to a man of his, well, amorous nature. He was first married to the American soprano Elise Ross, with whom he had two sons (one of whom, Sacha, is a clarinettist), then to the screenwriter and political activist Candace Allen, but fell madly in love with the famous Czech mezzo-soprano Magdalena Kozena, with whom he has two young sons, Jonas and Milos. At home he says: 'The jazz records come out a lot. You find that with many musicians - we don't listen to our own music for relaxation. It was Sarah Vaughan on last night, Magdalena and I saying, \"Was there ever a better singer?\" It's funny - if you were to name the 10 greatest jazz singers, would you necessarily name Sarah Vaughan? I'm not sure I would, but you listen to i t...</p> <p>'Then there are endless mambos, Venezuelan music [to which Jonas and Milos love to dance] and Gonzalo Rubalcaba, who is the most gifted pianist on the planet and a wonderful man.' One wonders how Rattle's opposite number at the Deutsche Staatsoper down the road, the inimitable Daniel Barenboim, would react to that remark.</p> <p>During my six years living in New York, some of the most precious evenings were those spent ensuring I got to hear the Cuban Rubalcaba whenever he played, with his astonishing, lyrical intensity, and off we go. 'I love him even more now,' says Rattle. 'I loved his early stuff when he played faster than anybody who has ever been born, but he uses that very sparingly now - he can be very still.'</p> <p>Does he mind having this conversation rather than one about whether his orchestra should or should not play Shostakovich? 'This is important,' he says. </p> <p>So what about films? 'With two small children, films are a real treat, because you have to decide,' he replies. 'What I did was to install a full cinema screen in our house. But I am living with someone from the Czech Republic, who was not able to see a lot of the things that she should have seen. She hadn't seen 2001. She's seen every film by Eisenstein, as you can imagine, but there are many things she hasn't - Kubrick, Werner Herzog, all those things. We catch up with films late, but we got completely hooked on The Sopranos and watched that from beginning to end, the most astonishing single piece of narrative television I've ever seen. Perfect for parents of young children - 52 minutes you can watch, a film you can't.'</p> <p>Rattle suits this city: transformed as it is, funky, cultured and breezily intelligent; capital not only of a changing, emergent country both young and old, but the heart of the new, unified European continent that Britain refuses to partake in. He has been out of the UK for six years now and made Berlin home for four of them. Now Rattle views the island of Britannia, this hubristic isolation and thereby his own identity, differently.</p> <p>'We're in Europe, it's just that no one has realised. I think Europe is a real ideal, but then I would think that - it's easy for someone who travels around that much. We are part of Europe, there is no escape from it. But even in Iceland, I think they feel more in Europe than we do. We are in it whether we like it nor not, and eventually that'll get through into the political discourse, which is not very impressive at the moment. </p> <p>'And my God, Europe needs itself, we need each other more and more in this strange, fragmented world. We had better learn. Having said that, I do feel deracinated. Some political things that seemed desperately important in England seem, shall we say, less significant now. Obama versus McCain is much more important for the world than anything that might be going on in the Labour party right now.'</p> <p>The final difficult question to ask any Scouser is whether they are red nosed or blue nosed, Liverpool or Everton, because they know the answer will alienate half the city. Luckily, Rattle saves me the embarrassment, simply continuing the conversation we are having about his 'deracination'. 'There was a friendly match between the Berlin team and Liverpool, my team, a few weeks ago and I went with my two older sons - and they went crazy. They said, \"Dad, you're cheering both sides!\" But these are my two cities. And this is also possible. I'm deracinated enough to cheer for the Germans as well as the Scousers.'</p> <p>So: from Liverpool to Berlin, to raise a cheer for both, before bringing the Berlin Philharmonic back to Liverpool and then conducting Merseyside's local band. But there are even more pressing engagements: 'If I didn't have to meet the children at the playground,' says Rattle, 'so that Magdalena can do Pilates, we'd have longer to talk.'</p> <h2>Fast Movement<br>A life in music</h2> <p><strong>1955</strong><br>Born Simon Denis Rattle in Liverpool. His parents, Pauline and Denis, encouraged his early talent: at four he had a drumkit; by 11 he was playing percussion and piano, then conducting for Merseyside Youth Orchestra.</p> <p><strong>1971</strong><br>Rattle attended the Royal Academy of Music in London. Shortly before joining he played once with the National Youth Orchestra under Ivey Dickson (pictured), managing to arrange a lesson with Pierre Boulez in the process.</p> <p><strong>1974</strong><br>Rattle won the John Player International Conductors' Competition and was awarded the post of assistant conductor of the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra. Impressive reviews followed.</p> <p><strong>1980</strong><br>Aged 24, Rattle was appointed principal conductor of the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra. During his 18 years there he turned the orchestra's fortunes round and became a household name himself. He was knighted in 1994. </p> <p><strong>2002 </strong><br>Rattle became the artistic director of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. Despite a brief mauling in the German press, in 2008 the orchestra's musicians voted for Rattle to remain in his post until 2020. <br><strong>Imogen Carter</strong></p> <h2>From the archive<br>The Observer, 29 June 1975</h2> <p><strong>Stephen Walsh, then the deputy classical critic, reviews the young Simon Rattle</strong></p> <p>Tuesday's concert in St John's, Smith Square, by the Salomon Orchestra featured a gifted young conductor, Simon Rattle, in performances of Haydn's 95th Symphony, the Adagio of Mahler's 10th and Strauss's Don Quixote. The Salomon, one of the best of amateur orchestras, has a good record in bringing forward young conductors. I doubt, though, whether even they have gone much nearer the cradle than Mr Rattle who, already a winner of the Bournemouth Conductors' Competition, is barely 21.</p> <p>Mature conductors of that age are rare, and even Mr Rattle wasn't quite equal to the basic difficulty of securing deft and athletic playing from amateur players in a Haydn symphony which many of them obviously regarded as a warming up exercise for the technical exertions of the other works.</p> <p>Easily the best performance was of Mahler's beautiful 25-minute Adagio. Mr Rattle, who has experience of Mahler, showed remarkable ability to sustain long melodic sentences and build them into coherent paragraphs. The searing climax, with the wind sections in superb form, was by any standards exciting. But the whole movement was intelligently and sensitively shaped, and commendably well played.</p> <p>Don Quixote, also difficult but in different ways, interspersed playing of great vitality (including from the cello soloist, Moray Welsh) with a certain untidiness. There was some over-playing. But the conductor again showed mature control, and a lively grasp of musical portraiture and narrative.</p> <h2>Young Simon<br>A teacher recalls</h2> <p><strong>Geoff Cowie</strong><br><strong>Now chairman of Liverpool Philharmonic Youth Orchestra (formerly Merseyside Youth Orchestra) </strong></p> <p>I met Simon the very first day he came to join Merseyside Youth Orchestra (MYO). He was 11 or 12, and I was the deputy conductor. I've been involved with the MYO for 57 years and I've seen countless youngsters coming in and occasionally one comes in and you think 'yes, this one's different'. Simon was the first person I really recognised as having that special something.</p> <p>He was just a little lad, and he was younger than the minimum age to join. I don't think Simon actually auditioned but the then conductor Bill Jenkins, who founded the orchestra, he made the rules and bent the rules! Back then he played timps and percussion. He wasn't virtuosic: the musicality didn't show out as much as it would when he started conducting with us. But I enjoyed conducting him on a number of occasions. Once we did a version of Eric Coates's 'The Three Bears' suite, which has a narrator, and his father did the narration.</p> <p>My most enduring memory of Simon is of a trip the orchestra took in 1972 to Lausanne in Switzerland for an international competition. Simon decided he wanted to gather a group of his peers together and conduct them. I can't remember the piece but he pulled together quite a large number of people, from orchestras from all over the world - Japan, Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, South Africa. I was incredibly impressed that he had the motivation and the guts to say 'will you come and play for me' - and dozens of them did.</p> <p>I've only seen him a couple of times since he took the job at Bournemouth in 1974. A few years back he brought his new partner and baby to Liverpool to see the Philharmonic Hall. It was a Sunday morning and I was with the youth orchestra rehearsing. Simon cried out 'Geoff' in greeting and I shouted 'Simon' and the youth orchestra were all open-mouthed in awe, because he's their hero. <br><strong>Interview by Imogen Carter</strong></p>",
  "<p>In an illuminating column, my colleague Heather Stewart recently noted that it's not just house prices and growth rates that have tumbled down in the credit crunch. It's the whole easy assumption that the market knows best. </p> <p>For three decades a single dominant thought has crowded out all others: that managing, whether of economies or organisations, is a matter of switching on the automatic pilot of the market's invisible hand and letting rational selfishly motivated individuals do the rest. NHS, railways, pay, investment, economic structure ... there was no problem for which the free play of the market would not provide the answer.</p> <p>But the dominant idea is now under attack. One prong of the offensive is the course of events; after all, it wasn't supposed to be like this. Over the past decade, rather than a stimulating pat on the back, the invisible hand has administered a succession of increasingly damaging haymakers: South East Asia, hedge fund LTCM, the dotcoms, Enron and other corporate scandals, now the sub-prime shambles. After several knockdowns, the unfettered market has put the global economy on the canvas for the count.</p> <p>Despite the efforts of the cheerleaders, only a tiny minority actually benefited from the era of rampant financial capitalism inaugurated by Wall Street and the City and, as polls consistently show, few in either the US or UK have any trust in its institutions or officers. They are right to be suspicious. But, as Stewart also noted, just as the practice of financial capitalism is being questioned, so are its intellectual underpinnings. As it excavates the foundations, the burgeoning school of behavioural economics is shouldering aside the desiccated calculations of economic man to make legitimate space for emotion, altruism and fair play in economic behaviour.</p> <p>The final element in the attack on orthodoxy comes in the shape of what we have learnt about management over 25 years. From the performance of exceptional outliers in a surprising number of industries - John Lewis and Whole Foods Market, WL Gore, Nucor, Southwest Airlines, Semco, Toyota - we know that good work can thrive in a variety of ownership and incentive structures. </p> <p>It has nothing necessarily to do with stock options, private ownership or extravagantly paid senior executives. It does have to do with effective work organisation and systems, which the individual performance management regimes favoured by the private sector are as likely to destroy as to support.</p> <p>It is now apparent that where the private sector does excel is in disguising the full costs of its incentives by externalising their dysfunctional results on to society as a whole. Today's credit crunch is the most stunning example of this perverse behaviour in economic history.</p> <p>Of course there's no hiding that much public service is depressingly bad, but again this has nothing to do with public or private; customer service in the private sector is equally poor. This is not surprising because, ironically, the badness in both cases could be said to be another market externality - the purchase of identical IT-based mass-production service systems geared to meeting the internal incentives of the management consultancies that sell them rather than the needs of the end customer. Intrinsically, there is no reason why public-sector organisations cannot provide service at least as good as the best private sector outfits - and a growing number of them do.</p> <p>The discovery that, pace private equity, work organisation is just as important for performance as agency theory or ownership liberates - or should - all kinds of new thinking about how services could be organised and delivered. It's not the market that will provide the answer to poor public (or indeed private) service: it is, as it always was, the hard work of establishing what the customer wants and organising the work to meet it with minimum fuss, and therefore least cost. </p> <p>No one would want to return to some of the methods of the nationalised industries of the past - although it now appears that their performance may not have been as bad as it seemed at the time. But as we have seen, the public sector has no natural monopoly of management badness any more than the private sector of good. </p> <p>The late JK Galbraith once noted that the left needed to be smarter about management than the right, since it insisted on taking under its control industries which the private sector had given up as basket cases. The conclusion still applies, but for the opposite reason. Ironically, if it is tragically the case that after all the frantic activity of the past 11 years, public services are still as much in need of reform as ever they were, it's because of New Labour's simplistic reliance on the invisible hand. Management of the market is more important than management by it.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:simon.caulkin@observer.co.uk\">simon.caulkin@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

  "<p>The Republican war room in Denver looked harmless. It was on a busy road in a neighbourhood of modest motels and petrol stations. Only a handmade sign, emblazoned with an arrow and the words 'John McCain', pointed the way.</p> <p>But looks can be deceiving. More than two dozen Republican staffers were camped in Denver last week, spearheading the latest assaults on Barack Obama who was addressing the Democratic convention nearby. 'We came here to piss the Democrats off,' said one Republican aide with a grin.</p> <p>They have largely succeeded. Each day new adverts have hammered a relentless drumbeat of negativity, painting Obama as too liberal, too inexperienced and practically a danger to America's future. Leading lights of the Republican universe have paraded in front of the cameras in a disciplined display of party message-making. A typical performance came from former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani. 'There are still a lot of serious questions about Barack Obama's preparedness to lead the country,' Giuliani said, before stepping aside to showcase the latest ad on a huge flat-screen TV.</p> <p>The ad attacked Obama as being so ignorant of foreign affairs that he was virtually a security threat himself. It touched on scare issues such as Islamic terrorism and Iranian nukes. Then it represented Obama's positions on national security as naive and weak. 'These are contrast ads,' Giuliani said afterwards. 'And both sides do them.'</p> <p>That is only half-true. Democrats do launch attack ads and campaign negatively but no one does it like the Republican party. Under a succession of dark geniuses, the party has perfected the black art of negative campaigning. It has created the most effective attack machine in the Western world, with the sole purpose of destroying opponents and winning elections. For opponents it is a source of shock, misery and more than a little envy. Its tentacles stretch from the McCain campaign into the murky corners of talk radio, the internet and shadowy groups willing to use any outlandish smear. </p> <p>Now that machine is focused with laser-like intensity on Obama. The clamour is loud and shrill: Obama is vain, inexperienced, liberal and dangerous. It is backed by a clandestine chorus whispering that he has a secretive Islamic past and it uses racially loaded language. It is also only going to get louder. This week, as McCain and the Republicans gather for their party convention in the Minnesota city of St Paul, the noise will become deafening. It has one purpose - to keep the White House in Republican hands at all costs and against the odds.</p> <p>The current mastermind of the Republican attack machine is known as the Bullet. He is Steve Schmidt, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Bush's guru, Karl Rove. Nicknamed for his results as much as his bald head, he made his name as commander of the war room that wiped out Democrat John Kerry in 2004. Brought in to shake things up in July, Schmidt imposed discipline on a disorganised campaign. He dissuaded McCain from his off-the-cuff chats with reporters, and honed the focus solely on making Obama unelectable.</p> <p>Schmidt works on the principles of repeating simple messages loudly and often. Ads attack Obama as a 'celebrity' or a faux-messiah. By doing so they hope to turn Obama's greatest strength - his ability to inspire - into a fatal flaw. That is backed up by another line: that Obama is simply not fit to be president. NotReady08 is the name of a website set up by the campaign. The language can be harsh. 'We are in the hunt for the White House. Barack Obama is going to have to step up with more than a smart tongue, snappy words and a nice suit,' said Maryland Republican politician Michael Steele. </p> <p>The campaign will happily twist words. In the ad that Giuliani showed, Obama was hit for referring to the 'tiny' threat from a nuclear Iran. In reality Obama had been pointing out that the problem of Iran was '... tiny compared to the Soviet Union'. Others have interspersed footage of the Democrat candidate with images of Britney Spears. One jokey advert painted him as a Moses-type figure capable of parting the Red Sea. Mocking his message of 'hope' and 'change', radio host Rush Limbaugh has taken to referring on-air to Obama as simply 'the Messiah'.</p> <p>The attack dogs will eagerly embrace formerly hated targets. All last week Republicans lauded the achievements and brilliance of Hillary Clinton, seeking to exploit divisions in the Democratic Party. It has rounded up former Clinton supporters who now back McCain and paraded them like captured prisoners of war. '[McCain] really does admire and respect her and honours the campaign that she ran,' said Carly Fiorina, a top McCain adviser. Those are astonishing words from a senior figure in a party which spent two decades demonising Clinton as a left-wing uber-feminist. But that is the key to the success of the Republican attack machine: the past does not exist. What matters is what works now. Democrats know more of the same is coming. 'This is going to be the most vicious campaign we have ever faced,' said Terry McAuliffe, Clinton's former campaign chairman. </p> <p>Schmidt and his public operations are merely the visible tip of the machine. But the most aggressive ads are not made by the McCain campaign. They are made by so-called '527 groups' - named for a clause in the tax laws - that cannot officially be linked to any campaign. They are privately financed and exist outside the campaigns, like some sort of 'black ops' off the CIA budget. Democrats have been helped by 527 groups too, though Obama has tried to clamp down on their activities. But Republicans have found them to be highly effective. The Swift Boat campaign that raised questions about Kerry's Vietnam service in the 2004 campaign was a 527. It was financed largely by Texan billionaire Harold Simmons. Simmons has now donated \u00a31.5m to a 527 group called the American Issues Project. The AIP last week brought out the most negative ad in the campaign so far. It linked Obama to Bill Ayers, a former radical with the Weather Underground Organisation, which planted bombs in the 1960s. Ayers, now an academic, once sat on the board of an anti-poverty group alongside Obama and they have other minor connections. The ad, however, used the imagery of 9/11 to paint Obama as being friends with terrorists. Many more AIP ads will be in the works.</p> <p>It's not just the 527s. There is an industry devoted to publishing anti-Obama screeds. The most popular has been The Obama Nation, by conservative polemicist Jerome Corsi. The book paints a radical picture of Obama as having a secret Islamic past - but critics say the book can be proven to be wrong. Corsi has also called for Obama to take a drugs test and warned that he might create a 'department of hate crimes' if elected. The Obama Nation has been a bestseller, relentlessly promoted by sympathetic media figures such as Fox News's conservative host Sean Hannity. On his show, Hannity allowed Corsi to claim Obama wanted to allow women to have 'abortions' even after their child was born. Instead of refuting the ridiculous claim, Hannity merely expressed shock. The incident forced a liberal media watchdog to issue an analysis showing Obama had never actually supported the murder of newborn children.</p> <p>Yet Hannity is just one of a pantheon of conservative media figures who echo the claims of the Republican machine and convey them to the general public in their millions. They include TV hosts such as Glenn Beck on CNN (who last week called Obama a 'Marxist'), Matt Drudge on the internet and radio personalities such as Rush Limbaugh, the most powerful single broadcaster in America with an estimated 20 million listeners a week on 600 stations. Limbaugh frequently paints Obama as benefiting from 'affirmative action' in his political career. He also makes frequent reference to Obama's middle name, Hussein. Both are clumsy ways of inflaming racial and religious issues at the ballot box. They might also be effective. </p> <p>The father of the modern Republican attack machine was Lee Atwater, a South Carolina native with a passion for blues guitar and brutal politics who, before he died of brain cancer in 1991, wrote letters of apology to many of those his aggressive campaigning had destroyed. </p> <p>Before his profound change of heart Atwater changed the face of American politics. During the 1970s Atwater showed a flair for making the personal into the political. His tactics were condemned but they were effective, most notably in the destruction of Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis in 1988 and the election of George Bush senior. Dukakis was accused of being a depressive, his wife was attacked as having once burned an American flag and finally he was hit by the infamous race-baiting ad that featured black murderer Willie Horton who committed armed robbery and rape after being released on a weekend furlough programme. 'Lee Atwater ruined the business of politics. It all began with him,' said McAuliffe.</p> <p>Atwater also mentored the young Karl Rove. Rove, in his turn, mentored Schmidt. 'There is a reason why Steve Schmidt, who was mentored by Rove who was mentored by Atwater, is running John McCain's campaign,' said Joe Conason, author of the book Big Lies. That reason is simple - these tactics work. When Republicans are shunning Bush's record, attacking Obama personally is the strongest course of action. </p> <p>Obama's campaign is determined not to repeat the mistakes of Kerry, Al Gore and Dukakis. It has been pushing back hard. McCain's recent admission that he did not know how many houses he owned was ruthlessly exploited. The Obama campaign has appeared to use coded language that refers disparagingly to McCain's age. In his acceptance speech on Thursday night Obama did not shy away from strong language attacking McCain. Indeed he made veiled threats to deliver more, almost goading McCain to make the election a personal fight.</p> <p>The Obama camp has also aggressively rebutted the flood of attack ads. Websites have been set up to prove many claims wrong. When the AIP ad on Ayers hit the airwaves last week, Obama staffers directly contacted TV stations and asked them not to run it. Some did, but others did not. Even Fox News stayed away from it. The campaign then went to the Justice Department, asking the ad to be taken off the air. That sort of attitude has a whiff of the hardball attitude that Bill Clinton used to get to the White House. The Corsi book also met an instant wave of rebuttal which helped dent its impact. 'Corsi's book has not really succeeded. Not like the Swift Boats did,' said Conason.</p> <p>Obama has learned how to defend himself but the Democratic attack machine is still far smaller than its Republican equivalent. Never the less we already know what a concerted effort to attack McCain looks like. The Republican machine tore into him in 2000 when he was running in the primaries against Bush. Then, with Rove at the helm, McCain was painted as a mentally unstable man who might have fathered an illegitimate black child. That destroyed his chances.</p> <p>Now that same machine is backing McCain. This week in St Paul it will be gearing itself up to try to repeat its five wins in the past seven elections. Yet, amid the smears and muck-raking, perhaps there is something even greater at stake than the White House. Just months before he died, ravaged by a terrible cancer and barely able to move, Atwater wrote an article for Life magazine. In it he appealed for future political leaders to correct the power-hungry style of politics he himself had perfected. </p> <p>'They must be made to speak to this spiritual vacuum at the heart of American society, this tumour of the soul,' he wrote. But, as the McCain camp prepares for the final leg of the election, most Republican operatives will be thinking only of Atwater's many victories. Few will be considering what they cost and his deathbed plea for change.</p> <h2>Who are the attack dogs?</h2> <p><strong>Sean Hannity</strong></p> <p>No one makes Fox News's claim to be 'fair and balanced' more patently ridiculous than Hannity. The conservative talk show host is as right-wing as they come and a highly effective cipher for Republican propaganda. He co-hosts his show with liberal Alan Colmes, but Colmes is reduced to the role of whipping boy rather than an alternative point of view. Hannity has championed the work of Jerome Corsi. </p> <p><strong>Jerome Corsi</strong></p> <p>Corsi makes a living out of writing muckraking books that appear to favour polemic over accuracy. The Cleveland native first took aim at John Kerry, penning a tome called Unfit for Command. But his greatest 'success' has been The Obama Nation. It has become a New York Times bestseller with its slanderous take on Obama's life and politics. Say the title quickly and it turns into 'abomination'. Corsi probably thinks this is funny.</p> <p><strong>Rush Limbaugh</strong></p> <p>A colossus of US conservatism, his radio show is heard by millions across the country. His rants espouse a deeply conservative point of view that believes global warming does not exist and terrorists lurk behind every corner. He frequently makes an issue of Barack Obama's race - but asked his listeners to back Obama in the Democratic race in what he called Operation Chaos as part of a strategy to keep the campaign as split as possible.</p> <p><strong>Glenn Beck</strong></p> <p>Conservative radio and television host and self-styled critic of political correctness. Once said of radical film-maker Michael Moore, 'I'm wondering if I could kill him myself, or if I would need to hire someone to do it. No, I think I could.' Recently asked an American pastor on air: 'Is Barack Obama the Antichrist?' Has also written two bestselling books: An Inconvenient Book and The Real America: Messages from the Heart and Heartland.</p> <p><strong>Steve Schmidt</strong></p> <p>Known as 'the Bullet' for his bald pate and hardball tactics, Schmidt is the new mastermind of John McCain's attack strategy. He is ruthlessly disciplined and likes to operate behind the scenes. He is also very effective, helping to destroy John Kerry in 2004 and getting Arnold Schwarzenegger re-elected as governor of California in 2006. Unusually for a campaign professional, he is said to loathe Washington DC and prefers his home near the famously liberal city of San Francisco.</p>",
  "<p>Russian president Dmitri Medvedev last week said that he does not want a Second Cold War, but is prepared for one if necessary. Clearly, before waging its campaign to annex South Ossetia from Georgia, the Kremlin audited its relations with the West and concluded it has little to lose if they deteriorate.</p> <p>That calculation is based on the view that Russia was cheated in the post-communist settlement. Moscow surrendered its military and economic empire in Europe, but whenever it subsequently raised objections to US policy there - over Nato enlargement; independence for Kosovo; the establishment of a missile defence shield - it was sternly rebuffed. So it is better, in the Kremlin's analysis, to be feared as a rival power than sidelined as a subordinate one. </p> <p>That calculation says as much about the relative weakness of the West as it does about new Russian strength. </p> <p>Nato, bogged down in Afghanistan, lacks a clear strategic purpose. The Washington doctrine of using force to spread democracy has been tested to destruction in Iraq. The credit crunch and high oil prices have drained the US and Western Europe of cash. That gives an advantage to countries with hoards of capital to invest, such as China, or with energy to export, such as Russia. For the first time since the collapse of communism, the financial muscle of authoritarian states has as much bearing on the direction of the world economy as the wealth of liberal democracies.</p> <p>That is a shift in global balance of power. It is also a rebuttal of the post-Cold War idea that the world was converging towards Western-style capitalism. It was assumed that economic prosperity and political freedom were indivisible. As societies become richer, the theory went, a middle class would emerge to demand representation from its rulers.</p> <p>That view failed to account for the return of nationalism as a rival ideology to democracy. In both Russia and China, authoritarian regimes have persuaded their new wealthy elites to trade freedom for economic stability and global prestige. This is a new social contract: the state allows you to get rich, as long as you do not use the money for political ends. </p> <p>For the last decade, the West has seen militant Islam as the main ideological opponent to liberal capitalism. Before the South Ossetian war, when diplomats discussed a 'new Cold War', it was as likely to envisage Iran as Russia on the opposing side. That preoccupation has resulted in a failure to understand the challenge of nationalist capitalism. </p> <p>America and Britain talk about human rights and democracy as if their benefits are self-evident and universal. But when it suits their strategic aims, in Latin America, Central Asia or the Middle East, they collaborate with brutal dictatorships. So it is hard, in many parts of the world, to distinguish between the promotion of Western 'values' and the crude enforcement of Western interests.</p> <p>That confusion dogs the argument over Nato expansion. Membership is open, in theory, to countries that meet stringent criteria of political reform. But when David Miliband made a solidarity visit to Ukraine in the wake of the Georgia-Russia war, his emphasis was not on the measures Kiev can take to make itself an attractive partner for alliance. Instead, he berated Russia for failing to accept the reality of the post-Soviet world.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the Kremlin has demonstrated it has the power to change that reality, unilaterally, by force. It also claims to be following the example of Western interventions in Kosovo and Iraq when doing so.</p> <p>American and European interests will not be served by military grandstanding and asserting the moral superiority of their political systems. The West has never successfully exported its values by force, but it has made them an attractive commodity for countries to import. After the Cold War, communist societies were persuaded to change not by Western rhetoric, but by the economic reality that they could not compete with capitalism. But China and Russia have since concluded that authoritarian nationalism can compete with political liberalism.</p> <p>That might suit the interests of regimes in Beijing and Moscow, but it would ultimately be a tragedy for the people they rule. Far better they be persuaded that political pluralism, individual liberties and human rights are values to be embraced, not because the West says they are, but because their rigorous application in Western societies yields manifest global success. Westernisation must be an aspiration, not a threat.</p> <p>This new Cold War will be won not by preaching democracy, but by practising it.</p>",

  "<p>Russia's strategy to revise the post-Soviet order in what it calls its \"near abroad\" will be pursued with even more perseverance following its victory over Georgia. Europe should have no illusions about this and should begin to prepare itself. But, as the European Union ponders what to do, cold realism, not hysterical overreaction, is in order. </p> <p>Unfortunately, equating the current situation in the Caucasus with the Soviet Union's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague_Spring\">invasion of Czechoslovakia</a> in 1968 does not attest to this kind of realism. Neither the west nor Nato constitutes the decisive strategic threat facing Russia, which comes from the Islamic south and from the Far East, in particular the emerging superpower, China. Moreover, Russia's strength is in no way comparable to that of the former Soviet Union. </p> <p>Indeed, demographically, Russia is undergoing a dramatic decline. Apart from commodity exports, it has little to offer to the global economy. Notwithstanding booming oil and gas revenues, its infrastructure remains underdeveloped, and successful economic modernisation is a long way off. Likewise, its political and legal system is authoritarian, and its numerous minority problems remain unsolved. As a result, Russia's current challenging of the territorial integrity of Georgia might prove to be a grave error in the not-so-distant future. </p> <p>Given this structural weakness, the idea of a new Cold War is misleading. The Cold War was an endurance race between two similarly strong rivals, the weaker of which eventually had to give up. Russia does not have the capacity to wage another struggle of that type. Nevertheless, as a restored great power, the new Russia will for the time being attempt to ride in the slipstream of other great powers for as long as doing so coincides with its possibilities and interests; it will concentrate on its own sphere of influence and on its role as a global energy power; and it will otherwise make use of its opportunities on a global scale to limit America's power. But it will not be able to seriously challenge the United States \u2013 or looking towards the future, China \u2013 in ways that the Soviet Union once did. </p> <p>It is now clear that in the future, Russia will once again pursue its vital interests with military force \u2013 particularly in its \"near abroad\". But Europe must never accept a renewal of Russian great power politics, which operates according to the idea that might makes right. Indeed, it is here that Russia's renewed confrontation with the west begins, because the new Europe is based on the principle of the inviolability of boundaries, peaceful conflict resolution, and the rule of law, so to forgo this principle for the benefit of imperial zones of influence would amount to self-abandonment. Further eastward expansion of Nato, however, will be possible only against fierce Russian resistance. Nor will this kind of policy in any way create more security, because it entails making promises that won't be kept in an emergency \u2013 as we now see in Georgia. </p> <p>For too long, the west has ignored Russia's recovery of strength and was not prepared to accept the consequences. But not only Russia has changed; so has the entire world. America's neo-conservatives have wasted a large part of their country's power and moral authority in an unnecessary war in Iraq, weakening the only global western power. China, India, Brazil, Russia, and the Persian Gulf today are the world economy's new growth centers and will soon be centers of power to be reckoned with. In view of these realities, the threat of exclusion from the G8 doesn't really feel earth shattering to Russia. Europe's disunity and impotence underline this image of a West that has partially lost touch with geo-political realities. </p> <p>The response to the return of Russia's imperial great power politics has nothing to do with punishing Russia, and a lot to do with establishing innately Western \u2013 especially European \u2013 positions of power. This requires several measures: </p> <p>\u0095 A new political dynamism vis-\u00e0-vis Turkey to link this country, one crucial for European security, permanently to Europe; </p> <p>\u0095 Putting a stop to Moscow's divide-and-conquer politics by adopting a common EU energy policy; </p> <p>\u0095 Serious initiative for strengthening Europe's defence capabilities; </p> <p>\u0095 A greater EU commitment to Ukraine to safeguard its independence; </p> <p>\u0095 A greater freedom of travel for all the EU's Eastern neighbours. </p> <p>All of this, and much more, is needed to send a clear signal to Russia that Europe is unwilling to stand idly by as it returns to great power politics. </p> <p>Presumably, none of this will happen, and it is precisely such inaction that is, in large part, the cause of Russia's strength and Europe's weakness. At the same time, however, one shouldn't lose sight of the joint interests linking Russia and the west. Cooperative relations should be maintained as far as possible. </p> <p>It is blatantly obvious that for Russia's elites, weakness and cooperation are mutually exclusive. Therefore, whoever wants cooperation with Russia \u2013 which is in Europe's interest \u2013 must be strong. That is the lesson from the violence in the Caucasus that Europe must urgently take to heart. </p> <p><strong>Copyright: <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org\">Project Syndicate</a>/Institute for Human Sciences, 2008.</strong></p>",

  "<p>The words \"Herefordshire countryside\" evoke the epitome of English sweetness, but I can assure you that it ain't necessarily so. I spent Friday morning reconnoitring the route that a sturdy posse of Guardian readers and writers took yesterday to celebrate a century of female contributors to the paper's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/countrydiary\">country diary</a>.</p> <p>You see the need for such vigilant, observant recorders as soon as you encounter your first firmly locked gate or a heap of glutinous manure piled across the long distance footpath, the <a href=\"http://www.herefordshiretrail.com/\">Herefordshire Trail</a>. No offence to the county's farmers; they have an important job to do, crops to protect and animals that mustn't stray on to the Abergavenny road. </p> <p>It is up to us, the visitors from towns, to learn how to navigate this beautiful but busily working landscape. When we've done so on this occasion, taking a six-mile loop from Kilpeck with its wonderfully-carved <a href=\"http://hoary.org/snaps/engl/kilp.html\">Norman church</a>, we will raise a cup of celebratory tea to 11 women who have made such operations easier and infinitely more rewarding.</p> <p>Their work makes up the new collection of Guardian country diaries, <a href=\"http://www.guardianbooks.co.uk/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/productSearch_10401_25501_132727_100___10_SimpleSearch_2_1_2__basicSearch_blossom\">A Good Year for Blossom</a>, which leaves the reader in no doubt about the quality of the women who broke a long-standing male monopoly. In the vanguard from 1915 was the prominent suffragette Helena Swanwick, sister of the painter Walter Sickert. By her side, in the 1920s, stood Janet Case, the modest but determined scholar who tutored Virginia Woolf in Greek.</p> <p>They were joined in the 1930s by Katherine Arnold-Foster, better known under her maiden name of Ka Cox, the beautiful partner of Rupert Brooke at Cambridge and, almost certainly, mother of his stillborn child. Then came sturdy, irrepressible Gwen McBryde, described by her great friend M R James, the peerless ghost story writer, as \"a chirpy sort of person\". For 20 years from 1939, she chirped in the Manchester Guardian from Dippersmoor Manor in Herefordshire. That's where we are having our tea and walk.</p> <p>McBryde was a model for much younger women who have had to learn the demands of running both a family and work. Just to sit among the rambling, Elizabethan beauty of Dippersmoor, as I am doing now, is to realise the extent of the challenge she faced. Widowed at 20, when she was four months pregnant, she took on this huge place and ran its farm triumphantly. Her diaries describe the hows and whys, and a marvellous cast of helpers: from a bee-keeping neighbour in her nineties to London evacuee children and opera-singing Italian prisoners of war.</p> <p>She, and her successors, also beat out a path for women writers every bit as effectively as we did on our reconnaissance of overgrown stiles and blocked gates this morning. Helped by largely unsung pioneers, such as Mary Day, the editor of Farmers' Weekly (which also commissioned McBryde in the 1930s), they laid the foundations for the parity with men which women have almost achieved in terms of regular contributors to the country diary.</p> <p>They are nearly there. Another couple of appointments by Celia Locks, the column's current editor, and authorship will be half and half. It has taken 100 years, but as A Good Year for Blossom shows, the women have more than earned their fair share.</p>",
  "<p>It's that time again. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/jul/18/schooltables\">A-level and GCSE exam results</a> have come out and grades have gone up, as they have gone up year on year for \u2026 well I'm not sure but it feels like a hell of a long time.</p> <p>Once again there's been a fair bit of grumbling about standards and their inevitable and catastrophic fall. Or is it their wonderful and meteoric rise? That rather depends on your point of view. This time round Civitas was putting up a stalwart defence of the fall scenario and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/22/gcses.schools\">Andrew Adonis</a> came out fighting for the rise. </p> <p>In an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/nov/12/onwardchristianteachers\">article</a> published in these pages way back in November, AC Grayling made a passing reference to the statistical gulf between the number of students of the international baccalaureate who achieve the highest grade and the number of British students who gain three grade As at A-level. It's a startling statistic and it's worth repeating. Just 0.28% of students gain the highest pass marks in the bac, whilst 25% of British students leave school with three grades As.</p> <p>Of course we are not comparing like with like. The baccalaureate and A levels are two dramatically different systems of examination, not only in terms of content but in terms of academic culture.</p> <p>In France, home of the baccalaureate, students understand about failure. There is no question of failing being a kind of \"deferred success\". Failure is failure, pure and simple and the students are used to it. They expect it. They expect it because the academic culture makes it inevitable. In the state exams such as the agr\u00e9gation, with their epic 7-hour papers, it is understood that even strong candidates fail first time round and only a set number will pass at all.</p> <p>Students also expect to get pretty low marks. The pass mark for classes at school and university (and indeed at the hallowed grandes \u00e9coles) is 10 out of 20. If you get 11 that's nothing to be ashamed of, because frankly there's bound to be someone who got less, and there's bound to be someone else who failed altogether. Twelve's a pretty good mark, 13 is something to be really chuffed about, and if you make it to the heady heights of a 14 or a 15 you can expect a few envious looks from your peers.</p> <p>All of this sets a standard, a high standard, which very many students never attain. In a good old-fashioned manner it sorts a certain kind of academic wheat from the unhappy and failing chaff. But it also makes for a highly competitive and unforgiving educational environment and, in my experience at least, a hardworking but oddly quiescent student body. So if we really want baccalaureate students and baccalaureate standards we need to recognise that we're talking about a drastic change, not of examiners, but of the examined.</p>",
  "<p>Back in 2000, Gordon Brown promised that \"within 10-20 years no one should be seriously disadvantaged by where they live\". Since then, the government's neighbourhood renewal fund has tried to improve employment, health, housing and schools in our most deprived areas. Progress has been made, but not enough. </p> <p>Two reports this week show that inequalities within and between our cities are still very stark. Far too many people are still disadvantaged by where they live. </p> <p>The UK now has 3 million households where no one is in full-time work, according to the <a href=\"http://www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/Prep/8552.asp\">Office of National Statistics</a>. That affects almost 1.8 million children in Britain \u2013 one in seven. Most of these families live in the most run-down parts of our cities. Your chances of being in full-time work are much lower in Hull than in Cambridge. </p> <p>Life expectancy is also massively different depending on where you live, according to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/aug/28/health.socialexclusion\">World Health Organisation</a>. If you live in Calton in Glasgow, your neighbours on average die aged 54. But if you live in nearby Lenzie, you can expect to live until 82. In London, average life expectancy in leafy Hampstead is 11 years longer than in St Pancras, just a couple of miles down the road.</p> <p>Poor health is not just the result of the so-called \"postcode lottery\" in the NHS. It's due to the wider urban environment in our poorest communities. Low employment rates and low incomes. Poor schools and housing. These all contribute to the poor health and short life expectancy in places like Calton.</p> <p>One way to tackle poor health is to raise employment rates in the poorest bits of our cities. Overall, the UK has more people in work than ever before. But we still have too many areas with too many people not in employment, and these are concentrated in many of our cities. </p> <p>Recent research from the Centre for Cities confirmed that worklessness is <a href=\" http://www.centreforcities.org/index.php?id=537\">largely an urban problem</a>. England's cities contain 59% of the country's population, but over 68% of those claiming benefits and 64% of the workless. Cities such as Liverpool illustrate the scale of the challenge, with a quarter of its working-age population on benefits. That's almost double the English average. </p> <p>Worklessness is not just a problem for Britain's largest cities. Hull and Hastings also have very high proportions of their working-age population on benefits.</p> <p>Low employment and worklessness are an urban problem, and require a tailored, city-level solution. \"Postcode lottery\" may be a problem in the NHS, but it's not a universal problem. Our cities each need to take their own unique approach to worklessness, tailored to their own labour markets and the skills of their residents. </p> <p>Our cities also need more powers to increase their employment rates. There's been plenty of devolution talk from ministers. James Purnell recently promised more \"power to the people\" and \"triple devolution\" to people, service providers and communities. But we've not yet seen any radical devolution of financial or political powers to city leaders. </p> <p>One of the reasons why regeneration funding has under-delivered over the past decade has been the over-centralised way that government has spent it. New programmes, like the working neighbourhoods fund, will be more effective if they genuinely devolve funding and powers to people in communities and across real city economies. </p> <p>Cities such as Liverpool and Birmingham now need more freedom to take their own approach to tackling worklessness, based on the needs of their local labour markets. This means direct control over training budgets, through new powerful skills and employment boards. These would set budgets for local back-to-work and training programmes \u2013 using funds devolved from the DWP, Jobcentre Plus and the proposed Skills and Funding Agency.</p> <p>This is now happening in the capital with the London Skills and Employment Board, chaired by the mayor, Boris Johnson. It's starting to influence job training across London. It will allow London's employers to have a bigger say over training programmes, and should help to increase the capital's relatively low employment rate \u2013 which at 70% is well below the national rate of 75%. </p> <p>Increasing employment in our poorest areas will help to improve the health of people who live there. But trying to do all that from Whitehall will not work. Cities are best placed to sort out their own labour markets, with support from the centre. More powerful cities stand a better chance of improving employment prospects in their poorest areas. That's the best prescription for economic growth and healthy communities.</p> <p><em>This article was amended on Monday September 1, at 10.30am.</em></p>"
